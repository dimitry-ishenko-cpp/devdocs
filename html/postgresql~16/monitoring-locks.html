<h1>28.3. Viewing Locks </h1>    <p>Another useful tool for monitoring database activity is the <code class="structname">pg_locks</code> system table. It allows the database administrator to view information about the outstanding locks in the lock manager. For example, this capability can be used to:</p>  <ul> <li> <p>View all the locks currently outstanding, all the locks on relations in a particular database, all the locks on a particular relation, or all the locks held by a particular PostgreSQL session.</p> </li> <li> <p>Determine the relation in the current database with the most ungranted locks (which might be a source of contention among database clients).</p> </li> <li> <p>Determine the effect of lock contention on overall database performance, as well as the extent to which contention varies with overall database traffic.</p> </li> </ul>  <p>Details of the <code class="structname">pg_locks</code> view appear in <a class="xref" href="view-pg-locks.html" title="54.12. pg_locks">Section 54.12</a>. For more information on locking and managing concurrency with PostgreSQL, refer to <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/mvcc.html" title="Chapter 13. Concurrency Control">Chapter 13</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
