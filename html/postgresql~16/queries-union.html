<h1>7.4. Combining Queries (<code class="literal">UNION</code>, <code class="literal">INTERSECT</code>, <code class="literal">EXCEPT</code>) </h1>    <p>The results of two queries can be combined using the set operations union, intersection, and difference. The syntax is</p> <pre data-language="sql">
query1 UNION [ALL] query2
query1 INTERSECT [ALL] query2
query1 EXCEPT [ALL] query2
</pre> <p>where <code>query1</code> and <code>query2</code> are queries that can use any of the features discussed up to this point.</p> <p><code class="literal" id="union">UNION</code> effectively appends the result of <code>query2</code> to the result of <code>query1</code> (although there is no guarantee that this is the order in which the rows are actually returned). Furthermore, it eliminates duplicate rows from its result, in the same way as <code class="literal">DISTINCT</code>, unless <code class="literal">UNION ALL</code> is used.</p> <p><code class="literal" id="intersect">INTERSECT</code> returns all rows that are both in the result of <code>query1</code> and in the result of <code>query2</code>. Duplicate rows are eliminated unless <code class="literal">INTERSECT ALL</code> is used.</p> <p><code class="literal" id="except">EXCEPT</code> returns all rows that are in the result of <code>query1</code> but not in the result of <code>query2</code>. (This is sometimes called the <em class="firstterm">difference</em> between two queries.) Again, duplicates are eliminated unless <code class="literal">EXCEPT ALL</code> is used.</p> <p>In order to calculate the union, intersection, or difference of two queries, the two queries must be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">union compatible</span>”</span>, which means that they return the same number of columns and the corresponding columns have compatible data types, as described in <a class="xref" href="typeconv-union-case.html" title="10.5. UNION, CASE, and Related Constructs">Section 10.5</a>.</p> <p>Set operations can be combined, for example</p> <pre data-language="sql">
query1 UNION query2 EXCEPT query3
</pre> <p>which is equivalent to</p> <pre data-language="sql">
(query1 UNION query2) EXCEPT query3
</pre> <p>As shown here, you can use parentheses to control the order of evaluation. Without parentheses, <code class="literal">UNION</code> and <code class="literal">EXCEPT</code> associate left-to-right, but <code class="literal">INTERSECT</code> binds more tightly than those two operators. Thus</p> <pre data-language="sql">
query1 UNION query2 INTERSECT query3
</pre> <p>means</p> <pre data-language="sql">
query1 UNION (query2 INTERSECT query3)
</pre> <p>You can also surround an individual <code>query</code> with parentheses. This is important if the <code>query</code> needs to use any of the clauses discussed in following sections, such as <code class="literal">LIMIT</code>. Without parentheses, you'll get a syntax error, or else the clause will be understood as applying to the output of the set operation rather than one of its inputs. For example,</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT a FROM b UNION SELECT x FROM y LIMIT 10
</pre> <p>is accepted, but it means</p> <pre data-language="sql">
(SELECT a FROM b UNION SELECT x FROM y) LIMIT 10
</pre> <p>not</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT a FROM b UNION (SELECT x FROM y LIMIT 10)
