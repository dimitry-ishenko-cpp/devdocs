<h1>21.7. SSPI Authentication </h1>    <p>SSPI is a Windows technology for secure authentication with single sign-on. PostgreSQL will use SSPI in <code class="literal">negotiate</code> mode, which will use Kerberos when possible and automatically fall back to NTLM in other cases. SSPI and GSSAPI interoperate as clients and servers, e.g., an SSPI client can authenticate to an GSSAPI server. It is recommended to use SSPI on Windows clients and servers and GSSAPI on non-Windows platforms.</p> <p>When using Kerberos authentication, SSPI works the same way GSSAPI does; see <a class="xref" href="gssapi-auth.html" title="21.6. GSSAPI Authentication">Section 21.6</a> for details.</p> <p>The following configuration options are supported for SSPI:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code class="literal">include_realm</code></dt> <dd> <p>If set to 0, the realm name from the authenticated user principal is stripped off before being passed through the user name mapping (<a class="xref" href="auth-username-maps.html" title="21.2. User Name Maps">Section 21.2</a>). This is discouraged and is primarily available for backwards compatibility, as it is not secure in multi-realm environments unless <code class="literal">krb_realm</code> is also used. It is recommended to leave <code class="literal">include_realm</code> set to the default (1) and to provide an explicit mapping in <code class="filename">pg_ident.conf</code> to convert principal names to PostgreSQL user names.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">compat_realm</code></dt> <dd> <p>If set to 1, the domain's SAM-compatible name (also known as the NetBIOS name) is used for the <code class="literal">include_realm</code> option. This is the default. If set to 0, the true realm name from the Kerberos user principal name is used.</p> <p>Do not disable this option unless your server runs under a domain account (this includes virtual service accounts on a domain member system) and all clients authenticating through SSPI are also using domain accounts, or authentication will fail.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">upn_username</code></dt> <dd> <p>If this option is enabled along with <code class="literal">compat_realm</code>, the user name from the Kerberos UPN is used for authentication. If it is disabled (the default), the SAM-compatible user name is used. By default, these two names are identical for new user accounts.</p> <p>Note that libpq uses the SAM-compatible name if no explicit user name is specified. If you use libpq or a driver based on it, you should leave this option disabled or explicitly specify user name in the connection string.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">map</code></dt> <dd> <p>Allows for mapping between system and database user names. See <a class="xref" href="auth-username-maps.html" title="21.2. User Name Maps">Section 21.2</a> for details. For an SSPI/Kerberos principal, such as <code class="literal">username@EXAMPLE.COM</code> (or, less commonly, <code class="literal">username/hostbased@EXAMPLE.COM</code>), the user name used for mapping is <code class="literal">username@EXAMPLE.COM</code> (or <code class="literal">username/hostbased@EXAMPLE.COM</code>, respectively), unless <code class="literal">include_realm</code> has been set to 0, in which case <code class="literal">username</code> (or <code class="literal">username/hostbased</code>) is what is seen as the system user name when mapping.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">krb_realm</code></dt> <dd> <p>Sets the realm to match user principal names against. If this parameter is set, only users of that realm will be accepted. If it is not set, users of any realm can connect, subject to whatever user name mapping is done.</p> </dd> </dl> </div><div class="_attribution">
