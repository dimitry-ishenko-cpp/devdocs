Problems</a></dt> </dl> </div> <p><em class="firstterm">Locale</em> support refers to an application respecting cultural preferences regarding alphabets, sorting, number formatting, etc. PostgreSQL uses the standard ISO C and POSIX locale facilities provided by the server operating system. For additional information refer to the documentation of your system.</p> <div class="sect2" id="LOCALE-OVERVIEW">    <h2 class="title">24.1.1. Overview </h2>    <p>Locale support is automatically initialized when a database cluster is created using <code class="command">initdb</code>. <code class="command">initdb</code> will initialize the database cluster with the locale setting of its execution environment by default, so if your system is already set to use the locale that you want in your database cluster then there is nothing else you need to do. If you want to use a different locale (or you are not sure which locale your system is set to), you can instruct <code class="command">initdb</code> exactly which locale to use by specifying the <code class="option">--locale</code> option. For example:</p> <pre>
initdb --locale=sv_SE
</pre> <p>This example for Unix systems sets the locale to Swedish (<code class="literal">sv</code>) as spoken in Sweden (<code class="literal">SE</code>). Other possibilities might include <code class="literal">en_US</code> (U.S. English) and <code class="literal">fr_CA</code> (French Canadian). If more than one character set can be used for a locale then the specifications can take the form <code>language_territory.codeset</code>. For example, <code class="literal">fr_BE.UTF-8</code> represents the French language (fr) as spoken in Belgium (BE), with a UTF-8 character set encoding.</p> <p>What locales are available on your system under what names depends on what was provided by the operating system vendor and what was installed. On most Unix systems, the command <code class="literal">locale -a</code> will provide a list of available locales. Windows uses more verbose locale names, such as <code class="literal">German_Germany</code> or <code class="literal">Swedish_Sweden.1252</code>, but the principles are the same.</p> <p>Occasionally it is useful to mix rules from several locales, e.g., use English collation rules but Spanish messages. To support that, a set of locale subcategories exist that control only certain aspects of the localization rules:</p> <div class="informaltable"> <table class="informaltable"> <colgroup> <col class="col1"> <col class="col2"> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td><code class="envar">LC_COLLATE</code></td> <td>String sort order</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="envar">LC_CTYPE</code></td> <td>Character classification (What is a letter? Its upper-case equivalent?)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="envar">LC_MESSAGES</code></td> <td>Language of messages</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="envar">LC_MONETARY</code></td> <td>Formatting of currency amounts</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="envar">LC_NUMERIC</code></td> <td>Formatting of numbers</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="envar">LC_TIME</code></td> <td>Formatting of dates and times</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>The category names translate into names of <code class="command">initdb</code> options to override the locale choice for a specific category. For instance, to set the locale to French Canadian, but use U.S. rules for formatting currency, use <code class="literal">initdb --locale=fr_CA --lc-monetary=en_US</code>.</p> <p>If you want the system to behave as if it had no locale support, use the special locale name <code class="literal">C</code>, or equivalently <code class="literal">POSIX</code>.</p> <p>Some locale categories must have their values fixed when the database is created. You can use different settings for different databases, but once a database is created, you cannot change them for that database anymore. <code class="literal">LC_COLLATE</code> and <code class="literal">LC_CTYPE</code> are these categories. They affect the sort order of indexes, so they must be kept fixed, or indexes on text columns would become corrupt. (But you can alleviate this restriction using collations, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="collation.html" title="24.2. Collation Support">Section 24.2</a>.) The default values for these categories are determined when <code class="command">initdb</code> is run, and those values are used when new databases are created, unless specified otherwise in the <code class="command">CREATE DATABASE</code> command.</p> <p>The other locale categories can be changed whenever desired by setting the server configuration parameters that have the same name as the locale categories (see <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-FORMAT" title="20.11.2. Locale and Formatting">Section 20.11.2</a> for details). The values that are chosen by <code class="command">initdb</code> are actually only written into the configuration file <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code> to serve as defaults when the server is started. If you remove these assignments from <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code> then the server will inherit the settings from its execution environment.</p> <p>Note that the locale behavior of the server is determined by the environment variables seen by the server, not by the environment of any client. Therefore, be careful to configure the correct locale settings before starting the server. A consequence of this is that if client and server are set up in different locales, messages might appear in different languages depending on where they originated.</p> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>When we speak of inheriting the locale from the execution environment, this means the following on most operating systems: For a given locale category, say the collation, the following environment variables are consulted in this order until one is found to be set: <code class="envar">LC_ALL</code>, <code class="envar">LC_COLLATE</code> (or the variable corresponding to the respective category), <code class="envar">LANG</code>. If none of these environment variables are set then the locale defaults to <code class="literal">C</code>.</p> <p>Some message localization libraries also look at the environment variable <code class="envar">LANGUAGE</code> which overrides all other locale settings for the purpose of setting the language of messages. If in doubt, please refer to the documentation of your operating system, in particular the documentation about gettext.</p> </blockquote> <p>To enable messages to be translated to the user's preferred language, NLS must have been selected at build time (<code class="literal">configure --enable-nls</code>). All other locale support is built in automatically.</p> </div> <div class="sect2" id="LOCALE-BEHAVIOR">    <h2 class="title">24.1.2. Behavior </h2>    <p>The locale settings influence the following SQL features:</p>  <ul> <li> <p id="id-1.6.11.3.5.2.1.1.1.2">Sort order in queries using <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code> or the standard comparison operators on textual data </p> </li> <li> <p id="id-1.6.11.3.5.2.1.2.1.5">The <code class="function">upper</code>, <code class="function">lower</code>, and <code class="function">initcap</code> functions  </p> </li> <li> <p id="id-1.6.11.3.5.2.1.3.1.4">Pattern matching operators (<code class="literal">LIKE</code>, <code class="literal">SIMILAR TO</code>, and POSIX-style regular expressions); locales affect both case insensitive matching and the classification of characters by character-class regular expressions  </p> </li> <li> <p id="id-1.6.11.3.5.2.1.4.1.2">The <code class="function">to_char</code> family of functions </p> </li> <li> <p>The ability to use indexes with <code class="literal">LIKE</code> clauses</p> </li> </ul>  <p>The drawback of using locales other than <code class="literal">C</code> or <code class="literal">POSIX</code> in PostgreSQL is its performance impact. It slows character handling and prevents ordinary indexes from being used by <code class="literal">LIKE</code>. For this reason use locales only if you actually need them.</p> <p>As a workaround to allow PostgreSQL to use indexes with <code class="literal">LIKE</code> clauses under a non-C locale, several custom operator classes exist. These allow the creation of an index that performs a strict character-by-character comparison, ignoring locale comparison rules. Refer to <a class="xref" href="indexes-opclass.html" title="11.10. Operator Classes and Operator Families">Section 11.10</a> for more information. Another approach is to create indexes using the <code class="literal">C</code> collation, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="collation.html" title="24.2. Collation Support">Section 24.2</a>.</p> </div> <div class="sect2" id="LOCALE-SELECTING-LOCALES">    <h2 class="title">24.1.3. Selecting Locales </h2>    <p>Locales can be selected in different scopes depending on requirements. The above overview showed how locales are specified using <code class="command">initdb</code> to set the defaults for the entire cluster. The following list shows where locales can be selected. Each item provides the defaults for the subsequent items, and each lower item allows overriding the defaults on a finer granularity.</p> <div class="orderedlist"> <ol class="orderedlist" type="1"> <li> <p>As explained above, the environment of the operating system provides the defaults for the locales of a newly initialized database cluster. In many cases, this is enough: If the operating system is configured for the desired language/territory, then PostgreSQL will by default also behave according to that locale.</p> </li> <li> <p>As shown above, command-line options for <code class="command">initdb</code> specify the locale settings for a newly initialized database cluster. Use this if the operating system does not have the locale configuration you want for your database system.</p> </li> <li> <p>A locale can be selected separately for each database. The SQL command <code class="command">CREATE DATABASE</code> and its command-line equivalent <code class="command">createdb</code> have options for that. Use this for example if a database cluster houses databases for multiple tenants with different requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Locale settings can be made for individual table columns. This uses an SQL object called <em class="firstterm">collation</em> and is explained in <a class="xref" href="collation.html" title="24.2. Collation Support">Section 24.2</a>. Use this for example to sort data in different languages or customize the sort order of a particular table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, locales can be selected for an individual query. Again, this uses SQL collation objects. This could be used to change the sort order based on run-time choices or for ad-hoc experimentation.</p> </li> </ol> </div> </div> <div class="sect2" id="LOCALE-PROVIDERS">    <h2 class="title">24.1.4. Locale Providers </h2>    <p id="id-1.6.11.3.7.2.5">PostgreSQL supports multiple <em class="firstterm">locale providers</em>. This specifies which library supplies the locale data. One standard provider name is <code class="literal">libc</code>, which uses the locales provided by the operating system C library. These are the locales used by most tools provided by the operating system. Another provider is <code class="literal">icu</code>, which uses the external ICU library. ICU locales can only be used if support for ICU was configured when PostgreSQL was built.</p> <p>The commands and tools that select the locale settings, as described above, each have an option to select the locale provider. The examples shown earlier all use the <code class="literal">libc</code> provider, which is the default. Here is an example to initialize a database cluster using the ICU provider:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
initdb --locale-provider=icu --icu-locale=en
</pre> <p>See the description of the respective commands and programs for details. Note that you can mix locale providers at different granularities, for example use <code class="literal">libc</code> by default for the cluster but have one database that uses the <code class="literal">icu</code> provider, and then have collation objects using either provider within those databases.</p> <p>Which locale provider to use depends on individual requirements. For most basic uses, either provider will give adequate results. For the libc provider, it depends on what the operating system offers; some operating systems are better than others. For advanced uses, ICU offers more locale variants and customization options.</p> </div> <div class="sect2" id="ICU-LOCALES">    <h2 class="title">24.1.5. ICU Locales </h2>    <div class="sect3" id="ICU-LOCALE-NAMES">    <h3 class="title">24.1.5.1. ICU Locale Names </h3>    <p>The ICU format for the locale name is a <a class="link" href="locale.html#ICU-LANGUAGE-TAG" title="24.1.5.3. Language Tag">Language Tag</a>.</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE COLLATION mycollation1 (provider = icu, locale = 'ja-JP');

</pre> </div> <div class="sect3" id="ICU-CANONICALIZATION">    <h3 class="title">24.1.5.2. Locale Canonicalization and Validation </h3>    <p>When defining a new ICU collation object or database with ICU as the provider, the given locale name is transformed ("canonicalized") into a language tag if not already in that form. For instance,</p> <pre>
CREATE COLLATION mycollation3 (provider = icu, locale = 'en-US-u-kn-true');
NOTICE:  using standard form "en-US-u-kn" for locale "en-US-u-kn-true"
CREATE COLLATION mycollation4 (provider = icu, locale = 'de_DE.utf8');
NOTICE:  using standard form "de-DE" for locale "de_DE.utf8"
</pre> <p>If you see this notice, ensure that the <code class="symbol">provider</code> and <code class="symbol">locale</code> are the expected result. For consistent results when using the ICU provider, specify the canonical <a class="link" href="locale.html#ICU-LANGUAGE-TAG" title="24.1.5.3. Language Tag">language tag</a> instead of relying on the transformation.</p> <p>A locale with no language name, or the special language name <code class="literal">root</code>, is transformed to have the language <code class="literal">und</code> ("undefined").</p> <p>ICU can transform most libc locale names, as well as some other formats, into language tags for easier transition to ICU. If a libc locale name is used in ICU, it may not have precisely the same behavior as in libc.</p> <p>If there is a problem interpreting the locale name, or if the locale name represents a language or region that ICU does not recognize, you will see the following warning:</p> <pre>
CREATE COLLATION nonsense (provider = icu, locale = 'nonsense');
WARNING:  ICU locale "nonsense" has unknown language "nonsense"
HINT:  To disable ICU locale validation, set parameter icu_validation_level to DISABLED.
CREATE COLLATION
</pre> <p><a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-ICU-VALIDATION-LEVEL">icu_validation_level</a> controls how the message is reported. Unless set to <code class="literal">ERROR</code>, the collation will still be created, but the behavior may not be what the user intended.</p> </div> <div class="sect3" id="ICU-LANGUAGE-TAG">    <h3 class="title">24.1.5.3. Language Tag </h3>    <p>A language tag, defined in BCP 47, is a standardized identifier used to identify languages, regions, and other information about a locale.</p> <p>Basic language tags are simply <code>language</code><code class="literal">-</code><code>region</code>; or even just <code>language</code>. The <code>language</code> is a language code (e.g. <code class="literal">fr</code> for French), and <code>region</code> is a region code (e.g. <code class="literal">CA</code> for Canada). Examples: <code class="literal">ja-JP</code>, <code class="literal">de</code>, or <code class="literal">fr-CA</code>.</p> <p>Collation settings may be included in the language tag to customize collation behavior. ICU allows extensive customization, such as sensitivity (or insensitivity) to accents, case, and punctuation; treatment of digits within text; and many other options to satisfy a variety of uses.</p> <p>To include this additional collation information in a language tag, append <code class="literal">-u</code>, which indicates there are additional collation settings, followed by one or more <code class="literal">-</code><code>key</code><code class="literal">-</code><code>value</code> pairs. The <code>key</code> is the key for a <a class="link" href="collation.html#ICU-COLLATION-SETTINGS" title="24.2.3.2. Collation Settings for an ICU Locale">collation setting</a> and <code>value</code> is a valid value for that setting. For boolean settings, the <code class="literal">-</code><code>key</code> may be specified without a corresponding <code class="literal">-</code><code>value</code>, which implies a value of <code class="literal">true</code>.</p> <p>For example, the language tag <code class="literal">en-US-u-kn-ks-level2</code> means the locale with the English language in the US region, with collation settings <code class="literal">kn</code> set to <code class="literal">true</code> and <code class="literal">ks</code> set to <code class="literal">level2</code>. Those settings mean the collation will be case-insensitive and treat a sequence of digits as a single number:</p> <pre>
CREATE COLLATION mycollation5 (provider = icu, deterministic = false, locale = 'en-US-u-kn-ks-level2');
SELECT 'aB' = 'Ab' COLLATE mycollation5 as result;
 result

Problems </h2>    <p>If locale support doesn't work according to the explanation above, check that the locale support in your operating system is correctly configured. To check what locales are installed on your system, you can use the command <code class="literal">locale -a</code> if your operating system provides it.</p> <p>Check that PostgreSQL is actually using the locale that you think it is. The <code class="envar">LC_COLLATE</code> and <code class="envar">LC_CTYPE</code> settings are determined when a database is created, and cannot be changed except by creating a new database. Other locale settings including <code class="envar">LC_MESSAGES</code> and <code class="envar">LC_MONETARY</code> are initially determined by the environment the server is started in, but can be changed on-the-fly. You can check the active locale settings using the <code class="command">SHOW</code> command.</p> <p>The directory <code class="filename">src/test/locale</code> in the source distribution contains a test suite for PostgreSQL's locale support.</p> <p>Client applications that handle server-side errors by parsing the text of the error message will obviously have problems when the server's messages are in a different language. Authors of such applications are advised to make use of the error code scheme instead.</p> <p>Maintaining catalogs of message translations requires the on-going efforts of many volunteers that want to see PostgreSQL speak their preferred language well. If messages in your language are currently not available or not fully translated, your assistance would be appreciated.
