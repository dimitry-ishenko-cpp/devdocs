Functional Dependencies </h2>    <p>Multivariate correlation can be demonstrated with a very simple data set — a table with two columns, both containing the same values:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE TABLE t (a INT, b INT);
INSERT INTO t SELECT i % 100, i % 100 FROM generate_series(1, 10000) s(i);
ANALYZE t;
</pre> <p>As explained in <a class="xref" href="planner-stats.html" title="14.2. Statistics Used by the Planner">Section 14.2</a>, the planner can determine cardinality of <code class="structname">t</code> using the number of pages and rows obtained from <code class="structname">pg_class</code>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT relpages, reltuples FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 't';

 relpages | reltuples
----------+-----------
       45 |     10000
</pre> <p>The data distribution is very simple; there are only 100 distinct values in each column, uniformly distributed.</p> <p>The following example shows the result of estimating a <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition on the <code class="structfield">a</code> column:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, TIMING OFF) SELECT * FROM t WHERE a = 1;
                                 QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------
 Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..170.00 rows=100 width=8) (actual rows=100 loops=1)
   Filter: (a = 1)
   Rows Removed by Filter: 9900
</pre> <p>The planner examines the condition and determines the selectivity of this clause to be 1%. By comparing this estimate and the actual number of rows, we see that the estimate is very accurate (in fact exact, as the table is very small). Changing the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition to use the <code class="structfield">b</code> column, an identical plan is generated. But observe what happens if we apply the same condition on both columns, combining them with <code class="literal">AND</code>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, TIMING OFF) SELECT * FROM t WHERE a = 1 AND b = 1;
                                 QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​----------
 Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..195.00 rows=1 width=8) (actual rows=100 loops=1)
   Filter: ((a = 1) AND (b = 1))
   Rows Removed by Filter: 9900
</pre> <p>The planner estimates the selectivity for each condition individually, arriving at the same 1% estimates as above. Then it assumes that the conditions are independent, and so it multiplies their selectivities, producing a final selectivity estimate of just 0.01%. This is a significant underestimate, as the actual number of rows matching the conditions (100) is two orders of magnitude higher.</p> <p>This problem can be fixed by creating a statistics object that directs <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> to calculate functional-dependency multivariate statistics on the two columns:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE STATISTICS stts (dependencies) ON a, b FROM t;
ANALYZE t;
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, TIMING OFF) SELECT * FROM t WHERE a = 1 AND b = 1;
                                  QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------
 Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..195.00 rows=100 width=8) (actual rows=100 loops=1)
   Filter: ((a = 1) AND (b = 1))
   Rows Removed by Filter: 9900
</pre> </div> <div class="sect2" id="MULTIVARIATE-NDISTINCT-COUNTS">    <h2 class="title">76.2.2. Multivariate N-Distinct Counts </h2>    <p>A similar problem occurs with estimation of the cardinality of sets of multiple columns, such as the number of groups that would be generated by a <code class="command">GROUP BY</code> clause. When <code class="command">GROUP BY</code> lists a single column, the n-distinct estimate (which is visible as the estimated number of rows returned by the HashAggregate node) is very accurate:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, TIMING OFF) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t GROUP BY a;
                                       QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​----------------------
 HashAggregate  (cost=195.00..196.00 rows=100 width=12) (actual rows=100 loops=1)
   Group Key: a
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..145.00 rows=10000 width=4) (actual rows=10000 loops=1)
</pre> <p>But without multivariate statistics, the estimate for the number of groups in a query with two columns in <code class="command">GROUP BY</code>, as in the following example, is off by an order of magnitude:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, TIMING OFF) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t GROUP BY a, b;
                                       QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​-------------------------
 HashAggregate  (cost=220.00..230.00 rows=1000 width=16) (actual rows=100 loops=1)
   Group Key: a, b
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..145.00 rows=10000 width=8) (actual rows=10000 loops=1)
</pre> <p>By redefining the statistics object to include n-distinct counts for the two columns, the estimate is much improved:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
DROP STATISTICS stts;
CREATE STATISTICS stts (dependencies, ndistinct) ON a, b FROM t;
ANALYZE t;
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, TIMING OFF) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t GROUP BY a, b;
                                       QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​-------------------------
 HashAggregate  (cost=220.00..221.00 rows=100 width=16) (actual rows=100 loops=1)
   Group Key: a, b
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..145.00 rows=10000 width=8) (actual rows=10000 loops=1)
</pre> </div> <div class="sect2" id="MCV-LISTS">    <h2 class="title">76.2.3. MCV Lists </h2>    <p>As explained in <a class="xref" href="multivariate-statistics-examples.html#FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES" title="76.2.1. Functional Dependencies">Section 76.2.1</a>, functional dependencies are very cheap and efficient type of statistics, but their main limitation is their global nature (only tracking dependencies at the column level, not between individual column values).</p> <p>This section introduces multivariate variant of MCV (most-common values) lists, a straightforward extension of the per-column statistics described in <a class="xref" href="row-estimation-examples.html" title="76.1. Row Estimation Examples">Section 76.1</a>. These statistics address the limitation by storing individual values, but it is naturally more expensive, both in terms of building the statistics in <code class="command">ANALYZE</code>, storage and planning time.</p> <p>Let's look at the query from <a class="xref" href="multivariate-statistics-examples.html#FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES" title="76.2.1. Functional Dependencies">Section 76.2.1</a> again, but this time with a MCV list created on the same set of columns (be sure to drop the functional dependencies, to make sure the planner uses the newly created statistics).</p> <pre data-language="sql">
DROP STATISTICS stts;
CREATE STATISTICS stts2 (mcv) ON a, b FROM t;
ANALYZE t;
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, TIMING OFF) SELECT * FROM t WHERE a = 1 AND b = 1;
                                   QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------
 Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..195.00 rows=100 width=8) (actual rows=100 loops=1)
   Filter: ((a = 1) AND (b = 1))
   Rows Removed by Filter: 9900
</pre> <p>The estimate is as accurate as with the functional dependencies, mostly thanks to the table being fairly small and having a simple distribution with a low number of distinct values. Before looking at the second query, which was not handled by functional dependencies particularly well, let's inspect the MCV list a bit.</p> <p>Inspecting the MCV list is possible using <code class="function">pg_mcv_list_items</code> set-returning function.</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT m.* FROM pg_statistic_ext join pg_statistic_ext_data on (oid = stxoid),
                pg_mcv_list_items(stxdmcv) m WHERE stxname = 'stts2';
 index |  values  | nulls | frequency | base_frequency
-------+----------+-------+-----------+----------------
     0 | {0, 0}   | {f,f} |      0.01 |         0.0001
     1 | {1, 1}   | {f,f} |      0.01 |         0.0001
   ...
    49 | {49, 49} | {f,f} |      0.01 |         0.0001
    50 | {50, 50} | {f,f} |      0.01 |         0.0001
   ...
    97 | {97, 97} | {f,f} |      0.01 |         0.0001
    98 | {98, 98} | {f,f} |      0.01 |         0.0001
    99 | {99, 99} | {f,f} |      0.01 |         0.0001
(100 rows)
</pre> <p>This confirms there are 100 distinct combinations in the two columns, and all of them are about equally likely (1% frequency for each one). The base frequency is the frequency computed from per-column statistics, as if there were no multi-column statistics. Had there been any null values in either of the columns, this would be identified in the <code class="structfield">nulls</code> column.</p> <p>When estimating the selectivity, the planner applies all the conditions on items in the MCV list, and then sums the frequencies of the matching ones. See <code class="function">mcv_clauselist_selectivity</code> in <code class="filename">src/backend/statistics/mcv.c</code> for details.</p> <p>Compared to functional dependencies, MCV lists have two major advantages. Firstly, the list stores actual values, making it possible to decide which combinations are compatible.</p> <pre data-language="sql">
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, TIMING OFF) SELECT * FROM t WHERE a = 1 AND b = 10;
                                 QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​--------
 Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..195.00 rows=1 width=8) (actual rows=0 loops=1)
   Filter: ((a = 1) AND (b = 10))
   Rows Removed by Filter: 10000
</pre> <p>Secondly, MCV lists handle a wider range of clause types, not just equality clauses like functional dependencies. For example, consider the following range query for the same table:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, TIMING OFF) SELECT * FROM t WHERE a &lt;= 49 AND b &gt; 49;
                                QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​--------
 Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..195.00 rows=1 width=8) (actual rows=0 loops=1)
   Filter: ((a &lt;= 49) AND (b &gt; 49))
   Rows Removed by Filter: 10000
