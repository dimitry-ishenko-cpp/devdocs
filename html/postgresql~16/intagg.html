<h1>F.19. intagg â€” integer aggregator and enumerator </h1>    <div class="toc"> <dl class="toc"> <dt><a href="intagg.html#INTAGG-FUNCTIONS">F.19.1. Functions</a></dt> <dt><a href="intagg.html#INTAGG-SAMPLES">F.19.2. Sample Uses</a></dt> </dl> </div> <p>The <code class="filename">intagg</code> module provides an integer aggregator and an enumerator. <code class="filename">intagg</code> is now obsolete, because there are built-in functions that provide a superset of its capabilities. However, the module is still provided as a compatibility wrapper around the built-in functions.</p> <div class="sect2" id="id-1.11.7.29.4.5">    <h2 class="title">F.19.1. Functions </h2>    <p>The aggregator is an aggregate function <code class="function">int_array_aggregate(integer)</code> that produces an integer array containing exactly the integers it is fed. This is a wrapper around <code class="function">array_agg</code>, which does the same thing for any array type.</p> <p>The enumerator is a function <code class="function">int_array_enum(integer[])</code> that returns <code class="type">setof integer</code>. It is essentially the reverse operation of the aggregator: given an array of integers, expand it into a set of rows. This is a wrapper around <code class="function">unnest</code>, which does the same thing for any array type.</p> </div> <div class="sect2" id="INTAGG-SAMPLES">    <h2 class="title">F.19.2. Sample Uses </h2>    <p>Many database systems have the notion of a one to many table. Such a table usually sits between two indexed tables, for example:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE TABLE left (id INT PRIMARY KEY, ...);
CREATE TABLE right (id INT PRIMARY KEY, ...);
CREATE TABLE one_to_many(left INT REFERENCES left, right INT REFERENCES right);
</pre> <p>It is typically used like this:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT right.* from right JOIN one_to_many ON (right.id = one_to_many.right)
  WHERE one_to_many.left = item;
</pre> <p>This will return all the items in the right hand table for an entry in the left hand table. This is a very common construct in SQL.</p> <p>Now, this methodology can be cumbersome with a very large number of entries in the <code class="structname">one_to_many</code> table. Often, a join like this would result in an index scan and a fetch for each right hand entry in the table for a particular left hand entry. If you have a very dynamic system, there is not much you can do. However, if you have some data which is fairly static, you can create a summary table with the aggregator.</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE TABLE summary AS
  SELECT left, int_array_aggregate(right) AS right
  FROM one_to_many
  GROUP BY left;
</pre> <p>This will create a table with one row per left item, and an array of right items. Now this is pretty useless without some way of using the array; that's why there is an array enumerator. You can do</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT left, int_array_enum(right) FROM summary WHERE left = item;
</pre> <p>The above query using <code class="function">int_array_enum</code> produces the same results as</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT left, right FROM one_to_many WHERE left = item;
</pre> <p>The difference is that the query against the summary table has to get only one row from the table, whereas the direct query against <code class="structname">one_to_many</code> must index scan and fetch a row for each entry.</p> <p>On one system, an <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code> showed a query with a cost of 8488 was reduced to a cost of 329. The original query was a join involving the <code class="structname">one_to_many</code> table, which was replaced by:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT right, count(right) FROM
  ( SELECT left, int_array_enum(right) AS right
    FROM summary JOIN (SELECT left FROM left_table WHERE left = item) AS lefts
         ON (summary.left = lefts.left)
  ) AS list
  GROUP BY right
  ORDER BY count DESC;
