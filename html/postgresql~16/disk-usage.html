<h1>29.1. Determining Disk Usage </h1>    <p>Each table has a primary heap disk file where most of the data is stored. If the table has any columns with potentially-wide values, there also might be a TOAST file associated with the table, which is used to store values too wide to fit comfortably in the main table (see <a class="xref" href="storage-toast.html" title="73.2. TOAST">Section 73.2</a>). There will be one valid index on the TOAST table, if present. There also might be indexes associated with the base table. Each table and index is stored in a separate disk file — possibly more than one file, if the file would exceed one gigabyte. Naming conventions for these files are described in <a class="xref" href="storage-file-layout.html" title="73.1. Database File Layout">Section 73.1</a>.</p> <p>You can monitor disk space in three ways: using the SQL functions listed in <a class="xref" href="functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-DBSIZE" title="Table 9.96. Database Object Size Functions">Table 9.96</a>, using the <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/oid2name.html" title="oid2name">oid2name</a> module, or using manual inspection of the system catalogs. The SQL functions are the easiest to use and are generally recommended. The remainder of this section shows how to do it by inspection of the system catalogs.</p> <p>Using psql on a recently vacuumed or analyzed database, you can issue queries to see the disk usage of any table:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT pg_relation_filepath(oid), relpages FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'customer';

 pg_relation_filepath | relpages
----------------------+----------
 base/16384/16806     |       60
(1 row)
</pre> <p>Each page is typically 8 kilobytes. (Remember, <code class="structfield">relpages</code> is only updated by <code class="command">VACUUM</code>, <code class="command">ANALYZE</code>, and a few DDL commands such as <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code>.) The file path name is of interest if you want to examine the table's disk file directly.</p> <p>To show the space used by TOAST tables, use a query like the following:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT relname, relpages
FROM pg_class,
     (SELECT reltoastrelid
      FROM pg_class
      WHERE relname = 'customer') AS ss
WHERE oid = ss.reltoastrelid OR
      oid = (SELECT indexrelid
             FROM pg_index
             WHERE indrelid = ss.reltoastrelid)
ORDER BY relname;

       relname        | relpages
----------------------+----------
 pg_toast_16806       |        0
 pg_toast_16806_index |        1
</pre> <p>You can easily display index sizes, too:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT c2.relname, c2.relpages
FROM pg_class c, pg_class c2, pg_index i
WHERE c.relname = 'customer' AND
      c.oid = i.indrelid AND
      c2.oid = i.indexrelid
ORDER BY c2.relname;

      relname      | relpages
-------------------+----------
 customer_id_index |       26
</pre> <p>It is easy to find your largest tables and indexes using this information:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT relname, relpages
FROM pg_class
ORDER BY relpages DESC;

       relname        | relpages
----------------------+----------
 bigtable             |     3290
 customer             |     3144
