Column Labels</a></dt> <dt><a href="queries-select-lists.html#QUERIES-DISTINCT">7.3.3. <code class="literal">DISTINCT</code></a></dt> </dl> </div> <p>As shown in the previous section, the table expression in the <code class="command">SELECT</code> command constructs an intermediate virtual table by possibly combining tables, views, eliminating rows, grouping, etc. This table is finally passed on to processing by the <em class="firstterm">select list</em>. The select list determines which <span class="emphasis"><em>columns</em></span> of the intermediate table are actually output.</p> <div class="sect2" id="id-1.5.6.7.4.2">    <h2 class="title">7.3.1. Select-List Items </h2>    <p>The simplest kind of select list is <code class="literal">*</code> which emits all columns that the table expression produces. Otherwise, a select list is a comma-separated list of value expressions (as defined in <a class="xref" href="sql-expressions.html" title="4.2. Value Expressions">Section 4.2</a>). For instance, it could be a list of column names:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT a, b, c FROM ...
</pre> <p>The columns names <code class="literal">a</code>, <code class="literal">b</code>, and <code class="literal">c</code> are either the actual names of the columns of tables referenced in the <code class="literal">FROM</code> clause, or the aliases given to them as explained in <a class="xref" href="queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-TABLE-ALIASES" title="7.2.1.2. Table and Column Aliases">Section 7.2.1.2</a>. The name space available in the select list is the same as in the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause, unless grouping is used, in which case it is the same as in the <code class="literal">HAVING</code> clause.</p> <p>If more than one table has a column of the same name, the table name must also be given, as in:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT tbl1.a, tbl2.a, tbl1.b FROM ...
</pre> <p>When working with multiple tables, it can also be useful to ask for all the columns of a particular table:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT tbl1.*, tbl2.a FROM ...
</pre> <p>See <a class="xref" href="rowtypes.html#ROWTYPES-USAGE" title="8.16.5. Using Composite Types in Queries">Section 8.16.5</a> for more about the <code>table_name</code><code class="literal">.*</code> notation.</p> <p>If an arbitrary value expression is used in the select list, it conceptually adds a new virtual column to the returned table. The value expression is evaluated once for each result row, with the row's values substituted for any column references. But the expressions in the select list do not have to reference any columns in the table expression of the <code class="literal">FROM</code> clause; they can be constant arithmetic expressions, for instance.</p> </div> <div class="sect2" id="id-1.5.6.7.5.2">    <h2 class="title">7.3.2. Column Labels </h2>    <p>The entries in the select list can be assigned names for subsequent processing, such as for use in an <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code> clause or for display by the client application. For example:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT a AS value, b + c AS sum FROM ...
</pre> <p>If no output column name is specified using <code class="literal">AS</code>, the system assigns a default column name. For simple column references, this is the name of the referenced column. For function calls, this is the name of the function. For complex expressions, the system will generate a generic name.</p> <p>The <code class="literal">AS</code> key word is usually optional, but in some cases where the desired column name matches a PostgreSQL key word, you must write <code class="literal">AS</code> or double-quote the column name in order to avoid ambiguity. (<a class="xref" href="sql-keywords-appendix.html" title="Appendix C. SQL Key Words">Appendix C</a> shows which key words require <code class="literal">AS</code> to be used as a column label.) For example, <code class="literal">FROM</code> is one such key word, so this does not work:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT a from, b + c AS sum FROM ...
</pre> <p>but either of these do:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT a AS from, b + c AS sum FROM ...
SELECT a "from", b + c AS sum FROM ...
</pre> <p>For greatest safety against possible future key word additions, it is recommended that you always either write <code class="literal">AS</code> or double-quote the output column name.</p> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>The naming of output columns here is different from that done in the <code class="literal">FROM</code> clause (see <a class="xref" href="queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-TABLE-ALIASES" title="7.2.1.2. Table and Column Aliases">Section 7.2.1.2</a>). It is possible to rename the same column twice, but the name assigned in the select list is the one that will be passed on.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="sect2" id="id-1.5.6.7.6.6">    <h2 class="title">7.3.3. <code class="literal">DISTINCT</code> </h2>    <p>After the select list has been processed, the result table can optionally be subject to the elimination of duplicate rows. The <code class="literal">DISTINCT</code> key word is written directly after <code class="literal">SELECT</code> to specify this:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT DISTINCT select_list ...
</pre> <p>(Instead of <code class="literal">DISTINCT</code> the key word <code class="literal">ALL</code> can be used to specify the default behavior of retaining all rows.)</p> <p>Obviously, two rows are considered distinct if they differ in at least one column value. Null values are considered equal in this comparison.</p> <p>Alternatively, an arbitrary expression can determine what rows are to be considered distinct:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT DISTINCT ON (expression [, expression ...]) select_list ...
</pre> <p>Here <code>expression</code> is an arbitrary value expression that is evaluated for all rows. A set of rows for which all the expressions are equal are considered duplicates, and only the first row of the set is kept in the output. Note that the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">first row</span>”</span> of a set is unpredictable unless the query is sorted on enough columns to guarantee a unique ordering of the rows arriving at the <code class="literal">DISTINCT</code> filter. (<code class="literal">DISTINCT ON</code> processing occurs after <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code> sorting.)</p> <p>The <code class="literal">DISTINCT ON</code> clause is not part of the SQL standard and is sometimes considered bad style because of the potentially indeterminate nature of its results. With judicious use of <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code> and subqueries in <code class="literal">FROM</code>, this construct can be avoided, but it is often the most convenient alternative.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
