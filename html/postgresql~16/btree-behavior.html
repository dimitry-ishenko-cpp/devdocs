<h1>67.2. Behavior of B-Tree Operator Classes </h1>    <p>As shown in <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/xindex.html#XINDEX-BTREE-STRAT-TABLE" title="Table 38.3. B-Tree Strategies">Table 38.3</a>, a btree operator class must provide five comparison operators, <code class="literal">&lt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;=</code>, <code class="literal">=</code>, <code class="literal">&gt;=</code> and <code class="literal">&gt;</code>. One might expect that <code class="literal">&lt;&gt;</code> should also be part of the operator class, but it is not, because it would almost never be useful to use a <code class="literal">&lt;&gt;</code> WHERE clause in an index search. (For some purposes, the planner treats <code class="literal">&lt;&gt;</code> as associated with a btree operator class; but it finds that operator via the <code class="literal">=</code> operator's negator link, rather than from <code class="structname">pg_amop</code>.)</p> <p>When several data types share near-identical sorting semantics, their operator classes can be grouped into an operator family. Doing so is advantageous because it allows the planner to make deductions about cross-type comparisons. Each operator class within the family should contain the single-type operators (and associated support functions) for its input data type, while cross-type comparison operators and support functions are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">loose</span>”</span> in the family. It is recommendable that a complete set of cross-type operators be included in the family, thus ensuring that the planner can represent any comparison conditions that it deduces from transitivity.</p> <p>There are some basic assumptions that a btree operator family must satisfy:</p>  <ul> <li> <p>An <code class="literal">=</code> operator must be an equivalence relation; that is, for all non-null values <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> of the data type:</p>  <ul> <li> <p><code>A</code> <code class="literal">=</code> <code>A</code> is true (<em class="firstterm">reflexive law</em>)</p> </li> <li> <p>if <code>A</code> <code class="literal">=</code> <code>B</code>, then <code>B</code> <code class="literal">=</code> <code>A</code> (<em class="firstterm">symmetric law</em>)</p> </li> <li> <p>if <code>A</code> <code class="literal">=</code> <code>B</code> and <code>B</code> <code class="literal">=</code> <code>C</code>, then <code>A</code> <code class="literal">=</code> <code>C</code> (<em class="firstterm">transitive law</em>)</p> </li> </ul>  </li> <li> <p>A <code class="literal">&lt;</code> operator must be a strong ordering relation; that is, for all non-null values <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>:</p>  <ul> <li> <p><code>A</code> <code class="literal">&lt;</code> <code>A</code> is false (<em class="firstterm">irreflexive law</em>)</p> </li> <li> <p>if <code>A</code> <code class="literal">&lt;</code> <code>B</code> and <code>B</code> <code class="literal">&lt;</code> <code>C</code>, then <code>A</code> <code class="literal">&lt;</code> <code>C</code> (<em class="firstterm">transitive law</em>)</p> </li> </ul>  </li> <li> <p>Furthermore, the ordering is total; that is, for all non-null values <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>:</p>  <ul> <li> <p>exactly one of <code>A</code> <code class="literal">&lt;</code> <code>B</code>, <code>A</code> <code class="literal">=</code> <code>B</code>, and <code>B</code> <code class="literal">&lt;</code> <code>A</code> is true (<em class="firstterm">trichotomy law</em>)</p> </li> </ul>  <p>(The trichotomy law justifies the definition of the comparison support function, of course.)</p> </li> </ul>  <p>The other three operators are defined in terms of <code class="literal">=</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;</code> in the obvious way, and must act consistently with them.</p> <p>For an operator family supporting multiple data types, the above laws must hold when <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> are taken from any data types in the family. The transitive laws are the trickiest to ensure, as in cross-type situations they represent statements that the behaviors of two or three different operators are consistent. As an example, it would not work to put <code class="type">float8</code> and <code class="type">numeric</code> into the same operator family, at least not with the current semantics that <code class="type">numeric</code> values are converted to <code class="type">float8</code> for comparison to a <code class="type">float8</code>. Because of the limited accuracy of <code class="type">float8</code>, this means there are distinct <code class="type">numeric</code> values that will compare equal to the same <code class="type">float8</code> value, and thus the transitive law would fail.</p> <p>Another requirement for a multiple-data-type family is that any implicit or binary-coercion casts that are defined between data types included in the operator family must not change the associated sort ordering.</p> <p>It should be fairly clear why a btree index requires these laws to hold within a single data type: without them there is no ordering to arrange the keys with. Also, index searches using a comparison key of a different data type require comparisons to behave sanely across two data types. The extensions to three or more data types within a family are not strictly required by the btree index mechanism itself, but the planner relies on them for optimization purposes.</p><div class="_attribution">
