<h1>74.1. Transactions and Identifiers </h1>    <p>Transactions can be created explicitly using <code class="command">BEGIN</code> or <code class="command">START TRANSACTION</code> and ended using <code class="command">COMMIT</code> or <code class="command">ROLLBACK</code>. SQL statements outside of explicit transactions automatically use single-statement transactions.</p> <p>Every transaction is identified by a unique <code class="literal">VirtualTransactionId</code> (also called <code class="literal">virtualXID</code> or <code class="literal">vxid</code>), which is comprised of a backend ID (or <code class="literal">backendID</code>) and a sequentially-assigned number local to each backend, known as <code class="literal">localXID</code>. For example, the virtual transaction ID <code class="literal">4/12532</code> has a <code class="literal">backendID</code> of <code class="literal">4</code> and a <code class="literal">localXID</code> of <code class="literal">12532</code>.</p> <p>Non-virtual <code class="literal">TransactionId</code>s (or <code class="type">xid</code>), e.g., <code class="literal">278394</code>, are assigned sequentially to transactions from a global counter used by all databases within the PostgreSQL cluster. This assignment happens when a transaction first writes to the database. This means lower-numbered xids started writing before higher-numbered xids. Note that the order in which transactions perform their first database write might be different from the order in which the transactions started, particularly if the transaction started with statements that only performed database reads.</p> <p>The internal transaction ID type <code class="type">xid</code> is 32 bits wide and <a class="link" href="routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-WRAPAROUND" title="25.1.5. Preventing Transaction ID Wraparound Failures">wraps around</a> every 4 billion transactions. A 32-bit epoch is incremented during each wraparound. There is also a 64-bit type <code class="type">xid8</code> which includes this epoch and therefore does not wrap around during the life of an installation; it can be converted to xid by casting. The functions in <a class="xref" href="functions-info.html#FUNCTIONS-PG-SNAPSHOT" title="Table 9.80. Transaction ID and Snapshot Information Functions">Table 9.80</a> return <code class="type">xid8</code> values. Xids are used as the basis for PostgreSQL's <a class="link" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/mvcc.html" title="Chapter 13. Concurrency Control">MVCC</a> concurrency mechanism and streaming replication.</p> <p>When a top-level transaction with a (non-virtual) xid commits, it is marked as committed in the <code class="filename">pg_xact</code> directory. Additional information is recorded in the <code class="filename">pg_commit_ts</code> directory if <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-TRACK-COMMIT-TIMESTAMP">track_commit_timestamp</a> is enabled.</p> <p>In addition to <code class="literal">vxid</code> and <code class="type">xid</code>, prepared transactions are also assigned Global Transaction Identifiers (GID). GIDs are string literals up to 200 bytes long, which must be unique amongst other currently prepared transactions. The mapping of GID to xid is shown in <a class="link" href="view-pg-prepared-xacts.html" title="54.16. pg_prepared_xacts"><code class="structname">pg_prepared_xacts</code></a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
