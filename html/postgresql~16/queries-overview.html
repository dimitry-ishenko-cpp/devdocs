<h1>7.1. Overview </h1>    <p>The process of retrieving or the command to retrieve data from a database is called a <em class="firstterm">query</em>. In SQL the <a class="link" href="sql-select.html" title="SELECT"><code class="command">SELECT</code></a> command is used to specify queries. The general syntax of the <code class="command">SELECT</code> command is</p> <pre data-language="sql">
[WITH with_queries] SELECT select_list FROM table_expression [sort_specification]
</pre> <p>The following sections describe the details of the select list, the table expression, and the sort specification. <code class="literal">WITH</code> queries are treated last since they are an advanced feature.</p> <p>A simple kind of query has the form:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT * FROM table1;
</pre> <p>Assuming that there is a table called <code class="literal">table1</code>, this command would retrieve all rows and all user-defined columns from <code class="literal">table1</code>. (The method of retrieval depends on the client application. For example, the psql program will display an ASCII-art table on the screen, while client libraries will offer functions to extract individual values from the query result.) The select list specification <code class="literal">*</code> means all columns that the table expression happens to provide. A select list can also select a subset of the available columns or make calculations using the columns. For example, if <code class="literal">table1</code> has columns named <code class="literal">a</code>, <code class="literal">b</code>, and <code class="literal">c</code> (and perhaps others) you can make the following query:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT a, b + c FROM table1;
</pre> <p>(assuming that <code class="literal">b</code> and <code class="literal">c</code> are of a numerical data type). See <a class="xref" href="queries-select-lists.html" title="7.3.Â Select Lists">Section 7.3</a> for more details.</p> <p><code class="literal">FROM table1</code> is a simple kind of table expression: it reads just one table. In general, table expressions can be complex constructs of base tables, joins, and subqueries. But you can also omit the table expression entirely and use the <code class="command">SELECT</code> command as a calculator:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT 3 * 4;
</pre> <p>This is more useful if the expressions in the select list return varying results. For example, you could call a function this way:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT random();
