<h1>11.3. Multicolumn Indexes </h1>    <p>An index can be defined on more than one column of a table. For example, if you have a table of this form:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE TABLE test2 (
  major int,
  minor int,
  name varchar
);
</pre> <p>(say, you keep your <code class="filename">/dev</code> directory in a database...) and you frequently issue queries like:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT name FROM test2 WHERE major = constant AND minor = constant;
</pre> <p>then it might be appropriate to define an index on the columns <code class="structfield">major</code> and <code class="structfield">minor</code> together, e.g.:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE INDEX test2_mm_idx ON test2 (major, minor);
</pre> <p>Currently, only the B-tree, GiST, GIN, and BRIN index types support multiple-key-column indexes. Whether there can be multiple key columns is independent of whether <code class="literal">INCLUDE</code> columns can be added to the index. Indexes can have up to 32 columns, including <code class="literal">INCLUDE</code> columns. (This limit can be altered when building PostgreSQL; see the file <code class="filename">pg_config_manual.h</code>.)</p> <p>A multicolumn B-tree index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index's columns, but the index is most efficient when there are constraints on the leading (leftmost) columns. The exact rule is that equality constraints on leading columns, plus any inequality constraints on the first column that does not have an equality constraint, will be used to limit the portion of the index that is scanned. Constraints on columns to the right of these columns are checked in the index, so they save visits to the table proper, but they do not reduce the portion of the index that has to be scanned. For example, given an index on <code class="literal">(a, b, c)</code> and a query condition <code class="literal">WHERE a = 5 AND b &gt;= 42 AND c &lt; 77</code>, the index would have to be scanned from the first entry with <code class="literal">a</code> = 5 and <code class="literal">b</code> = 42 up through the last entry with <code class="literal">a</code> = 5. Index entries with <code class="literal">c</code> &gt;= 77 would be skipped, but they'd still have to be scanned through. This index could in principle be used for queries that have constraints on <code class="literal">b</code> and/or <code class="literal">c</code> with no constraint on <code class="literal">a</code> — but the entire index would have to be scanned, so in most cases the planner would prefer a sequential table scan over using the index.</p> <p>A multicolumn GiST index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index's columns. Conditions on additional columns restrict the entries returned by the index, but the condition on the first column is the most important one for determining how much of the index needs to be scanned. A GiST index will be relatively ineffective if its first column has only a few distinct values, even if there are many distinct values in additional columns.</p> <p>A multicolumn GIN index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index's columns. Unlike B-tree or GiST, index search effectiveness is the same regardless of which index column(s) the query conditions use.</p> <p>A multicolumn BRIN index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index's columns. Like GIN and unlike B-tree or GiST, index search effectiveness is the same regardless of which index column(s) the query conditions use. The only reason to have multiple BRIN indexes instead of one multicolumn BRIN index on a single table is to have a different <code class="literal">pages_per_range</code> storage parameter.</p> <p>Of course, each column must be used with operators appropriate to the index type; clauses that involve other operators will not be considered.</p> <p>Multicolumn indexes should be used sparingly. In most situations, an index on a single column is sufficient and saves space and time. Indexes with more than three columns are unlikely to be helpful unless the usage of the table is extremely stylized.
