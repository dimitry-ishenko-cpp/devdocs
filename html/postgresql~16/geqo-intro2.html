<h1>62.2. Genetic Algorithms </h1>    <p>The genetic algorithm (GA) is a heuristic optimization method which operates through randomized search. The set of possible solutions for the optimization problem is considered as a <em class="firstterm">population</em> of <em class="firstterm">individuals</em>. The degree of adaptation of an individual to its environment is specified by its <em class="firstterm">fitness</em>.</p> <p>The coordinates of an individual in the search space are represented by <em class="firstterm">chromosomes</em>, in essence a set of character strings. A <em class="firstterm">gene</em> is a subsection of a chromosome which encodes the value of a single parameter being optimized. Typical encodings for a gene could be <em class="firstterm">binary</em> or <em class="firstterm">integer</em>.</p> <p>Through simulation of the evolutionary operations <em class="firstterm">recombination</em>, <em class="firstterm">mutation</em>, and <em class="firstterm">selection</em> new generations of search points are found that show a higher average fitness than their ancestors. <a class="xref" href="geqo-intro2.html#GEQO-FIGURE" title="Figure 62.1. Structure of a Genetic Algorithm">Figure 62.1</a> illustrates these steps.</p> <div class="figure col-xl-8 col-lg-10 col-md-12" id="GEQO-FIGURE"> <p class="title"><strong>Figure 62.1. Structure of a Genetic Algorithm</strong></p>  </div> <p>According to the <span class="systemitem">comp.ai.genetic</span> FAQ it cannot be stressed too strongly that a GA is not a pure random search for a solution to a problem. A GA uses stochastic processes, but the result is distinctly non-random (better than random).</p><div class="_attribution">
