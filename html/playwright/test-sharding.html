</h2> <p>By default, Playwright runs tests in <a href="test-parallel.html">parallel</a> and strives for optimal utilization of CPU cores on your machine. In order to achieve even greater parallelisation, you can further scale Playwright test execution by running tests on multiple machines simultaneously. We call this mode of operation "sharding".</p> <h2 id="sharding-tests-between-multiple-machines">Sharding tests between multiple machines<a href="#sharding-tests-between-multiple-machines" aria-label="Direct link to Sharding tests between multiple machines" title="Direct link to Sharding tests between multiple machines">​</a>
</h2> <p>To shard the test suite, pass <code>--shard=x/y</code> to the command line. For example, to split the suite into four shards, each running one fourth of the tests:</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test --shard=1/4
npx playwright test --shard=2/4
npx playwright test --shard=3/4
npx playwright test --shard=4/4</pre> <p>Now, if you run these shards in parallel on different computers, your test suite completes four times faster.</p> <h2 id="merging-reports-from-multiple-shards">Merging reports from multiple shards<a href="#merging-reports-from-multiple-shards" aria-label="Direct link to Merging reports from multiple shards" title="Direct link to Merging reports from multiple shards">​</a>
</h2> <p>In the previous example, each test shard has its own test report. If you want to have a combined report showing all the test results from all the shards, you can merge them.</p> <p>Start with adding <code>blob</code> reporter to the config when running on CI:</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  reporter: process.env.CI ? 'blob' : 'html',
});</pre> <p>Blob report contains information about all the tests that were run and their results as well as all test attachments such as traces and screenshot diffs. Blob reports can be merged and converted to any other Playwright report. By default, blob report will be generated into <code>blob-report</code> directory.</p> <p>To merge reports from multiple shards, put the blob report files into a single directory, for example <code>all-blob-reports</code>. Blob report names contain shard number, so they will not clash.</p> <p>Afterwards, run <code>npx playwright merge-reports</code> command:</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright merge-reports --reporter html ./all-blob-reports</pre> <p>This will produce a standard HTML report into <code>playwright-report</code> directory.</p> <h2 id="github-actions-example">GitHub Actions example<a href="#github-actions-example" aria-label="Direct link to GitHub Actions example" title="Direct link to GitHub Actions example">​</a>
</h2> <p>GitHub Actions supports <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharding tests between multiple jobs</a> using the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>jobs.&lt;job_id&gt;.strategy.matrix</code></a> option. The <code>matrix</code> option will run a separate job for every possible combination of the provided options.</p> <p>The following example shows you how to configure a job to run your tests on four machines in parallel and then merge the reports into a single report. Don't forget to add <code>reporter: process.env.CI ? 'blob' : 'html',</code> to your <code>playwright.config.ts</code> file as in the example above.</p> <ol> <li>First we add a <code>matrix</code> option to our job configuration with the <code>shardTotal: [4]</code> option containing the total number of shards we want to create and <code>shardIndex: [1, 2, 3, 4]</code> with an array of the shard numbers.</li> <li>Then we run our Playwright tests with the <code>--shard=${{ matrix.shardIndex }}/${{ matrix.shardTotal }}</code> option. This will run our test command for each shard.</li> <li>Finally we upload our blob report to the GitHub Actions Artifacts. This will make the blob report available to other jobs in the workflow.</li> </ol> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">name: Playwright Tests

</h2> <p><code>npx playwright merge-reports path/to/blob-reports-dir</code> reads all blob reports from the passed directory and merges them into a single report.</p> <p>When merging reports from different OS'es you'll have to provide an explicit merge config to disambiguate which directory should be used as tests root.</p> <p>Supported options:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>--reporter reporter-to-use</code></p> <p>Which report to produce.
