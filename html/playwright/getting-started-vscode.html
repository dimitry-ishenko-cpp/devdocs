</h2> <p>CodeGen will auto generate your tests for you as you perform actions in the browser and is a great way to quickly get started. The viewport for the browser window is set to a specific width and height. See the <a href="test-configuration.html">configuration guide</a> to change the viewport or emulate different environments.</p>  <h3 id="record-a-new-test">Record a new test<a href="#record-a-new-test" aria-label="Direct link to Record a new test" title="Direct link to Record a new test">​</a>
</h3> <p>To record a test click on the <strong>Record new</strong> button from the Testing sidebar. This will create a <code>test-1.spec.ts</code> file as well as open up a browser window. In the browser go to the URL you wish to test and start clicking around. Playwright will record your actions and generate the test code directly in VS Code. You can also generate assertions by choosing one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. The following assertions can be generated:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>'assert visibility'</code> to assert that an element is visible</li> <li>
<code>'assert text'</code> to assert that an element contains specific text</li> <li>
<code>'assert value'</code> to assert that an element has a specific value</li> </ul> <p>Once you are done recording click the <strong>cancel</strong> button or close the browser window. You can then inspect your <code>test-1.spec.ts</code> file and see your generated test.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/0407f112-e1cd-41e7-a05d-ae64e24d27ed" alt="record a new test"></p> <h3 id="record-at-cursor">Record at cursor<a href="#record-at-cursor" aria-label="Direct link to Record at cursor" title="Direct link to Record at cursor">​</a>
</h3> <p>To record from a specific point in your test file click the <strong>Record at cursor</strong> button from the Testing sidebar. This generates actions into the existing test at the current cursor position. You can run the test, position the cursor at the end of the test and continue generating the test.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/96933ea1-4c84-453a-acd7-22b4d3bde185" alt="record at cursor"></p> <h3 id="picking-a-locator">Picking a locator<a href="#picking-a-locator" aria-label="Direct link to Picking a locator" title="Direct link to Picking a locator">​</a>
</h3> <p>Pick a <a href="locators.html">locator</a> and copy it into your test file by clicking the <strong>Pick locator</strong> button form the testing sidebar. Then in the browser click the element you require and it will now show up in the <strong>Pick locator</strong> box in VS Code. Press 'enter' on your keyboard to copy the locator into the clipboard and then paste anywhere in your code. Or press 'escape' if you want to cancel.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/9a1b2da9-9ac7-4def-a9e0-f94770364fc2" alt="pick locators"></p> <p>Playwright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing <a href="locators.html">role, text and test id locators</a>. If the generator finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, so you don't have to worry about failing tests due to locators.</p> <h2 id="project-dependencies">Project Dependencies<a href="#project-dependencies" aria-label="Direct link to Project Dependencies" title="Direct link to Project Dependencies">​</a>
</h2> <p>You can use <a href="test-projects.html">project dependencies</a> to run tests that depend on other tests. This is useful for <strong>setup</strong> tests such as logging in to a website.</p> <h3 id="running-setup-tests">Running setup tests<a href="#running-setup-tests" aria-label="Direct link to Running setup tests" title="Direct link to Running setup tests">​</a>
</h3> <p>To run your setup tests select the <strong>setup</strong> project, as defined in your configuration file, from the project section in the Playwright sidebar. This will give you access to the <strong>setup</strong> tests in the test explorer.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/7a9eccd5-a5b3-431f-9eff-9b2971501e07" alt="setup tests in vscode"></p> <p>When you run a test that depends on the <strong>setup</strong> tests, the <strong>setup</strong> test will run first.

</h3> <p>To run the <strong>setup</strong> test only once, deselect it from the projects section in the Playwright sidebar. The <strong>setup</strong> test is now removed from the test explorer. When you run a test that depends on the <strong>setup</strong> test, it will no longer run the <strong>setup</strong> test, making it much faster and therefore a much better developer experience.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/ebc50e38-c98d-4538-82fe-ec08491f8487" alt="deselecting setup tests in vscode"></p> <h2 id="global-setup">Global Setup<a href="#global-setup" aria-label="Direct link to Global Setup" title="Direct link to Global Setup">​</a>
</h2> <p><strong>Global setup</strong> tests are run when you execute your first test. This runs only once and is useful for setting up a database or starting a server. You can manually run a <strong>global setup</strong> test by clicking the <code>Run global setup</code> option from the <strong>Setup</strong> section in the Playwright sidebar. You can also run <strong>global teardown</strong> tests by clicking the <code>Run global teardown</code> option.</p> <p>Global setup will re-run when you debug tests as this ensures an isolated environment and dedicated setup for the test.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/bcf5fec7-2d7d-4cb9-a277-5f41e19b8d52" alt="running global setup"></p> <h2 id="multiple-configurations">Multiple configurations<a href="#multiple-configurations" aria-label="Direct link to Multiple configurations" title="Direct link to Multiple configurations">​</a>
