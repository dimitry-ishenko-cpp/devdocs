</h2> <p>Playwright Test was created specifically to accommodate the needs of end-to-end testing. Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed with native mobile emulation of Google Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari.</p> <p>Get started by installing Playwright and generating a test to see it in action. Alternatively you can also get started and run your tests using the <a href="index.html">CLI</a>.</p>  <h2 id="installation">Installation<a href="#installation" aria-label="Direct link to Installation" title="Direct link to Installation">​</a>

</h2> <p>You can run a single test by clicking the green triangle next to your test block to run your test. Playwright will run through each line of the test and when it finishes you will see a green tick next to your test block as well as the time it took to run the test.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/69dbccfc-4e9f-40e7-bcdf-7d5c5a11f988" alt="run a single test"></p> <h3 id="run-tests-and-show-browsers">Run Tests and Show Browsers<a href="#run-tests-and-show-browsers" aria-label="Direct link to Run Tests and Show Browsers" title="Direct link to Run Tests and Show Browsers">​</a>

Then when you click the green triangle to run your test the browser will open and you will visually see it run through your test. Leave this selected if you want browsers open for all your tests or uncheck it if you prefer your tests to run in headless mode with no browser open.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/9f231530-0c43-466a-b944-8cf5102f714a" alt="show browsers while running tests"></p> <p>Use the <strong>Close all browsers</strong> button to close all browsers.</p> <h3 id="view-and-run-all-tests">View and Run All Tests<a href="#view-and-run-all-tests" aria-label="Direct link to View and Run All Tests" title="Direct link to View and Run All Tests">​</a>

</h2> <p>CodeGen will auto generate your tests for you as you perform actions in the browser and is a great way to quickly get started. The viewport for the browser window is set to a specific width and height. See the <a href="test-configuration.html">configuration guide</a> to change the viewport or emulate different environments.</p>  <h3 id="record-a-new-test">Record a New Test<a href="#record-a-new-test" aria-label="Direct link to Record a New Test" title="Direct link to Record a New Test">​</a>
</h3> <p>To record a test click on the <strong>Record new</strong> button from the Testing sidebar. This will create a <code>test-1.spec.ts</code> file as well as open up a browser window. In the browser go to the URL you wish to test and start clicking around. Playwright will record your actions and generate the test code directly in VS Code. You can also generate assertions by choosing one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. The following assertions can be generated:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>'assert visibility'</code> to assert that an element is visible</li> <li>
<code>'assert text'</code> to assert that an element contains specific text</li> <li>
<code>'assert value'</code> to assert that an element has a specific value</li> </ul> <p>Once you are done recording click the <strong>cancel</strong> button or close the browser window. You can then inspect your <code>test-1.spec.ts</code> file and see your generated test.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/0407f112-e1cd-41e7-a05d-ae64e24d27ed" alt="record a new test"></p> <h3 id="record-at-cursor">Record at Cursor<a href="#record-at-cursor" aria-label="Direct link to Record at Cursor" title="Direct link to Record at Cursor">​</a>
</h3> <p>To record from a specific point in your test file click the <strong>Record at cursor</strong> button from the Testing sidebar. This generates actions into the existing test at the current cursor position. You can run the test, position the cursor at the end of the test and continue generating the test.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/96933ea1-4c84-453a-acd7-22b4d3bde185" alt="record at cursor"></p> <h3 id="picking-a-locator">Picking a Locator<a href="#picking-a-locator" aria-label="Direct link to Picking a Locator" title="Direct link to Picking a Locator">​</a>
</h3> <p>Pick a <a href="locators.html">locator</a> and copy it into your test file by clicking the <strong>Pick locator</strong> button form the testing sidebar. Then in the browser click the element you require and it will now show up in the <strong>Pick locator</strong> box in VS Code. Press 'enter' on your keyboard to copy the locator into the clipboard and then paste anywhere in your code. Or press 'escape' if you want to cancel.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/9a1b2da9-9ac7-4def-a9e0-f94770364fc2" alt="pick locators"></p> <p>Playwright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing <a href="locators.html">role, text and test id locators</a>. If the generator finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, so you don't have to worry about failing tests due to locators.</p> <h2 id="whats-next">What's next<a href="#whats-next" aria-label="Direct link to What's next" title="Direct link to What's next">​</a>
