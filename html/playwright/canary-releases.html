</h2> <p>Playwright for Node.js has a canary releases system.</p> <p>It permits you to <strong>test new unreleased features</strong> instead of waiting for a full release. They get released daily on the <code>next</code> NPM tag of Playwright.</p> <p>It is a good way to <strong>give feedback to maintainers</strong>, ensuring the newly implemented feature works as intended.</p> <blockquote>

note</div>
<div><p>Using a canary release in production might seem risky, but in practice, it's not. A canary release passes all automated tests and is used to test e.g. the HTML report, Trace Viewer, or Playwright Inspector with end-to-end tests.</p></div>
