</h2> <p>Playwright tests can be executed in CI environments. We have created sample configurations for common CI providers.</p> <p>3 steps to get your tests running on CI:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Ensure CI agent can run browsers</strong>: Use <a href="docker.html">our Docker image</a> in Linux agents or install your dependencies using the <a href="browsers.html#install-system-dependencies">CLI</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Install Playwright</strong>:</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"># Install NPM packages

</h2> <p>We recommend setting <a href="api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-workers">workers</a> to "1" in CI environments to prioritize stability and reproducibility. Running tests sequentially ensures each test gets the full system resources, avoiding potential conflicts. However, if you have a powerful self-hosted CI system, you may enable <a href="test-parallel.html">parallel</a> tests. For wider parallelization, consider <a href="test-parallel.html#shard-tests-between-multiple-machines">sharding</a> - distributing tests across multiple CI jobs.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

</h4> <p>Large test suites can take very long to execute. By executing a preliminary test run with the <code>--only-changed</code> flag, you can run test files that are likely to fail first. This will give you a faster feedback loop and slightly lower CI consumption while working on Pull Requests. To detect test files affected by your changeset, <code>--only-changed</code> analyses your suites' dependency graph. This is a heuristic and might miss tests, so it's important that you always run the full test suite after the preliminary test run.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">name: Playwright Tests

The default behavior of Playwright is to set the number of workers to the detected core count (2 in the case of the medium tier).
