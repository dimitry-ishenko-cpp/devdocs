</h2> <p>With Playwright you can run a single test, a set of tests or all tests. Tests can be run on one browser or multiple browsers by using the <code>--project</code> flag. Tests are run in parallel by default and are run in a headless manner, meaning no browser window will be opened while running the tests and results will be seen in the terminal. However, you can run tests in headed mode by using the <code>--headed</code> CLI argument, or you can run your tests in <a href="test-ui-mode.html">UI mode</a> by using the <code>--ui</code> flag. See a full trace of your tests complete with watch mode, time travel debugging and more.</p> <p><strong>You will learn</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="running-tests.html#command-line">How to run tests from the command line</a></li> <li><a href="running-tests.html#debugging-tests">How to debug tests</a></li> <li><a href="running-tests.html#test-reports">How to open the HTML test reporter</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="running-tests">Running tests<a href="#running-tests" aria-label="Direct link to Running tests" title="Direct link to Running tests">​</a>

</h3> <p>You can run your tests with the <code>playwright test</code> command. This will run your tests on all browsers as configured in the <code>playwright.config</code> file. Tests run in headless mode by default meaning no browser window will be opened while running the tests and results will be seen in the terminal.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test</pre> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/981c1b2b-dc7e-4b85-b241-272b44da6628" alt="tests running in command line"></p> <h3 id="run-tests-in-ui-mode">Run tests in UI mode<a href="#run-tests-in-ui-mode" aria-label="Direct link to Run tests in UI mode" title="Direct link to Run tests in UI mode">​</a>

Once installed you can simply click the green triangle next to the test you want to run or run all tests from the testing sidebar.

</h2> <p>Since Playwright runs in Node.js, you can debug it with your debugger of choice e.g. using <code>console.log</code> or inside your IDE or directly in VS Code with the <a href="getting-started-vscode.html">VS Code Extension</a>. Playwright comes with <a href="test-ui-mode.html">UI Mode</a>, where you can easily walk through each step of the test, see logs, errors, network requests, inspect the DOM snapshot and more. You can also use the <a href="debug.html#playwright-inspector">Playwright Inspector</a>, which allows you to step through Playwright API calls, see their debug logs and explore <a href="locators.html">locators</a>.</p> <h3 id="debug-tests-in-ui-mode">Debug tests in UI mode<a href="#debug-tests-in-ui-mode" aria-label="Direct link to Debug tests in UI mode" title="Direct link to Debug tests in UI mode">​</a>

You can use the step over button at the top of the inspector to step through your test. Or, press the play button to run your test from start to finish. Once the test has finished, the browser window will close.</p> <p>To debug one test file, run the Playwright test command with the name of the test file that you want to debug followed by the <code>--debug</code> flag.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test example.spec.ts --debug</pre> <p>To debug a specific test from the line number where the <code>test(..</code> is defined, add a colon followed by the line number at the end of the test file name, followed by the <code>--debug</code> flag.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test example.spec.ts:10 --debug</pre> <p>While debugging you can use the Pick Locator button to select an element on the page and see the locator that Playwright would use to find that element.
