</h2> <p>Playwright tests can be run on any CI provider. In this section we will cover running tests on GitHub using GitHub actions. If you would like to see how to configure other CI providers check out our detailed <a href="ci.html">doc on Continuous Integration</a>.</p> <p>When <a href="index.html">installing Playwright</a> using the <a href="getting-started-vscode.html">VS Code extension</a> or with <code>npm init playwright@latest</code> you are given the option to add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions</a> workflow. This creates a <code>playwright.yml</code> file inside a <code>.github/workflows</code> folder containing everything you need so that your tests run on each push and pull request into the main/master branch.</p> <h4 id="you-will-learn">You will learn<a href="#you-will-learn" aria-label="Direct link to You will learn" title="Direct link to You will learn">​</a>
