</h3> <p>Automated tests should verify that the application code works for the end users, and avoid relying on implementation details such as things which users will not typically use, see, or even know about such as the name of a function, whether something is an array, or the CSS class of some element. The end user will see or interact with what is rendered on the page, so your test should typically only see/interact with the same rendered output.</p> <h3 id="make-tests-as-isolated-as-possible">Make tests as isolated as possible<a href="#make-tests-as-isolated-as-possible" aria-label="Direct link to Make tests as isolated as possible" title="Direct link to Make tests as isolated as possible">‚Äã</a>
</h3> <p>Each test should be completely isolated from another test and should run independently with its own local storage, session storage, data, cookies etc. <a href="browser-contexts.html">Test isolation</a> improves reproducibility, makes debugging easier and prevents cascading test failures.</p> <p>In order to avoid repetition for a particular part of your test you can use <a href="api/class-test.html">before and after hooks</a>. Within your test file add a before hook to run a part of your test before each test such as going to a particular URL or logging in to a part of your app. This keeps your tests isolated as no test relies on another. However it is also ok to have a little duplication when tests are simple enough especially if it keeps your tests clearer and easier to read and maintain.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  // Runs before each test and signs in each page.
  await page.goto('https://github.com/login');
  await page.getByLabel('Username or email address').fill('username');
  await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();
});

test('first', async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  // page is signed in.
});

test('second', async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  // page is signed in.
});</pre> <p>You can also reuse the signed-in state in the tests with <a href="auth.html#basic-shared-account-in-all-tests">setup project</a>. That way you can log in only once and then skip the log in step for all of the tests.</p> <h3 id="avoid-testing-third-party-dependencies">Avoid testing third-party dependencies<a href="#avoid-testing-third-party-dependencies" aria-label="Direct link to Avoid testing third-party dependencies" title="Direct link to Avoid testing third-party dependencies">‚Äã</a>
</h3> <p>Only test what you control. Don't try to test links to external sites or third party servers that you do not control. Not only is it time consuming and can slow down your tests but also you can not control the content of the page you are linking to, or if there are cookie banners or overlay pages or anything else that might cause your test to fail.</p> <p>Instead, use the <a href="network.html#handle-requests">Playwright Network API</a> and guarantee the response needed.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">await page.route('**/api/fetch_data_third_party_dependency', route =&gt; route.fulfill({

</h3> <p>If working with a database then make sure you control the data. Test against a staging environment and make sure it doesn't change. For visual regression tests make sure the operating system and browser versions are the same.</p> <h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices<a href="#best-practices" aria-label="Direct link to Best Practices" title="Direct link to Best Practices">‚Äã</a>
</h2> <h3 id="use-locators">Use locators<a href="#use-locators" aria-label="Direct link to Use locators" title="Direct link to Use locators">‚Äã</a>
</h3> <p>In order to write end to end tests we need to first find elements on the webpage. We can do this by using Playwright's built in <a href="locators.html">locators</a>. Locators come with auto waiting and retry-ability. Auto waiting means that Playwright performs a range of actionability checks on the elements, such as ensuring the element is visible and enabled before it performs the click. To make tests resilient, we recommend prioritizing user-facing attributes and explicit contracts.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">// üëç

</h4> <p>Locators can be <a href="locators.html#matching-inside-a-locator">chained</a> to narrow down the search to a particular part of the page.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">const product = page.getByRole('listitem').filter({ hasText: 'Product 2' });</pre> <p>You can also <a href="locators.html#filtering-locators">filter locators</a> by text or by another locator.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">await page
    .getByRole('listitem')
    .filter({ hasText: 'Product 2' })

</h4> <p>Your DOM can easily change so having your tests depend on your DOM structure can lead to failing tests. For example consider selecting this button by its CSS classes. Should the designer change something then the class might change breaking your test.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">// üëé
page.locator('button.buttonIcon.episode-actions-later');</pre> <p>Use locators that are resilient to changes in the DOM.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">// üëç

</h3> <p>Playwright has a <a href="codegen.html">test generator</a> that can generate tests and pick locators for you. It will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing role, text and test id locators. If the generator finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, so you don't have to worry about failing tests due to locators.</p> <h4 id="use-codegen-to-generate-locators">Use <code>codegen</code> to generate locators<a href="#use-codegen-to-generate-locators" aria-label="Direct link to use-codegen-to-generate-locators" title="Direct link to use-codegen-to-generate-locators">‚Äã</a>
</h4> <p>To pick a locator run the <code>codegen</code> command followed by the URL that you would like to pick a locator from.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright codegen playwright.dev</pre> <p>This will open a new browser window as well as the Playwright inspector. To pick a locator first click on the 'Record' button to stop the recording. By default when you run the <code>codegen</code> command it will start a new recording. Once you stop the recording the 'Pick Locator' button will be available to click.</p> <p>You can then hover over any element on your page in the browser window and see the locator highlighted below your cursor. Clicking on an element will add the locator into the Playwright inspector. You can either copy the locator and paste into your test file or continue to explore the locator by editing it in the Playwright Inspector, for example by modifying the text, and seeing the results in the browser window.</p> <img width="1394" alt="generating locators with codegen" loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/212103268-e7d8ee8b-d307-4cba-be13-831f3fbb1f40.png"> <h4 id="use-the-vs-code-extension-to-generate-locators">Use the VS Code extension to generate locators<a href="#use-the-vs-code-extension-to-generate-locators" aria-label="Direct link to Use the VS Code extension to generate locators" title="Direct link to Use the VS Code extension to generate locators">‚Äã</a>
</h4> <p>You can also use the <a href="getting-started-vscode.html">VS Code Extension</a> to generate locators as well as record a test. The VS Code extension also gives you a great developer experience when writing, running, and debugging tests.</p> <img width="1394" alt="generating locators in vs code with codegen" loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/212269873-aca04043-16ce-4627-906f-7351d09740ab.png"> <h3 id="use-web-first-assertions">Use web first assertions<a href="#use-web-first-assertions" aria-label="Direct link to Use web first assertions" title="Direct link to Use web first assertions">‚Äã</a>
</h3> <p>Assertions are a way to verify that the expected result and the actual result matched or not. By using <a href="test-assertions.html">web first assertions</a> Playwright will wait until the expected condition is met. For example, when testing an alert message, a test would click a button that makes a message appear and check that the alert message is there. If the alert message takes half a second to appear, assertions such as <code>toBeVisible()</code> will wait and retry if needed.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">// üëç

</h4> <p>Don't use manual assertions that are not awaiting the expect. In the code below the await is inside the expect rather than before it. When using assertions such as <code>isVisible()</code> the test won't wait a single second, it will just check the locator is there and return immediately.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">// üëé

</h4> <p>For local debugging we recommend you <a href="getting-started-vscode.html#live-debugging">debug your tests live in VSCode.</a> by installing the <a href="getting-started-vscode.html">VS Code extension</a>. You can run tests in debug mode by right clicking on the line next to the test you want to run which will open a browser window and pause at where the breakpoint is set.</p> <img width="1338" alt="debugging tests in vscode" loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/212274675-5c6e1647-2aab-40fd-9804-8680c1ac2d16.png"> <p>You can live debug your test by clicking or editing the locators in your test in VS Code which will highlight this locator in the browser window as well as show you any other matching locators found on the page.</p> <img width="1394" alt="live debugging locators in vscode" loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/212273189-da271dc4-0f59-4138-92a8-10e719066cbe.png"> <p>You can also debug your tests with the Playwright inspector by running your tests with the <code>--debug</code> flag.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test --debug</pre> <p>You can then step through your test, view actionability logs and edit the locator live and see it highlighted in the browser window.

</h4> <p>For CI failures, use the Playwright <a href="trace-viewer.html">trace viewer</a> instead of videos and screenshots. The trace viewer gives you a full trace of your tests as a local Progressive Web App (PWA) that can easily be shared. With the trace viewer you can view the timeline, inspect DOM snapshots for each action using dev tools, view network requests and more.</p> <img width="1516" alt="playwrights trace viewer" loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/212277895-c63d94c2-bd06-4881-864e-62790a072ca3.png"> <p>Traces are configured in the Playwright config file and are set to run on CI on the first retry of a failed test. We don't recommend setting this to <code>on</code> so that traces are run on every test as it's very performance heavy. However you can run a trace locally when developing with the <code>--trace</code> flag.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test --trace on</pre> <p>Once you run this command your traces will be recorded for each test and can be viewed directly from the HTML report.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright show-report</pre> <img width="1516" alt="Playwrights HTML report" loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/212279022-d929d4c0-2271-486a-a75f-166ac231d25f.png"> <p>Traces can be opened by clicking on the icon next to the test or by opening each of the test reports and scrolling down to the traces section.</p> <img width="1516" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-13 at 09 58 34" loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/212279699-c9eb134f-4f4e-4f19-805c-37596d3272a6.png"> <h3 id="use-playwrights-tooling">Use Playwright's Tooling<a href="#use-playwrights-tooling" aria-label="Direct link to Use Playwright's Tooling" title="Direct link to Use Playwright's Tooling">‚Äã</a>
