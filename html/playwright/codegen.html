</h2> <p>Playwright comes with the ability to generate tests for you as you perform actions in the browser and is a great way to quickly get started with testing. Playwright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing <a href="locators.html">role, text and test id locators</a>. If the generator finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient that uniquely identify the target element.</p> <h2 id="generate-tests-in-vs-code">Generate tests in VS Code<a href="#generate-tests-in-vs-code" aria-label="Direct link to Generate tests in VS Code" title="Direct link to Generate tests in VS Code">​</a>
</h2> <p>Install the VS Code extension and generate tests directly from VS Code. The extension is available on the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code Marketplace</a>. Check out our guide on <a href="getting-started-vscode.html">getting started with VS Code</a>.</p>  <h3 id="record-a-new-test">Record a New Test<a href="#record-a-new-test" aria-label="Direct link to Record a New Test" title="Direct link to Record a New Test">​</a>
</h3> <p>To record a test click on the <strong>Record new</strong> button from the Testing sidebar. This will create a <code>test-1.spec.ts</code> file as well as open up a browser window.</p> <img width="1385" alt="record new in vs code" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/220961665-615d0ab8-3f0b-439c-ad0b-0424d9aa154b.png"> <p>In the browser go to the URL you wish to test and start clicking around to record your user actions.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/1d4c8f37-8325-4816-a665-d0e95e63f509" alt="generating user actions"></p> <p>Playwright will record your actions and generate the test code directly in VS Code. You can also generate assertions by choosing one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. The following assertions can be generated:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>'assert visibility'</code> to assert that an element is visible</li> <li>
<code>'assert text'</code> to assert that an element contains specific text</li> <li>
<code>'assert value'</code> to assert that an element has a specific value</li> </ul> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/d131eb35-b2ca-4bf4-a8ac-88b6e40dcf07" alt="generating assertions"></p> <p>Once you are done recording click the <strong>cancel</strong> button or close the browser window. You can then inspect your <code>test-1.spec.ts</code> file and manually improve it if needed.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/2ba4c212-4713-460a-b054-6dc6b67a9a7c" alt="code from a generated test"></p> <h3 id="record-at-cursor">Record at Cursor<a href="#record-at-cursor" aria-label="Direct link to Record at Cursor" title="Direct link to Record at Cursor">​</a>
</h3> <p>To record from a specific point in your test move your cursor to where you want to record more actions and then click the <strong>Record at cursor</strong> button from the Testing sidebar. If your browser window is not already open then first run the test with 'Show browser' checked and then click the <strong>Record at cursor</strong> button.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/77948ab8-92a2-435f-9833-0944da5ae664" alt="record at cursor in vs code"></p> <p>In the browser window start performing the actions you want to record.</p> <img width="1394" alt="add feed the dog to todo app" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/220960770-6435cec7-1723-42a8-8c1f-8244e2d800c7.png"> <p>In the test file in VS Code you will see your new generated actions added to your test at the cursor position.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/4f4bb34e-9cda-41fe-bf65-8d8016d84c7f" alt="code from a generated test"></p> <h3 id="generating-locators">Generating locators<a href="#generating-locators" aria-label="Direct link to Generating locators" title="Direct link to Generating locators">​</a>
