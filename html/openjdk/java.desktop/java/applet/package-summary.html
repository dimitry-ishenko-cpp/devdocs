</div> <section class="package-description" id="package-description"> <div class="block">Provides the classes necessary to create an applet and the classes an applet uses to communicate with its applet context. <p> The applet framework involves two entities: the <i>applet</i> and the <i>applet context</i>. An applet is an embeddable window (see the Panel class) with a few extra methods that the applet context can use to initialize, start, and stop the applet. </p>
<p> The applet context is an application that is responsible for loading and running applets. For example, the applet context could be a Web browser or an applet development environment. </p>
<p> This package has been deprecated and may be removed in a future version of the Java Platform. There is no replacement. All of the classes and interfaces in this package have been terminally deprecated. Users are advised to migrate their applications to other technologies.</p>
