<h1 title="Interface WatchKey" class="title">Interface WatchKey</h1> <section class="class-description" id="class-description">  <pre class="lang-java" data-language="java">public interface WatchKey</pre> <div class="block">A token representing the registration of a <a href="watchable.html" title="interface in java.nio.file"><code>watchable</code></a> object with a <a href="watchservice.html" title="interface in java.nio.file"><code>WatchService</code></a>. <p> A watch key is created when a watchable object is registered with a watch service. The key remains <a href="#isValid()"><code>valid</code></a> until: </p>
<ol> <li> It is cancelled, explicitly, by invoking its <a href="#cancel()"><code>cancel</code></a> method, or</li> <li> Cancelled implicitly, because the object is no longer accessible, or </li> <li> By <a href="watchservice.html#close()"><code>closing</code></a> the watch service. </li> </ol> <p> A watch key has a state. When initially created the key is said to be <em>ready</em>. When an event is detected then the key is <em>signalled</em> and queued so that it can be retrieved by invoking the watch service's <a href="watchservice.html#poll()"><code>poll</code></a> or <a href="watchservice.html#take()"><code>take</code></a> methods. Once signalled, a key remains in this state until its <a href="#reset()"><code>reset</code></a> method is invoked to return the key to the ready state. Events detected while the key is in the signalled state are queued but do not cause the key to be re-queued for retrieval from the watch service. Events are retrieved by invoking the key's <a href="#pollEvents()"><code>pollEvents</code></a> method. This method retrieves and removes all events accumulated for the object. When initially created, a watch key has no pending events. Typically events are retrieved when the key is in the signalled state leading to the following idiom: </p>
<div class="snippet-container"> <pre class="lang-java" data-language="java"><code class="language-java">    for (;;) {
        // retrieve key
        WatchKey key = watcher.take();

        // process events
        for (WatchEvent&lt;?&gt; event: key.pollEvents()) {
            :
        }

        // reset the key
        boolean valid = key.reset();
        if (!valid) {
            // object no longer registered
        }
    }
</code></pre> </div> <p> Watch keys are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. Where there are several threads retrieving signalled keys from a watch service then care should be taken to ensure that the <code>reset</code> method is only invoked after the events for the object have been processed. This ensures that one thread is processing the events for an object at any time.</p>

This method will continue to return the object even after the key is cancelled. <p> As the <code>WatchService</code> is intended to map directly on to the native file event notification facility (where available) then many of details on how registered objects are watched is highly implementation specific. When watching a directory for changes for example, and the directory is moved or renamed in the file system, there is no guarantee that the watch key will be cancelled and so the object returned by this method may no longer be a valid path to the directory.</p>
