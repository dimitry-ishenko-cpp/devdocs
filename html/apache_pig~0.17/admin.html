There are cases when one would like to avoid writing to the same output location. Pig provides admins/script writers with a property to check if multiple STORE statements make an attempt to write to the same output directory. And fail fast letting the user know of the same.</p> <p>Specifically this makes sense for file-based output locations (HDFS, Local FS, S3..) to avoid Pig script from failing when multiple MR jobs write to the same location. </p> <p>To enforce strict checking of output location, set <strong>pig.location.check.strict=true</strong>. See also <a href="start.html#properties">Pig Properties</a> on how to set this property.</p> </div>   <h2 id="Disabling+Pig+commands+and+operators">Disabling Pig commands and operators</h2> <div class="section"> <p>This is an admin feature providing ability to blacklist or/and whitelist certain commands and operations. Pig exposes a few of these that could be not very safe in a multitenant environment. For example, "sh" invokes shell commands, "set" allows users to change non-final configs. While these are tremendously useful in general, having an ability to disable would make Pig a safer platform. The goal is to allow administrators to be able to have more control over user scripts. Default behaviour would still be the same - no filters applied on commands and operators.</p> <p>There are two properties you can use to control what users are able to do</p> <ul> <li>pig.blacklist</li> <li>pig.whitelist</li> </ul>  <h3 id="Blacklisting">Blacklisting</h3> <p>Set "pig.blacklist" to a comma-delimited set of operators and commands. For eg, <strong>pig.blacklist=rm,kill,cross</strong> would disable users from executing any of "rm", "kill" commands and "cross" operator.</p>  <h3 id="Whitelisting">Whitelisting</h3> <p>This is an even safer approach to disallowing functionality in Pig. Using this you will be able to disable all commands and operators that are not a part of the whitelist. For eg, <strong>pig.whitelist=load,filter,store</strong> will disallow every command and operator other than "load", "filter" and "store".</p>  <h3 id="Note">Note</h3> <p>There should not be any conflicts between blacklist and whitelist. Make sure to have them entirely distinct or Pig will complain.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
