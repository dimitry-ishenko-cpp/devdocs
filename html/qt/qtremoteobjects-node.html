<h1 class="title">Qt Remote Objects Nodes</h1>   <p>In a QtRO network, information is passed between processes via QRemoteObjectNodes ("nodes"). This peer-to-peer functionality uses a small number of distinct packets passing the necessary data between nodes.</p> <p>Each process that participates in the network instantiates a Node-based type, such as <a href="qremoteobjectnode.html">QRemoteObjectNode</a>, <a href="qremoteobjecthost.html">QRemoteObjectHost</a>, or <a href="qremoteobjectregistryhost.html">QRemoteObjectRegistryHost</a>. The host types of Nodes provide additional functionality. Both <a href="qremoteobjecthost.html">QRemoteObjectHost</a> and <a href="qremoteobjectregistryhost.html">QRemoteObjectRegistryHost</a> support the <a href="qremoteobjecthostbase.html#enableRemoting">enableRemoting</a>() and the corresponding <a href="qremoteobjecthostbase.html#disableRemoting">disableRemoting</a>() methods, which are the key methods to expose source objects to the network. To use the <a href="qtremoteobjects-registry.html#registry">Registry</a> functionality, you need to have a <a href="qremoteobjectregistryhost.html">QRemoteObjectRegistryHost</a> on the network. Then, all other nodes can pass the RegistryHost's URL to the Node's <code>registryAddress</code> constructor parameter, or pass the URL to the <a href="qremoteobjectnode.html#registryUrl-prop">setRegistryUrl</a>() method.</p> <p>Since QtRO is a peer-to-peer network, to <a href="qremoteobjectnode.html#acquire">acquire</a>() a valid <a href="qtremoteobjects-replica.html#replica">Replica</a>, the replica's node needs to be connected to the node that hosts its <a href="qtremoteobjects-source.html#source">Source</a>. A host node is a node that allows other nodes to connect to it, which is accomplished by giving hosts unique addresses. This address is provided to the <a href="qremoteobjecthost.html">QRemoteObjectHost</a> constructor or set by the setHostUrl method. The node from which a replica is requested must establish the connection to the host node, to initialize the replica and keep it up to date.</p> <h2 id="connecting-nodes-using-qtro-urls">Connecting Nodes using QtRO URLs
</h2> <p>Host Nodes use custom URLs to simplify connections. Currently, QtRO supports two types of connections:</p> <ol class="1" type="1">
<li>A TCP connection using the standard TCP/IP protocol - supports connections between devices as well as between processes on the same device.</li> <li>A local connection - supports connections between processes on the same device. This type of connection can have less overhead, depending on the underlying Operating System features.</li> </ol> <p>For local connections, you must use a unique name. For TCP connections, you must provide a unique address and port number combination.</p> <p>Currently, QtRO does not include a <a href="http://www.zeroconf.org/">zeroconf</a> facility. Therefore, all processes or devices must know beforehand, how to connect to each other. A <a href="qremoteobjectregistry.html">QRemoteObjectRegistry</a> can be used to simplify the connection process for a network with multiple Host Nodes.</p> <p>The table below summarizes the connection types available:</p> <table class="generic" width="90%"> <thead><tr class="qt-style">
<th>URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr></thead> <tr class="odd" valign="top">
<td>("local:service")</td>
<td>Uses (internally) {<a href="qlocalserver.html">QLocalServer</a>}/{<a href="qlocalsocket.html">QLocalSocket</a>} classes to communicate between nodes.</td>

<td>("qnx:service")</td>
<td>QNX OS only. Uses a custom (named) channel for native communication between nodes.</td>
</tr> <tr class="even" valign="top">
<td>("localabstract:service")</td>
<td>Since 6.2. Linux/Android OSes only. Uses an abstract namespace for Unix domain sockets. This allows <a href="qlocalsocket.html">QLocalSocket</a> behavior to work on non-writable devices.</td>
</tr> </table> <p>Nodes have a few <a href="qremoteobjecthostbase.html#enableRemoting">enableRemoting</a>() methods that are used to share objects on the network. However, if the node is not a host node, an error is returned.</p> <p>Other processes or devices that want to interact with a shared object can use one of the <a href="qremoteobjectnode.html#acquire">node's acquire()</a> methods, to instantiate a replica.</p><div class="_attribution">
