<h1 class="title">date QML Basic Type</h1>   <p>The <code>date</code> type refers to a date value, including the time of the day.</p> <p>To create a <code>date</code> value, specify it as a "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.zzzZ" string. (The T is literal, YYYY is a full year number, MM and DD are month and day numbers, hh, mm and ss are hours, minutes and seconds, with .zzz as milliseconds and Z as time-zone offset. The T and following time are optional. If they are omitted, the date is handled as the start of UTC's day, which falls on other dates in some time-zones. When T is included, the :ss.zzz or just .zzz part can be omitted. With or without those, the zone offset can be omitted, in which case local time is used.) For example:</p> <pre data-language="qml">MyDatePicker { minDate: "2000-01-01 0:0"; maxDate: "2020-12-31 23:59" }</pre> <p>To read a date value returned from a C++ extension class, use <a href="qml-qtqml-qt.html#formatDate-method">Qt.formatDate</a>() and <a href="qml-qtqml-qt.html#formatDateTime-method">Qt.formatDateTime</a>().</p> <p>When integrating with C++, note that any <a href="qdate.html">QDate</a> or <a href="qdatetime.html">QDateTime</a> value <a href="qtqml-cppintegration-data.html">passed into QML from C++</a> is automatically converted into a <code>date</code> value, and vice-versa. Note, however, that converting a <a href="qdate.html">QDate</a> will result in UTC's start of the day, which falls on a different date in some other time-zones. It is usually more robust to convert the <a href="qdate.html">QDate</a> via a <a href="qdatetime.html">QDateTime</a> explicitly, specifying local-time or a relevant time-zone and selecting a time of day (such as noon) that reliably exists (daylight-savings transitions skip an hour, near one end or the other of a day).</p> <p>This basic type is provided by the QML language. It can be implicitly converted to a <a href="qml-qtqml-date.html">Date</a> object.</p>  <p><b>See also </b><a href="qml-qtqml-date.html">QML Date object</a> and <a href="qtqml-typesystem-basictypes.html">QML Basic Types</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
