<h1 class="title">Multithreading Technologies in Qt</h1>   <p>Qt offers many classes and functions for working with threads. Below are four different approaches that Qt programmers can use to implement multithreaded applications.</p> <h2 id="qthread-low-level-api-with-optional-event-loops">QThread: Low-Level API with Optional Event Loops
</h2> <p><a href="qthread.html">QThread</a> is the foundation of all thread control in Qt. Each <a href="qthread.html">QThread</a> instance represents and controls one thread.</p> <p><a href="qthread.html">QThread</a> can either be instantiated directly or subclassed. Instantiating a <a href="qthread.html">QThread</a> provides a parallel event loop, allowing <a href="qobject.html">QObject</a> slots to be invoked in a secondary thread. Subclassing a <a href="qthread.html">QThread</a> allows the application to initialize the new thread before starting its event loop, or to run parallel code without an event loop.</p> <p>See the <a href="qthread.html">QThread class reference</a> and the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/examples-threadandconcurrent.html">threading examples</a> for demonstrations on how to use <a href="qthread.html">QThread</a>.</p> <h2 id="qthreadpool-and-qrunnable-reusing-threads">QThreadPool and QRunnable: Reusing Threads
</h2> <p>Creating and destroying threads frequently can be expensive. To reduce this overhead, existing threads can be reused for new tasks. <a href="qthreadpool.html">QThreadPool</a> is a collection of reuseable QThreads.</p> <p>To run code in one of a <a href="qthreadpool.html">QThreadPool</a>'s threads, reimplement <a href="qrunnable.html#run">QRunnable::run</a>() and instantiate the subclassed <a href="qrunnable.html">QRunnable</a>. Use <a href="qthreadpool.html#start">QThreadPool::start</a>() to put the <a href="qrunnable.html">QRunnable</a> in the <a href="qthreadpool.html">QThreadPool</a>'s run queue. When a thread becomes available, the code within <a href="qrunnable.html#run">QRunnable::run</a>() will execute in that thread.</p> <p>Each Qt application has a global thread pool, which is accessible through <a href="qthreadpool.html#globalInstance">QThreadPool::globalInstance</a>(). This global thread pool automatically maintains an optimal number of threads based on the number of cores in the CPU. However, a separate <a href="qthreadpool.html">QThreadPool</a> can be created and managed explicitly.</p> <h2 id="qt-concurrent-using-a-high-level-api">Qt Concurrent: Using a High-level API
</h2> <p>The <a href="qtconcurrent-index.html">Qt Concurrent</a> module provides high-level functions that deal with some common parallel computation patterns: map, filter, and reduce. Unlike using <a href="qthread.html">QThread</a> and <a href="qrunnable.html">QRunnable</a>, these functions never require the use of <a href="threads-synchronizing.html#low-level-synchronization-primitives">low-level threading primitives</a> such as mutexes or semaphores. Instead, they return a <a href="qfuture.html">QFuture</a> object which can be used to retrieve the functions' results when they are ready. <a href="qfuture.html">QFuture</a> can also be used to query computation progress and to pause/resume/cancel the computation. For convenience, <a href="qfuturewatcher.html">QFutureWatcher</a> enables interactions with <a href="qfuture.html">QFuture</a>s via signals and slots.</p> <p><a href="qtconcurrent-index.html">Qt Concurrent</a>'s map, filter and reduce algorithms automatically distribute computation across all available processor cores, so applications written today will continue to scale when deployed later on a system with more cores.</p> <p>This module also provides the <a href="concurrent-changes-qt6.html#qtconcurrent-run">QtConcurrent::run</a>() function, which can run any function in another thread. However, <a href="concurrent-changes-qt6.html#qtconcurrent-run">QtConcurrent::run</a>() only supports a subset of features available to the map, filter and reduce functions. The <a href="qfuture.html">QFuture</a> can be used to retrieve the function's return value and to check if the thread is running. However, a call to <a href="concurrent-changes-qt6.html#qtconcurrent-run">QtConcurrent::run</a>() uses one thread only, cannot be paused/resumed/canceled, and cannot be queried for progress.</p> <p>See the <a href="qtconcurrent-index.html">Qt Concurrent</a> module documentation for details on the individual functions.</p> <h2 id="workerscript-threading-in-qml">WorkerScript: Threading in QML
</h2> <p>The <a href="qml-qtqml-workerscript-workerscript.html">WorkerScript</a> QML type lets JavaScript code run in parallel with the GUI thread.</p> <p>Each <a href="qml-qtqml-workerscript-workerscript.html">WorkerScript</a> instance can have one <code>.js</code> script attached to it. When <a href="qml-qtqml-workerscript-workerscript.html#sendMessage-method">WorkerScript.sendMessage</a>() is called, the script will run in a separate thread (and a separate <a href="qqmlcontext.html">QML context</a>). When the script finishes running, it can send a reply back to the GUI thread which will invoke the <a href="qml-qtqml-workerscript-workerscript.html#message-signal">WorkerScript.onMessage</a>() signal handler.</p> <p>Using a <a href="qml-qtqml-workerscript-workerscript.html">WorkerScript</a> is similar to using a worker <a href="qobject.html">QObject</a> that has been moved to another thread. Data is transferred between threads via signals.</p> <p>See the <a href="qml-qtqml-workerscript-workerscript.html">WorkerScript</a> documentation for details on how to implement the script, and for a list of data types that can be passed between threads.</p> <h2 id="choosing-an-appropriate-approach">Choosing an Appropriate Approach
</h2> <p>As demonstrated above, Qt provides different solutions for developing threaded applications. The right solution for a given application depends on the purpose of the new thread and the thread's lifetime. Below is a comparison of Qt's threading technologies, followed by recommended solutions for some example use cases.</p> <h3 id="comparison-of-solutions">Comparison of Solutions
