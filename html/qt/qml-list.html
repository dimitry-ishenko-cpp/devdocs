<h1 class="title">list QML Basic Type</h1>   <p>The <code>list</code> type refers to a list of QML objects.</p> <p>A list value can be accessed in a similar way to a JavaScript array:</p> <ul> <li>Values are assigned using the <code>[]</code> square bracket syntax with comma-separated values</li> <li>The <code>length</code> property provides the number of items in the list</li> <li>Values in the list are accessed using the <code>[index]</code> syntax</li> </ul> <p>Values can be dynamically added to the list by using the <code>push</code> method, as if it were a JavaScript Array</p> <p>A <code>list</code> can only store QML objects, and cannot contain any <a href="qtqml-typesystem-basictypes.html">basic type</a> values. (To store basic types within a list, use the <a href="qml-var.html">var</a> type instead.)</p> <p>When integrating with C++, note that any <a href="qqmllistproperty.html">QQmlListProperty</a> value <a href="qtqml-cppintegration-data.html">passed into QML from C++</a> is automatically converted into a <code>list</code> value, and vice-versa.</p> <h2 id="using-the-list-type">Using the list Type
</h2> <p>For example, the <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html">Item</a> type has a <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html#states-prop">states</a> list-type property that can be assigned to and used as follows:</p> <pre data-language="qml">import QtQuick 2.0

Item {
    width: 100; height: 100

    states: [
        State { name: "activated" },
        State { name: "deactivated" }
    ]

    Component.onCompleted: {
        console.log("Name of first state:", states[0].name)
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; states.length; i++)
            console.log("state", i, states[i].name)
    }
}</pre> <p>The defined <a href="qml-qtquick-state.html">State</a> objects will be added to the <code>states</code> list in the order in which they are defined.</p> <p>If the list only contains one object, the square brackets may be omitted:</p> <pre data-language="qml">import QtQuick 2.0

Item {
    width: 100; height: 100
    states: State { name: "activated" }
}</pre> <p>Note that objects cannot be individually added to or removed from the list once created; to modify the contents of a list, it must be reassigned to a new list.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p><b>Note: </b>The <code>list</code> type is not recommended as a type for custom properties. The <code>var</code> type should be used instead for this purpose as lists stored by the <code>var</code> type can be manipulated with greater flexibility from within QML.</p> </div> <p>This basic type is provided by the QML language.</p>  <p><b>See also </b><a href="qtqml-typesystem-basictypes.html">QML Basic Types</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
