<h1 class="title">Installing Clang for QDoc</h1>   <p>QDoc uses Clang when parsing C++ files as well as function signatures in <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/13-qdoc-commands-topics.html#fn-command">\fn</a> commands. Clang is part of <a href="https://llvm.org/">the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project</a>. Therefore, if you are going to build QDoc from source, you need to install <a href="http://clang.llvm.org">LLVM 8.0</a> or greater first.</p> <p>You can get Clang through various channels:</p> <ul> <li>Qt provides <a href="http://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/libclang/qt">prebuilt Clang packages</a> that are also used for the Qt binaries in the online installer. They allow to link LLVM/clang libraries statically, but only support Release builds on Windows.</li> <li>Linux distributions often provide a package called libclang-dev or libclang-devel.</li> <li>On macOS, you can also use Homebrew's <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/llvm">llvm formula</a>.</li> </ul> <div class="admonition note"> <p><b>Note: </b>the prebuilt binaries from <a href="http://releases.llvm.org/download.html">http://releases.llvm.org/download.html</a> cannot be used, as they miss certain components required by QDoc.</p> </div> <p>If you install Clang in a custom location you need to tell CMake where to find it. This can be done by adding the installation path to the <code>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</code> CMake cache variable.</p><div class="_attribution">
