<h1 class="title">Creating OPC UA Clients with security support</h1>   <p>One of the core features of OPC UA is the support for security, which means we get cryptographically encrypted and signed protocol, user authentication and authorization support.</p> <p>To make this work, each application instances (installation of a program) needs to have its own <code>Application Instance Certificate</code> and the according private key.</p> <p>The applications can either generate self-signed certificates on their own, get some from a certificate authority using OPC UA GDS, or simply can be configured with certificates which haven been created manually by the user.</p> <p>Because at the moment Qt OPC UA does not support certificate generation or GDS, this tutorial describes how to generate a self-signed OPC UA certificate on the command line using OpenSSL.</p> <h3 id="create-a-new-application-certificate">Create a new Application Certificate
</h3> <p>To be able to generate a correct x509v3 certificate with all required extensions for OPC UA, we need to setup a configuration file with all the necessary information first.</p> <p>Remember to change <code>subject</code> and <code>subjectAltName</code> to match your case.</p> <p>It is important to insert the <code>ApplicationURI</code> of the application into the <code>URI</code> field of <code>subjectAltName</code>, and that the hostname of your PC or device is inserted in the <code>DNS</code> fields of <code>subjectAltName</code>. Alternatively, you can use <code>IP</code> field if your device does not support host names and you are working with static IPs. Future versions of Qt OPC UA will be able to generate the certificate for you with correct information. For now, you can create one using the OpenSSL command line tool.</p> <p>Example: <code>opcuaviewer.config</code></p> <pre data-language="cpp">[ req ]

# secure private key file permissions
chmod 600 /path/to/application/pki/own/private/opcuaviewer.pem</pre> <p>It is important to secure the file permission of the private key, so that only the UA application can read it. For services (daemons), it is recommended to create dedicated unprivileged users accounts for this and make this user the owner of the key. For interactive applications, this key should be individual to the user. For interactive applications, it is also possible to password protect the key. In this case, the user needs to enter the password every time the application is started and loading the key. For this reason, password protected keys are not a good solution for unattended applications, because this would required to store the password in a configuration file.</p> <p>You can dump the certificate data using OpenSSL to inspect the contents of the certificate:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">        openssl x509 -in opcuaviewer.der -text -noout

</h3> <p>When connecting for the first time, the client needs to trust the server certificate.</p> <p>The client should display a certificate warning (with cert details) and offer the possibility to save the certificate in its trust list. For an example, see <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtopcua-opcuaviewer-example.html">Qt OPC UA Viewer Example</a>.</p> <p>When the client has accepted the server certificate, you can try to connect again. Now the server may reject the client's certificate. This is indicated by the generic error code <code>BadSecurityChecksFailed</code>. Server normally store rejected certificates in a special <code>rejected</code> folder. Administrator can move these into the trust list to trust clients. This avoids manually copying the client certificate to the server machine.</p> <p>As soon as the server has trusted the client, you should be able to connect with security.</p><div class="_attribution">
