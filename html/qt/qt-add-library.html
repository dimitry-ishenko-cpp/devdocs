<h1 class="title">qt_add_library</h1>   <p>Creates and finalizes a library.</p> <p>The command is defined in the <code>Core</code> component of the <code>Qt6</code> package.

</h2> <p><code>qt_add_library()</code> is a wrapper around CMake's built-in <code>add_library()</code> command. It performs the following tasks:</p> <ul> <li>Create a CMake target of an appropriate library type.</li> <li>Handle finalization of the CMake target.</li> </ul> <h3 id="target-creation">Target Creation
</h3> <p>The type of library created can be specified explicitly with one of the <code>STATIC</code>, <code>SHARED</code>, <code>MODULE</code>, <code>INTERFACE</code> or <code>OBJECT</code> keywords, just as one might for <code>add_library()</code>. If none of these keywords are given, the library type created depends on how Qt was built. If Qt was built statically, a static library will be created. Otherwise, a shared library will be created. Note that this is different to how CMake's <code>add_library()</code> command works, where the <code>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</code> variable controls the type of library created. The <code>qt_add_library()</code> command does not consider <code>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</code> when deciding the library type.</p> <p>Any <code>sources</code> provided will be passed through to the internal call to <code>add_library()</code>.</p> <h3 id="finalization">Finalization
</h3> <p>After a target is created, further processing or <i>finalization</i> steps may be needed. The finalization processing is implemented by the <a href="qt-finalize-target.html#qt6-finalize-target">qt_finalize_target()</a> command.</p> <p>Finalization can occur either as part of this call or be deferred to sometime after this command returns (but it should still be in the same directory scope). When using CMake 3.19 or later, finalization is automatically deferred to the end of the current directory scope. This gives the caller an opportunity to modify properties of the created target before it is finalized. When using CMake versions earlier than 3.19, automatic deferral isn't supported. In that case, finalization is performed immediately before this command returns.</p> <p>Regardless of the CMake version, the <code>MANUAL_FINALIZATION</code> keyword can be given to indicate that you will explicitly call <a href="qt-finalize-target.html#qt6-finalize-target">qt_finalize_target()</a> yourself instead at some later time. In general, <code>MANUAL_FINALIZATION</code> should not be needed unless the project has to support CMake 3.18 or earlier.</p>  <p><b>See also </b><a href="qt-finalize-target.html#qt6-finalize-target">qt_finalize_target()</a> and <a href="qt-add-executable.html#qt6-add-executable">qt_add_executable()</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
