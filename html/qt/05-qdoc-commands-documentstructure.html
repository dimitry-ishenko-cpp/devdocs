<h1 class="title">Document Structure</h1>   <p>The document structuring commands are for dividing your document into sections. QDoc supports four levels of section: <code>\section1</code>, <code>\section2</code>, <code>\section3</code>, and <code>\section4</code>. The section commands correspond to the traditional section, subsection, etc used in outlining.</p> <h2 id="section-commands">Section commands
</h2> <p>In general a document structuring command considers everything that follows it until the first line break as its argument. The argument is rendered as the unit's title. If the title needs to be spanned over several lines, make sure that each line (except the last one) is ended with a backslash.</p> <p>In total, there are four levels for sections in QDoc: <code>\section1</code>, <code>\section2</code>, <code>\section3</code> and <code>\section4</code>. These correspond to the traditional section, subsection, subsubsection and subsubsubsection.</p> <p>There is a strict ordering of the section units:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">section1
       |
       section2
              |
              section3
                     |
                     section4</pre> <p>When sections are used, the first section command should be <code>section1</code>.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">/ *!
