<h1 class="title">Including External Code</h1>   <p>The following commands enable you to include code snippets from external files. You can make QDoc include the complete contents of a file, or you can quote specific parts of the file and skip others. The typical use of the latter is to quote a file chunk by chunk.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p><b>Note: </b>Although all these commands can be used for rendering C++ code, the <a href="07-0-qdoc-commands-includingexternalcode.html#snippet-command">\snippet</a> and <a href="07-0-qdoc-commands-includingexternalcode.html#codeline-command">\codeline</a> commands are preferred over the others. These commands allow equivalent code snippets for other Qt language bindings to be substituted for the C++ snippets in the documentation.</p> </div> <h2 id="quotefile">\quotefile
</h2> <p>The \quotefile command expands to the complete contents of the file given as argument.</p> <p>The command considers the rest of the line as part of its argument, make sure to follow the file name with a line break.</p> <p>The file's contents is rendered in a separate paragraph, using a monospace font and the standard indentation. The code is shown verbatim.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">/ *!
