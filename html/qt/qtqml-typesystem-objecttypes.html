<h1 class="title">QML Object Types</h1>   <p>A QML object type is a type from which a QML object can be instantiated.</p> <p>In syntactic terms, a QML object type is one which can be used to declare an object by specifying the <i>type name</i> followed by a set of curly braces that encompasses the attributes of that object. This differs from <i>basic types</i>, which cannot be used in the same way. For example, <a href="qml-qtquick-rectangle.html">Rectangle</a> is a QML object type: it can be used to create <code>Rectangle</code> type objects. This cannot be done with primitive types such as <code>int</code> and <code>bool</code>, which are used to hold simple data types rather than objects.</p> <p>Custom QML object types can be defined by creating a .qml file that defines the type, as discussed in <a href="qtqml-documents-definetypes.html">Documents as QML object type definitions</a>, or by defining a QML type from C++ and registering the type with the QML engine, as discussed in <a href="qtqml-cppintegration-definetypes.html">Defining QML Types from C++</a>. Note that in both cases, the type name must begin with an uppercase letter in order to be declared as a QML object type in a QML file.</p> <h2 id="defining-object-types-from-qml">Defining Object Types from QML
</h2> <h3 id="defining-object-types-through-qml-documents">Defining Object Types Through QML Documents
</h3> <p>Plugin writers and application developers may provide types defined as QML documents. A QML document, when visible to the QML import system, defines a type identified by the name of the file minus the file extensions.</p> <p>Thus, if a QML document named "MyButton.qml" exists, it provides the definition of the "MyButton" type, which may be used in a QML application.</p> <p>See the documentation about <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtqml-documents-topic.html">QML Documents</a> for information on how to define a QML document, and the syntax of the QML language. Once you are familiar with the QML language and how to define QML documents, see the documentation which explains how to <a href="qtqml-documents-definetypes.html">define and use your own reusable QML types in QML documents</a>.</p> <p>See <a href="qtqml-documents-definetypes.html">Defining Object Types through QML Documents</a> for more information.</p> <h3 id="defining-anonymous-types-with-component">Defining Anonymous Types with Component
</h3> <p>Another method of creating object types from within QML is to use the <a href="qml-qtqml-component.html">Component</a> type. This allows a type to be defined inline within a QML document, instead of using a separate document in a <code>.qml</code> file.</p> <pre data-language="qml">Item {
    id: root
    width: 500; height: 500

    Component {
        id: myComponent
        Rectangle { width: 100; height: 100; color: "red" }
    }

    Component.onCompleted: {
        myComponent.createObject(root)
        myComponent.createObject(root, {"x": 200})
    }
}</pre> <p>Here the <code>myComponent</code> object essentially defines an anonymous type that can be instantiated using <a href="qml-qtqml-component.html#createObject-method">Component::createObject</a> to create objects of this anonymous type.</p> <p>Inline components share all the characteristics of regular top-level components and use the same <code>import</code> list as their containing QML document.</p> <p>Note that each <a href="qml-qtqml-component.html">Component</a> object declaration creates its own <i>component scope</i>. Any <i>id</i> values used and referred to from within a <a href="qml-qtqml-component.html">Component</a> object declaration must be unique within that scope, but do not need to be unique within the document within which the inline component is declared. So, the <a href="qml-qtquick-rectangle.html">Rectangle</a> declared in the <code>myComponent</code> object declaration could have an <i>id</i> of <code>root</code> without conflicting with the <code>root</code> declared for the <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html">Item</a> object in the same document, as these two <i>id</i> values are declared within different component scopes.</p> <p>See <a href="qtqml-documents-scope.html">Scope and Naming Resolution</a> for more details.</p> <h2 id="defining-object-types-from-c">Defining Object Types from C++
</h2> <p>C++ plugin writers and application developers may register types defined in C++ through API provided by the Qt QML module. There are various registration functions which each allow different use-cases to be fulfilled. For more information about those registration functions, and the specifics of exposing custom C++ types to QML, see the documentation regarding <a href="qtqml-cppintegration-definetypes.html">Defining QML Types from C++</a>.</p> <p>The QML type-system relies on imports, plugins and extensions being installed into a known import path. Plugins may be provided by third-party developers and reused by client application developers. Please see the documentation about <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtqml-modules-topic.html">QML modules</a> for more information about how to create and deploy a QML extension module.</p><div class="_attribution">
