<h1 class="title">Changes to Qt SCXML</h1>   <p>Qt 6 is a result of the conscious effort to make the framework more efficient and easy to use.</p> <p>We try to maintain binary and source compatibility for all the public APIs in each release. But some changes were inevitable in an effort to make Qt a better framework.</p> <p>In this topic we summarize those changes in Qt SCXML module, and provide guidance to handle them.</p> <h2 id="changes-overview">Changes overview
</h2> <p>The Qt SCXML module is largely source compatible with the Qt5 version and users of the library should be able to continue with no or minor changes to their project.</p> <h2 id="api-changes">API changes
</h2> <h3 id="qscxmlecmascriptdatamodel-api-removal">QScxmlEcmaScriptDataModel API removal
</h3> <p>The ecmascript datamodel, when enabled, introduces a dependency to the Qt QML library. In Qt5 this depedendency is created at build time, whereas in Qt6 the dependency is moved to runtime (internally a plugin). As a consequence the QScxmlEcmaScriptDataModel class is no longer part of the public API.</p> <h2 id="build-system">Build system
</h2> <p>As with Qt6 in general, the Qt SCXML module has cmake support in addition to qmake.</p> <h2 id="qml-imports">QML imports
</h2> <p>The QML import versioning is optional unless one has a specific reason for not using the latest. Generally speaking the versioned imports work from version 5.8 to 6.x, where 'x' is the current minor release.</p><div class="_attribution">
