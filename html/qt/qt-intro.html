<h1 class="title">What's New in Qt 6</h1>   <p>Qt 6 lets you develop applications with intuitive user interfaces for multiple devices and platforms, faster than ever before. Development is easy with <b>Qt Creator</b>, letting you design, code, test, and deploy Qt applications. Qt 6 is highly compatible with Qt 5. Developers of Qt 5 applications can move seamlessly to Qt 6 while retaining applications' functionality.</p> <h2 id="developing-user-interfaces-with-qt">Developing User Interfaces with Qt
</h2> <p>Qt offers two UI frameworks for developers: <b>Qt Widgets</b> and <b>Qt Quick</b>. <a href="qtwidgets-index.html">Qt Widgets</a> is cross-platform and tightly integrates with desktop look and feel. <a href="qtquick-index.html">Qt Quick</a> UIs are dynamic with fluid animations and are optimal for touch interfaces. You can implement widget UIs in C++ and you can implement Qt Quick UIs declaratively with QML and JavaScript. The <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/topics-ui.html">User Interfaces</a> page compares both Qt Quick and Qt Widgets UIs.</p> <h3 id="designing-uis">Designing UIs
</h3> <p>Qt Quick Designer lets you design UIs from within Qt Creator. You can import 2D and 3D assets, animate components, and create layouts. Testing the designs is possible through a live preview on devices are through an online browser.</p> <p>If you only design UIs and don't need the developer tools and functions, you can use <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/index.html">Qt Design Studio</a>. It enables you to define the look and feel of the UI from wireframe to final implementation with preset UI components. You can import UI design files from 2D and 3D tools to Qt Design Studio, which can turn them into code for developers. Qt Design Studio prototyping features bring your designs to life and simulate and validate interactions and dynamic behavior. You can test, preview, and fine-tune your designs to pixel-perfection live on the desktop or target device.</p> <h2 id="developing-applications">Developing Applications
</h2> <p><a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/index.html">Qt Creator</a> is a complete IDE for developing Qt applications. You can setup project files, code, debug, package, and deploy from within Qt Creator. You can configure either <a href="cmake-manual.html">CMake</a> or <a href="qmake-manual.html">qmake</a> to build projects when you create them using wizard templates.</p> <h2 id="cross-platform-development">Cross-Platform Development
</h2> <p>Qt is cross-platform and you can deploy onto different devices and platforms. <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/index.html">Qt Creator</a> has built-in project templates and kits for different platforms and devices. In addition, you can port Qt and create custom targets with <a href="qpa.html">Qt Platform Abstraction</a>.</p> <h2 id="qt-essential-and-qt-add-ons">Qt Essential and Qt Add-ons
</h2> <p>In Qt 6, the installation experience is easier and more flexible than before.The installation includes the <b>Qt Essentials</b> and a few of the most commonly used <b>Qt Add-Ons</b>. The Qt Add-Ons are moved outside of the main installation, but still available by running the installer. You can read the list of Qt modules in the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtmodules.html">Qt Modules</a> page.</p> <h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where To Go From Here
