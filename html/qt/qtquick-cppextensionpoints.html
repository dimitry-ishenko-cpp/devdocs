<h1 class="title">C++ Extension Points Provided By Qt Quick</h1>   <p>All QML applications can be extended from C++ in order to use additional functionality implemented in C++ code or to provide a C++ based QML plugin. This topic of extending QML from C++ is covered in the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtqml-cppintegration-topic.html">Integrating QML and C++</a> documentation.</p> <p>Additionally, the Qt Quick module provides several extension and integration points for C++ developers, specific to this module. In particular, it allows C++ developers to create and register custom <a href="qquickitem.html">QQuickItem</a>-derived types which can be rendered by Qt Quick. It also provides several scene graph-related classes which allow developers to define their own rendering primitives.</p> <h2 id="user-defined-qquickitem-derived-types">User-Defined QQuickItem-Derived Types
</h2> <p>While the Qt Quick module already provides a rich library of visual item types for use in a QML application, some developers may wish to define their own item-derived types in C++ and expose them to the QML type system. The easiest way to do this is to subclass <a href="qquickitem.html">QQuickItem</a>, which is the base type for all visual types in the Qt Quick module. See the <a href="qquickitem.html">QQuickItem</a> documentation for more details.</p> <h2 id="scene-graph-related-classes">Scene Graph-Related Classes
</h2> <p>Qt Quick 2 makes use of a dedicated scene graph based on OpenGL ES 2.0 or OpenGL 2.0 for its rendering. Using a scene graph for graphics rather than the traditional imperative painting systems (<a href="qpainter.html">QPainter</a> and similar), means the scene to be rendered can be retained between frames and the complete set of primitives to render is known before rendering starts. This opens up for a number of optimizations, such as batching the OpenGL draw calls to minimize state changes or discarding obscured primitives.</p> <p>The <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick-module.html">Qt Quick C++ API</a> provides various classes to enable custom nodes to be created in C++.</p> <p>See the <a href="qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html">Qt Quick Scene Graph</a> documentation for details.</p> <h2 id="pixmap-and-threaded-image-support">Pixmap and Threaded Image Support
</h2> <p>While the QML engine allows QML application to load images from filesystem or network resources, some applications may require the additional option of loading images from C++ based processes. This can be implemented through the <a href="qquickimageprovider.html">QQuickImageProvider</a> class, which provides support for pixmap loading and threaded image requests for QML applications. Any QML application that requests an image through the special "image:" URL scheme will be directed to an appropriate image provider to load the image.</p> <p>For more information, see the <a href="qquickimageprovider.html">QQuickImageProvider</a> documentation.</p><div class="_attribution">
