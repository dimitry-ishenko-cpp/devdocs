<h1 class="title">Prototyping with the QML Runtime Tool</h1>   <p>Qt includes the <code>qml</code> executable, a utility that loads and displays QML documents.</p> <p>The <code>qml</code> utility is meant mainly for testing your QML applications and components. To launch a QML application in a production environment, often you need to develop a custom C++ application, or bundle the QML file in a module. See <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick-deployment.html">Deploying QML applications</a> for more information. When given a bare <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html">Item</a> as root element, <code>qml</code> will automatically create a window to show the scene. Notably, <a href="qqmlcomponent.html#create">QQmlComponent::create</a>() will not do that. Therefore, when moving from a prototype developed with <code>qml</code> to a C++ application, you need to either make sure the root element is a <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qt3dextras-module.html#window">Window</a>, or create a <a href="qquickview.html">QQuickView</a> in C++ to hold the root <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html">Item</a>. But in the meantime, you can load and test parts of your prototype separately with the <code>qml</code> tool.</p> <p>To load a .qml file, provide the file path on the command prompt:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">$ qml myqmlfile.qml</pre> <p>To see the configuration options, run <code>qml</code> with the <code>--help</code> argument.</p> <p>When the root object in the QML file that you are loading is an Item rather than a Window, it needs to be wrapped in a Window to be shown. While this work is pending, the top-level object that is already loaded is represented by a <code>PartialScene</code> object. The <code>qml</code> tool then loads additional QML files to decide what to do next: one is a configuration file that specifies in what sort of container to wrap the <code>PartialScene</code>. The <code>PartialScene.container</code> property gives a URL pointing to QML source code for the container component, which normally should declare a <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qt3dextras-module.html#window">Window</a> in which to wrap the <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html">Item</a> that was loaded first. Thus, the process of wrapping an Item into a Window is programmable; and by default, these two additional QML files are loaded from resources inside the qml executable. You can list the available configurations with the <code>--list-conf</code> command:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">$ qml --list-conf
Built-in configurations:
  default
  resizeToItem</pre> <p>The <code>default</code> configuration provides default behavior: the root Item will be resized to fill the wrapper Window at startup, and also when the user resizes the window. The alternative <code>resizeToItem</code> configuration works the other way around: the Item can programmatically set its own size (for example by creating bindings to its own <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties), and the wrapper Window will be resized to fit (subject to any limits that may be imposed by the window system). You can choose either of these using the <code>-c</code> or <code>--config</code> option:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">$ qml -c resizeToItem selfResizingItem.qml</pre> <p>Additional configurations can be added by creating configuration directories in <a href="qstandardpaths.html#StandardLocation-enum">QStandardPaths::AppConfigLocation</a>, each with two QML files inside: a configuration file named <code>configuration.qml</code>, and a QML file that declares the Item wrapper, which can have any name.</p> <p>Here is an example <code>configuration.qml</code> file:</p> <pre data-language="qml">import QmlRuntime.Config 1.0

Configuration {
    PartialScene {
        itemType: "QQuickItem"
        container: Qt.resolvedUrl("ItemWrapper.qml")
    }
}</pre> <p>And here is the simplest-possible <code>ItemWrapper.qml</code> that the <code>container</code> property could point to:</p> <pre data-language="qml">import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.Window 2.0

Window {
    property Item containedObject: null
    onContainedObjectChanged: {
        if (containedObject == undefined || containedObject == null) {
            visible = false;
        } else {
            containedObject.parent = contentItem;
            visible = true;
        }
    }
}</pre> <p>When this has been done, you can use the <code>qml -c</code> option giving the complete path to the <code>configuration.qml</code> file, which specifies the path to the container object:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">$ qml -c ~/.config/QtProject/Qml\ Runtime/simplest/configuration.qml mycomponent.qml</pre> <p>The <code>qml</code> runtime will directly set the <code>containedObject</code> property, which is required to have that name; and when it is set, the <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html">Item</a> will be reparented to the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qt3dextras-module.html#window">Window</a> and shown. Since this Window is declared in QML, when you write your own wrapper window, you are free to add whatever additional features you would like: to handle resizing in a customized way, or to add capabilities that you may find useful during prototyping.</p> <p>In addition to the features that can be declared in the configuration files, the <code>qml</code> tool also provides a few more features via command-line options. Use the <code>--help</code> option to get an up-to-date list.</p><div class="_attribution">
