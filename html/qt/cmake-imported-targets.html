<h1 class="title">Imported targets</h1>   <p>Each Qt module that is loaded defines a CMake library target. The target names start with <code>Qt6::</code>, followed by the module name. For example: <code>Qt6::Core</code>, <code>Qt6::Gui</code>. Pass the name of the library target to <code>target_link_libraries</code> to use the respective library.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p><b>Note: </b>The targets are also available with a <code>Qt::</code> prefix: <code>Qt::Core</code>, <code>Qt::Gui</code>, and so on. See also <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/cmake-qt5-and-qt6-compatibility.html">Qt 5 and Qt 6 compatibility</a>.</p> </div> <p>Imported targets are created with the same configurations as when Qt was configured. That is:</p> <ul> <li>If Qt was configured with the <code>-debug</code> switch, an imported target with the DEBUG configuration is created.</li> <li>If Qt was configured with the <code>-release</code> switch, an imported target with the RELEASE configuration is created.</li> <li>If Qt was configured with the <code>-debug-and-release</code> switch, then imported targets are created with both RELEASE and DEBUG configurations.</li> </ul> <p>If your project has custom <code>CMake</code> build configurations, you have to map your custom configuration to either the debug or the release Qt configuration.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Core REQUIRED)
