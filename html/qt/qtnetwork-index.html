<h1 class="title">Qt Network</h1>   <p>The <a href="qtnetwork-index.html">Qt Network</a> module provides a set of APIs for programming applications that use TCP/IP. Operations such as requests, cookies, and sending data over HTTP are handled by various C++ classes.</p> <h2 id="using-the-module">Using the Module
</h2> <p>Using a Qt module requires linking against the module library, either directly or through other dependencies. Several build tools have dedicated support for this, including <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/documentation.html">CMake</a> and <a href="resources.html#qmake">qmake</a>.</p> <h3 id="building-with-cmake">Building with CMake
</h3> <p>Use the <code>find_package()</code> command to locate the needed module components in the <code>Qt6</code> package:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Network REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(mytarget PRIVATE Qt6::Network)</pre> <p>See also the <a href="cmake-manual.html">Build with CMake</a> overview.</p> <h3 id="building-with-qmake">Building with qmake
</h3> <p>Add <code>network</code> to the <code>QT</code> variable:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">QT += network</pre> <h2 id="articles-and-guides">Articles and Guides
