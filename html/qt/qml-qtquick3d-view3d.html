</h2> <p>View3D provides a 2D surface on which a 3D scene can be rendered. This surface is a Qt Quick <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html">Item</a> and can be placed in a Qt Quick scene.</p> <p>There are two ways to define the 3D scene that is visualized on the View3D: If you define a hierarchy of <a href="qml-qtquick3d-node.html">Node-based</a> items as children of the View3D directly, then this will become the implicit scene of the View3D.</p> <p>It is also possible to reference an existing scene by using the <a href="qml-qtquick3d-view3d.html#importScene-prop">importScene</a> property and setting it to the root <a href="qml-qtquick3d-node.html">Node</a> of the scene you want to visualize. This <a href="qml-qtquick3d-node.html">Node</a> does not have to be an ancestor of the View3D, and you can have multiple View3Ds that import the same scene.</p> <p>This is demonstrated in <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick3d-view3d-example.html">View3D example</a>.</p> <p>If the View3D both has child <a href="qml-qtquick3d-node.html">Nodes</a> and the <a href="qml-qtquick3d-view3d.html#importScene-prop">importScene</a> property is set simultaneously, then both scenes will be rendered as if they were sibling subtrees in the same scene.</p> <p>To control how a scene is rendered, you can set the <a href="qml-qtquick3d-view3d.html#environment-prop">environment</a> property. The type <a href="qml-qtquick3d-sceneenvironment.html">SceneEnvironment</a> has a number of visual properties that can be adjusted, such as background color, tone mapping, anti-aliasing and more.</p> <p>In addition, in order for anything to be rendered in the View3D, the scene needs a <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick3d-intro-example.html#camera">Camera</a>. If there is only a single <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick3d-intro-example.html#camera">Camera</a> in the scene, then this will automatically be picked. Otherwise, the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick3d-intro-example.html#camera">camera</a> property can be used to select the camera. The <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick3d-intro-example.html#camera">Camera</a> decides which parts of the scene are visible, and how they are projected onto the 2D surface.</p> <p>By default, the 3D scene will first be rendered into an off-screen buffer and then composited with the rest of the Qt Quick scene when it is done. This provides the maximum level of compatibility, but may have performance implications on some graphics hardware. If this is the case, the <a href="qml-qtquick3d-view3d.html#renderMode-prop">renderMode</a> property can be used to switch how the View3D is rendered into the window.</p> <p>A View3D with the default Offscreen <a href="qml-qtquick3d-view3d.html#renderMode-prop">renderMode</a> is implicitly a <a href="qsgtextureprovider.html">texture provider</a> as well. This means that <a href="qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html">ShaderEffect</a> or <a href="qml-qtquick3d-texture.html#sourceItem-prop">Texture.sourceItem</a> can reference the View3D directly as long as all items live within the same <a href="qquickwindow.html">window</a>. Like with any other <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html">Item</a>, it is also possible to switch the View3D, or one of its ancestors, into a texture-based <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html#layer.enabled-prop">item layer</a>.</p> <p><b>See also </b><a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick3d-view3d-example.html">Qt Quick 3D - View3D example</a>.</p>  <h2>Property Documentation</h2>  <h3 class="qmlproto" id="camera-prop"><p> <span class="name">camera</span> : <span class="type"><a href="qml-qtquick3d-camera.html">QtQuick3D::Camera</a></span></p></h3> <p>This property specifies which <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick3d-intro-example.html#camera">Camera</a> is used to render the scene.

This off-screen buffer is then rendered into the window (or render target) like any other Qt Quick <a href="qml-qtquick-item.html">Item</a>.</p> <p>For most users, there will be no need to change the render mode, and this property can safely be ignored. But on some graphics hardware, the use of an off-screen buffer can be a performance bottleneck. If this is the case, it might be worth experimenting with other modes.</p> <table class="valuelist">
