It supports the same set of arguments as this command.</p> <h2 id="description">Description
</h2> <div class="admonition note"> <p><b>Note: </b>This command only has any effect if Qt was built statically. If called using a non-static Qt, it will do nothing and return immediately.</p> </div> <p><code>qt_import_qml_plugins()</code> runs <code>qmlimportscanner</code> on the <code>target</code> immediately as part of the call. It finds the static QML plugins used by the <code>target</code> and links it to those plugins so that they are part of the executable or shared library that <code>target</code> represents. The search follows QML module imports recursively.</p> <p>Because the call to <code>qmlimportscanner</code> runs at configure time rather than generation or build time, <code>qt_import_qml_plugins()</code> only knows about the information recorded on the <code>target</code> (or other targets it links or imports) at the time <code>qt_import_qml_plugins()</code> is called. Any linking or import relationships added after this call will not be considered. Therefore, this command should be called as late as possible in the <code>target</code>'s directory scope so that all the linking and import relationships are known.</p> <p>If <code>target</code> was created using <a href="qt-add-executable.html#qt6-add-executable">qt_add_executable()</a>, projects would not normally need to call <code>qt_import_qml_plugins()</code> directly. When Qt is built statically, the command is called automatically as part of <a href="qt-add-executable.html#finalization">target finalization</a> if <code>target</code> links to the Qml library. By default, this finalization occurs at the end of the same directory scope in which the <code>target</code> was created. If the <code>target</code> was created using the standard CMake <code>add_executable()</code> command instead, the project needs to call <code>qt_import_qml_plugins()</code> itself.</p>  <p><b>See also </b><a href="qqmlextensionplugin-proxy.html#Q_IMPORT_QML_PLUGIN">Q_IMPORT_QML_PLUGIN</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
