<h1 class="title">qt_add_executable</h1>   <p>Creates and finalizes an application target of a platform-specific type.</p> <p>The command is defined in the <code>Core</code> component of the <code>Qt6</code> package. Load the package with:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Core REQUIRED)</pre> <h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis

                  sources...)</pre> <p>If <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/cmake-qt5-and-qt6-compatibility.html#versionless-commands">versionless commands</a> are disabled, use <code>qt6_add_executable()</code> instead. It supports the same set of arguments as this command.</p> <h2 id="description">Description
</h2> <p>This command performs the following tasks:</p> <ul> <li>Create a CMake target of the appropriate type for the target platform.</li> <li>Link the target to the <code>Qt::Core</code> library.</li> <li>Handle finalization of the CMake target.</li> </ul> <h3 id="target-creation">Target Creation
</h3> <p>On all platforms except Android, an executable target will be created. All arguments will be passed through to the standard CMake <code>add_executable()</code> command, except <code>MANUAL_FINALIZATION</code> (if present). On Android, a <code>MODULE</code> library will be created and any <code>WIN32</code> or <code>MACOSX_BUNDLE</code> options will be ignored. Some target properties will also be set for Android:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>SUFFIX</code> target property will be set to give the library file name an architecture-specific suffix.</li> <li>Various <code>&lt;lang&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET</code> target properties will be set to <code>default</code> to ensure that the <code>main()</code> function is visible in the resultant binary.</li> </ul> <h3 id="linking-qt-core">Linking Qt::Core
</h3> <p>Since all Qt applications need to link to the <code>Qt::Core</code> library, this is done for you as a convenience.</p> <h3 id="finalization">Finalization
</h3> <p>After a target is created, further processing or <i>finalization</i> steps are commonly needed. The steps to perform depend on the platform and on various properties of the target. The finalization processing is implemented by the <a href="qt-finalize-target.html#qt6-finalize-target">qt_finalize_target()</a> command.</p> <p>Finalization can occur either as part of this call or be deferred to sometime after this command returns (but it should still be in the same directory scope). When using CMake 3.19 or later, finalization is automatically deferred to the end of the current directory scope. This gives the caller an opportunity to modify properties of the created target before it is finalized. When using CMake versions earlier than 3.19, automatic deferral isn't supported. In that case, finalization is performed immediately before this command returns.</p> <p>Regardless of the CMake version, the <code>MANUAL_FINALIZATION</code> keyword can be given to indicate that you will explicitly call <a href="qt-finalize-target.html#qt6-finalize-target">qt_finalize_target()</a> yourself instead at some later time. In general, <code>MANUAL_FINALIZATION</code> should not be needed unless the project has to support CMake 3.18 or earlier.</p> <h2 id="examples">Examples
</h2> <p>In the following simple case, finalization is handled automatically. If using a CMake version earlier than 3.19, finalization will be performed immediately as part of the call. When using CMake 3.19 or later, finalization will occur at the end of the current directory scope.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">qt_add_executable(simpleapp main.cpp)</pre> <p>The following example shows a scenario where finalization must be deferred. The <code>OUTPUT_NAME</code> target property affects deployment settings on Android, but those settings are written out as part of finalizing the target. In order to support using CMake versions earlier than 3.19, we take over responsibility for finalizing the target by adding the <code>MANUAL_FINALIZATION</code> keyword.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">qt_add_executable(complexapp MANUAL_FINALIZATION complex.cpp)
