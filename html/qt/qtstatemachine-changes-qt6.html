<h1 class="title">Changes to Qt State Machine</h1>   <p>Qt 6 is a result of the conscious effort to make the framework more efficient and easy to use.</p> <p>We try to maintain binary and source compatibility for all the public APIs in each release. But some changes were inevitable in an effort to make Qt a better framework.</p> <p>In this topic we summarize those changes in Qt State Machine module, and provide guidance to handle them.</p> <h2 id="changes">Changes
</h2> <p>The Qt <a href="qml-qtqml-statemachine-statemachine.html">StateMachine</a> module is generally speaking source compatible with the Qt5 version and users of the library should be able to continue with no or minor changes to their project.</p> <h3 id="qsignaltransition">QSignalTransition
</h3> <p>The <a href="qsignaltransition.html#senderObject">QSignalTransition::senderObject</a>() getter and the related <a href="qobject.html#Q_PROPERTY">Q_PROPERTY</a> now also use const <a href="qobject.html">QObject</a>*. These are now better aligned with the setter <a href="qsignaltransition.html#setSenderObject">QSignalTransition::setSenderObject</a>(const QObject*) that takes a const <a href="qobject.html">QObject</a>* as a parameter.</p> <h2 id="build-system">Build system
</h2> <p>As with Qt 6 in general, the Qt State Machine module has cmake support in addition to qmake.</p> <h2 id="qml-imports">QML imports
</h2> <p>The QML import versioning is optional unless one has a specific reason for not using the latest. Generally speaking the versioned imports work from version 5.8 to 6.x, where 'x' is the current minor release.</p><div class="_attribution">
