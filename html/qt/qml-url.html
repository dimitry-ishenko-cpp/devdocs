<h1 class="title">url QML Basic Type</h1>   <p>The <code>url</code> type refers to a resource locator (like a file name, for example). It can be either absolute, e.g. "http://qt-project.org", or relative, e.g. "pics/logo.png". A relative URL is resolved relative to the URL of the containing component.</p> <p>For example, the following assigns a valid URL to the <a href="qml-qtquick-image.html#source-prop">Image::source</a> property, which is of type <code>url</code>:</p> <pre data-language="qml">Image { source: "pics/logo.png" }</pre> <p>When integrating with C++, note that any <a href="qurl.html">QUrl</a> value <a href="qtqml-cppintegration-data.html">passed into QML from C++</a> is automatically converted into a <code>url</code> value, and vice-versa.</p> <p>Alternatively you may convert your <code>url</code> to a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL">URL</a> object in order to access and modify its components:</p> <pre data-language="qml">var urlObject = new URL(url);</pre> <div class="admonition note"> <p><b>Note: </b>In Qt 5, URLs were automatically resolved based on the current context when assigning them to any <code>url</code> property. This made it impossible to work with relative URLs and it created inconsistent behavior when reading back a URL previously written to a property. Therefore, the behavior was changed in Qt 6.</p> </div> <div class="admonition note"> <p><b>Note: </b>When referring to files stored with the <a href="resources.html">Qt Resource System</a> from within QML, you should use "qrc:///" instead of ":/" as QML requires URL paths. Relative URLs resolved from within that file will use the same protocol.</p> </div> <p>Additionally, URLs may contain encoded characters using the 'percent-encoding' scheme specified by <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>. These characters will be preserved within properties of type <code>url</code>, to allow QML code to construct precise URL values.</p> <p>For example, a local file containing a '#' character, which would normally be interpreted as the beginning of the URL 'fragment' element, can be accessed by encoding the characters of the file name:</p> <pre data-language="qml">Image { source: encodeURIComponent("/tmp/test#1.png") }</pre> <p>This basic type is provided by the QML language.</p>  <p><b>See also </b><a href="qtqml-typesystem-basictypes.html">QML Basic Types</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
