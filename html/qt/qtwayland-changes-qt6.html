<h1 class="title">Porting to Qt 6 - Qt Wayland Compositor</h1>   <p>Qt 6 is a result of the conscious effort to make the framework more efficient and easy to use.</p> <p>We try to maintain binary and source compatibility for all the public APIs in each release. But some changes were inevitable in an effort to make Qt a better framework.</p> <p>In this topic we summarize those changes in Qt Wayland Compositor, and provide guidance to handle them.</p> <h2 id="import-of-shell-classes">Import of Shell Classes
</h2> <p>In Qt 5, a few auxiliary classes were available through the Qt Wayland Compositor namespace. In order to improve the logical separation of these from the primary functionality of the compositor, they have been moved into separate imports in Qt 6.</p> <ul> <li>
