<h1 class="title">Inter-Process Communication in Qt</h1>   <p>Qt provides several ways to implement Inter-Process Communication (IPC) in Qt applications.</p> <h2 id="tcp-ip">TCP/IP
</h2> <p>The cross-platform <a href="qtnetwork-index.html">Qt Network</a> module provides classes that make network programming portable and easy. It offers high-level classes (e.g. <a href="qnetworkaccessmanager.html">QNetworkAccessManager</a>) that communicate using specific application-level protocols, and lower-level classes (e.g., <a href="qtcpsocket.html">QTcpSocket</a>, <a href="qtcpserver.html">QTcpServer</a>, <a href="qsslsocket.html">QSslSocket</a>) for implementing protocols.</p> <h2 id="local-server-socket">Local Server/Socket
</h2> <p>The cross-platform <a href="qtnetwork-index.html">Qt Network</a> module provides classes that make local network programming portable and easy. It offers the <a href="qlocalserver.html">QLocalServer</a> and <a href="qlocalsocket.html">QLocalSocket</a> classes that allow for network-like communication in a local setup. Their TCP counterparts can be used as drop-in replacement to make the communication work across networks.</p> <h2 id="shared-memory">Shared Memory
</h2> <p>The cross-platform shared memory class, <a href="qsharedmemory.html">QSharedMemory</a>, provides access to the operating system's shared memory implementation. It allows safe access to shared memory segments by multiple threads and processes. Additionally, <a href="qsystemsemaphore.html">QSystemSemaphore</a> can be used to control access to resources shared by the system, as well as to communicate between processes.</p> <h2 id="d-bus-protocol">D-Bus protocol
</h2> <p>The <a href="qtdbus-index.html">Qt D-Bus</a> module is a Unix-only library you can use to implement IPC using the D-Bus protocol. It extends Qt's <a href="signalsandslots.html">Signals and Slots</a> mechanism to the IPC level, allowing a signal emitted by one process to be connected to a slot in another process. The <a href="qtdbus-index.html">Qt D-Bus</a> documentation has detailed information on how to use the <a href="qtdbus-index.html">Qt D-Bus</a> module.</p> <h2 id="qprocess-class">QProcess Class
</h2> <p>The cross-platform class <a href="qprocess.html">QProcess</a> can be used to start external programs as child processes, and to communicate with them. It provides an API for monitoring and controlling the state of the child process. <a href="qprocess.html">QProcess</a> gives access to the input/output channels of child process by inheriting from <a href="qiodevice.html">QIODevice</a>.</p> <h2 id="session-management">Session Management
</h2> <p>On Linux/X11, Windows and macOS, Qt provides support for session management. Sessions allow events to be propagated to processes, for example, to notify when a shutdown occurs. The process and applications can then perform any necessary operations such as save open documents.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/session.html">Session Management</a></li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
