<h1 class="title">Qt for Linux/X11 - Specific Issues</h1>   <p>This page contains information about the X11 platforms Qt is currently known to run on, with links to platform-specific notes.</p> <h2 id="linux">Linux
</h2> <p>There are no known problems with using Qt on production versions of Linux/x86, Linux/ppc, Linux/amd64 and Linux/ia64 (including Altix(R)).</p> <p>For information about the specific compilers supported, visit the <a href="supported-platforms.html">supported platforms</a> page.</p> <h3 id="installation-problems">Installation problems
</h3> <p>Installing the source (<i>.tgz</i>) will likely conflict with the Qt version from your Linux distribution. This can result in link errors, such as:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">undefined reference to '_vt.11QPushButton'</pre> <p>This is solved by removing the older version of the library.</p> <p>If you have problems installing open source versions of Qt provided by your Linux distribution, for example, from RPM or APT repositories, please consult the maintainers of the distribution.</p> <p>Some RPM versions have problems installing some of the Qt RPM archives where installation stops with an error message warning about a <b>Failed Dependency</b>. Use the <code>--nodeps</code> option of <code>rpm</code> as workaround this problem.</p> <h3 id="intel-c-compiler-for-linux">Intel C++ Compiler for Linux
</h3> <p>Qt can be compiled with the Intel C++ compile for Linux, though, this configuration is not tested on a regular basis.</p> <h3 id="known-issues-with-intel-c-compiler-for-linux">Known Issues with Intel C++ Compiler for Linux
</h3> <ul> <li>Precompiled header support does not work in version 10.0.025 and older. For these compilers, you should configure Qt with -no-pch. Precompiled header support works properly in version 10.0.026 and later.</li> <li>Version 10.0.026 for Intel 64 is known to miscompile qmake when building in release mode. For now, configure Qt with -debug. Version 10.1.008 and later can compile qmake in release mode.</li> <li>Versions 10.1.008 to 10.1.015 for both IA-32 and Intel 64 are known crash with "(0): internal error: 0_47021" when compiling <a href="qtdesigner-manual.html">Qt Designer</a> in release mode. Version 10.1.017 compiles these modules correctly in release mode.</li> </ul> <h3 id="known-issues-with-gcc-compilers">Known Issues with GCC Compilers
</h3> <p>Building Qt with certain versions of GCC has the following known issues:</p> <ul> <li>GCC 5.2.1: Nested structs do not get their constructors called under some circumstances:<ul> <li>
