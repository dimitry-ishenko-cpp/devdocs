<h1 class="title">Getting started with CMake</h1>   <p><code>CMake</code> is a group of tools that allow to build, test, and package applications. Just like Qt, it is available on all major development platforms. It is also supported by various IDE's, including <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/index.html">Qt Creator</a>.</p> <p>In this section we will show the most basic way to use Qt in a CMake project. We will walk through an example project that is utilizing <a href="qtwidgets-index.html">Qt Widgets</a>.</p> <h3 id="build-a-c-gui-executable">Build a C++ GUI executable
</h3> <p>A <code>CMake</code> project is defined by files written in the CMake language. The main file is called <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, and is usually placed in the same directory as the actual program sources.</p> <p>Here is a typical <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file for an application written in C++ and using Qt and <a href="qtwidgets-index.html">Qt Widgets</a>:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)

project(helloworld VERSION 1.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)
set(CMAKE_AUTORCC ON)
set(CMAKE_AUTOUIC ON)

find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Widgets REQUIRED)

add_executable(helloworld
    mainwindow.ui
    mainwindow.cpp
    main.cpp
    resources.qrc
)

target_link_libraries(helloworld PRIVATE Qt6::Widgets)</pre> <p>Let's go through the content.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)</pre> <p><code>cmake_minimum_required()</code> specifies the minimum CMake version that the application requires. Qt itself requires at least CMake version 3.16. If you use a Qt that was built statically - the default in <a href="ios.html">Qt for iOS</a> and <a href="wasm.html">Qt for WebAssembly</a> - you need CMake 3.21.1 or newer.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">project(helloworld VERSION 1.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)</pre> <p><code>project()</code> sets a project name and the default project version. The <code>LANGUAGES</code> argument tells CMake that the program is written in C++.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)</pre> <p>Qt 6 requires a compiler supporting C++ version 17 or newer. Enforcing this by setting the <code>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD</code>, <code>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</code> variables will let CMake print an error if the compiler is too old.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)
set(CMAKE_AUTORCC ON)
set(CMAKE_AUTOUIC ON)</pre> <p>Qt applications typically make use of the <a href="moc.html">Meta-Object Compiler (moc)</a>, <a href="rcc.html">Resource Compiler (rcc)</a>, and <a href="uic.html">User Interface Compiler (uic)</a> that come with Qt. Setting the <code>CMAKE_AUTOMOC</code>, <code>CMAKE_AUTORCC</code>, and <code>CMAKE_AUTOUIC</code> variables to <code>ON</code> will let CMake automatically set up rules so that the respective compilers are called transparently, when required.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Widgets REQUIRED)</pre> <p>This tells CMake to look up Qt 6, and import the <code>Widgets</code> module. There is no point in continuing if <code>CMake</code> cannot locate the module, so we do set the <code>REQUIRED</code> flag to let CMake abort in this case.</p> <p>If successful, the module will set some CMake variables documented in <a href="cmake-variable-reference.html#module-variables">Module variables</a>. It furthermore imports the <code>Qt6::Widgets</code> target that we use below.</p> <p>For <code>find_package</code> to be successful, <code>CMake</code> must find the Qt installation. There are different ways you can tell <code>CMake</code> about Qt, but the most common and recommended approach is to set the CMake cache variable <code>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</code> to include the Qt 6 installation prefix. Note that <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/index.html">Qt Creator</a> will handle this transparently for you.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">add_executable(helloworld
    mainwindow.ui
    mainwindow.cpp
    main.cpp
    resources.qrc
)</pre> <p><code>add_executable()</code> tells CMake that we want to build an executable (so not a library) called <code>helloworld</code> as a target. The target should be built from C++ code (<code>mainwindow.cpp</code>, <code>main.cpp</code>), a <a href="qtdesigner-manual.html">Qt Designer</a> file (<code>mainwindow.ui</code>), and a <a href="resources.html">Qt Resource System</a> file (<code>resources.qrc</code>).</p> <p>Note that you typically do not list header files here. This is different from <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick-deployment.html#qmake">qmake</a>, where header files need to be explicitly listed so that they are processed by the <a href="moc.html">Meta-Object Compiler (moc)</a>.</p> <p>For less trivial projects, you may want to call <a href="qt-add-executable.html#qt6-add-executable">qt_add_executable()</a> instead. It is a wrapper around the built-in <code>add_executable()</code> command, providing additional logic to automatically handle things like linking of Qt plugins in static Qt builds, platform-specific customization of library names and so on.</p> <pre data-language="cpp">target_link_libraries(helloworld PRIVATE Qt6::Widgets)</pre> <p>Finally, <code>target_link_libraries</code> tells CMake that the <code>helloworld</code> executable makes use of <a href="qtwidgets-index.html">Qt Widgets</a> by referencing the <code>Qt6::Widgets</code> target imported by the <code>find_package()</code> call above. This will not only add the right arguments to the linker, but also makes sure that the right include directories, compiler definitions are passed to the C++ compiler. The <code>PRIVATE</code> keyword is not strictly necessary for an executable target, but it is good practice to specify it. If <code>helloworld</code> was a library rather than an executable, then either <code>PRIVATE</code> or <code>PUBLIC</code> should be specified (<code>PUBLIC</code> if the library mentions anything from <code>Qt6::Widgets</code> in its headers, <code>PRIVATE</code> otherwise).</p> <h3 id="further-reading">Further reading
