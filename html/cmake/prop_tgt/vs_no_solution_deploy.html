<h1 id="prop_tgt:VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY">VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">Added in version 3.15.</span></p> </div> <p>Specify that the target should not be marked for deployment to a Windows CE or Windows Phone device in the generated Visual Studio solution.</p> <p>Be default, all EXE and shared library (DLL) targets are marked to deploy to the target device in the generated Visual Studio solution.</p> <p>Generator expressions are supported.</p> <p>There are reasons one might want to exclude a target / generated project from deployment:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The library or executable may not be necessary in the primary deploy/debug scenario, and excluding from deployment saves time in the develop/download/debug cycle.</li> <li>There may be insufficient space on the target device to accommodate all of the build products.</li> <li>Visual Studio 2013 requires a target device IP address be entered for each target marked for deployment. For large numbers of targets, this can be tedious. NOTE: Visual Studio <em>will</em> deploy all project dependencies of a project tagged for deployment to the IP address configured for that project even if those dependencies are not tagged for deployment.</li> </ul>  <h2>Example 1</h2> <p>This shows setting the variable for the target foo.</p> <pre data-language="cmake">add_library(foo SHARED foo.cpp)
set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY ON)
</pre>   <h2>Example 2</h2> <p>This shows setting the variable for the Release configuration only.</p> <pre data-language="cmake">add_library(foo SHARED foo.cpp)
set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY "$&lt;CONFIG:Release&gt;")
