<h1 id="prop_tgt:INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH">INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 3.16.</span></p> </div> <p>Controls whether toolchain-defined rpaths should be removed during installation.</p> <p>When a target is being installed, CMake may need to rewrite its rpath information. This occurs when the install rpath (as specified by the <a class="reference internal" href="install_rpath.html#prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH" title="INSTALL_RPATH" id="index-0-prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH"><code>INSTALL_RPATH</code></a> target property) has different contents to the rpath that the target was built with. Some toolchains insert their own rpath contents into the binary as part of the build. By default, CMake will preserve those extra inserted contents in the install rpath. For those scenarios where such toolchain-inserted entries need to be discarded during install, set the <code>INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH</code> target property to true.</p> <p>This property is initialized by the value of <a class="reference internal" href="../variable/cmake_install_remove_environment_rpath.html#variable:CMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH" title="CMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH"><code>CMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH</code></a> when the target is created.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
