<h1 id="prop_tgt:Fortran_BUILDING_INSTRINSIC_MODULES">Fortran_BUILDING_INSTRINSIC_MODULES</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">Added in version 3.22.</span></p> </div> <p>Instructs the CMake Fortran preprocessor that the target is building Fortran intrinsics for building a Fortran compiler.</p> <p>This property is off by default and should be turned only on projects that build a Fortran compiler. It should not be turned on for projects that use a Fortran compiler.</p> <p>Turning this property on will correctly add dependencies for building Fortran intrinsic modules whereas turning the property off will ignore Fortran intrinsic modules in the dependency graph as they are supplied by the compiler itself.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
