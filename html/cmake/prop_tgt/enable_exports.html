<h1 id="prop_tgt:ENABLE_EXPORTS">ENABLE_EXPORTS</h1> <p>Specify whether an executable or a shared library exports symbols.</p> <p>Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the final program. It is possible for an executable to export symbols to be used by loadable modules. When this property is set to true CMake will allow other targets to "link" to the executable with the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/target_link_libraries.html#command:target_link_libraries" title="target_link_libraries" id="index-0-command:target_link_libraries"><code>target_link_libraries()</code></a> command. On all platforms a target-level dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it. Handling of the executable on the link lines of the loadable modules varies by platform:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>On Windows-based systems (including Cygwin) an "import library" is created along with the executable to list the exported symbols. Loadable modules link to the import library to get the symbols.</li> <li>On macOS, loadable modules link to the executable itself using the <code>-bundle_loader</code> flag.</li> <li>On AIX, a linker "import file" is created along with the executable to list the exported symbols for import when linking other targets. Loadable modules link to the import file to get the symbols.</li> <li>On other platforms, loadable modules are simply linked without referencing the executable since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.</li> </ul> <p>This property is initialized by the value of the <a class="reference internal" href="../variable/cmake_executable_enable_exports.html#variable:CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS" title="CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS"><code>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS</code></a> variable, if it is set when an executable target is created. If <a class="reference internal" href="../variable/cmake_executable_enable_exports.html#variable:CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS" title="CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS" id="index-1-variable:CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS"><code>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS</code></a> is not set, the <a class="reference internal" href="../variable/cmake_enable_exports.html#variable:CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS" title="CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS"><code>CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS</code></a> variable is used to initialize the property instead for backward compatibility reasons. See below for alternative initialization behavior for shared library targets.</p> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">Added in version 3.27: </span>To link with a shared library on macOS, or to a shared framework on any Apple platform, a linker import file can be used instead of the actual shared library. These linker import files are also known as text-based stubs, and they have a <code>.tbd</code> file extension.</p> <p>The generation of these linker import files, as well as their consumption, is controlled by this property. When this property is set to true on a shared library target, CMake will generate a <code>.tbd</code> file for the library. Other targets that link to the shared library target will then use this <code>.tbd</code> file when linking rather than linking to the shared library binary.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>For backward compatibility reasons, this property will be ignored if the <a class="reference internal" href="#" title="XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;" id="index-0-prop_tgt:XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;"><code>XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_GENERATE_TEXT_BASED_STUBS</code></a> target property or the <a class="reference internal" href="#" title="CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;"><code>CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_GENERATE_TEXT_BASED_STUBS</code></a> variable is set to false.</p> </div> <p>For shared library targets, this property is initialized by the value of the <a class="reference internal" href="../variable/cmake_shared_library_enable_exports.html#variable:CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_ENABLE_EXPORTS" title="CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_ENABLE_EXPORTS" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_ENABLE_EXPORTS"><code>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_ENABLE_EXPORTS</code></a> variable, if it is set when the target is created.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
