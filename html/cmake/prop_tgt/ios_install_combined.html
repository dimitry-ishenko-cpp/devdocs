Universal binaries can only differentiate code based on CPU type, so this only made sense before the days of arm64 macOS machines (i.e. iOS Simulator/arm64). Apple now recommends xcframeworks, which contain multiple binaries for different platforms, for this use case.</p> </div> <p>Build a combined (device and simulator) target when installing.</p> <p>When this property is set to false, which is the default, then it will either be built with the device SDK or the simulator SDK depending on the SDK set.
