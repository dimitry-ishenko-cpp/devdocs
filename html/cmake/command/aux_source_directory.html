<h1 id="command:aux_source_directory">aux_source_directory</h1> <p>Find all source files in a directory.</p> <pre data-language="cmake">aux_source_directory(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)
</pre> <p>Collects the names of all the source files in the specified directory and stores the list in the <code>&lt;variable&gt;</code> provided. This command is intended to be used by projects that use explicit template instantiation. Template instantiation files can be stored in a <code>Templates</code> subdirectory and collected automatically using this command to avoid manually listing all instantiations.</p> <p>It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source files for a library or executable target. While this seems to work, there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a new source file has been added. Normally the generated build system knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file is modified to add a new source. When the source is just added to the directory without modifying this file, one would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new file.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
