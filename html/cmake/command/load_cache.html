<h1 id="command:load_cache">load_cache</h1> <p>Load in the values from another project's CMake cache.</p> <pre data-language="cmake">load_cache(pathToBuildDirectory READ_WITH_PREFIX prefix entry1...)
</pre> <p>Reads the cache and store the requested entries in variables with their name prefixed with the given prefix. This only reads the values, and does not create entries in the local project's cache.</p> <pre data-language="cmake">load_cache(pathToBuildDirectory [EXCLUDE entry1...]
           [INCLUDE_INTERNALS entry1...])
</pre> <p>Loads in the values from another cache and store them in the local project's cache as internal entries. This is useful for a project that depends on another project built in a different tree. <code>EXCLUDE</code> option can be used to provide a list of entries to be excluded. <code>INCLUDE_INTERNALS</code> can be used to provide a list of internal entries to be included. Normally, no internal entries are brought in. Use of this form of the command is strongly discouraged, but it is provided for backward compatibility.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
