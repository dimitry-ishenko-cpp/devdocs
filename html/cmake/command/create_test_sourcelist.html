</pre> <p>A test driver is a program that links together many small tests into a single executable. This is useful when building static executables with large libraries to shrink the total required size. The list of source files needed to build the test driver will be in <code>sourceListName</code>. <code>driverName</code> is the name of the test driver program. The rest of the arguments consist of a list of test source files, can be semicolon separated. Each test source file should have a function in it that is the same name as the file with no extension (foo.cxx should have int foo(int, char*[]);) <code>driverName</code> will be able to call each of the tests by name on the command line. If <code>EXTRA_INCLUDE</code> is specified, then the next argument is included into the generated file. If <code>FUNCTION</code> is specified, then the next argument is taken as a function name that is passed a pointer to ac and av. This can be used to add extra command line processing to each test. The <code>CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN</code> cmake variable can be set to have code that will be placed directly before calling the test main function. <code>CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN</code> can be set to have code that will be placed directly after the call to the test main function.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
