</pre> <p>Sets the advanced/non-advanced state of the named cached variables.</p> <p>An advanced variable will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs unless the <code>show advanced</code> option is on. In script mode, the advanced/non-advanced state has no effect.</p> <p>If the keyword <code>CLEAR</code> is given then advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced. If the keyword <code>FORCE</code> is given then the variables are made advanced. If neither <code>FORCE</code> nor <code>CLEAR</code> is specified, new values will be marked as advanced, but if a variable already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be changed.</p> <div class="versionchanged"> <p><span class="versionmodified changed">Changed in version 3.17: </span>Variables passed to this command which are not already in the cache are ignored.
