Its value will be set to one of the supported values of the corresponding <a class="reference internal" href="#" title="&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD" id="index-0-prop_tgt:&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD"><code>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</code></a> target property; see the documentation of that property for a list of supported languages.</p> <p>See the <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-compile-features.7.html#manual:cmake-compile-features(7)" title="cmake-compile-features(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-compile-features(7)"><code>cmake-compile-features(7)</code></a> manual for information on compile features and a list of supported compilers.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p><code>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_LATEST</code> will never be set to a language standard which CMake recognizes but provides no support for. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, every value which is supported by the corresponding <a class="reference internal" href="#" title="&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD" id="index-1-prop_tgt:&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD"><code>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</code></a> target property represents a standard of language <code>&lt;LANG&gt;</code> which is both recognized and supported by CMake.</p> </div>  <h2>Checking for Language Standard Support</h2> <p>It is possible to use the value of the <code>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_LATEST</code> variable to check for language standard support. This can be used to, e.g., conditionally enable optional features for a distributed library.</p> <p>When doing so, one should be careful to <strong>not</strong> rely on integer value comparisons between standard levels. This is because some older standards of a given language which are supported by CMake (e.g., C++98, represented as <code>98</code>) will have a higher numerical value than newer standards of that same language.</p> <p>The following code sample demonstrates how one might correctly check for C++17 support:</p> <pre data-language="cmake"># Careful! We cannot do direct integer comparisons with
# CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LATEST because some earlier C++ standards (e.g.,
# C++98) will have a higher numerical value than our requirement (C++17).
#
# Instead, we keep a list of unsupported C++ standards and check if
# CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LATEST appears in that list.
set(UNSUPPORTED_CXX_STANDARDS
  98
  11
  14
)

list(FIND UNSUPPORTED_CXX_STANDARDS ${CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LATEST} UNSUPPORTED_CXX_STANDARDS_INDEX)

if(UNSUPPORTED_CXX_STANDARDS_INDEX EQUAL -1)
  # We know that the current compiler supports at least C++17. Enabling
  # some optional feature...
else()
  message(STATUS
    "Feature X is disabled because it requires C++17, but the current "
    "compiler only supports C++${CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LATEST}."
