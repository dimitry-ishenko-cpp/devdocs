<h1 id="variable:CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING">CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</h1> <p>This variable is set by CMake to indicate whether it is cross compiling, but note limitations discussed below.</p> <p>This variable will be set to true by CMake if the <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_system_name.html#variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME" title="CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME"><code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code></a> variable has been set manually (i.e. in a toolchain file or as a cache entry from the <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)" title="cmake(1)" id="index-0-manual:cmake(1)"><code>cmake</code></a> command line). In most cases, manually setting <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_system_name.html#variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME" title="CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME" id="index-1-variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME"><code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code></a> will only be done when cross compiling since, if not manually set, it will be given the same value as <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_host_system_name.html#variable:CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME" title="CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME"><code>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME</code></a>, which is correct for the non-cross-compiling case. In the event that <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_system_name.html#variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME" title="CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME" id="index-2-variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME"><code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code></a> is manually set to the same value as <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_host_system_name.html#variable:CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME" title="CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME" id="index-1-variable:CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME"><code>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME</code></a>, then <code>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</code> will still be set to true.</p> <p>Another case to be aware of is that builds targeting Apple platforms other than macOS are handled differently to other cross compiling scenarios. Rather than relying on <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_system_name.html#variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME" title="CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME" id="index-3-variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME"><code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code></a> to select the target platform, Apple device builds use <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_osx_sysroot.html#variable:CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT" title="CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT"><code>CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</code></a> to select the appropriate SDK, which indirectly determines the target platform. Furthermore, when using the <a class="reference internal" href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Xcode.html#generator:Xcode" title="Xcode" id="index-0-generator:Xcode"><code>Xcode</code></a> generator, developers can switch between device and simulator builds at build time rather than having a single choice at configure time, so the concept of whether the build is cross compiling or not is more complex. Therefore, the use of <code>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</code> is not recommended for projects targeting Apple devices.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
