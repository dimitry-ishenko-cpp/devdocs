<h1 id="variable:CMAKE_MATCH_&lt;n&gt;">CMAKE_MATCH_&lt;n&gt;</h1> <p>Capture group <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> matched by the last regular expression, for groups 0 through 9. Group 0 is the entire match. Groups 1 through 9 are the subexpressions captured by <code>()</code> syntax.</p> <p>When a regular expression match is used, CMake fills in <code>CMAKE_MATCH_&lt;n&gt;</code> variables with the match contents. The <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_match_count.html#variable:CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT" title="CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT"><code>CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT</code></a> variable holds the number of match expressions when these are filled.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
