<h1 id="variable:CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY">CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY</h1> <p>Don't make the <code>install</code> target depend on the <code>all</code> target.</p> <p>By default, the <code>install</code> target depends on the <code>all</code> target. This has the effect, that when <code>make install</code> is invoked or <code>INSTALL</code> is built, first the <code>all</code> target is built, then the installation starts. If <code>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, this dependency is not created, so the installation process will start immediately, independent from whether the project has been completely built or not.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
