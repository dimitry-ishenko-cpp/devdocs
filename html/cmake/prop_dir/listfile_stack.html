<h1 id="prop_dir:LISTFILE_STACK">LISTFILE_STACK</h1> <p>The current stack of listfiles being processed.</p> <p>This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your CMake scripts. It returns a list of what list files are currently being processed, in order. So if one listfile does an <a class="reference internal" href="../command/include.html#command:include" title="include" id="index-0-command:include"><code>include()</code></a> command then that is effectively pushing the included listfile onto the stack.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
