<h1 id="prop_dir:ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES">ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">Added in version 3.15.</span></p> </div> <p>A <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-language.7.html#cmake-language-lists"><span class="std std-ref">;-list</span></a> of files or directories that will be removed as a part of the global <code>clean</code> target. It is useful for specifying generated files or directories that are used by multiple targets or by CMake itself, or that are generated in ways which cannot be captured as outputs or byproducts of custom commands.</p> <p>If an additional clean file is specific to a single target only, then the <a class="reference internal" href="../prop_tgt/additional_clean_files.html#prop_tgt:ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES" title="ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES" id="index-0-prop_tgt:ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES"><code>ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</code></a> target property would usually be a better choice than this directory property.</p> <p>Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted relative to the current binary directory.</p> <p>Contents of <code>ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</code> may use <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html#manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)" title="cmake-generator-expressions(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)"><code>generator expressions</code></a>.</p> <p>This property only works for the <a class="reference internal" href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Ninja.html#generator:Ninja" title="Ninja" id="index-0-generator:Ninja"><code>Ninja</code></a> and the Makefile generators. It is ignored by other generators.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
