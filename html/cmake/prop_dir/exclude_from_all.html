<h1 id="prop_dir:EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL">EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</h1> <p>Set this directory property to a true value on a subdirectory to exclude its targets from the "all" target of its ancestors. If excluded, running e.g. <code>make</code> in the parent directory will not build targets the subdirectory by default. This does not affect the "all" target of the subdirectory itself. Running e.g. <code>make</code> inside the subdirectory will still build its targets.</p> <p><code>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</code> is meant for when the subdirectory contains a separate part of the project that is useful, but not necessary, such as a set of examples, or e.g. an integrated 3rd party library. Typically the subdirectory should contain its own <a class="reference internal" href="../command/project.html#command:project" title="project" id="index-0-command:project"><code>project()</code></a> command invocation so that a full build system will be generated in the subdirectory (such as a Visual Studio IDE solution file). Note that inter-target dependencies supersede this exclusion. If a target built by the parent project depends on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee target will be included in the parent project build system to satisfy the dependency.</p> <p>If the <code>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</code> argument is provided, it has the following effects:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Targets defined in the subdirectory or below will not be included in the <code>ALL</code> target of the parent directory. Those targets must be built explicitly by the user, or be a dependency of another target that will be built.</li> <li>Targets defined in the subdirectory or below will be excluded from IDE project files.</li> <li>Any install rules defined in the subdirectory or below will be ignored when installing the parent directory.</li> </ul> <p>Note that these effects are not the same as those for the <a class="reference internal" href="../prop_tgt/exclude_from_all.html#prop_tgt:EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL" title="EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL" id="index-0-prop_tgt:EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL"><code>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</code></a> target property.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
