<h1 id="module:FindRTI">FindRTI</h1> <p>Try to find M&amp;S HLA RTI libraries</p> <p>This module finds if any HLA RTI is installed and locates the standard RTI include files and libraries.</p> <p>RTI is a simulation infrastructure standardized by IEEE and SISO. It has a well defined C++ API that assures that simulation applications are independent on a particular RTI implementation.</p> <pre data-language="none">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-Time_Infrastructure_(simulation)
</pre> <p>This code sets the following variables:</p> <pre data-language="none">RTI_INCLUDE_DIR = the directory where RTI includes file are found
RTI_LIBRARIES = The libraries to link against to use RTI
RTI_DEFINITIONS = -DRTI_USES_STD_FSTREAM
RTI_FOUND = Set to FALSE if any HLA RTI was not found
