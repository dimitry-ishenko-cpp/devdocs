<h1 id="module:SquishTestScript">SquishTestScript</h1> <p>This script launches a GUI test using Squish. You should not call the script directly; instead, you should access it via the SQUISH_ADD_TEST macro that is defined in FindSquish.cmake.</p> <p>This script starts the Squish server, launches the test on the client, and finally stops the squish server. If any of these steps fail (including if the tests do not pass) then a fatal error is raised.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
