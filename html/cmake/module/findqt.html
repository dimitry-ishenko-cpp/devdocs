If not, you should just directly use FindQt4 or FindQt3. If multiple versions of Qt are found on the machine, then The user must set the option DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the version they want to use. If only one version of qt is found on the machine, then the DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the matching FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included. Once the user sets DESIRED_QT_VERSION, then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included.</p> <pre data-language="none">QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can
            not find Qt4 or Qt3 an error is raised
            and a message is sent to the user.

QT4_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt4 is found.
QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt3 is found.
