</pre> <p>Ice component libraries are reported in:</p> <pre data-language="none">Ice_&lt;C&gt;_FOUND - ON if component was found
Ice_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARIES - libraries for component
</pre> <p>Note that <code>&lt;C&gt;</code> is the uppercased name of the component.</p> <p>This module reads hints about search results from:</p> <pre data-language="none">Ice_HOME - the root of the Ice installation
</pre> <p>The environment variable <code>ICE_HOME</code> may also be used; the Ice_HOME variable takes precedence.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>On Windows, Ice 3.7.0 and later provide libraries via the NuGet package manager. Appropriate NuGet packages will be searched for using <code>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</code>, or alternatively <code>Ice_HOME</code> may be set to the location of a specific NuGet package to restrict the search.</p> </div> <p>The following cache variables may also be set:</p> <pre data-language="none">Ice_&lt;P&gt;_EXECUTABLE - the path to executable &lt;P&gt;
Ice_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing the Ice headers
Ice_SLICE_DIR - the directory containing the Ice slice interface
                definitions
Ice_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY - the library for component &lt;C&gt;
</pre> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>In most cases none of the above variables will require setting, unless multiple Ice versions are available and a specific version is required. On Windows, the most recent version of Ice will be found through the registry. On Unix, the programs, headers and libraries will usually be in standard locations, but Ice_SLICE_DIRS might not be automatically detected (commonly known locations are searched). All the other variables are defaulted using Ice_HOME, if set. It's possible to set Ice_HOME and selectively specify alternative locations for the other components; this might be required for e.g. newer versions of Visual Studio if the heuristics are not sufficient to identify the correct programs and libraries for the specific Visual Studio version.</p> </div> <p>Other variables one may set to control this module are:</p> <pre data-language="none">Ice_DEBUG - Set to ON to enable debug output from FindIce.
