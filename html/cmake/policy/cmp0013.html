<h1 id="policy:CMP0013">CMP0013</h1> <p>Duplicate binary directories are not allowed.</p> <p>CMake 2.6.3 and below silently permitted add_subdirectory() calls to create the same binary directory multiple times. During build system generation files would be written and then overwritten in the build tree and could lead to strange behavior. CMake 2.6.4 and above explicitly detect duplicate binary directories. CMake 2.6.4 always considers this case an error. In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines whether or not the case is an error. The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy is to allow duplicate binary directories. The NEW behavior for this policy is to disallow duplicate binary directories with an error.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0. It may be set by <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_minimum_required.html#command:cmake_minimum_required" title="cmake_minimum_required" id="index-0-command:cmake_minimum_required"><code>cmake_minimum_required()</code></a>. If it is not set, CMake warns, and uses <code>OLD</code> behavior.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
