<h1 id="policy:CMP0132">CMP0132</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">Added in version 3.24.</span></p> </div> <p>Do not set compiler environment variables on first run.</p> <p>Apart from when using the Xcode generator and some Visual Studio generators, CMake 3.23 and below will set environment variables like <a class="reference internal" href="../envvar/cc.html#envvar:CC" title="CC" id="index-0-envvar:CC"><code>CC</code></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../envvar/cxx.html#envvar:CXX" title="CXX" id="index-0-envvar:CXX"><code>CXX</code></a>, etc. when the corresponding language is enabled. This only occurs on the very first time CMake is run in a build directory, and the environment variables are only defined at configure time, not build time. On subsequent CMake runs, these environment variables are not set, opening up the opportunity for different behavior between the first and subsequent CMake runs. CMake 3.24 and above prefer to not set these environment variables when a language is enabled, even on the first run in a build directory.</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy sets the relevant environment variable on the first run when a language is enabled. The <code>NEW</code> behavior for this policy does not set any such environment variables.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.24. It may be set by <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_minimum_required.html#command:cmake_minimum_required" title="cmake_minimum_required" id="index-0-command:cmake_minimum_required"><code>cmake_minimum_required()</code></a>. If it is not set, CMake does <em>not</em> warn, and uses <code>OLD</code> behavior.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
