<h1 id="policy:CMP0008">CMP0008</h1> <p>Libraries linked by full-path must have a valid library file name.</p> <p>In CMake 2.4 and below it is possible to write code like</p> <pre data-language="none">target_link_libraries(myexe /full/path/to/somelib)
</pre> <p>where <code>somelib</code> is supposed to be a valid library file name such as <code>libsomelib.a</code> or <code>somelib.lib</code>. For Makefile generators this produces an error at build time because the dependency on the full path cannot be found. For <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-generators.7.html#visual-studio-generators"><span class="std std-ref">Visual Studio Generators</span></a> IDE and <a class="reference internal" href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Xcode.html#generator:Xcode" title="Xcode" id="index-0-generator:Xcode"><code>Xcode</code></a> generators this used to work by accident because CMake would always split off the library directory and ask the linker to search for the library by name (<code>-lsomelib</code> or <code>somelib.lib</code>). Despite the failure with Makefiles, some projects have code like this and build only with Visual Studio and/or Xcode. This version of CMake prefers to pass the full path directly to the native build tool, which will fail in this case because it does not name a valid library file.</p> <p>This policy determines what to do with full paths that do not appear to name a valid library file. The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy is to split the library name from the path and ask the linker to search for it. The <code>NEW</code> behavior for this policy is to trust the given path and pass it directly to the native build tool unchanged.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.1. It may be set by <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_minimum_required.html#command:cmake_minimum_required" title="cmake_minimum_required" id="index-0-command:cmake_minimum_required"><code>cmake_minimum_required()</code></a>. If it is not set, CMake warns, and uses <code>OLD</code> behavior.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
