<h1 id="policy:CMP0001">CMP0001</h1> <p><code>CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY</code> should no longer be used.</p> <p>The behavior is to check <code>CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY</code> and present it to the user. The <code>NEW</code> behavior is to ignore CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY completely.</p> <p>In CMake 2.4 and below the variable <code>CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY</code> was used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake. In CMake 2.6 and above all compatibility issues are handled by policies and the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> command. However, CMake must still check <code>CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY</code> for projects written for CMake 2.4 and below.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake version 3.26.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses <code>OLD</code> behavior. Use the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-1-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> command to set it to <code>OLD</code> or <code>NEW</code> explicitly.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
