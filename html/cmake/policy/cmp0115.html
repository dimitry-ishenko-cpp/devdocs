<h1 id="policy:CMP0115">CMP0115</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">Added in version 3.20.</span></p> </div> <p>Source file extensions must be explicit.</p> <p>In CMake 3.19 and below, if a source file could not be found by the name specified, it would append a list of known extensions to the name to see if the file with the extension could be found. For example, this would allow the user to run:</p> <pre data-language="cmake">add_executable(exe main)
</pre> <p>and put <code>main.c</code> in the executable without specifying the extension.</p> <p>Starting in CMake 3.20, CMake prefers all source files to have their extensions explicitly listed:</p> <pre data-language="cmake">add_executable(exe main.c)
</pre> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy is to implicitly append known extensions to source files if they can't be found. The <code>NEW</code> behavior of this policy is to not append known extensions and require them to be explicit.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.20. It may be set by <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_minimum_required.html#command:cmake_minimum_required" title="cmake_minimum_required" id="index-0-command:cmake_minimum_required"><code>cmake_minimum_required()</code></a>. If it is not set, CMake warns, and uses <code>OLD</code> behavior.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
