<h1 id="policy:CMP0124">CMP0124</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 3.21.</span></p> </div> <p>When this policy is set to <code>NEW</code>, the scope of loop variables defined by the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/foreach.html#command:foreach" title="foreach" id="index-0-command:foreach"><code>foreach()</code></a> command is restricted to the loop only. They will be unset at the end of the loop.</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy still clears the loop variables at the end of the loop, but does not unset them. This leaves them as defined, but empty.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.21. Use the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> command to set it to <code>OLD</code> or <code>NEW</code> explicitly. Unlike many policies, CMake version 3.26.0-rc3 does <em>not</em> warn when the policy is not set and simply uses <code>OLD</code> behavior.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
