More info: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/">https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>nodeName</strong> (string)</p>
<p>NodeName is a request to schedule this pod onto a specific node. If it is non-empty, the scheduler simply schedules this pod onto that node, assuming that it fits resource requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>affinity</strong> (Affinity)</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tolerations</strong> ([]Toleration)</p>
<p>If specified, the pod's tolerations.</p>
<p><em>The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches the triple &lt;key,value,effect&gt; using the matching operator <operator>.</operator></em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>tolerations.key</strong> (string)</p>
<p>Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tolerations.operator</strong> (string)</p>
<p>Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tolerations.value</strong> (string)</p>
<p>Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tolerations.effect</strong> (string)</p>
<p>Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tolerations.tolerationSeconds</strong> (int64)</p>
<p>TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>schedulerName</strong> (string)</p>
<p>If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>runtimeClassName</strong> (string)</p>
<p>RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod. If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy" RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: <a href="https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class">https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>priorityClassName</strong> (string)</p>
<p>If specified, indicates the pod's priority. "system-node-critical" and "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>priority</strong> (int32)</p>
<p>The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>preemptionPolicy</strong> (string)</p>
<p>PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower priority. One of Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if unset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>topologySpreadConstraints</strong> ([]TopologySpreadConstraint)</p>
<p><em>Patch strategy: merge on key <code>topologyKey</code></em></p>
<p><em>Map: unique values on keys <code>topologyKey, whenUnsatisfiable</code> will be kept during a merge</em></p>
<p>TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods ought to spread across topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way which abides by the constraints. All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed.</p>
<p><em>TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given topology.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>topologySpreadConstraints.maxSkew</strong> (int32), required</p>
<p>MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When <code>whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule</code>, it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When <code>whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway</code>, it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>topologySpreadConstraints.topologyKey</strong> (string), required</p>
<p>TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each &lt;key, value&gt; as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>topologySpreadConstraints.whenUnsatisfiable</strong> (string), required</p>
<p>WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P | P | P | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it <em>more</em> imbalanced. It's a required field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>topologySpreadConstraints.labelSelector</strong> (<a href="../../common-definitions/label-selector/index.html#LabelSelector">LabelSelector</a>)</p>
<p>LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>topologySpreadConstraints.matchLabelKeys</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.</p>
<p>This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>topologySpreadConstraints.minDomains</strong> (int32)</p>
<p>MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.</p>
<p>For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P P | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.</p>
<p>This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>topologySpreadConstraints.nodeAffinityPolicy</strong> (string)</p>
<p>NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.</p>
<p>If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>topologySpreadConstraints.nodeTaintsPolicy</strong> (string)</p>
<p>NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.</p>
<p>If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>overhead</strong> (map[string]<a href="../../common-definitions/quantity/index.html#Quantity">Quantity</a>)</p>
<p>Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a given RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the RuntimeClass admission controller. If the RuntimeClass admission controller is enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>terminationGracePeriodSeconds</strong> (int64)</p>
<p>Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>activeDeadlineSeconds</strong> (int64)</p>
<p>Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node relative to StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and kill associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>readinessGates</strong> ([]PodReadinessGate)</p>
<p>If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness. A pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in the readiness gates have status equal to "True" More info: <a href="https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/580-pod-readiness-gates">https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/580-pod-readiness-gates</a></p>

If a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination grace period is reached.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>terminationMessagePath</strong> (string)</p>
<p>Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>terminationMessagePolicy</strong> (string)</p>
<p>Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>livenessProbe</strong> (<a href="index.html#Probe">Probe</a>)</p>
<p>Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe fails. Cannot be updated.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>startupProbe</strong> (<a href="index.html#Probe">Probe</a>)</p>
<p>StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>restartPolicy</strong> (string)</p>
<p>RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod. This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always". For non-init containers or when this field is not specified, the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect: this init container will be continually restarted on exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always" will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed.</p>

<p><strong>phase</strong> (string)</p>
<p>The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle. The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status arrays contain more detail about the pod's status. There are five possible phase values:</p>
<p>Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while. Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.</p>
