<p><strong>spec.auditAnnotations</strong> ([]AuditAnnotation)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>auditAnnotations contains CEL expressions which are used to produce audit annotations for the audit event of the API request. validations and auditAnnotations may not both be empty; a least one of validations or auditAnnotations is required.</p>
<p><em>AuditAnnotation describes how to produce an audit annotation for an API request.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.auditAnnotations.key</strong> (string), required</p>
<p>key specifies the audit annotation key. The audit annotation keys of a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy must be unique. The key must be a qualified name ([A-Za-z0-9][-A-Za-z0-9_.]*) no more than 63 bytes in length.</p>
<p>The key is combined with the resource name of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy to construct an audit annotation key: "{ValidatingAdmissionPolicy name}/{key}".</p>
<p>If an admission webhook uses the same resource name as this ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and the same audit annotation key, the annotation key will be identical. In this case, the first annotation written with the key will be included in the audit event and all subsequent annotations with the same key will be discarded.</p>
<p>Required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.auditAnnotations.valueExpression</strong> (string), required</p>
<p>valueExpression represents the expression which is evaluated by CEL to produce an audit annotation value. The expression must evaluate to either a string or null value. If the expression evaluates to a string, the audit annotation is included with the string value. If the expression evaluates to null or empty string the audit annotation will be omitted. The valueExpression may be no longer than 5kb in length. If the result of the valueExpression is more than 10kb in length, it will be truncated to 10kb.</p>
<p>If multiple ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding resources match an API request, then the valueExpression will be evaluated for each binding. All unique values produced by the valueExpressions will be joined together in a comma-separated list.</p>
<p>Required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.failurePolicy</strong> (string)</p>
<p>failurePolicy defines how to handle failures for the admission policy. Failures can occur from CEL expression parse errors, type check errors, runtime errors and invalid or mis-configured policy definitions or bindings.</p>
<p>A policy is invalid if spec.paramKind refers to a non-existent Kind. A binding is invalid if spec.paramRef.name refers to a non-existent resource.</p>
<p>failurePolicy does not define how validations that evaluate to false are handled.</p>
<p>When failurePolicy is set to Fail, ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding validationActions define how failures are enforced.</p>
<p>Allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Fail.</p>

<p><em>Patch strategy: merge on key <code>name</code></em></p>
<p><em>Map: unique values on key name will be kept during a merge</em></p>
<p>MatchConditions is a list of conditions that must be met for a request to be validated. Match conditions filter requests that have already been matched by the rules, namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of matchConditions matches all requests. There are a maximum of 64 match conditions allowed.</p>
<p>If a parameter object is provided, it can be accessed via the <code>params</code> handle in the same manner as validation expressions.</p>
<p>The exact matching logic is (in order):</p>
<ol>
<li>If ANY matchCondition evaluates to FALSE, the policy is skipped.</li>
<li>If ALL matchConditions evaluate to TRUE, the policy is evaluated.</li>
<li>If any matchCondition evaluates to an error (but none are FALSE):<ul>
<li>If failurePolicy=Fail, reject the request</li>
<li>If failurePolicy=Ignore, the policy is skipped</li>
</ul>

<p>Required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints</strong> (MatchResources)</p>
<p>MatchConstraints specifies what resources this policy is designed to validate. The AdmissionPolicy cares about a request if it matches <em>all</em> Constraints. However, in order to prevent clusters from being put into an unstable state that cannot be recovered from via the API ValidatingAdmissionPolicy cannot match ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding. Required.</p>
<p><em>MatchResources decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether it meets the match criteria. The exclude rules take precedence over include rules (if a resource matches both, it is excluded)</em></p>

<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>ExcludeResourceRules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy should not care about. The exclude rules take precedence over include rules (if a resource matches both, it is excluded)</p>
<p><em>NamedRuleWithOperations is a tuple of Operations and Resources with ResourceNames.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.excludeResourceRules.apiGroups</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>APIGroups is the API groups the resources belong to. '<em>' is all groups. If '</em>' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.excludeResourceRules.resourceNames</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>ResourceNames is an optional white list of names that the rule applies to. An empty set means that everything is allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.excludeResourceRules.resources</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.</p>
<p>For example: 'pods' means pods. 'pods/log' means the log subresource of pods. '<em>' means all resources, but not subresources. 'pods/</em>' means all subresources of pods. '<em>/scale' means all scale subresources. '</em>/*' means all resources and their subresources.</p>
<p>If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not overlap with each other.</p>
<p>Depending on the enclosing object, subresources might not be allowed. Required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.excludeResourceRules.scope</strong> (string)</p>
<p>scope specifies the scope of this rule. Valid values are "Cluster", "Namespaced", and "<em>" "Cluster" means that only cluster-scoped resources will match this rule. Namespace API objects are cluster-scoped. "Namespaced" means that only namespaced resources will match this rule. "</em>" means that there are no scope restrictions. Subresources match the scope of their parent resource. Default is "*".</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.matchPolicy</strong> (string)</p>
<p>matchPolicy defines how the "MatchResources" list is used to match incoming requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included <code>apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]</code>, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.</p></li>
<li><p>Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included <code>apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]</code>, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Defaults to "Equivalent"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.namespaceSelector</strong> (<a href="../../common-definitions/label-selector/index.html#LabelSelector">LabelSelector</a>)</p>
<p>NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the policy.</p>
<p>For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "runlevel", "operator": "NotIn", "values": [ "0", "1" ] } ] }</p>
<p>If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "environment", "operator": "In", "values": [ "prod", "staging" ] } ] }</p>
<p>See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/">https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/</a> for more examples of label selectors.</p>
<p>Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.objectSelector</strong> (<a href="../../common-definitions/label-selector/index.html#LabelSelector">LabelSelector</a>)</p>
<p>ObjectSelector decides whether to run the validation based on if the object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the cel validation, and is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.</p>

<p>ParamKind specifies the kind of resources used to parameterize this policy. If absent, there are no parameters for this policy and the param CEL variable will not be provided to validation expressions.

</ul>
<p>The <code>apiVersion</code>, <code>kind</code>, <code>metadata.name</code> and <code>metadata.generateName</code> are always accessible from the root of the object. No other metadata properties are accessible.</p>
<p>Only property names of the form <code>[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*</code> are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '<strong>' escapes to '<strong>underscores</strong>' - '.' escapes to '<strong>dot</strong>' - '-' escapes to '<strong>dash</strong>' - '/' escapes to '<strong>slash</strong>' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '</strong>{keyword}__'. The keywords are: "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if", "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return". Examples:</p>
<ul>

<p>Equality on arrays with list type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:</p>
<ul>
<li>'set': <code>X + Y</code> performs a union where the array positions of all elements in <code>X</code> are preserved and non-intersecting elements in <code>Y</code> are appended, retaining their partial order.</li>
<li>'map': <code>X + Y</code> performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in <code>X</code> are preserved but the values are overwritten by values in <code>Y</code> when the key sets of <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> intersect.

The message must not contain line breaks. If unset, the message is "failed Expression: {Expression}".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.validations.messageExpression</strong> (string)</p>
<p>messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails. Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string. If both message and messageExpression are present on a validation, then messageExpression will be used if validation fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the runtime error is logged, and the validation failure message is produced as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset, and the fact that messageExpression produced an empty string/string with only spaces/string with line breaks will be logged. messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the <code>expression</code> except for 'authorizer' and 'authorizer.requestResource'. Example: "object.x must be less than max ("+string(params.max)+")"</p>
</li>
<li>

<h2 id="ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding">ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding</h2>
<p>ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding binds the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy with paramerized resources. ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding and parameter CRDs together define how cluster administrators configure policies for clusters.</p>
<p>For a given admission request, each binding will cause its policy to be evaluated N times, where N is 1 for policies/bindings that don't use params, otherwise N is the number of parameters selected by the binding.</p>
<p>The CEL expressions of a policy must have a computed CEL cost below the maximum CEL budget. Each evaluation of the policy is given an independent CEL cost budget. Adding/removing policies, bindings, or params can not affect whether a given (policy, binding, param) combination is within its own CEL budget.</p>

<p><strong>spec</strong> (ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBindingSpec)</p>
<p>Specification of the desired behavior of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding.</p>
<p><em>ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBindingSpec is the specification of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources</strong> (MatchResources)</p>
<p>MatchResources declares what resources match this binding and will be validated by it. Note that this is intersected with the policy's matchConstraints, so only requests that are matched by the policy can be selected by this. If this is unset, all resources matched by the policy are validated by this binding When resourceRules is unset, it does not constrain resource matching. If a resource is matched by the other fields of this object, it will be validated. Note that this is differs from ValidatingAdmissionPolicy matchConstraints, where resourceRules are required.</p>
<p><em>MatchResources decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether it meets the match criteria. The exclude rules take precedence over include rules (if a resource matches both, it is excluded)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.excludeResourceRules</strong> ([]NamedRuleWithOperations)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>ExcludeResourceRules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy should not care about. The exclude rules take precedence over include rules (if a resource matches both, it is excluded)</p>
<p><em>NamedRuleWithOperations is a tuple of Operations and Resources with ResourceNames.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.excludeResourceRules.apiGroups</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>APIGroups is the API groups the resources belong to. '<em>' is all groups. If '</em>' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.excludeResourceRules.apiVersions</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>APIVersions is the API versions the resources belong to. '<em>' is all versions. If '</em>' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.excludeResourceRules.operations</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>Operations is the operations the admission hook cares about - CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, CONNECT or * for all of those operations and any future admission operations that are added. If '*' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.excludeResourceRules.resourceNames</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>ResourceNames is an optional white list of names that the rule applies to. An empty set means that everything is allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.excludeResourceRules.resources</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.</p>
<p>For example: 'pods' means pods. 'pods/log' means the log subresource of pods. '<em>' means all resources, but not subresources. 'pods/</em>' means all subresources of pods. '<em>/scale' means all scale subresources. '</em>/*' means all resources and their subresources.</p>
<p>If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not overlap with each other.</p>
<p>Depending on the enclosing object, subresources might not be allowed. Required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.excludeResourceRules.scope</strong> (string)</p>
<p>scope specifies the scope of this rule. Valid values are "Cluster", "Namespaced", and "<em>" "Cluster" means that only cluster-scoped resources will match this rule. Namespace API objects are cluster-scoped. "Namespaced" means that only namespaced resources will match this rule. "</em>" means that there are no scope restrictions. Subresources match the scope of their parent resource. Default is "*".</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.matchPolicy</strong> (string)</p>
<p>matchPolicy defines how the "MatchResources" list is used to match incoming requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included <code>apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]</code>, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.</p></li>
<li><p>Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included <code>apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]</code>, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Defaults to "Equivalent"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.namespaceSelector</strong> (<a href="../../common-definitions/label-selector/index.html#LabelSelector">LabelSelector</a>)</p>
<p>NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the policy.</p>
<p>For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "runlevel", "operator": "NotIn", "values": [ "0", "1" ] } ] }</p>
<p>If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "environment", "operator": "In", "values": [ "prod", "staging" ] } ] }</p>
<p>See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/">https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/</a> for more examples of label selectors.</p>
<p>Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.objectSelector</strong> (<a href="../../common-definitions/label-selector/index.html#LabelSelector">LabelSelector</a>)</p>
<p>ObjectSelector decides whether to run the validation based on if the object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the cel validation, and is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.resourceRules</strong> ([]NamedRuleWithOperations)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>ResourceRules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy matches. The policy cares about an operation if it matches <em>any</em> Rule.</p>
<p><em>NamedRuleWithOperations is a tuple of Operations and Resources with ResourceNames.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.resourceRules.apiGroups</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>APIGroups is the API groups the resources belong to. '<em>' is all groups. If '</em>' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.resourceRules.apiVersions</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>APIVersions is the API versions the resources belong to. '<em>' is all versions. If '</em>' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.resourceRules.resources</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.paramRef</strong> (ParamRef)</p>
<p>paramRef specifies the parameter resource used to configure the admission control policy. It should point to a resource of the type specified in ParamKind of the bound ValidatingAdmissionPolicy. If the policy specifies a ParamKind and the resource referred to by ParamRef does not exist, this binding is considered mis-configured and the FailurePolicy of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy applied. If the policy does not specify a ParamKind then this field is ignored, and the rules are evaluated without a param.</p>
<p><em>ParamRef describes how to locate the params to be used as input to expressions of rules applied by a policy binding.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.paramRef.name</strong> (string)</p>
<p>name is the name of the resource being referenced.</p>
<p>One of <code>name</code> or <code>selector</code> must be set, but <code>name</code> and <code>selector</code> are mutually exclusive properties. If one is set, the other must be unset.</p>
<p>A single parameter used for all admission requests can be configured by setting the <code>name</code> field, leaving <code>selector</code> blank, and setting namespace if <code>paramKind</code> is namespace-scoped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.paramRef.namespace</strong> (string)</p>
<p>namespace is the namespace of the referenced resource. Allows limiting the search for params to a specific namespace. Applies to both <code>name</code> and <code>selector</code> fields.</p>
<p>A per-namespace parameter may be used by specifying a namespace-scoped <code>paramKind</code> in the policy and leaving this field empty.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <code>paramKind</code> is cluster-scoped, this field MUST be unset. Setting this field results in a configuration error.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>paramKind</code> is namespace-scoped, the namespace of the object being evaluated for admission will be used when this field is left unset. Take care that if this is left empty the binding must not match any cluster-scoped resources, which will result in an error.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.paramRef.parameterNotFoundAction</strong> (string)</p>
<p><code>parameterNotFoundAction</code> controls the behavior of the binding when the resource exists, and name or selector is valid, but there are no parameters matched by the binding. If the value is set to <code>Allow</code>, then no matched parameters will be treated as successful validation by the binding. If set to <code>Deny</code>, then no matched parameters will be subject to the <code>failurePolicy</code> of the policy.</p>
<p>Allowed values are <code>Allow</code> or <code>Deny</code></p>
<p>Required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.paramRef.selector</strong> (<a href="../../common-definitions/label-selector/index.html#LabelSelector">LabelSelector</a>)</p>
<p>selector can be used to match multiple param objects based on their labels. Supply selector: {} to match all resources of the ParamKind.</p>
<p>If multiple params are found, they are all evaluated with the policy expressions and the results are ANDed together.</p>
<p>One of <code>name</code> or <code>selector</code> must be set, but <code>name</code> and <code>selector</code> are mutually exclusive properties. If one is set, the other must be unset.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.policyName</strong> (string)</p>
<p>PolicyName references a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy name which the ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding binds to. If the referenced resource does not exist, this binding is considered invalid and will be ignored Required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.validationActions</strong> ([]string)</p>
<p><em>Set: unique values will be kept during a merge</em></p>
<p>validationActions declares how Validations of the referenced ValidatingAdmissionPolicy are enforced. If a validation evaluates to false it is always enforced according to these actions.</p>
<p>Failures defined by the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy's FailurePolicy are enforced according to these actions only if the FailurePolicy is set to Fail, otherwise the failures are ignored. This includes compilation errors, runtime errors and misconfigurations of the policy.</p>
<p>validationActions is declared as a set of action values. Order does not matter. validationActions may not contain duplicates of the same action.</p>
<p>The supported actions values are:</p>
<p>"Deny" specifies that a validation failure results in a denied request.</p>
<p>"Warn" specifies that a validation failure is reported to the request client in HTTP Warning headers, with a warning code of 299. Warnings can be sent both for allowed or denied admission responses.</p>
<p>"Audit" specifies that a validation failure is included in the published audit event for the request. The audit event will contain a <code>validation.policy.admission.k8s.io/validation_failure</code> audit annotation with a value containing the details of the validation failures, formatted as a JSON list of objects, each with the following fields: - message: The validation failure message string - policy: The resource name of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy - binding: The resource name of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding - expressionIndex: The index of the failed validations in the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy - validationActions: The enforcement actions enacted for the validation failure Example audit annotation: <code>"validation.policy.admission.k8s.io/validation_failure": "[{"message": "Invalid value", {"policy": "policy.example.com", {"binding": "policybinding.example.com", {"expressionIndex": "1", {"validationActions": ["Audit"]}]"</code></p>
<p>Clients should expect to handle additional values by ignoring any values not recognized.</p>
<p>"Deny" and "Warn" may not be used together since this combination needlessly duplicates the validation failure both in the API response body and the HTTP warning headers.</p>
<p>Required.</p>
