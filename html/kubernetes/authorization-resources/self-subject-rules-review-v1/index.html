<h2 id="SelfSubjectRulesReview">SelfSubjectRulesReview</h2>
<p>SelfSubjectRulesReview enumerates the set of actions the current user can perform within a namespace. The returned list of actions may be incomplete depending on the server's authorization mode, and any errors experienced during the evaluation. SelfSubjectRulesReview should be used by UIs to show/hide actions, or to quickly let an end user reason about their permissions. It should NOT Be used by external systems to drive authorization decisions as this raises confused deputy, cache lifetime/revocation, and correctness concerns. SubjectAccessReview, and LocalAccessReview are the correct way to defer authorization decisions to the API server.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>status</strong> (SubjectRulesReviewStatus)</p>
<p>Status is filled in by the server and indicates the set of actions a user can perform.</p>
<p><em>SubjectRulesReviewStatus contains the result of a rules check. This check can be incomplete depending on the set of authorizers the server is configured with and any errors experienced during evaluation. Because authorization rules are additive, if a rule appears in a list it's safe to assume the subject has that permission, even if that list is incomplete.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>status.incomplete</strong> (boolean), required</p>
<p>Incomplete is true when the rules returned by this call are incomplete. This is most commonly encountered when an authorizer, such as an external authorizer, doesn't support rules evaluation.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>status.evaluationError</strong> (string)</p>
<p>EvaluationError can appear in combination with Rules. It indicates an error occurred during rule evaluation, such as an authorizer that doesn't support rule evaluation, and that ResourceRules and/or NonResourceRules may be incomplete.</p>
