<p><strong>spec.validations</strong> ([]Validation), required</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>
<p>Validations contain CEL expressions which is used to apply the validation. A minimum of one validation is required for a policy definition. Required.</p>
<p> <em>Validation specifies the CEL expression which is used to apply the validation.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.validations.expression</strong> (string), required</p>
<p>Expression represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: <a href="https://github.com/google/cel-spec">https://github.com/google/cel-spec</a> CEL expressions have access to the contents of the Admission request/response, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:</p>
<p>'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. 'request' - Attributes of the admission request(<a href="https://kubernetes.io/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest">ref</a>). 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind.</p>
<p>The <code>apiVersion</code>, <code>kind</code>, <code>metadata.name</code> and <code>metadata.generateName</code> are always accessible from the root of the object. No other metadata properties are accessible.</p>
<p>Only property names of the form <code>[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*</code> are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '<strong>' escapes to '<strong>underscores</strong>' - '.' escapes to '<strong>dot</strong>' - '-' escapes to '<strong>dash</strong>' - '/' escapes to '<strong>slash</strong>' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '</strong>{keyword}__'. The keywords are: "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if", "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return". Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expression accessing a property named "namespace": {"Expression": "object.<strong>namespace</strong> &gt; 0"}</li>
<li>Expression accessing a property named "x-prop": {"Expression": "object.x__dash__prop &gt; 0"}</li>
<li>Expression accessing a property named "redact__d": {"Expression": "object.redact__underscores__d &gt; 0"}</li>
</ul>
<p>Equality on arrays with list type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:</p>
<ul>
<li>'set': <code>X + Y</code> performs a union where the array positions of all elements in <code>X</code> are preserved and non-intersecting elements in <code>Y</code> are appended, retaining their partial order.</li>
<li>'map': <code>X + Y</code> performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in <code>X</code> are preserved but the values are overwritten by values in <code>Y</code> when the key sets of <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> intersect. Elements in <code>Y</code> with non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order. Required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.validations.message</strong> (string)</p>
<p>Message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Expression contains line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks. If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}". e.g. "must be a URL with the host matching spec.host" If the Expression contains line breaks. Message is required. The message must not contain line breaks. If unset, the message is "failed Expression: {Expression}".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.validations.reason</strong> (string)</p>
<p>Reason represents a machine-readable description of why this validation failed. If this is the first validation in the list to fail, this reason, as well as the corresponding HTTP response code, are used in the HTTP response to the client. The currently supported reasons are: "Unauthorized", "Forbidden", "Invalid", "RequestEntityTooLarge". If not set, StatusReasonInvalid is used in the response to the client.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.failurePolicy</strong> (string)</p>

Defaults to Fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints</strong> (MatchResources)</p>
<p>MatchConstraints specifies what resources this policy is designed to validate. The AdmissionPolicy cares about a request if it matches <em>all</em> Constraints.

<p>If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not overlap with each other.</p>
<p>Depending on the enclosing object, subresources might not be allowed. Required.</p>

Subresources match the scope of their parent resource. Default is "*".</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.matchPolicy</strong> (string)</p>
<p>matchPolicy defines how the "MatchResources" list is used to match incoming requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".</p>

For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included <code>apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]</code>, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.</p></li>
<li><p>Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included <code>apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]</code>, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.</p></li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.namespaceSelector</strong> (<a href="../../common-definitions/label-selector/index.html#LabelSelector">LabelSelector</a>)</p>
<p>NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the policy.</p>
<p>For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "runlevel", "operator": "NotIn", "values": [ "0", "1" ] } ] }</p>
<p>If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "environment", "operator": "In", "values": [ "prod", "staging" ] } ] }</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.objectSelector</strong> (<a href="../../common-definitions/label-selector/index.html#LabelSelector">LabelSelector</a>)</p>
<p>ObjectSelector decides whether to run the validation based on if the object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the cel validation, and is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.</p>

<p><strong>spec.matchConstraints.resourceRules</strong> ([]NamedRuleWithOperations)</p>
<p><em>Atomic: will be replaced during a merge</em></p>

<p>If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not overlap with each other.</p>
<p>Depending on the enclosing object, subresources might not be allowed. Required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.matchResources.resourceRules.scope</strong> (string)</p>
<p>scope specifies the scope of this rule. Valid values are "Cluster", "Namespaced", and "<em>" "Cluster" means that only cluster-scoped resources will match this rule. Namespace API objects are cluster-scoped. "Namespaced" means that only namespaced resources will match this rule. "</em>" means that there are no scope restrictions. Subresources match the scope of their parent resource. Default is "*".</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.paramRef</strong> (ParamRef)</p>
<p>ParamRef specifies the parameter resource used to configure the admission control policy. It should point to a resource of the type specified in ParamKind of the bound ValidatingAdmissionPolicy. If the policy specifies a ParamKind and the resource referred to by ParamRef does not exist, this binding is considered mis-configured and the FailurePolicy of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy applied.</p>
<p> <em>ParamRef references a parameter resource</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.paramRef.name</strong> (string)</p>
<p>Name of the resource being referenced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.paramRef.namespace</strong> (string)</p>
<p>Namespace of the referenced resource. Should be empty for the cluster-scoped resources</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spec.policyName</strong> (string)</p>
<p>PolicyName references a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy name which the ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding binds to. If the referenced resource does not exist, this binding is considered invalid and will be ignored Required.</p>
