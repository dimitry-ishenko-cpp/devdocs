<h1>tkwait</h1>  <h2 id="M2">Name</h2> tkwait — Wait for variable to change or window to be destroyed <h2 id="M3">Synopsis</h2> <b>tkwait variable </b><i>name</i><br> <b>tkwait visibility </b><i>name</i><br> <b>tkwait window </b><i>name</i><br> <h2 id="M4">Description</h2> The <b>tkwait</b> command waits for one of several things to happen, then it returns without taking any other actions. The return value is always an empty string. If the first argument is <b>variable</b> (or any abbreviation of it) then the second argument is the name of a global variable and the command waits for that variable to be modified. If the first argument is <b>visibility</b> (or any abbreviation of it) then the second argument is the name of a window and the <b>tkwait</b> command waits for a change in its visibility state (as indicated by the arrival of a VisibilityNotify event). This form is typically used to wait for a newly-created window to appear on the screen before taking some action. If the first argument is <b>window</b> (or any abbreviation of it) then the second argument is the name of a window and the <b>tkwait</b> command waits for that window to be destroyed. This form is typically used to wait for a user to finish interacting with a dialog box before using the result of that interaction. <p> While the <b>tkwait</b> command is waiting it processes events in the normal fashion, so the application will continue to respond to user interactions. If an event handler invokes <b>tkwait</b> again, the nested call to <b>tkwait</b> must complete before the outer call can complete. </p>
