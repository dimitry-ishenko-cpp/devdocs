<h1>try</h1>  <h2 id="M2">Name</h2> try — Trap and process errors and exceptions <h2 id="M3">Synopsis</h2> <b>try</b><i> body</i> ?<i>handler...</i>? ?<b>finally</b><i> script</i>?<br> <h2 id="M4">Description</h2> This command executes the script <i>body</i> and, depending on what the outcome of that script is (normal exit, error, or some other exceptional result), runs a handler script to deal with the case. Once that has all happened, if the <b>finally</b> clause is present, the <i>script</i> it includes will be run and the result of the handler (or the <i>body</i> if no handler matched) is allowed to continue to propagate. Note that the <b>finally</b> clause is processed even if an error occurs and irrespective of which, if any, <i>handler</i> is used. <p> The <i>handler</i> clauses are each expressed as several words, and must have one of the following forms: </p>

<dl class="description"> <dt id="M5">
<b>on </b><i>code variableList script</i>
</dt>
<dd> This clause matches if the evaluation of <i>body</i> completed with the exception code <i>code</i>. The <i>code</i> may be expressed as an integer or one of the following literal words: <b>ok</b>, <b><a href="error.htm.html">error</a></b>, <b><a href="return.htm.html">return</a></b>, <b><a href="break.htm.html">break</a></b>, or <b><a href="continue.htm.html">continue</a></b>. Those literals correspond to the integers 0 through 4 respectively. 
</dd>
<dt id="M6">
<b>trap </b><i>pattern variableList script</i>
</dt>
<dd> This clause matches if the evaluation of <i>body</i> resulted in an error and the prefix of the <b>-errorcode</b> from the interpreter's status dictionary is equal to the <i>pattern</i>. The number of prefix words taken from the <b>-errorcode</b> is equal to the list-length of <i>pattern</i>, and inter-word spaces are normalized in both the <b>-errorcode</b> and <i>pattern</i> before comparison. 
</dd>
</dl> <p> The <i>variableList</i> word in each <i>handler</i> is always interpreted as a list of variable names. If the first word of the list is present and non-empty, it names a variable into which the result of the evaluation of <i>body</i> (from the main <b>try</b>) will be placed; this will contain the human-readable form of any errors. If the second word of the list is present and non-empty, it names a variable into which the options dictionary of the interpreter at the moment of completion of execution of <i>body</i> will be placed. </p>
<p> The <i>script</i> word of each <i>handler</i> is also always interpreted the same: as a Tcl script to evaluate if the clause is matched. If <i>script</i> is a literal “-” and the <i>handler</i> is not the last one, the <i>script</i> of the following <i>handler</i> is invoked instead (just like with the <b><a href="switch.htm.html">switch</a></b> command). </p>
<p> Note that <i>handler</i> clauses are matched against in order, and that the first matching one is always selected. At most one <i>handler</i> clause will selected. As a consequence, an <b>on error</b> will mask any subsequent <b>trap</b> in the <b>try</b>. Also note that <b>on error</b> is equivalent to <b>trap {}</b>. </p>
<p> If an exception (i.e. any non-<b>ok</b> result) occurs during the evaluation of either the <i>handler</i> or the <b>finally</b> clause, the original exception's status dictionary will be added to the new exception's status dictionary under the <b>-during</b> key. </p>
<h2 id="M7">Examples</h2> Ensure that a file is closed no matter what: 
<pre>set f [open /some/file/name a]
<b>try</b> {
    puts $f "some message"
    # ...
} <b>finally</b> {
    close $f
}</pre> <p> Handle different reasons for a file to not be openable for reading: </p>

<pre><b>try</b> {
    set f [open /some/file/name w]
} <b>trap</b> {POSIX EISDIR} {} {
    puts "failed to open /some/file/name: it's a directory"
} <b>trap</b> {POSIX ENOENT} {} {
    puts "failed to open /some/file/name: it doesn't exist"
}</pre> <h2 id="M8">See also</h2> <b><a href="catch.htm.html">catch</a></b>, <b><a href="error.htm.html">error</a></b>, <b><a href="return.htm.html">return</a></b>, <b><a href="throw.htm.html">throw</a></b>   <div class="_attribution"><p class="_attribution-p">Copyright © 2008 Donal K.
