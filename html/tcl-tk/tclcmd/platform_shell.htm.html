<h1>platform_shell</h1>  <h2 id="M2">Name</h2> platform::shell — System identification support code and utilities <h2 id="M3">Synopsis</h2> <b>package require platform::shell ?1.1.4?</b><br> <b>platform::shell::generic </b><i>shell</i><br> <b>platform::shell::identify </b><i>shell</i><br> <b>platform::shell::platform </b><i>shell</i><br> <h2 id="M4">Description</h2> The <b>platform::shell</b> package provides several utility commands useful for the identification of the architecture of a specific Tcl shell. <p> This package allows the identification of the architecture of a specific Tcl shell different from the shell running the package. The only requirement is that the other shell (identified by its path), is actually executable on the current machine. </p>
<p> While for most platform this means that the architecture of the interrogated shell is identical to the architecture of the running shell this is not generally true. A counter example are all platforms which have 32 and 64 bit variants and where a 64bit system is able to run 32bit code. For these running and interrogated shell may have different 32/64 bit settings and thus different identifiers. </p>
<p> For applications like a code repository it is important to identify the architecture of the shell which will actually run the installed packages, versus the architecture of the shell running the repository software. </p>
<h2 id="M5">Commands</h2> <dl class="commands"> <dt id="M6">
<b>platform::shell::identify </b><i>shell</i>
</dt>
<dd> This command does the same identification as <b>platform::identify</b>, for the specified Tcl shell, in contrast to the running shell. 
</dd>
<dt id="M7">
<b>platform::shell::generic </b><i>shell</i>
</dt>
<dd> This command does the same identification as <b>platform::generic</b>, for the specified Tcl shell, in contrast to the running shell. 
</dd>
<dt id="M8">
<b>platform::shell::platform </b><i>shell</i>
</dt>
<dd> This command returns the contents of <b>tcl_platform(platform)</b> for the specified Tcl shell.
