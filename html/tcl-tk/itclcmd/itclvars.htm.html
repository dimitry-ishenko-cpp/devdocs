<h1>itclvars</h1>  <h2 id="M2">Name</h2> itclvars — variables used by [incr Tcl] <h2 id="M3">Description</h2> The following global variables are created and managed automatically by the <b>[incr Tcl]</b> library. Except where noted below, these variables should normally be treated as read-only by application-specific code and by users. 
<dl class="description"> <dt id="M4"><b>itcl::library</b></dt>
<dd> When an interpreter is created, <b>[incr Tcl]</b> initializes this variable to hold the name of a directory containing the system library of <b>[incr Tcl]</b> scripts. The initial value of <b>itcl::library</b> is set from the ITCL_LIBRARY environment variable if it exists, or from a compiled-in value otherwise. 
</dd>
<dt id="M5"><b>itcl::patchLevel</b></dt>
<dd> When an interpreter is created, <b>[incr Tcl]</b> initializes this variable to hold the current patch level for <b>[incr Tcl]</b>. For example, the value "<b>2.0p1</b>" indicates <b>[incr Tcl]</b> version 2.0 with the first set of patches applied. 
</dd>
<dt id="M6"><b>itcl::purist</b></dt>
<dd> When an interpreter is created containing Tcl/Tk and the <b>[incr Tcl]</b> namespace facility, this variable controls a "backward-compatibility" mode for widget access. <p> In vanilla Tcl/Tk, there is a single pool of commands, so the access command for a widget is the same as the window name. When a widget is created within a namespace, however, its access command is installed in that namespace, and should be accessed outside of the namespace using a qualified name. For example, </p>

<pre>namespace foo {
    namespace bar {
        button .b -text "Testing"
    }
}
foo::bar::.b configure -background red
pack .b</pre> <p> Note that the window name "<tt>.b</tt>" is still used in conjunction with commands like <b><a href="../tkcmd/pack.htm.html">pack</a></b> and <b><a href="../tkcmd/destroy.htm.html">destroy</a></b>. However, the access command for the widget (i.e., name that appears as the <i>first</i> argument on a command line) must be more specific. </p>
<p> The "<b><a href="../tkcmd/winfo.htm.html">winfo command</a></b>" command can be used to query the fully-qualified access command for any widget, so one can write: </p>

<pre>[winfo command .b] configure -background red</pre> <p> and this is good practice when writing library procedures. Also, in conjunction with the <b><a href="../tkcmd/bind.htm.html">bind</a></b> command, the "%q" field can be used in place of "%W" as the access command: </p>

<pre>bind Button &lt;Key-Return&gt; {%q flash; %q invoke}</pre> <p> While this behavior makes sense from the standpoint of encapsulation, it causes problems with existing Tcl/Tk applications. Many existing applications are written with bindings that use "%W". Many library procedures assume that the window name is the access command. </p>
<p>The <b>itcl::purist</b> variable controls a backward-compatibility mode. By default, this variable is "0", and the window name can be used as an access command in any context. Whenever the <b><a href="../tclcmd/unknown.htm.html">unknown</a></b> procedure stumbles across a widget name, it simply uses "<b><a href="../tkcmd/winfo.htm.html">winfo command</a></b>" to determine the appropriate command name. If this variable is set to "1", this backward-compatibility mode is disabled. This gives better encapsulation, but using the window name as the access command may lead to "invalid command" errors. </p>

</dd>
<dt id="M7"><b>itcl::version</b></dt>
<dd> When an interpreter is created, <b>[incr Tcl]</b> initializes this variable to hold the version number of the form <i>x.y</i>. Changes to <i>x</i> represent major changes with probable incompatibilities and changes to <i>y</i> represent small enhancements and bug fixes that retain backward compatibility.
