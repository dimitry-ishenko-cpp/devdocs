extends CurrentOperations</pre> <p>The PortableServer::Current interface, derived from CORBA::Current, provides method implementations with access to the identity of the object on which the method was invoked. The Current interface is provided to support servants that implement multiple objects, but can be used within the context of POA-dispatched method invocations on any servant. To provide location transparency, ORBs are required to support use of Current in the context of both locally and remotely invoked operations. An instance of Current can be obtained by the application by issuing the CORBA::ORB::resolve_initial_references("POACurrent") operation. Thereafter, it can be used within the context of a method dispatched by the POA to obtain the POA and ObjectId that identify the object on which that operation was invoked.</p>       <h2 id="method.summary">Methods</h2> <table>  <tr> <th scope="col">Modifier and Type</th> <th scope="col">Method and Description</th> </tr> <tr id="i0"> <td><code>byte[]</code></td> <td>
