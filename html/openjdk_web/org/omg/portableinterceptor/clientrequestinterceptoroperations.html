<p>Client-side request interceptor. </p>
<p> A request Interceptor is designed to intercept the flow of a request/reply sequence through the ORB at specific points so that services can query the request information and manipulate the service contexts which are propagated between clients and servers. The primary use of request Interceptors is to enable ORB services to transfer context information between clients and servers. There are two types of request Interceptors: client-side and server-side. </p>
<p> To write a client-side Interceptor, implement the <code>ClientRequestInterceptor</code> interface.</p>

<p>Allows an Interceptor to query information during a Time-Independent Invocation (TII) polling get reply sequence. </p>
<p> With TII, an application may poll for a response to a request sent previously by the polling client or some other client. This poll is reported to Interceptors through the <code>send_poll</code> interception point and the response is returned through the <code>receive_reply</code> or <code>receive_exception</code> interception points. If the response is not available before the poll time-out expires, the system exception <code>TIMEOUT</code> is thrown and <code>receive_exception</code> is called with this exception. </p>

<p> This interception point may throw a system exception. If it does, no other Interceptors' <code>receive_reply</code> operations are called. The remaining Interceptors in the Flow Stack shall have their <code>receive_exception</code> interception point called. </p>

                throws ForwardRequest</pre> <div>
<p>Indicates to the interceptor that an exception occurred. Allows an Interceptor to query the exception's information before it is thrown to the client. </p>
<p> This interception point may throw a system exception. This has the effect of changing the exception which successive Interceptors popped from the Flow Stack receive on their calls to <code>receive_exception</code>. The exception thrown to the client will be the last exception thrown by an Interceptor, or the original exception if no Interceptor changes the exception. </p>
<p> This interception point may also throw a <code>ForwardRequest</code> exception. If an Interceptor throws this exception, no other Interceptors' <code>receive_exception</code> operations are called. The remaining Interceptors in the Flow Stack are popped and have their <code>receive_other</code> interception point called. </p>
<p> If the <code>completion_status</code> of the exception is not <code>COMPLETED_NO</code>, then it is inappropriate for this interception point to throw a <code>ForwardRequest</code> exception. The request s at-most-once semantics would be lost. </p>
<p> Compliant Interceptors shall properly follow <code>completion_status</code> semantics if they throw a system exception from this interception point. If the original exception is a system exception, the <code>completion_status</code> of the new exception shall be the same as on the original. If the original exception is a user exception, then the <code>completion_status</code> of the new exception shall be <code>COMPLETED_YES</code>. </p>
<p> Under some conditions, depending on what policies are in effect, an exception (such as <code>COMM_FAILURE</code>) may result in a retry of the request. While this retry is a new request with respect to Interceptors, there is one point of correlation between the original request and the retry: because control has not returned to the client, the <code>PortableInterceptor.Current</code> for both the original request and the retrying request is the same.</p>

<code>ri</code> - Information about the current request being intercepted.</dd> <dt>Throws:</dt> <dd>
<code><a href="forwardrequest.html">ForwardRequest</a></code> - If thrown, indicates to the ORB that a retry of the request should occur with the new object given in the exception.</dd> </dl>    <h3 id="receive_other-org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ClientRequestInfo-">receive_other</h3> <pre data-language="java">void receive_other(ClientRequestInfo ri)
            throws ForwardRequest</pre> <div>
<p>Allows an Interceptor to query the information available when a request results in something other than a normal reply or an exception. For example, a request could result in a retry (e.g., a GIOP Reply with a <code>LOCATION_FORWARD</code> status was received); or on asynchronous calls, the reply does not immediately follow the request, but control shall return to the client and an ending interception point shall be called. </p>
<p> For retries, depending on the policies in effect, a new request may or may not follow when a retry has been indicated. If a new request does follow, while this request is a new request, with respect to Interceptors, there is one point of correlation between the original request and the retry: because control has not returned to the client, the request scoped <code>PortableInterceptor.Current</code> for both the original request and the retrying request is the same. </p>
<p> This interception point may throw a system exception. If it does, no other Interceptors' <code>receive_other</code> operations are called. The remaining Interceptors in the Flow Stack are popped and have their <code>receive_exception</code> interception point called. </p>
<p> This interception point may also throw a <code>ForwardRequest</code> exception. If an Interceptor throws this exception, successive Interceptors' <code>receive_other</code> operations are called with the new information provided by the <code>ForwardRequest</code> exception. </p>
<p> Compliant Interceptors shall properly follow <code>completion_status</code> semantics if they throw a system exception from this interception point. The <code>completion_status</code> shall be <code>COMPLETED_NO</code>. If the target invocation had completed, this interception point would not be called.</p>
