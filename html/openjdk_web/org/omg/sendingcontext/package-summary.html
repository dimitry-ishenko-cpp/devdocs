<p>Provides support for the marshalling of value types. Value type marshalling may require access to an implementation of the value type or to meta information about the value type. This information is passed between the sending context and the receiving context using a particular service context containing an instance of the <code>SendingContext.RunTime</code> interface. </p>
<p> A sending context may be either the client side or the server side of an invocation, depending on which contains a value type. The sending context is the client side of an invocation if the request contains a value type. It is the server side if the reply contains a value type. The other party in the communication is the receiving context. </p>
<p> The service context marshalled for <code>SendingContext</code> consists of an encapsulated IOR for the <code>SendingContext.RunTime</code> interface. <code>RunTime</code> is just a marker interface defined to allow extensibility in the future. There is currently only one subinterface of <code>RunTime</code> defined: the <code>SendingContext.CodeBase</code> interface. The interface <code>CodeBase</code> defines operations to obtain code URLs and meta-information about a value type received from the sending context. </p>
<p> Note that these classes are currently defined in the <code>com.sun.org.omg.SendingContext</code> package rather than in the package <code>org.omg.SendingContext</code>. This has been done to avoid including large parts of the interface repository in the JDK core, since the interface repository is still evolving in response to the needs of the CORBA Components work. </p>
