<h1>Interface RunTimeOperations</h1>     <dl> <dt>All Known Subinterfaces:</dt> <dd><a href="runtime.html">RunTime</a></dd> </dl>  <br> <pre data-language="java">public interface RunTimeOperations</pre> <p>Defines operations on the base class that represents the Sending Context of a request. The sending context provides access to information about the runtime environment of the originator of a GIOP message. For example, when a value type is marshalled on a GIOP Request message, the receiver of the value type may need to ask the sender about the CodeBase for the implementation of the value type.</p><div class="_attribution">
