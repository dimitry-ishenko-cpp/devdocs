  <h2 id="package.description">Package java.rmi.registry Description</h2> <p>Provides a class and two interfaces for the RMI registry. A registry is a remote object that maps names to remote objects. A server registers its remote objects with the registry so that they can be looked up. When an object wants to invoke a method on a remote object, it must first lookup the remote object using its name. The registry returns to the calling object a reference to the remote object, using which a remote method can be invoked. </p> <dl> <dt>Since:</dt> <dd>JDK1.1</dd> </dl><div class="_attribution">
