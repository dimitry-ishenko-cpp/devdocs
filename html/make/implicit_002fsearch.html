  <h1 class="subsection">Directory Search and Implicit Rules</h1>        <p>The search through the directories specified in <code>VPATH</code> or with <code>vpath</code> also happens during consideration of implicit rules (see <a href="implicit-rules.html">Using Implicit Rules</a>). </p> <p>For example, when a file <samp>foo.o</samp> has no explicit rule, <code>make</code> considers implicit rules, such as the built-in rule to compile <samp>foo.c</samp> if that file exists. If such a file is lacking in the current directory, the appropriate directories are searched for it. If <samp>foo.c</samp> exists (or is mentioned in the makefile) in any of the directories, the implicit rule for C compilation is applied. </p> <p>The recipes of implicit rules normally use automatic variables as a matter of necessity; consequently they will use the file names found by directory search with no extra effort. </p><div class="_attribution">
