  <h1 class="subsection">Splitting Long Lines</h1>    <p>Makefiles use a “line-based” syntax in which the newline character is special and marks the end of a statement. GNU <code>make</code> has no limit on the length of a statement line, up to the amount of memory in your computer. </p> <p>However, it is difficult to read lines which are too long to display without wrapping or scrolling. So, you can format your makefiles for readability by adding newlines into the middle of a statement: you do this by escaping the internal newlines with a backslash (<code>\</code>) character. Where we need to make a distinction we will refer to “physical lines” as a single line ending with a newline (regardless of whether it is escaped) and a “logical line” being a complete statement including all escaped newlines up to the first non-escaped newline. </p> <p>The way in which backslash/newline combinations are handled depends on whether the statement is a recipe line or a non-recipe line. Handling of backslash/newline in a recipe line is discussed later (see <a href="splitting-recipe-lines.html">Splitting Recipe Lines</a>). </p> <p>Outside of recipe lines, backslash/newlines are converted into a single space character. Once that is done, all whitespace around the backslash/newline is condensed into a single space: this includes all whitespace preceding the backslash, all whitespace at the beginning of the line after the backslash/newline, and any consecutive backslash/newline combinations. </p> <p>If the <code>.POSIX</code> special target is defined then backslash/newline handling is modified slightly to conform to POSIX.2: first, whitespace preceding a backslash is not removed and second, consecutive backslash/newlines are not condensed. </p> <h4 class="subsubheading">Splitting Without Adding Whitespace</h4>   <p>If you need to split a line but do <em>not</em> want any whitespace added, you can utilize a subtle trick: replace your backslash/newline pairs with the three characters dollar sign, backslash, and newline: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">var := one$\
       word
</pre>
</div> <p>After <code>make</code> removes the backslash/newline and condenses the following line into a single space, this is equivalent to: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">var := one$ word
</pre>
</div> <p>Then <code>make</code> will perform variable expansion. The variable reference ‘<samp>$ </samp>’ refers to a variable with the one-character name “ ” (space) which does not exist, and so expands to the empty string, giving a final assignment which is the equivalent of: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">var := oneword
</pre>
