  <h1 class="section">Recursive Use of make</h1>   <p>Recursive use of <code>make</code> means using <code>make</code> as a command in a makefile. This technique is useful when you want separate makefiles for various subsystems that compose a larger system. For example, suppose you have a sub-directory <samp>subdir</samp> which has its own makefile, and you would like the containing directory’s makefile to run <code>make</code> on the sub-directory. You can do it by writing this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">subsystem:
        cd subdir &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)
</pre>
</div> <p>or, equivalently, this (see <a href="options-summary.html">Summary of Options</a>): </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">subsystem:
        $(MAKE) -C subdir
</pre>
</div>   <p>You can write recursive <code>make</code> commands just by copying this example, but there are many things to know about how they work and why, and about how the sub-<code>make</code> relates to the top-level <code>make</code>. You may also find it useful to declare targets that invoke recursive <code>make</code> commands as ‘<samp>.PHONY</samp>’ (for more discussion on when this is useful, see <a href="phony-targets.html">Phony Targets</a>). </p>  <p>For your convenience, when GNU <code>make</code> starts (after it has processed any <code>-C</code> options) it sets the variable <code>CURDIR</code> to the pathname of the current working directory. This value is never touched by <code>make</code> again: in particular note that if you include files from other directories the value of <code>CURDIR</code> does not change. The value has the same precedence it would have if it were set in the makefile (by default, an environment variable <code>CURDIR</code> will not override this value). Note that setting this variable has no impact on the operation of <code>make</code> (it does not cause <code>make</code> to change its working directory, for example). </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
