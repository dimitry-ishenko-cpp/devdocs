  <h1 class="section">Temporary Files</h1>  <p>In some situations, <code>make</code> will need to create its own temporary files. These files must not be disturbed while <code>make</code> is running, including all recursively-invoked instances of <code>make</code>. </p>  <p>If the environment variable <code>MAKE_TMPDIR</code> is set then all temporary files created by <code>make</code> will be placed there. </p>    <p>If <code>MAKE_TMPDIR</code> is not set, then the standard location for temporary files for the current operating system will be used. For POSIX systems this will be the location set in the <code>TMPDIR</code> environment variable, or else the system’s default location (e.g., <samp>/tmp</samp>) is used. On Windows, first <code>TMP</code> then <code>TEMP</code> will be checked, then <code>TMPDIR</code>, and finally the system default temporary file location will be used. </p> <p>Note that this directory must already exist or <code>make</code> will fail: <code>make</code> will not attempt to create it. </p> <p>These variables <em>cannot</em> be set from within a makefile: GNU <code>make</code> must have access to this location before it begins reading the makefiles. </p><div class="_attribution">
