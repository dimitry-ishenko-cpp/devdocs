  <h1 class="subsection">How Loaded Objects Are Remade</h1>    <p>Loaded objects undergo the same re-make procedure as makefiles (see <a href="remaking-makefiles.html">How Makefiles Are Remade</a>). If any loaded object is recreated, then <code>make</code> will start from scratch and re-read all the makefiles, and reload the object files again. It is not necessary for the loaded object to do anything special to support this. </p> <p>It’s up to the makefile author to provide the rules needed for rebuilding the loaded object. </p><div class="_attribution">
