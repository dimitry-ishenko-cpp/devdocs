  <h1 class="section">Arguments to Specify the Makefile</h1>    <p>The way to specify the name of the makefile is with the ‘<samp>-f</samp>’ or ‘<samp>--file</samp>’ option (‘<samp>--makefile</samp>’ also works). For example, ‘<samp>-f altmake</samp>’ says to use the file <samp>altmake</samp> as the makefile. </p> <p>If you use the ‘<samp>-f</samp>’ flag several times and follow each ‘<samp>-f</samp>’ with an argument, all the specified files are used jointly as makefiles. </p> <p>If you do not use the ‘<samp>-f</samp>’ or ‘<samp>--file</samp>’ flag, the default is to try <samp>GNUmakefile</samp>, <samp>makefile</samp>, and <samp>Makefile</samp>, in that order, and use the first of these three which exists or can be made (see <a href="makefiles.html">Writing Makefiles</a>). </p><div class="_attribution">
