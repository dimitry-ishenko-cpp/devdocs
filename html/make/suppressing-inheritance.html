  <h1 class="section">Suppressing Inheritance</h1>    <p>As described in previous sections, <code>make</code> variables are inherited by prerequisites. This capability allows you to modify the behavior of a prerequisite based on which targets caused it to be rebuilt. For example, you might set a target-specific variable on a <code>debug</code> target, then running ‘<samp>make debug</samp>’ will cause that variable to be inherited by all prerequisites of <code>debug</code>, while just running ‘<samp>make all</samp>’ (for example) would not have that assignment. </p> <p>Sometimes, however, you may not want a variable to be inherited. For these situations, <code>make</code> provides the <code>private</code> modifier. Although this modifier can be used with any variable assignment, it makes the most sense with target- and pattern-specific variables. Any variable marked <code>private</code> will be visible to its local target but will not be inherited by prerequisites of that target. A global variable marked <code>private</code> will be visible in the global scope but will not be inherited by any target, and hence will not be visible in any recipe. </p> <p>As an example, consider this makefile: </p>
<div class="example"> <pre class="example">EXTRA_CFLAGS =

prog: private EXTRA_CFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib
prog: a.o b.o
</pre>
</div> <p>Due to the <code>private</code> modifier, <code>a.o</code> and <code>b.o</code> will not inherit the <code>EXTRA_CFLAGS</code> variable assignment from the <code>prog</code> target. </p><div class="_attribution">
