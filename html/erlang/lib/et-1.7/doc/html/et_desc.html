One <code>Collector</code> may be used as backing storage for several simultaneous <code>Viewers</code> where each one may display a different view of the same trace data.</p> <p>The interface between the <code>Collector</code> and its <code>Viewers</code> is public in order to enable other types of <code>Viewers</code>. However in the following text we will focus on usage of the <code>et_viewer</code>.</p> <p>The main start function is <code>et_viewer:start/1</code>.

The order of the actors may be altered by dragging (hold mouse button 1 pressed during the operation) the name tag of an actor and drop it elsewhere:</p> <div class="doc-image-wrapper">  <p class="doc-image-caption">Figure 3.2: Two actors has switched places</p> </div> <p>An <code>Event</code> may be an action performed by one single actor (blue text label) or it may involve two actors and is then depicted as an arrow directed from one actor to another (red text label). Details of an <code>Event</code> can be shown by clicking (press and release the mouse button 1) on the event label text or on the arrow. When doing that a <code>Contents Viewer</code> window pops up. It may look like this:</p>  <div class="doc-image-wrapper">  <p class="doc-image-caption">Figure 3.3: Details of a write lock message</p> </div> <h2 id="filters-and-dictionary" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">3.2 Filters and dictionary</div>  </h2> <p>The <code>Event Tracer (ET)</code> uses named filters in various contexts. An Event Trace filter is an <code>Erlang fun</code> that takes some trace data as input and returns a possibly modified version of it: </p>  <pre data-language="erlang">filter(TraceData) -&gt; false | true | {true, NewEvent}

TraceData = Event | erlang_trace_data()
Event = #event{}
NewEvent = #event{}</pre> <p>The interface of the filter function is the same as the the filter functions for the good old <code>lists:filtermap/2</code>. If the filter returns <code>false</code> it means that the trace data should silently be dropped. <code>true</code> means that the trace data data already is an <code>Event Record</code> and that it should be kept as it is. <code>true</code> means that the <code>TraceData</code> already is an <code>Event Record</code> and that it should be kept as it is. <code>{true, NewEvent}</code> means that the original trace data should be replaced with <code>Event</code>. This provides means to get rid of unwanted <code>Events</code> as well as enabling alternate views of an <code>Event</code>.</p> <p>The first filter that the trace data is exposed for is the <code>Collector Filter</code>. When a trace <code>Event</code> is reported with <code>et_collector:report/2</code> (or <code>et_collector:report_event/5,6</code>) the first thing that happens, is that a message is sent to the <code>Collector</code> process to fetch a handle that contains some useful stuff, such as the <code>Collector Filter Fun</code> and an Ets table identifier. Then the <code>Collector Filter Fun</code> is applied and if it returns <code>true</code> (or <code>{true, NewEvent}</code>), the <code>Event</code> will be stored in an Ets table. As an optimization, subsequent calls to <code>et_collector:report</code>-functions can use the handle directly instead of the <code>Collector Pid</code>.</p> <p>All filters (registered in a <code>Collector</code> or in a <code>Viewer</code>) must be able to handle an <code>Event record</code> as input. The <code>Collector Filter</code> (that is the filter named <code>all</code>) is a little bit special, as its input also may be raw <code>Erlang Trace Data</code></p> <p>The <code>Collector</code> manages a key/value based dictionary, where the filters are stored. Updates of the dictionary is propagated to all subscribing processes. When a <code>Viewer</code> is started it is registered as a subscriber of dictionary updates.</p> <p>In each <code>Viewer</code> there is only one filter that is active and all trace <code>Events</code> that the <code>Viewer</code> gets from the <code>Collector</code> will pass thru that filter. By writing clever filters it is possible to customize how the <code>Events</code> looks like in the viewer. The following filter in <code>et/examples/et_demo.erl</code> replaces the actor names <code>mnesia_tm</code> and <code>mnesia_locker</code> and leaves everything else in the record as it was:</p>  <pre data-language="erlang">mgr_actors(E) when is_record(E, event) -&gt;
    Actor = fun(A) -&gt;
               case A of
                   mnesia_tm     -&gt; trans_mgr;
                   mnesia_locker -&gt; lock_mgr;
                   _             -&gt; A
               end
            end,
    {true, E#event{from = Actor(E#event.from),
                   to = Actor(E#event.to),
                   contents = [{orig_from, E#event.from},
                               {orig_to,   E#event.to},
                               {orig_contents, E#event.contents}]}}.</pre> <p>If we now add the filter to the running <code>Collector</code>:</p>  <pre data-language="erlang">4&gt; Fun = fun(E) -&gt; et_demo:mgr_actors(E) end.
#Fun&lt;erl_eval.6.13229925&gt;
5&gt; et_collector:dict_insert(Collector, {filter, mgr_actors}, Fun).
ok</pre> <p>you will see that the <code>Filter</code> menu in all viewers have got a new entry called <code>mgr_actors</code>. Select it, and a new <code>Viewer</code> window will pop up:</p>  <div class="doc-image-wrapper">  <p class="doc-image-caption">Figure 3.4: The same trace data in a different view</p> </div> <p>In order to see the nitty gritty details of an <code>Event</code> you may click on the <code>Event</code> in order to start a <code>Contents Viewer</code> for that <code>Event</code>. In the <code>Contents Viewer</code> there also is a filter menu that enables inspection of the <code>Event</code> from other views than the one selected in the viewer. A click on the <code>new_tid</code> <code>Event</code> will cause a <code>Contents Viewer</code> window to pop up, showing the <code>Event</code> in the <code>mgr_actors</code> view:</p> <div class="doc-image-wrapper">  <p class="doc-image-caption">Figure 3.5: The trace Event in the mgr_actors view</p> </div> <p>Select the <code>all</code> entry in the <code>Filters</code> menu and a new <code>Contents Viewer window</code> will pop up showing the same trace <code>Event</code> in the collectors view:</p> <div class="doc-image-wrapper">  <p class="doc-image-caption">Figure 3.6: The same trace Event in the collectors view</p> </div> <h2 id="trace-clients" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">3.3 Trace clients</div>  </h2> <p>As you have seen, it is possible to use the <code>et_collector:report_event/5,6</code> functions explicitly. By using those functions you can write your own trace client that reads trace data from any source stored in any format and just feed the <code>Collector</code> with it. You may replace the default <code>Collector Filter</code> with a filter that converts new exciting trace data formats to <code>Event Records</code> or you may convert it to an <code>Event Record</code> before you invoke <code>et_collector:report/2</code> and then rely on the default <code>Collector Filter</code> to handle the new format.</p> <p>There are also existing functions in the API that reads from various sources and calls <code>et_collector:report/2</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The trace <code>Events</code> that are hosted by the <code>Collector</code> may be stored to file and later be loaded by selecting <code>save</code> and <code>load</code> entries in the <code>Viewers</code> <code>File</code> menu or via the <code>et_collector</code> API.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is also possible to perform live tracing of a running system by making use of the built-in trace support in the Erlang emulator. These Erlang traces can be directed to files or to ports. See the reference manual for <code>erlang:trace/4</code>, <code>erlang:trace_pattern/3</code>, <code>dbg</code> and <code>ttb</code> for more info.</p> <p>There are also corresponding trace client types that can read the Erlang trace data format from such files or ports. The <code>et_collector:start_trace_client/3</code> function makes use of these Erlang trace clients and redirects the trace data to the <code>Collector</code>.</p> <p>The default <code>Collector Filter</code> converts the raw Erlang trace data format into <code>Event Records</code>. If you want to perform this differently you can of course write your own <code>Collector Filter</code> from scratch. But it may probably save you some efforts if you first apply the default filter in <code>et_selector:parse_event/2</code> before you apply your own conversions of its output.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="global-tracing" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">3.4 Global tracing</div>  </h2> <p>Setting up an Erlang tracer on a set of nodes and connecting trace clients to the ports of these tracers is not intuitive. In order to make this it easier the <code>Event Tracer</code> has a notion of global tracing. When used, the <code>et_collector</code> process will monitor Erlang nodes and when one connects, an Erlang tracer will automatically be started on the newly connected node. A corresponding trace client will also be started on the <code>Collector</code> node in order to automatically forward the trace <code>Events</code> to the <code>Collector</code>. Set the boolean parameter <code>trace_global</code> to <code>true</code> for either the <code>et_collector</code> or <code>et_viewer</code> in order to activate the global tracing. There is no restriction on how many concurrent (anonymous) collectors you can have, but you can only have one <strong>global</strong> <code>Collector</code> as its name is registered in <code>global</code>.</p> <p>In order to further simplify the tracing, you can make use of the <code>et:trace_me/4,5</code> functions. These functions are intended to be invoked from other applications when there are interesting <code>Events</code>, in your application that needs to be highlighted. The functions are extremely light weight as they do nothing besides returning an atom. These functions are specifically designed to be traced for. As the caller explicitly provides the values for the <code>Event Record</code> fields, the default <code>Collector Filter</code> is able to automatically provide a customized <code>Event Record</code> without any user defined filter functions.</p> <p>In normal operation, the <code>et:trace_me/4,5</code> calls are almost for free. When tracing is needed, you can either activate tracing on these functions explicitly. Or you can combine the usage of <code>trace_global</code> with the usage of <code>trace_pattern</code>. When set, the <code>trace_pattern</code> will automatically be activated on all connected nodes. </p> <p>One nice thing with the <code>trace_pattern</code> is that it provides a very simple way of minimizing the amount of generated trace data by allowing you to explicitly control the detail level of the tracing. As you may have seen the <code>et_viewer</code> have a slider called <code>"Detail Level"</code> that allows you to control the detail level of the trace <code>Events</code> displayed in the <code>Viewer</code>. On the other hand if you set a low detail level in the <code>trace_pattern</code>, lots of the trace data will never be generated and thus not sent over the socket to the trace client and stored in the <code>Collector</code>.</p> <h2 id="viewer-window" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">3.5 Viewer window</div>  </h2> <p>Almost all functionality available in the <code>et_viewer</code> is also available via shortcuts. Which key that has the same effect as selecting a menu entry is shown enclosed in parentheses. For example pressing the key <code>r</code> is equivalent to selecting the menu entry <code>Viewer-&gt;Refresh</code>.</p> <p>File menu:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>Clear all events in the Collector</code> - Deletes all <code>Events</code> stored in the <code>Collector</code> and notifies all connected <code>Viewers</code> about this.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Load events to the Collector from file</code> - Loads the <code>Collector</code> with <code>Events</code> from a file and notifies all connected <code>Viewers</code> about this.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Save all events in the Collector to file</code> - Saves all <code>Events</code> stored in the <code>Collector</code> to file.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Print setup</code> - Enables editing of printer setting, such as paper and layout.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Print current page</code> - Prints the events on the current page.
