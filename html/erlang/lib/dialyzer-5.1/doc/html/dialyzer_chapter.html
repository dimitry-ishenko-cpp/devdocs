The PLT can then be used as a starting point for later analyses. It is recommended to build a PLT with the Erlang/OTP applications that you are using, but also to include your own applications that you are using frequently.</p> <p>The PLT is built using option <code>--build_plt</code> to Dialyzer. The following command builds the recommended minimal PLT for Erlang/OTP:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">dialyzer --build_plt --apps erts kernel stdlib mnesia</pre> <p>Dialyzer looks if there is an environment variable called <code>DIALYZER_PLT</code> and places the PLT at this location. If no such variable is set, Dialyzer places the PLT in a file called .dialyzer_plt in the <code> filename:basedir(user_cache, "erlang")</code> folder. The placement can also be specified using the options <code>--plt</code> or <code>--output_plt</code>.</p> <p>Information can be added to an existing PLT using option <code>--add_to_plt</code>. If you also want to include the Erlang compiler in the PLT and place it in a new PLT, then use the following command:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">dialyzer --add_to_plt --apps compiler --output_plt my.plt</pre> <p>Then you can add your favorite application my_app to the new PLT:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">dialyzer --add_to_plt --plt my.plt -r my_app/ebin</pre> <p>But you realize that it is unnecessary to have the Erlang compiler in this one:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">dialyzer --remove_from_plt --plt my.plt --apps compiler</pre> <p>Later, when you have fixed a bug in your application my_app, you want to update the PLT so that it becomes fresh the next time you run Dialyzer. In this case, run the following command:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">dialyzer --check_plt --plt my.plt</pre> <p>Dialyzer then reanalyzes the changed files and the files that depend on these files. Notice that this consistency check is performed automatically the next time you run Dialyzer with this PLT. Option <code>--check_plt</code> is only for doing so without doing any other analysis.</p> <p>To get information about a PLT, use the following option:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">dialyzer --plt_info</pre> <p>To specify which PLT, use option <code>--plt</code>.</p> <p>To get the output printed to a file, use option <code>--output_file</code>.</p> <p>Notice that when manipulating the PLT, no warnings are emitted. To turn on warnings during (re)analysis of the PLT, use option <code>--get_warnings</code>.</p> <h2 id="using-dialyzer-from-the-command-line" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">1.3 Using Dialyzer from the Command Line</div>  </h2> <p>Dialyzer has a command-line version for automated use. See <code><a href="dialyzer.html">dialyzer(3)</a></code>.</p> <h2 id="using-dialyzer-from-erlang" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">1.4 Using Dialyzer from Erlang</div>  </h2> <p>Dialyzer can also be used directly from Erlang.

Click your way to the directories/modules you want to add or type the correct path in the entry.</p> <p>Mark the directories/modules you want to analyze for discrepancies and click <strong>Add</strong>. You can either add the <code>.beam</code> and <code>.erl</code> files directly, or add directories that contain these kind of files. Notice that you are only allowed to add the type of files that can be analyzed in the current mode of operation (see below), and that you cannot mix <code>.beam</code> and <code>.erl</code> files.</p> <h3 id="analysis-modes" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Analysis Modes</div>  </h3> <p>Dialyzer has two analysis modes: "Byte Code" and "Source Code". They are controlled by the buttons in the top-middle part of the main window, under <strong>Analysis Options</strong>.</p> <h3 id="controlling-the-discrepancies-reported-by-dialyzer" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Controlling the Discrepancies Reported by Dialyzer</div>  </h3> <p>Under the <strong>Warnings</strong> pull-down menu, there are buttons that control which discrepancies are reported to the user in the <strong>Warnings</strong> window. By clicking these buttons, you can enable/disable a whole class of warnings. Information about the classes of warnings is found on the "Warnings" item under the <strong>Help</strong> menu (in the rightmost top corner).</p> <p>If modules are compiled with inlining, spurious warnings can be emitted. In the <strong>Options</strong> menu you can choose to ignore inline-compiled modules when analyzing byte code. When starting from source code, this is not a problem because inlining is explicitly turned off by Dialyzer. The option causes Dialyzer to suppress all warnings from inline-compiled modules, as there is currently no way for Dialyzer to find what parts of the code have been produced by inlining.</p> <h3 id="running-the-analysis" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Running the Analysis</div>  </h3> <p>Once you have chosen the modules or directories you want to analyze, click the <strong>Run</strong> button to start the analysis. If you for some reason want to stop the analysis while it is running, click the <strong>Stop</strong> button.</p> <p>The information from the analysis is displayed in the <strong>Log</strong> window and the <strong>Warnings</strong> window.</p> <h3 id="include-directories-and-macro-definitions" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Include Directories and Macro Definitions</div>  </h3> <p>When analyzing from source, you might have to supply Dialyzer with a list of include directories and macro definitions (as you can do with the <code>erlc</code> flags <code>-I</code> and <code>-D</code>). This can be done either by starting Dialyzer with these flags from the command line as in:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">dialyzer -I my_includes -DDEBUG -Dvsn=42 -I one_more_dir</pre> <p>or by adding these explicitly using submenu <strong>Manage Macro Definitions</strong> or <strong>Manage Include Directories</strong> in the <strong>Options</strong> menu.</p> <h3 id="saving-the-information-on-the-log-and-warnings-windows" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Saving the Information on the Log and Warnings Windows</div>  </h3> <p>The <strong>File</strong> menu includes options to save the contents of the <strong>Log</strong> window and the <strong>Warnings</strong> window.

In the <strong>PLT</strong> menu you can choose to either search the PLT or inspect the contents of the whole PLT. The information is presented in <code>EDoc</code> format.</p> <h2 id="dialyzer's-model-of-analysis" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">1.6 Dialyzer's Model of Analysis</div>  </h2> <p>Dialyzer operates somewhere between a classical type checker and a more general static-analysis tool: It checks and consumes function specs, yet doesn't require them, and it can find bugs across modules which consider the dataflow of the programs under analysis. This means Dialyzer can find genuine bugs in complex code, and is pragmatic in the face of missing specs or limited information about the codebase, only reporting issues which it can prove have the potential to cause a genuine issue at runtime. This means Dialyzer will sometimes not report every bug, since it cannot always find this proof. </p> <h3 id="how-dialyzer-utilises-function-specifications" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">How Dialyzer Utilises Function Specifications</div>  </h3> <p>Dialyzer infers types for all top-level functions in a module. If the module also has a spec given in the source-code, Dialyzer will compare the inferred type to the spec. The comparison checks, for each argument and the return, that the inferred and specified types overlap - which is to say, the types have at least one possible runtime value in common. Notice that Dialyzer does not check that one type contains a subset of values of the other, or that they're precisely equal: This allows Dialyzer to make simplifying assumptions to preserve performance and avoid reporting program flows which could potentially succeed at runtime. </p> <p>If the inferred and specified types do not overlap, Dialyzer will warn that the spec is invalid with respect to the implementation. If they do overlap, however, Dialyzer will proceed under the assumption that the correct type for the given function is the intersection of the inferred type and the specified type (the rationale being that the user may know something that Dialyzer itself cannot deduce). One implication of this is that if the user gives a spec for a function which overlaps with Dialyzer's inferred type, but is more restrictive, Dialyzer will trust those restrictions. This may then generate an error elsewhere which follows from the erroneously restricted spec. </p> <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p> <p>Non-overlapping argument:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">-spec foo(boolean()) -&gt; string().
%% Dialyzer will infer: foo(integer()) -&gt; string().
foo(N) -&gt;
    integer_to_list(N).</pre> <p>Since the type of the argument in the spec is different from the type that Dialyzer inferred, Dialyzer will generate the following warning:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
some_module.erl:7:2: Invalid type specification for function some_module:foo/1.
 The success typing is t:foo
          (integer()) -&gt; string()
 But the spec is t:foo
          (boolean()) -&gt; string()
 They do not overlap in the 1st argument</pre> <p>Non-overlapping return:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">-spec bar(a | b) -&gt; atom().
%% Dialyzer will infer: bar(a | b) -&gt; binary().
bar(a) -&gt; &lt;&lt;"a"&gt;&gt;;
bar(b) -&gt; &lt;&lt;"b"&gt;&gt;.</pre> <p>Since the return value in the spec and the return value inferred by Dialyzer are different, Dialyzer will generate the following warning:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
some_module.erl:11:2: Invalid type specification for function some_module:bar/1.
 The success typing is t:bar
          ('a' | 'b') -&gt; &lt;&lt;_:8&gt;&gt;
 But the spec is t:bar
          ('a' | 'b') -&gt; atom()
 The return types do not overlap</pre> <p>Overlapping spec and inferred type:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">-spec baz(a | b) -&gt; non_neg_integer().
%% Dialyzer will infer: baz(b | c | d) -&gt; -1 | 0 | 1.
baz(b) -&gt; -1;
baz(c) -&gt; 0;
baz(d) -&gt; 1.</pre> <p>Dialyzer will "trust" the spec and using the intersection of the spec and inferred type:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
baz(b) -&gt; 0 | 1.</pre> <p>Notice how the <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> from the argument to <code>baz/1</code> and the <code>-1</code> in the return from the inferred type were dropped once the spec and inferred type were intersected. This could result in warnings being emitted for later functions.</p> <p>For example, if <code>baz/1</code> is called like this:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">call_baz1(A) -&gt;
    case baz(A) of
        -1 -&gt; negative;
        0 -&gt; zero;
        1 -&gt; positive
    end.</pre> <p>Dialyzer will generate the following warning:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
some_module.erl:25:9: The pattern
          -1 can never match the type
          0 | 1</pre> <p>If <code>baz/1</code> is called like this:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">call_baz2() -&gt;
    baz(a).</pre> <p>Dialyzer will generate the following warnings:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
some_module.erl:30:1: Function call_baz2/0 has no local return
some_module.erl:31:9: The call t:baz
         ('a') will never return since it differs in the 1st argument
               from the success typing arguments:
         ('b' | 'c' | 'd')</pre> <h2 id="feedback-and-bug-reports" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">1.7 Feedback and Bug Reports</div>  </h2> <p>We very much welcome user feedback - even wishlists!
