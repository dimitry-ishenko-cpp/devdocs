<div class="innertube"> <h1 id="Audit Trail Log">14 Audit Trail Log</h1> <p>The chapter <strong>Audit Trail Log</strong> describes the audit trail logging. </p> <p>Both the agent and the manager can be configured to log incoming and outgoing messages. It uses the Erlang standard log mechanism <code>disk_log</code> for logging. The size and location of the log files are configurable. A wrap log is used, which means that when the log has grown to a maximum size, it starts from the beginning of the log, overwriting existing log records. </p> <p>The log can be either a <code>read</code>, <code>write</code> or a <code>read_write</code>. </p> <h2 id="agent-logging" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">14.1 Agent Logging</div>  </h2> <p>For the agent, a <code>write</code>, means that all <code>set</code> requests and their responses are stored. No <code>get</code> requests or traps are stored in a <code>write</code>. A <code>read_write</code>, all requests, responses and traps are stored. </p> <p>The log uses a raw data format (basically the BER encoded message), in order to minimize the CPU load needed for the log mechanism. This means that the log is not human readable, but needs to be formatted off-line before it can be read. Use the function <code><a href="snmpa.html#log_to_txt">snmpa:log_to_txt</a></code> for this purpose. </p> <h2 id="manager-logging" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">14.2 Manager Logging</div>  </h2> <p>For the manager, a <code>write</code>, means that all requests (<code>set</code> and <code>get</code>) and their responses are stored.
