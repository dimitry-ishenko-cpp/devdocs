<div class="innertube"> <h1 id="Ports and Port Drivers">17 Ports and Port Drivers</h1> <p>Examples of how to use ports and port drivers are provided in <code> Interoperability Tutorial</code>. For information about the BIFs mentioned, see the <code>erlang(3)</code> manual page in ERTS.</p> <h2 id="ports" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">17.1 Ports</div>  </h2> <p><strong>Ports</strong> provide the basic mechanism for communication with the external world, from Erlang's point of view. They provide a byte-oriented interface to an external program. When a port has been created, Erlang can communicate with it by sending and receiving lists of bytes, including binaries.</p> <p>The Erlang process creating a port is said to be the <strong>port owner</strong>, or the <strong>connected process</strong> of the port. All communication to and from the port must go through the port owner. If the port owner terminates, so does the port (and the external program, if it is written correctly).</p> <p>The external program resides in another OS process. By default, it reads from standard input (file descriptor 0) and writes to standard output (file descriptor 1). The external program is to terminate when the port is closed.</p> <h2 id="port-drivers" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">17.2 Port Drivers</div>  </h2> <p>It is possible to write a driver in C according to certain principles and dynamically link it to the Erlang runtime system. The linked-in driver looks like a port from the Erlang programmer's point of view and is called a <strong>port driver</strong>.</p> <div class="warning"> <div class="label">Warning</div> <div class="content">

<p>An erroneous port driver causes the entire Erlang runtime system to leak memory, hang or crash.</p> </div> </div> <p>For information about port drivers, see the <code>erl_driver(4)</code> manual page in ERTS, <code>driver_entry(1)</code> manual page in ERTS, and <code>erl_ddll(3)</code> manual page in Kernel.</p> <h2 id="port-bifs" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">17.3 Port BIFs</div>  </h2> <p>To create a port:</p> <div class="doc-table-wrapper"> <table class="doc-table"><tr> <td><code>open_port(PortName, PortSettings</code></td> <td>Returns a port identifier <code>Port</code> as the result of opening a new Erlang port. Messages can be sent to, and received from, a port identifier, just like a pid. Port identifiers can also be linked to using <code>link/1</code>, or registered under a name using <code>register/2</code>.</td> </tr></table> <p class="doc-table-caption">Table 17.1: Port Creation BIF</p> </div> <p><code>PortName</code> is usually a tuple <code>{spawn,Command}</code>, where the string <code>Command</code> is the name of the external program. The external program runs outside the Erlang workspace, unless a port driver with the name <code>Command</code> is found. If <code>Command</code> is found, that driver is started.</p> <p><code>PortSettings</code> is a list of settings (options) for the port. The list typically contains at least a tuple <code>{packet,N}</code>, which specifies that data sent between the port and the external program are preceded by an N-byte length indicator. Valid values for N are 1, 2, or 4. If binaries are to be used instead of lists of bytes, the option <code>binary</code> must be included.</p> <p>The port owner <code>Pid</code> can communicate with the port <code>Port</code> by sending and receiving messages. (In fact, any process can send the messages to the port, but the port owner must be identified in the message).</p> <p>Messages sent to ports are delivered asynchronously.</p> <div class="change"> <div class="label">Change</div> <div class="content">

<p>Before Erlang/OTP 16, messages to ports were delivered synchronously.</p>

Unless the port is already closed, the port replies with<code>{Port,connected}</code> to the old port owner.
