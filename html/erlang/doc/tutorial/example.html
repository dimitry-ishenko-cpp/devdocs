<div class="innertube"> <h1 id="Problem Example">3 Problem Example</h1> <h2 id="description" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">3.1 Description</div>  </h2> <p>A common interoperability situation is when you want to incorporate a piece of code, solving a complex problem, in your Erlang program. Suppose for example, that you have the following C functions that you would like to call from Erlang:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">/* complex.c */

int foo(int x) {
  return x+1;
}

int bar(int y) {
  return y*2;
}</pre> <p>The functions are deliberately kept as simple as possible, for readability reasons.</p> <p>From an Erlang perspective, it is preferable to be able to call <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> without having to bother about that they are C functions:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
% Erlang code
...
Res = complex:foo(X),
...</pre> <p>Here, the communication with C is hidden in the implementation of <code>complex.erl</code>. In the following sections, it is shown how this module can be implemented using the different interoperability mechanisms.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
