See <code>Upcoming Potential Incompatibilities</code> for more details.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18498</p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed a crash during tracing on certain platforms that cannot use the machine stack for Erlang code (mainly OpenBSD and Linux with musl).</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18561</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="improvements-and-new-features" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Improvements and New Features</div>  </h3> <ul> <li> <p> The <code>enif_set_option()</code> function has been introduced into the NIF API. It can be used in order to set the <code>ERL_NIF_OPT_DELAY_HALT</code> and/or <code>ERL_NIF_OPT_ON_HALT</code> options with which one can synchronize halt of the runtime system with flushing enabled and execution of NIFs. <code>Halt of the runtime system <i>without</i> flushing enabled</code>, now terminates the runtime system without execution of <code>atexit</code>/<code>on_exit</code> handlers that may have been installed into the runtime system which might be considered a potential incompatibility.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-17771 Aux Id: GH-5325, PR-6370 </p> </li> <li> <p>The TTY/terminal subsystem has been rewritten by moving more code to Erlang from the old linked-in driver and implementing all the I/O primitives needed in a NIF instead. </p> <p> On Unix platforms the user should not notice a lot of difference, besides better handling of unicode characters and fixing of some long standing bugs. </p> <p> Windows users will notice that erl.exe has the same functionality as a normal Unix shell and that werl.exe has been removed and replaced with a symlink to erl.exe. This makes the Windows Erlang terminal experience identical to that of Unix. </p> <p> The re-write brings with it a number of bug fixes and feature additions:</p> <ul> <li>The TTY is now reset when Erlang exits, fixing zsh to not break when terminating an Erlang session.</li> <li> <code>standard_error</code> now uses the same unicode mode as <code>standard_io</code>.</li> <li>Hitting backspace when searching the shell history with an empty search string no longer breaks the shell.</li> <li>Tab expansion now works on remote nodes started using the JCL interface.</li> <li>It is now possible to configure the shell slogan and the session slogans (that is the texts that appear when you start an Erlang shell). See the kernel documentation for more details.</li> <li>Added shell:start_interactive for starting the interactive shell from a non-interactive Erlang session (for example an escript).</li> <li>On Windows, when starting in detached mode the standard handler are now set to <code>nul</code> devices instead of being unset.</li> <li> Standard I/O now always defaults to <code>unicode</code> mode if supported. Previously the default was <code>latin1</code> if the runtime system had been started with <code>-oldshell</code> or <code>-noshell</code> (for example in an <code>escript</code>). To send raw bytes over standard out, one now explicitly has to specify <code>io:setopts(standard_io, [{encoding, latin1}]).</code> </li> </ul> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-17932 Aux Id: PR-6144 GH-3150 GH-3390 GH-4343 GH-4225 </p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for socket on Windows.</p> <ul> <li>Pre release status.</li> <li>Error codes not finalized.</li> <li>No explicit support for Windows specific options (socket options, flags for read and write).</li> <li>New async api for Windows (completion). See the <code>Asynchronous calls</code> chapter in the (Socket Usage) Users Guide.</li> <li>To ensure platform independence, gen_tcp and gen_udp is <strong>intended</strong> to be used (not yet updated).</li> </ul> <p> Own Id: OTP-18029</p> </li> <li> <p> Updated configure cache for Windows. This makes configure run faster on Windows as many more checks are cached.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18053 Aux Id: PR-6101 </p> </li> <li> <p>Optimized record updates.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18126 Aux Id: PR-6033 </p> </li> <li> <p>Optimized internal hash routines.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18131</p> </li> <li> <p> As announced when OTP 25 was released, <code>multi time warp mode</code> is now enabled by default. This assumes that all code executing on the system is <code>time warp safe</code>. </p> <p> If you have old code in the system that is not time warp safe, you now explicitly need to start the system in <code>no time warp mode</code> (or <code>singe time warp mode</code> if it is partially time warp safe) in order to avoid problems. When starting the system in no time warp mode, the system behaves as it did prior to the introduction of the extended time functionality introduced in OTP 18. </p> <p> If you have code that is not time warp safe, you are strongly encouraged to change this so that you can use multi time warp mode. Compared to no time warp mode, multi time warp mode improves scalability and performance as well as accuracy and precision of time measurements. </p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18135 Aux Id: GH-4965, PR-6046 </p> </li> <li> <p>There are several new optimization for binary syntax in the JIT:</p> <ul> <li>Creation and matching of binaries with segments of fixed sizes have been optimized.</li> <li>Creation and matching of UTF-8 segments have been optimized.</li> <li>Appending to binaries has been optimized.</li> </ul> <p> Own Id: OTP-18137 Aux Id: PR-6259, PR-6404, PR-6576, PR-6804 </p> </li> <li> <p>As announced since the release of OTP 24, support for:</p> <ul> <li><p> version 4 node container types in the external term format are now mandatory. That is, references supporting up to 5 32-bit integer identifiers, and process and port identifiers with support for 64-bit data storage. The distribution flag <code>DFLAG_V4_NC</code> is therefor now also mandatory. OTP has since OTP 24 supported this. Also note that the external format produced by <code>term_to_binary()</code> and <code>term_to_iovec()</code> will unconditionally produce pids, ports, and references supporting this larger format. </p></li> <li><p> the <code>new link protocol</code> introduced in OTP 23.3 is now mandatory. The distribution flag <code>DFLAG_UNLINK_ID</code> is therefor now also mandatory. </p></li> </ul> <p>Due to the above, OTP 26 nodes will refuse to connect to OTP nodes from releases prior to OTP 24.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18140 Aux Id: PR-6072 </p> </li> <li> <p>Optimization of <code><i>process aliases</i></code> made possible now that support for <code><a href="erl_dist_protocol.html#DFLAG_V4_NC">version 4 node container types</a></code> in the external term format is mandatory.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18141 Aux Id: OTP-18140, PR-6073 </p> </li> <li> <p>The compiler and JIT now generate better code for creation of small maps where all keys are literals known at compile time.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18185 Aux Id: GH-6139 </p> </li> <li> <p> When <code>erl -eval</code> fails to execute a command, an error description is printed to standard_error.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18227 Aux Id: PR-6254 </p> </li> <li> <p>Support for UTF-8 atoms and strings in the NIF interface including new functions <code>enif_make_new_atom</code>, <code>enif_make_new_atom_len</code> and <code>enif_get_string_length</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18334 Aux Id: PR-6434 </p> </li> <li> <p>The following <code>inet:setopts/2</code> options have been introduced:</p> <dl> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>reuseport</code></strong></dt> <dd><p>Reuse of local port. Load balancing may or may not be provided depending on underlying OS.</p></dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>reuseport_lb</code></strong></dt> <dd><p>Reuse of local port. Load balancing provided.</p></dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>exclusiveaddruse</code></strong></dt> <dd><p>Exclusive address/port usage on Windows. This socket option is Windows specific and will silently be ignored on other systems.</p></dd> </dl> <p>The behavior of setting <code>reuseaddr</code> on Windows have changed in a <strong>backwards incompatible</strong> way. The underlying <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> socket option is now only set if both the <code>reusaddr</code> and the <code>reuseport</code> <code>inet</code> options have been set. This since the underlying <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> socket option on Windows behaves similar to how BSD behaves if both the underlying socket options <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> and <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> have been set. See the documentation of the <code>reuseaddr</code> option for more information.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18344 Aux Id: PR-6522, PR-6944, OTP-18324, PR-6481, GH-6461 </p> </li> <li> <p><code>erlang:display/1</code> will now print large maps in a more readable way (similar to how small maps are printed).</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18360 Aux Id: PR-6497 </p> </li> <li> <p>The BIFs <code>min/2</code> and <code>max/2</code> are now allowed to be used in guards and match specs.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18367 Aux Id: GH-6544 </p> </li> <li> <p> Fail <code>enif_init_resource_type</code> and friends by returning NULL if not called during load/upgrade. Old behavior was undefined.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18369</p> </li> <li> <p> New option <code>include_shared_binaries</code> for the <code>max_heap_size</code> process limit. If set to <code>true</code>, large binaries (&gt; 64 bytes), which may be referred by several processes, are included in the memory sum compared against the <code>max_heap_size</code> limit.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18410 Aux Id: GH-5889, PR-6345 </p> </li> <li> <p>Map comprehensions as suggested in EEP 58 has now been implemented.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18413 Aux Id: EEP-58, PR-6727 </p> </li> <li> <p>Some map operations have been optimized by changing the internal sort order of atom keys. This changes the (undocumented) order of how atom keys in small maps are printed and returned by <code>maps:to_list/1</code> and <code>maps:next/1</code>. The new order is unpredictable and may change between different invocations of the Erlang VM.</p> <p>For applications where order is important, there is a new function <code>maps:iterator/2</code> for creating iterators that return the map elements in a deterministic order. There are also new modifiers <code>k</code> and <code>K</code> for the format string for <code>io:format()</code> to support printing map elements ordered.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18414 Aux Id: PR-6151 </p> </li> <li> <p>Reduced memory usage of <code>file:read_file_info/1,2</code></p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18424 Aux Id: PR-6716 </p> </li> <li> <p>Add new function <code>current_stacktrace</code> for trace match specifications used by <code>erlang:trace_pattern/3</code>. </p> <p> This new option puts the current stacktrace of the caller into the trace message sent to the trace receiver.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18425 Aux Id: PR-6628, GH-5333 </p> </li> <li> <p> The amount of significant bits in node local process identifiers and port identifiers has been extended from 28 bits to 60 bits on 64-bit runtime systems. This makes these identifiers large enough to in practice never having to be reused during the life time of a node.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18435 Aux Id: PR-6827 </p> </li> <li> <p> New trace feature <code>call_memory</code>. Similar to <code>call_time</code> tracing, but instead of measure accumulated time in traced functions it measures accumulated heap space consumed by traced functions. It can be used to compare how much different functions are contributing to garbage collection being triggered.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18440 Aux Id: PR-6351 </p> </li> <li> <p>It is no longer necessary to enable a feature in the runtime system in order to load modules that are using it. It is sufficient to enable the feature in the compiler when compiling it.</p> <p>That means that to use feature <code>maybe_expr</code> in Erlang/OTP 26, it is sufficient to enable it during compilation.</p> <p>In Erlang/OTP 27, feature <code>maybe_expr</code> will be enabled by default, but it will be possible to disable it.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18445</p> </li> <li> <p> Handling of <code>on_load</code> modules during boot has been improved by adding an extra step in the boot order for embedded mode that runs all <code>on_load</code> handlers, instead of relying on explicit invocation of them, later, when the kernel supervision tree starts. </p> <p> This is mostly a code improvement and OTP internal simplification to avoid future bugs and to simplify code maintenance. </p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18447</p> </li> <li> <p> Introduced the <code>local</code> option of <code>term_to_binary/2</code> and <code>term_to_iovec/2</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18477 Aux Id: PR-7006 </p> </li> <li> <p> Document the commonly used practice to create and store static atoms at NIF load time in callbacks <code>load</code> or <code>upgrade</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18483 Aux Id: PR-6888 </p> </li> <li> <p> Optimize <code>ets:lookup_element</code> for uncompressed tables by using a more efficient method to copy the term from ETS to the heap of the calling process.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18493 Aux Id: PR-6272 </p> </li> <li> <p>The default encoding of atoms by <code>term_to_binary</code> and <code>term_to_iovec</code> have changed from Latin1 to UTF-8. The old encoding can still be obtained with options <code>{minor_version, 1}</code>.</p> <p>Apart from encoding code points between 128 and 255 with two bytes (UTF-8) instead of one, most atoms will occupy one less byte as the length field use only one byte instead of two if possible.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18505 Aux Id: PR-6991 </p> </li> <li> <p> The version of zlib included in the Erlang/OTP source code is now 1.2.13.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18517</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>gen_tcp:send/*</code>, <code>gen_udp:send/*</code> and <code>gen_sctp:send/*</code> have been optimized to use the infamous receive reference optimization, so now sending should not have bad performance when the calling process has a large message queue.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18520 Aux Id: GH-6455 </p> </li> <li> <p>Added the new built-in type <code>dynamic()</code> introduced in EEP-61, improving support for gradual type checkers.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18522</p> </li> <li> <p> Optimize <code>maps:merge/2</code> memory consumption for small maps (&lt;33 keys) by reusing key tuples or entire maps if the result map has the same number of keys as any of the argument maps.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18523 Aux Id: PR-7004 </p> </li> <li> <p> Optimize <code>maps:merge/2</code> memory consumption further for small maps by mutating 2nd map to use literal key tuple of 1st map if both have the same keys.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18524 Aux Id: PR-7004, OTP-18523 </p> </li> <li> <p><code>ceil/1</code>, <code>floor/1</code>, <code>is_bitstring/1</code>, <code>is_boolean/1</code>, <code>is_function/2</code>, and <code>tuple_size/1</code> can now be used in match specifications.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18526 Aux Id: GH-7045 </p> </li> <li> <p> Allow IPv6 addresses as host in <code>http</code> packets decoded by <code>erlang:decode_packet/3</code> and <code>gen_tcp</code> packet option. The IPv6 address should be enclosed within <code>[]</code> according to RFC2732.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18540 Aux Id: PR-6900 </p> </li> <li> <p> Removed the experimental <code>erts_alloc_config</code> module. It no longer produced good configurations and cannot be fixed in a reasonably backwards compatible manner. It has since OTP 25 been deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 26.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18549 Aux Id: PR-7105 </p> </li> <li> <p> ERTS internal thread names have been changed. All threads created by ERTS now have a prefix <code>erts_</code> followed by a type name potentially followed by an integer index. For example, normal schedulers are now named <code>erts_sched_&lt;IX&gt;</code>, dirty CPU schedulers <code>erts_dcpus_&lt;IX&gt;</code>, and dirty IO schedulers <code>erts_dios_&lt;IX&gt;</code>. NIF and driver thread names are truncated at 15 characters regardless of whether the underlying platform support more characters or not.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18552 Aux Id: PR-6973 </p> </li> <li> <p> Further robustify implementation of large maps (&gt; 32 keys). Keys that happen to have same internal 32-bit hash values are now put in collision nodes which are traversed with linear search. This removes the demand for the internal hash function when salted to eventually produce different hashes for all possible pairs of unequal terms.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18569</p> </li> <li> <p>In Erlang/OTP 27, <code>0.0</code> will no longer be considered to be exactly equal to <code>-0.0</code>.

This could only occur if the runtime system was communicated such pids, ports, or references prior to the distribution was started. That is, it was extremely unlikely to happen unless the distribution was started dynamically and was even then very unlikely to happen. The runtime system now checks for already existing pids, ports, and references with the same nodename/creation pair that it is about to use.

However, there are no ordering guarantees for signals sent from different processes to a particular process. Therefore, several processes can send signals in parallel to a specific process without synchronizing with each other. However, such signal sending was previously always serialized as the senders had to acquire the lock for the outer signal queue of the receiving process. This parallel signal sending optimization yields much better scalability for signal sending than what was previously possible, see https://erlang.org/bench/sigq_bench_result.html for benchmark results.</p> <p> * Information about how to enable the message_queue_data=off_heap setting can be found in the documentation of the function erlang:process_flag/2.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-16982 Aux Id: PR-5020 </p> </li> <li> <p>The JIT now works for 64-bit ARM processors.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-17119 Aux Id: PR-4869 </p> </li> <li> <p> Added support for the compile attribute <code>-nifs()</code> to empower compiler and loader with information about which functions may be overridden as NIFs by <code>erlang:load_nif/2</code>.

This is problematic for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such as for example <code>mnesia</code>, but also for <code>global</code> itself. A network of overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of <code>global</code> to become inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during such a partitioning. </p> <p> In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a <i>prevent overlapping partitions</i> fix which can be enabled using the <code>prevent_overlapping_partitions</code> <code>kernel(6)</code> parameter. When this fix has been enabled, <code>global</code> will actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping partitions. Note that this fix <i>has</i> to be enabled on <i>all</i> nodes in the network in order to work properly. Since this quite substantially changes the behavior, this fix is currently disabled by default. Since you might get hard to detect issues without this fix you are, however, <i>strongly</i> advised to enable this fix in order to avoid issues such as the ones described above.

This is problematic for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such as for example <code>mnesia</code>, but also for <code>global</code> itself. A network of overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of <code>global</code> to become inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during such a partitioning. </p> <p> In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a <i>prevent overlapping partitions</i> fix which can be enabled using the <code>prevent_overlapping_partitions</code> <code>kernel(6)</code> parameter. When this fix has been enabled, <code>global</code> will actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping partitions. Note that this fix <i>has</i> to be enabled on <i>all</i> nodes in the network in order to work properly.

This is problematic for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such as for example <code>mnesia</code>, but also for <code>global</code> itself. A network of overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of <code>global</code> to become inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during such a partitioning. </p> <p> In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a <i>prevent overlapping partitions</i> fix which can be enabled using the <code>prevent_overlapping_partitions</code> <code>kernel(6)</code> parameter. When this fix has been enabled, <code>global</code> will actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping partitions. Note that this fix <i>has</i> to be enabled on <i>all</i> nodes in the network in order to work properly. Since this quite substantially changes the behavior, this fix is currently disabled by default. Since you might get hard to detect issues without this fix you are, however, <i>strongly</i> advised to enable this fix in order to avoid issues such as the ones described above.

Notable incompatibilities are:</p> <ul> <li><p>The <code>use_threads</code> option for <code>file:sendfile/5</code> no longer has any effect; we either use non-blocking <code>sendfile(2)</code> or fall back to <code>file:read</code> + <code>gen_tcp:send</code>. </p></li> <li><p>The file-specific DTrace probes have been removed. The same effect can be achieved with normal tracing together with the <code>nif__entry</code>/<code>nif__return</code> probes to track scheduling.</p></li> </ul> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14256</p> </li> <li> <p>The I/O polling functionality of erts has been re-written to better make use of the OSs polling mechanisms. This change means that erts will now always prefer to use a kernel-polling mechanism if possible. Also all of the I/O polling has been moved to dedicated threads instead of being placed in the scheduler loops.</p> <p>As a result of this, the <code>erl</code> options <code>+K</code> and <code>+secio</code> have been removed. It is still possible to disable kernel-poll, but it has to be done at compile time through the configure option <code>--disable-kernel-poll</code>.</p> <p>The new <code>erl</code> options <code><a href="erl.html#+IOt">+IOt</a></code> and <code><a href="erl.html#+IOp">+IOp</a></code> can be used to change how many IO poll threads and poll sets that erts should use. See their respective documentation for more details.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14346</p> </li> <li> <p>Truly asynchronous auto-connect. Earlier, when <code>erlang:send</code> was aimed toward an unconnected node, the function would not return until the connection setup had completed (or failed). Now the function returns directly after the message has been enqueued and the connection setup started.</p> <p>The same applies to all distributed operations that may trigger auto-connect, i.e. <code>'!'</code>, <code>send</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>monitor</code>, <code>monitor_node</code>, <code>exit/2</code> and <code>group_leader</code>.</p> <p>The interface for all these functions are unchanged as they do not return connection failures. The only exception is <code>erlang:monitor</code> where a <strong>possible incompatibility</strong> is introduced: An attempt to monitor a process on a primitive node (such as erl_interface or jinterface), where remote process monitoring is not implemented, will no longer fail with <code>badarg</code> exception. Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only supervise the connection to the node.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14370</p> </li> <li> <p>Changed the default behaviour of <code>.erlang</code> loading: <code>.erlang</code> is no longer loaded from the current directory. <code>c:erlangrc(PathList)</code> can be used to search and load an <code>.erlang</code> file from user specified directories.</p> <p><code>escript</code>, <code>erlc</code>, <code>dialyzer</code> and <code>typer</code> no longer load an <code>.erlang</code> at all.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14439</p> </li> <li> <p> New functionality for implementation of alternative carriers for the Erlang distribution has been introduced. This mainly consists of support for usage of distribution controller processes (previously only ports could be used as distribution controllers). For more information see <code>ERTS User's Guide ➜ How to implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang Distribution ➜ Distribution Module</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14459</p> </li> <li> <p> Add support for the lcc compiler and in extension the Elbrus 2000 platform.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14492</p> </li> <li> <p>Support for "tuple calls" have been removed from the run-time system. Tuple calls was an undocumented and unsupported feature which allowed the module argument for an apply operation to be a tuple: <code>Var = dict:new(), Var:size()</code>. This "feature" frequently caused confusion, especially when such call failed. The stacktrace would point out functions that don't exist in the source code.</p> <p>For legacy code that need to use parameterized modules or tuple calls for some other reason, there is a new compiler option called <code>tuple_calls</code>. When this option is given, the compiler will generate extra code that emulates the old behavior for calls where the module is a variable.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14497</p> </li> <li> <p>Creation of small maps with literal keys has been optimized to be faster and potentially use less memory. The keys are combined into a literal key tuple which is put into the literal pool. The key tuple can be shared between many instances of maps having the same keys.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14502</p> </li> <li> <p> When an exception is thrown, include the arguments of the call in the stacktrace for BIFs <code>band</code>, <code>bor</code>, <code>bsl</code>, <code>bsr</code>, <code>bxor</code>, <code>div</code>, <code>rem</code> and the operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code>.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14508</p> </li> <li> <p> The non-smp emulators have been removed. This means that the configure options <code>--disable-threads</code> and <code>--enable-plain-emulator</code> have been removed and configure will now refuse to build Erlang/OTP on platforms without thread support.</p> <p> In order to achieve a similar setup as the non-smp emulator, it is possible to start Erlang/OTP with the <code>+S 1</code> option.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14518</p> </li> <li> <p>Modules that use floating point constants compiled with R15 or earlier will need to be re-compiled before they can be loaded.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14575</p> </li> <li> <p> Implementation of true asynchronous signaling between processes in order to improve scalability. Signals affected include exit, monitor, demonitor, monitor triggered, link, unlink, and group leader.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14589</p> </li> <li> <p> Added a PGO (profile guided optimization) pass to the build step of erts. This can be disabled by passing --disable-pgo to configure.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14604</p> </li> <li> <p> Improved the performance of <code>binary:split</code> and <code>binary:match</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14610 Aux Id: PR-1480 </p> </li> <li> <p> It is not longer possible to disable dirty schedulers when building erlang.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14613</p> </li> <li> <p>Loaded BEAM code in a 64-bit system requires less memory because of better packing of operands for instructions.</p> <p>These memory savings were achieved by major improvements to the <code>beam_makeops</code> scripts used when building the run time system and BEAM compiler. There is also new for documentation for <code>beam_makeops</code> that describes how new BEAM instructions and loader transformations can be implemented. The documentation is found in here in a source directory or git repository: erts/emulator/internal_doc/beam_makeops.md. An online version can be found here: https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/erts/emulator/internal_doc/beam_makeops.md</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14626</p> </li> <li> <p><code>file:read_file</code> has been changed to read the content of files that report a size of 0 even when data can be read from them. An example of such a file is <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> on Linux.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14637 Aux Id: ERL-327 PR-1524 </p> </li> <li> <p> It is no longer possible to disable the <code>temp_alloc</code> allocator. Disabling it caused serious performance degradations and was never what was wanted.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14651</p> </li> <li> <p>The reduction cost of sending messages is now constant. It will no longer scale according to the length of the receiving process' message queue.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14667</p> </li> <li> <p> Improved loading of modules with <code>-on_load</code> directive, to no longer block all schedulers when the load operation is completed.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14680</p> </li> <li> <p> On platforms with real-time signals available, SIGRTMIN+1 is now used as the internal scheduler suspend signal instead of SIGUSR2.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14682</p> </li> <li> <p>When the value returned from a '<code>catch</code>' expression is ignored, no stacktrace will be built if an exception is caught. That will save time and produce less garbage. There are also some minor optimizations of '<code>try</code>/<code>catch</code>' both in the compiler and run-time system.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14683</p> </li> <li> <p>The guarantees and non-guarantees of <code>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</code> are now documented.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14687</p> </li> <li> <p>There is a new syntax in '<code>try/catch</code>' for retrieving the stacktrace without calling '<code>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</code>'. See the reference manual for a description of the new syntax. The '<code>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</code>' BIF is now deprecated.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14692</p> </li> <li> <p> New 'used' option for <code>binary_to_term/2</code> that will also return number of bytes actually read from the binary. This enables easy access to any extra data in the binary located directly after the returned term.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14780</p> </li> <li> <p> Added more statistics for <code>erlang:system_info({allocator,A})</code> in the <code>mbcs_pool</code> section.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14795 Aux Id: ERL-88 </p> </li> <li> <p>Added <code>enif_ioq_peek_head</code> to retrieve Erlang terms from NIF IO queues without having to resort to copying.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14797</p> </li> <li> <p>There is a new option '<code>makedep_side_effect</code>' for the compiler and <code>-MMD</code> for '<code>erlc</code>' that generates dependencies and continues to compile as normal.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14830</p> </li> <li> <p>Added <code>ets:whereis/1</code> for retrieving the table identifier of a named table.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14884</p> </li> <li> <p><code>seq_trace</code> labels may now be any erlang term.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14899</p> </li> <li> <p> Optimized the common case of <code>monitor</code> followed by <code>send</code> to the same local process. The monitor signal is now delayed in order to be piggybacked with the sent message and thereby only get one lock operation on the message queue of the receiver. A delayed monitor signal is flushed if no <code>send</code> has been done at the latest when the process is scheduled out.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14901</p> </li> <li> <p> Make hipe compiled code work on x86_64 (amd64) with OS security feature PIE, where executable code can be loaded into a random location. Old behavior, if hipe was enabled, was to disable PIE build options for the VM.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14903</p> </li> <li> <p>The number of driver async threads will now default to 1 as the standard drivers do not use them anymore. Users that changed this value to tweak the file driver should replace <code>+A</code> with <code>+SDio</code> since it now uses dirty IO schedulers instead of async threads.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14928</p> </li> <li> <p> Optimize <code>==</code> and <code>/=</code> for binaries with different sizes to be constant in time instead of proportional to the size of their common prefix.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14934 Aux Id: PR-1708 </p> </li> <li> <p> Refactorings making some internal process flags available for other usage.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14948</p> </li> <li> <p> Removed need for HiPE to allocate native executable memory in low 2GB address space on x86_64. Command line option <code>+MXscs</code> is thereby obsolete and ignored.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14951</p> </li> <li> <p>Added <code>enif_make_map_from_arrays</code> for creating a populated map, analogous to <code>enif_make_list_from_array</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14954</p> </li> <li> <p>Added configuration switches for busy-wait and wake up thresholds for dirty schedulers, and changing these settings for normal schedulers will no longer affect dirty schedulers. </p> <p>Refer to the documentation for details. The new switches are <code><a href="erl.html#+sbwtdcpu">+sbwtdcpu</a></code>, <code><a href="erl.html#+sbwtdio">+sbwtdio</a></code>, <code><a href="erl.html#+swtdcpu">+swtdcpu</a></code>, and <code><a href="erl.html#+swtdio">+swtdio</a></code>.</p> <p>The default busy wait threshold for dirty scheduler threads has also been lowered to <code>short</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14959</p> </li> <li> <p> The list of "taints" now also includes dynamic loaded drivers in addition to NIF libraries. Statically linked drivers and NIF libraries that are part of erts are not included. The "taints" are returned by <code>system_info(taints)</code> and printed in the header of <code>erl_crash.dump</code> files.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14960</p> </li> <li> <p>Added <code>instrument:allocations</code> and <code>instrument:carriers</code> for retrieving information about memory utilization and fragmentation.</p> <p>The old <code>instrument</code> interface has been removed, as have the related options <code>+Mim</code> and <code>+Mis</code>.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14961</p> </li> <li> <p>The process suspend functionality used by the <code><a href="erlang.html#suspend_process-2">erlang:suspend_process/2</a></code> BIF has been reimplemented using the newly introduced true asynchronous signaling between processes. This mainly to reduce memory usage in the process control block of all processes, but also in order to simplify the implementation.</p> <div class="warning"> <div class="label">Warning</div> <div class="content">

<p>You can easily create deadlocks if processes suspends each other (directly or in circles). In ERTS versions prior to ERTS version 10.0, the runtime system prevented such deadlocks, but this prevention has now been removed due to performance reasons.</p> </div> </div> <p>Other ERTS internal functionality that used the previous process suspend functionality have also been reimplemented to use asynchronous signaling instead.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14964 Aux Id: OTP-14589 </p> </li> <li> <p>Added the <code>nifs</code> option to <code>?MODULE:module_info/1</code> for listing a module's installed NIF functions.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14965</p> </li> <li> <p> New implementation of <code>erlang:process_info/[1,2]</code>.</p> <p> In the general case when inspecting another process, the new implementation sends an asynchronous process-info request signal to the other process and waits for the result instead of locking the other process and reading the result directly. In some special cases where no conflicts occur, signal order won't be violated, and the amount of data requested is guaranteed to be small, the inspected process may be inspected directly.</p> <p> Appropriate amount of reductions are now also bumped when inspecting a process.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14966</p> </li> <li> <p> Removed process start time from crash dump in order to save memory in process control block.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14975 Aux Id: PR-1597 </p> </li> <li> <p> Optimize <code>erlang:put/2</code> when updating existing key with a new immediate value (atom, small integer, pid, port).</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14976</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>erlang:process_info/1</code> has been changed to no longer include <code>messages</code> by default.

It used to be that a hand-made stack backtrace passed to <code>erlang:raise/3</code> would be be truncated to an empty list.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-15026</p> </li> <li> <p> Fixed bug for named <code>ets</code> tables which could cause unexpected results from matchspec iteration functions (<code>ets:select*</code> and <code>ets:match*</code>) if the table was deleted and recreated with the same name during the iteration. The iteration could incorrectly continue through the recreated table. The expected correct behavior is now for the iteration call to fail with a <code>badarg</code> exception if the table is deleted before the iteration has completed.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-15031</p> </li> <li> <p>Two new guards BIFs operating on maps have been added: <code>map_get/2</code> and <code>is_map_key/2</code>. They do the same as <code>maps:get/2</code> and <code>maps:is_key/2</code>, respectively, except that they are allowed to be used in guards.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-15037 Aux Id: PR-1784, PR-1802 </p> </li> <li> <p> Release run-queue lock while cleaning up terminated dirty process.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-15081</p> </li> <li> <p>The callback module passed as <code>-epmd_module</code> to erl has been expanded to be able to do name and port resolving.</p> <p>Documentation has also been added in the <code>erl_epmd</code> reference manual and ERTS User's Guide <code>How to Implement an Alternative Node Discovery for Erlang Distribution</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-15086 Aux Id: PR-1694 </p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="erts-9.3.3.15" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">1.161 Erts 9.3.3.15</div>  </h2> <h3 id="fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</div>  </h3> <ul> <li> <p> A process could end up in a state where it got endlessly rescheduled without making any progress.

It has been marked as deprecated since OTP R15B. This means that you are only allowed to do one successful call to <code>erlang:load_nif/2</code> for each module instance. A second call to <code>erlang:load_nif/2</code> will return <code>{error, {reload, _}}</code> even if the NIF library implements the <code>reload</code> callback.</p> <p> Runtime upgrade of a NIF library is still supported by using the Erlang module upgrade mechanics with a current and an old module instance existing at the same time with their corresponding NIF libraries.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13908</p> </li> <li> <p> Add <code>erlang:system_info(atom_count)</code> and <code>erlang:system_info(atom_limit)</code> to provide a way to retrieve the current and maximum number of atoms.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13976</p> </li> <li> <p>The function <code>fmod/2</code> has been added to the <code>math</code> module.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14000</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>erlang:load_nif/2</code> returns new error type <code>notsup</code> when called for a HiPE compiled module, which is not supported.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14002</p> </li> <li> <p> Add driver and nif lock instrumentation to lcnt</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14069</p> </li> <li> <p> Reduce memory pressure by converting sub-binaries to heap-binaries when possible.

All garbage collections that potentially will take a long time to complete are now performed on dirty schedulers if enabled.</p> <p> <code>erlang:statistics/1</code> with arguments inspecting scheduler and run queue states have been changed due to the dirty scheduler support. Code using this functionality may have to be rewritten taking these incompatibilities into consideration. Examples of such uses are calls to <code>erlang:statistics(scheduler_wall_time)</code>, <code>statistics(total_run_queue_lengths)</code>, <code>statistics(total_active_tasks)</code>, etc.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14152</p> </li> <li> <p>Atoms may now contain arbitrary Unicode characters.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14178</p> </li> <li> <p> Introduce an event manager in Erlang to handle OS signals.

Instead the <code>escript</code>s can be referred to via symbolic links from a bin directory in the path.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14201 Aux Id: PR-1293 </p> </li> <li> <p> All uses of the magic binary kludge has been replaced by uses of erlang references.</p> <p> A magic binary was presented as an empty binary, but actually referred other data internally in the Erlang VM. Since they were presented as empty binaries, different magic binaries compared as equal, and also lost their internal data when passed out of an erlang node.</p> <p> The new usage of references has not got any of these strange semantic issues, and the usage of these references has been optimized to give the same performance benefits as well as memory usage benefits as magic binaries had.</p> <p> A couple of examples of previous uses of magic binaries are match specifications and NIF resources.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14205</p> </li> <li> <p> The non-smp emulators have been deprecated and are scheduled for removal in OTP-21.</p> <p> In preparation for this, the threaded non-smp emulator is no longer built by default and has to be enabled using the --enable-plain-emulator to configure.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14272</p> </li> <li> <p> Allow HiPE to run on VM built with <code>--enable-m32-build</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14330 Aux Id: PR-1397 </p> </li> <li> <p> Upgraded the OTP internal PCRE library from version 8.33 to version 8.40. This library is used for implementation of the <code>re</code> regular expressions module.</p> <p> Besides various bug fixes, the new version allows for better stack protection. In order to utilize this feature, the stack size of normal scheduler threads is now by default set to 128 kilo words on all platforms. The stack size of normal scheduler threads can be set upon system start by passing the <code>+sss</code> command line argument to the <code>erl</code> command.</p> <p> See <code><a href="http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt">http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt</a></code> for information about changes made to PCRE between the versions 8.33 and 8.40.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14331 Aux Id: ERL-208 </p> </li> <li> <p> Remove generation of atoms in old latin1 external format in the distribution between erlang nodes, <code>erl_interface</code>, and <code>jinterface</code>. The new utf8 format for atoms was introduced in OTP R16. An OTP 20 node can therefore not connect to nodes older than R16.</p> <p> Atoms that can be encoded using latin1 are still encoded by <code>term_to_binary()</code> using latin1 encoding. Note that all atoms will by default be encoded using utf8 in a future Erlang/OTP release. For more information see the documentation of <code>erlang:term_to_binary/2</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14337</p> </li> <li> <p> Added function <code>re:version/0</code> which returns information about the OTP internal PCRE version used for implementation of the <code>re</code> module.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14347 Aux Id: PR-1412 </p> </li> <li> <p> Added new debug bif <code>erlang:list_to_port/1</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14348</p> </li> <li> <p> Various improvements of timer management internally in the VM.

The <code><a href="erl_tracer.html">tracer module</a></code> makes it possible for trace tools to filter or manipulate trace event data without the trace event first having to be copied from the traced process or port.</p> <p> With the introduction of this feature, <code>erlang:trace(all|existing, _, _)</code> now also returns the tracer process as part of the number of processes on which tracing is enabled.

The process and port information functions have also been updated to include information about monitors from processes to ports.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-11384</p> </li> <li> <p> Add microstate accounting</p> <p> Microstate accounting is a way to track which state the different threads within ERTS are in. The main usage area is to pin point performance bottlenecks by checking which states the threads are in and then from there figuring out why and where to optimize.</p> <p> Since checking whether microstate accounting is on or off is relatively expensive only a few of the states are enabled by default and more states can be enabled through configure.</p> <p> There is a convenience module called msacc that has been added to runtime_tools that can assist in gathering and interpreting the data from Microstate accounting.</p> <p> For more information see <code>erlang:statistics(microstate_accounting, _)</code> and the <code>msacc</code> module in runtime_tools.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12345</p> </li> <li> <p> The port of Erlang/OTP to the real-time operating system OSE has been removed.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12573</p> </li> <li> <p> Sharing preserved copy for messages and exit signals</p> <p> Enable sharing preserved copy with configure option <code>--enable-sharing-preserving</code>. This will preserve sharing, within the process, when communication with other processes in the Erlang node. There is a trade-off, the copy is more costly but this cost can be reclaimed if there is a lot of sharing in the message. In addition literals will not be copied in a send except during a purge phase of the module where the literals are located. This feature is considered experimental in 19.0.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12590 Aux Id: OTP-10251 </p> </li> <li> <p> Halfword BEAM has been removed.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12883</p> </li> <li> <p> Added <code>os:perf_counter/1</code>.</p> <p> The perf_counter is a very very cheap and high resolution timer that can be used to timestamp system events. It does not have monoticity guarantees, but should on most OS's expose a monotonous time.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12908</p> </li> <li> <p> Support for a fragmented young heap generation. That is, the young heap generation can consist of multiple non continuous memory areas. The main reason for this change is to avoid extra copying of messages that could not be allocated directly on the receivers heap.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13047</p> </li> <li> <p> Erlang linked-in driver can now force the call to open_port to block until a call to erl_drv_init_ack is made inside the driver. This is useful when you want to do some asynchronous initialization, for example getting configuration from a pipe, and you want the initial open_port call to fail if the configuration is incomplete or wrong. See the erl_driver documentation for more details on the API.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13086</p> </li> <li> <p> Erlang linked-in drivers can now set their own pids as seen in <code>erlang:port_info/1</code> by using the <code>erl_drv_set_pid</code> function. For more details see the erl_driver documentation.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13087</p> </li> <li> <p> The functionality behind <code>erlang:open_port/2</code> when called with spawn or spawn_executable has been redone so that the forking of the new program is done in a separate process called erl_child_setup. This allows for a much more robust implementation that uses less memory and does not block the entire emulator if the program to be started is on an un-accessible NFS. Benchmarks have shown this approach to be about 3-5 times as fast as the old approach where the fork/vfork was done by erts. This is a pure stability and performance fix, however some error messages may have changed, which is why it is marked as a backwards incompatible change.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13088</p> </li> <li> <p>Improved yielding strategy in the implementation of the following native functions:</p> <ul> <li><code>erlang:binary_to_list/1</code></li> <li><code>erlang:binary_to_list/3</code></li> <li><code>erlang:bitstring_to_list/1</code></li> <li><code>erlang:list_to_binary/1</code></li> <li><code>erlang:iolist_to_binary/1</code></li> <li><code>erlang:list_to_bitstring/1</code></li> <li><code>binary:list_to_bin/1</code></li> </ul> <p>This in order to improve performance of these functions.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13096</p> </li> <li> <p> All garbage collections of processes now bump reductions.

The 'creation' value differentiates different incarnations of the same node (name).</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13488</p> </li> <li> <p> Don't send unasked for systemd notifications in epmd</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13493 Aux Id: PR-999 </p> </li> <li> <p> The enif_send API has been extended to allow NULL to be used as the message environment. When used this way, a message environment is implicitly created and the given term is copied into that environment before sending. This can be an optimization if many small messages are being sent by the nif.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13495</p> </li> <li> <p> The tracing support has been extended to allow tracing on ports. Ports can be traced on using the 'ports', 'send' and 'receive' trace flags.</p> <p> The first argument of <code>erlang:trace/3</code> has been extended so that <code>'all'</code>, <code>'existing'</code> and <code>'new'</code> now include both processes and ports. New <code>Tracee</code> variants, <code>'all_processes'</code>, <code>'all_ports'</code>, <code>'existing_processes'</code> etc have been added to specify only processes or ports.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13496</p> </li> <li> <p> When the <code>'procs'</code> trace flag is enabled, a <code>'spawned'</code> trace event is now also generated by a newly created process. The previous event <code>'spawn'</code> remains, but as it is generated by the process that did the spawn, it is not guaranteed that it is ordered with other trace events from the newly spawned process. So when tracking the lifetime of a process this new event should be used as the creation event.</p> <p> This new trace event is marked as an incompatibility because tools that expect certain trace events when enabling 'procs' will have to updated.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13497</p> </li> <li> <p> Add the <code>erlang:match_spec_test/3</code> function. The functions allows the testing of match specifications for both tracing and ets tables. It can be used to test that a match specification does the expected filtering on specific data. It also returns more verbose error reasons for incorrectly constructed match specifications.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13501</p> </li> <li> <p> The erts internal tracing support has been changed to have much less overhead and be more scalable.</p> <p> This rewrite does not break any backwards incompatibilities, but it does change the ordering of some trace messages when compared to previous releases. It should be noted that this only applies to trace messages sent to processes or ports, it does not apply to the new tracer module. However in future releases they may also be effected by this.</p> <p> Trace messages are only guaranteed to be ordered from one traced process or port. In previous releases this was not visible as a <code>'send'</code> trace message would always arrive before the corresponding <code>'receive'</code> trace message that is no longer always the case. This also means that timestamped trace messages may seem to arrive out of order as the timestamp is taken when the event is triggered and not when it is put in the queue of the tracer.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13503</p> </li> <li> <p> Add possibility to filter <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> trace with match specifications.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13507</p> </li> <li> <p> Add <code>maps:update_with/3,4</code> and <code>maps:take/2</code></p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13522 Aux Id: PR-1025 </p> </li> <li> <p> Introduce LTTng tracing via Erlang tracing.</p> <p> For LTTng to be enabled OTP needs to be built with configure option <code>--with-dynamic-trace=lttng</code>.</p> <p>The dynamic trace module <code>dyntrace</code> is now capable to be used as a LTTng sink for Erlang tracing. For a list of all tracepoints, see <code>Runtime Tools User's Guide</code> .</p> <p>This feature also introduces an incompatible change in trace tags. The trace tags <code>gc_start</code> and <code>gc_end</code> has been split into <code>gc_minor_start</code>, <code>gc_minor_end</code> and <code>gc_major_start</code>, <code>gc_major_end</code>.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13532</p> </li> <li> <p> Print heap pointers for garbing processes during crashdump</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-13541 Aux Id: PR-1026 </p> </li> <li> <p> Changed and improved low level memory statistics returned by <code>erlang:system_info/1</code>.

For more information see the <code><a href="time_correction.html">Time and Time Correction</a></code> chapter of the ERTS User's Guide.</p> <p>Besides the API changes and time warp modes a lot of scalability and performance improvements regarding time management has been made internally in the runtime system.

The change will occur when a Map reaches 33 pairs in size but this limit might change in the future.</p> <p>The most significant impact for the user by this change is speed, and to a lesser degree memory consumption and introspection of Maps. Memory consumption size is probalistic but lesser than <code>gb_trees</code> or <code>dict</code> for instance. Any other impacts will be transparent for the user except for the following changes.</p> <p>Semantics of Maps have changed in two incompatible ways compared to the experimental implementation in OTP 17:</p> <ul> <li>Hashing of maps is done different by <code>erlang:phash2/1,2</code>, <code>erlang:phash/1</code> and <code>erlang:hash/2</code>.</li> <li>Comparing two maps with ==, /=, =&lt;, &lt;, &gt;= and &gt;, is done different if the keys contain floating point numbers.</li> </ul> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12585</p> </li> <li> <p> Scalability improvement for <code><a href="erlang.html#make_ref-0">erlang:make_ref/0</a></code>, and other functionality that create references. Each scheduler now manage its own set of references. By this no communication at all is needed when creating references.</p> <p> Previous implementation generated a strictly monotonically increasing sequence of references corresponding to creation time on the runtime system instance. This is <strong>not</strong> the case with current implementation. You can only expect reference to be unique. The Erlang/OTP documentation has never mentioned anything else but the uniqueness property, so this change <strong>is</strong> fully compatible. The only reason we've marked this as a potential incompatibility is since an early draft for an Erlang specification mentions strict monotonicity as a property.</p> <p> If you need to create data with a strict monotonicity property use <code><a href="erlang.html#unique_integer-1">erlang:unique_integer([monotonic])</a></code>. Do <strong>not</strong> use the deprecated <code><a href="erlang.html#now-0">erlang:now()</a></code>.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12610</p> </li> <li> <p> Enable different abort signal from heart</p> <p>By using environment variable HEART_KILL_SIGNAL, heart can now use a different signal to kill the old running Erlang.</p> <p>By default the signal is SIGKILL but SIGABRT may also be used by setting environment variable: HEART_KILL_SIGNAL=SIGABRT</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12613 Aux Id: seq12826 </p> </li> <li> <p> Update autconf to latest version 2015-03-04</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12646</p> </li> <li> <p> Optimization of timers internally in the VM. This include process timers (<code>receive ... after</code>), port timers (<code>driver_set_timer()</code>) as well as BIF timers (<code>erlang:send_after()</code>/<code>erlang:start_timer()</code>).</p> <p> Each scheduler thread now has its own lock-free timer service instead of one locked central service. This dramatically improves performance of timer management on systems with a large amount of schedulers and timers.</p> <p> The timer service internal data structure has also been optimized to be able to handle more timers than before. That is, each timer service is by its self able to handle more timers without dramatic performance loss than the old centralized timer service.</p> <p> The API of BIF timers has also been extended. Timeout values are for example no longer limited to 32-bit integers. For more information see the documentation of <code><a href="erlang.html#start_timer-4">erlang:start_timer/4</a></code>, <code><a href="erlang.html#send_after-4">erlang:send_after/4</a></code>, <code><a href="erlang.html#cancel_timer-2">erlang:cancel_timer/2</a></code>, and <code><a href="erlang.html#read_timer-2">erlang:read_timer/2</a></code>.</p> <p> Characteristics impact: Calls to the synchronous versions of <code>erlang:cancel_timer()</code>, and <code>erlang:read_timer()</code> may take substantially longer time to complete than before. This occur when the timer that is accessed is managed by a remote scheduler. You typically want to use the new asynchronous option in order to avoid blocking the calling process.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12650 Aux Id: OTP-11997 </p> </li> <li> <p> Specialize instructions from common assembler patterns</p> <p>Specialize common instructions of <code>rem</code>, <code>band</code>, <code>minus</code> and <code>plus</code> in the beam loader. This will reduce the number of fetches and thus lessen the instruction dispatch pressure during runtime and speed up those operations in some common cases.</p> <p>Specialize move patterns from x-registers to the stack with a new <code>move_window</code> instruction.

This is the expected behaviour when shutdown() is called: the caller needs to be able to continue reading from the socket, not be prevented from doing so.</p> <p> It doesn't truncate the output. The current version of gen_tcp:shutdown/2 will truncate any outbound data in the driver queue after about 10 seconds if the TCP peer is idle of slow. Worse yet, it doesn't even inform anyone that the data has been truncated: 'ok' is returned to the caller; and a FIN rather than an RST is sent to the TCP peer.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12797</p> </li> <li> <p> Introduced delayed node table GC. This in order to avoid oscillation of entries in and out of the tables. The oscillation caused unnecessary lock contention on the table locks. The delay length can be set by passing the <code><a href="erl.html#+zdntgc">+zdntgc</a></code> command line argument.</p> <p> Characteristics impact: The tables can grow to very large sizes with unused entries if the node is get huge amounts of short lived connections from other nodes. This problem can be alleviated by shortening the length of the delay using the <code>+zdntgc</code> command line argument.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12802</p> </li> <li> <p>Improved implementation of <code><a href="erlang.html#statistics-1">erlang:statistics</a></code><code>(io)</code> in order to reduce contention between schedulers.</p> <p>Characteristics impact: The actual call to <code>erlang:statistics(io)</code> takes longer time to complete, but the overall impact on the system is improved.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-12842</p> </li> <li> <p> There are many cases where user code needs to be able to distinguish between a socket that was closed normally and one that was aborted.

This means, among other things, better Unicode and Unicode Character Properties support. New options connected to PCRE 8.33 are also added to the re module (ucd, notempty_atstart, no_start_optimize). PCRE has extended the regular expression syntax between 7.6 and 8.33, why this imposes a potential incompatibility.

At the moment only the asn1 and crypto nifs of the Erlang/OTP nifs and drivers have been prepared to be statically linked. For more details see the Installation Guide in the System documentation.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-11258</p> </li> <li> <p> Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating system OSE. The port supports both smp and non-smp emulator. For details around the port and how to started see the User's Guide in the <strong>ose</strong> application.</p> <p> Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported. </p> <p> Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators, OSE signal interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl, tcp, epmd, distribution and most if not all non-os specific functionality of Erlang.</p> <p> Notable things that does not work are: udp/sctp, os_mon, erl_interface, binding of schedulers.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-11334</p> </li> <li> <p> Add the {active,N} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP, where N is an integer in the range -32768..32767, to allow a caller to specify the number of data messages to be delivered to the controlling process. Once the socket's delivered message count either reaches 0 or is explicitly set to 0 with inet:setopts/2 or by including {active,0} as an option when the socket is created, the socket transitions to passive ({active, false}) mode and the socket's controlling process receives a message to inform it of the transition. TCP sockets receive {tcp_passive,Socket}, UDP sockets receive {udp_passive,Socket} and SCTP sockets receive {sctp_passive,Socket}. </p> <p> The socket's delivered message counter defaults to 0, but it can be set using {active,N} via any gen_tcp, gen_udp, or gen_sctp function that takes socket options as arguments, or via inet:setopts/2. New N values are added to the socket's current counter value, and negative numbers can be used to reduce the counter value. Specifying a number that would cause the socket's counter value to go above 32767 causes an einval error. If a negative number is specified such that the counter value would become negative, the socket's counter value is set to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode. If the counter value is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket, [{active,0}]) is specified, the counter value remains at 0 but the appropriate passive mode transition message is generated for the socket.</p> <p> Thanks to Steve Vinoski</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-11368</p> </li> <li> <p> A new optional scheduler utilization balancing mechanism has been introduced. For more information see the <code><a href="erl.html#+sub">+sub</a></code> command line argument.</p> <p> Characteristics impact: None, when not enabled. When enabled, changed timing in the system, normally a small overhead due to measuring of utilization and calculating balancing information. On some systems, such as old Windows systems, the overhead can be quite substantial. This time measurement overhead highly depend on the underlying primitives provided by the OS.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-11385</p> </li> <li> <p> A call to either the <code>garbage_collect/1</code> BIF or the <code>check_process_code/2</code> BIF may trigger garbage collection of another processes than the process calling the BIF. The previous implementations performed these kinds of garbage collections without considering the internal state of the process being garbage collected. In order to be able to more easily and more efficiently implement yielding native code, these types of garbage collections have been rewritten. A garbage collection like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request signal, the actual garbage collection is performed by the process being garbage collected itself, and finalized by a reply signal to the process issuing the request. Using this approach processes can disable garbage collection and yield without having to set up the heap in a state that can be garbage collected.</p> <p> The <code>garbage_collect/2</code>, and <code>check_process_code/3</code> BIFs have been introduced. Both taking an option list as last argument. Using these, one can issue asynchronous requests.</p> <p> <code>code:purge/1</code> and <code>code:soft_purge/1</code> have been rewritten to utilize asynchronous <code>check_process_code</code> requests in order to parallelize work.</p> <p> Characteristics impact: A call to the <code>garbage_collect/1</code> BIF or the <code>check_process_code/2</code> BIF will normally take longer time to complete while the system as a whole won't be as much negatively effected by the operation as before. A call to <code>code:purge/1</code> and <code>code:soft_purge/1</code> may complete faster or slower depending on the state of the system while the system as a whole won't be as much negatively effected by the operation as before.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-11388 Aux Id: OTP-11535, OTP-11648 </p> </li> <li> <p> Cleanup 'Buckets' and 'Time left' fields in crashdump to ease parsing.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-11419</p> </li> <li> <p> Add sync option to file:open/2.</p> <p> The sync option adds the POSIX O_SYNC flag to the open system call on platforms that support the flag or its equivalent, e.g., FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH on Windows. For platforms that don't support it, file:open/2 returns {error, enotsup} if the sync option is passed in.

This avoids too long schedules when binary_to_term is used. (Thanks to Svante Karlsson for the original patch)</p> <p> Impact: Programs running binary_to_term on large binaries will run more smoothly, but rescheduling will impact the single process performance of the BIF. Single threaded benchmarks might show degraded performance of the BIF, while general system behaviour will be improved.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-11535 Aux Id: OTP-11388 </p> </li> <li> <p> Added high resolution icon for windows.

For example, "+SP 50:25" sets the number of scheduler threads to 50% of the logical processors configured, and the number of scheduler threads online to 25% of the logical processors available. The +SP option also interacts with any settings specified with the +S option, such that the combination of options "+S 4:4 +SP 50:50" (in either order) results in 2 scheduler threads and 2 scheduler threads online.</p> <p> Thanks to Steve Vinoski</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-11282</p> </li> <li> <p> Extend erl_driver interface with lock names</p> <p> Lock and thread names are already a feature in the driver interface.

The most notable:</p> <dl> <dt class="title-link"><strong>Order of signal delivery</strong></dt> <dd>The previous implementation of the VM has delivered signals from processes to ports in a synchronous stricter fashion than required by the language. As of ERTS version 5.10, signals are truly asynchronously delivered. The order of signal delivery still adheres to the requirements of the language, but only to the requirements. That is, some signal sequences that previously always were delivered in one specific order may now from time to time be delivered in different orders. This may cause Erlang programs that have made <strong>false assumptions</strong> about signal delivery order to fail even though they previously succeeded. For more information about signal ordering guarantees, see the chapter on <code>communication</code> in the ERTS user's guide. The <code>+n</code> command line flag of <code>erl(1)</code> can be helpful when trying to find signaling order bugs in Erlang code that have been exposed by these changes.</dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong>Latency of signals sent from processes to ports</strong></dt> <dd>Signals from processes to ports where previously always delivered immediately. This kept latency for such communication to a minimum, but it could cause lock contention which was very expensive for the system as a whole. In order to keep this latency low also in the future, most signals from processes to ports are by default still delivered immediately as long as no conflicts occur. Such conflicts include not being able to acquire the port lock, but also include other conflicts. When a conflict occur, the signal will be scheduled for delivery at a later time. A scheduled signal delivery may cause a higher latency for this specific communication, but improves the overall performance of the system since it reduce lock contention between schedulers. The default behavior of only scheduling delivery of these signals on conflict can be changed by passing the <code>+spp</code> command line flag to <code>erl(1)</code>. The behavior can also be changed on port basis using the <code>parallelism</code> option of the <code>open_port/2</code> BIF.</dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong>Execution time of the <code>erlang:ports/0</code> BIF</strong></dt> <dd>Since <code>erlang:ports/0</code> now can be preempted, the responsiveness of the system as a whole has been improved. A call to <code>erlang:ports/0</code> may, however, take a much longer time to complete than before. How much longer time heavily depends on the system load.</dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong>Reduction cost of calling driver callbacks</strong></dt> <dd>Calling a driver callback is quite costly. This was previously not reflected in reduction cost at all. Since the reduction cost now has increased, a process performing lots of direct driver calls will be scheduled out more frequently than before.</dd> </dl> <p><strong>Potential incompatibilities</strong>:</p> <ul> <li> <code>driver_send_term()</code> has been deprecated and has been scheduled for removal in OTP-R17.

Thanks to Tuncer Ayaz and Sebastian Rasmussen.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-10733</p> </li> <li> <p> The runtime system will now by default use 10 async threads if thread support has been enabled when building the runtime system.</p> <p> This will prevent long blocking file-operations from blocking scheduler threads for long periods of time, which can be harmful. Apart from file-operations, it also effects other operations scheduled on the async thread pool by user implemented drivers.</p> <p> The amount of async threads can be controlled by using the <code><a href="erl.html#async_thread_pool_size">+A</a></code> command line argument of <code>erl(1)</code>. When running some offline tools you <strong>might</strong> want to disable async threads, but you are advised <strong>not</strong> to in the general case. Instead, you might want to increase the amount of async threads used.</p> <p> This change imply changes of the characteristics the system compared to the previous default. The responsiveness of the system as a whole will be improved. Operations scheduled on the async thread pool will get an increased latency. The throughput of these operations may increase, or decrease depending on the type of the operations and how they get scheduled. In the case of file operations, the throughput very much depends on how the Erlang application access files. Multiple concurrent accesses to different files have the potential of an increased throughput.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-10736</p> </li> <li> <p> The default reader group limit has been increased to 64 from 8. This limit can be set using the <code>+rg</code> command line argument of <code>erl(1)</code>.</p> <p> This change of default value will reduce lock contention on ETS tables using the <code>read_concurrency</code> option at the expense of memory consumption when the amount of schedulers and logical processors are between 8 and 64.

This has been changed to only take down the system just before inserting the loaded code into the system tables, resulting in a much shorter disruption if a module is loaded in a busy system. (Suggested by Bob Ippolito.)</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-9720</p> </li> <li> <p> Possible to run HiPE without floating point exceptions (FPE). Useful on platforms that lack reliable FPE.

However, if other operating system processes (as for example another Erlang runtime system) also bind threads to logical processors, there might be a performance penalty instead. In some cases this performance penalty might be severe. Due to this, we change the default so that the user must make an active decision in order to bind schedulers.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-9726</p> </li> <li> <p> The use of <code>erlang:system_flag(scheduler_bind_type, _)</code> and <code>erlang:system_flag(cpu_topology, _)</code> have been deprecated and scheduled for removal in erts-5.10/OTP-R16.

It can be enabled by giving the <code>--enable-halfword-emulator</code> option to the <code>configure</code> script.</p> <p>The halfword emulator is a 64-bit application, but uses halfwords (32-bit words) for all data in Erlang processes, therefore using less memory and being faster than the standard 64-bit emulator. The total size of all BEAM code and all process data for all processes is limited to 4Gb, but ETS tables and off-heap binaries are only limited by the amount of available memory.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-8941</p> </li> <li> <p> 32-bit atomic memory operations have been introduced internally in the run time system, and are now used where appropriate.

The feature is turned on by default on systems where Unicode filenames are mandatory (Windows and MacOSX), but can be enabled on other systems with the '+fnu' emulator option. Enabling the Unicode filename feature on systems where it is not default is however considered experimental and not to be used for production. Together with the Unicode file name support, the concept of "raw filenames" is introduced, which means filenames provided without implicit unicode encoding translation. Raw filenames are provided as binaries, not lists. For further information, see stdlib users guide and the chapter about using Unicode in Erlang.

This is a compatible change as old code can read full 32-bit integers but only produce 28-bit integers as INTEGER_EXT.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-8540 Aux Id: seq11534 </p> </li> <li> <p> Large parts of the <code>ethread</code> library have been rewritten. The <code>ethread</code> library is an Erlang runtime system internal, portable thread library used by the runtime system itself.</p> <p> Most notable improvement is a reader optimized rwlock implementation which dramatically improve the performance of read-lock/read-unlock operations on multi processor systems by avoiding ping-ponging of the rwlock cache lines. The reader optimized rwlock implementation is used by miscellaneous rwlocks in the runtime system that are known to be read-locked frequently, and can be enabled on ETS tables by passing the <code>{read_concurrency, true}</code> option upon table creation. See the documentation of <code>ets:new/2</code> for more information. The reader optimized rwlock implementation can be fine tuned when starting the runtime system. For more information, see the documentation of the <code>+rg</code> command line argument of <code>erl</code>.</p> <p> There is also a new implementation of rwlocks that is not optimized for readers. Both implementations interleaves readers and writers during contention as opposed to, e.g., the NPTL (Linux) pthread rwlock implementation which use either a reader or writer preferred strategy. The reader/writer preferred strategy is problematic since it starves threads doing the non-preferred operation.</p> <p> The new rwlock implementations in general performs better in ERTS than common pthread implementations. However, in some extremely heavily contended cases this is not the case. Such heavy contention can more or less only appear on ETS tables. This when multiple processes do very large amounts of write locked operations simultaneously on the same table. Such use of ETS is bad regardless of rwlock implementation, will never scale, and is something we strongly advise against.</p> <p> The new rwlock implementations depend on atomic operations. If no native atomic implementation is found, a fallback solution will be used. Using the fallback implies a performance degradation. That is, it is more important now than before to build OTP with a native atomic implementation.</p> <p> The <code>ethread</code> library contains native atomic implementations for, x86 (32 and 64 bit), powerpc (32 bit), sparc V9 (32 and 64 bit), and tilera (32 bit). On other hardware gcc's builtin support for atomic memory access will be used if such exists. If no such support is found, <code>configure</code> will warn about no atomic implementation available.</p> <p> The <code>ethread</code> library can now also use the <code>libatomic_ops</code> library for atomic memory accesses. This makes it possible for the Erlang runtime system to utilize optimized native atomic operations on more platforms than before. If <code>configure</code> warns about no atomic implementation available, try using the <code>libatomic_ops</code> library. Use the <code>--with-libatomic_ops=PATH</code> <code>configure</code> command line argument when specifying where the <code>libatomic_ops</code> installation is located. The <code>libatomic_ops</code> library can be downloaded from: <code><a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/">http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/</a></code></p> <p> The changed API of the <code>ethread</code> library has also caused modifications in the Erlang runtime system. Preparations for the to come "delayed deallocation" feature has also been done since it depends on the <code>ethread</code> library.</p> <p> <strong>Note</strong>: When building for x86, the <code>ethread</code> library will now use instructions that first appeared on the pentium 4 processor. If you want the runtime system to be compatible with older processors (back to 486) you need to pass the <code>--enable-ethread-pre-pentium4-compatibility</code> <code>configure</code> command line argument when configuring the system.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-8544</p> </li> <li> <p> erlang:localtime_to_universaltime({{2008, 8, 1}, {0, 0, 0}},true) when TZ=UTC now behaves consistently on all Unix platforms.</p> <p> The problem fixed was originally reported by Paul Guyot on erlang-bugs mailing list:</p> <p> http://www.erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-bugs/2008-November/001077.html</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-8580</p> </li> <li> <p> Optimization reducing memory consumption by two words per ETS object.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-8737</p> </li> <li> <p> Fixes for unsupported halfword-emulator</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-8745</p> </li> <li> <p> NIF 64-bit integer support; <code>enif_get_int64</code>, <code>enif_get_uint64</code>, <code>enif_make_int64</code>, <code>enif_make_uint64</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-8746</p> </li> <li> <p> Alignment of trailing data in messages has been adjusted.

Previously distribution port locks were heavily contended, and all encoding and decoding for a specific distribution channel had to be done in sequence. Lock contention due to the distribution is now negligible and both encoding and decoding of Erlang messages can be done in parallel.</p> <p> The old atom cache protocol used by the Erlang distribution has been dropped since it effectively prevented all parallel encoding and decoding of messages passed over the same distribution channel.</p> <p> A new atom cache protocol has been introduced which isolates atom cache accesses and makes parallel encoding and decoding of messages passed over the same distribution channel possible. The new atom cache protocol also use an atom cache size 8 times larger than before. The new atom cache protocol is documented in the ERTS users guide.</p> <p> Erlang messages received via the distribution are now decoded by the receiving Erlang processes without holding any distribution channel specific locks. Erlang messages and signals sent over the distribution are as before encoded by the sending Erlang process, but now without holding any distribution channel specific locks during the encoding. That is, both encoding and decoding can be and are done in parallel regardless of distribution channel used.</p> <p> The part that cannot be parallelized is the atom cache updates. Atom cache updates are therefore now scheduled on the distribution port. Since it is only one entity per distribution channel doing this work there is no lock contention due to the atom cache updates.</p> <p> The new runtime system does not understand the old atom cache protocol. New and old runtime systems can however still communicate, but no atom cache will be used.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-7774</p> </li> <li> <p> Fixed a bug that caused error logging from <code>driver_select</code> sometimes with additional symptoms such as failing IP communications or even an emulator crash.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-7898 Aux Id: seq11304 </p> </li> <li> <p> Improved SMP concurrency for ETS tables. Several mutating operations can now be performed truly concurrent on different records of the same table. To support this, the table has to be created with option <code>write_concurrency</code>, as it is achieved at the expense of some execution and memory overhead. <code>ets:select</code> and <code>select_count</code> has also been improved for all tables to not acquire exclusive table lock during the iteration.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-7922</p> </li> <li> <p> erl (that is erl.exe and dyn_erl) and erlexec has been made more dynamic so no hard coded paths needs to added at installation time to erl (that is erl.ini and erl). Reltool will make use of this in a future release.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-7952</p> </li> <li> <p> Added functionality to get higher resolution timestamp from system. The erlang:now function returns a timestamp that's not always consistent with the actual operating system time (due to resilience against large time changes in the operating system). The function os:timestamp/0 is added to get a similar timestamp as the one being returned by erlang:now, but untouched by Erlangs time correcting and smoothing algorithms. The timestamp returned by os:timestamp is always consistent with the operating systems view of time, like the calendar functions for getting wall clock time, but with higher resolution. Example of usage can be found in the os manual page.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-7971</p> </li> <li> <p> Two new options are added to open_port - spawn_executable which runs external executables in a controlled way, and spawn_driver which only opens port to loaded Erlang drivers.

The reduced amount of migration also reduce lock contention on locks protecting the scheduler specific instances of the erts internal memory allocators.</p> <p> The scheduler specific run queues are also a necessity for a lot of future planned NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) specific optimizations.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-7500</p> </li> <li> <p>Support for Unicode is implemented as described in EEP10. Formatting and reading of unicode data both from terminals and files is supported by the io and io_lib modules. Files can be opened in modes with automatic translation to and from different unicode formats. The module 'unicode' contains functions for conversion between external and internal unicode formats and the re module has support for unicode data. There is also language syntax for specifying string and character data beyond the ISO-latin-1 range.</p> <p>The interactive shell will support input and output of unicode characters when the terminal and operating system supports it.</p> <p>Please see the EEP and the io/io_lib manual pages as well as the stdlib users guide for details.</p> <p><strong>I/O-protocol incompatibilities:</strong></p> <p>The io_protocol between io_Server and client is updated to handle protocol data in unicode formats. The updated protocol is now documented. The specification resides in the stdlib <strong>users manual</strong>, which is a new part of the manual.</p> <p><strong>io module incompatibilities:</strong></p> <p>The io:put_chars, io:get_chars and io:get_line all handle and return unicode data. In the case where binaries can be provided (as to io:put_chars), they shall be encoded in UTF-8. When binaries are returned (as by io:get_line/get_chars when the io_server is set in <strong>binary mode</strong>) the returned data is also <strong>always</strong> encoded as UTF-8. The file module however still returns byte-oriented data, why file:read can be used instead of io:get_chars to read binary data in ISO-latin-1.</p> <p><strong>io_lib module incompatibilities:</strong></p> <p>io_lib:format can, given new format directives (i.e "~ts" and "~tc"), return lists containing integers larger than 255. </p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-7648 Aux Id: OTP-7580 OTP-7514 OTP-7494 OTP-7443 OTP-7181 EEP10 EEP11 </p> </li> <li> <p> The format of the string returned by <code>erlang:system_info(system_version)</code> (as well as the first message when Erlang is started) has changed.

As a result <code>erlang:memory/[0,1]</code> will only deliver a result if all <code>erts_alloc(3)</code> allocators are enabled (default). The result delivered when all <code>erts_alloc(3)</code> allocators are enabled are both more accurate and less accurate than before. More memory than before are included in the result, but the different parts that are summed are not gathered atomically. A call to <code>erlang:memory/[0,1]</code> is much cheaper for the system than before. This since the information isn't gathered atomically anymore which was very expensive.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-7468</p> </li> <li> <p> Pre-allocators used for, for example, timers, and messages have been rewritten to be scheduler specific.

Therefore, the implications of this change is described in the Efficiency Guide.</p> <p>Example 1: In the expression <code>element(BitNum-1, {1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128})</code>, the tuple used to be constructed every time the expression was executed, which could be detrimental to performance in two ways if the expression was executed in a loop: the time to build the tuple itself and the time spent in garbage collections because the heap filled up with garbage faster.</p> <p>Example 2: Literal strings, such as <code>"abc"</code>, used to be stored in the compiled code compactly as a byte string and expanded to a list at run-time. Now all strings will be stored expanded to lists (such as <code>[$a,$b,$c]</code>) in the constant pool. That means that the string will be faster to use at run-time, but that it will require more space even when not used. If space is an issue, you might want to use binary literals (that is, <code>&lt;&lt;"abc"&gt;&gt;</code>) instead of string literals for infrequently used long strings (such as error messages).</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-6850</p> </li> <li> <p>The Erlang driver API has been extended with a portable POSIX thread like API for multi-threading.

The emulator can, however, not make sure that a driver that doesn't use the extended driver interface isn't incompatible. Therefore, when loading a driver that doesn't use the extended driver interface, there is a risk that it will be loaded also when the driver is incompatible.

Port locking is either done on driver level, i.e., all ports executing the same driver share a lock, or on port level, i.e., each port has its own lock. Currently the inet driver, the efile driver, and the spawn driver use port level locking and all other statically linked in drivers use driver level locking. By default dynamically linked in drivers will use locking on driver level. For more information on how to enable port level locking see the <code>erl_driver(3)</code> and the <code>driver_entry(3)</code> man pages. </p> <p>As of erts version 5.5.3 the driver interface has been extended. The extended interface introduce version management, the possibility to pass capability flags to the runtime system at driver initialization, and some new driver API functions. For example, the <code>driver_system_info()</code> function which can be used to determine if the driver is run in a runtime system with SMP support or not. The extended interface doesn't have to be used, <strong>but</strong> dynamically linked in driver <strong>have</strong> to be recompiled.

This is mainly useful for compiling native code, because native code must be compiled with same type of run-time system as in which it will be run.</p> <p>If the <code>-s</code> option is given, <code>erlc</code> now prints a warning that it is deprecated and that it will be removed in R12B.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6398</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>schedulers</code> option of <code>erlang:system_flag/2</code> has been removed, i.e., the number of scheduler threads cannot be changed after emulator boot time any more.</p> <p>A <code>multi_scheduling</code> option has been added to <code>erlang:system_flag/2</code>. This option can be used for blocking and unblocking multi-scheduling. For more information see the <code>erlang(3)</code> documentation.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6403</p> </li> <li> <p>A port program that had been started with the <code>exit_status</code> option and closed one of the pipes used for communication with the emulator caused the emulator to continuously poll for termination of the port program. This only became a problem when the emulator didn't have other things to do and the port program closed a pipe much earlier than it terminated. When the emulator had other things to do, such as running Erlang processes, the emulator polled for termination in between scheduling of processes.</p> <p>Now the emulator doesn't poll for termination of the port program at all; instead, it waits for the child signal from the terminated port program to arrive and then schedules the Erlang port for termination.</p> <p>The termination of any port programs have also been optimized. Previously the termination of any port program did always cause a scan of a table of the size equal to maximum number of file descriptors. If the maximum number of file descriptors was large, this scan could be quite expensive. Now the search have been reduced to the set of ports started with the <code>exit_status</code> option.</p> <p>Note, all of the above only applies to Erlang emulators on Unix platforms.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6412 Aux Id: seq10194 </p> </li> <li> <p>* BEAM: added support for floating-point exceptions on FreeBSD (32-bit x86)</p> <p>* SMP: made locking procedures work even when native lock operations aren't implemented</p> <p>* SMP: improved timing accuracy in the timer thread (if enabled)</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-6424</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="erts-5.5.2.2" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">1.311 Erts 5.5.2.2</div>  </h2> <h3 id="fixed-bugs-and-malfunctions" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</div>  </h3> <ul> <li> <p>A bug in the kernel poll implementation could cause the emulator to omit polling for events on file descriptors.

The released system is however truly multi threaded and you will notice increased performance for many applications already. We recommend that you evaluate your application on the SMP version of the runtime system and wait for some more optimizations before you use it in a real product. You will then discover if there are any problems in your application that needs to be fixed in order for it to work properly in a multi threaded environment. More optimized versions of the runtime system with SMP support will be included in the R11B maintenance releases.</p> <p>The SMP enabled runtime system will be started if the <code>-smp</code> command line argument is passed to the <code>erl</code> command. In order to make use of more than one processor core, multiple scheduler threads are used. By default, the number of scheduler threads will equal the number of processor cores. The number of scheduler threads can be set with the <code>+S</code> command line argument. For more information see the <code>erl(1)</code> man page.</p> <p>A runtime system with SMP support is by default built on the following platforms if posix threads, and a gcc compiler of at least version 2.95 is found:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Linux with at least kernel version 2.6 and the Native POSIX Thread Library on x86, x86_64, and 32-bits PowerPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Solaris of at least version 8 on 32-bits SPARC-V9.</p> </li> <li> <p>MacOSX of at least version 10.4 (Darwin 8.0) on 32-bits PowerPC.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The runtime system with SMP support is known <strong>not</strong> to build on:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Windows.</p> </li> <li> <p>Linux with kernel versions less than 2.4, or without the Native POSIX Thread Library.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other hardware platforms than x86, x86_64, 32-bits SPARC-V9 and 32-bits PowerPC.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Windows will be supported in a future release.</p> <p>The runtime system with SMP support might build on other operating systems in combination with supported hardware. In order to force a build of a runtime system with SMP support, pass the <code>--enable-smp-support</code> command line argument to configure. Note, however, that it is not enough that it builds. The underlying thread library and operating system has to provide SMP support as well. If the thread library does not distribute scheduler threads over multiple processor cores then the runtime system will only seemingly provide SMP support. If the runtime system is not built by default on a specific platform, we have <strong>not</strong> tested it on that platform.</p> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The design of SMP support for drivers is ongoing. There will probably be incompatible driver changes (only affecting drivers run on the runtime system with SMP support) released as patches for R11B.</p> <p><strong>Potential incompatibility</strong>: Previously, specific driver call-backs were always called from the same thread. This is <strong>not</strong> true in the runtime system with SMP support. Calls to call-backs will be made from different threads, e.g., two consecutive calls to exactly the same call-back can be made from two different threads. This will in <strong>most</strong> cases not be a problem. All calls to call-backs are synchronized, i.e., only one call-back will be called at a time.</p> <p>In the future the default behavior will <strong>probably</strong> be the following: Calls to call-backs will, as now, be made from different threads. Calls to call-backs in the same driver <strong>instance</strong> will be synchronized. It will probably be possible to configure so that all calls to call-backs in all driver instances of a specific driver type will be synchronized. It may be possible to configure so that all calls to call-backs of a driver instance or a of a specific driver type will be made from the same thread.</p> <p>Parallelism in the Erlang code executed is a necessity for the Erlang runtime system to be able to take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor hardware. There need to be at least as many Erlang processes runnable as processor cores for the Erlang runtime system to be able to take advantage of all processor cores.</p> <p>An Erlang runtime system with SMP support with only one Erlang process runnable all the time will almost always be slower than the same Erlang runtime system without SMP support. This is due to thread synchronization overhead.</p> <p>Known major bottleneck in the Erlang runtime system:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Currently the I/O system uses one "big lock", i.e. only one thread can do I/O at a time (with the exception of async threads and threads created by users own linked-in drivers). This is high on the list of things to optimize. Note, code that does not do I/O can be executed at the same time as one thread does I/O.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Some pitfalls which might cause Erlang programs that work on the non-SMP runtime system to fail on the SMP runtime system:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A newly spawned process will often begin executing immediately. Code that expects that the parent process will be able to execute for a while before the child process begins executing is likely to fail.</p> </li> <li> <p>High priority processes could previously provide mutual exclusion (bad programming style) by preventing normal and low priority processes from being run. High priority processes cannot be used this way to provide mutual exclusion.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>erlang:yield()</code> could be used to provide some kind of temporary mutual exclusion (also bad programming style). <code>erlang:yield()</code> cannot be used to provide any kind of mutual exclusion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Obscure pitfall, only if a process being traced also sends normal messages to the tracer:<br> The order between trace messages and normal messages is undefined. I.e. the order between normal messages sent from a tracee to a tracer and the trace messages generated from the same tracee to the same tracer is undefined. The internal order of normal messages and the internal order of trace messages will, of course, be preserved as before.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The kernel poll feature is currently not supported by the runtime system with SMP support.
