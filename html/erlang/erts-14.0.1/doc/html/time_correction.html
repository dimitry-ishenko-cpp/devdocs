As Erlang is a language with soft real-time properties and we can express time in our programs, the Virtual Machine and the language must be careful about what is considered a correct time and in how time functions behave.</p> <p>When Erlang was designed, it was assumed that the wall clock time in the system showed a monotonic time moving forward at exactly the same pace as the definition of time. This more or less meant that an atomic clock (or better time source) was expected to be attached to your hardware and that the hardware was then expected to be locked away from any human tinkering forever. While this can be a compelling thought, it is simply never the case.</p> <p>A "normal" modern computer cannot keep time, not on itself and not unless you have a chip-level atomic clock wired to it. Time, as perceived by your computer, must normally be corrected. Hence the Network Time Protocol (NTP) protocol, together with the <code>ntpd</code> process, does its best to keep your computer time in sync with the correct time. Between NTP corrections, usually a less potent time-keeper than an atomic clock is used.</p> <p>However, NTP is not fail-safe. The NTP server can be unavailable, <code>ntp.conf</code> can be wrongly configured, or your computer can sometimes be disconnected from Internet. Furthermore, you can have a user (or even system administrator) who thinks the correct way to handle Daylight Saving Time is to adjust the clock one hour two times a year (which is the incorrect way to do it). To complicate things further, this user fetched your software from Internet and has not considered what the correct time is as perceived by a computer. The user does not care about keeping the wall clock in sync with the correct time. The user expects your program to have unlimited knowledge about the time.</p> <p>Most programmers also expect time to be reliable, at least until they realize that the wall clock time on their workstation is off by a minute. Then they set it to the correct time, but most probably not in a smooth way.</p> <p>The number of problems that arise when you always expect the wall clock time on the system to be correct can be immense. Erlang therefore introduced the "corrected estimate of time", or the "time correction", many years ago. The time correction relies on the fact that most operating systems have some kind of monotonic clock, either a real-time extension or some built-in "tick counter" that is independent of the wall clock settings. This counter can have microsecond resolution or much less, but it has a drift that cannot be ignored.</p> <h2 id="time-correction" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">3.4 Time Correction</div>  </h2> <p>If time correction is enabled, the Erlang runtime system makes use of both <code><a href="#OS_System_Time">OS system time</a></code> and <code><a href="#OS_Monotonic_Time">OS monotonic time</a></code>, to adjust the frequency of the Erlang monotonic clock. Time correction ensures that <code><a href="#Erlang_Monotonic_Time">Erlang monotonic time</a></code> does not warp and that the frequency is relatively accurate. The type of frequency adjustments depends on the time warp mode used. Section <code><a href="#Time_Warp_Modes">Time Warp Modes</a></code> provides more details.</p> <p>By default time correction is enabled if support for it exists on the specific platform. Support for it includes both OS monotonic time, provided by the OS, and an implementation in the Erlang runtime system using OS monotonic time. To check if your system has support for OS monotonic time, call <code><a href="erlang.html#system_info_os_monotonic_time_source"> erlang:system_info(os_monotonic_time_source)</a></code>. To check if time correction is enabled on your system, call <code><a href="erlang.html#system_info_time_correction"> erlang:system_info(time_correction)</a></code>.</p> <p>To enable or disable time correction, pass command-line argument <code><a href="erl.html#+c">+c [true|false]</a></code> to <code><a href="erl.html">erl(1)</a></code>.</p> <p>If time correction is disabled, Erlang monotonic time can warp forwards or stop, or even freeze for extended periods of time. There are then no guarantees that the frequency of the Erlang monotonic clock is accurate or stable.</p> <p><strong>You typically never want to disable time correction</strong>. Previously a performance penalty was associated with time correction, but nowadays it is usually the other way around. If time correction is disabled, you probably get bad scalability, bad performance, and bad time measurements.</p> <h2 id="time-warp-safe-code" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">3.5 Time Warp Safe Code</div>  </h2> <p>Time warp safe code can handle a <code><a href="#Time_Warp">time warp</a></code> of <code><a href="#Erlang_System_Time">Erlang system time</a></code>.</p> <p><code><a href="erlang.html#now-0">erlang:now/0</a></code> behaves bad when Erlang system time warps. When Erlang system time does a time warp backwards, the values returned from <code>erlang:now/0</code> freeze (if you disregard the microsecond increments made because of the actual call) until OS system time reaches the point of the last value returned by <code>erlang:now/0</code>. This freeze can continue for a long time. It can take years, decades, and even longer until the freeze stops.</p> <p>All uses of <code>erlang:now/0</code> are not necessarily time warp unsafe. If you do not use it to get time, it is time warp safe. However, <strong>all uses of <code>erlang:now/0</code> are suboptimal</strong> from a performance and scalability perspective.

A significant downside of this approach is that we on purpose will use a faulty frequency on the Erlang monotonic clock if adjustments are needed. This error can be as large as 1%. This error will show up in all time measurements in the runtime system.</p> <p>If time correction is not enabled, Erlang monotonic time freezes when OS system time leaps backwards.

It is introduced to detach time measurements, such as elapsed time from calendar time. In many use cases there is a need to measure elapsed time or specify a time relative to another point in time without the need to know the involved times in UTC or any other globally defined time scale. By introducing a time scale with a local definition of where it starts, time that do not concern calendar time can be managed on that time scale. Erlang monotonic time uses such a time scale with a locally defined start.</p> <p>The introduction of Erlang monotonic time allows us to adjust the two Erlang times (Erlang monotonic time and Erlang system time) separately. By doing this, the accuracy of elapsed time does not have to suffer just because the system time happened to be wrong at some point in time. Separate adjustments of the two times are only performed in the time warp modes, and only fully separated in the <code><a href="#Multi_Time_Warp_Mode">multi-time warp mode</a></code>. All other modes than the multi-time warp mode are for backward compatibility reasons. When using these modes, the accuracy of Erlang monotonic time suffer, as the adjustments of Erlang monotonic time in these modes are more or less tied to Erlang system time.</p> <p>The adjustment of system time could have been made smother than using a time warp approach, but we think that would be a bad choice. As we can express and measure time that is not connected to calendar time by the use of Erlang monotonic time, it is better to expose the change in Erlang system time immediately. This as the Erlang applications executing on the system can react on the change in system time as soon as possible. This is also more or less exactly how most operating systems handle this (OS monotonic time and OS system time). By adjusting system time smoothly, we would just hide the fact that system time changed and make it harder for the Erlang applications to react to the change in a sensible way.</p> <p>To be able to react to a change in Erlang system time, you must be able to detect that it happened. The change in Erlang system time occurs when the current time offset is changed. We have therefore introduced the possibility to monitor the time offset using <code><a href="erlang.html#monitor-2"> erlang:monitor(time_offset, clock_service)</a></code>. A process monitoring the time offset is sent a message on the following format when the time offset is changed:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{'CHANGE', MonitorReference, time_offset, clock_service, NewTimeOffset}</pre>  <h3 id="unique-values" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Unique Values</div>  </h3> <p>Besides reporting time, <code>erlang:now/0</code> also produces unique and strictly monotonically increasing values.

If so, you cannot use the new API out of the box, as it will not be available on releases before OTP 18. The solution is <strong>not</strong> to avoid using the new API, as your code would then not benefit from the scalability and accuracy improvements made. Instead, use the new API when available, and fall back on <code>erlang:now/0</code> when the new API is unavailable.</p> <p>Fortunately most of the new API can easily be implemented using existing primitives, except for:</p> <ul> <li> <code><a href="erlang.html#system_info_start_time"> erlang:system_info(start_time)</a></code> </li> <li> <code><a href="erlang.html#system_info_end_time"> erlang:system_info(end_time)</a></code> </li> <li> <code><a href="erlang.html#system_info_os_monotonic_time_source"> erlang:system_info(os_monotonic_time_source)</a></code> </li> <li> <code><a href="erlang.html#system_info_os_system_time_source"> erlang:system_info(os_system_time_source)</a></code> </li> </ul> <p>By wrapping the API with functions that fall back on <code>erlang:now/0</code> when the new API is unavailable, and using these wrappers instead of using the API directly, the problem is solved. These wrappers can, for example, be implemented as in <code><span>$ERL_TOP/erts/example/time_compat.erl</span></code>.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
