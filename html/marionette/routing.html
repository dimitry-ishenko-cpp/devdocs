Routing in Marionette</h1>
<p>Users of versions of Marionette prior to v4 will notice that a router is no longer a <a href="classes.html">bundled class</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette.approuter">Marionette.AppRouter</a> was extracted and the core library will no longer hold an opinion on routing.</p> <h2 id="some-routing-solutions">
Some Routing Solutions</h2>
<p>Besides the router <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Router">bundled with Backbone</a> there are many viable routing solutions available. Some specifically designed for Backbone or Marionette and some that are generic solutions for any framework. Here are a few of those options.</p> <h2 id="marionette-community-routers">
Marionette Community Routers</h2>
<h3 id="marionetteapprouter-httpsgithubcommarionettejsmarionetteapprouter">
<a href="https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette.approuter">Marionette.AppRouter</a>
</h3>
<p>Previously bundled router. Extends <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Router">backbone.router</a> and is helpful for breaking a large amount of routes on a single backbone.router instance into smaller more managable approuters.</p> <h3 id="marionetterouting-httpsgithubcomblikblummarionetterouting">
<a href="https://github.com/blikblum/marionette.routing">Marionette.Routing</a>
</h3>
<p>An advanced router for MarionetteJS applications. Includes nested routes, states, rendering, async operations, lazy loading routes, Radio channel eventing, and inherits most of CherryTree features while maintaining a similar to Marionette API.</p> <h3 id="backboneeventrouter-httpsgithubcomroundingwellosbackboneeventrouter">
<a href="https://github.com/RoundingWellOS/backbone.eventrouter">Backbone.Eventrouter</a>
</h3>
<p>A highly opinionated, simplistic Backbone.Router coupled with a Backbone.Radio.Channel. When an event is triggered on the channel, it will set the route URL, or when a URL matches a route it will throw an event on the channel.</p> <h2 id="generic-routers">
Generic Routers</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leeluolee/stateman">Stateman</a> Angular-UI style routing, without the Angular</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/QubitProducts/cherrytree">Cherrytree</a> Nested routes, like Ember, but without the transition lifecycle.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/tildeio/router.js">router.js</a> This is what Ember's router is built on top of. It has all of the features needed for good routing</p> <h2 id="know-of-other-routers-that-should-be-listed-here">
