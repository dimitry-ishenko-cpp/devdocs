<h1 class="section">Introduction to Line Editing</h1> <p>The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent keystrokes. </p> <p>The text <kbd>C-k</kbd> is read as ‘Control-K’ and describes the character produced when the <code>k</code> key is pressed while the Control key is depressed. </p> <p>The text <kbd>M-k</kbd> is read as ‘Meta-K’ and describes the character produced when the Meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the <code>k</code> key is pressed. The Meta key is labeled <code>ALT</code> on many keyboards. On keyboards with two keys labeled <code>ALT</code> (usually to either side of the space bar), the <code>ALT</code> on the left side is generally set to work as a Meta key. The <code>ALT</code> key on the right may also be configured to work as a Meta key or may be configured as some other modifier, such as a Compose key for typing accented characters. </p> <p>If you do not have a Meta or <code>ALT</code> key, or another key working as a Meta key, the identical keystroke can be generated by typing <code>ESC</code> <em>first</em>, and then typing <code>k</code>. Either process is known as <em>metafying</em> the <code>k</code> key. </p> <p>The text <kbd>M-C-k</kbd> is read as ‘Meta-Control-k’ and describes the character produced by <em>metafying</em> <kbd>C-k</kbd>. </p> <p>In addition, several keys have their own names. Specifically, <code>DEL</code>, <code>ESC</code>, <code>LFD</code>, <code>SPC</code>, <code>RET</code>, and <code>TAB</code> all stand for themselves when seen in this text, or in an init file (see <a href="readline-init-file.html">Readline Init File</a>). If your keyboard lacks a <code>LFD</code> key, typing <code>C-j</code> will produce the desired character. The <code>RET</code> key may be labeled <code>Return</code> or <code>Enter</code> on some keyboards. </p><div class="_attribution">
