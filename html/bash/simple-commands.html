<h1 class="subsection">Simple Commands</h1>  <p>A simple command is the kind of command encountered most often. It’s just a sequence of words separated by <code>blank</code>s, terminated by one of the shell’s control operators (see <a href="definitions.html">Definitions</a>). The first word generally specifies a command to be executed, with the rest of the words being that command’s arguments. </p> <p>The return status (see <a href="exit-status.html">Exit Status</a>) of a simple command is its exit status as provided by the <small>POSIX</small> 1003.1 <code>waitpid</code> function, or 128+<var>n</var> if the command was terminated by signal <var>n</var>. </p><div class="_attribution">
