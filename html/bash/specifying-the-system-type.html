<h1 class="section">Specifying the System Type</h1> <p>There may be some features <code>configure</code> can not figure out automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host Bash will run on. Usually <code>configure</code> can figure that out, but if it prints a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the <samp>--host=TYPE</samp> option. ‘<samp>TYPE</samp>’ can either be a short name for the system type, such as ‘<samp>sun4</samp>’, or a canonical name with three fields: ‘<samp>CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM</samp>’ (e.g., ‘<samp>i386-unknown-freebsd4.2</samp>’). </p> <p>See the file <samp>support/config.sub</samp> for the possible values of each field. </p><div class="_attribution">
