<h1 class="subsection">What is an Interactive Shell?</h1> <p>An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments (unless <samp>-s</samp> is specified) and without specifying the <samp>-c</samp> option, whose input and error output are both connected to terminals (as determined by <code>isatty(3)</code>), or one started with the <samp>-i</samp> option. </p> <p>An interactive shell generally reads from and writes to a userâ€™s terminal. </p> <p>The <samp>-s</samp> invocation option may be used to set the positional parameters when an interactive shell is started. </p><div class="_attribution">
