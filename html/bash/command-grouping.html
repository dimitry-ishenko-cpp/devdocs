<h1 class="subsubsection">Grouping Commands</h1>  <p>Bash provides two ways to group a list of commands to be executed as a unit. When commands are grouped, redirections may be applied to the entire command list. For example, the output of all the commands in the list may be redirected to a single stream. </p> <dl compact> <dt><span><code>()</code></span></dt> <dd>
<div class="example"> <pre class="example">( list )
</pre>
</div> <p>Placing a list of commands between parentheses forces the shell to create a subshell (see <a href="command-execution-environment.html">Command Execution Environment</a>), and each of the commands in <var>list</var> is executed in that subshell environment. Since the <var>list</var> is executed in a subshell, variable assignments do not remain in effect after the subshell completes. </p> </dd> <dt id="index-_007b"><span><code>{}</code></span></dt> <dd>
 <div class="example"> <pre class="example">{ list; }
</pre>
</div> <p>Placing a list of commands between curly braces causes the list to be executed in the current shell context. No subshell is created. The semicolon (or newline) following <var>list</var> is required. </p>
</dd> </dl> <p>In addition to the creation of a subshell, there is a subtle difference between these two constructs due to historical reasons. The braces are reserved words, so they must be separated from the <var>list</var> by <code>blank</code>s or other shell metacharacters. The parentheses are operators, and are recognized as separate tokens by the shell even if they are not separated from the <var>list</var> by whitespace. </p> <p>The exit status of both of these constructs is the exit status of <var>list</var>. </p><div class="_attribution">
