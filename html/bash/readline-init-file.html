<h1 class="section">Readline Init File</h1>  <p>Although the Readline library comes with a set of Emacs-like keybindings installed by default, it is possible to use a different set of keybindings. Any user can customize programs that use Readline by putting commands in an <em>inputrc</em> file, conventionally in their home directory. The name of this file is taken from the value of the shell variable <code>INPUTRC</code>. If that variable is unset, the default is <samp>~/.inputrc</samp>. If that file does not exist or cannot be read, the ultimate default is <samp>/etc/inputrc</samp>. The <code>bind</code> builtin command can also be used to set Readline keybindings and variables. See <a href="bash-builtins.html">Bash Builtin Commands</a>. </p> <p>When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the init file is read, and the key bindings are set. </p> <p>In addition, the <code>C-x C-r</code> command re-reads this init file, thus incorporating any changes that you might have made to it. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="readline-init-file-syntax.html" accesskey="1">Readline Init File Syntax</a></li> <li><a href="conditional-init-constructs.html" accesskey="2">Conditional Init Constructs</a></li> <li><a href="sample-init-file.html" accesskey="3">Sample Init File</a></li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
