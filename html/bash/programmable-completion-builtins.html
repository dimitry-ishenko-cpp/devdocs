<h1 class="section">Programmable Completion Builtins</h1>  <p>Three builtin commands are available to manipulate the programmable completion facilities: one to specify how the arguments to a particular command are to be completed, and two to modify the completion as it is happening. </p> <dl compact> <dt id="index-compgen"><span><code>compgen</code></span></dt> <dd>
<div class="example"> <pre class="example">compgen [option] [word]
</pre>
</div> <p>Generate possible completion matches for <var>word</var> according to the <var>option</var>s, which may be any option accepted by the <code>complete</code> builtin with the exception of <samp>-p</samp> and <samp>-r</samp>, and write the matches to the standard output. When using the <samp>-F</samp> or <samp>-C</samp> options, the various shell variables set by the programmable completion facilities, while available, will not have useful values. </p> <p>The matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable completion code had generated them directly from a completion specification with the same flags. If <var>word</var> is specified, only those completions matching <var>word</var> will be displayed. </p> <p>The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or no matches were generated. </p> </dd> <dt id="index-complete"><span><code>complete</code></span></dt> <dd>
<div class="example"> <pre class="example">complete [-abcdefgjksuv] [-o comp-option] [-DEI] [-A action] [-G globpat]
[-W wordlist] [-F function] [-C command] [-X filterpat]
[-P prefix] [-S suffix] name [name …]
complete -pr [-DEI] [name …]
</pre>
</div> <p>Specify how arguments to each <var>name</var> should be completed. If the <samp>-p</samp> option is supplied, or if no options are supplied, existing completion specifications are printed in a way that allows them to be reused as input. The <samp>-r</samp> option removes a completion specification for each <var>name</var>, or, if no <var>name</var>s are supplied, all completion specifications. The <samp>-D</samp> option indicates that other supplied options and actions should apply to the “default” command completion; that is, completion attempted on a command for which no completion has previously been defined. The <samp>-E</samp> option indicates that other supplied options and actions should apply to “empty” command completion; that is, completion attempted on a blank line. The <samp>-I</samp> option indicates that other supplied options and actions should apply to completion on the initial non-assignment word on the line, or after a command delimiter such as ‘<samp>;</samp>’ or ‘<samp>|</samp>’, which is usually command name completion. If multiple options are supplied, the <samp>-D</samp> option takes precedence over <samp>-E</samp>, and both take precedence over <samp>-I</samp>. If any of <samp>-D</samp>, <samp>-E</samp>, or <samp>-I</samp> are supplied, any other <var>name</var> arguments are ignored; these completions only apply to the case specified by the option. </p> <p>The process of applying these completion specifications when word completion is attempted is described above (see <a href="programmable-completion.html">Programmable Completion</a>). </p> <p>Other options, if specified, have the following meanings. The arguments to the <samp>-G</samp>, <samp>-W</samp>, and <samp>-X</samp> options (and, if necessary, the <samp>-P</samp> and <samp>-S</samp> options) should be quoted to protect them from expansion before the <code>complete</code> builtin is invoked. </p> <dl compact> <dt><span><code>-o <var>comp-option</var></code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>The <var>comp-option</var> controls several aspects of the compspec’s behavior beyond the simple generation of completions. <var>comp-option</var> may be one of: </p> <dl compact> <dt><span><code>bashdefault</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Perform the rest of the default Bash completions if the compspec generates no matches. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>default</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Use Readline’s default filename completion if the compspec generates no matches. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>dirnames</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Perform directory name completion if the compspec generates no matches. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>filenames</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Tell Readline that the compspec generates filenames, so it can perform any filename-specific processing (like adding a slash to directory names, quoting special characters, or suppressing trailing spaces). This option is intended to be used with shell functions specified with <samp>-F</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>noquote</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Tell Readline not to quote the completed words if they are filenames (quoting filenames is the default). </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>nosort</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Tell Readline not to sort the list of possible completions alphabetically. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>nospace</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Tell Readline not to append a space (the default) to words completed at the end of the line. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>plusdirs</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>After any matches defined by the compspec are generated, directory name completion is attempted and any matches are added to the results of the other actions. </p> </dd> </dl> </dd> <dt><span><code>-A <var>action</var></code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>The <var>action</var> may be one of the following to generate a list of possible completions: </p> <dl compact> <dt><span><code>alias</code></span></dt> <dd>

<p>The shell function <var>function</var> is executed in the current shell environment.
