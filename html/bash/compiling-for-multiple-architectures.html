<h1 class="section">Compiling For Multiple Architectures</h1> <p>You can compile Bash for more than one kind of computer at the same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their own directory. To do this, you must use a version of <code>make</code> that supports the <code>VPATH</code> variable, such as GNU <code>make</code>. <code>cd</code> to the directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run the <code>configure</code> script from the source directory (see <a href="basic-installation.html">Basic Installation</a>). You may need to supply the <samp>--srcdir=PATH</samp> argument to tell <code>configure</code> where the source files are. <code>configure</code> automatically checks for the source code in the directory that <code>configure</code> is in and in ‘..’. </p> <p>If you have to use a <code>make</code> that does not support the <code>VPATH</code> variable, you can compile Bash for one architecture at a time in the source code directory. After you have installed Bash for one architecture, use ‘<samp>make distclean</samp>’ before reconfiguring for another architecture. </p> <p>Alternatively, if your system supports symbolic links, you can use the <samp>support/mkclone</samp> script to create a build tree which has symbolic links back to each file in the source directory. Here’s an example that creates a build directory in the current directory from a source directory <samp>/usr/gnu/src/bash-2.0</samp>: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">bash /usr/gnu/src/bash-2.0/support/mkclone -s /usr/gnu/src/bash-2.0 .
</pre>
</div> <p>The <code>mkclone</code> script requires Bash, so you must have already built Bash for at least one architecture before you can create build directories for other architectures. </p><div class="_attribution">
