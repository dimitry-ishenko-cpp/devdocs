<h1 class="subsection">Compound Commands</h1>  <p>Compound commands are the shell programming language constructs. Each construct begins with a reserved word or control operator and is terminated by a corresponding reserved word or operator. Any redirections (see <a href="redirections.html">Redirections</a>) associated with a compound command apply to all commands within that compound command unless explicitly overridden. </p> <p>In most cases a list of commands in a compound commandâ€™s description may be separated from the rest of the command by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place of a semicolon. </p> <p>Bash provides looping constructs, conditional commands, and mechanisms to group commands and execute them as a unit. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="looping-constructs.html" accesskey="1">Looping Constructs</a></li> <li><a href="conditional-constructs.html" accesskey="2">Conditional Constructs</a></li> <li><a href="command-grouping.html" accesskey="3">Grouping Commands</a></li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
