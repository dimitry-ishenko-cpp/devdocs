<h1 class="subsubsection">Double Quotes</h1> <p>Enclosing characters in double quotes (‘<samp>"</samp>’) preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of ‘<samp>$</samp>’, ‘<samp>`</samp>’, ‘<samp>\</samp>’, and, when history expansion is enabled, ‘<samp>!</samp>’. When the shell is in <small>POSIX</small> mode (see <a href="bash-posix-mode.html">Bash POSIX Mode</a>), the ‘<samp>!</samp>’ has no special meaning within double quotes, even when history expansion is enabled. The characters ‘<samp>$</samp>’ and ‘<samp>`</samp>’ retain their special meaning within double quotes (see <a href="shell-expansions.html">Shell Expansions</a>). The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: ‘<samp>$</samp>’, ‘<samp>`</samp>’, ‘<samp>"</samp>’, ‘<samp>\</samp>’, or <code>newline</code>. Within double quotes, backslashes that are followed by one of these characters are removed. Backslashes preceding characters without a special meaning are left unmodified. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an ‘<samp>!</samp>’ appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the ‘<samp>!</samp>’ is not removed. </p> <p>The special parameters ‘<samp>*</samp>’ and ‘<samp>@</samp>’ have special meaning when in double quotes (see <a href="shell-parameter-expansion.html">Shell Parameter Expansion</a>). </p><div class="_attribution">
