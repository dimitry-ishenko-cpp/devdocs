<h1 id="fxe0015-fx-node-insert-type-promotion">FXE0015:fx-node-insert-type-promotion</h1> <p>This diagnostic monitors the node-level type promotion insertion process. In PyTorch, there is an automatic process called implicit type promotion, where the input types of an operator are promoted to a common type. The determination of the common type is based on the type promotion rule specific to each operator. To learn more about PyTorchâ€™s type promotion rules, refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/f044613f78df713fb57f70c608483c9f10ad332e/torch/_prims_common/__init__.py#L1252-L1335">elementwise_dtypes doc</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/a475ea4542dfe961c9d097e33ab5041f61c8c17f/torch/_refs/__init__.py#L484">torch._refs ops</a>.</p> <p>However, implicit type promotion is not supported in ONNX. Therefore, to replicate the PyTorch behavior, we need to explicitly insert cast nodes. This diagnostic tracks the process of node-level type promotion insertion.</p> <p>The type promotion rules used by this process can be found in <code>torch/onnx/_internal/fx/passes/type_promotion.py.</code> To update or add new type promotion rules, please refer to the [Note: Update type promotion rule] section.</p><div class="_attribution">
