<h1 id="fxe0014-find-opschema-matched-symbolic-function">FXE0014:find-opschema-matched-symbolic-function</h1> <p>When an ATen/Custom operator is registered and needs to be dispatched to an OnnxFunction, the input/attribute dtypes of the ATen/Custom operator are compared with the input/attribute dtypes of the OnnxFunction opschemas to find a match. However, if a perfect/exact match is not found, the dispatcher will attempt to find the nearest match with the highest number of input/attribute dtypes matching the OnnxFunction opschemas, while issuing a warning.</p> <p>There are two types of level that can be triggered in this rule:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>NOTE: A perfect match is found, and no warning is issued.</li> <li>WARNING: The matched OnnxFunction is not a perfect/exact match.</li> </ol> <p>Here are some suggestions based on the WARNING situation:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>If there are NO errors or mismatches in the results, it is safe to disregard this warning, as the definition of OnnxFunction schema is usually more stringent.</li> <li>If there are errors or mismatches in the results, it is recommended to: (a) Enable op_level_debugging to determine if the OnnxFunction might be incorrect. (b) Report the issue to the PyTorch-ONNX team. (c) Create/register a custom symbolic function to replace the default one.</li> </ol><div class="_attribution">
