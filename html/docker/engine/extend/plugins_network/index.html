 <h1 id="docker-network-driver-plugins">Docker network driver plugins</h1> <p>This document describes Docker Engine network driver plugins generally available in Docker Engine. To view information on plugins managed by Docker Engine, refer to <a href="../index.html">Docker Engine plugin system</a>.</p> <p>Docker Engine network plugins enable Engine deployments to be extended to support a wide range of networking technologies, such as VXLAN, IPVLAN, MACVLAN or something completely different. Network driver plugins are supported via the LibNetwork project. Each plugin is implemented as a “remote driver” for LibNetwork, which shares plugin infrastructure with Engine. Effectively, network driver plugins are activated in the same way as other plugins, and use the same kind of protocol.</p> <h2 id="network-plugins-and-swarm-mode">Network plugins and swarm mode</h2> <p><a href="../legacy_plugins/index.html">Legacy plugins</a> do not work in swarm mode. However, plugins written using the <a href="../index.html">v2 plugin system</a> do work in swarm mode, as long as they are installed on each swarm worker node.</p> <h2 id="use-network-driver-plugins">Use network driver plugins</h2> <p>The means of installing and running a network driver plugin depend on the particular plugin. So, be sure to install your plugin according to the instructions obtained from the plugin developer.</p> <p>Once running however, network driver plugins are used just like the built-in network drivers: by being mentioned as a driver in network-oriented Docker commands. For example,</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ docker network create --driver weave mynet
</pre></div> <p>Some network driver plugins are listed in <a href="../legacy_plugins/index.html">plugins</a></p> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mynet</code> network is now owned by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weave</code>, so subsequent commands referring to that network will be sent to the plugin,</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ docker run --network=mynet busybox top
</pre></div> <h2 id="find-network-plugins">Find network plugins</h2> <p>Network plugins are written by third parties, and are published by those third parties, either on <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?category=network&amp;q=&amp;type=plugin">Docker Store</a> or on the third party’s site.</p> <h2 id="write-a-network-plugin">Write a network plugin</h2> <p>Network plugins implement the <a href="../plugin_api/index.html">Docker plugin API</a> and the network plugin protocol</p> <h2 id="network-plugin-protocol">Network plugin protocol</h2> <p>The network driver protocol, in addition to the plugin activation call, is documented as part of libnetwork: <a href="https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/blob/master/docs/remote/">https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/blob/master/docs/remote.md</a>.</p> <h2 id="related-information">Related Information</h2> <p>To interact with the Docker maintainers and other interested users, see the IRC channel <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#docker-network</code>.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/network/">Docker networks feature overview</a></li> <li>The <a href="https://github.com/docker/libnetwork">LibNetwork</a> project</li> </ul>
