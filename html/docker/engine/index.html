<h1>Docker Engine overview</h1>
<p>Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:</p> <ul> <li>A server with a long-running daemon process <a href="reference/commandline/dockerd/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dockerd</code></a>.</li> <li>APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.</li> <li>A command line interface (CLI) client <a href="reference/commandline/cli/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker</code></a>.</li> </ul> <p>The CLI uses <a href="api/index.html">Docker APIs</a> to control or interact with the Docker daemon through scripting or direct CLI commands. Many other Docker applications use the underlying API and CLI. The daemon creates and manage Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.</p> <p>For more details, see <a href="../get-started/overview/index.html#docker-architecture">Docker Architecture</a>.</p> <h2 id="docker-user-guide">Docker user guide</h2> <p>To learn about Docker in more detail and to answer questions about usage and implementation, check out the <a href="../get-started/overview/index.html">overview page in “get started”</a>.</p> <h2 id="installation-guides">Installation guides</h2> <p>The <a href="install/index.html">installation section</a> shows you how to install Docker on a variety of platforms.</p> <h2 id="release-notes">Release notes</h2> <p>A summary of the changes in each release in the current series can now be found on the separate <a href="release-notes/index.html">Release Notes page</a></p> <h2 id="feature-deprecation-policy">Feature Deprecation Policy</h2> <p>As changes are made to Docker there may be times when existing features need to be removed or replaced with newer features. Before an existing feature is removed it is labeled as “deprecated” within the documentation and remains in Docker for at least 3 stable releases unless specified explicitly otherwise. After that time it may be removed.</p> <p>Users are expected to take note of the list of deprecated features each release and plan their migration away from those features, and (if applicable) towards the replacement features as soon as possible.</p> <p>The complete list of deprecated features can be found on the <a href="deprecated/index.html">Deprecated Features page</a>.</p> <h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2> <p>Docker is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
