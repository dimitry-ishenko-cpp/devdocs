<h1>Event controllers and gestures</h1>
<div class="sect1">  <p> Event controllers are standalone objects that can perform specific actions upon received <a href="https://developer-old.gnome.org/gtk4/html/gdk4-Events.html#GdkEvent-struct"><span class="type">GdkEvents</span></a>. These are tied to a <a href="gtkwidget.html#GtkWidget-struct"><span class="type">GtkWidget</span></a>, and can be told of the event propagation phase at which they will manage the events. </p> <p> Gestures are a set of specific controllers that are prepared to handle pointer and/or touch events, each gesture implementation attempts to recognize specific actions out the received events, notifying of the state/progress accordingly to let the widget react to those. On multi-touch gestures, every interacting touch sequence will be tracked independently. </p> <p> Since gestures are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">simple</span>”</span> units, it is not uncommon to tie several together to perform higher level actions, grouped gestures handle the same event sequences simultaneously, and those sequences share a same state across all grouped gestures. Some examples of grouping may be: </p> <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style="list-style-type: disc; "> <li class="listitem"><p> A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">drag</span>”</span> and a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">swipe</span>”</span> gestures may want grouping. The former will report events as the dragging happens, the latter will tell the swipe X/Y velocities only after recognition has finished. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> Grouping a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">drag</span>”</span> gesture with a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pan</span>”</span> gesture will only effectively allow dragging in the panning orientation, as both gestures share state. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> If <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">press</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">long press</span>”</span> are wanted simultaneously, those would need grouping. </p></li> </ul></div> <p> Shortcuts are handled by <a href="gtkshortcutcontroller.html#GtkShortcutController-struct"><span class="type">GtkShortcutController</span></a>, which is a complex event handler that can either activate shortcuts itself, or propagate them to another controller, depending on its <a href="gtkshortcutcontroller.html#GtkShortcutController--scope"><span class="type">“scope”</span></a>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
