<h1>Action groups and action maps</h1>
<div class="sect1">  <p> Actions rarely occurs in isolation. It is common to have groups of related actions, which are represented by instances of the GActionGroup interface. </p> <p> Action maps are a variant of action groups that allow to change the name of the action as it is looked up. In GTK, the convention is to add a prefix to the action name to indicate the scope of the actions, such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">app.</span>”</span> for the actions with application scope or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">win.</span>”</span> for those with window scope. </p> <p> When referring to actions on a GActionMap only the name of the action itself is used (ie: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">quit</span>”</span>, not <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">app.quit</span>”</span>). The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">app.quit</span>”</span> form is only used when referring to actions from places like a GMenu or GtkActionable widget where the scope of the action is not already known. </p> <p> GtkApplication and GtkApplicationWindow implement the GActionMap interface, so you can just add actions directly to them. For other widgets, use <a href="gtkwidget.html#gtk-widget-insert-action-group"><code class="function">gtk_widget_insert_action_group()</code></a> to add actions to it. </p> <p> If you want to insert several actions at the same time, it is typically faster and easier to use GActionEntry. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
