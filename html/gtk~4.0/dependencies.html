<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<div class="sect1">  <p> Before you can compile the GTK widget toolkit, you need to have various other tools and libraries installed on your system. Dependencies of GTK have their own build systems, so you will need to refer to their own installation instructions. </p> <p> A particular important tool used by GTK to find its dependencies is <code class="literal">pkg-config</code>. </p> <p> <a class="ulink" href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/" target="_top">pkg-config</a> is a tool for tracking the compilation flags needed for libraries that are used by the GTK libraries. (For each library, a small <code class="literal">.pc</code> text file is installed in a standard location that contains the compilation flags needed for that library along with version number information.) </p> <p> Some of the libraries that GTK depends on are maintained by the GTK team: GLib, GdkPixbuf, Pango, and GObject Introspection. Other libraries are maintained separately. </p> <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style="list-style-type: disc; "> <li class="listitem"><p> The GLib library provides core non-graphical functionality such as high level data types, Unicode manipulation, and an object and type system to C programs. It is available from <a class="ulink" href="https://download.gnome.org/sources/glib/" target="_top">here</a>. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> The <a class="ulink" href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk-pixbuf/" target="_top">GdkPixbuf</a> library provides facilities for loading images in a variety of file formats. It is available <a class="ulink" href="https://developer-old.gnome.org/gdk-pixbuf/stable/" target="_top">here</a>. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> <a class="ulink" href="http://www.pango.org" target="_top">Pango</a> is a library for internationalized text handling. It is available <a class="ulink" href="https://download.gnome.org/sources/pango/" target="_top">here</a>. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection" target="_top">GObject Introspection</a> is a framework for making introspection data available to language bindings. It is available <a class="ulink" href="https://download.gnome.org/sources/gobject-introspection/" target="_top">here</a>. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> The <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/" target="_top">GNU libiconv</a> library is needed to build GLib if your system doesn’t have the <code class="function">iconv()</code> function for doing conversion between character encodings. Most modern systems should have <code class="function">iconv()</code>. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> The libintl library from the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/" target="_top">GNU gettext</a> package is needed if your system doesn’t have the <code class="function">gettext()</code> functionality for handling message translation databases. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> The libraries from the X window system are needed to build Pango and GTK. You should already have these installed on your system, but it’s possible that you’ll need to install the development environment for these libraries that your operating system vendor provides. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> The <a class="ulink" href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/" target="_top">fontconfig</a> library provides Pango with a standard way of locating fonts and matching them against font names. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> <a class="ulink" href="https://www.cairographics.org" target="_top">Cairo</a> is a graphics library that supports vector graphics and image compositing. Both Pango and GTK use Cairo for drawing. Note that we also need the auxiliary cairo-gobject library. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy" target="_top">libepoxy</a> is a library that abstracts the differences between different OpenGL libraries. GTK uses it for cross-platform GL support and for its own drawing. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> <a class="ulink" href="http://ebassi.github.io/graphene/" target="_top">Graphene</a> is a library that provides vector and matrix types for 2D and 3D transformations. GTK uses it internally for drawing. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> The <a class="ulink" href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org" target="_top">Wayland</a> libraries are needed to build GTK with the Wayland backend. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> The <a class="ulink" href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/shared-mime-info" target="_top">shared-mime-info</a> package is not a hard dependency of GTK, but it contains definitions for mime types that are used by GIO and, indirectly, by GTK. gdk-pixbuf will use GIO for mime type detection if possible. For this to work, shared-mime-info needs to be installed and <code class="literal">XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> set accordingly at configure time. Otherwise, gdk-pixbuf falls back to its built-in mime type detection. </p></li> </ul></div> </div><div class="_attribution">
