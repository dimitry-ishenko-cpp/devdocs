<h1>Keyboard input</h1>
<div class="sect1">  <p> Every <a href="gtkwindow.html#GtkWindow-struct"><span class="type">GtkWindow</span></a> maintains a single focus location (in the <a href="gtkwindow.html#GtkWindow--focus-widget"><span class="type">“focus-widget”</span></a> property). The focus widget is the target widget for key events sent to the window. Only widgets which have <a href="gtkwidget.html#GtkWidget--can-focus"><span class="type">“can-focus”</span></a> set to <code class="literal">TRUE</code> can become the focus. Typically these are input controls such as entries or text fields, but e.g. buttons can take the focus too. </p> <p> Input widgets can be given the focus by clicking on them, but focus can also be moved around with certain key events (this is known as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">keyboard navigation</span>”</span>). GTK reserves the Tab key to move the focus to the next location, and Shift-Tab to move it back to the previous one. In addition many containers allow <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">directional navigation</span>”</span> with the arrow keys. </p> <p> Many widgets can be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">activated</span>”</span> to trigger and action. E.g., you can activate a button or switch by clicking on them, but you can also activate them with the keyboard, by using the Enter or Space keys. </p> <p> Apart from keyboard navigation, activation and directly typing into entries or text views, GTK widgets can use key events for activating <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">shortcuts</span>”</span>. Shortcuts generally act as a quick way to move the focus around or to activate a widget that does not currently have the focus. </p> <p> GTK has traditionally supported different kinds of shortcuts: </p> <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style="list-style-type: disc; "> <li class="listitem"><p> Accelerators are any other shortcuts that can be activated regardless of where the focus is, and typically trigger global actions, such as Ctrl-Q to quit an application. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> Mnemonics are usually triggered using Alt as a modifier for a letter. They are used in places where a label is associated with a control, and are indicated by underlining the letter in the label. As a special case, inside menus (i.e. inside <a href="gtkpopovermenu.html#GtkPopoverMenu-struct"><span class="type">GtkPopoverMenu</span></a>), mnemonics can be triggered without the modifier. </p></li> <li class="listitem"><p> Key bindings are specific to individual widgets, such as Ctrl-C or Ctrl-V in an entry copy to or paste from the clipboard. They are only triggered when the widget has focus. </p></li> </ul></div> <p> GTK handles accelerators and mnemonics in a global scope, during the capture phase, and key bindings locally, during the target phase. </p> <p> Under the hood, all shortcuts are represented as instances of <a href="gtkshortcut.html#GtkShortcut-struct"><span class="type">GtkShortcut</span></a>, and they are managed by <a href="gtkshortcutcontroller.html#GtkShortcutController-struct"><span class="type">GtkShortcutController</span></a>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
