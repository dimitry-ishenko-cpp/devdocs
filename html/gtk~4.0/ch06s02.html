<h1>Action state and parameters</h1>
<div class="sect1">  <p> Most actions in your application will be stateless actions with no parameters. These typically appear as menu items with no special decoration. An example is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">quit</span>”</span>. </p> <p> Stateful actions are used to represent an action which has a closely-associated state of some kind. A good example is a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fullscreen</span>”</span> action. For this case, you would expect to see a checkmark next to the menu item when the fullscreen option is active. This is usually called a toggle action, and it has a boolean state. By convention, toggle actions have no parameter type for activation: activating the action always toggles the state. </p> <p> Another common case is to have an action representing a enumeration of possible values of a given type (typically string). This is often called a radio action and is usually represented in the user interface with radio buttons or radio menu items, or sometimes a combobox. A good example is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">text-justify</span>”</span> with possible values <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">left</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">center</span>”</span>, and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">right</span>”</span>. By convention, these types of actions have a parameter type equal to their state type, and activating them with a particular parameter value is equivalent to changing their state to that value. </p> <p> This approach to handling radio buttons is different than many other action systems such as GtkAction. With GAction, there is only one action for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">text-justify</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">left</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">center</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">right</span>”</span> are possible states on that action. There are not three separate <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">justify-left</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">justify-center</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">justify-right</span>”</span> actions. </p> <p> The final common type of action is a stateless action with a parameter. This is typically used for actions like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">open-bookmark</span>”</span> where the parameter to the action would be the identifier of the bookmark to open. </p> <p> Because some types of actions cannot be invoked without a parameter, it is often important to specify a parameter when referring to the action from a place where it will be invoked (such as from a radio button that sets the state to a particular value or from a menu item that opens a specific bookmark). In these contexts, the value used for the action parameter is typically called the target of the action. </p> <p> Even though toggle actions have a state, they do not have a parameter. Therefore, a target value is not needed when referring to them — they will always be toggled on activation. </p> <p> Most APIs that allow using a GAction (such as GMenuModel and GtkActionable) allow use of detailed action names. This is a convenient way of specifying an action name and an action target with a single string. </p> <p> In the case that the action target is a string with no unusual characters (ie: only alphanumeric, plus <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">-</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">.</span>”</span>) then you can use a detailed action name of the form <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">justify::left</span>”</span> to specify the justify action with a target of left. </p> <p> In the case that the action target is not a string, or contains unusual characters, you can use the more general format <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">action-name(5)</span>”</span>, where the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">5</span>”</span> here is any valid text-format GVariant (ie: a string that can be parsed by <code class="function">g_variant_parse()</code>). Another example is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">open-bookmark(<span class="quote">‘<span class="quote">http://gnome.org/</span>’</span>)</span>”</span>. </p> <p> You can convert between detailed action names and split-out action names and target values using <code class="function">g_action_parse_detailed_name()</code> and <code class="function">g_action_print_detailed_name()</code> but usually you will not need to. Most APIs will provide both ways of specifying actions with targets. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
