<h1>Connecting actions to widgets</h1>
<div class="sect1">  <p> Any widget that implements the GtkActionable interface can be connected to an action just by setting the ::action-name property. If the action has a parameter, you will also need to set the ::action-target property. Widgets that implement GtkActionable include GtkSwitch, GtkButton, and their respective subclasses. </p> <p> Another way of obtaining widgets that are connected to actions is to create a menu using a GMenu menu model. GMenu provides an abstract way to describe typical menus: nested groups of items where each item can have a label, and icon, and an action. </p> <p> A typical use of GMenu inside GTK is to set up an application menubar with <a href="gtkapplication.html#gtk-application-set-menubar"><code class="function">gtk_application_set_menubar()</code></a>. Another, maybe more common use is to create a popover for a menubutton, using <a href="gtkmenubutton.html#gtk-menu-button-set-menu-model"><code class="function">gtk_menu_button_set_menu_model()</code></a>. </p> <p> Unlike traditional menus, those created from menu models donâ€™t have keyboard accelerators associated with menu items. Instead, GtkApplication offers the <a href="gtkapplication.html#gtk-application-set-accels-for-action"><code class="function">gtk_application_set_accels_for_action()</code></a> API to associate keyboard shortcuts with actions. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
