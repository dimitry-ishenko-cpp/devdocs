For example, a backend compiler may consist of backward graph tracing (AOTAutograd) and graph lowering (TorchInductor)*. Errors can occur in any component of the stack and will provide full stack traces.</p> <p>To determine in which component an error occurred, you may use info-level logging <code>torch._logging.set_logs(dynamo = logging.INFO)</code> or <code>TORCH_LOGS="dynamo"</code> and look for <code>Step #: ...</code> outputs. Logs are made at the beginning and end of each step, so the step that an error should correspond to is the most recently logged step whose end has not yet been logged. The steps correspond to the following parts of the stack:</p> <table class="docutils colwidths-auto align-default"> <thead> <tr>

<td><p>3</p></td> <td><p>TorchInductor</p></td> </tr>  </table> <p>If info logging is insufficient, you can use available backend options. These options include:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>"eager"</code>: only runs TorchDynamo forward graph capture and then runs the captured graph with PyTorch. This provides an indication as to whether TorchDynamo is raising the error.</li> <li>
<code>"aot_eager"</code>: runs TorchDynamo to capture a forward graph, and then AOTAutograd to trace the backward graph without any additional backend compiler steps. PyTorch eager will then be used to run the forward and backward graphs. This is useful to narrow down the issue to AOTAutograd.</li> </ul> <p>The general procedure to narrow down an issue is the following:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>Run your program with the <code>"eager"</code> backend. If the error no longer occurs, the issue is in the backend compiler that is being used (if using TorchInductor, proceed to step 2. If not, see <a class="reference external" href="#minifying-backend-compiler-errors">this section</a>). If the error still occurs with the <code>"eager"</code> backend, it is an <a class="reference external" href="#torchdynamo-errors">error while running torchdynamo</a>.</li> <li>This step is only necessary if <code>TorchInductor</code> is used as the backend compiler. Run the model with the <code>"aot_eager"</code> backend. If this backend raises an error then the error is occurring during AOTAutograd tracing. If the error no longer occurs with this backend, then <a class="reference external" href="#minifying-torchinductor-errors">the error is in TorchInductor*</a>.</li> </ol> <p>Each of these cases are analyzed in the following sections.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The TorchInductor backend consists of both AOTAutograd tracing and the TorchInductor compiler itself. We will disambiguate by referring to <code>TorchInductor</code> as the backend, and TorchInductor lowering as the phase which lowers the graph traced by AOTAutograd.</p> </div>  <h3 id="torchdynamo-errors">Torchdynamo Errors</h3> <p>If the error that is generated occurs with the <code>"eager"</code> backend, then TorchDynamo is most likely the source of the error. Here is a sample code which will generate an error.</p> <pre data-language="py">import torch

import torch._dynamo as dynamo


def test_assertion_error():
    y = torch.ones(200, 200)

Set torch._dynamo.config.verbose=True for more information
==========
</pre> <p>As the message suggests you can set <code>torch._dynamo.config.verbose=True</code> to get a full stack trace to both the error in TorchDynamo and the user code. In addition to this flag, you can also set the <code>log_level</code> of TorchDynamo through <code>torch._dynamo.config.log_level</code>. These levels include:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>logging.DEBUG</code>: Print every instruction that is encountered in addition to all the log levels listed below.</li> <li>
<code>logging.INFO</code>: Print each function that is compiled (original and modified bytecode) and the graph that is captured in addition to all the log levels listed below.</li> <li>
<code>logging.WARNING</code> (default): Print graph breaks in addition to all the log levels listed below.</li> <li>
<code>logging.ERROR</code>: Print errors only.</li> </ul> <p>If a model is very large, the logs can become overwhelming. If an error occurs deep within a model’s Python code, it can be useful to execute only the frame in which the error occurs to enable easier debugging. There are two tools available to enable this:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Setting the environment variable <code>TORCHDYNAMO_DEBUG_FUNCTION</code> to the desired function name will only run torchdynamo on functions with that name.</li> <li>Enabling the record/replay tool (set <code>torch._dynamo.config.replay_record_enabled = True</code>) which dumps an execution record when an error is encountered. This record can then be replayed to run only the frame where an error occurred.</li> </ul>   <h3 id="diagnosing-torchinductor-errors">Diagnosing TorchInductor Errors</h3> <p>If the error does not occur with the <code>"eager"</code> backend, then the backend compiler is the source of the error (<a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/mlazos/2f13681e3cc6c43b3911f336327032de%5D">example error</a>). There are <a class="reference external" href="torch.compiler.rst.html">different choices</a> for backend compilers for TorchDynamo, with TorchInductor fitting the needs of most users. This section focuses on TorchInductor as the motivating example, but some tools can also be used with other backend compilers.</p> <p>Below is the portion of the stack which we are focusing on:</p> <p>With TorchInductor as the chosen backend, AOTAutograd is used to generate the backward graph from the forward graph captured by torchdynamo. It is important to note that errors can occur during this tracing and also while TorchInductor lowers the forward and backward graphs to GPU code or C++. A model can often consist of hundreds or thousands of FX nodes, so narrowing the exact nodes where this problem occurred can be very difficult. Fortunately, there are tools available to automatically minify these input graphs to the nodes which are causing the issue. The first step is to determine whether the error occurs during tracing of the backward graph with AOTAutograd or during TorchInductor lowering. As mentioned above in step 2, the <code>"aot_eager"</code> backend can be used to run only AOTAutograd in isolation without lowering. If the error still occurs with this backend, this indicates that the error is occurring during AOTAutograd tracing.</p> <p>Here is an example:</p> <pre data-language="py">import torch

import torch._dynamo as dynamo

model = torch.nn.Sequential(*[torch.nn.Linear(200, 200) for _ in range(5)])

def test_backend_error():

    y = torch.ones(200, 200)
    x = torch.ones(200, 200)
    z = x + y
    a = torch.ops.aten._foobar(z)  # dummy function which errors
    return model(a)


compiled_test_backend_error = torch.compile(test_backend_error, backend="inductor")
compiled_test_backend_error()
</pre> <p>Running this should give you this error with a longer stack trace below it:</p> <pre data-language="python">Traceback (most recent call last):

Setting the environment variable <code>TORCHDYNAMO_REPRO_AFTER=“aot”</code> (or setting <code>torch._dynamo.config.repro_after="aot"</code> directly) will generate a Python program which reduces the graph produced by AOTAutograd to the smallest subgraph which reproduces the error. (See below for an example where we minify the graph produced by TorchDynamo) Running the program with this environment variable should show nearly <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/mlazos/0458ab828aa403c779fe73c012aa5982">identical output</a>, with an additional line indicating where <code>minifier_launcher.py</code> has been written to. The output directory is configurable by setting <code>torch._dynamo.config.base_dir</code> to a valid directory name. The final step is to run the minifier and check that it runs successfully. A successful run looks like <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/mlazos/e6ea41ccce68a7b1b8a7a09acb1b206a">this</a>.

This mode disables TorchDynamo’s Python fallback, and only succeeds if the entire program is convertible into a single graph. Example usage:</p> <pre data-language="python">def toy_example(a, b):
   ...

compiled_toy = torch.compile(toy_example, fullgraph=True, backend=&lt;compiler&gt;)
</pre>  <h3 id="excessive-recompilation">Excessive Recompilation</h3> <p>When TorchDynamo compiles a function (or part of one), it makes certain assumptions about locals and globals in order to allow compiler optimizations, and expresses these assumptions as guards that check particular values at runtime. If any of these guards fail, Dynamo will recompile that function (or part) up to <code>torch._dynamo.config.cache_size_limit</code> times. If your program is hitting the cache limit, you will first need to determine which guard is failing and what part of your program is triggering it.</p> <p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/utils.py">compile profiler</a> automates the process of setting TorchDynamo’s cache limit to 1 and running your program under an observation-only ‘compiler’ that records the causes of any guard failures. You should be sure to run your program for at least as long (as many iterations) as you were running when you ran into trouble, and the profiler will accumulate statistics over this duration.</p> <p>If your program exhibits a bounded amount of dynamism, you may be able to tune the TorchDynamo cache limit to allow for each variation to be compiled and cached, but if the cache limit is too high you may find the cost of recompilation outweighs any optimization benefits.</p> <pre data-language="python">torch._dynamo.config.cache_size_limit = &lt;your desired cache limit&gt;
</pre> <p>TorchDynamo plans to support many common cases of dynamic tensor shapes, such as varying batch size or sequence length. It does not plan to support rank-dynamism. In the meantime, setting a specific cache limit can be used in coordination with bucketing techniques to achieve an acceptable number of recompilations for some dynamic models.</p> <pre data-language="python">from torch._dynamo.utils import CompileProfiler

def my_model():
    ...

with CompileProfiler() as prof:
    profiler_model = torch.compile(my_model, backend=prof)
    profiler_model()
    print(prof.report())
</pre>    <h2 id="accuracy-debugging">Accuracy Debugging</h2> <p>Accuracy issues can also be minified if you set the environment variable <code>TORCHDYNAMO_REPRO_LEVEL=4</code>, it operates with a similar git bisect model and a full repro might be something like <code>TORCHDYNAMO_REPRO_AFTER="aot" TORCHDYNAMO_REPRO_LEVEL=4</code> the reason we need this is downstream compilers will codegen code whether it’s Triton code or the C++ backend, the numerics from those downstream compilers can be different in subtle ways yet have dramatic impact on your training stability. So the accuracy debugger is very useful for us to detect bugs in our codegen or with a backend compiler.</p> <p>If you’d like to ensure that random number generation is the same across both torch and triton then you can enable <code>torch._inductor.config.fallback_random = True</code></p><div class="_attribution">
