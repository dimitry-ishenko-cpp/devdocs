It provides a mechanism to launch multiple GPU operations through a single CPU operation, and hence reduces the launching overheads.</p> <p>CUDA Graphs can give large speedups, especially for models with high CPU overhead or small compute. There are a number of limitations from requiring the same kernels to be run with the same arguments and dependencies, and memory addresses.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Control Flow is not possible</li> <li>Kernels which trigger host to device syncs (such as .item()) errors</li> <li>All input arguments to kernels are fixed to what they were recorded</li> <li>CUDA Memory addresses are fixed, however the values of the memory at those addresses can change</li> <li>No Essential CPU ops or CPU side effects</li> </ul>   <h2 id="pytorch-cudagraph-integration">PyTorch CUDAGraph Integration</h2> <p>PyTorch provides a <a class="reference external" href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cuda.CUDAGraph.html">convenience wrapper</a> around CUDAGraphs that handles a couple of tricky interactions with PyTorch’s caching allocator.</p> <p>The CachingAllocator uses a separate memory pool for all the new allocations. During CUDAGraph recording, memory is accounted for, allocated, and freed exactly as during eager run. On replay, just the kernels are invoked, and there are no changes to the allocator. Subsequent to initial recording, the allocator does not know which memory is actively being used in user programs.</p> <p>Using a separate memory pool between eager allocations and cudagraph allocations may increase the memory of your program if there is substantial memory allocated to both.</p>   <h2 id="make-graphed-callables">Make Graphed Callables</h2> <p><a class="reference external" href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables.html">Make Graphed Callables</a> is a PyTorch Abstraction to share a single memory pool over a series of callables. Graphed Callables takes advantage of the fact that on CUDA Graph recording, memory is exactly accounted for by the caching allocator to safely share memory between separate CUDA Graph recordings. In each invocation, outputs are preserved as live memory, preventing one callable from overwriting the live memory of another. Graphed Callables can only be invoked in a single order; memory addresses from the first run are burned into the second, and so forth.</p>   <h2 id="torchdynamo-previous-cuda-graphs-integration">TorchDynamo Previous CUDA Graphs Integration</h2> <p>Running with <code>cudagraph_trees=False</code> does not reuse memory across separate graph captures, which can lead to large memory regressions. Even for a model that has no graph breaks, this has issues. The forward and backward are separate graph captures, so the memory pools for forward and backward are not shared. In particular, memory for activations that are saved in the forward cannot be reclaimed in the backward.</p>   <h2 id="cudagraph-trees-integration">CUDAGraph Trees Integration</h2> <p>Like Graph Callables, CUDA Graph Trees use a single memory pool across all graph captures. However, instead of requiring a single sequence of invocations, CUDA Graph Trees create separate trees of CUDA Graph captures. Let’s take a look at an illustrative example:</p> <pre data-language="python">@torch.compile
def foo(x):
    # GRAPH 1
    y = x * x * x
    # graph break triggered here
    if y.sum() &gt; 0:
        # GRAPH 2
        z = y ** y
    else:
        # GRAPH 3
        z = (y.abs() ** y.abs())
    torch._dynamo.graph_break()
    # GRAPH 4
    return z * torch.rand_like(z)

    # the first run warms up each graph, which does things like CuBlas or Triton benchmarking
    foo(torch.arange(0, 10), device="cuda")
    # The second run does a CUDA Graph recording, and replays it
    foo(torch.arange(0, 10), device="cuda")
    # Finally we hit the optimized, CUDA Graph replay path
    foo(torch.arange(0, 10), device="cuda")
</pre> <p>In this example, there are two separate paths that we make through the function: 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4, or 1 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4.</p> <p>We share all of the memory in a single memory pool between separate recordings by building up a tape of CUDA Graph recordings, in this instance, 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4. We add invariants to ensure that memory is always in the same location as it were recorded, and no live tensors exist in user programs that might be overwritten.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Same constraints from CUDA Graphs apply: same kernels must be invoked with the same arguments (static sizes, addresses, etc)</li> <li>The same pattern of memory must be observed between recording and replay: if a tensor output of one graph dies subsequent to another graph during recording, it must also do so during replay.</li> <li>Live memory in the CUDA pool forces a dependence between two recordings</li> <li>These recordings can only be invoked in a single order 1 - &gt; 2 -&gt; 4</li> </ul> <p>All of the memory is shared in a single memory pool, so there is no additional memory overhead compared to eager. Now, what happens if we were to hit a new path and run Graph 3?</p> <p>Graph 1 gets replayed, and then we hit Graph 3, which we have not yet recorded. On graph replays, the private memory pool is not updated, so y is not reflected in the allocator. Without care, we would overwrite it. To support reusing the same memory pool after replaying other graphs, we checkpoint the memory pool back to its state at the end of graph 1. Now that our live tensors are reflected in the caching allocator, we are safe to run a new graph.</p> <p>First, we would hit the optimized, CUDAGraph.replay() path that we have already recorded in graph 1. Then we would hit Graph 3. Just as before, we will need to warm up the graph once before recording. On the warmup run, the memory addresses are not fixed, so graph 4 will also fallback to the inductor, non-cudagraph invocation.</p> <p>The second time we hit graph 3 we are warmed up and ready to record. We record graph 2 and then record graph 4 again since the input memory addresses have changed. This creates a tree of CUDA Graph recordings. A CUDA Graph Tree!</p> <pre data-language="python">  1

</pre>   <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2> <p>Because CUDA Graph fixes memory addresses, CUDA Graphs do not have a great way of handling live tensors from a previous invocation.</p> <p>Let’s say we are benchmarking running inference with the following code:</p> <pre data-language="python">import torch

def my_model(x):
    y = torch.matmul(x, x)
    return y

x = torch.randn(10, 10)
y1 = my_model(x)
y2 = my_model(x)
</pre> <p>In the Separate CUDA Graph implementation, the output from the first invocation will be overwritten by the second invocation. Similarly, in CUDA Graph Trees, naively, the live output of the first run would force a dependency between the first run and the second run, and we would never hit the optimized cudagraph replay invocation. CUDA Graph Trees will ignore outputs from a previous run of torch.compile and not force a memory dependency. In training, we will not ignore outputs from a previous run of torch.compile if we have pending backwards that have not been invoked.
