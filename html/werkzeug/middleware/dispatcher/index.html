<h1 id="module-werkzeug.middleware.dispatcher">Application Dispatcher</h1> <p>This middleware creates a single WSGI application that dispatches to multiple other WSGI applications mounted at different URL paths.</p> <p>A common example is writing a Single Page Application, where you have a backend API and a frontend written in JavaScript that does the routing in the browser rather than requesting different pages from the server. The frontend is a single HTML and JS file that should be served for any path besides “/api”.</p> <p>This example dispatches to an API app under “/api”, an admin app under “/admin”, and an app that serves frontend files for all other requests:</p> <pre data-language="python">app = DispatcherMiddleware(serve_frontend, {
    '/api': api_app,
    '/admin': admin_app,
})
</pre> <p>In production, you might instead handle this at the HTTP server level, serving files or proxying to application servers based on location. The API and admin apps would each be deployed with a separate WSGI server, and the static files would be served directly by the HTTP server.</p> <dl class="py class"> <dt class="sig sig-object py" id="werkzeug.middleware.dispatcher.DispatcherMiddleware">
