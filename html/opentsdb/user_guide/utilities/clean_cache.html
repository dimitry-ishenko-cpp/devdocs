<h1>clean_cache.sh</h1> <p>OpenTSDB uses a directory for caching graphs and gnuplot scripts. Unfortunately it doesn't clean up after itself at this time so a simple shell script is included to purge all files in the directory if drive where the directory resides drops below 10% of free space. Simply add this script as a cron entry and set it to run as often as you like.</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p> <p class="last">This script will purge all files in the directory. Don't store anything important in the temp directory.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
