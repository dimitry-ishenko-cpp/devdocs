<h1>Stats</h1> <p>OpenTSDB offers a number of metrics about its performance, accessible via various API endpoints. The main stats are accessible from the GUI via the "Stats" tab, from the Http API at <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/api/stats</span></code> or the legacy API at <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/stats</span></code>. The Telnet style API also supports the "stats" command for fetching over CLI. These can easily be published right back into OpenTSDB at any interval you like.</p> <p>Additional stats available include JVM information, storage details (e.g. per-region-client HBase stats) and executed query details. See <a class="reference internal" href="../api_http/stats/index.html"><em>/api/stats</em></a> for more details about the other endpoints.</p> <p>All metrics from the main stats endpoint include a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">host</span></code> tag that includes the name of the host where the TSD is running. If the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tsd.stats.canonical</span></code> configuration flag is set, this will change to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fqdn</span></code> and the TSD will try to resolve its host name to return the fully qualified domain name. Currently all stats are integer values. Each request for stats will fetch statistics in real time so the timestamp will reflect the current time on the TSD host.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/api/stats</span></code> endpoint is a good place to execute a health check for your TSD as it will execute a query to storage for fetching UID stats. If the TSD is unable to reach the backing store, the API will return an exception.</p> </div> <table class="docutils"> <colgroup> <col width="20%"> <col width="20%"> <col width="10%"> <col width="50%"> </colgroup> <thead valign="bottom"> <tr class="row-odd">
