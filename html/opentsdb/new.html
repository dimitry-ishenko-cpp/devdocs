<h1>What's New</h1> <p>OpenTSDB has a thriving community who contributed and requested a number of new features.</p>  <h2>3.X (Planned)</h2> <p>While 3.0 is still a ways off, we'll be pushing some of the new features into a new branch of the repo. Some are in progress and other features are planned. If you have any features that you want to see, let us know.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Distributed Queries - Based on the great work of Turn on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/turn/splicer">Splicer</a> we have a distributed query layer to split queries amongst multiple TSDs for greater throughput.</li> <li>Query Caching - Improve queries with time-sharded caching of results.</li> <li>Improved Expressions - Perform group by, downsampling and arithmetic modifications in any order. Potentially support UDFs as well.</li> <li>Anomaly Processing/Forecasting - Integrate with modeling libraries (such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/yahoo/egads">EGADs</a>) for deeper time series analysis.</li> </ul>   <h2>2.4 (Planned)</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>Rollup/Pre-Aggregates - Support for storing and querying time-based rolled up data and/or pre-aggregated values.</li> <li>Distributed Percentile - Store histograms (or sketches) for calculating proper percentiles over multiple sources.</li> </ul>   <h2>2.3</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>Expressions - Query time computations using time series data. For example, dividing one metric by another.</li> <li>Graphite Style Functions - Additional filtering and mutation of data at query time using Graphite style functions.</li> <li>Calendar Based Downsampling - The ability to align downsampled data on Gregorian calendar boundaries.</li> <li>Bigtable Support - Run TSDB in the cloud using Google's hosted Bigtable service.</li> <li>Cassandra Support - Support for running OpenTSDB on legacy Cassandra clusters.</li> <li>Write Filters - Block or allow time series or UID assignments based on plugins or whitelists.</li> <li>New Aggregators - None for returning raw data. First and Last to return the first or last data points during downsampling.</li> <li>Meta Data Cache Plugin - A new API for caching meta data to improve query performance.</li> <li>Startup Plugins - APIs to help with service discovery on TSD startup.</li> <li>Example Java API usage classes.</li> </ul>   <h2>2.2</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>Appends - Support writing all data points for an hour in a single column. This saves the need for TSD compactions and reduces network traffic at query time.</li> <li>Salting - Enables greater distribution of writes for high cardinality metrics as well as asynchronous scanning for improved query speed. (Non backwards compatible)</li> <li>Random Metric UIDs - Enables better distribution of writes when creating new metrics</li> <li>Storage Exception Plugin - Enables various handling of data points when HBase is unavailable</li> <li>Secure AsyncHBase - Access HBase clusters requiring Kerberos or simple authentication along with optional encryption.</li> <li>Fill Policy - Enable emitting NaNs or Nulls via the JSON query endpoint when data points are "missing"</li> <li>Count and Percentiles - New aggregator functions</li> <li>More Stats - Gives greater insight into query performance via the query stats endpoint and new stats for threads, region clients and the JVM</li> <li>Annotations - Scan for multiple annotations only via the /api/annotations endpoint</li> <li>Query Filters - New filters for flexibility including case (in)sensitive literals, wildcards and regular expressions.</li> <li>Override Tag Widths - You can now override tag widths in the config instead of having to recompile the code.</li> <li>Compaction Tuning - New parameters allow for tuning the TSD compaction process.</li> <li>Delete Data And UIDs - Allow for deleting data at query time as well as removing UIDs from the system.</li> <li>Synchronous Writing - The HTTP Put API now supports synchronous writing to make sure data is flushed to HBase.</li> <li>Query Stats - Query details are now logged that include timing statistics. A new endpoint also shows running and completed queries.</li> </ul>   <h2>2.1</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>Downsampling - Timestamps are now aligned on modulus boundaries, reducing the need to interpolation across series.</li> <li>Last Data Point API - Query for the last data point for specific time series within a certain time window</li> <li>Duplicates - Handle duplicate data points at query time or during FSCK</li> <li>FSCK - An updated FSCK utility that iterates over the main data table, finding and fixing errors</li> <li>Read/Write Modes - Block assigning UIDs on individual TSDs for backup clusters</li> <li>UID Cache - Preload portions of the UID table on startup to improve writes</li> </ul>   <h2>2.0</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>Lock-less UID Assignment - Drastically improves write speed when storing new metrics, tag names, or values</li> <li>Restful API - Provides access to all of OpenTSDB's features as well as offering new options, defaulting to JSON</li> <li>Cross Origin Resource Sharing - For the API so you can make AJAX calls easily</li> <li>Store Data Via HTTP - Write data points over HTTP as an alternative to Telnet</li> <li>Configuration File - A key/value file shared by the TSD and command line tools</li> <li>Pluggable Serializers - Enable different inputs and outputs for the API</li> <li>Annotations - Record meta data about specific time series or data points</li> <li>Meta Data - Record meta data for each time series, metrics, tag names, or values</li> <li>Trees - Flatten metric and tag combinations into a single name for navigation or usage with different tools</li> <li>Search Plugins - Send meta data to search engines to delve into your data and figure out what's in your database</li> <li>Real-Time Publishing Plugin - Send data to external systems as they arrive to your TSD</li> <li>Ingest Plugins - Accept data points in different formats</li> <li>Millisecond Resolution - Optionally store data with millisecond precision</li> <li>Variable Length Encoding - Use less storage space for smaller integer values</li> <li>Non-Interpolating Aggregation Functions - For situations where you require raw data</li> <li>Rate Counter Calculations - Handle roll-over and anomaly supression</li> <li>Additional Statistics - Including the number of UIDs assigned and available</li> </ul> <p>Thank you to everyone who has contributed to 2.3.
