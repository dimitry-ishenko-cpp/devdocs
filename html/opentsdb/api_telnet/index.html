<h1>Telnet Style API</h1> <p>The original way of interacting with OpenTSDB was through a Telnet style API. A user or application simply had to open a socket to the TSD and start sending ASCII string commands and expect a response. This documentation lists the various commands provided by OpenTSDB.</p> <p>Each command must be sent as a series of strings with a <strong>new line</strong> character terminating the request.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">Connections will be closed after a period of inactivity, typically 5 minutes.</p> </div> <p>If a command is sent to the API that is not supported or recognized, a response similar to the following will be shown:</p> <pre data-language="python">unknown command: nosuchcommand.  Try `help'.
</pre>
 <p>At any time the connection can be closed by issuing the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">exit</span></code> command.</p> <div class="toctree-wrapper compound"> <ul> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="put.html">put</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="rollup.html">rollup</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="stats.html">stats</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="version.html">version</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="help.html">help</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="dropcaches.html">dropcaches</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="diediedie.html">diediedie</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
