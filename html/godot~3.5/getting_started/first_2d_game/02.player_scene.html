<h1 id="doc-your-first-2d-game-player-scene">Creating the player scene</h1> <p>With the project settings in place, we can start working on the player-controlled character.</p> <p>The first scene will define the <code>Player</code> object. One of the benefits of creating a separate Player scene is that we can test it separately, even before we've created other parts of the game.</p> <section id="node-structure"> <h2>Node structure</h2> <p>To begin, we need to choose a root node for the player object. As a general rule, a scene's root node should reflect the object's desired functionality - what the object <em>is</em>. Click the "Other Node" button and add an <a href="../../classes/class_area2d.html#class-area2d"><span class="std std-ref">Area2D</span></a> node to the scene.</p> <img alt="../../_images/add_node.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/_images/add_node.png"> <p>Godot will display a warning icon next to the node in the scene tree. You can ignore it for now. We will address it later.</p> <p>With <code>Area2D</code> we can detect objects that overlap or run into the player. Change the node's name to <code>Player</code> by double-clicking on it. Now that we've set the scene's root node, we can add additional nodes to give it more functionality.</p> <p>Before we add any children to the <code>Player</code> node, we want to make sure we don't accidentally move or resize them by clicking on them. Select the node and click the icon to the right of the lock; its tooltip says "Makes sure the object's children are not selectable."</p> <img alt="../../_images/lock_children.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/_images/lock_children.png"> <p>Save the scene. Click Scene -&gt; Save, or press <kbd class="kbd compound docutils literal notranslate"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">S</kbd></kbd> on Windows/Linux or <kbd class="kbd compound docutils literal notranslate"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Cmd</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">S</kbd></kbd> on macOS.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>For this project, we will be following the Godot naming conventions.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<strong>GDScript</strong>: Classes (nodes) use PascalCase, variables and functions use snake_case, and constants use ALL_CAPS (See <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html#doc-gdscript-styleguide"><span class="std std-ref">GDScript style guide</span></a>).</li> <li>
<strong>C#</strong>: Classes, export variables and methods use PascalCase, private fields use _camelCase, local variables and parameters use camelCase (See <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_style_guide.html#doc-c-sharp-styleguide"><span class="std std-ref">C# style guide</span></a>). Be careful to type the method names precisely when connecting signals.</li> </ul> </div> </section> <section id="sprite-animation"> <h2>Sprite animation</h2> <p>Click on the <code>Player</code> node and add an <a href="../../classes/class_animatedsprite.html#class-animatedsprite"><span class="std std-ref">AnimatedSprite</span></a> node as a child. The <code>AnimatedSprite</code> will handle the appearance and animations for our player. Notice that there is a warning symbol next to the node. An <code>AnimatedSprite</code> requires a <a href="../../classes/class_spriteframes.html#class-spriteframes"><span class="std std-ref">SpriteFrames</span></a> resource, which is a list of the animations it can display. To create one, find the <code>Frames</code> property in the Inspector and click "[empty]" -&gt; "New SpriteFrames". Click again to open the "SpriteFrames" panel:</p> <img alt="../../_images/spriteframes_panel.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/_images/spriteframes_panel.png"> <p>On the left is a list of animations. Click the "default" one and rename it to "walk". Then click the "New Animation" button to create a second animation named "up". Find the player images in the "FileSystem" tab - they're in the <code>art</code> folder you unzipped earlier. Drag the two images for each animation, named <code>playerGrey_up[1/2]</code> and <code>playerGrey_walk[1/2]</code>, into the "Animation Frames" side of the panel for the corresponding animation:</p> <img alt="../../_images/spriteframes_panel2.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/_images/spriteframes_panel2.png"> <p>The player images are a bit too large for the game window, so we need to scale them down. Click on the <code>AnimatedSprite</code> node and set the <code>Scale</code> property to <code>(0.5, 0.5)</code>. You can find it in the Inspector under the <code>Node2D</code> heading.</p> <img alt="../../_images/player_scale.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/_images/player_scale.png"> <p>Finally, add a <a href="../../classes/class_collisionshape2d.html#class-collisionshape2d"><span class="std std-ref">CollisionShape2D</span></a> as a child of <code>Player</code>. This will determine the player's "hitbox", or the bounds of its collision area. For this character, a <code>CapsuleShape2D</code> node gives the best fit, so next to "Shape" in the Inspector, click "[empty]"" -&gt; "New CapsuleShape2D". Using the two size handles, resize the shape to cover the sprite:</p> <img alt="../../_images/player_coll_shape1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/_images/player_coll_shape1.png"> <p>When you're finished, your <code>Player</code> scene should look like this:</p> <img alt="../../_images/player_scene_nodes.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/_images/player_scene_nodes.png"> <p>Make sure to save the scene again after these changes.</p> <p>In the next part, we'll add a script to the player node to move and animate it. Then, we'll set up collision detection to know when the player got hit by something.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
