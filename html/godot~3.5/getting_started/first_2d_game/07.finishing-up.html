<h1 id="doc-your-first-2d-game-finishing-up">Finishing up</h1> <p>We have now completed all the functionality for our game. Below are some remaining steps to add a bit more "juice" to improve the game experience.</p> <p>Feel free to expand the gameplay with your own ideas.</p> <section id="background"> <h2>Background</h2> <p>The default gray background is not very appealing, so let's change its color. One way to do this is to use a <a href="../../classes/class_colorrect.html#class-colorrect"><span class="std std-ref">ColorRect</span></a> node. Make it the first node under <code>Main</code> so that it will be drawn behind the other nodes. <code>ColorRect</code> only has one property: <code>Color</code>. Choose a color you like and select "Layout" -&gt; "Full Rect" so that it covers the screen.</p> <p>You could also add a background image, if you have one, by using a <code>TextureRect</code> node instead.</p> </section> <section id="sound-effects"> <h2>Sound effects</h2> <p>Sound and music can be the single most effective way to add appeal to the game experience. In your game assets folder, you have two sound files: "House In a Forest Loop.ogg" for background music, and "gameover.wav" for when the player loses.</p> <p>Add two <a href="../../classes/class_audiostreamplayer.html#class-audiostreamplayer"><span class="std std-ref">AudioStreamPlayer</span></a> nodes as children of <code>Main</code>. Name one of them <code>Music</code> and the other <code>DeathSound</code>. On each one, click on the <code>Stream</code> property, select "Load", and choose the corresponding audio file.</p> <p>To play the music, add <code>$Music.play()</code> in the <code>new_game()</code> function and <code>$Music.stop()</code> in the <code>game_over()</code> function.</p> <p>Finally, add <code>$DeathSound.play()</code> in the <code>game_over()</code> function.</p> </section> <section id="keyboard-shortcut"> <h2>Keyboard shortcut</h2> <p>Since the game is played with keyboard controls, it would be convenient if we could also start the game by pressing a key on the keyboard. We can do this with the "Shortcut" property of the <code>Button</code> node.</p> <p>In a previous lesson, we created four input actions to move the character. We will create a similar input action to map to the start button.</p> <p>Select "Project" -&gt; "Project Settings" and then click on the "Input Map" tab. In the same way you created the movement input actions, create a new input action called <code>start_game</code> and add a key mapping for the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Enter</kbd> key.</p> <p>In the <code>HUD</code> scene, select the <code>StartButton</code> and find its <em>Shortcut</em> property in the Inspector. Select "New Shortcut" and click on the "Shortcut" item. A second <em>Shortcut</em> property will appear. Select "New InputEventAction" and click the new "InputEventAction". Finally, in the <em>Action</em> property, type the name <code>start_game</code>.</p> <img alt="../../_images/start_button_shortcut.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/_images/start_button_shortcut.png"> <p>Now when the start button appears, you can either click it or press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Enter</kbd> to start the game.</p> <p>And with that, you completed your first 2D game in Godot.</p> <img alt="../../_images/dodge_preview.gif" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/_images/dodge_preview.gif"> <p>You got to make a player-controlled character, enemies that spawn randomly around the game board, count the score, implement a game over and replay, user interface, sounds, and more. Congratulations!</p> <p>There's still much to learn, but you can take a moment to appreciate what you achieved.</p> <p>And when you're ready, you can move on to <a href="../first_3d_game/index.html#doc-your-first-3d-game"><span class="std std-ref">Your first 3D game</span></a> to learn to create a complete 3D game from scratch, in Godot.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
