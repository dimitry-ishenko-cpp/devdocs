extends EventListener</pre> <p>The listener interface for receiving <code>WindowEvents</code>, including <code>WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS</code> and <code>WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS</code> events. The class that is interested in processing a <code>WindowEvent</code> either implements this interface (and all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract <code>WindowAdapter</code> class (overriding only the methods of interest). The listener object created from that class is then registered with a <code>Window</code> using the <code>Window</code>'s <code>addWindowFocusListener</code> method. When the <code>Window</code>'s status changes by virtue of it being opened, closed, activated, deactivated, iconified, or deiconified, or by focus being transfered into or out of the <code>Window</code>, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and the <code>WindowEvent</code> is passed to it.</p> <dl> <dt>Since:</dt> <dd>1.4</dd> <dt>See Also:</dt> <dd>
