<h1>Directive components in ngAnimate</h1>   <table class="definition-table"> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="directive/nganimatechildren.html">ngAnimateChildren</a></td> <td>
<p>ngAnimateChildren allows you to specify that children of this element should animate even if any of the children's parents are currently animating. By default, when an element has an active <code>enter</code>, <code>leave</code>, or <code>move</code> (structural) animation, child elements that also have an active structural animation are not animated.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="directive/nganimateswap.html">ngAnimateSwap</a></td> <td>
<p>ngAnimateSwap is a animation-oriented directive that allows for the container to be removed and entered in whenever the associated expression changes. A common usecase for this directive is a rotating banner or slider component which contains one image being present at a time. When the active image changes then the old image will perform a <code>leave</code> animation and the new element will be inserted via an <code>enter</code> animation.</p> </td> </tr> </table><div class="_attribution">
