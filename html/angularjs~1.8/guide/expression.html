<p><strong>Context:</strong> JavaScript expressions are evaluated against the global <code>window</code>. In AngularJS, expressions are evaluated against a <a href="../api/ng/type/%24rootscope.scope.html"><code>scope</code></a> object.</p> </li> <li>
<p><strong>Forgiving:</strong> In JavaScript, trying to evaluate undefined properties generates <code>ReferenceError</code> or <code>TypeError</code>. In AngularJS, expression evaluation is forgiving to <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p><strong>Filters:</strong> You can use <a href="filter.html">filters</a> within expressions to format data before displaying it.</p> </li> <li>
<p><strong>No Control Flow Statements:</strong> You cannot use the following in an AngularJS expression: conditionals, loops, or exceptions.</p> </li> <li>
<p><strong>No Function Declarations:</strong> You cannot declare functions in an AngularJS expression, even inside <code>ng-init</code> directive.</p> </li> <li>
<p><strong>No RegExp Creation With Literal Notation:</strong> You cannot create regular expressions in an AngularJS expression. An exception to this rule is <a href="../api/ng/directive/ngpattern.html"><code>ng-pattern</code></a> which accepts valid RegExp.</p> </li> <li>
<p><strong>No Object Creation With New Operator:</strong> You cannot use <code>new</code> operator in an AngularJS expression.</p> </li> <li>
<p><strong>No Bitwise, Comma, And Void Operators:</strong> You cannot use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators">Bitwise</a>, <code>,</code> or <code>void</code> operators in an AngularJS expression.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to run more complex JavaScript code, you should make it a controller method and call the method from your view. If you want to <code>eval()</code> an AngularJS expression yourself, use the <a href="../api/ng/type/%24rootscope.scope.html#%24eval.html"><code>$eval()</code></a> method.</p>   <p>You can try evaluating different expressions here:</p>  <h2 id="context">Context</h2> <p>AngularJS does not use JavaScript's <code>eval()</code> to evaluate expressions. Instead AngularJS's <a href="../api/ng/service/%24parse.html">$parse</a> service processes these expressions.</p> <p>AngularJS expressions do not have direct access to global variables like <code>window</code>, <code>document</code> or <code>location</code>. This restriction is intentional. It prevents accidental access to the global state â€“ a common source of subtle bugs.</p> <p>Instead use services like <code>$window</code> and <code>$location</code> in functions on controllers, which are then called from expressions. Such services provide mockable access to globals.</p> <p>It is possible to access the context object using the identifier <code>this</code> and the locals object using the identifier <code>$locals</code>.</p>  <h2 id="forgiving">Forgiving</h2> <p>Expression evaluation is forgiving to undefined and null. In JavaScript, evaluating <code>a.b.c</code> throws an exception if <code>a</code> is not an object. While this makes sense for a general purpose language, the expression evaluations are primarily used for data binding, which often look like this:</p> <pre>{{a.b.c}}
</pre> <p>It makes more sense to show nothing than to throw an exception if <code>a</code> is undefined (perhaps we are waiting for the server response, and it will become defined soon). If expression evaluation wasn't forgiving we'd have to write bindings that clutter the code, for example: <code>{{((a||{}).b||{}).c}}</code></p> <p>Similarly, invoking a function <code>a.b.c()</code> on <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code> simply returns <code>undefined</code>.</p> <h2 id="no-control-flow-statements">No Control Flow Statements</h2> <p>Apart from the ternary operator (<code>a ? b : c</code>), you cannot write a control flow statement in an expression. The reason behind this is core to the AngularJS philosophy that application logic should be in controllers, not the views. If you need a real conditional, loop, or to throw from a view expression, delegate to a JavaScript method instead.</p> <h2 id="no-function-declarations-or-regexp-creation-with-literal-notation">No function declarations or RegExp creation with literal notation</h2> <p>You can't declare functions or create regular expressions from within AngularJS expressions. This is to avoid complex model transformation logic inside templates. Such logic is better placed in a controller or in a dedicated filter where it can be tested properly.</p> <h2 id="-event-">$event</h2> <p>Directives like <a href="../api/ng/directive/ngclick.html"><code>ngClick</code></a> and <a href="../api/ng/directive/ngfocus.html"><code>ngFocus</code></a> expose a <code>$event</code> object within the scope of that expression. The object is an instance of a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/">jQuery Event Object</a> when jQuery is present or a similar jqLite object.</p>  <p>Note in the example above how we can pass in <code>$event</code> to <code>clickMe</code>, but how it does not show up in <code>{{$event}}</code>. This is because <code>$event</code> is outside the scope of that binding.</p> <h2 id="one-time-binding">One-time binding</h2> <p>An expression that starts with <code>::</code> is considered a one-time expression. One-time expressions will stop recalculating once they are stable, which happens after the first digest if the expression result is a non-undefined value (see value stabilization algorithm below).</p>  <h3 id="reasons-for-using-one-time-binding">Reasons for using one-time binding</h3> <p>The main purpose of one-time binding expression is to provide a way to create a binding that gets deregistered and frees up resources once the binding is stabilized. Reducing the number of expressions being watched makes the digest loop faster and allows more information to be displayed at the same time.</p> <h3 id="value-stabilization-algorithm">Value stabilization algorithm</h3> <p>One-time binding expressions will retain the value of the expression at the end of the digest cycle as long as that value is not undefined. If the value of the expression is set within the digest loop and later, within the same digest loop, it is set to undefined, then the expression is not fulfilled and will remain watched.</p> <ol> <li>Given an expression that starts with <code>::</code>, when a digest loop is entered and expression is dirty-checked, store the value as V</li> <li>If V is not undefined, mark the result of the expression as stable and schedule a task to deregister the watch for this expression when we exit the digest loop</li> <li>Process the digest loop as normal</li> <li>When digest loop is done and all the values have settled, process the queue of watch deregistration tasks. For each watch to be deregistered, check if it still evaluates to a value that is not <code>undefined</code>. If that's the case, deregister the watch. Otherwise, keep dirty-checking the watch in the future digest loops by following the same algorithm starting from step 1</li> </ol> <h4 id="special-case-for-object-literals">Special case for object literals</h4> <p>Unlike simple values, object-literals are watched until every key is defined. See <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2760-one-time-data-bindings-for-object-literal-expressions-in-angularjs-1-3.htm">http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2760-one-time-data-bindings-for-object-literal-expressions-in-angularjs-1-3.htm</a></p> <h3 id="how-to-benefit-from-one-time-binding">How to benefit from one-time binding</h3> <p>If the expression will not change once set, it is a candidate for one-time binding. Here are three example cases.</p> <p>When interpolating text or attributes:</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;div name="attr: {{::color}}"&gt;text: {{::name | uppercase}}&lt;/div&gt;
</pre> <p>When using a directive with bidirectional binding and parameters that will not change:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">someModule.directive('someDirective', function() {
  return {
    scope: {
      name: '=',
      color: '@'
    },
    template: '{{name}}: {{color}}'
  };
});
</pre> <pre data-language="html">&lt;div some-directive name="::myName" color="My color is {{::myColor}}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre> <p>When using a directive that takes an expression:</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li ng-repeat="item in ::items | orderBy:'name'"&gt;{{item.name}};&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
