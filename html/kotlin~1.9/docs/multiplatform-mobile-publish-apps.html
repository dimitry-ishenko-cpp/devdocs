<h1 data-toc="multiplatform-mobile-publish-apps" id="multiplatform-mobile-publish-apps.md">Publish your application</h1>
<p id="50af862c">Once your mobile apps are ready for release, it's time to deliver them to the users by publishing them in app stores. Multiple stores are available for each platform. However, in this article we'll focus on the official ones: <a href="https://play.google.com/store" id="eb40b368" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/" id="4c554c8f" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple App Store</a>. You'll learn how to prepare Kotlin Multiplatform applications for publishing, and we'll highlight the parts of this process that deserve special attention.</p>
<section class="chapter"><h2 id="android-app" data-toc="android-app">Android app</h2>
<p id="f078b076">Since <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin" id="e377c543" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotlin is the main language for Android development</a>, Kotlin Multiplatform has no obvious effect on compiling the project and building the Android app. Both the Android library produced from the shared module and the Android app itself are typical Android Gradle modules; they are no different from other Android libraries and apps. Thus, publishing the Android app from a Kotlin Multiplatform project is no different from the usual process described in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/publish" id="ffadfe69" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android developer documentation</a>.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="ios-app" data-toc="ios-app">iOS app</h2>
<p id="ac44fba">The iOS app from a Kotlin Multiplatform project is built from a typical Xcode project, so the main stages involved in publishing it are the same as described in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/" id="9b3b0a3" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS developer documentation</a>.</p>
<p id="2a65f5f9">What is specific to Kotlin Multiplatform projects is compiling the shared Kotlin module into a framework and linking it to the Xcode project. Generally, all integration between the shared module and the Xcode project is done automatically by the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile" id="8f7250be" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin for Android Studio</a>. However, if you don't use the plugin, bear in mind the following when building and bundling the iOS project in Xcode:</p>
<ul class="list _bullet" id="3869fcfd">
<li class="list__item" id="fa1d7445"><p>The shared Kotlin library compiles down to the native framework.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="f71ef76b"><p>You need to connect the framework compiled for the specific platform to the iOS app project.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="b6d394f2"><p>In the Xcode project settings, specify the path to the framework to search for the build system.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="90aa7580"><p>After building the project, you should launch and test the app to make sure that there are no issues when working with the framework in runtime.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="724c102c">There are two ways you can connect the shared Kotlin module to the iOS project:</p>
<ul class="list _bullet" id="99896b5b">
<li class="list__item" id="45bbf3d7"><p>Use the <a href="native-cocoapods.html" id="cd52f1a">Kotlin/Native CocoaPods plugin</a>, which allows you to use a multiplatform project with native targets as a CocoaPods dependency in your iOS project.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="181a01b2"><p>Manually configure your Multiplatform project to create an iOS framework and the Xcode project to obtain its latest version. The Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin for Android Studio usually does this configuration. <a href="multiplatform-mobile-understand-project-structure.html#ios-application" id="a7789258">Understand the project structure</a> to implement it yourself.</p></li>
</ul>
<section class="chapter"><h3 id="symbolicating-crash-reports" data-toc="symbolicating-crash-reports">Symbolicating crash reports</h3>
<p id="6e71e7dd">To help developers make their apps better, iOS provides a means for analyzing app crashes. For detailed crash analysis, it uses special debug symbol (<code class="code ">.dSYM</code>) files that match memory addresses in crash reports with locations in the source code, such as functions or line numbers.</p>
<p id="b0676433">By default, the release versions of iOS frameworks produced from the shared Kotlin module have an accompanying <code class="code ">.dSYM</code> file. This helps you analyze crashes that happen in the shared module's code.</p>
<p id="d6db1a6">When an iOS app is rebuilt from bitcode, its <code class="code ">dSYM</code> file becomes invalid. For such cases, you can compile the shared module to a static framework that stores the debug information inside itself. For instructions on setting up crash report symbolication in binaries produced from Kotlin modules, see the <a href="native-ios-symbolication.html" id="b3b489bc">Kotlin/Native documentation</a>.</p></section></section><div class="last-modified"> Last modified: 11 April 2023</div>
