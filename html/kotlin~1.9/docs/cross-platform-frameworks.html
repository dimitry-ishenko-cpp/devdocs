<p id="3eebf107">Mobile engineers use cross-platform mobile development frameworks to build native-looking applications for multiple platforms, such as Android and iOS, using a single codebase. Shareable code is one of the key advantages this approach has over native app development. Having one single codebase means that mobile engineers can save time by avoiding the need to write code for each operating system, accelerating the development process.</p>
<p id="2ddaa4b7">With demand for cross-platform solutions for mobile app development growing, the number of tools available on the market is increasing as well. In the following section, we provide an overview of the most widely used frameworks for building cross-platform mobile apps for iOS, Android, and other platforms. Our summaries include the programming languages these frameworks are based on, as well as their main features and advantages.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="popular-cross-platform-app-development-frameworks" data-toc="popular-cross-platform-app-development-frameworks">Popular cross-platform app development frameworks</h2>
