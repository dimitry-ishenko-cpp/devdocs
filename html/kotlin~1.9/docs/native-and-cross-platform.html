<p id="dead3023">People spend much of their waking time on their mobile devices. They also <a href="https://www.data.ai/en/insights/market-data/state-of-mobile-2022/" id="96c3f03c" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">spend 4.8 hours per day on mobile applications</a>, which makes them attractive to all kinds of businesses.</p>
<p id="6fe10e1b">Mobile app development is constantly evolving, with new technologies and frameworks emerging every year. With various solutions on the market, it's often difficult to choose between them. You might have heard about the long-standing "native versus cross-platform" debate.</p>
<p id="2dcefa7d">There are many factors to consider before building an app, such as development cost, time, and app functionality. This is especially true if you want to target both Android and iOS audiences. It may be challenging to decide which mobile development approach will be the best for your particular project. To help you choose between native and cross-platform app development, we've created a list of six essential things to keep in mind.</p>
<section class="chapter"><h2 id="what-is-native-mobile-app-development" data-toc="what-is-native-mobile-app-development">What is native mobile app development?</h2>
<p id="b2712f7">Native mobile development means that you build an app for a particular mobile operating system – in most cases Android or iOS. While working on native applications, developers use specific programming languages and tools. For example, you can create a native Android application with Kotlin or Java, or build an app for iOS with Objective-C or Swift.</p>

<p id="2e788dac">Cross-platform app development, also called multiplatform development, is the process of building mobile apps that are compatible with several operating systems. Instead of creating separate applications for iOS and Android, mobile engineers can share some or all of the source code between multiple platforms. This way, the applications will work the same on both iOS and Android.</p>
<p id="7d94b48d">There are various open-source frameworks for <a href="cross-platform-mobile-development.html" id="83f80817">cross-platform mobile app development</a> available today. Some of the most popular are Flutter, React Native, and Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile. Below are some of the key pros and cons.</p>

<p id="efdf4e51">Multiplatform technology is constantly evolving. Some cross-platform development frameworks like <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/lp/multiplatform/" id="4a6eca2b" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile</a> provide the benefits of building both cross-platform and native apps and remove the limitations that are commonly associated with the approach.</p>

<p id="ff98ce88">Poor performance was long considered to be one of the main disadvantages of multiplatform applications. However, the performance and quality of your product largely depend on the tools you use to build the app. The latest cross-platform frameworks provide all the tools necessary to develop apps with a native-like user experience.</p>
<p id="8b5ec998">By using different compiler backends, <a href="multiplatform.html#code-sharing-between-platforms" id="e5cb94c1">Kotlin</a> is compiled to platform formats – JVM bytecode for Android and native binaries for iOS. As a result, the performance of your shared code is the same as if you write them natively.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="2-cross-platform-frameworks-are-unsafe" data-toc="2-cross-platform-frameworks-are-unsafe">2. Cross-platform frameworks are unsafe.</h4>
<p id="ff5b722d">There's a common misconception that native apps are much more secure and reliable. However, modern cross-platform development tools allow developers to build safe apps that guarantee reliable data protection. Mobile engineers just need to <a href="https://appstronauts.co/blog/are-cross-platform-apps-as-fast-and-secure-as-native-apps/#:~:text=Unsecurity%20of%20cross%2Dplatform%20apps,a%20cross%2Dplatform%20app%27s%20code." id="21e7c0b" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">take additional measures to make their apps secure</a>.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="3-cross-platform-apps-don-t-have-access-to-all-native-functions-of-mobile-devices" data-toc="3-cross-platform-apps-don-t-have-access-to-all-native-functions-of-mobile-devices">3. Cross-platform apps don't have access to all native functions of mobile devices.</h4>
<p id="68083a22">It is true that not all cross-platform frameworks allow you to build apps with full access to the device's features. Nevertheless, some modern multiplatform frameworks can help you overcome this challenge. For example, Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile gives easy access to Android and iOS SDKs. It provides a <a href="multiplatform-connect-to-apis.html" id="7f2b9e88">Kotlin mechanism of expected and actual declarations</a> to help you access the device's capabilities and features.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="4-it-can-often-be-difficult-to-manage-cross-platform-projects" data-toc="4-it-can-often-be-difficult-to-manage-cross-platform-projects">4.

<p id="1878cd2d">In fact, it's the opposite. Cross-platform solutions help you more effectively manage resources. Your development teams can learn how to write and reuse shared code.

<p id="a9e8315a">Now, let's take a look at important factors you need to consider when choosing between native and cross-platform solutions for mobile app development.</p>
<section class="chapter"><h3 id="1-the-type-and-purpose-of-your-future-app" data-toc="1-the-type-and-purpose-of-your-future-app">1. The type and purpose of your future app</h3>
<p id="5b4721a4">One of the first steps is understanding what app you will be building, including its features and purpose. A complex application with many features will require a lot of programming, especially if it's something new that doesn't have any existing templates.</p>
<p id="c1a10690">How crucial is the user interface of your app? Are you looking for outstanding visuals or is the UI less important? Will it require any specific hardware functionality and access to camera and GPS location support? You need to make sure the mobile development approach you choose provides the necessary tools to build the app you need and provide a great user experience.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="2-your-team-s-experience-in-programming-languages-and-tools" data-toc="2-your-team-s-experience-in-programming-languages-and-tools">2. Your team's experience in programming languages and tools</h3>
<p id="28518859">The developers on your team should have enough experience and expertise to work with particular frameworks. Pay close attention to what programming skills and languages the development tools require.</p>
<p id="2e4b05d3">For example, developers need to know Objective-C or Swift to create native apps for iOS, and they need to know Kotlin or Java for Android. The cross-platform framework Flutter requires knowledge of Dart. If you use Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, Kotlin syntax is easy for iOS developers to learn because it follows concepts similar to Swift.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="3-long-term-viability" data-toc="3-long-term-viability">3. Long-term viability</h3>
<p id="2f89cc59">When choosing between different approaches and frameworks, you need to be confident that the platform vendor will continue supporting it over the long term. You can dig into the details about the provider, the size of their community, and adoption by global companies. For example, Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile was developed by JetBrains, Flutter by Google, and React Native by Facebook.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="4-development-cost-and-your-budget" data-toc="4-development-cost-and-your-budget">4.
