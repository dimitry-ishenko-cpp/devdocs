<p>Phoenix Presence is a feature which allows you to register process information on a topic and replicate it transparently across a cluster. It's a combination of both a server-side and client-side library, which makes it simple to implement. A simple use-case would be showing which users are currently online in an application.</p>
<p>Phoenix Presence is special for a number of reasons. It has no single point of failure, no single source of truth, relies entirely on the standard library with no operational dependencies and self-heals.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up" class="section-heading">  Setting up </h2> <p>We are going to use Presence to track which users are connected on the server and send updates to the client as users join and leave. We will deliver those updates via Phoenix Channels. Therefore, let's create a <code class="inline">RoomChannel</code>, as we did in the channels guides:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">$ mix phx.gen.channel Room
</pre>
<p>Follow the steps after the generator and you are ready to start tracking presence.</p>
<h2 id="the-presence-generator" class="section-heading">  The Presence generator </h2> <p>To get started with Presence, we'll first need to generate a presence module. We can do this with the <a href="mix.tasks.phx.gen.presence.html"><code class="inline">mix phx.gen.presence</code></a> task:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">$ mix phx.gen.presence
* creating lib/hello_web/channels/presence.ex

Add your new module to your supervision tree,
in lib/hello/application.ex:

    children = [
      ...
      HelloWeb.Presence,
    ]

You're all set! See the Phoenix.Presence docs for more details:
https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html
</pre>
<p>If we open up the <code class="inline">lib/hello_web/channels/presence.ex</code> file, we will see the following line:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">use Phoenix.Presence,
  otp_app: :hello,
  pubsub_server: Hello.PubSub</pre>
<p>This sets up the module for presence, defining the functions we require for tracking presences. As mentioned in the generator task, we should add this module to our supervision tree in <code class="inline">application.ex</code>:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">children = [
  ...
  HelloWeb.Presence,
]</pre>
<p>Next, we will create the channel that we'll communicate presence over. After a user joins, we can push the list of presences down the channel and then track the connection. We can also provide a map of additional information to track.</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">defmodule HelloWeb.RoomChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel
  alias HelloWeb.Presence

  def join("room:lobby", %{"name" =&gt; name}, socket) do
    send(self(), :after_join)
    {:ok, assign(socket, :name, name)}
  end

  def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do
    {:ok, _} =
      Presence.track(socket, socket.assigns.name, %{
        online_at: inspect(System.system_time(:second))
      })

    push(socket, "presence_state", Presence.list(socket))
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end</pre>
<p>Finally, we can use the client-side Presence library included in <code class="inline">phoenix.js</code> to manage the state and presence diffs that come down the socket. It listens for the <code class="inline">"presence_state"</code> and <code class="inline">"presence_diff"</code> events and provides a simple callback for you to handle the events as they happen, with the <code class="inline">onSync</code> callback.</p>
<p>The <code class="inline">onSync</code> callback allows you to easily react to presence state changes, which most often results in re-rendering an updated list of active users. You can use the <code class="inline">list</code> method to format and return each individual presence based on the needs of your application.</p>
<p>To iterate users, we use the <code class="inline">presences.list()</code> function which accepts a callback. The callback will be called for each presence item with 2 arguments, the presence id and a list of metas (one for each presence for that presence id). We use this to display the users and the number of devices they are online with.</p>
<p>We can see presence working by adding the following to <code class="inline">assets/js/app.js</code>:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">import {Socket, Presence} from "phoenix"

let socket = new Socket("/socket", {params: {token: window.userToken}})
let channel = socket.channel("room:lobby", {name: window.location.search.split("=")[1])
let presence = new Presence(channel)

function renderOnlineUsers(presence) {
  let response = ""

  presence.list((id, {metas: [first, ...rest]}) =&gt; {
    let count = rest.length + 1
    response += `&lt;br&gt;${id} (count: ${count})&lt;/br&gt;`
  })

  document.querySelector("main[role=main]").innerHTML = response
}

socket.connect()

presence.onSync(() =&gt; renderOnlineUsers(presence))

channel.join()</pre>
<p>We can ensure this is working by opening 3 browser tabs. If we navigate to <a href="http://localhost:4000/?name=Alice">http://localhost:4000/?name=Alice</a> on two browser tabs and <a href="http://localhost:4000/?name=Bob">http://localhost:4000/?name=Bob</a> then we should see:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">Alice (count: 2)
Bob (count: 1)</pre>
<p>If we close one of the Alice tabs, then the count should decrease to 1. If we close another tab, the user should disappear from the list entirely.</p>
<h2 id="making-it-safe" class="section-heading">  Making it safe </h2> <p>In our initial implementation, we are passing the name of the user as part of the URL. However, in many systems, you want to allow only logged in users to access the presence functionality. To do so, you should set up token authentication, <a href="channels.html#using-token-authentication">as detailed in the token authentication section of the channels guide</a>.</p>
<p>With token authentication, you should access <code class="inline">socket.assigns.user_id</code>, set in <code class="inline">UserSocket</code>, instead of <code class="inline">socket.assigns.name</code> set from parameters.</p> <div class="bottom-actions"> <div class="bottom-actions-item"> <a href="channels.html" class="bottom-actions-button" rel="prev"> <span class="subheader"> ← Previous Page </span> <span class="title"> Channels </span> </a> </div> <div class="bottom-actions-item"> <a href="testing.html" class="bottom-actions-button" rel="next"> <span class="subheader"> Next Page → </span> <span class="title"> Introduction to Testing </span> </a> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
