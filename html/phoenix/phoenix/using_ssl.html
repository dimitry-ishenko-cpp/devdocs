<h1>   <span>Using SSL</span> </h1> <p>To prepare an application to serve requests over SSL, we need to add a little bit of configuration and two environment variables. In order for SSL to actually work, we'll need a key file and certificate file from a certificate authority. The environment variables that we'll need are paths to those two files.</p>
<p>The configuration consists of a new <code class="inline">https:</code> key for our endpoint whose value is a keyword list of port, path to the key file, and path to the cert (PEM) file. If we add the <code class="inline">otp_app:</code> key whose value is the name of our application, Plug will begin to look for them at the root of our application. We can then put those files in our <code class="inline">priv</code> directory and set the paths to <code class="inline">priv/our_keyfile.key</code> and <code class="inline">priv/our_cert.crt</code>.</p>
<p>Here's an example configuration from <code class="inline">config/prod.exs</code>.</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">import Config

config :hello, HelloWeb.Endpoint,
  http: [port: {:system, "PORT"}],
  url: [host: "example.com"],
  cache_static_manifest: "priv/static/cache_manifest.json",
  https: [
    port: 443,
    cipher_suite: :strong,
    otp_app: :hello,
    keyfile: System.get_env("SOME_APP_SSL_KEY_PATH"),
    certfile: System.get_env("SOME_APP_SSL_CERT_PATH"),
    # OPTIONAL Key for intermediate certificates:
    cacertfile: System.get_env("INTERMEDIATE_CERTFILE_PATH")
  ]
</pre>
<p>Without the <code class="inline">otp_app:</code> key, we need to provide absolute paths to the files wherever they are on the filesystem in order for Plug to find them.</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">Path.expand("../../../some/path/to/ssl/key.pem", __DIR__)</pre>
<p>The options under the <code class="inline">https:</code> key are passed to the Plug adapter, typically <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/plug_cowboy/2.5.2/Plug.Cowboy.html"><code class="inline">Plug.Cowboy</code></a>, which in turn uses <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/plug/1.13.6/Plug.SSL.html"><code class="inline">Plug.SSL</code></a> to select the TLS socket options. Please refer to the documentation for <a href="../plug/plug.ssl.html#configure/1">Plug.SSL.configure/1</a> for more information on the available options and their defaults. The <a href="../plug/https.html">Plug HTTPS Guide</a> and the <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/ssl.html">Erlang/OTP ssl</a> documentation also provide valuable information.</p>
<h2 id="ssl-in-development" class="section-heading">  SSL in Development </h2> <p>If you would like to use HTTPS in development, a self-signed certificate can be generated by running: <a href="mix.tasks.phx.gen.cert.html"><code class="inline">mix phx.gen.cert</code></a>. This requires Erlang/OTP 20 or later.</p>
<p>With your self-signed certificate, your development configuration in <code class="inline">config/dev.exs</code> can be updated to run an HTTPS endpoint:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">config :my_app, MyAppWeb.Endpoint,
  ...
  https: [
    port: 4001,
    cipher_suite: :strong,
    keyfile: "priv/cert/selfsigned_key.pem",
    certfile: "priv/cert/selfsigned.pem"
  ]</pre>
<p>This can replace your <code class="inline">http</code> configuration, or you can run HTTP and HTTPS servers on different ports.</p>
<h2 id="force-ssl" class="section-heading">  Force SSL </h2> <p>In many cases, you'll want to force all incoming requests to use SSL by redirecting HTTP to HTTPS. This can be accomplished by setting the <code class="inline">:force_ssl</code> option in your endpoint configuration. It expects a list of options which are forwarded to <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/plug/1.13.6/Plug.SSL.html"><code class="inline">Plug.SSL</code></a>. By default, it sets the "strict-transport-security" header in HTTPS requests, forcing browsers to always use HTTPS. If an unsafe (HTTP) request is sent, it redirects to the HTTPS version using the <code class="inline">:host</code> specified in the <code class="inline">:url</code> configuration. For example:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">config :my_app, MyAppWeb.Endpoint,
  force_ssl: [rewrite_on: [:x_forwarded_proto]]</pre>
<p>To dynamically redirect to the <code class="inline">host</code> of the current request, set <code class="inline">:host</code> in the <code class="inline">:force_ssl</code> configuration to <code class="inline">nil</code>.</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">config :my_app, MyAppWeb.Endpoint,
  force_ssl: [rewrite_on: [:x_forwarded_proto], host: nil]</pre>
<p>In these examples, the <code class="inline">rewrite_on:</code> key specifies the HTTP header used by a reverse proxy or load balancer in front of the application to indicate whether the request was received over HTTP or HTTPS. For more information on the implications of offloading TLS to an external element, in particular relating to secure cookies, refer to the <a href="../plug/https.html#offloading-tls">Plug HTTPS Guide</a>. Keep in mind that the options passed to <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/plug/1.13.6/Plug.SSL.html"><code class="inline">Plug.SSL</code></a> in that document should be set using the <code class="inline">force_ssl:</code> endpoint option in a Phoenix application.</p>
<h2 id="hsts" class="section-heading">  HSTS </h2> <p>HSTS or "strict-transport-security" is a mechanism that allows a website to declare itself as only accessible via a secure connection (HTTPS). It was introduced to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that strip SSL/TLS. It causes web browsers to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS and refuse to connect unless the connection uses SSL/TLS.</p>
<p>With <code class="inline">force_ssl: [hsts: true]</code> set, the <code class="inline">Strict-Transport-Security</code> header is set with a max age that defines the length of time the policy is valid for. Modern web browsers will respond to this by redirecting from HTTP to HTTPS for the standard case but it does have other consequences. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797">RFC6797</a> which defines HSTS also specifies <strong>that the browser should keep track of the policy of a host and apply it until it expires.</strong> It also specifies that <strong>traffic on any port other than 80 is assumed to be encrypted</strong> as per the policy.</p>
<p>This can result in unexpected behaviour if you access your application on localhost, for example <code class="inline">https://localhost:4000</code>, as from that point forward any traffic coming from localhost will be expected to be encrypted, except port 80 which will be redirected to port 443. This has the potential to disrupt traffic to any other local servers or proxies that you may be running on your computer. Other applications or proxies on localhost will refuse to work unless the traffic is encrypted.</p>
<p>If you do inadvertently turn on HSTS for localhost, you may need to reset the cache on your browser before it will accept any HTTP traffic from localhost. For Chrome, you need to <code class="inline">Empty Cache and Hard Reload</code> which is available from the reload menu that appears when you click and hold the reload icon from the Developer Tools Panel. For Safari, you will need to clear your cache, remove the entry from <code class="inline">~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist</code> (or delete that file entirely) and restart Safari. Alternately, you can set the <code class="inline">:expires</code> option on <code class="inline">force_ssl</code> to <code class="inline">0</code> which should expired the entry to turn off HSTS. More information on the options for HSTS are available at <a href="../plug/plug.ssl.html">Plug.SSL</a>.</p> <div class="bottom-actions"> <div class="bottom-actions-item"> <a href="custom_error_pages.html" class="bottom-actions-button" rel="prev"> <span class="subheader"> ‚Üê Previous Page </span> <span class="title"> Custom Error Pages </span> </a> </div>  </div><div class="_attribution">
