<h1>   <span>Deploying with Releases</span> </h1> <h2 id="what-we-ll-need" class="section-heading">  What we'll need </h2> <p>The only thing we'll need for this guide is a working Phoenix application. For those of us who need a simple application to deploy, please follow the <a href="up_and_running.html">Up and Running guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="goals" class="section-heading">  Goals </h2> <p>Our main goal for this guide is to package your Phoenix application into a self-contained directory that includes the Erlang VM, Elixir, all of your code and dependencies. This package can then be dropped into a production machine.</p>
<h2 id="releases-assemble" class="section-heading">  Releases, assemble! </h2> <p>To assemble a release, you will need at least Elixir v1.9, however this guide assumes you are using Elixir v1.12 or later to take advantage of latest releases improvements:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">$ elixir -v
1.12.0
</pre>
<p>If you are not familiar with Elixir releases yet, we recommend you to read <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html">Elixir's excellent docs</a> before continuing.</p>
<p>Once that is done, you can assemble a release by going through all of the steps in our general <a href="deployment.html">deployment guide</a> with <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html"><code class="inline">mix release</code></a> at the end. Let's recap.</p>
<p>First set the environment variables:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">$ mix phx.gen.secret
REALLY_LONG_SECRET
$ export SECRET_KEY_BASE=REALLY_LONG_SECRET
$ export DATABASE_URL=ecto://USER:PASS@HOST/database
</pre>
<p>Then load dependencies to compile code and assets:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir"># Initial setup
$ mix deps.get --only prod
$ MIX_ENV=prod mix compile

# Compile assets
$ MIX_ENV=prod mix assets.deploy
</pre>
<p>And now run <a href="mix.tasks.phx.gen.release.html"><code class="inline">mix phx.gen.release</code></a>:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">$ mix phx.gen.release
==&gt; my_app
* creating rel/overlays/bin/server
* creating rel/overlays/bin/server.bat
* creating rel/overlays/bin/migrate
* creating rel/overlays/bin/migrate.bat
* creating lib/my_app/release.ex

Your application is ready to be deployed in a release!

    # To start your system
    _build/dev/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start

    # To start your system with the Phoenix server running
    _build/dev/rel/my_app/bin/server

    # To run migrations
    _build/dev/rel/my_app/bin/migrate

Once the release is running:

    # To connect to it remotely
    _build/dev/rel/my_app/bin/my_app remote

    # To stop it gracefully (you may also send SIGINT/SIGTERM)
    _build/dev/rel/my_app/bin/my_app stop

To list all commands:

    _build/dev/rel/my_app/bin/my_app

</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline">phx.gen.release</code> task generated a few files for us to assist in releases. First, it created <code class="inline">server</code> and <code class="inline">migrate</code> <em>overlay</em> scripts for conveniently running the phoenix server inside a release or invoking migrations from a release. The files in the <code class="inline">rel/overlays</code> directory are copied into every release environment. Next, it generated a <code class="inline">release.ex</code> file which is used to invoked Ecto migrations without a dependency on <code class="inline">mix</code> itself.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: If you are a docker user, you can pass the <code class="inline">--docker</code> flag to <a href="mix.tasks.phx.gen.release.html"><code class="inline">mix phx.gen.release</code></a> to generate a Dockerfile ready for deployment.</p>
<p>Next, we can invoke <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html"><code class="inline">mix release</code></a> to build the release:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">$ MIX_ENV=prod mix release
Generated my_app app
* assembling my_app-0.1.0 on MIX_ENV=prod
* using config/runtime.exs to configure the release at runtime

Release created at _build/prod/rel/my_app!

    # To start your system
    _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start

...
</pre>
<p>You can start the release by calling <code class="inline">_build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start</code>, or boot your webserver by calling <code class="inline">_build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/server</code>, where you have to replace <code class="inline">my_app</code> by your current application name.</p>
<p>Now you can get all of the files under the <code class="inline">_build/prod/rel/my_app</code> directory, package it, and run it in any production machine with the same OS and architecture as the one that assembled the release. For more details, check the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html">docs for <code class="inline">mix release</code></a>.</p>
<p>But before we finish this guide, there is one more feature from releases that most Phoenix application will use, so let's talk about that.</p>
<h2 id="ecto-migrations-and-custom-commands" class="section-heading">  Ecto migrations and custom commands </h2> <p>A common need in production systems is to execute custom commands required to set up the production environment. One of such commands is precisely migrating the database. Since we don't have <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html"><code class="inline">Mix</code></a>, a <em>build</em> tool, inside releases, which are a production artifact, we need to bring said commands directly into the release.</p>
<p>The <code class="inline">phx.gen.release</code> command created the following <code class="inline">release.ex</code> file in your project <code class="inline">lib/my_app/release.ex</code>, with the following content:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">defmodule MyApp.Release do
  @app :my_app

  def migrate do
    load_app()

    for repo &lt;- repos() do
      {:ok, _, _} = Ecto.Migrator.with_repo(repo, &amp;Ecto.Migrator.run(&amp;1, :up, all: true))
    end
  end

  def rollback(repo, version) do
    load_app()
    {:ok, _, _} = Ecto.Migrator.with_repo(repo, &amp;Ecto.Migrator.run(&amp;1, :down, to: version))
  end

  defp repos do
    Application.fetch_env!(@app, :ecto_repos)
  end

  defp load_app do
    Application.load(@app)
  end
end</pre>
<p>Where you replace the first two lines by your application names.</p>
<p>Now you can assemble a new release with <code class="inline">MIX_ENV=prod mix release</code> and you can invoke any code, including the functions in the module above, by calling the <code class="inline">eval</code> command:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">$ _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app eval "MyApp.Release.migrate"
</pre>
<p>And that's it! If you peek inside the <code class="inline">migrate</code> script, you'll see it wraps exactly this invocation.</p>
<p>You can use this approach to create any custom command to run in production. In this case, we used <code class="inline">load_app</code>, which calls <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html#load/1"><code class="inline">Application.load/1</code></a> to load the current application without starting it. However, you may want to write a custom command that starts the whole application. In such cases, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html#ensure_all_started/1"><code class="inline">Application.ensure_all_started/1</code></a> must be used. Keep in mind, starting the application will start all processes for the current application, including the Phoenix endpoint. This can be circumvented by changing your supervision tree to not start certain children under certain conditions. For example, in the release commands file you could do:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">defp start_app do
  load_app()
  Application.put_env(@app, :minimal, true)
  Application.ensure_all_started(@app)
end</pre>
<p>And then in your application you check <code class="inline">Application.get_env(@app, :minimal)</code> and start only part of the children when it is set.</p>
<h2 id="containers" class="section-heading">  Containers </h2> <p>Elixir releases work well with container technologies, such as Docker. The idea is that you assemble the release inside the Docker container and then build an image based on the release artifacts.</p>
<p>If you call <code class="inline">mix phx.gen.release --docker</code> you'll see a new file with these contents:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir"># Find eligible builder and runner images on Docker Hub. We use Ubuntu/Debian instead of
# Alpine to avoid DNS resolution issues in production.

CMD /app/bin/server</pre>
<p>Where <code class="inline">my_app</code> is the name of your app. At the end, you will have an application in <code class="inline">/app</code> ready to run as <code class="inline">/app/bin/server</code>.</p>
<p>A few points about configuring a containerized application:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you run your app in a container, the <code class="inline">Endpoint</code> needs to be configured to listen on a "public" <code class="inline">:ip</code> address (like <code class="inline">0.0.0.0</code>) so that the app can be reached from outside the container. Whether the host should publish the container's ports to its own public IP or to localhost depends on your needs.</li>
<li>The more configuration you can provide at runtime (using <code class="inline">config/runtime.exs</code>), the more reusable your images will be across environments. In particular, secrets like database credentials and API keys should not be compiled into the image, but rather should be provided when creating containers based on that image. This is why the <code class="inline">Endpoint</code>'s <code class="inline">:secret_key_base</code> is configured in <code class="inline">config/runtime.exs</code> by default.</li>
<li>If possible, any environment variables that are needed at runtime should be read in <code class="inline">config/runtime.exs</code>, not scattered throughout your code. Having them all visible in one place will make it easier to ensure the containers get what they need, especially if the person doing the infrastructure work does not work on the Elixir code. Libraries in particular should never directly read environment variables; all their configuration should be handed to them by the top-level application, preferably <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/library-guidelines.html#avoid-application-configuration">without using the application environment</a>.</li>
