<p>In the Channels guide, we saw that a "Channel" is a layered system with different components. Given this, there would be cases when writing unit tests for our Channel functions may not be enough. We may want to verify that its different moving parts are working together as we expect. This integration testing would assure us that we correctly defined our channel route, the channel module, and its callbacks; and that the lower-level layers such as the PubSub and Transport are configured correctly and are working as intended.</p>
<h2 id="generating-channels" class="section-heading">  Generating channels </h2> <p>As we progress through this guide, it would help to have a concrete example we could work off of. Phoenix comes with a Mix task for generating a basic channel and tests. These generated files serve as a good reference for writing channels and their corresponding tests. Let's go ahead and generate our Channel:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">$ mix phx.gen.channel Room
* creating lib/hello_web/channels/room_channel.ex
* creating test/hello_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs

Add the channel to your `lib/hello_web/channels/user_socket.ex` handler, for example:

    channel "room:lobby", HelloWeb.RoomChannel
</pre>
<p>This creates a channel, its test and instructs us to add a channel route in <code class="inline">lib/hello_web/channels/user_socket.ex</code>. It is important to add the channel route or our channel won't function at all!</p>
<h2 id="the-channelcase" class="section-heading">  The ChannelCase </h2> <p>Open up <code class="inline">test/hello_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs</code> and you will find this:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">defmodule HelloWeb.RoomChannelTest do
  use HelloWeb.ChannelCase</pre>
<p>Similar to <code class="inline">ConnCase</code> and <code class="inline">DataCase</code>, we now have a <code class="inline">ChannelCase</code>. All three of them have been generated for us when we started our Phoenix application. Let's take a look at it. Open up <code class="inline">test/support/channel_case.ex</code>:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">defmodule HelloWeb.ChannelCase do
  use ExUnit.CaseTemplate

  using do
    quote do
      # Import conveniences for testing with channels
      import Phoenix.ChannelTest

      # The default endpoint for testing
      @endpoint HelloWeb.Endpoint
    end
  end

  setup tags do
    pid = Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.start_owner!(Demo.Repo, shared: not tags[:async])
    on_exit(fn -&gt; Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.stop_owner(pid) end)
    :ok
  end
end</pre>
<p>It is very straight-forward. It sets up a case template that imports all of <a href="phoenix.channeltest.html"><code class="inline">Phoenix.ChannelTest</code></a> on use. In the <code class="inline">setup</code> block, it starts the SQL Sandbox, which we discussed in the <a href="testing_contexts.html">Testing contexts guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="subscribe-and-joining" class="section-heading">  Subscribe and joining </h2> <p>Now that we know that Phoenix provides with a custom Test Case just for channels and what it provides, we can move on to understanding the rest of <code class="inline">test/hello_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs</code>.</p>
<p>First off, is the setup block:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">setup do
  {:ok, _, socket} =
    UserSocket
    |&gt; socket("user_id", %{some: :assign})
    |&gt; subscribe_and_join(RoomChannel, "room:lobby")

  %{socket: socket}
end</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline">setup</code> block sets up a <a href="phoenix.socket.html"><code class="inline">Phoenix.Socket</code></a> based on the <code class="inline">UserSocket</code> module, which you can find at <code class="inline">lib/hello_web/channels/user_socket.ex</code>. Then it says we want to subscribe and join the <code class="inline">RoomChannel</code>, accessible as <code class="inline">"room:lobby"</code> in the <code class="inline">UserSocket</code>. At the end of the test, we return the <code class="inline">%{socket: socket}</code> as metadata, so we can reuse it on every test.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, <code class="inline">subscribe_and_join/3</code> emulates the client joining a channel and subscribes the test process to the given topic. This is a necessary step since clients need to join a channel before they can send and receive events on that channel.</p>
<h2 id="testing-a-synchronous-reply" class="section-heading">  Testing a synchronous reply </h2> <p>The first test block in our generated channel test looks like:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">test "ping replies with status ok", %{socket: socket} do
  ref = push(socket, "ping", %{"hello" =&gt; "there"})
  assert_reply ref, :ok, %{"hello" =&gt; "there"}
end</pre>
<p>This tests the following code in our <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.RoomChannel</code>:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir"># Channels can be used in a request/response fashion
# by sending replies to requests from the client
def handle_in("ping", payload, socket) do
  {:reply, {:ok, payload}, socket}
end</pre>
<p>As is stated in the comment above, we see that a <code class="inline">reply</code> is synchronous since it mimics the request/response pattern we are familiar with in HTTP. This synchronous reply is best used when we only want to send an event back to the client when we are done processing the message on the server. For example, when we save something to the database and then send a message to the client only once that's done.</p>
<p>In the <code class="inline">test "ping replies with status ok", %{socket: socket} do</code> line, we see that we have the map <code class="inline">%{socket: socket}</code>. This gives us access to the <code class="inline">socket</code> in the setup block.</p>
<p>We emulate the client pushing a message to the channel with <code class="inline">push/3</code>. In the line <code class="inline">ref = push(socket, "ping", %{"hello" =&gt; "there"})</code>, we push the event <code class="inline">"ping"</code> with the payload <code class="inline">%{"hello" =&gt; "there"}</code> to the channel. This triggers the <code class="inline">handle_in/3</code> callback we have for the <code class="inline">"ping"</code> event in our channel. Note that we store the <code class="inline">ref</code> since we need that on the next line for asserting the reply. With <code class="inline">assert_reply ref, :ok, %{"hello" =&gt; "there"}</code>, we assert that the server sends a synchronous reply <code class="inline">:ok, %{"hello" =&gt; "there"}</code>. This is how we check that the <code class="inline">handle_in/3</code> callback for the <code class="inline">"ping"</code> was triggered.</p>
<h3 id="testing-a-broadcast" class="section-heading">  Testing a Broadcast </h3> <p>It is common to receive messages from the client and broadcast to everyone subscribed to a current topic. This common pattern is simple to express in Phoenix and is one of the generated <code class="inline">handle_in/3</code> callbacks in our <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.RoomChannel</code>.</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">def handle_in("shout", payload, socket) do
  broadcast(socket, "shout", payload)
  {:noreply, socket}
end</pre>
<p>Its corresponding test looks like:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">test "shout broadcasts to room:lobby", %{socket: socket} do
  push(socket, "shout", %{"hello" =&gt; "all"})
  assert_broadcast "shout", %{"hello" =&gt; "all"}
end</pre>
<p>We notice that we access the same <code class="inline">socket</code> that is from the setup block. How handy! We also do the same <code class="inline">push/3</code> as we did in the synchronous reply test. So we <code class="inline">push</code> the <code class="inline">"shout"</code> event with the payload <code class="inline">%{"hello" =&gt; "all"}</code>.</p>
<p>Since the <code class="inline">handle_in/3</code> callback for the <code class="inline">"shout"</code> event just broadcasts the same event and payload, all subscribers in the <code class="inline">"room:lobby"</code> should receive the message. To check that, we do <code class="inline">assert_broadcast "shout", %{"hello" =&gt; "all"}</code>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <code class="inline">assert_broadcast/3</code> tests that the message was broadcast in the PubSub system. For testing if a client receives a message, use <code class="inline">assert_push/3</code>.</p>
<h3 id="testing-an-asynchronous-push-from-the-server" class="section-heading">  Testing an asynchronous push from the server </h3> <p>The last test in our <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.RoomChannelTest</code> verifies that broadcasts from the server are pushed to the client. Unlike the previous tests discussed, we are indirectly testing that our channel's <code class="inline">handle_out/3</code> callback is triggered. This <code class="inline">handle_out/3</code> is defined in our <code class="inline">MyApp.RoomChannel</code> as:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">def handle_out(event, payload, socket) do
  push(socket, event, payload)
  {:noreply, socket}
end</pre>
<p>Since the <code class="inline">handle_out/3</code> event is only triggered when we call <code class="inline">broadcast/3</code> from our channel, we will need to emulate that in our test. We do that by calling <code class="inline">broadcast_from</code> or <code class="inline">broadcast_from!</code>. Both serve the same purpose with the only difference of <code class="inline">broadcast_from!</code> raising an error when broadcast fails.</p>
<p>The line <code class="inline">broadcast_from!(socket, "broadcast", %{"some" =&gt; "data"})</code> will trigger our <code class="inline">handle_out/3</code> callback above which pushes the same event and payload back to the client. To test this, we do <code class="inline">assert_push "broadcast", %{"some" =&gt; "data"}</code>.</p>
<p>That's it. Now you are ready to develop and fully test real-time applications.
