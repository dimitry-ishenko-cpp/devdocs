<h1>Interface SecondaryLoop</h1>      <br> <pre data-language="java">public interface SecondaryLoop</pre> <div>
<p>A helper interface to run the nested event loop. </p>
<p> Objects that implement this interface are created with the <a href="eventqueue.html#createSecondaryLoop--"><code>EventQueue.createSecondaryLoop()</code></a> method. The interface provides two methods, <a href="secondaryloop.html#enter--"><code>enter()</code></a> and <a href="secondaryloop.html#exit--"><code>exit()</code></a>, which can be used to start and stop the event loop. </p>
<p> When the <a href="secondaryloop.html#enter--"><code>enter()</code></a> method is called, the current thread is blocked until the loop is terminated by the <a href="secondaryloop.html#exit--"><code>exit()</code></a> method. Also, a new event loop is started on the event dispatch thread, which may or may not be the current thread. The loop can be terminated on any thread by calling its <a href="secondaryloop.html#exit--"><code>exit()</code></a> method. After the loop is terminated, the <code>SecondaryLoop</code> object can be reused to run a new nested event loop. </p>
<p> A typical use case of applying this interface is AWT and Swing modal dialogs. When a modal dialog is shown on the event dispatch thread, it enters a new secondary loop. Later, when the dialog is hidden or disposed, it exits the loop, and the thread continues its execution. </p>
<p> The following example illustrates a simple use case of secondary loops: </p>
<pre data-language="java">SecondaryLoop loop;

   JButton jButton = new JButton("Button");
   jButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
        @Override
       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
           Toolkit tk = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
           EventQueue eq = tk.getSystemEventQueue();
           loop = eq.createSecondaryLoop();

           // Spawn a new thread to do the work
           Thread worker = new WorkerThread();
           worker.start();

           // Enter the loop to block the current event
           // handler, but leave UI responsive
           if (!loop.enter()) {
               // Report an error
           }
       }
   });

   class WorkerThread extends Thread {
        @Override
       public void run() {
           // Perform calculations
           doSomethingUseful();

           // Exit the loop
           loop.exit();
       }
   }</pre>

<p>Blocks the execution of the current thread and enters a new secondary event loop on the event dispatch thread. </p>
<p> This method can be called by any thread including the event dispatch thread. This thread will be blocked until the <a href="secondaryloop.html#exit--"><code>exit()</code></a> method is called or the loop is terminated. A new secondary loop will be created on the event dispatch thread for dispatching events in either case. </p>
<p> This method can only start one new event loop at a time per object. If a secondary event loop has already been started by this object and is currently still running, this method returns <code>false</code> to indicate that it was not successful in starting a new event loop. Otherwise, this method blocks the calling thread and later returns <code>true</code> when the new event loop is terminated. At such time, this object can again be used to start another new event loop.</p>
</div> <dl> <dt>Returns:</dt> <dd>
<code>true</code> after termination of the secondary loop, if the secondary loop was started by this call, <code>false</code> otherwise</dd> </dl>    <h3 id="exit--">exit</h3> <pre data-language="java">boolean exit()</pre> <div>
<p>Unblocks the execution of the thread blocked by the <a href="secondaryloop.html#enter--"><code>enter()</code></a> method and exits the secondary loop. </p>
<p> This method resumes the thread that called the <a href="secondaryloop.html#enter--"><code>enter()</code></a> method and exits the secondary loop that was created when the <a href="secondaryloop.html#enter--"><code>enter()</code></a> method was invoked. </p>
<p> Note that if any other secondary loop is started while this loop is running, the blocked thread will not resume execution until the nested loop is terminated. </p>
<p> If this secondary loop has not been started with the <a href="secondaryloop.html#enter--"><code>enter()</code></a> method, or this secondary loop has already finished with the <a href="secondaryloop.html#exit--"><code>exit()</code></a> method, this method returns <code>false</code>, otherwise <code>true</code> is returned.</p>
</div> <dl> <dt>Returns:</dt> <dd>
<code>true</code> if this loop was previously started and has not yet been finished with the <a href="secondaryloop.html#exit--"><code>exit()</code></a> method, <code>false</code> otherwise</dd> </dl>    </div><div class="_attribution">
