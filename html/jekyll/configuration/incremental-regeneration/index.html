<h1>Default Configuration</h1> <h2 id="incremental-regeneration">Incremental Regeneration</h2> <blockquote class="note warning"> <h5>Incremental regeneration is still an experimental feature</h5> <p> While incremental regeneration will work for the most common cases, it will not work correctly in every scenario. Please be extremely cautious when using the feature, and report any problems not listed below by <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/new">opening an issue on GitHub</a>. </p> </blockquote> <p>Incremental regeneration helps shorten build times by only generating documents and pages that were updated since the previous build. It does this by keeping track of both file modification times and inter-document dependencies in the <code>.jekyll-metadata</code> file.</p> <p>Under the current implementation, incremental regeneration will only generate a document or page if either it, or one of its dependencies, is modified. Currently, the only types of dependencies tracked are includes (using the <code>{% include %}</code> tag) and layouts. This means that plain references to other documents (for example, the common case of iterating over <code>site.posts</code> in a post listings page) will not be detected as a dependency.</p> <p>To remedy some of these shortfalls, putting <code>regenerate: true</code> in the front-matter of a document will force Jekyll to regenerate it regardless of whether it has been modified. Note that this will generate the specified document only; references to other documents’ contents will not work since they won’t be re-rendered.</p> <p>Incremental regeneration can be enabled via the <code>--incremental</code> flag (<code>-I</code> for short) from the command-line or by setting <code>incremental: true</code> in your configuration file.</p><div class="_attribution">
