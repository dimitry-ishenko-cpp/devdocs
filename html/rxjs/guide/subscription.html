<h1 id="subscription">Subscription</h1> <p><strong>What is a Subscription?</strong> A Subscription is an object that represents a disposable resource, usually the execution of an Observable. A Subscription has one important method, <code>unsubscribe</code>, that takes no argument and just disposes the resource held by the subscription. In previous versions of RxJS, Subscription was called "Disposable".</p> <pre data-language="typescript">import { interval } from 'rxjs';

const observable = interval(1000);
const subscription = observable.subscribe(x =&gt; console.log(x));
// Later:
// This cancels the ongoing Observable execution which
// was started by calling subscribe with an Observer.
subscription.unsubscribe();</pre> <p><span class="informal">A Subscription essentially just has an <code>unsubscribe()</code> function to release resources or cancel Observable executions.</span></p> <p>Subscriptions can also be put together, so that a call to an <code>unsubscribe()</code> of one Subscription may unsubscribe multiple Subscriptions. You can do this by "adding" one subscription into another:</p> <pre data-language="typescript">import { interval } from 'rxjs';

const observable1 = interval(400);
const observable2 = interval(300);

const subscription = observable1.subscribe(x =&gt; console.log('first: ' + x));
const childSubscription = observable2.subscribe(x =&gt; console.log('second: ' + x));

subscription.add(childSubscription);

setTimeout(() =&gt; {
  // Unsubscribes BOTH subscription and childSubscription
  subscription.unsubscribe();
}, 1000);</pre> <p>When executed, we see in the console:</p> <pre data-language="none">second: 0
first: 0
second: 1
first: 1
second: 2</pre> <p>Subscriptions also have a <code>remove(otherSubscription)</code> method, in order to undo the addition of a child Subscription.</p><div class="_attribution">
