<span class="number">1</span> Overview and usage</h2> <p>OCaml, since version 5.0, allows shared-memory parallelism and thus mutation of data shared between multiple threads. This creates the possibility of data races, i.e., unordered accesses to the same memory location with at least one of them being a write. In OCaml, data races are easy to introduce, and the behaviour of programs with data races can be unintuitive — the observed behaviours cannot be explained by simply interleaving operations from different concurrent threads. More information about data races and their consequences can be found in section ‍<a href="parallelism.html#s%3Apar_mm_easy">9.4</a> and Chapter ‍<a href="memorymodel.html#c%3Amemorymodel">10</a>.</p>
<p>To help detect data races, OCaml supports ThreadSantizer (TSan), a dynamic data race detector that has been successfully used in languages such as C/C++, Swift, etc. TSan support for OCaml is available since OCaml 5.2.</p>
<p>To use TSan, you must configure the compiler with <span class="font-tt">--enable-tsan</span>. You can also install an <span class="font-tt">opam</span> switch with the TSan feature enabled as follows:</p>
<pre data-language="ocaml">opam switch create &lt;YOUR-SWITCH-NAME-HERE&gt; ocaml-option-tsan
</pre>
<p> TSan support for OCaml is currently available for the x86_64 architecture, on FreeBSD, Linux and macOS, and for the arm64 architecture on Linux and macOS. Building OCaml with TSan support requires GCC or Clang. Minimal supported versions are GCC 11 and Clang 14. Note that TSan data race reports with GCC 11 are known to result in poor stack trace reporting (no line numbers), which is fixed in GCC 12.</p>
<p>A TSan-enabled compiler differs from a regular compiler in the following way: all programs compiled by <span class="font-tt">ocamlopt</span> are instrumented with calls to the TSan runtime, and TSan will detect data races encountered during execution.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the following program:</p>
<div class="caml-example verbatim"> <div class="ocaml"> <pre class=" caml-input" data-language="ocaml">let a = ref 0 and b = ref 0

let d1 () =
  a := 1;
  !b

let d2 () =
  b := 1;
  !a

let () =
  let h = Domain.spawn d2 in
  let r1 = d1 () in
  let r2 = Domain.join h in
  assert (not (r1 = 0 &amp;&amp; r2 = 0))</pre>
</div> </div>
<p>This program has data races. The memory locations <span class="font-tt">a</span> and <span class="font-tt">b</span> are read and written concurrently by multiple domains <span class="font-tt">d1</span> and <span class="font-tt">d2</span>. <span class="font-tt">a</span> and <span class="font-tt">b</span> are “non-atomic” locations according to the memory model (see Chapter ‍<a href="memorymodel.html#c%3Amemorymodel">10</a>), and there is no synchronization between accesses to them. Hence, there are two data races here corresponding to the two memory locations <span class="font-tt">a</span> and <span class="font-tt">b</span>.</p>
<p>When you compile and run this program with <span class="font-tt">ocamlopt</span>, you may observe data race reports on the standard error, such as:</p>

==================
ThreadSanitizer: reported 2 warnings
</pre>
<p> For each detected data race, TSan reports the location of the conflicting accesses, their nature (read, write, atomic read, etc.), and the associated stack trace.</p>
<p>If you run the above program several times, the output may vary: sometimes TSan will report two data races, sometimes one, and sometimes none. This is due to the combination of two factors:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li class="li-itemize"> First, TSan reports only the data races encountered during execution, i.e., conflicting, unordered memory accesses that are effectively performed. </li>
<li class="li-itemize">In addition, in this program, depending on executions, there may be no such memory accesses: if <span class="font-tt">d1</span> returns before <span class="font-tt">d2</span> has finished spawning, then all memory accesses originating from <span class="font-tt">d1</span> may happen-before the ones originating from <span class="font-tt">d2</span>, since spawning a domain involves inter-thread synchronization. In that case, the accesses are considered to be ordered and no data race is reported. </li>
</ul>
<p>This example illustrates the fact that data races can sometimes be hidden by unrelated synchronizing operations.</p> <h2 class="section" id="s:tsan-performance">
<a class="section-anchor" href="#s:tsan-performance" aria-hidden="true">﻿</a><span class="number">2</span> Performance implications</h2> <p>TSan instrumentation imposes a non-negligible cost at runtime. Empirically, this cost has been observed to cause a slowdown which can range from 2x to 7x. One of the main factors of high slowdowns is frequent access to mutable data. In contrast, the initialising writes to and reads from immutable memory locations are not instrumented. TSan also allocates very large amounts of virtual memory, although it uses only a fraction of it. The memory consumption is increased by a factor between 4 and 7.</p> <h2 class="section" id="s:tsan-false-neg-false-pos">
<a class="section-anchor" href="#s:tsan-false-neg-false-pos" aria-hidden="true">﻿</a><span class="number">3</span> False negatives and false positives</h2> <p>As illustrated by the previous example, TSan will only report the data races encountered during execution. Another important caveat is that TSan remembers only a finite number of memory accesses per memory location. At the time of writing, this number is 4. Data races involving a forgotten access will not be detected. Lastly, the <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerAlgorithm">documentation of TSan</a> states that there is a tiny probability to miss a race if two threads access the same location at the same time. TSan may overlook data races only in these three specific cases.</p>
<p>For data races between two memory accesses made from OCaml code, TSan does not produce false positives; that is, TSan will not emit spurious reports.</p>
<p>When mixing OCaml and C code, through the use of C primitives, the very notion of false positive becomes less clear, as it involves two memory models – OCaml and C11. However, TSan should behave mostly as one would expect: non-atomic reads and writes in C will race with non-atomic reads and writes in OCaml, and C atomics will not race with OCaml atomics. There is one theoretical possibility of false positive: if a <span class="font-tt">value</span> is initialized from C without using <span class="font-tt">caml_initialize</span> (which is allowed under the condition that the GC does not run between the allocation and the write, see Chapter ‍<a href="intfc.html#c%3Aintf-c">22</a>) and a conflicting access is made later by another thread. This does not constitute a data race, but TSan may report it as such.</p> <h2 class="section" id="s:tsan-runtime-flags">
<a class="section-anchor" href="#s:tsan-runtime-flags" aria-hidden="true">﻿</a><span class="number">4</span> Runtime options</h2> <p>TSan supports a number of configuration options at runtime using the <span class="font-tt">TSAN_OPTIONS</span> environment variable. <span class="font-tt">TSAN_OPTIONS</span> should contain one or more options separated by spaces. See the <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags">documentation of TSan flags</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/SanitizerCommonFlags">documentation of flags common to all sanitizers</a> for more information. Notably, <span class="font-tt">TSAN_OPTIONS</span> allows suppressing some data races from TSan reports. Suppressing data race reports is useful for intentional races or libraries that cannot be fixed.</p>
<p>For example, to suppress reports originating from functions in the OCaml module <span class="font-tt">My_module</span>, one can run</p>
<pre data-language="ocaml">TSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=suppr.txt" ./my_instrumented_program
</pre>
<p> with <span class="font-tt">suppr.txt</span> a file containing:</p>
<pre data-language="ocaml">race_top:^camlMy_module
</pre>
<p> (Note that this depends on the format of OCaml symbols in the executable. Some builders, like Dune, might result in different formats. You should adapt this example to the symbols effectively present in your stack traces.)</p>
<p>The <span class="font-tt">TSAN_OPTIONS</span> variable also allows for increasing the “history size”, e.g.:</p>
<pre data-language="ocaml">TSAN_OPTIONS="history_size=7" ./my_instrumented_program
</pre>
<p> TSan’s history records events such as function entry and exit, and is used to reconstruct stack traces. Increasing the history size can sometimes be necessary to obtain the second stack trace, but it also increases memory consumption. This setting does not change the number of memory accesses remembered per memory location.</p> <h2 class="section" id="s:tsan-c-code">
<a class="section-anchor" href="#s:tsan-c-code" aria-hidden="true">﻿</a><span class="number">5</span> Guidelines for linking</h2> <p>As a general rule, OCaml programs instrumented with TSan should only be linked with OCaml or C objects also instrumented with TSan. Doing otherwise may result in crashes. The only exception to this rule are C libraries that do not call into the OCaml runtime system in any way, i.e., do not allocate, raise exceptions, call back into OCaml code, etc. Examples include the libc or system libraries. Data races in non-instrumented libraries will not be reported.</p>
<p>C code interacting with OCaml should always be built through the <span class="font-tt">ocamlopt</span> command, which will pass the required instrumentation flags to the C compiler. The <span class="font-tt">CAMLno_tsan</span> qualifier can be used to prevent functions from being instrumented:</p>
<pre data-language="ocaml">CAMLno_tsan void f(int arg)
{
  /* This function will not be instrumented. */
  ...
}
</pre>
<p> Races from non-instrumented functions will not be reported. <span class="font-tt">CAMLno_tsan</span> should only be used by experts. It can be used to reduce the performance overhead in certain corner cases, or to suppress some known alarms. For the latter, using a suppressions file with <span class="font-tt">TSAN_OPTIONS</span> should be preferred when possible, as it allows for finer-grained control, and qualifying a function <span class="font-tt">f</span> with <span class="font-tt">CAMLno_tsan</span> results in missing entries in TSan’s stack traces when a data race happens in a transitive callee of <span class="font-tt">f</span>.</p>
<p>There is no way to disable instrumentation in OCaml code.</p> <h2 class="section" id="s:tsan-signal-changes">
<a class="section-anchor" href="#s:tsan-signal-changes" aria-hidden="true">﻿</a><span class="number">6</span> Changes in the delivery of signals</h2> <p>TSan intercepts all signals and passes them down to the instrumented program. This overlay from TSan is not always transparent for the program. Synchronous signals such as <span class="font-tt">SIGSEV</span>, <span class="font-tt">SIGILL</span>, <span class="font-tt">SIGBUS</span>, etc. will be passed down immediately, whereas asynchronous signals such as <span class="font-tt">SIGINT</span> will be delayed until the next call to the TSan runtime (e.g. until the next access to mutable data). This limitation of TSan can have surprising effects: for instance, pure, recursive functions that do not allocate cannot be interrupted until they terminate. </p>  <div class="bottom-navigation">
