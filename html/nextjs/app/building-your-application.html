<h1 class="break-words">Building Your Application</h1> <p>Next.js provides the building blocks to create flexible, full-stack web applications. The guides in <strong>Building Your Application</strong> explain how to use these features and how to customize your application's behavior.</p> <p>The sections and pages are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your Next.js application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.</p> <p>If you're new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the <a href="building-your-application/routing.html">Routing</a>, <a href="building-your-application/rendering.html">Rendering</a>, <a href="building-your-application/data-fetching.html">Data Fetching</a> and <a href="building-your-application/styling.html">Styling</a> sections, as they introduce the fundamental Next.js and web concepts to help you get started. Then, you can dive deeper into the other sections such as <a href="building-your-application/optimizing.html">Optimizing</a> and <a href="building-your-application/configuring.html">Configuring</a>. Finally, once you're ready, checkout the <a href="building-your-application/deploying.html">Deploying</a> and <a href="building-your-application/upgrading.html">Upgrading</a> sections.</p><div class="_attribution">
