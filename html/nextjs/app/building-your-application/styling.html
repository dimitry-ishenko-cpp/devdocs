<h1 class="break-words">Styling</h1> <p>Next.js supports different ways of styling your application, including:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Global CSS</strong>: Simple to use and familiar for those experienced with traditional CSS, but can lead to larger CSS bundles and difficulty managing styles as the application grows.</li> <li>
<strong>CSS Modules</strong>: Create locally scoped CSS classes to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.</li> <li>
<strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid custom designs by composing utility classes.</li> <li>
<strong>Sass</strong>: A popular CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.</li> <li>
<strong>CSS-in-JS</strong>: Embed CSS directly in your JavaScript components, enabling dynamic and scoped styling.</li> </ul> <p>Learn more about each approach by exploring their respective documentation:</p><div class="_attribution">
