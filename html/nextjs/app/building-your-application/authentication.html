<h1 class="break-words">Authentication</h1>
<p>To implement authentication in Next.js, familiarize yourself with three foundational concepts:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong><a href="#authentication">Authentication</a></strong> verifies if the user is who they say they are. It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="#session-management">Session Management</a></strong> tracks the user's state (e.g. logged in) across multiple requests.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="#authorization">Authorization</a></strong> decides what parts of the application the user is allowed to access.</li> </ul> <p>This page demonstrates how to use Next.js features to implement common authentication, authorization, and session management patterns so you can choose the best solutions based on your application's needs.</p> <h2 id="authentication" data-docs-heading="">Authentication     </h2> <p>Authentication verifies a user's identity. This happens when a user logs in, either with a username and password or through a service like Google. It's all about confirming that users are really who they claim to be, protecting both the user's data and the application from unauthorized access or fraudulent activities.</p> <h3 id="authentication-strategies" data-docs-heading="">Authentication Strategies     </h3> <p>Modern web applications commonly use several authentication strategies:</p> <ol> <li>
<strong>OAuth/OpenID Connect (OIDC)</strong>: Enable third-party access without sharing user credentials. Ideal for social media logins and Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions. They add an identity layer with OpenID Connect.</li> <li>
<strong>Credentials-based login (Email + Password)</strong>: A standard choice for web applications, where users log in with an email and password. Familiar and easy to implement, it requires robust security measures against threats like phishing.</li> <li>
<strong>Passwordless/Token-based authentication</strong>: Use email magic links or SMS one-time codes for secure, password-free access. Popular for its convenience and enhanced security, this method helps reduce password fatigue. Its limitation is the dependency on the user's email or phone availability.</li> <li>
<strong>Passkeys/WebAuthn</strong>: Use cryptographic credentials unique to each site, offering high security against phishing. Secure but new, this strategy can be difficult to implement.</li> </ol> <p>Selecting an authentication strategy should align with your application's specific requirements, user interface considerations, and security objectives.</p> <h3 id="implementing-authentication" data-docs-heading="">Implementing Authentication     </h3> <p>In this section, we'll explore the process of adding basic email-password authentication to a web application. While this method provides a fundamental level of security, it's worth considering more advanced options like OAuth or passwordless logins for enhanced protection against common security threats. The authentication flow we'll discuss is as follows:</p>  <ol> <li>The user submits their credentials through a login form.</li> <li>The form calls a Server Action.</li> <li>Upon successful verification, the process is completed, indicating the user's successful authentication.</li> <li>If verification is unsuccessful, an error message is shown.</li> </ol>
<p>Consider a login form where users can input their credentials:</p>
<div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO code-block_hasFileName__ezlBD not-prose"><pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">import { authenticate } from '@/app/lib/actions'
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    &lt;form action={authenticate}&gt;
      &lt;input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" required /&gt;
      &lt;input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required /&gt;
      &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  )
}</pre></div>
<p>The form above has two input fields for capturing the user's email and password. On submission, it calls the <code>authenticate</code> Server Action.</p>
<p>You can then call your Authentication Provider's API in the Server Action to handle authentication:</p>
<div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO code-block_hasFileName__ezlBD not-prose"><pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">'use server'
 
import { signIn } from '@/auth'
 
export async function authenticate(_currentState: unknown, formData: FormData) {
  try {
    await signIn('credentials', formData)
  } catch (error) {
    if (error) {
      switch (error.type) {
        case 'CredentialsSignin':
          return 'Invalid credentials.'
        default:
          return 'Something went wrong.'
      }
    }
    throw error
  }
}</pre></div> <p>In this code, the <code>signIn</code> method checks the credentials against stored user data. After the authentication provider processes the credentials, there are two possible outcomes:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Successful Authentication</strong>: This outcome implies that the login was successful. Further actions, such as accessing protected routes and fetching user information, can then be initiated.</li> <li>
<strong>Failed Authentication</strong>: In cases where the credentials are incorrect or an error is encountered, the function returns a corresponding error message to indicate the authentication failure.</li> </ul> <p>Finally, in your <code>login-form.tsx</code> component, you can use React's <code>useFormState</code> to call the Server Action and handle form errors, and use <code>useFormStatus</code> to handle the pending state of the form:</p>
<div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO code-block_hasFileName__ezlBD not-prose"><pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">'use client'
 
import { authenticate } from '@/app/lib/actions'
import { useFormState, useFormStatus } from 'react-dom'
 
export default function Page() {
  const [errorMessage, dispatch] = useFormState(authenticate, undefined)
 
  return (
    &lt;form action={dispatch}&gt;
      &lt;input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" required /&gt;
      &lt;input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required /&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;{errorMessage &amp;&amp; &lt;p&gt;{errorMessage}&lt;/p&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;LoginButton /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  )
}
 
function LoginButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus()
 
  const handleClick = (event) =&gt; {
    if (pending) {
      event.preventDefault()
    }
  }
 
  return (
    &lt;button aria-disabled={pending} type="submit" onClick={handleClick}&gt;
      Login
    &lt;/button&gt;
  )
}</pre></div> <p>For a more streamlined authentication setup in Next.js projects, especially when offering multiple login methods, consider using a comprehensive <a href="#examples">authentication solution</a>.</p> <h2 id="authorization" data-docs-heading="">Authorization     </h2> <p>Once a user is authenticated, you'll need to ensure the user is allowed to visit certain routes, and perform operations such as mutating data with Server Actions and calling Route Handlers.</p> <h3 id="protecting-routes-with-middleware" data-docs-heading="">Protecting Routes with Middleware     </h3> <p><a href="routing/middleware.html">Middleware</a> in Next.js helps you control who can access different parts of your website. This is important for keeping areas like the user dashboard protected while having other pages like marketing pages be public. It's recommended to apply Middleware across all routes and specify exclusions for public access.</p> <p>Here's how to implement Middleware for authentication in Next.js:</p> <h4 id="setting-up-middleware" data-docs-heading="">Setting Up Middleware:     </h4> <ul> <li>Create a <code>middleware.ts</code> or <code>.js</code> file in your project's root directory.</li> <li>Include logic to authorize user access, such as checking for authentication tokens.</li> </ul> <h4 id="defining-protected-routes" data-docs-heading="">Defining Protected Routes:     </h4> <ul> <li>Not all routes require authorization. Use the <code>matcher</code> option in your Middleware to specify any routes that do not require authorization checks.</li> </ul> <h4 id="middleware-logic" data-docs-heading="">Middleware Logic:     </h4> <ul> <li>Write logic to verify if a user is authenticated. Check user roles or permissions for route authorization.</li> </ul> <h4 id="handling-unauthorized-access" data-docs-heading="">Handling Unauthorized Access:     </h4> <ul> <li>Redirect unauthorized users to a login or error page as appropriate.</li> </ul> <p>Example Middleware file:</p> <div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO code-block_hasFileName__ezlBD not-prose"><pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
 
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const currentUser = request.cookies.get('currentUser')?.value
 
  if (currentUser &amp;&amp; !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
    return Response.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', request.url))
  }
 
  if (!currentUser &amp;&amp; !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/login')) {
    return Response.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))
  }
}
 
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\.png$).*)'],
}</pre></div>  <p>This example uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/redirect_static" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><code>Response.redirect</code></a> for handling redirects early in the request pipeline, making it efficient and centralizing access control.</p> <p>For specific redirection needs, the <code>redirect</code> function can be used in Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions to provide more control. This is useful for role-based navigation or context-sensitive scenarios.</p>
<div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO code-block_hasFileName__ezlBD not-prose"><pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'
 
export default function Page() {
  // Logic to determine if a redirect is needed
  const accessDenied = true
  if (accessDenied) {
    redirect('/login')
  }
 
  // Define other routes and logic
}</pre></div> <p>After successful authentication, it's important to manage user navigation based on their roles. For example, an admin user might be redirected to an admin dashboard, while a regular user is sent to a different page. This is important for role-specific experiences and conditional navigation, such as prompting users to complete their profile if needed.</p> <p>When setting up authorization, it's important to ensure that the main security checks happen where your app accesses or changes data. While Middleware can be useful for initial validation, it should not be the sole line of defense in protecting your data. The bulk of security checks should be performed in the Data Access Layer (DAL).</p>  <p>This approach, highlighted in <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions">this security blog</a>, advocates for consolidating all data access within a dedicated DAL. This strategy ensures consistent data access, minimizes authorization bugs, and simplifies maintenance. To ensure comprehensive security, consider the following key areas:</p>
<ul> <li>Server Actions: Implement security checks in server-side processes, especially for sensitive operations.</li> <li>Route Handlers: Manage incoming requests with security measures to ensure access is limited to authorized users.</li> <li>Data Access Layer (DAL): Directly interacts with the database and is crucial for validating and authorizing data transactions. It's vital to perform critical checks within the DAL to secure data at its most crucial interaction point—access or modification.</li> </ul>
<p>For a detailed guide on securing the DAL, including example code snippets and advanced security practices, refer to our <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions#data-access-layer">Data Access Layer section</a> of the security guide.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-server-actions" data-docs-heading="">Protecting Server Actions     </h3>
<p>It is important to treat <a href="data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations.html">Server Actions</a> with the same security considerations as public-facing API endpoints. Verifying user authorization for each action is crucial. Implement checks within Server Actions to determine user permissions, such as restricting certain actions to admin users.</p>
<p>In the example below, we check the user's role before allowing the action to proceed:</p>
<div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO code-block_hasFileName__ezlBD not-prose"><pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">'use server'
 
// ...
 
export async function serverAction() {
  const session = await getSession()
  const userRole = session?.user?.role
 
  // Check if user is authorized to perform the action
  if (userRole !== 'admin') {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized access: User does not have admin privileges.')
  }
 
  // Proceed with the action for authorized users
  // ... implementation of the action
}</pre></div>
<h3 id="protecting-route-handlers" data-docs-heading="">Protecting Route Handlers     </h3>
<p>Route Handlers in Next.js play a vital role in managing incoming requests. Just like Server Actions, they should be secured to ensure that only authorized users can access certain functionalities. This often involves verifying the user's authentication status and their permissions.</p>
<p>Here's an example of securing a Route Handler:</p>
<div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO code-block_hasFileName__ezlBD not-prose"><pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">export async function GET() {
  // User authentication and role verification
  const session = await getSession()
 
  // Check if the user is authenticated
  if (!session) {
    return new Response(null, { status: 401 }) // User is not authenticated
  }
 
  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role
  if (session.user.role !== 'admin') {
    return new Response(null, { status: 403 }) // User is authenticated but does not have the right permissions
  }
 
  // Data fetching for authorized users
}</pre></div>
<p>This example demonstrates a Route Handler with a two-tier security check for authentication and authorization. It first checks for an active session, and then verifies if the logged-in user is an 'admin'. This approach ensures secure access, limited to authenticated and authorized users, maintaining robust security for request processing.</p>
<h3 id="authorization-using-server-components" data-docs-heading="">Authorization Using Server Components     </h3>
<p><a href="rendering/server-components.html">Server Components</a> in Next.js are designed for server-side execution and offer a secure environment for integrating complex logic like authorization. They enable direct access to back-end resources, optimizing performance for data-heavy tasks and enhancing security for sensitive operations.</p>
<p>In Server Components, a common practice is to conditionally render UI elements based on the user's role. This approach enhances user experience and security by ensuring users only access content they are authorized to view.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO code-block_hasFileName__ezlBD not-prose"><pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">export default async function Dashboard() {
  const session = await getSession()
  const userRole = session?.user?.role // Assuming 'role' is part of the session object
 
  if (userRole === 'admin') {
    return &lt;AdminDashboard /&gt; // Component for admin users
  } else if (userRole === 'user') {
    return &lt;UserDashboard /&gt; // Component for regular users
  } else {
    return &lt;AccessDenied /&gt; // Component shown for unauthorized access
  }
}</pre></div>
<p>In this example, the Dashboard component renders different UIs for 'admin', 'user', and unauthorized roles. This pattern ensures that each user interacts only with components appropriate to their role, enhancing both security and user experience.</p> <h3 id="best-practices" data-docs-heading="">Best Practices     </h3> <ul> <li>
<strong>Secure Session Management</strong>: Prioritize the security of session data to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Use encryption and secure storage practices.</li> <li>
<strong>Dynamic Role Management</strong>: Use a flexible system for user roles to easily adjust to changes in permissions and roles, avoiding hardcoded roles.</li> <li>
<strong>Security-First Approach</strong>: In all aspects of authorization logic, prioritize security to safeguard user data and maintain the integrity of your application. This includes thorough testing and considering potential security vulnerabilities.</li> </ul> <h2 id="session-management" data-docs-heading="">Session Management     </h2> <p>Session management involves tracking and managing a user's interaction with the application over time, ensuring that their authenticated state is preserved across different parts of the application.</p> <p>This prevents the need for repeated logins, enhancing both security and user convenience. There are two primary methods used for session management: cookie-based and database sessions.</p> <h3 id="cookie-based-sessions" data-docs-heading="">Cookie-Based Sessions     </h3> <blockquote class="p-3 text-sm"> <p><strong>🎥 Watch:</strong> Learn more about cookie-based sessions and authentication with Next.js → <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJvM2lSPn6w" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube (11 minutes)</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cookie-based sessions manage user data by storing encrypted session information directly in browser cookies. Upon user login, this encrypted data is stored in the cookie. Each subsequent server request includes this cookie, minimizing the need for repeated server queries and enhancing client-side efficiency.</p> <p>However, this method requires careful encryption to protect sensitive data, as cookies are susceptible to client-side security risks. Encrypting session data in cookies is key to safeguarding user information from unauthorized access. It ensures that even if a cookie is stolen, the data inside remains unreadable.</p> <p>Additionally, while individual cookies are limited in size (typically around 4KB), techniques like cookie-chunking can overcome this limitation by dividing large session data into multiple cookies.</p> <p>Setting a cookie in a Next.js project might look something like this:</p> <p><strong>Setting a cookie on the server:</strong></p>  <div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO code-block_hasFileName__ezlBD not-prose"><pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">'use server'
 
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
 
export async function handleLogin(sessionData) {
  const encryptedSessionData = encrypt(sessionData) // Encrypt your session data
  cookies().set('session', encryptedSessionData, {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // One week
    path: '/',
  })
  // Redirect or handle the response after setting the cookie
}</pre></div>
<p><strong>Accessing the session data stored in the cookie in a server component:</strong></p>
<div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO code-block_hasFileName__ezlBD not-prose"><pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
 
export async function getSessionData(req) {
  const encryptedSessionData = cookies().get('session')?.value
  return encryptedSessionData ? JSON.parse(decrypt(encryptedSessionData)) : null
}</pre></div> <h3 id="database-sessions" data-docs-heading="">Database Sessions     </h3> <p>Database session management involves storing session data on the server, with the user's browser only receiving a session ID. This ID references the session data stored server-side, without containing the data itself. This method enhances security, as it keeps sensitive session data away from the client-side environment, reducing the risk of exposure to client-side attacks. Database sessions are also more scalable, accommodating larger data storage needs.</p> <p>However, this approach has its tradeoffs. It can increase performance overhead due to the need for database lookups at each user interaction. Strategies like session data caching can help mitigate this. Additionally, reliance on the database means that session management is as reliable as the database's performance and availability.</p> <p>Here's a simplified example of implementing database sessions in a Next.js application:</p> <p><strong>Creating a Session on the Server</strong>:</p>  <div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO not-prose">
<pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">import db from './lib/db'
 
export async function createSession(user) {
  const sessionId = generateSessionId() // Generate a unique session ID
  await db.insertSession({ sessionId, userId: user.id, createdAt: new Date() })
  return sessionId
}</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>Retrieving a Session in Middleware or Server-Side Logic</strong>:</p>
<div class="code-block_wrapper__t6FCO not-prose">
<pre class="code-block_pre___OLfy" data-language="typescript">import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
import db from './lib/db'
 
export async function getSession() {
  const sessionId = cookies().get('sessionId')?.value
  return sessionId ? await db.findSession(sessionId) : null
}</pre>
</div> <h3 id="selecting-session-management-in-nextjs" data-docs-heading="">Selecting Session Management in Next.js     </h3> <p>Deciding between cookie-based and database sessions in Next.js depends on your application's needs. Cookie-based sessions are simpler and suit smaller applications with lower server load but may offer less security. Database sessions, while more complex, provide better security and scalability, ideal for larger, data-sensitive applications.</p> <p>With <a href="#examples">authentication solutions</a> such as <a href="https://authjs.dev/guides/upgrade-to-v5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NextAuth.js</a>, session management becomes more efficient, using either cookies or database storage. This automation simplifies the development process, but it's important to understand the session management method used by your chosen solution. Ensure it aligns with your application's security and performance requirements.</p> <p>Regardless of your choice, prioritize security in your session management strategy. For cookie-based sessions, using secure and HTTP-only cookies is crucial to protect session data. For database sessions, regular backups and secure handling of session data are essential. Implementing session expiry and cleanup mechanisms is vital in both approaches to prevent unauthorized access and maintain application performance and reliability.</p> <h2 id="examples" data-docs-heading="">Examples     </h2> <p>Here are authentication solutions compatible with Next.js, please refer to the quickstart guides below to learn how to configure them in your Next.js application:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/01-login" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Auth0</a></li> <li><a href="https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Clerk</a></li> <li><a href="https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/nextjs-sdk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kinde</a></li> <li><a href="https://lucia-auth.com/getting-started/nextjs-app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lucia</a></li> <li><a href="https://authjs.dev/guides/upgrade-to-v5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NextAuth.js</a></li> <li><a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Supabase</a></li> <li><a href="https://stytch.com/docs/guides/quickstarts/nextjs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Stytch</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/vvo/iron-session" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Iron Session</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="further-reading" data-docs-heading="">Further Reading     </h2> <p>To continue learning about authentication and security, check out the following resources:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://vercel.com/guides/understanding-xss-attacks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Understanding XSS Attacks</a></li> <li><a href="https://vercel.com/guides/understanding-csrf-attacks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Understanding CSRF Attacks</a></li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
