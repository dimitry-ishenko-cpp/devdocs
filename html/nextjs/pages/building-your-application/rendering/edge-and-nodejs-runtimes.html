<h1 class="break-words">Edge and Node.js Runtimes</h1> <p>In the context of Next.js, runtime refers to the set of libraries, APIs, and general functionality available to your code during execution.</p> <p>On the server, there are two runtimes where parts of your application code can be rendered:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>Node.js Runtime</strong> (default) has access to all Node.js APIs and compatible packages from the ecosystem.</li> <li>The <strong>Edge Runtime</strong> is based on <a href="../../../app/api-reference/edge.html">Web APIs</a>.</li> </ul> <h2 id="runtime-differences" data-docs-heading="">Runtime Differences     </h2> <p>There are many considerations to make when choosing a runtime.

</table></div> <h3 id="edge-runtime" data-docs-heading="">Edge Runtime     </h3> <p>In Next.js, the lightweight Edge Runtime is a subset of available Node.js APIs.</p> <p>The Edge Runtime is ideal if you need to deliver dynamic, personalized content at low latency with small, simple functions. The Edge Runtime's speed comes from its minimal use of resources, but that can be limiting in many scenarios.</p> <p>For example, code executed in the Edge Runtime <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/limits/overview#edge-middleware-and-edge-functions-size" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Vercel cannot exceed between 1 MB and 4 MB</a>, this limit includes imported packages, fonts and files, and will vary depending on your deployment infrastructure. In addition, the Edge Runtime does not support all Node.js APIs meaning some <code>npm</code> packages may not work. For example, "Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'" or similar errors. We recommend using the Node.js runtime if you need to use these APIs or packages.</p> <h3 id="nodejs-runtime" data-docs-heading="">Node.js Runtime     </h3> <p>Using the Node.js runtime gives you access to all Node.js APIs, and all npm packages that rely on them. However, it's not as fast to start up as routes using the Edge runtime.</p> <p>Deploying your Next.js application to a Node.js server will require managing, scaling, and configuring your infrastructure. Alternatively, you can consider deploying your Next.js application to a serverless platform like Vercel, which will handle this for you.</p> <h3 id="serverless-nodejs" data-docs-heading="">Serverless Node.js     </h3> <p>Serverless is ideal if you need a scalable solution that can handle more complex computational loads than the Edge Runtime. With Serverless Functions on Vercel, for example, your overall code size is <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/limits/overview#serverless-function-size" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50MB</a> including imported packages, fonts, and files.</p> <p>The downside compared to routes using the <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edge</a> is that it can take hundreds of milliseconds for Serverless Functions to boot up before they begin processing requests. Depending on the amount of traffic your site receives, this could be a frequent occurrence as the functions are not frequently "warm".</p>  <blockquote class="p-3 text-sm"> <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Node.js Docs</a> and <a href="../../../app/api-reference/edge.html">Edge Docs</a> for the full list of available APIs. Both runtimes can also support <a href="../../../app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming.html">streaming</a> depending on your deployment infrastructure.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
