<h1 class="break-words">Production Checklist</h1>
<p>Before taking your Next.js application to production, there are some optimizations and patterns you should consider implementing for the best user experience, performance, and security.</p> <p>This page provides best practices that you can use as a reference when <a href="#during-development">building your application</a>, <a href="#before-going-to-production">before going to production</a>, and <a href="#after-deployment">after deployment</a> - as well as the <a href="#automatic-optimizations">automatic Next.js optimizations</a> you should be aware of.</p> <h2 id="automatic-optimizations" data-docs-heading="">Automatic optimizations     </h2> <p>These Next.js optimizations are enabled by default and require no configuration:</p>  <ul> <li>
<strong><a href="../routing/pages-and-layouts.html">Code-splitting</a>:</strong> Next.js automatically code-splits your application code by pages. This means only the code needed for the current page is loaded on navigation. You may also consider <a href="../optimizing/lazy-loading.html">lazy loading</a> third-party libraries, where appropriate.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="../../api-reference/components/link.html#prefetch">Prefetching</a>:</strong> When a link to a new route enters the user's viewport, Next.js prefetches the route in background. This makes navigation to new routes almost instant. You can opt out of prefetching, where appropriate.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="../rendering/automatic-static-optimization.html">Automatic Static Optimization</a>:</strong> Next.js automatically determines that a page is static (can be pre-rendered) if it has no blocking data requirements. Optimized pages can be cached, and served to the end-user from multiple CDN locations. You may opt into <a href="../data-fetching/get-server-side-props.html">Server-side Rendering</a>, where appropriate.</li> </ul> <p>These defaults aim to improve your application's performance, and reduce the cost and amount of data transferred on each network request.</p> <h2 id="during-development" data-docs-heading="">During development     </h2> <p>While building your application, we recommend using the following features to ensure the best performance and user experience:</p> <h3 id="routing-and-rendering" data-docs-heading="">Routing and rendering     </h3>  <ul> <li>
<strong><a href="../routing/linking-and-navigating.html"><code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component</a>:</strong> Use the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component for client-side navigation and prefetching.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="../routing/custom-error.html">Custom Errors</a>:</strong> Gracefully handle <a href="../routing/custom-error.html#500-page">500</a> and <a href="../routing/custom-error.html#404-page">404 errors</a>
</li> </ul> <h3 id="data-fetching-and-caching" data-docs-heading="">Data fetching and caching     </h3>  <ul> <li>
<strong><a href="../routing/api-routes.html">API Routes</a>:</strong> Use Route Handlers to access your backend resources, and prevent sensitive secrets from being exposed to the client.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="../data-fetching/get-static-props.html">Data Caching</a>:</strong> Verify whether your data requests are being cached or not, and opt into caching, where appropriate. Ensure requests that don't use <code>getStaticProps</code> are cached where appropriate.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="../data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration.html">Incremental Static Regeneration</a>:</strong> Use Incremental Static Regeneration to update static pages after they've been built, without rebuilding your entire site.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="../optimizing/static-assets.html">Static Images</a>:</strong> Use the <code>public</code> directory to automatically cache your application's static assets, e.g. images.</li> </ul> <h3 id="ui-and-accessibility" data-docs-heading="">UI and accessibility     </h3>  <ul> <li>
<strong><a href="../../../app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts.html">Font Module</a>:</strong> Optimize fonts by using the Font Module, which automatically hosts your font files with other static assets, removes external network requests, and reduces <a href="https://web.dev/articles/cls" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">layout shift</a>.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="../../../app/building-your-application/optimizing/images.html"><code>&lt;Image&gt;</code> Component</a>:</strong> Optimize images by using the Image Component, which automatically optimizes images, prevents layout shift, and serves them in modern formats like WebP or AVIF.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="../../../app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts.html"><code>&lt;Script&gt;</code> Component</a>:</strong> Optimize third-party scripts by using the Script Component, which automatically defers scripts and prevents them from blocking the main thread.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="../../../architecture/accessibility.html#linting">ESLint</a>:</strong> Use the built-in <code>eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</code> plugin to catch accessibility issues early.</li> </ul> <h3 id="security" data-docs-heading="">Security     </h3>  <ul> <li>
<strong><a href="../../../app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables.html">Environment Variables</a>:</strong> Ensure your <code>.env.*</code> files are added to <code>.gitignore</code> and only public variables are prefixed with <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_</code>.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="../../../app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy.html">Content Security Policy</a>:</strong> Consider adding a Content Security Policy to protect your application against various security threats such as cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.</li> </ul> <h3 id="metadata-and-seo" data-docs-heading="">Metadata and SEO     </h3>  <ul> <li>
<strong><a href="../../api-reference/components/head.html"><code>&lt;Head&gt;</code> Component</a>:</strong> Use the <code>next/head</code> component to add page titles, descriptions, and more.</li> </ul> <h3 id="type-safety" data-docs-heading="">Type safety     </h3> <ul> <li>
<strong>TypeScript and <a href="../../../app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript.html">TS Plugin</a>:</strong> Use TypeScript and the TypeScript plugin for better type-safety, and to help you catch errors early.</li> </ul> <h2 id="before-going-to-production" data-docs-heading="">Before going to production     </h2> <p>Before going to production, you can run <code>next build</code> to build your application locally and catch any build errors, then run <code>next start</code> to measure the performance of your application in a production-like environment.</p> <h3 id="core-web-vitals" data-docs-heading="">Core Web Vitals     </h3> <ul> <li>
<strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>:</strong> Run lighthouse in incognito to gain a better understanding of how your users will experience your site, and to identify areas for improvement. This is a simulated test and should be paired with looking at field data (such as Core Web Vitals).</li> </ul>  <h3 id="analyzing-bundles" data-docs-heading="">Analyzing bundles     </h3> <p>Use the <a href="../../../app/building-your-application/optimizing/bundle-analyzer.html"><code>@next/bundle-analyzer</code> plugin</a> to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles and identify large modules and dependencies that might be impacting your application's performance.</p> <p>Additionally, the following tools can you understand the impact of adding new dependencies to your application:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Import Cost</a></li> <li><a href="https://packagephobia.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Package Phobia</a></li> <li><a href="https://bundlephobia.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Bundle Phobia</a></li> <li><a href="https://bundlejs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">bundlejs</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="after-deployment" data-docs-heading="">After deployment     </h2> <p>Depending on where you deploy your application, you might have access to additional tools and integrations to help you monitor and improve your application's performance.</p> <p>For Vercel deployments, we recommend the following:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong><a href="https://vercel.com/analytics?utm_source=next-site&amp;utm_campaign=nextjs-docs&amp;utm_medium=docs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Analytics</a>:</strong> A built-in analytics dashboard to help you understand your application's traffic, including the number of unique visitors, page views, and more.</li> <li>
