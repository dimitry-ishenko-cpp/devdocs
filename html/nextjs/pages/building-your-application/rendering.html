<h1 class="break-words">Rendering</h1>
<p>By default, Next.js <strong>pre-renders</strong> every page. This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.</p> <p>Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive (this process is called <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">hydration</a> in React).</p> <h3 id="pre-rendering" data-docs-heading="">Pre-rendering     </h3> <p>Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: <strong>Static Generation</strong> and <strong>Server-side Rendering</strong>. The difference is in <strong>when</strong> it generates the HTML for a page.</p> <ul> <li>Static Generation: The HTML is generated at <strong>build time</strong> and will be reused on each request.</li> <li>Server-side Rendering: The HTML is generated on <strong>each request</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>Importantly, Next.js lets you choose which pre-rendering form you'd like to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.</p> <p>We recommend using Static Generation over Server-side Rendering for performance reasons. Statically generated pages can be cached by CDN with no extra configuration to boost performance. However, in some cases, Server-side Rendering might be the only option.</p> <p>You can also use client-side data fetching along with Static Generation or Server-side Rendering. That means some parts of a page can be rendered entirely by clientside JavaScript.
