<section id="learn-to-code-with-gdscript"> <h1 id="doc-learn-to-code-with-gdscript">Learn to code with GDScript</h1> <p>In Godot, you can write code using the GDScript and C# programming languages.</p> <p>If you are new to programming, we recommend starting with GDScript because we designed it to be simpler than all-purpose languages like C#. It will be both faster and easier to learn.</p> <p>While GDScript is a language specific to Godot, the techniques you will learn with it will apply to other programming languages.</p> <p>Note that it is completely normal for a programmer to learn and use multiple languages. Programming languages have more similarities than differences, so once you know one, you can learn another much faster.</p> <section id="learn-in-your-browser-with-the-gdscript-app"> <h2>Learn in your browser with the GDScript app</h2> <p>To learn GDScript, you can use the app Learn GDScript From Zero. It is a complete beginner course with interactive practices you can do right in your browser.</p> <img alt="../../_images/learn_gdscript_app.webp" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.2/_images/learn_gdscript_app.webp"> <p>Click here to access the app: <a href="https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/?ref=godot-docs">Learn GDScript From Zero app</a></p> <p>This app is an open-source project.
