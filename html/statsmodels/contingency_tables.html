<h1 id="id1">Contingency tables</h1> <p id="contingency-tables">Statsmodels supports a variety of approaches for analyzing contingency tables, including methods for assessing independence, symmetry, homogeneity, and methods for working with collections of tables from a stratified population.</p> <p>The methods described here are mainly for two-way tables. Multi-way tables can be analyzed using log-linear models. Statsmodels does not currently have a dedicated API for loglinear modeling, but Poisson regression in <code>statsmodels.genmod.GLM</code> can be used for this purpose.</p> <p>A contingency table is a multi-way table that describes a data set in which each observation belongs to one category for each of several variables. For example, if there are two variables, one with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> levels and one with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> levels, then we have a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r \times c\)</span> contingency table. The table can be described in terms of the number of observations that fall into a given cell of the table, e.g. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{ij}\)</span> is the number of observations that have level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> for the first variable and level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> for the second variable. Note that each variable must have a finite number of levels (or categories), which can be either ordered or unordered. In different contexts, the variables defining the axes of a contingency table may be called <strong>categorical variables</strong> or <strong>factor variables</strong>. They may be either <strong>nominal</strong> (if their levels are unordered) or <strong>ordinal</strong> (if their levels are ordered).</p> <p>The underlying population for a contingency table is described by a <strong>distribution table</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{i, j}\)</span>. The elements of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> are probabilities, and the sum of all elements in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> is 1. Methods for analyzing contingency tables use the data in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> to learn about properties of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>.</p> <p>The <code>statsmodels.stats.Table</code> is the most basic class for working with contingency tables. We can create a <code>Table</code> object directly from any rectangular array-like object containing the contingency table cell counts:</p> <pre data-language="python">In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: import pandas as pd

In [3]: import statsmodels.api as sm

In [4]: df = sm.datasets.get_rdataset("Arthritis", "vcd").data

In [5]: tab = pd.crosstab(df['Treatment'], df['Improved'])

In [6]: tab = tab.loc[:, ["None", "Some", "Marked"]]

In [7]: table = sm.stats.Table(tab)
</pre> <p>Alternatively, we can pass the raw data and let the Table class construct the array of cell counts for us:</p> <pre data-language="python">In [8]: table = sm.stats.Table.from_data(df[["Treatment", "Improved"]])
</pre>  <h2 id="independence">Independence</h2> <p><strong>Independence</strong> is the property that the row and column factors occur independently. <strong>Association</strong> is the lack of independence. If the joint distribution is independent, it can be written as the outer product of the row and column marginal distributions:</p> <div class="math notranslate nohighlight"> \[\]</div> <p>P_{ij} = sum_k P_{ij} cdot sum_k P_{kj} forall i, j</p> <p>We can obtain the best-fitting independent distribution for our observed data, and then view residuals which identify particular cells that most strongly violate independence:</p> <pre data-language="python">In [9]: print(table.table_orig)
Improved   Marked  None  Some
Treatment                    
Placebo         7    29     7
Treated        21    13     7

In [10]: print(table.fittedvalues)
