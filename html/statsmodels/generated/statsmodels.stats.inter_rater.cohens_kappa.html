However, the computation are invariant to rescaling of the weights matrix, so there is no difference in the results.</p> <p>Weights for ‘linear’ and ‘quadratic’ are interpreted as scores for the categories, the weights in the computation are based on the pairwise difference between the scores. Weights for ‘toeplitz’ are a interpreted as weighted distance. The distance only depends on how many levels apart two entries in the table are but not on the levels themselves.</p> <p>example:</p> <p>weights = ‘0, 1, 2, 3’ and wt is either linear or toeplitz means that the weighting only depends on the simple distance of levels.</p> <p>weights = ‘0, 0, 1, 1’ and wt = ‘linear’ means that the first two levels are zero distance apart and the same for the last two levels. This is the sampe as forming two aggregated levels by merging the first two and the last two levels, respectively.</p> <p>weights = [0, 1, 2, 3] and wt = ‘quadratic’ is the same as squaring these weights and using wt = ‘toeplitz’.</p> <h4 class="rubric">References</h4> <p>Wikipedia SAS Manual</p> </dd>
