<p>For any issue, there are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:</p>
<ol>
<li>By opening the issue for discussion: If you believe that you have found a new bug in Electron, you should report it by creating a new issue in the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>electron/electron</code> issue tracker</a>.</li>
<li>By helping to triage the issue: You can do this either by providing assistive details (a reproducible test case that demonstrates a bug) or by providing suggestions to address the issue.</li>
<li>By helping to resolve the issue: This can be done by demonstrating that the issue is not a bug or is fixed; but more often, by opening a pull request that changes the source in <code>electron/electron</code> in a concrete and reviewable manner.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://electronjs.org/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Electron website</a> has a list of resources for getting programming help, reporting security issues, contributing, and more. Please use the issue tracker for bugs only!</p>

<p>To submit a bug report:</p>
<p>When opening a new issue in the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>electron/electron</code> issue tracker</a>, users will be presented with a template that should be filled in.</p>
<p>If you believe that you have found a bug in Electron, please fill out the template to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>The two most important pieces of information needed to evaluate the report are a description of the bug and a simple test case to recreate it. It is easier to fix a bug if it can be reproduced.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>It's common for open issues to involve discussion. Some contributors may have differing opinions, including whether the behavior is a bug or feature. This discussion is part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and professional.</p>
<p>Terse responses that provide neither additional context nor supporting detail are not helpful or professional. To many, such responses are annoying and unfriendly.</p>
<p>Contributors are encouraged to solve issues collaboratively and help one another make progress. If you encounter an issue that you feel is invalid, or which contains incorrect information, explain <em>why</em> you feel that way with additional supporting context, and be willing to be convinced that you may be wrong. By doing so, we can often reach the correct outcome faster.</p>

<p>Most issues are resolved by opening a pull request. The process for opening and reviewing a pull request is similar to that of opening and triaging issues, but carries with it a necessary review and approval workflow that ensures that the proposed changes meet the minimal quality and functional guidelines of the Electron project.</p><div class="_attribution">
