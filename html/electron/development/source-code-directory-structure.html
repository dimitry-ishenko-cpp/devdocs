<h1>Source Code Directory Structure</h1>
<p>The source code of Electron is separated into a few parts, mostly following Chromium on the separation conventions.</p>
<p>You may need to become familiar with <a href="https://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/multi-process-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromium's multi-process architecture</a> to understand the source code better.</p>
