<h1 id="bureaucracy-package">Bureaucracy package</h1> <p>It happens to almost every program. It starts small, tiny if you will, like a village where every actor knows every other actor and shutdown is easy. One day you realize your program is no longer a cute seaside hamlet, its a bustling metropolis and you are doing way too much work to keep track of everything. What do you do? Call for a little bureaucracy.</p> <p>The bureaucracy contains objects designed to ease your bookkeeping burdens. Need to shutdown a number of actors together? Check out <code>Custodian</code>. Need to keep track of a lot of stuff and be able to look it up by name? Check out <code>Registrar</code>.</p> <p>Put bureaucracy to use today and before long, your sprawling metropolis of a code base will be manageable again in no time.</p> <h2 id="public-types">Public Types</h2> <ul> <li><a href="bureaucracy-registrar.html">actor Registrar</a></li> <li><a href="bureaucracy-custodian.html">actor Custodian</a></li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
