<h1>Installation</h1>  <div id="intro"> There are many different ways to install and use Handlebars, the following are some of the more popular. Please send <a href="https://github.com/wycats/handlebars-site/blob/master/src/pages/installation.haml">pull requests</a> if we are missing one! </div> <div> <div> <div> The fastest route is to manually download the package and copy into your project but a number of other systems are available. <a class="download" href="http://builds.handlebarsjs.com.s3.amazonaws.com/handlebars-v4.0.12.js">Download: 4.0.12</a> <a class="download-runtime" href="http://builds.handlebarsjs.com.s3.amazonaws.com/handlebars.runtime-v4.0.12.js">Download: runtime-4.0.12</a> </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="npm"> NPM </h2> <div> <div> <div> Handlebar's npm package includes both libraries suitable for CommonJS aware systems and built browser libraries that can be consumed direct browser mechanisms. </div> <pre class="sunburst" data-language="html">npm install --save handlebars
</pre> <div> Require-aware systems such as Node and Webpack can then load via: </div> <pre class="sunburst" data-language="html">require('handlebars');
</pre> <div> or for the runtime only: </div> <pre class="sunburst" data-language="html">require('handlebars/runtime');
</pre> </div> <div> <div> The browser builds are located in the <code>node_modules/handlebars/dist/</code> directory. Making these accessible to the browser will depend on what build system you are using but this may be as simple as copying the files to an acessible place. </div> <div> This is the preferred method of installation when using the precompiler as it ensures that your precompiled templates always run against the same version of the runtime. </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="bower"> Bower </h2> <div> <div> <div> Handlebars maintains a <a href="https://github.com/components/handlebars.js">bower component</a> as well that is available for <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a> users. This can be installed in a project like so. </div> <pre class="sunburst" data-language="html">bower install --save handlebars
</pre> <div> The default bower library is UMD-style so this should work properly with global, CJS, and AMD module systems. <code>handlebars.js</code> and <code>handlebars.runtime.js</code> are the primary source files but a number of other options exist in this component. We recommend looking at them and selecting the best one for your needs. </div> <div> This component should also work with other packagers such as <a href="https://github.com/componentjs/component">component</a> but these have not been tested as throughly. </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="download"> Manual Download </h2> <div> <div> <div> All of Handlebar's released versions and CI builds are available for download on S3 in our <a href="http://builds.handlebarsjs.com.s3.amazonaws.com/bucket-listing.html?sort=lastmod&amp;sortdir=desc">builds page</a>. </div> <div> The latest passing master build is named <code>handlebars-latest.js</code> and each passing SHA on master will create a <code>handlebars-gitSHA.js</code> file. While these all pass the CI, it's preferrable to use one of the tagged releases. </div> <div> **Note**: The S3 builds page is provided as a convenience for the community, but you should not use it for hosting Handlebars in production. </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="cdn"> CDNs </h2> <div> <div> <div> Handlebars is hosted on a number of free CDNs as well. <ul> <li><a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/handlebars.js">cdnjs</a></li> <li>
<a href="http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!handlebarsjs">jsDelivr</a>. Advanced usage, such as <a href="https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#usage">version aliasing &amp; concocting</a>, is available.</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
