<h1>Front Matter Defaults</h1> <p>Using <a href="../../front-matter/index.html">front matter</a> is one way that you can specify configuration in the pages and posts for your site. Setting things like a default layout, or customizing the title, or specifying a more precise date/time for the post can all be added to your page or post front matter.</p> <p>Often times, you will find that you are repeating a lot of configuration options. Setting the same layout in each file, adding the same category - or categories - to a post, etc. You can even add custom variables like author names, which might be the same for the majority of posts on your blog.</p> <p>Instead of repeating this configuration each time you create a new post or page, Jekyll provides a way to set these defaults in the site configuration. To do this, you can specify site-wide defaults using the <code>defaults</code> key in the <code>_config.yml</code> file in your project’s root directory.</p> <p>The <code>defaults</code> key holds an array of scope/values pairs that define what defaults should be set for a particular file path, and optionally, a file type in that path.</p> <p>Let’s say that you want to add a default layout to all pages and posts in your site. You would add this to your <code>_config.yml</code> file:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: "" # an empty string here means all files in the project
    values:
      layout: "default"
</pre> <blockquote class="note info"> <h5>Stop and rerun `jekyll serve` command.</h5> <p> The <code>_config.yml</code> master configuration file contains global configurations and variable definitions that are read once at execution time. Changes made to <code>_config.yml</code> during automatic regeneration are not loaded until the next execution. </p> <p> Note <a href="../../datafiles/index.html">Data Files</a> are included and reloaded during automatic regeneration. </p> </blockquote> <p>Here, we are scoping the <code>values</code> to any file that exists in the path <code>scope</code>. Since the path is set as an empty string, it will apply to <strong>all files</strong> in your project. You probably don’t want to set a layout on every file in your project - like css files, for example - so you can also specify a <code>type</code> value under the <code>scope</code> key.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: "" # an empty string here means all files in the project
      type: "posts" # previously `post` in Jekyll 2.2.
    values:
      layout: "default"
</pre> <p>Now, this will only set the layout for files where the type is <code>posts</code>. The different types that are available to you are <code>pages</code>, <code>posts</code>, <code>drafts</code> or any collection in your site. While <code>type</code> is optional, you must specify a value for <code>path</code> when creating a <code>scope/values</code> pair.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, you can set multiple scope/values pairs for <code>defaults</code>.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "pages"
    values:
      layout: "my-site"
  -
    scope:
      path: "projects"
      type: "pages" # previously `page` in Jekyll 2.2.
    values:
      layout: "project" # overrides previous default layout
      author: "Mr. Hyde"
</pre> <p>With these defaults, all pages would use the <code>my-site</code> layout. Any html files that exist in the <code>projects/</code> folder will use the <code>project</code> layout, if it exists. Those files will also have the <code>page.author</code> <a href="../../variables/index.html">liquid variable</a> set to <code>Mr. Hyde</code>.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">collections:
  my_collection:
    output: true

defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "my_collection" # a collection in your site, in plural form
    values:
      layout: "default"
</pre> <p>In this example, the <code>layout</code> is set to <code>default</code> inside the <a href="../../collections/index.html">collection</a> with the name <code>my_collection</code>.</p> <h3 id="glob-patterns-in-front-matter-defaults">Glob patterns in Front Matter defaults</h3> <p>It is also possible to use glob patterns (currently limited to patterns that contain <code>*</code>) when matching defaults. For example, it is possible to set specific layout for each <code>special-page.html</code> in any subfolder of <code>section</code> folder.<span class="version-badge" title="This feature is available starting version 3.7.0">3.7.0</span></p> <pre data-language="yaml">collections:
  my_collection:
    output: true

defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: "section/*/special-page.html"
    values:
      layout: "specific-layout"
</pre> <blockquote class="note warning"> <h5>Globbing and Performance</h5> <p> Please note that globbing a path is known to have a negative effect on performance and is currently not optimized, especially on Windows. Globbing a path will increase your build times in proportion to the size of the associated collection directory. </p> </blockquote> <h3 id="precedence">Precedence</h3> <p>Jekyll will apply all of the configuration settings you specify in the <code>defaults</code> section of your <code>_config.yml</code> file. You can choose to override settings from other scope/values pair by specifying a more specific path for the scope.</p> <p>You can see that in the second to last example above. First, we set the default page layout to <code>my-site</code>. Then, using a more specific path, we set the default layout for pages in the <code>projects/</code> path to <code>project</code>. This can be done with any value that you would set in the page or post front matter.</p> <p>Finally, if you set defaults in the site configuration by adding a <code>defaults</code> section to your <code>_config.yml</code> file, you can override those settings in a post or page file. All you need to do is specify the settings in the post or page front matter. For example:</p> <pre data-language="yaml"># In _config.yml
...
defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: "projects"
      type: "pages"
    values:
      layout: "project"
      author: "Mr. Hyde"
      category: "project"
...
</pre> <pre data-language="yaml"># In projects/foo_project.md
---
author: "John Smith"
layout: "foobar"
---
The post text goes here...
</pre> <p>The <code>projects/foo_project.md</code> would have the <code>layout</code> set to <code>foobar</code> instead of <code>project</code> and the <code>author</code> set to <code>John Smith</code> instead of <code>Mr. Hyde</code> when the site is built.</p><div class="_attribution">
