<h1>GitHub Actions</h1> <p>When building a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages, the standard flow is restricted for security reasons and to make it simpler to get a site setup. For more control over the build and still host the site with GitHub Pages you can use GitHub Actions.</p> <h2 id="advantages-of-using-actions">Advantages of using Actions</h2> <h3 id="control-over-gemset">Control over gemset</h3> <ul> <li>
<strong>Jekyll version</strong> — Instead of using the currently enabled version at <code>3.9.0</code>, you can use any version of Jekyll you want. For example <code>4.0.0</code>, or point directly to the repository.</li> <li>
<strong>Plugins</strong> — You can use any Jekyll plugins irrespective of them being on the <a href="https://pages.github.com/versions/">supported versions</a> list, even <code>*.rb</code> files placed in the <code>_plugins</code> directory of your site.</li> <li>
<strong>Themes</strong> — While using a custom theme is possible without Actions, it is now simpler.</li> </ul> <h3 id="workflow-management">Workflow Management</h3> <ul> <li>
<strong>Customization</strong> — By creating a workflow file to run Actions, you can specify custom build steps, use environment variables.</li> <li>
<strong>Logging</strong> — The build log is visible and can be tweaked to be verbose, so it is much easier to debug errors using Actions.</li> </ul> <h2 id="workspace-setup">Workspace setup</h2> <p>The first and foremost requirement is a Jekyll project hosted at GitHub. Choose an existing Jekyll project or follow the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs">Quickstart</a> and push the repository to GitHub if it is not hosted there already.</p> <p>We’re only going to cover builds from the <code>master</code> branch in this page. Therefore, ensure that you are working on the <code>master</code> branch. If necessary, you may create it based on your default branch. When the Action builds your site, the contents of the <em>destination</em> directory will be automatically pushed to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch with a commit, ready to be used for serving.</p> <blockquote class="note warning">The Action we’re using here will create (or reset an existing) <code>gh-pages</code> branch on every successful deploy. So, if you have an existing <code>gh-pages</code> branch that is used to deploy your production build, ensure to make a backup of the contents into a different branch so that you can rollback easily if necessary.</blockquote> <p>The Jekyll site we’ll be using for the rest of this page initially consists of just a <code>_config.yml</code>, an <code>index.md</code> page and a <code>Gemfile</code>. The contents are respectively:</p> <pre data-language="yaml"># _config.yml

Welcome to My Home Page

{% assign date = '2020-04-13T10:20:00Z' %}

- Original date - {{ date }}
- With timeago filter - {{ date | timeago }}
</pre> <pre data-language="ruby"># Gemfile

source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'jekyll', '~&gt; 4.0'

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-timeago', '~&gt; 0.13.1'
end
</pre> <blockquote class="note info">The demo site uses Jekyll 4 and a <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-timeago">third-party plugin</a>, both of which are currently not whitelisted for use on GitHub pages. The plugin will allow us to describe how far back a date was from today. e.g. If we give a date as <code>2016-03-23T10:20:00Z</code> and the current date is <code>2020-04-13T10:20:00Z</code>, then the output would be <code>4 years and 3 weeks ago</code>.</blockquote> <blockquote class="note info">The action we’re using takes care of installing the Ruby gems and dependencies. While that keeps the setup simple for the user, one may encounter issues if they also check-in <code>Gemfile.lock</code> if it was generated with an old version of Bundler.</blockquote> <h3 id="setting-up-the-action">Setting up the Action</h3> <p>GitHub Actions are registered for a repository by using a YAML file inside the directory path <code>.github/workflows</code> (note the dot at the start). Here we shall employ <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-actions">Jekyll Actions</a> from the Marketplace for its simplicity.</p> <p>Create a <strong>workflow file</strong>, say <code>github-pages.yml</code>, using either the GitHub interface or by pushing a YAML file to the workflow directory path manually. The base contents are:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">name: Build and deploy Jekyll site to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  github-pages:
    runs-on: ubuntu-16.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: helaili/jekyll-action@2.0.1
        env:
          JEKYLL_PAT: ${{ secrets.JEKYLL_PAT }}
</pre> <p>The above workflow can be explained as the following:</p> <ul> <li>We trigger the build using <strong>on.push</strong> condition for <code>master</code> branch only — this prevents the Action from overwriting the <code>gh-pages</code> branch on any feature branch pushes.</li> <li>The <strong>name</strong> of the job matches our YAML filename: <code>github-pages</code>.</li> <li>The <strong>checkout</strong> action takes care of cloning your repository.</li> <li>We specify our selected <strong>action</strong> and <strong>version number</strong> using <code>helaili/jekyll-action@2.0.0</code>. This handles the build and deploy.</li> <li>We set a reference to a secret <strong>environment variable</strong> for the action to use. The <code>JEKYLL_PAT</code> is a <em>Personal Access Token</em> and is detailed in the next section.</li> </ul> <p>Instead of using the <strong>on.push</strong> condition, you could trigger your build on a <strong>schedule</strong> by using the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onschedule">on.schedule</a> parameter. For example, here we build daily at midnight by specifying <strong>cron</strong> syntax, which can be tested at the <a href="https://crontab.guru/">crontab guru</a> site.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 0 * * *'
</pre> <p>Note that this string must be quoted to prevent the asterisks from being evaluated incorrectly.</p> <h3 id="providing-permissions">Providing permissions</h3> <p>The action needs permissions to push to your <code>gh-pages</code> branch. So you need to create a GitHub <strong>authentication token</strong> on your GitHub profile, then set it as an environment variable in your build using <em>Secrets</em>:</p> <ol> <li>On your GitHub profile, under <strong>Developer Settings</strong>, go to the <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">Personal Access Tokens</a> section.</li> <li>
<strong>Create</strong> a token. Give it a name like “GitHub Actions” and ensure it has permissions to <code>public_repos</code> (or the entire <code>repo</code> scope for private repository) — necessary for the action to commit to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li> <li>
<strong>Copy</strong> the token value.</li> <li>Go to your repository’s <strong>Settings</strong> and then the <strong>Secrets</strong> tab.</li> <li>
<strong>Create</strong> a token named <code>JEKYLL_PAT</code> (<em>important</em>). Give it a value using the value copied above.</li> </ol> <h3 id="build-and-deploy">Build and deploy</h3> <p>On pushing any local changes onto <code>master</code>, the action will be triggered and the build will <strong>start</strong>.</p> <p>To watch the progress and see any build errors, check on the build <strong>status</strong> using one of the following approaches:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>View by commit</strong> <ul> <li>Go to the repository level view in GitHub. Under the most recent commit (near the top) you’ll see a <strong>status symbol</strong> next to the commit message as a tick or <em>X</em>. Hover over it and click the <strong>details</strong> link.</li> </ul> </li> <li>
<strong>Actions tab</strong> <ul> <li>Go to the repository’s Actions tab. Click on the <code>jekyll</code> workflow tab.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If all goes well, all steps will be green and the built assets will now exist on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p> <p>On a successful build, GitHub Pages will <strong>publish</strong> the site stored on the repository <code>gh-pages</code> branches. Note that you do not need to setup a <code>gh-pages</code> branch or enable GitHub Pages, as the action will take care of this for you. (For private repositories, you’ll have to upgrade to a paid plan).</p> <p>To see the <strong>live site</strong>:</p> <ol> <li>Go to the <strong>environment</strong> tab on your repository.</li> <li>Click <strong>View Deployment</strong> to see the deployed site URL.</li> <li>View your site at the <strong>URL</strong>. Make sure the <code>timeago</code> filter works as expected.</li> <li>Optionally <strong>add</strong> this URL to your repository’s main page and to your <code>README.md</code>, to make it easy for people to find.</li> </ol> <p>When you need to make further <strong>changes</strong> to the site, commit to <code>master</code> and push. The workflow will build and deploy your site again.</p> <p>Be sure <strong>not to edit</strong> the <code>gh-pages</code> branch directly, as any changes will be lost on the next successful deploy from the Action.</p> <h2 id="external-links">External links</h2> <ul> <li>
