<h1>Travis CI</h1> <p>You can test your website build against one or more versions of Ruby. The following guide will show you how to set up a free build environment on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> integration for pull requests.</p> <h2 id="1-enabling-travis-and-github">1. Enabling Travis and GitHub</h2> <p>To enable Travis builds for your GitHub repository:</p> <ol> <li>Go to your profile on travis-ci.org: https://travis-ci.org/profile/username</li> <li>Find the repository for which you’re interested in enabling builds.</li> <li>Flick the repository switch on so that it turns blue.</li> <li>Optionally configure the build by clicking on the gear icon. Further configuration happens via your <code>.travis.yml</code> file. More details below.</li> </ol> <h2 id="2-the-test-script">2. The Test Script</h2> <p>The simplest test script runs <code>jekyll build</code> and ensures that Jekyll doesn’t fail to build the site. It doesn’t check the resulting site, but it does ensure things are built properly.</p> <p>When testing Jekyll output, there is no better tool than <a href="https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer">html-proofer</a>. This tool checks your resulting site to ensure all links and images exist. Utilize it either with the convenient <code>htmlproofer</code> command-line executable, or write a Ruby script which utilizes the gem.</p> <p>Save the commands you want to run and succeed in a file: <code>./script/cibuild</code></p> <h3 id="the-html-proofer-executable">The HTML Proofer Executable</h3> <pre data-language="bash">#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e # halt script on error

bundle exec jekyll build
bundle exec htmlproofer ./_site
</pre> <p>Some options can be specified via command-line switches. Check out the <code>html-proofer</code> README for more information about these switches, or run <code>htmlproofer --help</code> locally.</p> <p>For example to avoid testing external sites, use this command:</p> <pre data-language="bash">bundle exec htmlproofer ./_site --disable-external
</pre> <h3 id="the-html-proofer-library">The HTML Proofer Library</h3> <p>You can also invoke <code>html-proofer</code> in Ruby scripts (e.g. in a Rakefile):</p> <pre data-language="ruby">#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'html-proofer'
HTMLProofer.check_directory("./_site").run
</pre> <p>Options are given as a second argument to <code>.new</code>, and are encoded in a symbol-keyed Ruby Hash. For more information about the configuration options, check out <code>html-proofer</code>’s README file.</p> <h2 id="3-configuring-your-travis-builds">3. Configuring Your Travis Builds</h2> <p>This file is used to configure your Travis builds. Because Jekyll is built with Ruby and requires RubyGems to install, we use the Ruby language build environment. Below is a sample <code>.travis.yml</code> file, followed by an explanation of each line.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will need a Gemfile as well, <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/ruby/#Dependency-Management">Travis will automatically install</a> the dependencies based on the referenced gems. Here is an example <code>Gemfile</code> with two referenced gems, “jekyll” and “html-proofer”:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "jekyll"
gem "html-proofer"
</pre> <p>Your <code>.travis.yml</code> file should look like this:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">language: ruby
rvm:
  - 2.6.3

before_script:
 - chmod +x ./script/cibuild # or do this locally and commit

# Assume bundler is being used, therefore
# the `install` step will run `bundle install` by default.
script: ./script/cibuild

# branch whitelist, only for GitHub Pages
branches:
  only:
  - gh-pages     # test the gh-pages branch
  - /pages-(.*)/ # test every branch which starts with "pages-"

addons:
  apt:
    packages:
    - libcurl4-openssl-dev

cache: bundler # caching bundler gem packages will speed up build

# Optional: disable email notifications about the outcome of your builds
notifications:
  email: false
</pre> <p>Ok, now for an explanation of each line:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">language: ruby
</pre> <p>This line tells Travis to use a Ruby build container. It gives your script access to Bundler, RubyGems, and a Ruby runtime.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">rvm:
  - 2.6.3
</pre> <p>RVM is a popular Ruby Version Manager (like rbenv, chruby, etc). This directive tells Travis the Ruby version to use when running your test script. Use a <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/ruby/#Specifying-Ruby-versions-and-implementations">version which is pre-installed on the Travis build docker</a> image to speed up the build.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">before_script:
 - chmod +x ./script/cibuild
</pre> <p>The build script file needs to have the <em>executable</em> attribute set or Travis will fail with a permission denied error. You can also run this locally and commit the permissions directly, thus rendering this step irrelevant.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">script: ./script/cibuild
</pre> <p>Travis allows you to run any arbitrary shell script to test your site. One convention is to put all scripts for your project in the <code>script</code> directory, and to call your test script <code>cibuild</code>. This line is completely customizable. If your script won’t change much, you can write your test incantation here directly:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">install: gem install jekyll html-proofer
script: jekyll build &amp;&amp; htmlproofer ./_site
</pre> <p>The <code>script</code> directive can be absolutely any valid shell command.</p> <pre data-language="yaml"># branch whitelist, only for GitHub Pages
branches:
  only:
  - gh-pages     # test the gh-pages branch
  - /pages-(.*)/ # test every branch which starts with "pages-"
</pre> <p>You want to ensure the Travis builds for your site are being run only on the branch or branches which contain your site. One means of ensuring this isolation is including a branch whitelist in your Travis configuration file. By specifying the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, you will ensure the associated test script (discussed above) is only executed on site branches. If you use a pull request flow for proposing changes, you may wish to enforce a convention for your builds such that all branches containing edits are prefixed, exemplified above with the <code>/pages-(.*)/</code> regular expression.</p> <p>The <code>branches</code> directive is completely optional. Travis will build from every push to any branch of your repo if leave it out.</p> <blockquote class="note warning"> <h5>Be sure to exclude <code>vendor</code> from your <code>_config.yml</code>
</h5> <p>Travis bundles all gems in the <code>vendor</code> directory on its build servers, which Jekyll will mistakenly read and explode on.</p> </blockquote> <pre data-language="yaml">exclude: [vendor]
</pre> <p>To speed up the build, you should cache the gem packages created by <code>bundler</code>. Travis has a pre-defined <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/#Caching-directories-(Bundler%2C-dependencies)">cache strategy for this tool</a> which should have all the default configs to do exactly that.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">cache: bundler
</pre> <p>Optionally, if you are not interested in the build email notifications you can disable them with this configuration. Travis supports a wide array of notification services, you may find <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/">another one more useful (e.g. slack)</a>.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">notifications:
  email: false
</pre> <h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3> <p><strong>Travis error:</strong> <em>“You are trying to install in deployment mode after changing your Gemfile. Run bundle install elsewhere and add the updated Gemfile.lock to version control.”</em></p> <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Either run <code>bundle install</code> locally and commit your changes to <code>Gemfile.lock</code>, or remove the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file from your repository and add an entry in the <code>.gitignore</code> file to avoid it from being checked in again.</p> <h3 id="questions">Questions?</h3> <p>This entire guide is open-source.
