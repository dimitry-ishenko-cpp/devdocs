<p>1.12</p> </dd> </dl> <p>This HOWTO discusses Python‚Äôs support for the Unicode specification for representing textual data, and explains various problems that people commonly encounter when trying to work with Unicode.</p> <section id="introduction-to-unicode"> <h2>Introduction to Unicode</h2> <section id="definitions"> <h3>Definitions</h3> <p>Today‚Äôs programs need to be able to handle a wide variety of characters. Applications are often internationalized to display messages and output in a variety of user-selectable languages; the same program might need to output an error message in English, French, Japanese, Hebrew, or Russian. Web content can be written in any of these languages and can also include a variety of emoji symbols. Python‚Äôs string type uses the Unicode Standard for representing characters, which lets Python programs work with all these different possible characters.</p> <p>Unicode (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.unicode.org/">https://www.unicode.org/</a>) is a specification that aims to list every character used by human languages and give each character its own unique code. The Unicode specifications are continually revised and updated to add new languages and symbols.</p> <p>A <strong>character</strong> is the smallest possible component of a text. ‚ÄòA‚Äô, ‚ÄòB‚Äô, ‚ÄòC‚Äô, etc., are all different characters. So are ‚Äò√à‚Äô and ‚Äò√ç‚Äô. Characters vary depending on the language or context you‚Äôre talking about. For example, there‚Äôs a character for ‚ÄúRoman Numeral One‚Äù, ‚Äò‚Ö†‚Äô, that‚Äôs separate from the uppercase letter ‚ÄòI‚Äô. They‚Äôll usually look the same, but these are two different characters that have different meanings.</p> <p>The Unicode standard describes how characters are represented by <strong>code points</strong>. A code point value is an integer in the range 0 to 0x10FFFF (about 1.1 million values, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/#Summary">actual number assigned</a> is less than that). In the standard and in this document, a code point is written using the notation <code>U+265E</code> to mean the character with value <code>0x265e</code> (9,822 in decimal).</p> <p>The Unicode standard contains a lot of tables listing characters and their corresponding code points:</p> <pre data-language="none">0061    'a'; LATIN SMALL LETTER A
0062    'b'; LATIN SMALL LETTER B
0063    'c'; LATIN SMALL LETTER C
...
007B    '{'; LEFT CURLY BRACKET
...
2167    '‚Öß'; ROMAN NUMERAL EIGHT
2168    '‚Ö®'; ROMAN NUMERAL NINE
...
265E    '‚ôû'; BLACK CHESS KNIGHT
265F    '‚ôü'; BLACK CHESS PAWN
...
1F600   'üòÄ'; GRINNING FACE
1F609   'üòâ'; WINKING FACE
...
</pre> <p>Strictly, these definitions imply that it‚Äôs meaningless to say ‚Äòthis is character <code>U+265E</code>‚Äô. <code>U+265E</code> is a code point, which represents some particular character; in this case, it represents the character ‚ÄòBLACK CHESS KNIGHT‚Äô, ‚Äò‚ôû‚Äô. In informal contexts, this distinction between code points and characters will sometimes be forgotten.</p> <p>A character is represented on a screen or on paper by a set of graphical elements that‚Äôs called a <strong>glyph</strong>. The glyph for an uppercase A, for example, is two diagonal strokes and a horizontal stroke, though the exact details will depend on the font being used. Most Python code doesn‚Äôt need to worry about glyphs; figuring out the correct glyph to display is generally the job of a GUI toolkit or a terminal‚Äôs font renderer.</p> </section> <section id="encodings"> <h3>Encodings</h3> <p>To summarize the previous section: a Unicode string is a sequence of code points, which are numbers from 0 through <code>0x10FFFF</code> (1,114,111 decimal). This sequence of code points needs to be represented in memory as a set of <strong>code units</strong>, and <strong>code units</strong> are then mapped to 8-bit bytes. The rules for translating a Unicode string into a sequence of bytes are called a <strong>character encoding</strong>, or just an <strong>encoding</strong>.</p> <p>The first encoding you might think of is using 32-bit integers as the code unit, and then using the CPU‚Äôs representation of 32-bit integers. In this representation, the string ‚ÄúPython‚Äù might look like this:</p> <pre data-language="none">   P           y           t           h           o           n
0x50 00 00 00 79 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 6f 00 00 00 6e 00 00 00
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
</pre> <p>This representation is straightforward but using it presents a number of problems.</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>It‚Äôs not portable; different processors order the bytes differently.</li> <li>It‚Äôs very wasteful of space. In most texts, the majority of the code points are less than 127, or less than 255, so a lot of space is occupied by <code>0x00</code> bytes. The above string takes 24 bytes compared to the 6 bytes needed for an ASCII representation. Increased RAM usage doesn‚Äôt matter too much (desktop computers have gigabytes of RAM, and strings aren‚Äôt usually that large), but expanding our usage of disk and network bandwidth by a factor of 4 is intolerable.</li> <li>It‚Äôs not compatible with existing C functions such as <code>strlen()</code>, so a new family of wide string functions would need to be used.</li> </ol> <p>Therefore this encoding isn‚Äôt used very much, and people instead choose other encodings that are more efficient and convenient, such as UTF-8.</p> <p>UTF-8 is one of the most commonly used encodings, and Python often defaults to using it. UTF stands for ‚ÄúUnicode Transformation Format‚Äù, and the ‚Äò8‚Äô means that 8-bit values are used in the encoding. (There are also UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings, but they are less frequently used than UTF-8.) UTF-8 uses the following rules:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>If the code point is &lt; 128, it‚Äôs represented by the corresponding byte value.</li> <li>If the code point is &gt;= 128, it‚Äôs turned into a sequence of two, three, or four bytes, where each byte of the sequence is between 128 and 255.</li> </ol> <p>UTF-8 has several convenient properties:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>It can handle any Unicode code point.</li> <li>A Unicode string is turned into a sequence of bytes that contains embedded zero bytes only where they represent the null character (U+0000). This means that UTF-8 strings can be processed by C functions such as <code>strcpy()</code> and sent through protocols that can‚Äôt handle zero bytes for anything other than end-of-string markers.</li> <li>A string of ASCII text is also valid UTF-8 text.</li> <li>UTF-8 is fairly compact; the majority of commonly used characters can be represented with one or two bytes.</li> <li>If bytes are corrupted or lost, it‚Äôs possible to determine the start of the next UTF-8-encoded code point and resynchronize. It‚Äôs also unlikely that random 8-bit data will look like valid UTF-8.</li> <li>UTF-8 is a byte oriented encoding. The encoding specifies that each character is represented by a specific sequence of one or more bytes. This avoids the byte-ordering issues that can occur with integer and word oriented encodings, like UTF-16 and UTF-32, where the sequence of bytes varies depending on the hardware on which the string was encoded.</li> </ol> </section> <section id="references"> <h3>References</h3> <p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unicode.org">Unicode Consortium site</a> has character charts, a glossary, and PDF versions of the Unicode specification.

rocks!'</code>, or the triple-quoted string syntax is stored as Unicode.</p> <p>The default encoding for Python source code is UTF-8, so you can simply include a Unicode character in a string literal:</p> <pre data-language="python">try:
    with open('/tmp/input.txt', 'r') as f:
        ...
except OSError:
    # 'File not found' error message.
    print("Fichier non trouv√©")
</pre> <p>Side note: Python 3 also supports using Unicode characters in identifiers:</p> <pre data-language="python">r√©pertoire = "/tmp/records.log"
with open(r√©pertoire, "w") as f:
    f.write("test\n")
</pre> <p>If you can‚Äôt enter a particular character in your editor or want to keep the source code ASCII-only for some reason, you can also use escape sequences in string literals. (Depending on your system, you may see the actual capital-delta glyph instead of a u escape.)</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; "\N{GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA}"  # Using the character name
'\u0394'
&gt;&gt;&gt; "\u0394"                          # Using a 16-bit hex value
'\u0394'
&gt;&gt;&gt; "\U00000394"                      # Using a 32-bit hex value
'\u0394'
</pre> <p>In addition, one can create a string using the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode" title="bytes.decode"><code>decode()</code></a> method of <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#bytes" title="bytes"><code>bytes</code></a>. This method takes an <em>encoding</em> argument, such as <code>UTF-8</code>, and optionally an <em>errors</em> argument.</p> <p>The <em>errors</em> argument specifies the response when the input string can‚Äôt be converted according to the encoding‚Äôs rules. Legal values for this argument are <code>'strict'</code> (raise a <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions.html#UnicodeDecodeError" title="UnicodeDecodeError"><code>UnicodeDecodeError</code></a> exception), <code>'replace'</code> (use <code>U+FFFD</code>, <code>REPLACEMENT CHARACTER</code>), <code>'ignore'</code> (just leave the character out of the Unicode result), or <code>'backslashreplace'</code> (inserts a <code>\xNN</code> escape sequence). The following examples show the differences:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; b'\x80abc'.decode("utf-8", "strict")  
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0:

&gt;&gt;&gt; b'\x80abc'.decode("utf-8", "backslashreplace")
'\\x80abc'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b'\x80abc'.decode("utf-8", "ignore")
'abc'
</pre> <p>Encodings are specified as strings containing the encoding‚Äôs name. Python comes with roughly 100 different encodings; see the Python Library Reference at <a class="reference internal" href="../library/codecs.html#standard-encodings"><span class="std std-ref">Standard Encodings</span></a> for a list. Some encodings have multiple names; for example, <code>'latin-1'</code>, <code>'iso_8859_1'</code> and <code>'8859</code>‚Äô are all synonyms for the same encoding.</p> <p>One-character Unicode strings can also be created with the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#chr" title="chr"><code>chr()</code></a> built-in function, which takes integers and returns a Unicode string of length 1 that contains the corresponding code point. The reverse operation is the built-in <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#ord" title="ord"><code>ord()</code></a> function that takes a one-character Unicode string and returns the code point value:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; chr(57344)
'\ue000'
&gt;&gt;&gt; ord('\ue000')
57344

As well as <code>'strict'</code>, <code>'ignore'</code>, and <code>'replace'</code> (which in this case inserts a question mark instead of the unencodable character), there is also <code>'xmlcharrefreplace'</code> (inserts an XML character reference), <code>backslashreplace</code> (inserts a <code>\uNNNN</code> escape sequence) and <code>namereplace</code> (inserts a <code>\N{...}</code> escape sequence).</p> <p>The following example shows the different results:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; u = chr(40960) + 'abcd' + chr(1972)
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.encode('utf-8')
b'\xea\x80\x80abcd\xde\xb4'

</pre> <p>The low-level routines for registering and accessing the available encodings are found in the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/codecs.html#module-codecs" title="codecs: Encode and decode data and streams."><code>codecs</code></a> module. Implementing new encodings also requires understanding the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/codecs.html#module-codecs" title="codecs: Encode and decode data and streams."><code>codecs</code></a> module. However, the encoding and decoding functions returned by this module are usually more low-level than is comfortable, and writing new encodings is a specialized task, so the module won‚Äôt be covered in this HOWTO.</p> </section> <section id="unicode-literals-in-python-source-code"> <h3>Unicode Literals in Python Source Code</h3> <p>In Python source code, specific Unicode code points can be written using the <code>\u</code> escape sequence, which is followed by four hex digits giving the code point. The <code>\U</code> escape sequence is similar, but expects eight hex digits, not four:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "a\xac\u1234\u20ac\U00008000"
... #     ^^^^ two-digit hex escape
... #         ^^^^^^ four-digit Unicode escape
... #                     ^^^^^^^^^^ eight-digit Unicode escape
&gt;&gt;&gt; [ord(c) for c in s]
[97, 172, 4660, 8364, 32768]
</pre> <p>Using escape sequences for code points greater than 127 is fine in small doses, but becomes an annoyance if you‚Äôre using many accented characters, as you would in a program with messages in French or some other accent-using language. You can also assemble strings using the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#chr" title="chr"><code>chr()</code></a> built-in function, but this is even more tedious.</p> <p>Ideally, you‚Äôd want to be able to write literals in your language‚Äôs natural encoding. You could then edit Python source code with your favorite editor which would display the accented characters naturally, and have the right characters used at runtime.</p> <p>Python supports writing source code in UTF-8 by default, but you can use almost any encoding if you declare the encoding being used. This is done by including a special comment as either the first or second line of the source file:</p> <pre data-language="python">#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: latin-1 -*-

u = 'abcd√©'
print(ord(u[-1]))
</pre> <p>The syntax is inspired by Emacs‚Äôs notation for specifying variables local to a file. Emacs supports many different variables, but Python only supports ‚Äòcoding‚Äô. The <code>-*-</code> symbols indicate to Emacs that the comment is special; they have no significance to Python but are a convention. Python looks for <code>coding: name</code> or <code>coding=name</code> in the comment.</p> <p>If you don‚Äôt include such a comment, the default encoding used will be UTF-8 as already mentioned. See also <span class="target" id="index-0"></span><a class="pep reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0263/"><strong>PEP 263</strong></a> for more information.</p> </section> <section id="unicode-properties"> <h3>Unicode Properties</h3> <p>The Unicode specification includes a database of information about code points. For each defined code point, the information includes the character‚Äôs name, its category, the numeric value if applicable (for characters representing numeric concepts such as the Roman numerals, fractions such as one-third and four-fifths, etc.). There are also display-related properties, such as how to use the code point in bidirectional text.</p> <p>The following program displays some information about several characters, and prints the numeric value of one particular character:</p> <pre data-language="python">import unicodedata

u = chr(233) + chr(0x0bf2) + chr(3972) + chr(6000) + chr(13231)

for i, c in enumerate(u):
    print(i, '%04x' % ord(c), unicodedata.category(c), end=" ")
    print(unicodedata.name(c))

# Get numeric value of second character
print(unicodedata.numeric(u[1]))
</pre> <p>When run, this prints:</p> <pre data-language="none">0 00e9 Ll LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE

</pre> <p>The category codes are abbreviations describing the nature of the character. These are grouped into categories such as ‚ÄúLetter‚Äù, ‚ÄúNumber‚Äù, ‚ÄúPunctuation‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSymbol‚Äù, which in turn are broken up into subcategories. To take the codes from the above output, <code>'Ll'</code> means ‚ÄòLetter, lowercase‚Äô, <code>'No'</code> means ‚ÄúNumber, other‚Äù, <code>'Mn'</code> is ‚ÄúMark, nonspacing‚Äù, and <code>'So'</code> is ‚ÄúSymbol, other‚Äù.

For example, a letter like ‚Äò√™‚Äô can be represented as a single code point U+00EA, or as U+0065 U+0302, which is the code point for ‚Äòe‚Äô followed by a code point for ‚ÄòCOMBINING CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT‚Äô. These will produce the same output when printed, but one is a string of length 1 and the other is of length 2.</p> <p>One tool for a case-insensitive comparison is the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#str.casefold" title="str.casefold"><code>casefold()</code></a> string method that converts a string to a case-insensitive form following an algorithm described by the Unicode Standard. This algorithm has special handling for characters such as the German letter ‚Äò√ü‚Äô (code point U+00DF), which becomes the pair of lowercase letters ‚Äòss‚Äô.</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; street = 'G√ºrzenichstra√üe'

single_char = '√™'
multiple_chars = '\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E}\N{COMBINING CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT}'

print(compare_caseless(single_char, multiple_chars))
</pre> <p>This will print <code>True</code>. (Why is <code>NFD()</code> invoked twice? Because there are a few characters that make <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#str.casefold" title="str.casefold"><code>casefold()</code></a> return a non-normalized string, so the result needs to be normalized again.

XML parsers often return Unicode data, for example. Many relational databases also support Unicode-valued columns and can return Unicode values from an SQL query.</p> <p>Unicode data is usually converted to a particular encoding before it gets written to disk or sent over a socket. It‚Äôs possible to do all the work yourself: open a file, read an 8-bit bytes object from it, and convert the bytes with <code>bytes.decode(encoding)</code>. However, the manual approach is not recommended.</p> <p>One problem is the multi-byte nature of encodings; one Unicode character can be represented by several bytes. If you want to read the file in arbitrary-sized chunks (say, 1024 or 4096 bytes), you need to write error-handling code to catch the case where only part of the bytes encoding a single Unicode character are read at the end of a chunk. One solution would be to read the entire file into memory and then perform the decoding, but that prevents you from working with files that are extremely large; if you need to read a 2 GiB file, you need 2 GiB of RAM. (More, really, since for at least a moment you‚Äôd need to have both the encoded string and its Unicode version in memory.)</p> <p>The solution would be to use the low-level decoding interface to catch the case of partial coding sequences. The work of implementing this has already been done for you: the built-in <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#open" title="open"><code>open()</code></a> function can return a file-like object that assumes the file‚Äôs contents are in a specified encoding and accepts Unicode parameters for methods such as <a class="reference internal" href="../library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.read" title="io.TextIOBase.read"><code>read()</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.write" title="io.TextIOBase.write"><code>write()</code></a>. This works through <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#open" title="open"><code>open()</code></a>'s <em>encoding</em> and <em>errors</em> parameters which are interpreted just like those in <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#str.encode" title="str.encode"><code>str.encode()</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode" title="bytes.decode"><code>bytes.decode()</code></a>.</p> <p>Reading Unicode from a file is therefore simple:</p> <pre data-language="python">with open('unicode.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(repr(line))
</pre> <p>It‚Äôs also possible to open files in update mode, allowing both reading and writing:</p> <pre data-language="python">with open('test', encoding='utf-8', mode='w+') as f:
    f.write('\u4500 blah blah blah\n')
    f.seek(0)
    print(repr(f.readline()[:1]))
</pre> <p>The Unicode character <code>U+FEFF</code> is used as a byte-order mark (BOM), and is often written as the first character of a file in order to assist with autodetection of the file‚Äôs byte ordering. Some encodings, such as UTF-16, expect a BOM to be present at the start of a file; when such an encoding is used, the BOM will be automatically written as the first character and will be silently dropped when the file is read. There are variants of these encodings, such as ‚Äòutf-16-le‚Äô and ‚Äòutf-16-be‚Äô for little-endian and big-endian encodings, that specify one particular byte ordering and don‚Äôt skip the BOM.</p> <p>In some areas, it is also convention to use a ‚ÄúBOM‚Äù at the start of UTF-8 encoded files; the name is misleading since UTF-8 is not byte-order dependent. The mark simply announces that the file is encoded in UTF-8. For reading such files, use the ‚Äòutf-8-sig‚Äô codec to automatically skip the mark if present.</p> <section id="unicode-filenames"> <h3>Unicode filenames</h3> <p>Most of the operating systems in common use today support filenames that contain arbitrary Unicode characters. Usually this is implemented by converting the Unicode string into some encoding that varies depending on the system. Today Python is converging on using UTF-8: Python on MacOS has used UTF-8 for several versions, and Python 3.6 switched to using UTF-8 on Windows as well. On Unix systems, there will only be a <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-filesystem-encoding-and-error-handler"><span class="xref std std-term">filesystem encoding</span></a>. if you‚Äôve set the <code>LANG</code> or <code>LC_CTYPE</code> environment variables; if you haven‚Äôt, the default encoding is again UTF-8.</p> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/sys.html#sys.getfilesystemencoding" title="sys.getfilesystemencoding"><code>sys.getfilesystemencoding()</code></a> function returns the encoding to use on your current system, in case you want to do the encoding manually, but there‚Äôs not much reason to bother. When opening a file for reading or writing, you can usually just provide the Unicode string as the filename, and it will be automatically converted to the right encoding for you:</p> <pre data-language="python">filename = 'filename\u4500abc'
with open(filename, 'w') as f:
    f.write('blah\n')
</pre> <p>Functions in the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/os.html#module-os" title="os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces."><code>os</code></a> module such as <a class="reference internal" href="../library/os.html#os.stat" title="os.stat"><code>os.stat()</code></a> will also accept Unicode filenames.</p> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/os.html#os.listdir" title="os.listdir"><code>os.listdir()</code></a> function returns filenames, which raises an issue: should it return the Unicode version of filenames, or should it return bytes containing the encoded versions? <a class="reference internal" href="../library/os.html#os.listdir" title="os.listdir"><code>os.listdir()</code></a> can do both, depending on whether you provided the directory path as bytes or a Unicode string. If you pass a Unicode string as the path, filenames will be decoded using the filesystem‚Äôs encoding and a list of Unicode strings will be returned, while passing a byte path will return the filenames as bytes. For example, assuming the default <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-filesystem-encoding-and-error-handler"><span class="xref std std-term">filesystem encoding</span></a> is UTF-8, running the following program:</p> <pre data-language="python">fn = 'filename\u4500abc'
f = open(fn, 'w')
f.close()

import os
print(os.listdir(b'.'))
print(os.listdir('.'))
</pre> <p>will produce the following output:</p> <pre data-language="shell">$ python listdir-test.py
[b'filename\xe4\x94\x80abc', ...]
['filename\u4500abc', ...]
</pre> <p>The first list contains UTF-8-encoded filenames, and the second list contains the Unicode versions.</p> <p>Note that on most occasions, you should can just stick with using Unicode with these APIs. The bytes APIs should only be used on systems where undecodable file names can be present; that‚Äôs pretty much only Unix systems now.</p> </section> <section id="tips-for-writing-unicode-aware-programs"> <h3>Tips for Writing Unicode-aware Programs</h3> <p>This section provides some suggestions on writing software that deals with Unicode.</p> <p>The most important tip is:</p>  <p>Software should only work with Unicode strings internally, decoding the input data as soon as possible and encoding the output only at the end.</p>  <p>If you attempt to write processing functions that accept both Unicode and byte strings, you will find your program vulnerable to bugs wherever you combine the two different kinds of strings. There is no automatic encoding or decoding: if you do e.g. <code>str + bytes</code>, a <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions.html#TypeError" title="TypeError"><code>TypeError</code></a> will be raised.</p> <p>When using data coming from a web browser or some other untrusted source, a common technique is to check for illegal characters in a string before using the string in a generated command line or storing it in a database. If you‚Äôre doing this, be careful to check the decoded string, not the encoded bytes data; some encodings may have interesting properties, such as not being bijective or not being fully ASCII-compatible. This is especially true if the input data also specifies the encoding, since the attacker can then choose a clever way to hide malicious text in the encoded bytestream.</p> <section id="converting-between-file-encodings"> <h4>Converting Between File Encodings</h4> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/codecs.html#codecs.StreamRecoder" title="codecs.StreamRecoder"><code>StreamRecoder</code></a> class can transparently convert between encodings, taking a stream that returns data in encoding #1 and behaving like a stream returning data in encoding #2.</p> <p>For example, if you have an input file <em>f</em> that‚Äôs in Latin-1, you can wrap it with a <a class="reference internal" href="../library/codecs.html#codecs.StreamRecoder" title="codecs.StreamRecoder"><code>StreamRecoder</code></a> to return bytes encoded in UTF-8:</p> <pre data-language="python">new_f = codecs.StreamRecoder(f,
    # en/decoder: used by read() to encode its results and
    # by write() to decode its input.
    codecs.getencoder('utf-8'), codecs.getdecoder('utf-8'),

    # reader/writer: used to read and write to the stream.
    codecs.getreader('latin-1'), codecs.getwriter('latin-1') )
</pre> </section> <section id="files-in-an-unknown-encoding"> <h4>Files in an Unknown Encoding</h4> <p>What can you do if you need to make a change to a file, but don‚Äôt know the file‚Äôs encoding? If you know the encoding is ASCII-compatible and only want to examine or modify the ASCII parts, you can open the file with the <code>surrogateescape</code> error handler:</p> <pre data-language="python">with open(fname, 'r', encoding="ascii", errors="surrogateescape") as f:
    data = f.read()

# make changes to the string 'data'

with open(fname + '.new', 'w',
          encoding="ascii", errors="surrogateescape") as f:
    f.write(data)
</pre> <p>The <code>surrogateescape</code> error handler will decode any non-ASCII bytes as code points in a special range running from U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These code points will then turn back into the same bytes when the <code>surrogateescape</code> error handler is used to encode the data and write it back out.</p> </section> </section> <section id="id3"> <h3>References</h3> <p>One section of <a class="reference external" href="https://pyvideo.org/video/289/pycon-2010--mastering-python-3-i-o">Mastering Python 3 Input/Output</a>, a PyCon 2010 talk by David Beazley, discusses text processing and binary data handling.</p> <p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://downloads.egenix.com/python/LSM2005-Developing-Unicode-aware-applications-in-Python.pdf">PDF slides for Marc-Andr√© Lemburg‚Äôs presentation ‚ÄúWriting Unicode-aware Applications in Python‚Äù</a> discuss questions of character encodings as well as how to internationalize and localize an application.
