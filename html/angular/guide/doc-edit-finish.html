  <h1 id="finish-up-a-documentation-pull-request">Finish up a documentation pull request</h1>  <p>This topic describes how to keep your workspace tidy after your pull request is merged and closed.</p> <h2 id="review-the-commit-log-of-the-upstream-repo">Review the commit log of the upstream repo</h2> <p>This procedure confirms that your commit is now in the <code>main</code> branch of the <code>angular/angular</code> repo.</p> <h4 id="to-review-the-commit-log-on-githubcom-for-your-commit">To review the commit log on <code>github.com</code> for your commit</h4> <p>In a web browser, open <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/commits/main"><code>https://github.com/angular/angular/commits/main</code></a>.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Review the commit list.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Find the entry with your GitHub username, commit message, and pull request number of your commit. The commit number might not match the commit from your working branch because of how commits are merged.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you see your commit listed, your commit has been merged into <code>angular/angular</code> and you can continue cleaning up your workspace.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you don't see your commit in the list, you might need to wait before you retry this step.

It might be tempting to keep it around, just in case, but it is probably not necessary. If you keep all your old working branches, your repository can collect unnecessary clutter.</p> <h4 id="to-delete-your-working-branch">To delete your working branch</h4> <ol> <li> <p>From your <a href="doc-prepare-to-edit.html#create-a-git-workspace-on-your-local-computer">workspace</a> directory, run this command to navigate to your <a href="doc-prepare-to-edit.html#doc-working-directory">working directory</a>.
