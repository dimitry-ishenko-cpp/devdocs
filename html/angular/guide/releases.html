  <h1 id="angular-versioning-and-releases">Angular versioning and releases</h1> <p>We recognize that you need stability from the Angular framework. Stability ensures that reusable components and libraries, tutorials, tools, and learned practices don't become obsolete unexpectedly. Stability is essential for the ecosystem around Angular to thrive.</p> <p>We also share with you the need for Angular to keep evolving. We strive to ensure that the foundation on top of which you are building is continuously improving and enabling you to stay up-to-date with the rest of the web ecosystem and your user needs.</p> <p>This document contains the practices that we follow to provide you with a leading-edge application development platform, balanced with stability. We strive to ensure that future changes are always introduced in a predictable way. We want everyone who depends on Angular to know when and how new features are added, and to be well-prepared when obsolete ones are removed.</p> <blockquote class="alert is-helpful"> <p>The practices described in this document apply to Angular 2.0 and later. If you are currently using AngularJS, see <a href="upgrade.html" title="Upgrading from Angular JS">Upgrading from AngularJS</a>. <em>AngularJS</em> is the name for all v1.x versions of Angular.</p> </blockquote>  <h2 id="angular-versioning">Angular versioning</h2> <p>Angular version numbers indicate the level of changes that are introduced by the release. This use of <a href="https://semver.org/" title="Semantic Versioning Specification">semantic versioning</a> helps you understand the potential impact of updating to a new version.</p> <p>Angular version numbers have three parts: <code>major.minor.patch</code>. For example, version 7.2.11 indicates major version 7, minor version 2, and patch level 11.</p> <p>The version number is incremented based on the level of change included in the release.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="left">Level of change</th> <th align="left">Details</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left">Major release</td> <td align="left">Contains significant new features, some but minimal developer assistance is expected during the update. When updating to a new major release, you might need to run update scripts, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">Minor release</td> <td align="left">Contains new smaller features. Minor releases are fully backward-compatible; no developer assistance is expected during update, but you can optionally modify your applications and libraries to begin using new APIs, features, and capabilities that were added in the release. We update peer dependencies in minor versions by expanding the supported versions, but we do not require projects to update these dependencies.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">Patch release</td> <td align="left">Low risk, bug fix release. No developer assistance is expected during update.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote class="alert is-helpful"> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  As of Angular version 7, the major versions of Angular core and the CLI are aligned. This means that in order to use the CLI as you develop an Angular app, the version of <code>@angular/core</code> and the CLI need to be the same.</p> </blockquote>  <h3 id="supported-update-paths">Supported update paths</h3> <p>You can <code>ng update</code> to any version of Angular, provided that the following criteria are met:</p> <ul> <li>The version you want to update <em>to</em> is supported.</li> <li>The version you want to update <em>from</em> is within one major version of the version you want to upgrade to.</li> </ul> <p>For example, you can update from version 11 to version 12, provided that version 12 is still supported. If you want to update across multiple major versions, perform each update one major version at a time. For example, to update from version 10 to version 12:</p> <ol> <li>Update from version 10 to version 11.</li> <li>Update from version 11 to version 12.</li> </ol> <p>See <a href="updating.html" title="Updating your projects">Keeping Up-to-Date</a> for more information about updating your Angular projects to the most recent version.</p>  <h3 id="preview-releases">Preview releases</h3> <p>We let you preview what's coming by providing "Next" and Release Candidates (<code>rc</code>) pre-releases for each major and minor release:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="left">Pre-release type</th> <th align="left">Details</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left">Next</td> <td align="left">The release that is under active development and testing.

After that, deprecated APIs and features are candidates for removal. A deprecation can be announced in any release, but the removal of a deprecated API or feature happens only in major release. Until a deprecated API or feature is removed, it is maintained according to the LTS support policy, meaning that only critical and security issues are fixed.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">npm dependencies</td> <td align="left">We only make npm dependency updates that require changes to your applications in a major release. In minor releases, we update peer dependencies by expanding the supported versions, but we do not require projects to update these dependencies until a future major version. This means that during minor Angular releases, npm dependency updates within Angular applications and libraries are optional.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <h2 id="public-api-surface">Public API surface</h2> <p>Angular is a collection of many packages, subprojects, and tools. To prevent accidental use of private APIs and so that you can clearly understand what is covered by the practices described here — we document what is and is not considered our public API surface. For details, see <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/docs/PUBLIC_API.md" title="Supported Public API Surface of Angular">Supported Public API Surface of Angular</a>.</p> <p>Any changes to the public API surface are done using the versioning, support, and depreciation policies previously described.</p>  <h2 id="developer-preview">Developer Preview</h2> <p>Occasionally we introduce new APIs under the label of "Developer Preview". These are APIs that are fully functional and polished, but that we are not ready to stabilize under our normal deprecation policy.</p> <p>This may be because we want to gather feedback from real applications before stabilization, or because the associated documentation or migration tooling is not fully complete.</p> <p>The policies and practices that are described in this document do not apply to APIs marked as Developer Preview. Such APIs can change at any time, even in new patch versions of the framework. Teams should decide for themselves whether the benefits of using Developer Preview APIs are worth the risk of breaking changes outside of our normal use of semantic versioning.</p> <h2 id="experimental">Experimental</h2> <p>These are APIs might not become stable at all or have significant changes before becoming stable.</p> <p>The policies and practices that are described in this document do not apply to APIs marked as experimental. Such APIs can change at any time, even in new patch versions of the framework. Teams should decide for themselves whether the benefits of using experimental APIs are worth the risk of breaking changes outside of our normal use of semantic versioning.</p>    <div class="reviewed">Last reviewed on Wed Dec 13 2023</div><div class="_attribution">
