  <h1 id="build-and-test-a-documentation-update">Build and test a documentation update</h1>   <p>After you have completed your documentation update, you want to run the documentation's end-to-end tests on your local computer. These tests are some of the tests that are run after you open a pull request. You can find end-to-end test failures faster when you run them on your local computer than after you open a pull request.</p> <h2 id="build-the-documentation-on-your-local-computer">Build the documentation on your local computer</h2> <p>Before you test your updated documentation, you want to build it to make sure you test your latest changes.</p> <h4 id="to-build-the-documentation-on-your-local-computer">To build the documentation on your local computer</h4>  <p>Perform these steps from a command-line tool on your local computer or in the <strong>terminal</strong> pane of your IDE.</p>  <ol> <li> <p>Navigate to your <a href="doc-prepare-to-edit.html#doc-working-directory">working directory</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>From your working directory, run this command to navigate to the <code>aio</code> directory. The <code>aio</code> directory contains Angular's documentation files and tools.</p> <pre data-language="shell">cd aio</pre> </li> <li> <p>Run this command to build the documentation locally.</p> <pre data-language="shell">yarn build</pre> <p>This builds the documentation from scratch.</p> </li> </ol> <p>After you build the documentation on your local computer, you can run the angular.io end-to-end test.</p> <h2 id="run-the-angulario-end-to-end-test-on-your-local-computer">Run the angular.io end-to-end test on your local computer</h2> <p>This procedure runs most, but not all, of the tests that are run after you open a pull request.</p> <h4 id="to-run-the-angulario-end-to-end-test-on-your-local-computer">To run the angular.io end-to-end test on your local computer</h4> <p>On your local computer, in a command line tool or the <strong>Terminal</strong> pane of your IDE:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Run this command from your <a href="doc-prepare-to-edit.html#create-a-git-workspace-on-your-local-computer">workspace</a> directory to navigate to your <a href="doc-prepare-to-edit.html#doc-working-directory">working directory</a>.</p> <pre format="shell" data-language="shell">cd personal/angular</pre> </li> <li> <p>Replace <code>working-branch</code> with the name of your <code>working</code> branch and run this command to check out your <code>working</code> branch.</p> <pre format="shell" data-language="shell">git checkout working-branch</pre> </li> <li> <p>Run this command to navigate to the documentation.</p> <pre format="shell" data-language="shell">cd aio</pre> </li> <li> <p>Run these commands to run the end-to-end tests.</p> <pre format="shell" data-language="shell">yarn e2e

The tests that GitHub runs include the end-to-end tests that you just ran and other tests that only run in the GitHub repo. Because of that, even though your update passed the end-to-end tests locally, your update could still report an error after you open a pull request.</p> <h2 id="errors-reported">Errors reported</h2> <p>If the end-to-end tests report an error on your local computer, be sure to correct it before you open a pull request. If the update fails the end-to-end test locally, it is likely to also fail the tests that run after you open a pull request.</p>    <div class="reviewed">Last reviewed on Wed Oct 12 2022</div><div class="_attribution">
