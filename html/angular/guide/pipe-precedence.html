  <h1 id="pipe-precedence-in-template-expressions">Pipe precedence in template expressions</h1> <p>Sometimes you want to choose between two values, based on some condition, before passing the choice to the pipe. You could use the JavaScript ternary operator (<code>?:</code>) in the template to make that choice.</p> <p>Beware! The pipe operator has a higher precedence than the JavaScript ternary operator (<code>?:</code>).</p> <p>If you simply write the expression as if it were evaluated left-to-right, you might be surprised by the result. For example, </p> <pre>condition ? a : b | pipe</pre> <p>is parsed as </p> <pre>condition ? a : (b | pipe)</pre> <p>The value of <code>b</code> passes through <code>pipe</code>; the value of <code>a</code> <em>will not</em>.</p> <p>If you want the pipe to apply to the result of the ternary expression, wrap the entire expression in parentheses. For example, </p> <pre>(condition ? a : b) | pipe</pre> <p>In general, you should always use parentheses to be sure Angular evaluates the expression as you intend.</p> <p>The "Pipes and Precedence" section of the <span nodownload="">pipes example</span> explores this issue in more detail.</p> <div class="reviewed">Last reviewed on Mon Aug 14 2023</div><div class="_attribution">
