  <h1 id="getting-started-with-the-angular-clis-new-build-system">Getting started with the Angular CLI's new build system</h1> <p>In v17 and higher, the new build system provides an improved way to build Angular applications. This new build system includes:</p> <ul> <li>A modern output format using ESM, with dynamic import expressions to support lazy module loading.</li> <li>Faster build-time performance for both initial builds and incremental rebuilds.</li> <li>Newer JavaScript ecosystem tools such as <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> and <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>.</li> <li>Integrated SSR and prerendering capabilites</li> </ul> <p>This new build system is stable and fully supported for use with Angular applications. You can migrate to the new build system with applications that use the <code><a href="../api/animations/browser.html" class="code-anchor">browser</a></code> builder. If using a custom builder, please refer to the documentation for that builder on possible migration options.</p> <blockquote class="alert is-important"> <p>The existing Webpack-based build system is still considered stable and fully supported. Applications can continue to use the <code><a href="../api/animations/browser.html" class="code-anchor">browser</a></code> builder and will not be automatically migrated when updating.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="for-new-applications">For new applications</h2> <p>New applications will use this new build system by default via the <code>application</code> builder.</p> <h2 id="for-existing-applications">For existing applications</h2> <p>For existing projects, you can opt-in to use the new builder on a per-application basis with two different options. Both options are considered stable and fully supported by the Angular team. The choice of which option to use is a factor of how many changes you will need to make to migrate and what new features you would like to use in the project.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="left">Builder</th> <th align="left">Configuration Changes</th> <th align="left">Code Changes</th> <th align="left">Integrated SSR</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left"><code>application</code></td> <td align="left">Multiple option changes required.

However it requires a little more migration effort, particularly for existing SSR applications. If the <code>application</code> builder is difficult for your project to adopt, <code>browser-esbuild</code> can be an easier solution which gives most of the build performance benefits with fewer breaking changes.</p> <h3 id="using-the-browser-esbuild-builder">Using the <code>browser-esbuild</code> builder</h3> <p>A builder named <code>browser-esbuild</code> is available within the <code>@angular-devkit/build-angular</code> package that is present in an Angular CLI generated application. The builder is a drop-in replacement for the existing <code><a href="../api/animations/browser.html" class="code-anchor">browser</a></code> builder that provides the preexisting browser application build system.</p> <p>The compatiblity option was implemented to minimize the amount of changes necessary to initially migrate your applications. This is provided via an alternate builder (<code>browser-esbuild</code>). You can update the <code>build</code> target for any application target to migrate to the new build system.</p> <p>The following is what you would typically find in <code>angular.json</code> for an application:</p> <pre data-language="json">...
"architect": {
  "build": {
    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
...</pre> <p>Changing the <code>builder</code> field is the only change you will need to make.</p> <pre data-language="json">...
"architect": {
  "build": {
    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild",
...</pre> <h3 id="using-the-application-builder">Using the <code>application</code> builder</h3> <p>A builder named <code>application</code> is also available within the <code>@angular-devkit/build-angular</code> package that is present in an Angular CLI generated application. This builder is the default for all new applications created via <code>ng new</code>.</p> <p>The following is what you would typically find in <code>angular.json</code> for an application:</p> <pre data-language="json">...
"architect": {
  "build": {
    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
...</pre> <p>Changing the <code>builder</code> field is the first change you will need to make.</p> <pre data-language="json">...
"architect": {
  "build": {
    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:application",
...</pre> <p>Once the builder name has been changed, options within the <code>build</code> target will need to be updated. The following table lists all the <code><a href="../api/animations/browser.html" class="code-anchor">browser</a></code> builder options that will need to be adjusted or removed.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="left">
<code><a href="../api/animations/browser.html" class="code-anchor">browser</a></code> Option</th> <th align="left">Action</th> <th align="left">Notes</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left"><code>main</code></td> <td align="left">rename option to <code><a href="../api/animations/browser.html" class="code-anchor">browser</a></code>

<code>serviceWorker</code> is now either <code>false</code> or a configuration path</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>If the application is not using SSR currently, this should be the final step to allow <code>ng build</code> to function. After executing <code>ng build</code> for the first time, there may be new warnings or errors based on behavioral differences or application usage of Webpack-specific features. Many of the warnings will provide suggestions on how to remedy that problem. If it appears that a warning is incorrect or the solution is not apparent, please open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues">GitHub</a>. Also, the later sections of this guide provide additional information on several specific cases as well as current known issues.</p> <p>For applications new to SSR, the <a href="ssr.html">Angular SSR Guide</a> provides additional information regarding the setup process for adding SSR to an application.</p> <p>For applications that are already using SSR, additional manual adjustments will be needed to update the application server to support the new integrated SSR capabilities. The <code>application</code> builder now provides the integrated functionality for all of the following preexisting builders:</p> <ul> <li><code>app-shell</code></li> <li><code>prerender</code></li> <li><code>server</code></li> <li><code>ssr-dev-server</code></li> </ul> <p>The <code>ng update</code> process will automatically remove usages of the <code>@nguniversal</code> scope packages where some of these builders were previously located. The new <code>@angular/ssr</code> package will also be automatically added and used with configuration and code being adjusted during the update. The <code>@angular/ssr</code> package supports the <code><a href="../api/animations/browser.html" class="code-anchor">browser</a></code> builder as well as the <code>application</code> builder. To convert from the separate SSR builders to the integrated capabilities of the <code>application</code> builder, there are several required manual steps. However, as each application is different, there may be more application specific changes needed beyond these to complete the process.</p> <ol> <li>Combine the options for the above mentioned SSR builders into the <code>application</code> builder options within the <code>angular.json</code> file. The previously used builders and their target configurations can then be fully removed from the file.</li> <li>Combine server TypeScript configuration from <code>tsconfig.server.json</code> into <code>tsconfig.app.json</code>. The <code>types</code> and <code>files</code> options are typically the only setting that needs to be combined but others may be needed based on application specific customizations. You should also add the TypeScript option <code>"esModuleInterop": true</code> to ensure <code>express</code> imports are <a href="esbuild.html#esm-default-imports-vs-namespace-imports">ESM compliant</a>. The <code>tsconfig.server.json</code> can then be removed as it will no longer be used during builds.</li> <li>Remove and/or update any <code>npm</code> scripts referencing the now removed builder targets. The <code>ng build</code> and <code>ng serve</code> commands provide equivalent functionality when using the <code>application</code> builder.</li> <li>Update application server code to remove Webpack specific elements.</li> <li>Update application server code to use new bootstrapping and output directory structure. An example of the changes for a v16 project that has been converted can be found <a href="https://github.com/alan-agius4/angular-cli-use-application-builder/commit/1defdb93a7f508662bc427439e51505668bf84cd#diff-1ba718c1eb8aa39cd20c2562d92523068c734d75f54655e97d652b992d9b4259">here</a>.</li> <li>Remove any CommonJS assumptions in the application server code such as <code>require</code>, <code>__filename</code>, <code>__dirname</code>, or other constructs from the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#the-module-scope">CommonJS module scope</a>. All application code should be ESM compatible. This does not apply to third-party dependencies.</li> </ol> <p>In the future, a schematic will make this migration process easier for existing applications.</p> <h2 id="executing-a-build">Executing a build</h2> <p>Once you have updated the application configuration, builds can be performed using the <code>ng build</code> as was previously done. Depending on the choice of builder migration, some of the command line options may be different. If the build command is contained in any <code>npm</code> or other scripts, ensure they are reviewed and updated. For applications that have migrated to the <code>application</code> builder and that use SSR and/or prererending, you also may be able to remove extra <code>ng run</code> commands from scripts now that <code>ng build</code> has integrated SSR support.</p> <pre data-language="shell">ng build</pre> <h2 id="starting-the-development-server">Starting the development server</h2> <p>The development server will automatically detect the new build system and use it to build the application. To start the development server no changes are necessary to the <code>dev-server</code> builder configuration or command line.</p> <pre data-language="shell">ng serve</pre> <p>You can continue to use the <a href="https://angular.io/cli/serve">command line options</a> you have used in the past with the development server.</p> <blockquote class="alert is-important"> <p>JavaScript-based Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is currently not supported. However, global stylesheet (<code>styles</code> build option) HMR is available and enabled by default. Angular focused HMR capabilities are currently planned and will be introduced in a future version.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="unimplemented-options-and-behavior">Unimplemented options and behavior</h2> <p>Several build options are not yet implemented but will be added in the future as the build system moves towards a stable status. If your application uses these options, you can still try out the build system without removing them. Warnings will be issued for any unimplemented options but they will otherwise be ignored. However, if your application relies on any of these options to function, you may want to wait to try.</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25102">WASM imports</a> -- WASM can still be loaded manually via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Loading_and_running">standard web APIs</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Building libraries with the new build system via <code>ng-packagr</code> is also not yet possible but library build support will be available in a future release.</p> <h2 id="esm-default-imports-vs-namespace-imports">ESM default imports vs. namespace imports</h2> <p>TypeScript by default allows default exports to be imported as namespace imports and then used in call expressions. This is unfortunately a divergence from the ECMAScript specification. The underlying bundler (<code>esbuild</code>) within the new build system expects ESM code that conforms to the specification. The build system will now generate a warning if your application uses an incorrect type of import of a package. However, to allow TypeScript to accept the correct usage, a TypeScript option must be enabled within the application's <code>tsconfig</code> file. When enabled, the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#esModuleInterop"><code>esModuleInterop</code></a> option provides better alignment with the ECMAScript specification and is also recommended by the TypeScript team. Once enabled, you can update package imports where applicable to an ECMAScript conformant form.</p> <p>Using the <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/moment"><code>moment</code></a> package as an example, the following application code will cause runtime errors:</p> <pre data-language="typescript">import * as moment from 'moment';

console.log(moment().format());</pre> <p>The build will generate a warning to notify you that there is a potential problem. The warning will be similar to:</p> <pre format="shell" data-language="shell">▲ [WARNING] Calling "moment" will crash at run-time because it's an import namespace object, not a function [call-import-namespace]

    src/main.ts:2:12:
      2 │ console.log(moment().format());
        ╵             ~~~~~~

Consider changing "moment" to a default import instead:

    src/main.ts:1:7:
      1 │ import * as moment from 'moment';
        │        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        ╵        moment</pre> <p>However, you can avoid the runtime errors and the warning by enabling the <code>esModuleInterop</code> TypeScript option for the application and changing the import to the following:</p> <pre data-language="typescript">import moment from 'moment';

console.log(moment().format());</pre> <h2 id="vite-as-a-development-server">Vite as a development server</h2> <p>The usage of Vite in the Angular CLI is currently only within a <em>development server capacity only</em>. Even without using the underlying Vite build system, Vite provides a full-featured development server with client side support that has been bundled into a low dependency npm package. This makes it an ideal candidate to provide comprehensive development server functionality. The current development server process uses the new build system to generate a development build of the application in memory and passes the results to Vite to serve the application. The usage of Vite, much like the Webpack-based development server, is encapsulated within the Angular CLI <code>dev-server</code> builder and currently cannot be directly configured.</p> <h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2> <p>There are currently several known issues that you may encounter when trying the new build system. This list will be updated to stay current. If any of these issues are currently blocking you from trying out the new build system, please check back in the future as it may have been solved.</p> <h3 id="type-checking-of-web-worker-code-and-processing-of-nested-web-workers">Type-checking of Web Worker code and processing of nested Web Workers</h3> <p>Web Workers can be used within application code using the same syntax (<code>new Worker(new URL('&lt;workerfile&gt;', import.meta.url))</code>) that is supported with the <code><a href="../api/animations/browser.html" class="code-anchor">browser</a></code> builder. However, the code within the Worker will not currently be type-checked by the TypeScript compiler. TypeScript code is supported just not type-checked. Additionally, any nested workers will not be processed by the build system. A nested worker is a Worker instantiation within another Worker file.</p> <h3 id="order-dependent-side-effectful-imports-in-lazy-modules">Order-dependent side-effectful imports in lazy modules</h3> <p>Import statements that are dependent on a specific ordering and are also used in multiple lazy modules can cause top-level statements to be executed out of order. This is not common as it depends on the usage of side-effectful modules and does not apply to the <code>polyfills</code> option. This is caused by a <a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/399">defect</a> in the underlying bundler but will be addressed in a future update.</p> <blockquote class="alert is-important"> <p>Avoiding the use of modules with non-local side effects (outside of polyfills) is recommended whenever possible regardless of the build system being used and avoids this particular issue. Modules with non-local side effects can have a negative effect on both application size and runtime performance as well.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="bug-reports">Bug reports</h2> <p>Report issues and feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues">GitHub</a>.</p> <p>Please provide a minimal reproduction where possible to aid the team in addressing issues.</p><div class="_attribution">
