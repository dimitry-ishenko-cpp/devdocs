Most applications still need to access a server using the <code><a href="../api/common/http/httpclient.html" class="code-anchor">HttpClient</a></code> to access and save data. For some platforms and applications, you might also want to use the PWA (Progressive Web App) model to improve the user experience.</p> <ul> <li>
