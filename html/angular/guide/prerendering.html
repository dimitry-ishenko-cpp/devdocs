  <h1 id="prerendering-ssg">Prerendering (SSG)</h1> <p>Prerendering, commonly referred to as Static Site Generation (SSG), represents the method by which pages are rendered to static HTML files during the build process.</p> <p>Prerendering maintains the same performance benefits of <a href="ssr/index.html#why-use-ssr">server-side rendering (SSR)</a>. But achieves a reduced Time to First Byte (TTFB), ultimately enhancing user experience. The key distinction lies in its approach that pages are served as static content, and there is no request-based rendering.</p> <p>When the data necessary for server-side rendering remains consistent across all users, the strategy of prerendering emerges as a valuable alternative. Rather than dynamically rendering pages for each user request, prerendering takes a proactive approach by rendering them in advance.</p> <h2 id="how-to-prerender-a-page">How to prerender a page</h2> <p>To prerender a static page, add SSR capabilities to your application with the following Angular CLI command:</p> <pre format="shell" data-language="shell">ng add @angular/ssr</pre> <blockquote class="alert is-helpful"> <p>To create an application with prerendering capabilities from the beginning use the <a href="cli/new.html">ng new --ssr</a> command.</p> </blockquote> <p>Once SSR is added, you can generate the static pages by running the build command:</p> <pre format="shell" data-language="shell">ng build</pre> <h3 id="build-options-for-prerender">Build options for prerender</h3> <p>The application builder <code>prerender</code> option can be either a Boolean or an Object for more fine-tuned configuration. When the option is <code>false</code>, no prerendering is done. When it's is <code>true</code>, all options use the default value. When it's is an Object, each option can be individually configured.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="left">Options</th> <th align="left">Details</th> <th align="left">Default Value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left"><code>discoverRoutes</code></td> <td align="left">Whether the builder should process the Angular Router configuration to find all unparameterized routes and prerender them.</td> <td align="left"><code>true</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left"><code>routesFile</code></td> <td align="left">The path to a file that contains a list of all routes to prerender, separated by newlines.
