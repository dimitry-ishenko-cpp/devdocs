If the component is declared in an NgModule (meaning that it is not standalone) make sure that it is exported correctly from it, by checking its presence in the <code>exports</code> field.</p> <p>When using custom elements or web components, ensure that you add <a href="../api/core/custom_elements_schema.html"><code>CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA</code></a> to the application module.</p> <p>If this does not resolve the error, check the imported libraries for any recent changes to the exports and properties you are using, and restart your server.</p>    </div><div class="_attribution">
