<h1 id="phalcon-developer-tools-on-windows">Phalcon Developer Tools on Windows</h1> <p>These steps will guide you through the process of installing Phalcon Developer Tools for Windows.</p>  <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2> <p>The Phalcon PHP extension is required to run Phalcon Tools. If you haven’t installed it yet, please see the <a class="reference internal" href="install.html"><em>Installation</em></a> section for instructions.</p>   <h2 id="download">Download</h2> <p>You can download a cross platform package containing the developer tools from the <a class="reference external" href="http://phalconphp.com/download">Download</a> section. Also you can clone it from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-devtools">Github</a>.</p> <p>On the Windows platform, you need to configure the system PATH to include Phalcon tools as well as the PHP executable. If you download the Phalcon tools as a zip archive, extract it on any path of your local drive i.e. <em>c:\phalcon-tools</em>. You will need this path in the steps below. Edit the file “phalcon.bat” by right clicking on the file and selecting “Edit”:</p> <div class="figure align-center"> <img alt="../_images/path-0.png" src="https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/_images/path-0.png"> </div> <p>Change the path to the one you installed the Phalcon tools (set PTOOLSPATH=C:phalcon-tools):</p> <div class="figure align-center"> <img alt="../_images/path-01.png" src="https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/_images/path-01.png"> </div> <p>Save the changes.</p>  <h3 id="adding-php-and-tools-to-your-system-path">Adding PHP and Tools to your system PATH</h3> <p>Because the scripts are written in PHP, you need to install it on your machine. Depending on your PHP installation, the executable can be located in various places. Search for the file php.exe and copy the path it is located in. For instance, if using the latest WAMP stack, PHP is located in: <em>C:\wampbin\php\php5.3.10\php.exe</em>.</p> <p>From the Windows start menu, right mouse click on the “Computer” icon and select “Properties”:</p> <div class="figure align-center"> <img alt="../_images/path-1.png" src="https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/_images/path-1.png"> </div> <p>Click the “Advanced” tab and then the button “Environment Variables”:</p> <div class="figure align-center"> <img alt="../_images/path-2.png" src="https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/_images/path-2.png"> </div> <p>At the bottom, look for the section “System variables” and edit the variable “Path”:</p> <div class="figure align-center"> <img alt="../_images/path-3.png" src="https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/_images/path-3.png"> </div> <p>Be very careful on this step! You need to append at the end of the long string the path where your php.exe was located and the path where Phalcon tools are installed. Use the ”;” character to separate the different paths in the variable:</p> <div class="figure align-center"> <img alt="../_images/path-4.png" src="https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/_images/path-4.png"> </div> <p>Accept the changes made by clicking “OK” and close the dialogs opened. From the start menu click on the option “Run”. If you can’t find this option, press “Windows Key” + “R”.</p> <div class="figure align-center"> <img alt="../_images/path-5.png" src="https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/_images/path-5.png"> </div> <p>Type “cmd” and press enter to open the windows command line utility:</p> <div class="figure align-center"> <img alt="../_images/path-6.png" src="https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/_images/path-6.png"> </div> <p>Type the commands “php -v” and “phalcon” and you will see something like this:</p> <div class="figure align-center"> <img alt="../_images/path-7.png" src="https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/_images/path-7.png"> </div> <p>Congratulations you now have Phalcon tools installed!</p>   <h3 id="related-guides">Related Guides</h3> <ul class="simple"> <li><a class="reference internal" href="tools.html"><em>Using Developer Tools</em></a></li> <li><a class="reference internal" href="mactools.html"><em>Installation on OS X</em></a></li> <li><a class="reference internal" href="linuxtools.html"><em>Installation on Linux</em></a></li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
