<h1 id="queueing">Queueing</h1> <p>Activities like processing videos, resizing images or sending emails aren’t suitable to be executed online or in real time because it may slow the loading time of pages and severely impact the user experience.</p> <p>The best solution here is to implement background jobs. The web application puts jobs into a queue and which will be processed separately.</p> <p>While you can find more sophisticated PHP extensions to address queueing in your applications like <a class="reference external" href="http://pecl.php.net/package/amqp">RabbitMQ</a>; Phalcon provides a client for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.igvita.com/2010/05/20/scalable-work-queues-with-beanstalk/">Beanstalk</a>, a job queueing backend inspired by <a class="reference external" href="http://memcached.org/">Memcache</a>. It’s simple, lightweight, and completely specialized for job queueing.</p> <div class="admonition attention"> <p class="first admonition-title">Attention</p> <p class="last">Some of the returns from queue methods require that the module Yaml be installed. Please refer to <a class="reference external" href="http://php.net/manual/book.yaml.php">http://php.net/manual/book.yaml.php</a> for more information. For PHP &lt; 7, Yaml 1.3.0 is acceptable. For PHP &gt;= 7, you will need to use Yaml &gt;= 2.0.0.</p> </div>  <h2 id="putting-jobs-into-the-queue">Putting Jobs into the Queue</h2> <p>After connecting to Beanstalk you can insert as many jobs as required. You can define the message structure according to the needs of the application:</p> <pre class="highlight-php" data-language="php">use Phalcon\Queue\Beanstalk;

// Connect to the queue
$queue = new Beanstalk(
    [
        "host" =&gt; "192.168.0.21",
        "port" =&gt; "11300",
    ]
);

// Insert the job in the queue
$queue-&gt;put(
    [
        "processVideo" =&gt; 4871,
    ]
);
</pre> <p>Available connection options are:</p> <table class="docutils"> <colgroup> <col width="13%"> <col width="73%"> <col width="14%"> </colgroup> <thead valign="bottom"> <tr class="row-odd">
<th class="head">Option</th> <th class="head">Description</th> <th class="head">Default</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody valign="top"> <tr class="row-even">
<td>host</td> <td>IP where the beanstalk server is located</td> <td>127.0.0.1</td> </tr> <tr class="row-odd">
<td>port</td> <td>Connection port</td> <td>11300</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In the above example we stored a message which will allow a background job to process a video. The message is stored in the queue immediately and does not have a certain time to live.</p> <p>Additional options as time to run, priority and delay can be passed as second parameter:</p> <pre class="highlight-php" data-language="php">// Insert the job in the queue with options
$queue-&gt;put(
    [
        "processVideo" =&gt; 4871,
    ],
    [
        "priority" =&gt; 250,
        "delay"    =&gt; 10,
        "ttr"      =&gt; 3600,
    ]
);
</pre> <p>The following options are available:</p> <table class="docutils"> <colgroup> <col width="5%"> <col width="95%"> </colgroup> <thead valign="bottom"> <tr class="row-odd">
<th class="head">Option</th> <th class="head">Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody valign="top"> <tr class="row-even">
<td>priority</td> <td>It’s an integer &lt; 2**32. Jobs with smaller priority values will be scheduled before jobs with larger priorities. The most urgent priority is 0; the least urgent priority is 4,294,967,295.</td> </tr> <tr class="row-odd">
<td>delay</td> <td>It’s an integer number of seconds to wait before putting the job in the ready queue. The job will be in the “delayed” state during this time.</td> </tr> <tr class="row-even">
<td>ttr</td> <td>Time to run – is an integer number of seconds to allow a worker to run this job. This time is counted from the moment a worker reserves this job.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Every job put into the queue returns a “job id” which you can use to track the status of the job:</p> <pre class="highlight-php" data-language="php">$jobId = $queue-&gt;put(
    [
        "processVideo" =&gt; 4871,
    ]
);
</pre>   <h2 id="retrieving-messages">Retrieving Messages</h2> <p>Once a job is placed into the queue, those messages can be consumed by a background worker which will have enough time to complete the task:</p> <pre class="highlight-php" data-language="php">while (($job = $queue-&gt;peekReady()) !== false) {
    $message = $job-&gt;getBody();

    var_dump($message);

    $job-&gt;delete();
}
</pre> <p>Jobs must be removed from the queue to avoid double processing. If multiple background jobs workers are implemented, jobs must be “reserved” so other workers don’t re-process them while other workers have them reserved:</p> <pre class="highlight-php" data-language="php">while (($job = $queue-&gt;reserve()) !== false) {
    $message = $job-&gt;getBody();

    var_dump($message);

    $job-&gt;delete();
}
</pre> <p>Our client implement a basic set of the features provided by Beanstalkd but enough to allow you to build applications implementing queues.</p><div class="_attribution">
