(OHAI-9)</h1></div>  <div class="prose"> <p data-swiftype-index="false"> <a href="https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/main/content/deprecations_ohai_filesystem.md" alt="Link to page on GitHub repository">[edit on GitHub]</a> </p> <p>In Ohai/Chef Client 13 we replaced the existing Filesystem plugin with the Filesystem2 plugin. This was done by having the Filesystem2 plugin populate both <code>node['filesystem2']</code> and <code>node['filesystem']</code>. The Filesystem2 plugin includes a different data format that resolves many of the longstanding bugs in the Filesystem plugin.</p> <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2> <p>If you have a cookbook that relies on data from <code>node['filesystem']</code> you will need to update the code to use data in the new format when migrating to Chef Client 13 or later. On a Chef Client 12 or earlier node you can view the new format by running <span class="title-ref">ohai filesystem2</span> or on a Chef Client 13+ node you can run <code>ohai filesystem</code>.</p> <p>The output of the filesystem plugin is too large to show the difference here, but as an example code that may reference <code>node['/dev/xvda1']['kb_size']</code> would need to be updated to reference <code>node['by_device']['/dev/xvda1']['kb_size']</code> as filesystem data is now displayed by both devices and mounts.</p> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
