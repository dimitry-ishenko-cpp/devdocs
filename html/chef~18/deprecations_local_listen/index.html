Originally we launched it as a normal network service on localhost and then connected to it as per normal. Unfortunately this meant that any user or process on the machine could also connect to the Zero server during the converge and because Chef Zero has no authentication or authorization systems, they could potentially alter data mid-converge. We later added a “socketless” mode, which runs the Zero server completely internally and never exposes it on a real socket.</p> <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2> <p>If you need to re-enable socket mode for now, you can run <span class="title-ref">chef-client –local-mode –listen</span> or set <span class="title-ref">knife[:listen] = true</span> in your <span class="title-ref">.chef/knife.rb</span> or <span class="title-ref">.chef/config.rb</span>.</p> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
