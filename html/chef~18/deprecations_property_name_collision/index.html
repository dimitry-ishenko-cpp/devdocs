This could indicate an error that could lead to unintended behavior.</p> <p>All Ruby objects have a number of methods that are expected to always be available. When a resource property is created, Ruby methods for setting and getting the property value are created for you. If a resource creates a property which is named the same as an existing method, the original method will be overwritten.</p> <p>For example, every Ruby object has a <code>hash</code> method which is expected to return a number. If a resource creates a property named <code>hash</code> and stores a string instead, it could cause errors in your Chef run.</p> <p>A deprecation warning is logged when this occurs. In Chef Client 13, this will raise an exception and your Chef run will fail.</p> <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2> <p>Modify the resource and choose a different name for the property that does not conflict with an already-existing method name.</p> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
