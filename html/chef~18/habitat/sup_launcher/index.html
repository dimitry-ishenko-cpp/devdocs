It is the entry point for running the Supervisor and is the Supervisor for the Supervisor. Whereas the Supervisor is able to automatically update itself, the Launcher is currently released a bit differently, by design; it should be rare that the Launcher ever needs to change.</p> <p>To update your Launchers, run:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="highlight" data-language="ruby"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">hab pkg install core/hab-launcher
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then restart the Supervisor. This will, by necessity, require a restart of supervised services, so factor that into your planning.</p> <p>The Launcher is designed to run as process 1; it is minimal by design. Its responsibilities are simply to be the parent process for the Supervisor.</p> <p>The Launcher enables the Supervisor to update itself without shutting down or re-parenting the services that the Supervisor is supervising. The Launcher is versioned separately from the Supervisor and should be updated very infrequently since an update of the Launcher could require a system restart if it is running as process 1.</p> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
