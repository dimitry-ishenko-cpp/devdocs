This can significantly shorten the cycle time when working on configuration and application lifecycle hooks.</p> <p>Build the plan as you normally would. When you start the Supervisor, pass the name of the directory with your plan inside it:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="highlight" data-language="ruby"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ hab sup run core/redis --config-from /src
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Supervisor will now take its configuration and hooks from /src, rather than from the package you previously built. When the configuration is as you want it, do a final rebuild of the package.</p> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
