If a service is started without explicitly naming the group, it is assigned to the default group for the name of that package. For example:</p> <ul> <li><code>redis.default</code></li> <li>
<code>postgres.financialdb</code> (possibly running in a cluster)</li> <li>
<code>postgres.userdb</code> (possibly running in a cluster)</li> </ul> <h2 id="topology">Topology</h2> <p>Chef Habitat allows you to define the topology of your service groups, which bakes in certain behaviors.</p> <h3 id="standalone">Standalone</h3> <p>This is the default topology, useful for services inside a group that are completely independent from one another. Note that this still means they can share the same configuration.</p> <h3 id="leader--follower">Leader / Follower</h3> <p>This topology allows a distributed application running on at least three Chef Habitat nodes to use a leader/follower configuration. Leaders are elected with Chef Habitatâ€™s leader election algorithm, and followers are restarted to reflect a configuration that follows the new leader. Subsequent elections due to leader failure will update both leader and follower configuration data.</p> <p>You can read more about the internals behind the elections in our <a href="../sup_crypto/index.html#leader-election">advanced developer documentation</a>.</p> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
