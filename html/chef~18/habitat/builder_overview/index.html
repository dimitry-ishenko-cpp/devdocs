Chef Habitat Builder was first launched as a cloud service and as the repository of all available plan templates built by Chef and the supporting community. Due to the fact that the application source code is stored alongside the build package, many users expressed a preference for storing packages and running Chef Habitat Builder on-prem. As a result, Chef Habitat Builder can be consumed either as a cloud based or on-premises solution. Plan files are stored in the Chef Habitat Builder SaaS, where they can be viewed and accessed by the Chef Habitat community and then shared with the on-premises version of the builder where they can then be copied and maintained locally.</p> <h2 id="chef-habitat-builder-enterprise-components-include">Chef Habitat Builder Enterprise Components Include:</h2> <ul> <li>
<strong>Application Manifest</strong> - The Application Manifest provides a single application directory, which includes—at a minimum—the compiled app artifact, dynamic links to all direct and transitive runtime dependencies ,and instructions to install and run the app.</li> <li>
<strong>Deployment Channel Management</strong> - Pre-canned deployment channels that can be used as-is or a user can custom design their own channels. Apps that are deployed through Chef Habitat can subscribe to a channel and be auto-upgraded whenever the app is promoted.</li> <li>

<strong>Content Library</strong> - Hundreds of pre-built <a href="https://bldr.habitat.sh/#/pkgs/core">application delivery packages</a> and core dependencies, which makes it easy to get started with Chef Habitat.</li> <li>
