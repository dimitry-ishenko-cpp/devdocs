This makes it very tricky for tools such as Test Kitchen to reason about the status of a Chef Client run. Starting in Chef Client 12.11, there are now well defined exit codes that the Chef Client can use to communicate the status of the run.</p> <p>This deprecation was added in Chef Client 12.11. In Chef Client 13, only the extended set of exit codes will be supported. For further information on the list of defined error codes, please see <a href="https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/main/rfc062-exit-status.md">RFC 62, which defines them</a>.</p> <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2> <p>If you have built automation that is dependent on the old behavior of Chef Client, we strongly recommend updating it to support the extended set of exit codes.
