After this time period, the response will be revalidated before being served. When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a “Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]” header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header.

The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests. RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times.
