<h1 id="ssh-sharing">  SSH Sharing </h1> <p>Vagrant share makes it trivially easy to allow remote SSH access to your Vagrant environment by supplying the <code>--ssh</code> flag to <code>vagrant share</code>.</p> <p>Easy SSH sharing is incredibly useful if you want to give access to a colleague for troubleshooting ops issues. Additionally, it enables pair programming with a Vagrant environment, if you want!</p> <p>SSH sharing is disabled by default as a security measure. To enable SSH sharing, simply supply the <code>--ssh</code> flag when calling <code>vagrant share</code>.</p> <h2 id="usage">  Usage </h2> <p>Just run <code>vagrant share --ssh</code>!</p> <p>When SSH sharing is enabled, Vagrant generates a brand new keypair for SSH access. The public key portion is automatically inserted into the Vagrant machine, and the private key portion is provided to the user connecting to the Vagrant share. This private key is encrypted using a password that you will be prompted for. This password is <em>never</em> transmitted across the network by Vagrant, and is an extra layer of security preventing anyone who may know your share name from easily accessing your machine.</p> <p>After running <code>vagrant share --ssh</code>, it will output the name of your share:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext">$ vagrant share --ssh
