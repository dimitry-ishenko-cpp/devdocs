<h1 id="vagrant-share">  Vagrant Share </h1> <p>Vagrant Share allows you to share your Vagrant environment with anyone in the world, enabling collaboration directly in your Vagrant environment in almost any network environment with just a single command: <code>vagrant share</code>.</p> <p>Vagrant share has three primary modes or features. These features are not mutually exclusive, meaning that any combination of them can be active at any given time:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><strong>HTTP sharing</strong> will create a URL that you can give to anyone. This URL will route directly into your Vagrant environment. The person using this URL does not need Vagrant installed, so it can be shared with anyone. This is useful for testing webhooks or showing your work to clients, teammates, managers, etc.</p> </li> <li>
<p><strong>SSH sharing</strong> will allow instant SSH access to your Vagrant environment by anyone by running <code>vagrant connect --ssh</code> on the remote side. This is useful for pair programming, debugging ops problems, etc.</p> </li> <li>
<p><strong>General sharing</strong> allows anyone to access any exposed port of your Vagrant environment by running <code>vagrant connect</code> on the remote side. This is useful if the remote side wants to access your Vagrant environment as if it were a computer on the LAN.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The details of each are covered in their specific section in the sidebar to the left. We also have a section where we go into detail about the security implications of this feature.</p> <h2 id="installation">  Installation </h2> <p>Vagrant Share is a Vagrant plugin that must be installed.
