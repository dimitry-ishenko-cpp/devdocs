<h1 id="tips-amp-tricks">  Tips &amp; Tricks </h1> <p>The Vagrantfile is a very flexible configuration format. Since it is just Ruby, there is a lot you can do with it. However, in that same vein, since it is Ruby, there are a lot of ways you can shoot yourself in the foot. When using some of the tips and tricks on this page, please take care to use them correctly.</p> <h2 id="loop-over-vm-definitions">  Loop Over VM Definitions </h2> <p>If you want to apply a slightly different configuration to many multi-machine machines, you can use a loop to do this. For example, if you wanted to create three machines:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby" data-language="ruby">(1..3).each do |i|
  config.vm.define "node-#{i}" do |node|
    node.vm.provision "shell",
      inline: "echo hello from node #{i}"
  end
end
</pre></div>
<blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The inner portion of multi-machine definitions and provider overrides are lazy-loaded. This can cause issues if you change the value of a variable used within the configs. For example, the loop below <em>does not work</em>:</p> </blockquote> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby" data-language="ruby"># THIS DOES NOT WORK!
for i in 1..3 do
  config.vm.define "node-#{i}" do |node|
    node.vm.provision "shell",
      inline: "echo hello from node #{i}"
  end
end
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>for i in  ...</code> construct in Ruby actually modifies the value of <code>i</code> for each iteration, rather than making a copy. Therefore, when you run this, every node will actually provision with the same text.</p> <p>This is an easy mistake to make, and Vagrant cannot really protect against it, so the best we can do is mention it here.</p> <h2 id="overwrite-host-locale-in-ssh-session">  Overwrite host locale in ssh session </h2> <p>Usually, host locale environment variables are passed to guest. It may cause failures if the guest software do not support host locale. One possible solution is override locale in the <code>Vagrantfile</code>:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby" data-language="ruby">ENV["LC_ALL"] = "en_US.UTF-8"

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # ...
end
</pre></div>
<p>The change is only visible within the <code>Vagrantfile</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
