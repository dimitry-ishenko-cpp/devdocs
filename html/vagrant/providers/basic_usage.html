<h1 id="basic-provider-usage">  Basic Provider Usage </h1> <h2 id="boxes">  Boxes </h2> <p>Vagrant boxes are all provider-specific. A box for VirtualBox is incompatible with the VMware Fusion provider, or any other provider. A box must be installed for each provider, and can share the same name as other boxes as long as the providers differ. So you can have both a VirtualBox and VMware Fusion "precise64" box.</p> <p>Installing boxes has not changed at all:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext">$ vagrant box add hashicorp/precise64
</pre></div>
<p>Vagrant now automatically detects what provider a box is for. This is visible when listing boxes. Vagrant puts the provider in parentheses next to the name, as can be seen below.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext">$ vagrant box list
precise64 (virtualbox)
precise64 (vmware_fusion)
</pre></div>
<h2 id="vagrant-up">  Vagrant Up </h2> <p>Once a provider is installed, you can use it by calling <code>vagrant up</code> with the <code>--provider</code> flag. This will force Vagrant to use that specific provider. No other configuration is necessary!</p> <p>In normal day-to-day usage, the <code>--provider</code> flag is not necessary since Vagrant can usually pick the right provider for you. More details on how it does this is below.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext">$ vagrant up --provider=vmware_fusion
</pre></div>
<p>If you specified a <code>--provider</code> flag, you only need to do this for the <code>up</code> command. Once a machine is up and running, Vagrant is able to see what provider is backing a running machine, so commands such as <code>destroy</code>, <code>suspend</code>, etc. do not need to be told what provider to use.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info"> <p>Vagrant currently restricts you to bringing up one provider per machine. If you have a multi-machine environment, you can bring up one machine backed by VirtualBox and another backed by VMware Fusion, for example, but you cannot back the <em>same machine</em> with both VirtualBox and VMware Fusion. This is a limitation that will be removed in a future version of Vagrant.</p> </blockquote>
<h2 id="default-provider">  Default Provider </h2> <p>As mentioned earlier, you typically do not need to specify <code>--provider</code> <em>ever</em>. Vagrant is smart enough about being able to detect the provider you want for a given environment.</p> <p>Vagrant attempts to find the default provider in the following order:</p> <ol> <li>
<p>The <code>--provider</code> flag on a <code>vagrant up</code> is chosen above all else, if it is present.</p> </li> <li>
<p>If the <code>VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER</code> environmental variable is set, it takes next priority and will be the provider chosen.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Vagrant will go through all of the <code>config.vm.provider</code> calls in the Vagrantfile and try each in order. It will choose the first provider that is usable. For example, if you configure Hyper-V, it will never be chosen on Mac this way. It must be both configured and usable.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Vagrant will go through all installed provider plugins (including the ones that come with Vagrant), and find the first plugin that reports it is usable. There is a priority system here: systems that are known better have a higher priority than systems that are worse. For example, if you have the VMware provider installed, it will always take priority over VirtualBox.</p> </li> <li>
<p>If Vagrant still has not found any usable providers, it will error.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Using this method, there are very few cases that Vagrant does not find the correct provider for you. This also allows each <a href="../vagrantfile/index.html">Vagrantfile</a> to define what providers the development environment is made for by ordering provider configurations.</p> <p>A trick is to use <code>config.vm.provider</code> with no configuration at the top of your Vagrantfile to define the order of providers you prefer to support:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby" data-language="ruby">Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # ... other config up here

  # Prefer VMware Fusion before VirtualBox
  config.vm.provider "vmware_fusion"
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox"
end
