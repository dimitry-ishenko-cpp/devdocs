<h1 id="providers">  Providers </h1> <p>While Vagrant ships out of the box with support for <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/hyper-v">Hyper-V</a>, and <a href="https://www.docker.io">Docker</a>, Vagrant has the ability to manage other types of machines as well. This is done by using other <em>providers</em> with Vagrant.</p> <p>Alternate providers can offer different features that make more sense in your use case. For example, if you are using Vagrant for any real work, <a href="https://www.vmware.com">VMware</a> providers are recommended since they're well supported and generally more stable and performant than VirtualBox.</p> <p>Before you can use another provider, you must install it. Installation of other providers is done via the Vagrant plugin system.</p> <p>Once the provider is installed, usage is straightforward and simple, as you would expect with Vagrant.
