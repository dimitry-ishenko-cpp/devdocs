<h1 id="default-provider">  Default Provider </h1> <p>By default, VirtualBox is the default provider for Vagrant. VirtualBox is still the most accessible platform to use Vagrant: it is free, cross-platform, and has been supported by Vagrant for years. With VirtualBox as the default provider, it provides the lowest friction for new users to get started with Vagrant.</p> <p>However, you may find after using Vagrant for some time that you prefer to use another provider as your default. In fact, this is quite common. To make this experience better, Vagrant allows specifying the default provider to use by setting the <code>VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER</code> environmental variable.</p> <p>Just set <code>VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER</code> to the provider you wish to be the default. For example, if you use Vagrant with VMware Fusion, you can set the environmental variable to <code>vmware_fusion</code> and it will be your default.</p><div class="_attribution">
