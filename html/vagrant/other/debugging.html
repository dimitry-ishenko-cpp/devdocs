<h1 id="debugging">  Debugging </h1> <p>As much as we try to keep Vagrant stable and bug free, it is inevitable that issues will arise and Vagrant will behave in unexpected ways.</p> <p>When using these support channels, it is generally helpful to include debugging logs along with any error reports. These logs can often help you troubleshoot any problems you may be having.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"> <p><strong>Scan for sensitive information!</strong> Vagrant debug logs include information about your system including environment variables and user information. If you store sensitive information in the environment or in your user account, please scan or scrub the debug log of this information before uploading the contents to the public Internet.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>Submit debug logs using GitHub Gist.</strong> If you plan on submitting a bug report or issue that includes debug-level logs, please use a service like <a href="https://gist.github.com">Gist</a>. <strong>Do not</strong> paste the raw debug logs into an issue as it makes it very difficult to scroll and parse the information.</p> </blockquote> <p>To enable detailed logging, set the <code>VAGRANT_LOG</code> environmental variable to the desired log level name, which is one of <code>debug</code> (loud), <code>info</code> (normal), <code>warn</code> (quiet), and <code>error</code> (very quiet). When asking for support, please set this to <code>debug</code>. When troubleshooting your own issues, you should start with <code>info</code>, which is much quieter, but contains important information about the behavior of Vagrant.</p> <p>On Linux and Mac systems, this can be done by prepending the <code>vagrant</code> command with an environmental variable declaration:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext">$ VAGRANT_LOG=info vagrant up
</pre></div>
<p>On Windows, multiple steps are required:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext">$ set VAGRANT_LOG=info
$ vagrant up
</pre></div>
<p>You can also get the debug level output using the <code>--debug</code> command line option. For example:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext">$ vagrant up --debug
</pre></div>
<p>On Linux and Mac, if you are saving the output to a file, you may need to redirect stderr and stdout using <code>&amp;&gt;</code>:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext">$ vagrant up --debug &amp;&gt; vagrant.log
</pre></div>
<p>On Windows in PowerShell (outputs to log and screen):</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext">$ vagrant up --debug 2&gt;&amp;1 | Tee-Object -FilePath ".\vagrant.log"
</pre></div><div class="_attribution">
