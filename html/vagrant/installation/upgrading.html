<h1 id="upgrading-vagrant">  Upgrading Vagrant </h1> <p>If you are upgrading from Vagrant 1.0.x, please read the <a href="upgrading-from-1-0.html">specific page dedicated to that</a>. This page covers upgrading Vagrant in general during the 1.x series.</p> <p>Vagrant upgrades during the 1.x release series are straightforward:</p> <ol> <li>
<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Download</a> the new package </li> <li>Install it over the existing package </li> </ol> <p>The installers will properly overwrite and remove old files. It is recommended that no other Vagrant processes are running during the upgrade process.</p> <p>Note that Vagrantfile stability for the new Vagrantfile syntax is not promised until 2.0 final. So while Vagrantfiles made for 1.0.x will <a href="backwards-compatibility.html">continue to work</a>, newer Vagrantfiles may have backwards incompatible changes until 2.0 final.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info alert-block"> <p><strong>Run into troubles upgrading?</strong> Please <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues" class="alert-link">report an issue</a> if you run into problems upgrading. Upgrades are meant to be a smooth process and we consider it a bug if it was not.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
