<h1 id="vagrant-vmware-utility-installation">  Vagrant VMware Utility Installation </h1> <h2 id="system-packages">  System Packages </h2> <p>The Vagrant VMware Utility is provided as a system package. To install the utility, download and install the correct system package from the downloads page.</p> 
<center> <a class="button" href="https://www.vagrantup.com/vmware/downloads.html">Download 1.0.5</a> </center> <h2 id="manual-installation">  Manual Installation </h2> <p>If there is no officially supported system package of the utility available, it may be possible to manually install utility. This applies to Linux platforms only. First, download the latest zip package from the releases page.</p> <p>Next create a directory for the executable and unpack the executable as root.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell" data-language="shell">sudo mkdir /opt/vagrant-vmware-utility/bin
sudo unzip -d /opt/vagrant-vmware-utility/bin vagrant-vmware-utility_1.0.0_x86_64.zip
</pre></div>
<p>After the executable has been installed, the utility setup tasks must be run. First, generate the required certificates:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell" data-language="shell">sudo /opt/vagrant-vmware-utility/bin/vagrant-vmware-utility certificate generate
</pre></div>
<p>The path provided from this command can be used to set the <a href="configuration.html#utility_certificate_path"><code>utility_certificate_path</code></a> in the Vagrantfile configuration if installing to a non-standard path.</p> <p>Finally, install the service. This will also enable the service.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell" data-language="shell">sudo /usr/local/vagrant-vmware-utility/vagrant-vmware-utility service install
</pre></div>
<h1 id="usage">  Usage </h1> <p>The Vagrant VMware Utility provides the Vagrant VMware provider plugin access to various VMware functionalities. The Vagrant VMware Utility is required by the Vagrant VMware Desktop provider plugin.</p> <h2 id="vagrant-vmware-utility-access">  Vagrant VMware Utility Access </h2> <p>The Vagrant VMware Utility provides support for all users on the system using the Vagrant VMware Desktop plugin. If access restrictions to the Utility need to be applied to users on the system, this can be accomplished by restricting user access to the certificates used for connecting to the service.</p> <p>On Windows platforms these certificates can be found at:</p> <ul> <li>C:\ProgramData\HashiCorp\vagrant-vmware-desktop\certificates </li> </ul> <p>On POSIX platforms these certificates can be found at:</p> <ul> <li>/opt/vagrant-vmware-desktop/certificates </li> </ul> <h2 id="vagrant-vmware-utility-service">  Vagrant VMware Utility Service </h2> <p>The Vagrant VMware Utility consists of a small service which runs on the host platform. When the utility installer package is installed, the service is configured to automatically start. If the plugin reports errors communicating with the service, it may have stopped for some reason. The most common cause of the service not being in a running state is the VMware application not being installed. The service can be started again by using the proper command below:</p> <h3 id="windows">  Windows </h3> <p>On Windows platforms a service is created called <code>vagrant-vmware-utility</code>. The service can be manually started using the services GUI (<code>services.msc</code>) or by running the following command from a <code>cmd.exe</code> in administrator mode:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell" data-language="shell">&gt; net.exe start vagrant-vmware-utility
</pre></div>
<h3 id="macos">  macOS </h3> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell" data-language="shell">&gt; sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vagrant.vagrant-vmware-utility.plist
