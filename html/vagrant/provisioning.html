<h1 id="provisioning">  Provisioning </h1> <p>Provisioners in Vagrant allow you to automatically install software, alter configurations, and more on the machine as part of the <code>vagrant up</code> process.</p> <p>This is useful since <a href="boxes.html">boxes</a> typically are not built <em>perfectly</em> for your use case. Of course, if you want to just use <code>vagrant ssh</code> and install the software by hand, that works. But by using the provisioning systems built-in to Vagrant, it automates the process so that it is repeatable. Most importantly, it requires no human interaction, so you can <code>vagrant destroy</code> and <code>vagrant up</code> and have a fully ready-to-go work environment with a single command. Powerful.</p> <p>Vagrant gives you multiple options for provisioning the machine, from simple shell scripts to more complex, industry-standard configuration management systems.</p> <p>If you've never used a configuration management system before, it is recommended you start with basic <a href="provisioning/shell.html">shell scripts</a> for provisioning.</p> <p>You can find the full list of built-in provisioners and usage of these provisioners in the navigational area to the left.</p> <h2 id="when-provisioning-happens">  When Provisioning Happens </h2> <p>Provisioning happens at certain points during the lifetime of your Vagrant environment:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>On the first <code>vagrant up</code> that creates the environment, provisioning is run. If the environment was already created and the up is just resuming a machine or booting it up, they will not run unless the <code>--provision</code> flag is explicitly provided.</p> </li> <li>
<p>When <code>vagrant provision</code> is used on a running environment.</p> </li> <li>
<p>When <code>vagrant reload --provision</code> is called. The <code>--provision</code> flag must be present to force provisioning.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can also bring up your environment and explicitly <em>not</em> run provisioners by specifying <code>--no-provision</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
