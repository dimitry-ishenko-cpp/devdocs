<h1 id="command-line-interface">  Command-Line Interface </h1> <p>Almost all interaction with Vagrant is done through the command-line interface.</p> <p>The interface is available using the <code>vagrant</code> command, and comes installed with Vagrant automatically. The <code>vagrant</code> command in turn has many subcommands, such as <code>vagrant up</code>, <code>vagrant destroy</code>, etc.</p> <p>If you run <code>vagrant</code> by itself, help will be displayed showing all available subcommands. In addition to this, you can run any Vagrant command with the <code>-h</code> flag to output help about that specific command. For example, try running <code>vagrant init -h</code>. The help will output a one sentence synopsis of what the command does as well as a list of all the flags the command accepts.</p> <p>In depth documentation and use cases of various Vagrant commands is available by reading the appropriate sub-section available in the left navigational area of this site.</p> <p>You may also wish to consult the <a href="../other/environmental-variables.html">documentation</a> regarding the environmental variables that can be used to configure and control Vagrant in a global way.</p><div class="_attribution">
