<p>On multi-machine setups, you can login to each vm using the name as displayed on <code>vagrant status</code></p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell" data-language="shell"> $ vagrant status
Current machine states:

node1                     running (virtualbox)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state.

The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
up-to-date (use "vagrant global-status --prune" to prune invalid
entries). To interact with any of the machines, you can go to that
directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly with
Vagrant commands from any directory.

<p>If a <code>--</code> (two hyphens) are found on the command line, any arguments after this are passed directly into the <code>ssh</code> executable. This allows you to pass any arbitrary commands to do things such as reverse tunneling down into the <code>ssh</code> program.</p> <h2 id="options">  Options </h2> <ul> <li>
<p><a href="#c-command"><code>-c COMMAND</code></a> or <code>--command COMMAND</code> - This executes a single SSH command, prints out the stdout and stderr, and exits.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#p"><code>-p</code></a> or <code>--plain</code> - This does an SSH without authentication, leaving authentication up to the user.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="ssh-client-usage">  SSH client usage </h2> <p>Vagrant will attempt to use the local SSH client installed on the host machine. On POSIX machines, an SSH client must be installed and available on the PATH.</p> <p>For Windows installations, an SSH client is provided within the installer image. If no SSH client is found on the current PATH, Vagrant will use the SSH client it provided. Depending on the local environment used for running Vagrant, the installer provided SSH client may not work correctly. For example, when using a cygwin or msys2 shell the SSH client will fail to work as expected when run interactively. Installing the SSH package built for the current working environment will resolve this issue.</p> <h2 id="background-execution">  Background Execution </h2> <p>If the command you specify runs in the background (such as appending a <code>&amp;</code> to a shell command), it will be terminated almost immediately. This is because when Vagrant executes the command, it executes it within the context of a shell, and when the shell exits, all of the child processes also exit.</p> <p>To avoid this, you will need to detach the process from the shell. Please Google to learn how to do this for your shell. One method of doing this is the <code>nohup</code> command.</p> <h2 id="pageant-on-windows">  Pageant on Windows </h2> <p>The SSH executable will not be able to access Pageant on Windows. While Vagrant is capable of accessing Pageant via internal libraries, the SSH executable does not have support for Pageant. This means keys from Pageant will not be available for forwarding when using the <code>vagrant ssh</code> command.</p> <p>Third party programs exist to allow the SSH executable to access Pageant by creating a unix socket for the SSH executable to read. For more information please see <a href="https://github.com/cuviper/ssh-pageant">ssh-pageant</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
