<h1 id="hyper-v">  Hyper-V </h1> <p>Vagrant comes with support out of the box for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V">Hyper-V</a>, a native hypervisor written by Microsoft. Hyper-V is available by default for almost all Windows 8.1 and later installs.</p> <p>The Hyper-V provider is compatible with Windows 8.1 and later only. Prior versions of Hyper-V do not include the necessary APIs for Vagrant to work.</p> <p>Hyper-V must be enabled prior to using the provider. Most Windows installations will not have Hyper-V enabled by default. Hyper-V is available by default for almost all Windows Enterprise, Professional, or Education 8.1 and later installs. To enable Hyper-V, go to "Programs and Features", click on "Turn Windows features on or off" and check the box next to "Hyper-V". Or install via PowerShell with:</p> <p><code>Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All</code></p> <p>See official documentation <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v">here</a>.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning"> <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Enabling Hyper-V will cause VirtualBox, VMware, and any other virtualization technology to no longer work. See <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SwitchEasilyBetweenVirtualBoxAndHyperVWithABCDEditBootEntryInWindows81.aspx">this blog post</a> for an easy way to create a boot entry to boot Windows without Hyper-V enabled, if there will be times you will need other hypervisors.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
