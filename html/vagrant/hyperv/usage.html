<h1 id="usage">  Usage </h1> <p>The Vagrant Hyper-V provider is used just like any other provider. Please read the general <a href="../providers/basic_usage.html">basic usage</a> page for providers.</p> <p>The value to use for the <code>--provider</code> flag is <code>hyperv</code>.</p> <p>Hyper-V also requires that you execute Vagrant with administrative privileges. Creating and managing virtual machines with Hyper-V requires admin rights. Vagrant will show you an error if it does not have the proper permissions.</p> <p>Boxes for Hyper-V can be easily found on <a href="https://vagrantcloud.com/boxes/search">HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud</a>. To get started, you might want to try the <code>hashicorp/precise64</code> box.</p><div class="_attribution">
