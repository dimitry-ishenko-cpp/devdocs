<h1 id="limitations">  Limitations </h1> <p>The Vagrant Hyper-V provider works in almost every way like the VirtualBox or VMware provider would, but has some limitations that are inherent to Hyper-V itself.</p> <h2 id="limited-networking">  Limited Networking </h2> <p>Vagrant does not yet know how to create and configure new networks for Hyper-V. When launching a machine with Hyper-V, Vagrant will prompt you asking what virtual switch you want to connect the virtual machine to.</p> <p>A result of this is that networking configurations in the Vagrantfile are completely ignored with Hyper-V. Vagrant cannot enforce a static IP or automatically configure a NAT.</p> <p>However, the IP address of the machine will be reported as part of the <code>vagrant up</code>, and you can use that IP address as if it were a host only network.</p> <h2 id="snapshots">  Snapshots </h2> <p>Restoring snapshot VMs using <code>vagrant snapshot pop</code> or <code>vagrant snapshot restore</code> will sometimes raise errors when mounting SMB shared folders, however these mounts will still work inside the guest.</p><div class="_attribution">
