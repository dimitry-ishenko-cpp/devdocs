<h1 id="vmware">  VMware </h1> <p><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com">HashiCorp</a> develops an official <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html">VMware Fusion</a> and <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/">VMware Workstation</a> <a href="providers/index.html">provider</a> for Vagrant. This provider allows Vagrant to power VMware based machines and take advantage of the improved stability and performance that VMware software offers.</p> <p>Learn more about the VMware providers on the <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/vmware">VMware provider</a> page on the Vagrant website.</p> <p>This provider is a drop-in replacement for VirtualBox, meaning that every VirtualBox feature that Vagrant supports is fully functional in VMware as well. However, there are some VMware-specific things such as box formats, configurations, etc. that are documented here.</p> <p>For the most up-to-date information on compatibility and supported versions of VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation, please visit the <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/vmware">Vagrant VMware product page</a>. Please note that VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation are third-party products that must be purchased and installed separately prior to using the provider.</p> <p>Use the navigation to the left to find a specific VMware topic to read more about.</p><div class="_attribution">
