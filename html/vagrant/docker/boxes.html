<h1 id="docker-boxes">  Docker Boxes </h1> <p>The Docker provider does not require a Vagrant box. The <code>config.vm.box</code> setting is completely optional.</p> <p>A box can still be used and specified, however, to provide defaults. Because the <code>Vagrantfile</code> within a box is loaded as part of the configuration loading sequence, it can be used to configure the foundation of a development environment.</p> <p>In general, however, you will not need a box with the Docker provider.</p><div class="_attribution">
