<h1 id="docker">  Docker </h1> <p>Vagrant comes with support out of the box for using Docker as a provider. This allows for your development environments to be backed by Docker containers rather than virtual machines. Additionally, it provides for a good workflow for developing Dockerfiles.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning"> <p><strong>Warning: Docker knowledge assumed.</strong> We assume that you know what Docker is and that you are comfortable with the basics of Docker. If not, we recommend starting with another provider such as <a href="../virtualbox/index.html">VirtualBox</a>.</p> </blockquote>
