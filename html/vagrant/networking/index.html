<h1 id="networking">  Networking </h1> <p>In order to access the Vagrant environment created, Vagrant exposes some high-level networking options for things such as forwarded ports, connecting to a public network, or creating a private network.</p> <p>The high-level networking options are meant to define an abstraction that works across multiple <a href="../providers/index.html">providers</a>. This means that you can take your Vagrantfile you used to spin up a VirtualBox machine and you can reasonably expect that Vagrantfile to behave the same with something like VMware.</p> <p>You should first read the <a href="basic_usage.html">basic usage</a> page and then continue by reading the documentation for a specific networking primitive by following the navigation to the left.</p> <h2 id="advanced-configuration">  Advanced Configuration </h2> <p>In some cases, these options are <em>too</em> high-level, and you may want to more finely tune and configure the network interfaces of the underlying machine. Most providers expose <a href="../providers/configuration.html">provider-specific configuration</a> to do this, so please read the documentation for your specific provider to see what options are available.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info"> <p><strong>For beginners:</strong> It is strongly recommended you use only the high-level networking options until you are comfortable with the Vagrant workflow and have things working at a basic level. Provider-specific network configuration can very quickly lock you out of your guest machine if improperly done.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
