Similarly, if you're using <a href="../../dart-core/object/nosuchmethod.html">noSuchMethod</a> to interact with another language (JavaScript, for example) extract all the identifiers from the API you use and include them in this list.</p> <p>Note that specifying a symbol only ensures that the symbol will be available under that name at runtime. It does not mark targets with that name as available for reflection. See <a href="targets.html">targets</a> and <a href="metatargets.html">metaTargets</a> for that purpose.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">final symbols;</pre><div class="_attribution">
