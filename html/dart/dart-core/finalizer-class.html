  // Keeps the finalizer itself reachable, otherwise it might be disposed
  // before the finalizer callback gets a chance to run.
  static final Finalizer&lt;DBConnection&gt; _finalizer =
      Finalizer((connection) =&gt; connection.close());

  final DBConnection _connection;

  Database._fromConnection(this._connection);

  factory Database.connect() {
    // Wraps the connection in a nice user API,
    // *and* closes connection if the user forgets to.
    final connection = DBConnection.connect();
    final wrapper = Database._fromConnection(connection);
    // Get finalizer callback when `wrapper` is no longer reachable.
    _finalizer.attach(wrapper, connection, detach: wrapper);
    return wrapper;
  }

  void close() {
    // User requested close.
    _connection.close();
    // Detach from finalizer, no longer needed.
    _finalizer.detach(this);
  }

  // Some useful methods.
}</pre> <p>This example has an example of an external resource that needs clean-up. The finalizer is used to clean up an external connection when the user of the API no longer has access to that connection. The example uses the same object as attached object and detach key, which is a useful approach when each attached object can be detached individually. Being a detachment key doesn't keep an object alive.</p> <p>No promises are made that the callback will ever be called. The only thing that is guaranteed is that if a finalizer's callback is called with a specific finalization token as argument, then at least one value with an attachment to the finalizer that has that finalization token, is no longer accessible to the program.</p> <p>If the finalizer <em>itself</em> becomes unreachable, it's allowed to be garbage collected and then it won't trigger any further callbacks. Always make sure to keep the finalizer itself reachable while it's needed.</p> <p>If multiple finalizers are attached to a single object, or the same finalizer is attached multiple times to an object, and that object becomes inaccessible to the program, then any number (including zero) of those attachments may trigger their associated finalizer's callback. It will not necessarily be all or none of them.</p> <p>Finalization callbacks will happen as <em>events</em>. They will not happen during execution of other code, and not as a microtask, but as high-level events similar to timer events.</p> <p>Finalization callbacks must not throw.</p> <p>When running on the Dart native runtime, and the callback is a native function rather than a Dart function, use <code>dart:ffi</code>'s <a href="../dart-ffi/nativefinalizer-class.html">NativeFinalizer</a> instead.</p>   <dl class="dl-horizontal"> <dt>Annotations</dt> <dd> <ul class="annotation-list clazz-relationships"> <li>@Since("2.17")</li> </ul> </dd> </dl>   <h2 id="constructors">Constructors</h2> <dl class="constructor-summary-list"> <dt id="Finalizer"> <a href="finalizer/finalizer.html">Finalizer</a>(void callback(T)) <div class="constructor-modifier features">factory</div>
