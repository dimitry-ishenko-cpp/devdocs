If any operation tries to read an element that is not an instance of <code>R</code>, the access will throw instead.</p> <p>Elements added to the list (e.g., by using <a href="add.html">add</a> or <a href="addall.html">addAll</a>) must be instances of <code>R</code> to be valid arguments to the adding function, and they must also be instances of <code>E</code> to be accepted by this list as well.</p> <p>Methods which accept <code>Object?</code> as argument, like <a href="../iterable/contains.html">contains</a> and <a href="remove.html">remove</a>, will pass the argument directly to the this list's method without any checks. That means that you can do <code>listOfStrings.cast&lt;int&gt;().remove("a")</code> successfully, even if it looks like it shouldn't have any effect.</p> <p>Typically implemented as <code>List.castFrom&lt;E, R&gt;(this)</code>.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">List&lt;R&gt; cast&lt;R&gt;();</pre><div class="_attribution">
