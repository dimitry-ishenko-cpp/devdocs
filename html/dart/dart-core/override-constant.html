This annotation is recognized by the Dart analyzer, and it allows the analyzer to provide hints or warnings for some potential problems of an otherwise valid program. As such, the meaning of this annotation is defined by the Dart analyzer.</p> <p>The <code>@override</code> annotation expresses the intent that a declaration <em>should</em> override an interface method, something which is not visible from the declaration itself. This extra information allows the analyzer to provide a warning when that intent is not satisfied, where a member is intended to override a superclass member or implement an interface member, but fails to do so. Such a situation can arise if a member name is mistyped, or if the superclass renames the member.</p> <p>The <code>@override</code> annotation applies to instance methods, instance getters, instance setters and instance variables (fields). When applied to an instance variable, it means that the variable's implicit getter and setter (if any) are marked as overriding. It has no effect on the variable itself.</p> <p>Further <a href="https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/">lints</a> can be used to enable more warnings based on <code>@override</code> annotations.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">const Object override = _Override();</pre><div class="_attribution">
