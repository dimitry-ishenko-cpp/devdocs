The extension stream has a listener while at least one such client has registered as a listener, and has not yet disconnected again.</p> <p>Calling <a href="postevent.html">postEvent</a> while the stream has listeners will attempt to deliver that event to all current listeners, although a listener can disconnect before the event is delivered. Calling <a href="postevent.html">postEvent</a> when the stream has no listener means that no-one will receive the event, and the call is effectively a no-op.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">@pragma("vm:recognized", "other")
