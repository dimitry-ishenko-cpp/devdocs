In most situations providing the un-compressed body is most convenient. Therefore the default behavior is to un-compress the body. However in some situations (e.g. implementing a transparent proxy) keeping the uncompressed stream is required.</p> <p>NOTE: Headers in the response are never modified. This means that when automatic un-compression is turned on the value of the header <code>Content-Length</code> will reflect the length of the original compressed body. Likewise the header <code>Content-Encoding</code> will also have the original value indicating compression.</p> <p>NOTE: Automatic un-compression is only performed if the <code>Content-Encoding</code> header value is <code>gzip</code>.</p> <p>This value affects all responses produced by this client after the value is changed.</p> <p>To disable, set to <code>false</code>.</p> <p>Default is <code>true</code>.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">bool autoUncompress = true;</pre><div class="_attribution">
