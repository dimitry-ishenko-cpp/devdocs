Each <a href="../streamtransformer-class.html">StreamTransformer</a> should document clearly how it transforms the stream (on the class or variable used to access the transformer), as well as any differences from the following typical behavior:</p> <ul> <li>When the returned stream is listened to, it starts listening to the input <code>stream</code>.</li> <li>Subscriptions of the returned stream forward (in a reasonable time) a <a href="../streamsubscription/pause.html">StreamSubscription.pause</a> call to the subscription of the input <code>stream</code>.</li> <li>Similarly, canceling a subscription of the returned stream eventually (in reasonable time) cancels the subscription of the input <code>stream</code>.</li> </ul> <p>"Reasonable time" depends on the transformer and stream. Some transformers, like a "timeout" transformer, might make these operations depend on a duration. Others might not delay them at all, or just by a microtask.</p> <p>Transformers are free to handle errors in any way. A transformer implementation may choose to propagate errors, or convert them to other events, or ignore them completely, but if errors are ignored, it should be documented explicitly.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">Stream&lt;T&gt; bind(Stream&lt;S&gt; stream);</pre><div class="_attribution">
