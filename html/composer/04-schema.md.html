<h1 id="the-composer-json-schema">The composer.json schema</h1> <p>This chapter will explain all of the fields available in <code>composer.json</code>.</p> <h2 id="json-schema">JSON schema</h2> <p>We have a <a href="https://json-schema.org">JSON schema</a> that documents the format and can also be used to validate your <code>composer.json</code>. In fact, it is used by the <code>validate</code> command. You can find it at: <a href="https://getcomposer.org/schema.json">https://getcomposer.org/schema.json</a></p> <h2 id="root-package">Root Package</h2> <p>The root package is the package defined by the <code>composer.json</code> at the root of your project. It is the main <code>composer.json</code> that defines your project requirements.</p> <p>Certain fields only apply when in the root package context. One example of this is the <code>config</code> field. Only the root package can define configuration. The config of dependencies is ignored. This makes the <code>config</code> field <code>root-only</code>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> A package can be the root package or not, depending on the context. For example, if your project depends on the <code>monolog</code> library, your project is the root package. However, if you clone <code>monolog</code> from GitHub in order to fix a bug in it, then <code>monolog</code> is the root package.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="properties">Properties</h2> <h3 id="name">name</h3> <p>The name of the package. It consists of vendor name and project name, separated by <code>/</code>. Examples:</p> <ul> <li>monolog/monolog</li> <li>igorw/event-source</li> </ul> <p>The name must be lowercase and consist of words separated by <code>-</code>, <code>.</code> or <code>_</code>. The complete name should match <code>^[a-z0-9]([_.-]?[a-z0-9]+)*/[a-z0-9](([_.]?|-{0,2})[a-z0-9]+)*$</code>.</p> <p>The <code>name</code> property is required for published packages (libraries).</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Before Composer version 2.0, a name could contain any character, including white spaces.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="description">description</h3> <p>A short description of the package. Usually this is one line long.</p> <p>Required for published packages (libraries).</p> <h3 id="version">version</h3> <p>The version of the package. In most cases this is not required and should be omitted (see below).</p> <p>This must follow the format of <code>X.Y.Z</code> or <code>vX.Y.Z</code> with an optional suffix of <code>-dev</code>, <code>-patch</code> (<code>-p</code>), <code>-alpha</code> (<code>-a</code>), <code>-beta</code> (<code>-b</code>) or <code>-RC</code>. The patch, alpha, beta and RC suffixes can also be followed by a number.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>1.0.0</li> <li>1.0.2</li> <li>1.1.0</li> <li>0.2.5</li> <li>1.0.0-dev</li> <li>1.0.0-alpha3</li> <li>1.0.0-beta2</li> <li>1.0.0-RC5</li> <li>v2.0.4-p1</li> </ul> <p>Optional if the package repository can infer the version from somewhere, such as the VCS tag name in the VCS repository. In that case it is also recommended to omit it.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Packagist uses VCS repositories, so the statement above is very much true for Packagist as well. Specifying the version yourself will most likely end up creating problems at some point due to human error.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="type">type</h3> <p>The type of the package. It defaults to <code>library</code>.</p> <p>Package types are used for custom installation logic. If you have a package that needs some special logic, you can define a custom type. This could be a <code>symfony-bundle</code>, a <code>wordpress-plugin</code> or a <code>typo3-cms-extension</code>. These types will all be specific to certain projects, and they will need to provide an installer capable of installing packages of that type.</p> <p>Out of the box, Composer supports four types:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>library:</strong> This is the default. It will copy the files to <code>vendor</code>.</li> <li>
<strong>project:</strong> This denotes a project rather than a library. For example application shells like the <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard">Symfony standard edition</a>, CMSs like the <a href="https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-installer">SilverStripe installer</a> or full fledged applications distributed as packages. This can for example be used by IDEs to provide listings of projects to initialize when creating a new workspace.</li> <li>
<strong>metapackage:</strong> An empty package that contains requirements and will trigger their installation, but contains no files and will not write anything to the filesystem. As such, it does not require a dist or source key to be installable.</li> <li>
<strong>composer-plugin:</strong> A package of type <code>composer-plugin</code> may provide an installer for other packages that have a custom type. Read more in the <a href="articles/custom-installers.md.html">dedicated article</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Only use a custom type if you need custom logic during installation. It is recommended to omit this field and have it default to <code>library</code>.</p> <h3 id="keywords">keywords</h3> <p>An array of keywords that the package is related to. These can be used for searching and filtering.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>logging</li> <li>events</li> <li>database</li> <li>redis</li> <li>templating</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Some special keywords trigger <code>composer require</code> without the <code>--dev</code> option to prompt users if they would like to add these packages to <code>require-dev</code> instead of <code>require</code>. These are: <code>dev</code>, <code>testing</code>, <code>static analysis</code>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Optional.</p> <h3 id="homepage">homepage</h3> <p>A URL to the website of the project.</p> <p>Optional.</p> <h3 id="readme">readme</h3> <p>A relative path to the readme document.</p> <p>Optional.</p> <h3 id="time">time</h3> <p>Release date of the version.</p> <p>Must be in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> or <code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</code> format.</p> <p>Optional.</p> <h3 id="license">license</h3> <p>The license of the package. This can be either a string or an array of strings.</p> <p>The recommended notation for the most common licenses is (alphabetical):</p> <ul> <li>Apache-2.0</li> <li>BSD-2-Clause</li> <li>BSD-3-Clause</li> <li>BSD-4-Clause</li> <li>GPL-2.0-only / GPL-2.0-or-later</li> <li>GPL-3.0-only / GPL-3.0-or-later</li> <li>LGPL-2.1-only / LGPL-2.1-or-later</li> <li>LGPL-3.0-only / LGPL-3.0-or-later</li> <li>MIT</li> </ul> <p>Optional, but it is highly recommended to supply this. More identifiers are listed at the <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/">SPDX Open Source License Registry</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> For closed-source software, you may use <code>"proprietary"</code> as the license identifier.</p> </blockquote> <p>An Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "license": "MIT"
}</pre> <p>For a package, when there is a choice between licenses ("disjunctive license"), multiple can be specified as an array.</p> <p>An Example for disjunctive licenses:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "license": [
        "LGPL-2.1-only",
        "GPL-3.0-or-later"
    ]
}</pre> <p>Alternatively they can be separated with "or" and enclosed in parentheses;</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "license": "(LGPL-2.1-only or GPL-3.0-or-later)"
}</pre> <p>Similarly, when multiple licenses need to be applied ("conjunctive license"), they should be separated with "and" and enclosed in parentheses.</p> <h3 id="authors">authors</h3> <p>The authors of the package. This is an array of objects.</p> <p>Each author object can have following properties:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>name:</strong> The author's name. Usually their real name.</li> <li>
<strong>email:</strong> The author's email address.</li> <li>
<strong>homepage:</strong> URL to the author's website.</li> <li>

        }
    ]
}</pre> <p>Optional.</p> <h3 id="package-links">Package links</h3> <p>All of the following take an object which maps package names to versions of the package via version constraints. Read more about versions <a href="articles/versions.md.html">here</a>.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "1.0.*"
    }
}</pre> <p>All links are optional fields.</p> <p><code>require</code> and <code>require-dev</code> additionally support <em>stability flags</em> (<a href="04-schema.md.html#root-package">root-only</a>). They take the form "<em>constraint</em>@<em>stability flag</em>". These allow you to further restrict or expand the stability of a package beyond the scope of the <a href="#minimum-stability">minimum-stability</a> setting. You can apply them to a constraint, or apply them to an empty <em>constraint</em> if you want to allow unstable packages of a dependency for example.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "1.0.*@beta",
        "acme/foo": "@dev"
    }
}</pre> <p>If one of your dependencies has a dependency on an unstable package you need to explicitly require it as well, along with its sufficient stability flag.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>Assuming <code>doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle</code> requires <code>"doctrine/data-fixtures": "dev-master"</code> then inside the root composer.json you need to add the second line below to allow dev releases for the <code>doctrine/data-fixtures</code> package :</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle": "dev-master",
        "doctrine/data-fixtures": "@dev"
    }
}</pre> <p><code>require</code> and <code>require-dev</code> additionally support explicit references (i.e. commit) for dev versions to make sure they are locked to a given state, even when you run update. These only work if you explicitly require a dev version and append the reference with <code>#&lt;ref&gt;</code>. This is also a <a href="04-schema.md.html#root-package">root-only</a> feature and will be ignored in dependencies.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "dev-master#2eb0c0978d290a1c45346a1955188929cb4e5db7",
        "acme/foo": "1.0.x-dev#abc123"
    }
}</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature has severe technical limitations, as the composer.json metadata will still be read from the branch name you specify before the hash. You should therefore only use this as a temporary solution during development to remediate transient issues, until you can switch to tagged releases. The Composer team does not actively support this feature and will not accept bug reports related to it.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is also possible to inline-alias a package constraint so that it matches a constraint that it otherwise would not. For more information <a href="articles/aliases.md.html">see the aliases article</a>.</p> <p><code>require</code> and <code>require-dev</code> also support references to specific PHP versions and PHP extensions your project needs to run successfully.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "require": {
        "php": "&gt;=7.4",
        "ext-mbstring": "*"
    }
}</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to list PHP extensions your project requires. Not all PHP installations are created equal: some may miss extensions you may consider as standard (such as <code>ext-mysqli</code> which is not installed by default in Fedora/CentOS minimal installation systems). Failure to list required PHP extensions may lead to a bad user experience: Composer will install your package without any errors but it will then fail at run-time. The <code>composer show --platform</code> command lists all PHP extensions available on your system. You may use it to help you compile the list of extensions you use and require. Alternatively you may use third party tools to analyze your project for the list of extensions used.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="require">require</h4> <p>Map of packages required by this package. The package will not be installed unless those requirements can be met.</p> <h4 id="require-dev">require-dev <span>(<a href="04-schema.md.html#root-package">root-only</a>)</span>
</h4> <p>Map of packages required for developing this package, or running tests, etc. The dev requirements of the root package are installed by default. Both <code>install</code> or <code>update</code> support the <code>--no-dev</code> option that prevents dev dependencies from being installed.</p> <h4 id="conflict">conflict</h4> <p>Map of packages that conflict with this version of this package. They will not be allowed to be installed together with your package.</p> <p>Note that when specifying ranges like <code>&lt;1.0 &gt;=1.1</code> in a <code>conflict</code> link, this will state a conflict with all versions that are less than 1.0 <em>and</em> equal or newer than 1.1 at the same time, which is probably not what you want. You probably want to go for <code>&lt;1.0 || &gt;=1.1</code> in this case.</p> <h4 id="replace">replace</h4> <p>Map of packages that are replaced by this package. This allows you to fork a package, publish it under a different name with its own version numbers, while packages requiring the original package continue to work with your fork because it replaces the original package.</p> <p>This is also useful for packages that contain sub-packages, for example the main symfony/symfony package contains all the Symfony Components which are also available as individual packages. If you require the main package it will automatically fulfill any requirement of one of the individual components, since it replaces them.</p> <p>Caution is advised when using replace for the sub-package purpose explained above. You should then typically only replace using <code>self.version</code> as a version constraint, to make sure the main package only replaces the sub-packages of that exact version, and not any other version, which would be incorrect.</p> <h4 id="provide">provide</h4> <p>Map of packages that are provided by this package. This is mostly useful for implementations of common interfaces. A package could depend on some virtual package e.g. <code>psr/logger-implementation</code>, any library that implements this logger interface would list it in <code>provide</code>. Implementors can then be <a href="https://packagist.org/providers/psr/log-implementation">found on Packagist.org</a>.</p> <p>Using <code>provide</code> with the name of an actual package rather than a virtual one implies that the code of that package is also shipped, in which case <code>replace</code> is generally a better choice. A common convention for packages providing an interface and relying on other packages to provide an implementation (for instance the PSR interfaces) is to use a <code>-implementation</code> suffix for the name of the virtual package corresponding to the interface package.</p> <h4 id="suggest">suggest</h4> <p>Suggested packages that can enhance or work well with this package. These are informational and are displayed after the package is installed, to give your users a hint that they could add more packages, even though they are not strictly required.</p> <p>The format is like package links above, except that the values are free text and not version constraints.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "suggest": {
        "monolog/monolog": "Allows more advanced logging of the application flow",
        "ext-xml": "Needed to support XML format in class Foo"
    }
}</pre> <h3 id="autoload">autoload</h3> <p>Autoload mapping for a PHP autoloader.</p> <p><a href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/"><code>PSR-4</code></a> and <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/"><code>PSR-0</code></a> autoloading, <code>classmap</code> generation and <code>files</code> includes are supported.</p> <p>PSR-4 is the recommended way since it offers greater ease of use (no need to regenerate the autoloader when you add classes).</p> <h4 id="psr-4">PSR-4</h4> <p>Under the <code>psr-4</code> key you define a mapping from namespaces to paths, relative to the package root. When autoloading a class like <code>Foo\\Bar\\Baz</code> a namespace prefix <code>Foo\\</code> pointing to a directory <code>src/</code> means that the autoloader will look for a file named <code>src/Bar/Baz.php</code> and include it if present. Note that as opposed to the older PSR-0 style, the prefix (<code>Foo\\</code>) is <strong>not</strong> present in the file path.</p> <p>Namespace prefixes must end in <code>\\</code> to avoid conflicts between similar prefixes. For example <code>Foo</code> would match classes in the <code>FooBar</code> namespace so the trailing backslashes solve the problem: <code>Foo\\</code> and <code>FooBar\\</code> are distinct.</p> <p>The PSR-4 references are all combined, during install/update, into a single key =&gt; value array which may be found in the generated file <code>vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php</code>.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Monolog\\": "src/",
            "Vendor\\Namespace\\": ""
        }
    }
}</pre> <p>If you need to search for a same prefix in multiple directories, you can specify them as an array as such:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": { "Monolog\\": ["src/", "lib/"] }
    }
}</pre> <p>If you want to have a fallback directory where any namespace will be looked for, you can use an empty prefix like:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": { "": "src/" }
    }
}</pre> <h4 id="psr-0">PSR-0</h4> <p>Under the <code>psr-0</code> key you define a mapping from namespaces to paths, relative to the package root. Note that this also supports the PEAR-style non-namespaced convention.</p> <p>Please note namespace declarations should end in <code>\\</code> to make sure the autoloader responds exactly. For example <code>Foo</code> would match in <code>FooBar</code> so the trailing backslashes solve the problem: <code>Foo\\</code> and <code>FooBar\\</code> are distinct.</p> <p>The PSR-0 references are all combined, during install/update, into a single key =&gt; value array which may be found in the generated file <code>vendor/composer/autoload_namespaces.php</code>.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": {
            "Monolog\\": "src/",
            "Vendor\\Namespace\\": "src/",
            "Vendor_Namespace_": "src/"
        }
    }
}</pre> <p>If you need to search for a same prefix in multiple directories, you can specify them as an array as such:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": { "Monolog\\": ["src/", "lib/"] }
    }
}</pre> <p>The PSR-0 style is not limited to namespace declarations only but may be specified right down to the class level. This can be useful for libraries with only one class in the global namespace. If the php source file is also located in the root of the package, for example, it may be declared like this:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": { "UniqueGlobalClass": "" }
    }
}</pre> <p>If you want to have a fallback directory where any namespace can be, you can use an empty prefix like:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": { "": "src/" }
    }
}</pre> <h4 id="classmap">Classmap</h4> <p>The <code>classmap</code> references are all combined, during install/update, into a single key =&gt; value array which may be found in the generated file <code>vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php</code>. This map is built by scanning for classes in all <code>.php</code> and <code>.inc</code> files in the given directories/files.</p> <p>You can use the classmap generation support to define autoloading for all libraries that do not follow PSR-0/4. To configure this you specify all directories or files to search for classes.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "classmap": ["src/", "lib/", "Something.php"]
    }
}</pre> <p>Wildcards (<code>*</code>) are also supported in a classmap paths, and expand to match any directory name:</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "classmap": ["src/addons/*/lib/", "3rd-party/*", "Something.php"]
    }
}</pre> <h4 id="files">Files</h4> <p>If you want to require certain files explicitly on every request then you can use the <code>files</code> autoloading mechanism. This is useful if your package includes PHP functions that cannot be autoloaded by PHP.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "files": ["src/MyLibrary/functions.php"]
    }
}</pre> <p>Files autoload rules are included whenever <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> is included, right after the autoloader is registered. The order of inclusion depends on package dependencies so that if package A depends on B, files in package B will be included first to ensure package B is fully initialized and ready to be used when files from package A are included.</p> <p>If two packages have the same amount of dependents or no dependencies, the order is alphabetical.</p> <p>Files from the root package are always loaded last, and you cannot use files autoloading yourself to override functions from your dependencies. If you want to achieve that we recommend you include your own functions <em>before</em> including Composer's <code>vendor/autoload.php</code>.</p> <h4 id="exclude-files-from-classmaps">Exclude files from classmaps</h4> <p>If you want to exclude some files or folders from the classmap you can use the <code>exclude-from-classmap</code> property. This might be useful to exclude test classes in your live environment, for example, as those will be skipped from the classmap even when building an optimized autoloader.</p> <p>The classmap generator will ignore all files in the paths configured here. The paths are absolute from the package root directory (i.e. composer.json location), and support <code>*</code> to match anything but a slash, and <code>**</code> to match anything. <code>**</code> is implicitly added to the end of the paths.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "exclude-from-classmap": ["/Tests/", "/test/", "/tests/"]
    }
}</pre> <h4 id="optimizing-the-autoloader">Optimizing the autoloader</h4> <p>The autoloader can have quite a substantial impact on your request time (50-100ms per request in large frameworks using a lot of classes). See the <a href="articles/autoloader-optimization.md.html">article about optimizing the autoloader</a> for more details on how to reduce this impact.</p> <h3 id="autoload-dev">autoload-dev <span>(<a href="04-schema.md.html#root-package">root-only</a>)</span>
</h3> <p>This section allows defining autoload rules for development purposes.</p> <p>Classes needed to run the test suite should not be included in the main autoload rules to avoid polluting the autoloader in production and when other people use your package as a dependency.</p> <p>Therefore, it is a good idea to rely on a dedicated path for your unit tests and to add it within the autoload-dev section.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": { "MyLibrary\\": "src/" }
    },
    "autoload-dev": {
        "psr-4": { "MyLibrary\\Tests\\": "tests/" }
    }
}</pre> <h3 id="include-path">include-path</h3> <blockquote> <p><strong>DEPRECATED</strong>: This is only present to support legacy projects, and all new code should preferably use autoloading. As such it is a deprecated practice, but the feature itself will not likely disappear from Composer.</p> </blockquote> <p>A list of paths which should get appended to PHP's <code>include_path</code>.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "include-path": ["lib/"]
}</pre> <p>Optional.</p> <h3 id="target-dir">target-dir</h3> <blockquote> <p><strong>DEPRECATED</strong>: This is only present to support legacy PSR-0 style autoloading, and all new code should preferably use PSR-4 without target-dir and projects using PSR-0 with PHP namespaces are encouraged to migrate to PSR-4 instead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Defines the installation target.</p> <p>In case the package root is below the namespace declaration you cannot autoload properly. <code>target-dir</code> solves this problem.</p> <p>An example is Symfony. There are individual packages for the components. The Yaml component is under <code>Symfony\Component\Yaml</code>. The package root is that <code>Yaml</code> directory. To make autoloading possible, we need to make sure that it is not installed into <code>vendor/symfony/yaml</code>, but instead into <code>vendor/symfony/yaml/Symfony/Component/Yaml</code>, so that the autoloader can load it from <code>vendor/symfony/yaml</code>.</p> <p>To do that, <code>autoload</code> and <code>target-dir</code> are defined as follows:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": { "Symfony\\Component\\Yaml\\": "" }

</h3> <p>This defines the default behavior for filtering packages by stability. This defaults to <code>stable</code>, so if you rely on a <code>dev</code> package, you should specify it in your file to avoid surprises.</p> <p>All versions of each package are checked for stability, and those that are less stable than the <code>minimum-stability</code> setting will be ignored when resolving your project dependencies. (Note that you can also specify stability requirements on a per-package basis using stability flags in the version constraints that you specify in a <code>require</code> block (see <a href="#package-links">package links</a> for more details).</p> <p>Available options (in order of stability) are <code>dev</code>, <code>alpha</code>, <code>beta</code>, <code>RC</code>, and <code>stable</code>.</p> <h3 id="prefer-stable">prefer-stable <span>(<a href="04-schema.md.html#root-package">root-only</a>)</span>
</h3> <p>When this is enabled, Composer will prefer more stable packages over unstable ones when finding compatible stable packages is possible. If you require a dev version or only alphas are available for a package, those will still be selected granted that the minimum-stability allows for it.</p> <p>Use <code>"prefer-stable": true</code> to enable.</p> <h3 id="repositories">repositories <span>(<a href="04-schema.md.html#root-package">root-only</a>)</span>
</h3> <p>Custom package repositories to use.</p> <p>By default Composer only uses the packagist repository. By specifying repositories you can get packages from elsewhere.</p> <p>Repositories are not resolved recursively. You can only add them to your main <code>composer.json</code>. Repository declarations of dependencies' <code>composer.json</code>s are ignored.</p> <p>The following repository types are supported:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>composer:</strong> A Composer repository is a <code>packages.json</code> file served via the network (HTTP, FTP, SSH), that contains a list of <code>composer.json</code> objects with additional <code>dist</code> and/or <code>source</code> information. The <code>packages.json</code> file is loaded using a PHP stream. You can set extra options on that stream using the <code>options</code> parameter.</li> <li>
<strong>vcs:</strong> The version control system repository can fetch packages from git, svn, fossil and hg repositories.</li> <li>
<strong>package:</strong> If you depend on a project that does not have any support for Composer whatsoever you can define the package inline using a <code>package</code> repository. You basically inline the <code>composer.json</code> object.</li> </ul> <p>For more information on any of these, see <a href="05-repositories.md.html">Repositories</a>.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "http://packages.example.com"

        {

                    "url": "https://www.smarty.net/files/Smarty-3.1.7.zip",
                    "type": "zip"

                    "reference": "tags/Smarty_3_1_7/distribution/"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Order is significant here. When looking for a package, Composer will look from the first to the last repository, and pick the first match. By default Packagist is added last which means that custom repositories can override packages from it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Using JSON object notation is also possible. However, JSON key/value pairs are to be considered unordered so consistent behaviour cannot be guaranteed.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{

<strong>name:</strong> Allows configuring base name for archive. By default (if not configured, and <code>--file</code> is not passed as command-line argument), <code>preg_replace('#[^a-z0-9-_]#i', '-', name)</code> is used.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "name": "org/strangeName",
    "archive": {
        "name": "Strange_name"
    }
}</pre> <ul> <li>
<strong>exclude:</strong> Allows configuring a list of patterns for excluded paths. The pattern syntax matches .gitignore files. A leading exclamation mark (!) will result in any matching files to be included even if a previous pattern excluded them. A leading slash will only match at the beginning of the project relative path. An asterisk will not expand to a directory separator.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "archive": {

This is an array of strings.</p> <p>If you have non-numeric branch names, for example like "latest", "current", "latest-stable" or something, that do not look like a version number, then Composer handles such branches as feature branches. This means it searches for parent branches, that look like a version or ends at special branches (like master), and the root package version number becomes the version of the parent branch or at least master or something.</p> <p>To handle non-numeric named branches as versions instead of searching for a parent branch with a valid version or special branch name like master, you can set patterns for branch names that should be handled as dev version branches.</p> <p>This is really helpful when you have dependencies using "self.version", so that not dev-master, but the same branch is installed (in the example: latest-testing).</p> <p>An example:</p> <p>If you have a testing branch, that is heavily maintained during a testing phase and is deployed to your staging environment, normally <code>composer show -s</code> will give you <code>versions : * dev-master</code>.</p> <p>If you configure <code>latest-.*</code> as a pattern for non-feature-branches like this:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "non-feature-branches": ["latest-.*"]
}</pre> <p>Then <code>composer show -s</code> will give you <code>versions : * dev-latest-testing</code>.</p> <p>Optional.</p> <p class="prev-next">← <a href="03-cli.md.html">Command-line interface</a> | <a href="05-repositories.md.html">Repositories</a> →</p><div class="_attribution">
