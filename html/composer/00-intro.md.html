<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1> <p>Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.</p> <h2 id="dependency-management">Dependency management</h2> <p>Composer is <strong>not</strong> a package manager in the same sense as Yum or Apt are. Yes, it deals with "packages" or libraries, but it manages them on a per-project basis, installing them in a directory (e.g. <code>vendor</code>) inside your project. By default, it does not install anything globally. Thus, it is a dependency manager. It does however support a "global" project for convenience via the <a href="03-cli.md.html#global">global</a> command.</p> <p>This idea is not new and Composer is strongly inspired by node's <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> and ruby's <a href="https://bundler.io/">bundler</a>.</p> <p>Suppose:</p> <ol> <li>You have a project that depends on a number of libraries.</li> <li>Some of those libraries depend on other libraries.</li> </ol> <p>Composer:</p> <ol> <li>Enables you to declare the libraries you depend on.</li> <li>Finds out which versions of which packages can and need to be installed, and installs them (meaning it downloads them into your project).</li> <li>You can update all your dependencies in one command.</li> </ol> <p>See the <a href="01-basic-usage.md.html">Basic usage</a> chapter for more details on declaring dependencies.</p> <h2 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h2> <p>Composer in its latest version requires PHP 7.2.5 to run. A long-term-support version (2.2.x) still offers support for PHP 5.3.2+ in case you are stuck with a legacy PHP version. A few sensitive php settings and compile flags are also required, but when using the installer you will be warned about any incompatibilities.</p> <p>To install packages from sources instead of plain zip archives, you will need git, svn, fossil or hg depending on how the package is version-controlled.</p> <p>Composer is multi-platform and we strive to make it run equally well on Windows, Linux and macOS.</p> <h2 id="installation-linux-unix-macos">Installation - Linux / Unix / macOS</h2> <h3 id="downloading-the-composer-executable">Downloading the Composer Executable</h3> <p>Composer offers a convenient installer that you can execute directly from the command line. Feel free to <a href="https://getcomposer.org/installer">download this file</a> or review it on <a href="https://github.com/composer/getcomposer.org/blob/main/web/installer">GitHub</a> if you wish to know more about the inner workings of the installer. The source is plain PHP.</p> <p>There are, in short, two ways to install Composer. Locally as part of your project, or globally as a system wide executable.</p> <h4 id="locally">Locally</h4> <p>To install Composer locally, run the installer in your project directory. See <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">the Download page</a> for instructions.</p> <p>The installer will check a few PHP settings and then download <code>composer.phar</code> to your working directory. This file is the Composer binary. It is a PHAR (PHP archive), which is an archive format for PHP which can be run on the command line, amongst other things.</p> <p>Now run <code>php composer.phar</code> in order to run Composer.</p> <p>You can install Composer to a specific directory by using the <code>--install-dir</code> option and additionally (re)name it as well using the <code>--filename</code> option. When running the installer when following <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">the Download page instructions</a> add the following parameters:</p> <pre>php composer-setup.php --install-dir=bin --filename=composer</pre> <p>Now run <code>php bin/composer</code> in order to run Composer.</p> <h4 id="globally">Globally</h4> <p>You can place the Composer PHAR anywhere you wish. If you put it in a directory that is part of your <code>PATH</code>, you can access it globally. On Unix systems you can even make it executable and invoke it without directly using the <code>php</code> interpreter.</p> <p>After running the installer following <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">the Download page instructions</a> you can run this to move composer.phar to a directory that is in your path:</p> <pre>mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer</pre> <p>If you like to install it only for your user and avoid requiring root permissions, you can use <code>~/.local/bin</code> instead which is available by default on some Linux distributions.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the above fails due to permissions, you may need to run it again with <code>sudo</code>.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> On some versions of macOS the <code>/usr</code> directory does not exist by default. If you receive the error "/usr/local/bin/composer: No such file or directory" then you must create the directory manually before proceeding: <code>mkdir -p /usr/local/bin</code>.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> For information on changing your PATH, please read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">Wikipedia article</a> and/or use your search engine of choice.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now run <code>composer</code> in order to run Composer instead of <code>php composer.phar</code>.</p> <h2 id="installation-windows">Installation - Windows</h2> <h3 id="using-the-installer">Using the Installer</h3> <p>This is the easiest way to get Composer set up on your machine.</p> <p>Download and run <a href="https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe">Composer-Setup.exe</a>. It will install the latest Composer version and set up your PATH so that you can call <code>composer</code> from any directory in your command line.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Close your current terminal. Test usage with a new terminal: This is important since the PATH only gets loaded when the terminal starts.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="manual-installation">Manual Installation</h3> <p>Change to a directory on your <code>PATH</code> and run the installer following <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">the Download page instructions</a> to download <code>composer.phar</code>.</p> <p>Create a new <code>composer.bat</code> file alongside <code>composer.phar</code>:</p> <p>Using cmd.exe:</p> <pre>C:\bin&gt; echo @php "%~dp0composer.phar" %*&gt;composer.bat</pre> <p>Using PowerShell:</p> <pre>PS C:\bin&gt; Set-Content composer.bat '@php "%~dp0composer.phar" %*'</pre> <p>Add the directory to your PATH environment variable if it isn't already. For information on changing your PATH variable, please see <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm">this article</a> and/or use your search engine of choice.</p> <p>Close your current terminal. Test usage with a new terminal:</p> <pre>C:\Users\username&gt;composer -V</pre> <pre>Composer version 2.4.0 2022-08-16 16:10:48</pre> <h2 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h2> <p>Composer is published as Docker container in a few places, see the list in the <a href="https://github.com/composer/docker">composer/docker README</a>.</p> <p>Example usage:</p> <pre>docker pull composer/composer
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/app" composer/composer install</pre> <p>To add Composer to an existing <strong>Dockerfile</strong>:</p> <pre>COPY --from=composer/composer /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer</pre> <p>Read the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/composer/composer">image description</a> for further usage information.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Docker specific issues should be filed <a href="https://github.com/composer/docker/issues">on the composer/docker repository</a>.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may also use <code>composer</code> instead of <code>composer/composer</code> as image name above. It is shorter and is a Docker official image but is not published directly by us and thus usually receives new releases with a delay of a few days.</p> <h2 id="using-composer">Using Composer</h2> <p>Now that you've installed Composer, you are ready to use it!
