<h1 id="basic-usage">Basic usage</h1> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>For our basic usage introduction, we will be installing <code>monolog/monolog</code>, a logging library. If you have not yet installed Composer, refer to the <a href="00-intro.md.html">Intro</a> chapter.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> for the sake of simplicity, this introduction will assume you have performed a <a href="00-intro.md.html#locally">local</a> install of Composer.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="composer-json-project-setup">
<code>composer.json</code>: Project setup</h2> <p>To start using Composer in your project, all you need is a <code>composer.json</code> file. This file describes the dependencies of your project and may contain other metadata as well. It typically should go in the top-most directory of your project/VCS repository. You can technically run Composer anywhere but if you want to publish a package to Packagist.org, it will have to be able to find the file at the top of your VCS repository.</p> <h3 id="the-require-key">The <code>require</code> key</h3> <p>The first thing you specify in <code>composer.json</code> is the <a href="04-schema.md.html#require"><code>require</code></a> key. You are telling Composer which packages your project depends on.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "2.0.*"
    }
}</pre> <p>As you can see, <a href="04-schema.md.html#require"><code>require</code></a> takes an object that maps <strong>package names</strong> (e.g. <code>monolog/monolog</code>) to <strong>version constraints</strong> (e.g. <code>1.0.*</code>).</p> <p>Composer uses this information to search for the right set of files in package "repositories" that you register using the <a href="04-schema.md.html#repositories"><code>repositories</code></a> key, or in <a href="https://packagist.org">Packagist.org</a>, the default package repository. In the above example, since no other repository has been registered in the <code>composer.json</code> file, it is assumed that the <code>monolog/monolog</code> package is registered on Packagist.org. (Read more <a href="#packagist">about Packagist</a>, and <a href="05-repositories.md.html">about repositories</a>).</p> <h3 id="package-names">Package names</h3> <p>The package name consists of a vendor name and the project's name. Often these will be identical - the vendor name only exists to prevent naming clashes. For example, it would allow two different people to create a library named <code>json</code>. One might be named <code>igorw/json</code> while the other might be <code>seldaek/json</code>.</p> <p>Read more about <a href="02-libraries.md.html">publishing packages and package naming</a>. (Note that you can also specify "platform packages" as dependencies, allowing you to require certain versions of server software. See <a href="#platform-packages">platform packages</a> below.)</p> <h3 id="package-version-constraints">Package version constraints</h3> <p>In our example, we are requesting the Monolog package with the version constraint <a href="https://semver.mwl.be/#?package=monolog%2Fmonolog&amp;version=2.0.*"><code>2.0.*</code></a>. This means any version in the <code>2.0</code> development branch, or any version that is greater than or equal to 2.0 and less than 2.1 (<code>&gt;=2.0 &lt;2.1</code>).</p> <p>Please read <a href="articles/versions.md.html">versions</a> for more in-depth information on versions, how versions relate to each other, and on version constraints.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>How does Composer download the right files?</strong> When you specify a dependency in <code>composer.json</code>, Composer first takes the name of the package that you have requested and searches for it in any repositories that you have registered using the <a href="04-schema.md.html#repositories"><code>repositories</code></a> key. If you have not registered any extra repositories, or it does not find a package with that name in the repositories you have specified, it falls back to Packagist.org (more <a href="#packagist">below</a>).</p> <p>When Composer finds the right package, either in Packagist.org or in a repo you have specified, it then uses the versioning features of the package's VCS (i.e., branches and tags) to attempt to find the best match for the version constraint you have specified. Be sure to read about versions and package resolution in the <a href="articles/versions.md.html">versions article</a>.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are trying to require a package but Composer throws an error regarding package stability, the version you have specified may not meet your default minimum stability requirements. By default, only stable releases are taken into consideration when searching for valid package versions in your VCS.</p> <p>You might run into this if you are trying to require dev, alpha, beta, or RC versions of a package. Read more about stability flags and the <code>minimum-stability</code> key on the <a href="04-schema.md.html">schema page</a>.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="installing-dependencies">Installing dependencies</h2> <p>To initially install the defined dependencies for your project, you should run the <a href="03-cli.md.html#update-u"><code>update</code></a> command.</p> <pre>php composer.phar update</pre> <p>This will make Composer do two things:</p> <ul> <li>It resolves all dependencies listed in your <code>composer.json</code> file and writes all of the packages and their exact versions to the <code>composer.lock</code> file, locking the project to those specific versions. You should commit the <code>composer.lock</code> file to your project repo so that all people working on the project are locked to the same versions of dependencies (more below). This is the main role of the <code>update</code> command.</li> <li>It then implicitly runs the <a href="03-cli.md.html#install-i"><code>install</code></a> command. This will download the dependencies' files into the <code>vendor</code> directory in your project. (The <code>vendor</code> directory is the conventional location for all third-party code in a project). In our example from above, you would end up with the Monolog source files in <code>vendor/monolog/monolog/</code>. As Monolog has a dependency on <code>psr/log</code>, that package's files can also be found inside <code>vendor/</code>.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you are using git for your project, you probably want to add <code>vendor</code> in your <code>.gitignore</code>. You really don't want to add all of that third-party code to your versioned repository.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="commit-your-composer-lock-file-to-version-control">Commit your <code>composer.lock</code> file to version control</h3> <p>Committing this file to version control is important because it will cause anyone who sets up the project to use the exact same versions of the dependencies that you are using. Your CI server, production machines, other developers in your team, everything and everyone runs on the same dependencies, which mitigates the potential for bugs affecting only some parts of the deployments. Even if you develop alone, in six months when reinstalling the project you can feel confident the dependencies installed are still working even if your dependencies released many new versions since then. (See note below about using the <code>update</code> command.)</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> For libraries it is not necessary to commit the lock file, see also: <a href="02-libraries.md.html#lock-file">Libraries - Lock file</a>.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="installing-from-composer-lock">Installing from <code>composer.lock</code>
</h3> <p>If there is already a <code>composer.lock</code> file in the project folder, it means either you ran the <code>update</code> command before, or someone else on the project ran the <code>update</code> command and committed the <code>composer.lock</code> file to the project (which is good).</p> <p>Either way, running <code>install</code> when a <code>composer.lock</code> file is present resolves and installs all dependencies that you listed in <code>composer.json</code>, but Composer uses the exact versions listed in <code>composer.lock</code> to ensure that the package versions are consistent for everyone working on your project. As a result you will have all dependencies requested by your <code>composer.json</code> file, but they may not all be at the very latest available versions (some of the dependencies listed in the <code>composer.lock</code> file may have released newer versions since the file was created). This is by design, it ensures that your project does not break because of unexpected changes in dependencies.</p> <p>So after fetching new changes from your VCS repository it is recommended to run a Composer <code>install</code> to make sure the vendor directory is up in sync with your <code>composer.lock</code> file.</p> <pre>php composer.phar install</pre> <h2 id="updating-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions">Updating dependencies to their latest versions</h2> <p>As mentioned above, the <code>composer.lock</code> file prevents you from automatically getting the latest versions of your dependencies. To update to the latest versions, use the <a href="03-cli.md.html#update-u"><code>update</code></a> command. This will fetch the latest matching versions (according to your <code>composer.json</code> file) and update the lock file with the new versions.</p> <pre>php composer.phar update</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Composer will display a Warning when executing an <code>install</code> command if the <code>composer.lock</code> has not been updated since changes were made to the <code>composer.json</code> that might affect dependency resolution.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you only want to install, upgrade or remove one dependency, you can explicitly list it as an argument:</p> <pre>php composer.phar update monolog/monolog [...]</pre> <h2 id="packagist">Packagist</h2> <p><a href="https://packagist.org/">Packagist.org</a> is the main Composer repository. A Composer repository is basically a package source: a place where you can get packages from. Packagist aims to be the central repository that everybody uses. This means that you can automatically <code>require</code> any package that is available there, without further specifying where Composer should look for the package.</p> <p>If you go to the <a href="https://packagist.org/">Packagist.org website</a>, you can browse and search for packages.</p> <p>Any open source project using Composer is recommended to publish their packages on Packagist. A library does not need to be on Packagist to be used by Composer, but it enables discovery and adoption by other developers more quickly.</p> <h2 id="platform-packages">Platform packages</h2> <p>Composer has platform packages, which are virtual packages for things that are installed on the system but are not actually installable by Composer. This includes PHP itself, PHP extensions and some system libraries.</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>php</code> represents the PHP version of the user, allowing you to apply constraints, e.g. <code>^7.1</code>. To require a 64bit version of php, you can require the <code>php-64bit</code> package.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>hhvm</code> represents the version of the HHVM runtime and allows you to apply a constraint, e.g., <code>^2.3</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ext-&lt;name&gt;</code> allows you to require PHP extensions (includes core extensions). Versioning can be quite inconsistent here, so it's often a good idea to set the constraint to <code>*</code>. An example of an extension package name is <code>ext-gd</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>lib-&lt;name&gt;</code> allows constraints to be made on versions of libraries used by PHP. The following are available: <code>curl</code>, <code>iconv</code>, <code>icu</code>, <code>libxml</code>, <code>openssl</code>, <code>pcre</code>, <code>uuid</code>, <code>xsl</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use <a href="03-cli.md.html#show"><code>show --platform</code></a> to get a list of your locally available platform packages.</p> <h2 id="autoloading">Autoloading</h2> <p>For libraries that specify autoload information, Composer generates a <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> file. You can include this file and start using the classes that those libraries provide without any extra work:</p> <pre data-language="php">require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$log = new Monolog\Logger('name');
$log-&gt;pushHandler(new Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler('app.log', Monolog\Logger::WARNING));
$log-&gt;warning('Foo');</pre> <p>You can even add your own code to the autoloader by adding an <a href="04-schema.md.html#autoload"><code>autoload</code></a> field to <code>composer.json</code>.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {"Acme\\": "src/"}
    }
}</pre> <p>Composer will register a <a href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR-4</a> autoloader for the <code>Acme</code> namespace.</p> <p>You define a mapping from namespaces to directories. The <code>src</code> directory would be in your project root, on the same level as the <code>vendor</code> directory. An example filename would be <code>src/Foo.php</code> containing an <code>Acme\Foo</code> class.</p> <p>After adding the <a href="04-schema.md.html#autoload"><code>autoload</code></a> field, you have to re-run this command:</p> <pre>php composer.phar dump-autoload</pre> <p>This command will re-generate the <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> file. See the <a href="03-cli.md.html#dump-autoload-dumpautoload-"><code>dump-autoload</code></a> section for more information.</p> <p>Including that file will also return the autoloader instance, so you can store the return value of the include call in a variable and add more namespaces. This can be useful for autoloading classes in a test suite, for example.</p> <pre data-language="php">$loader = require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
$loader-&gt;addPsr4('Acme\\Test\\', __DIR__);</pre> <p>In addition to PSR-4 autoloading, Composer also supports PSR-0, classmap and files autoloading. See the <a href="04-schema.md.html#autoload"><code>autoload</code></a> reference for more information.</p> <p>See also the docs on <a href="articles/autoloader-optimization.md.html">optimizing the autoloader</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Composer provides its own autoloader. If you don't want to use that one, you can include <code>vendor/composer/autoload_*.php</code> files, which return associative arrays allowing you to configure your own autoloader.</p> </blockquote> <p class="prev-next">← <a href="00-intro.md.html">Intro</a> | <a href="02-libraries.md.html">Libraries</a> →</p><div class="_attribution">
