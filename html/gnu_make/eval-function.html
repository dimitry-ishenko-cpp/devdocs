  <h1 class="section">The eval Function</h1>    <p>The <code>eval</code> function is very special: it allows you to define new makefile constructs that are not constant; which are the result of evaluating other variables and functions. The argument to the <code>eval</code> function is expanded, then the results of that expansion are parsed as makefile syntax. The expanded results can define new <code>make</code> variables, targets, implicit or explicit rules, etc. </p> <p>The result of the <code>eval</code> function is always the empty string; thus, it can be placed virtually anywhere in a makefile without causing syntax errors. </p> <p>It’s important to realize that the <code>eval</code> argument is expanded <em>twice</em>; first by the <code>eval</code> function, then the results of that expansion are expanded again when they are parsed as makefile syntax. This means you may need to provide extra levels of escaping for “$” characters when using <code>eval</code>. The <code>value</code> function (see <a href="value-function.html">Value Function</a>) can sometimes be useful in these situations, to circumvent unwanted expansions. </p> <p>Here is an example of how <code>eval</code> can be used; this example combines a number of concepts and other functions. Although it might seem overly complex to use <code>eval</code> in this example, rather than just writing out the rules, consider two things: first, the template definition (in <code>PROGRAM_template</code>) could need to be much more complex than it is here; and second, you might put the complex, “generic” part of this example into another makefile, then include it in all the individual makefiles. Now your individual makefiles are quite straightforward. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">PROGRAMS    = server client

server_OBJS = server.o server_priv.o server_access.o
server_LIBS = priv protocol

client_OBJS = client.o client_api.o client_mem.o
