  <h1 class="section">Suffix Rules for Archive Files</h1>     <p>You can write a special kind of suffix rule for dealing with archive files. See <a href="suffix-rules.html">Suffix Rules</a>, for a full explanation of suffix rules. Archive suffix rules are obsolete in GNU <code>make</code>, because pattern rules for archives are a more general mechanism (see <a href="archive-update.html">Archive Update</a>). But they are retained for compatibility with other <code>make</code>s. </p> <p>To write a suffix rule for archives, you simply write a suffix rule using the target suffix ‘<samp>.a</samp>’ (the usual suffix for archive files). For example, here is the old-fashioned suffix rule to update a library archive from C source files: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">.c.a:
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $*.o
        $(AR) r $@ $*.o
        $(RM) $*.o
</pre>
</div> <p>This works just as if you had written the pattern rule: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(%.o): %.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $*.o
        $(AR) r $@ $*.o
        $(RM) $*.o
</pre>
</div> <p>In fact, this is just what <code>make</code> does when it sees a suffix rule with ‘<samp>.a</samp>’ as the target suffix. Any double-suffix rule ‘<samp>.<var>x</var>.a</samp>’ is converted to a pattern rule with the target pattern ‘<samp>(%.o)</samp>’ and a prerequisite pattern of ‘<samp>%.<var>x</var></samp>’. </p> <p>Since you might want to use ‘<samp>.a</samp>’ as the suffix for some other kind of file, <code>make</code> also converts archive suffix rules to pattern rules in the normal way (see <a href="suffix-rules.html">Suffix Rules</a>). Thus a double-suffix rule ‘<samp>.<var>x</var>.a</samp>’ produces two pattern rules: ‘<samp>(%.o): %.<var>x</var></samp>’ and ‘<samp>%.a: %.<var>x</var></samp>’. </p><div class="_attribution">
