  <h1 class="section">The value Function</h1>   <p>The <code>value</code> function provides a way for you to use the value of a variable <em>without</em> having it expanded. Please note that this does not undo expansions which have already occurred; for example if you create a simply expanded variable its value is expanded during the definition; in that case the <code>value</code> function will return the same result as using the variable directly. </p> <p>The syntax of the <code>value</code> function is: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">$(value <var>variable</var>)
</pre>
</div> <p>Note that <var>variable</var> is the <em>name</em> of a variable, not a <em>reference</em> to that variable. Therefore you would not normally use a ‘<samp>$</samp>’ or parentheses when writing it. (You can, however, use a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.) </p> <p>The result of this function is a string containing the value of <var>variable</var>, without any expansion occurring. For example, in this makefile: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">FOO = $PATH

all:
        @echo $(FOO)
        @echo $(value FOO)
</pre>
</div> <p>The first output line would be <code>ATH</code>, since the “$P” would be expanded as a <code>make</code> variable, while the second output line would be the current value of your <code>$PATH</code> environment variable, since the <code>value</code> function avoided the expansion. </p> <p>The <code>value</code> function is most often used in conjunction with the <code>eval</code> function (see <a href="eval-function.html">Eval Function</a>). </p><div class="_attribution">
