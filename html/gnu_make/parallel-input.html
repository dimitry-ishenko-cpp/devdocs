  <h1 class="subsection">Input During Parallel Execution</h1>    <p>Two processes cannot both take input from the same device at the same time. To make sure that only one recipe tries to take input from the terminal at once, <code>make</code> will invalidate the standard input streams of all but one running recipe. If another recipe attempts to read from standard input it will usually incur a fatal error (a ‘<samp>Broken pipe</samp>’ signal).  </p> <p>It is unpredictable which recipe will have a valid standard input stream (which will come from the terminal, or wherever you redirect the standard input of <code>make</code>). The first recipe run will always get it first, and the first recipe started after that one finishes will get it next, and so on. </p> <p>We will change how this aspect of <code>make</code> works if we find a better alternative. In the mean time, you should not rely on any recipe using standard input at all if you are using the parallel execution feature; but if you are not using this feature, then standard input works normally in all recipes. </p><div class="_attribution">
