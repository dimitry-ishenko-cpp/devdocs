  <h1 class="section">Letting make Deduce the Recipes</h1>    <p>It is not necessary to spell out the recipes for compiling the individual C source files, because <code>make</code> can figure them out: it has an <em>implicit rule</em> for updating a ‘<samp>.o</samp>’ file from a correspondingly named ‘<samp>.c</samp>’ file using a ‘<samp>cc -c</samp>’ command. For example, it will use the recipe ‘<samp>cc -c main.c -o main.o</samp>’ to compile <samp>main.c</samp> into <samp>main.o</samp>. We can therefore omit the recipes from the rules for the object files. See <a href="implicit-rules.html">Using Implicit Rules</a>. </p> <p>When a ‘<samp>.c</samp>’ file is used automatically in this way, it is also automatically added to the list of prerequisites. We can therefore omit the ‘<samp>.c</samp>’ files from the prerequisites, provided we omit the recipe. </p> <p>Here is the entire example, with both of these changes, and a variable <code>objects</code> as suggested above: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

edit : $(objects)
        cc -o edit $(objects)

main.o : defs.h
kbd.o : defs.h command.h
command.o : defs.h command.h
display.o : defs.h buffer.h
insert.o : defs.h buffer.h
search.o : defs.h buffer.h
files.o : defs.h buffer.h command.h
utils.o : defs.h

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm edit $(objects)
</pre>
</div> <p>This is how we would write the makefile in actual practice. (The complications associated with ‘<samp>clean</samp>’ are described elsewhere. See <a href="phony-targets.html">Phony Targets</a>, and <a href="errors.html">Errors in Recipes</a>.) </p> <p>Because implicit rules are so convenient, they are important. You will see them used frequently. </p><div class="_attribution">
