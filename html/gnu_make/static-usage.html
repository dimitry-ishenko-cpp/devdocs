  <h1 class="subsection">Syntax of Static Pattern Rules</h1>   <p>Here is the syntax of a static pattern rule: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example"><var>targets</var> …: <var>target-pattern</var>: <var>prereq-patterns</var> …
        <var>recipe</var>
        …
</pre>
</div> <p>The <var>targets</var> list specifies the targets that the rule applies to. The targets can contain wildcard characters, just like the targets of ordinary rules (see <a href="wildcards.html">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</a>). </p>   <p>The <var>target-pattern</var> and <var>prereq-patterns</var> say how to compute the prerequisites of each target. Each target is matched against the <var>target-pattern</var> to extract a part of the target name, called the <em>stem</em>. This stem is substituted into each of the <var>prereq-patterns</var> to make the prerequisite names (one from each <var>prereq-pattern</var>). </p> <p>Each pattern normally contains the character ‘<samp>%</samp>’ just once. When the <var>target-pattern</var> matches a target, the ‘<samp>%</samp>’ can match any part of the target name; this part is called the <em>stem</em>. The rest of the pattern must match exactly. For example, the target <samp>foo.o</samp> matches the pattern ‘<samp>%.o</samp>’, with ‘<samp>foo</samp>’ as the stem. The targets <samp>foo.c</samp> and <samp>foo.out</samp> do not match that pattern. </p>  <p>The prerequisite names for each target are made by substituting the stem for the ‘<samp>%</samp>’ in each prerequisite pattern. For example, if one prerequisite pattern is <samp>%.c</samp>, then substitution of the stem ‘<samp>foo</samp>’ gives the prerequisite name <samp>foo.c</samp>. It is legitimate to write a prerequisite pattern that does not contain ‘<samp>%</samp>’; then this prerequisite is the same for all targets. </p>      <p>‘<samp>%</samp>’ characters in pattern rules can be quoted with preceding backslashes (‘<samp>\</samp>’). Backslashes that would otherwise quote ‘<samp>%</samp>’ characters can be quoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote ‘<samp>%</samp>’ characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared to file names or has a stem substituted into it. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting ‘<samp>%</samp>’ characters go unmolested. For example, the pattern <samp>the\%weird\\%pattern\\</samp> has ‘<samp>the%weird\</samp>’ preceding the operative ‘<samp>%</samp>’ character, and ‘<samp>pattern\\</samp>’ following it. The final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect any ‘<samp>%</samp>’ character. </p> <p>Here is an example, which compiles each of <samp>foo.o</samp> and <samp>bar.o</samp> from the corresponding <samp>.c</samp> file: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">objects = foo.o bar.o

all: $(objects)

$(objects): %.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@
</pre>
</div> <p>Here ‘<samp>$&lt;</samp>’ is the automatic variable that holds the name of the prerequisite and ‘<samp>$@</samp>’ is the automatic variable that holds the name of the target; see <a href="automatic-variables.html">Automatic Variables</a>. </p> <p>Each target specified must match the target pattern; a warning is issued for each target that does not. If you have a list of files, only some of which will match the pattern, you can use the <code>filter</code> function to remove non-matching file names (see <a href="text-functions.html">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</a>): </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">files = foo.elc bar.o lose.o

$(filter %.o,$(files)): %.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@
$(filter %.elc,$(files)): %.elc: %.el
        emacs -f batch-byte-compile $&lt;
</pre>
</div> <p>In this example the result of ‘<samp>$(filter %.o,$(files))</samp>’ is <samp>bar.o lose.o</samp>, and the first static pattern rule causes each of these object files to be updated by compiling the corresponding C source file. The result of ‘<samp>$(filter %.elc,$(files))</samp>’ is <samp>foo.elc</samp>, so that file is made from <samp>foo.el</samp>. </p> <p>Another example shows how to use <code>$*</code> in static pattern rules:  </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">bigoutput littleoutput : %output : text.g
        generate text.g -$* &gt; $@
</pre>
</div> <p>When the <code>generate</code> command is run, <code>$*</code> will expand to the stem, either ‘<samp>big</samp>’ or ‘<samp>little</samp>’. </p><div class="_attribution">
