  <h4 class="node-heading">Preparing</h4> <h3 class="heading">Preparing and Running Make</h3> <p>To prepare to use <code>make</code>, you must write a file called the <em>makefile</em> that describes the relationships among files in your program and provides commands for updating each file. In a program, typically, the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files. </p> <p>Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this simple shell command: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">make
</pre>
</div> <p>suffices to perform all necessary recompilations. The <code>make</code> program uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated. For each of those files, it issues the recipes recorded in the data base. </p> <p>You can provide command line arguments to <code>make</code> to control which files should be recompiled, or how. See <a href="running.html">How to Run <code>make</code></a>. </p><div class="_attribution">
