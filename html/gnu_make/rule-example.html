  <h1 class="section">Rule Example</h1> <p>Here is an example of a rule: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">foo.o : foo.c defs.h       # module for twiddling the frobs
        cc -c -g foo.c
</pre>
</div> <p>Its target is <samp>foo.o</samp> and its prerequisites are <samp>foo.c</samp> and <samp>defs.h</samp>. It has one command in the recipe: ‘<samp>cc -c -g foo.c</samp>’. The recipe starts with a tab to identify it as a recipe. </p> <p>This rule says two things: </p> <ul> <li> How to decide whether <samp>foo.o</samp> is out of date: it is out of date if it does not exist, or if either <samp>foo.c</samp> or <samp>defs.h</samp> is more recent than it. </li>
<li> How to update the file <samp>foo.o</samp>: by running <code>cc</code> as stated. The recipe does not explicitly mention <samp>defs.h</samp>, but we presume that <samp>foo.c</samp> includes it, and that is why <samp>defs.h</samp> was added to the prerequisites. </li>
