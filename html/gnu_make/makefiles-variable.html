  <h1 class="section">The Variable MAKEFILES</h1>    <p>If the environment variable <code>MAKEFILES</code> is defined, <code>make</code> considers its value as a list of names (separated by whitespace) of additional makefiles to be read before the others. This works much like the <code>include</code> directive: various directories are searched for those files (see <a href="include.html">Including Other Makefiles</a>). In addition, the default goal is never taken from one of these makefiles (or any makefile included by them) and it is not an error if the files listed in <code>MAKEFILES</code> are not found. </p>  <p>The main use of <code>MAKEFILES</code> is in communication between recursive invocations of <code>make</code> (see <a href="recursion.html">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>). It usually is not desirable to set the environment variable before a top-level invocation of <code>make</code>, because it is usually better not to mess with a makefile from outside. However, if you are running <code>make</code> without a specific makefile, a makefile in <code>MAKEFILES</code> can do useful things to help the built-in implicit rules work better, such as defining search paths (see <a href="directory-search.html">Directory Search</a>). </p> <p>Some users are tempted to set <code>MAKEFILES</code> in the environment automatically on login, and program makefiles to expect this to be done. This is a very bad idea, because such makefiles will fail to work if run by anyone else. It is much better to write explicit <code>include</code> directives in the makefiles. See <a href="include.html">Including Other Makefiles</a>. </p><div class="_attribution">
