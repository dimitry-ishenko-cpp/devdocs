  <h1 class="section">Rules without Recipes or Prerequisites</h1>     <p>If a rule has no prerequisites or recipe, and the target of the rule is a nonexistent file, then <code>make</code> imagines this target to have been updated whenever its rule is run. This implies that all targets depending on this one will always have their recipe run. </p> <p>An example will illustrate this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">clean: FORCE
        rm $(objects)
FORCE:
</pre>
</div> <p>Here the target ‘<samp>FORCE</samp>’ satisfies the special conditions, so the target <samp>clean</samp> that depends on it is forced to run its recipe. There is nothing special about the name ‘<samp>FORCE</samp>’, but that is one name commonly used this way. </p> <p>As you can see, using ‘<samp>FORCE</samp>’ this way has the same results as using ‘<samp>.PHONY: clean</samp>’. </p> <p>Using ‘<samp>.PHONY</samp>’ is more explicit and more efficient. However, other versions of <code>make</code> do not support ‘<samp>.PHONY</samp>’; thus ‘<samp>FORCE</samp>’ appears in many makefiles.
