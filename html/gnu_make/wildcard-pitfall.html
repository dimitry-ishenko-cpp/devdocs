  <h1 class="subsection">Pitfalls of Using Wildcards</h1>      <p>Now here is an example of a naive way of using wildcard expansion, that does not do what you would intend. Suppose you would like to say that the executable file <samp>foo</samp> is made from all the object files in the directory, and you write this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">objects = *.o

foo : $(objects)
        cc -o foo $(CFLAGS) $(objects)
</pre>
</div> <p>The value of <code>objects</code> is the actual string ‘<samp>*.o</samp>’. Wildcard expansion happens in the rule for <samp>foo</samp>, so that each <em>existing</em> ‘<samp>.o</samp>’ file becomes a prerequisite of <samp>foo</samp> and will be recompiled if necessary. </p> <p>But what if you delete all the ‘<samp>.o</samp>’ files? When a wildcard matches no files, it is left as it is, so then <samp>foo</samp> will depend on the oddly-named file <samp>*.o</samp>. Since no such file is likely to exist, <code>make</code> will give you an error saying it cannot figure out how to make <samp>*.o</samp>. This is not what you want! </p> <p>Actually it is possible to obtain the desired result with wildcard expansion, but you need more sophisticated techniques, including the <code>wildcard</code> function and string substitution. See <a href="wildcard-function.html">The Function <code>wildcard</code></a>. </p>   <p>Microsoft operating systems (MS-DOS and MS-Windows) use backslashes to separate directories in pathnames, like so: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">  c:\foo\bar\baz.c
</pre>
</div> <p>This is equivalent to the Unix-style <samp>c:/foo/bar/baz.c</samp> (the <samp>c:</samp> part is the so-called drive letter). When <code>make</code> runs on these systems, it supports backslashes as well as the Unix-style forward slashes in pathnames. However, this support does <em>not</em> include the wildcard expansion, where backslash is a quote character. Therefore, you <em>must</em> use Unix-style slashes in these cases. </p><div class="_attribution">
