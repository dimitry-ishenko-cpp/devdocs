  <h1 class="subsection">Using Variables in Recipes</h1>   <p>The other way in which <code>make</code> processes recipes is by expanding any variable references in them (see <a href="reference.html">Basics of Variable References</a>). This occurs after make has finished reading all the makefiles and the target is determined to be out of date; so, the recipes for targets which are not rebuilt are never expanded. </p> <p>Variable and function references in recipes have identical syntax and semantics to references elsewhere in the makefile. They also have the same quoting rules: if you want a dollar sign to appear in your recipe, you must double it (‘<samp>$$</samp>’). For shells like the default shell, that use dollar signs to introduce variables, it’s important to keep clear in your mind whether the variable you want to reference is a <code>make</code> variable (use a single dollar sign) or a shell variable (use two dollar signs). For example: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">LIST = one two three
all:
        for i in $(LIST); do \
            echo $$i; \
        done
</pre>
</div> <p>results in the following command being passed to the shell: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">for i in one two three; do \
    echo $i; \
done
</pre>
</div> <p>which generates the expected result: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">one
two
three
</pre>
