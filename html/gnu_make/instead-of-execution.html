  <h1 class="section">Instead of Executing Recipes</h1>   <p>The makefile tells <code>make</code> how to tell whether a target is up to date, and how to update each target. But updating the targets is not always what you want. Certain options specify other activities for <code>make</code>. </p> <dl compact> <dt id="-n">‘<samp>-n</samp>’</dt> <dt id="--just-print">‘<samp>--just-print</samp>’</dt> <dt id="--dry-run">‘<samp>--dry-run</samp>’</dt> <dt id="--recon">‘<samp>--recon</samp>’</dt> <dd>
    <p>“No-op”. Causes <code>make</code> to print the recipes that are needed to make the targets up to date, but not actually execute them. Note that some recipes are still executed, even with this flag (see <a href="make-variable.html">How the <code>MAKE</code> Variable Works</a>). Also any recipes needed to update included makefiles are still executed (see <a href="remaking-makefiles.html">How Makefiles Are Remade</a>). </p> </dd> <dt id="-t">‘<samp>-t</samp>’</dt> <dt id="--touch">‘<samp>--touch</samp>’</dt> <dd>
    <p>“Touch”. Marks targets as up to date without actually changing them. In other words, <code>make</code> pretends to update the targets but does not really change their contents; instead only their modified times are updated. </p> </dd> <dt id="-q">‘<samp>-q</samp>’</dt> <dt id="--question">‘<samp>--question</samp>’</dt> <dd>
   <p>“Question”. Silently check whether the targets are up to date, but do not execute recipes; the exit code shows whether any updates are needed. </p> </dd> <dt id="-W file">‘<samp>-W <var>file</var></samp>’</dt> <dt id="--what-if=file">‘<samp>--what-if=<var>file</var></samp>’</dt> <dt id="--assume-new=file">‘<samp>--assume-new=<var>file</var></samp>’</dt> <dt id="--new-file=file">‘<samp>--new-file=<var>file</var></samp>’</dt> <dd>
      <p>“What if”. Each ‘<samp>-W</samp>’ flag is followed by a file name. The given files’ modification times are recorded by <code>make</code> as being the present time, although the actual modification times remain the same. You can use the ‘<samp>-W</samp>’ flag in conjunction with the ‘<samp>-n</samp>’ flag to see what would happen if you were to modify specific files. </p>
</dd> </dl> <p>With the ‘<samp>-n</samp>’ flag, <code>make</code> prints the recipe that it would normally execute but usually does not execute it. </p> <p>With the ‘<samp>-t</samp>’ flag, <code>make</code> ignores the recipes in the rules and uses (in effect) the command <code>touch</code> for each target that needs to be remade. The <code>touch</code> command is also printed, unless ‘<samp>-s</samp>’ or <code>.SILENT</code> is used. For speed, <code>make</code> does not actually invoke the program <code>touch</code>. It does the work directly. </p> <p>With the ‘<samp>-q</samp>’ flag, <code>make</code> prints nothing and executes no recipes, but the exit status code it returns is zero if and only if the targets to be considered are already up to date. If the exit status is one, then some updating needs to be done. If <code>make</code> encounters an error, the exit status is two, so you can distinguish an error from a target that is not up to date. </p> <p>It is an error to use more than one of these three flags in the same invocation of <code>make</code>. </p>  <p>The ‘<samp>-n</samp>’, ‘<samp>-t</samp>’, and ‘<samp>-q</samp>’ options do not affect recipe lines that begin with ‘<samp>+</samp>’ characters or contain the strings ‘<samp>$(MAKE)</samp>’ or ‘<samp>${MAKE}</samp>’. Note that only the line containing the ‘<samp>+</samp>’ character or the strings ‘<samp>$(MAKE)</samp>’ or ‘<samp>${MAKE}</samp>’ is run regardless of these options. Other lines in the same rule are not run unless they too begin with ‘<samp>+</samp>’ or contain ‘<samp>$(MAKE)</samp>’ or ‘<samp>${MAKE}</samp>’ (See <a href="make-variable.html">How the <code>MAKE</code> Variable Works</a>.) </p>  <p>The ‘<samp>-t</samp>’ flag prevents phony targets (see <a href="phony-targets.html">Phony Targets</a>) from being updated, unless there are recipe lines beginning with ‘<samp>+</samp>’ or containing ‘<samp>$(MAKE)</samp>’ or ‘<samp>${MAKE}</samp>’. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>-W</samp>’ flag provides two features: </p> <ul> <li> If you also use the ‘<samp>-n</samp>’ or ‘<samp>-q</samp>’ flag, you can see what <code>make</code> would do if you were to modify some files. </li>
<li> Without the ‘<samp>-n</samp>’ or ‘<samp>-q</samp>’ flag, when <code>make</code> is actually executing recipes, the ‘<samp>-W</samp>’ flag can direct <code>make</code> to act as if some files had been modified, without actually running the recipes for those files. </li>
</ul> <p>Note that the options ‘<samp>-p</samp>’ and ‘<samp>-v</samp>’ allow you to obtain other information about <code>make</code> or about the makefiles in use (see <a href="options-summary.html">Summary of Options</a>). </p><div class="_attribution">
