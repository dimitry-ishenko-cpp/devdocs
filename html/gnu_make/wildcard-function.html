  <h1 class="subsection">The Function wildcard</h1>  <p>Wildcard expansion happens automatically in rules. But wildcard expansion does not normally take place when a variable is set, or inside the arguments of a function. If you want to do wildcard expansion in such places, you need to use the <code>wildcard</code> function, like this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">$(wildcard <var>pattern</var>…)
</pre>
</div> <p>This string, used anywhere in a makefile, is replaced by a space-separated list of names of existing files that match one of the given file name patterns. If no existing file name matches a pattern, then that pattern is omitted from the output of the <code>wildcard</code> function. Note that this is different from how unmatched wildcards behave in rules, where they are used verbatim rather than ignored (see <a href="wildcard-pitfall.html">Wildcard Pitfall</a>). </p> <p>As with wildcard expansion in rules, the results of the <code>wildcard</code> function are sorted. But again, each individual expression is sorted separately, so ‘<samp>$(wildcard *.c *.h)</samp>’ will expand to all files matching ‘<samp>.c</samp>’, sorted, followed by all files matching ‘<samp>.h</samp>’, sorted. </p> <p>One use of the <code>wildcard</code> function is to get a list of all the C source files in a directory, like this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">$(wildcard *.c)
</pre>
</div> <p>We can change the list of C source files into a list of object files by replacing the ‘<samp>.c</samp>’ suffix with ‘<samp>.o</samp>’ in the result, like this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))
</pre>
</div> <p>(Here we have used another function, <code>patsubst</code>. See <a href="text-functions.html">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</a>.) </p> <p>Thus, a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and then link them together could be written as follows: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">objects := $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))

foo : $(objects)
        cc -o foo $(objects)
</pre>
</div> <p>(This takes advantage of the implicit rule for compiling C programs, so there is no need to write explicit rules for compiling the files. See <a href="flavors.html">The Two Flavors of Variables</a>, for an explanation of ‘<samp>:=</samp>’, which is a variant of ‘<samp>=</samp>’.) </p><div class="_attribution">
