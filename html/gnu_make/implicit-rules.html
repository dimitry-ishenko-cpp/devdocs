  <h1 class="chapter">Using Implicit Rules</h1>   <p>Certain standard ways of remaking target files are used very often. For example, one customary way to make an object file is from a C source file using the C compiler, <code>cc</code>. </p> <p><em>Implicit rules</em> tell <code>make</code> how to use customary techniques so that you do not have to specify them in detail when you want to use them. For example, there is an implicit rule for C compilation. File names determine which implicit rules are run. For example, C compilation typically takes a <samp>.c</samp> file and makes a <samp>.o</samp> file. So <code>make</code> applies the implicit rule for C compilation when it sees this combination of file name endings. </p> <p>A chain of implicit rules can apply in sequence; for example, <code>make</code> will remake a <samp>.o</samp> file from a <samp>.y</samp> file by way of a <samp>.c</samp> file. </p> <p>The built-in implicit rules use several variables in their recipes so that, by changing the values of the variables, you can change the way the implicit rule works. For example, the variable <code>CFLAGS</code> controls the flags given to the C compiler by the implicit rule for C compilation. </p> <p>You can define your own implicit rules by writing <em>pattern rules</em>. </p> <p><em>Suffix rules</em> are a more limited way to define implicit rules. Pattern rules are more general and clearer, but suffix rules are retained for compatibility. </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
