  <h1 class="section">Archive Members as Targets</h1>  <p>An individual member of an archive file can be used as a target or prerequisite in <code>make</code>. You specify the member named <var>member</var> in archive file <var>archive</var> as follows: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example"><var>archive</var>(<var>member</var>)
</pre>
</div> <p>This construct is available only in targets and prerequisites, not in recipes! Most programs that you might use in recipes do not support this syntax and cannot act directly on archive members. Only <code>ar</code> and other programs specifically designed to operate on archives can do so. Therefore, valid recipes to update an archive member target probably must use <code>ar</code>. For example, this rule says to create a member <samp>hack.o</samp> in archive <samp>foolib</samp> by copying the file <samp>hack.o</samp>: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">foolib(hack.o) : hack.o
        ar cr foolib hack.o
</pre>
</div> <p>In fact, nearly all archive member targets are updated in just this way and there is an implicit rule to do it for you. <strong>Please note:</strong> The ‘<samp>c</samp>’ flag to <code>ar</code> is required if the archive file does not already exist. </p> <p>To specify several members in the same archive, you can write all the member names together between the parentheses. For example: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">foolib(hack.o kludge.o)
</pre>
</div> <p>is equivalent to: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">foolib(hack.o) foolib(kludge.o)
</pre>
</div>  <p>You can also use shell-style wildcards in an archive member reference. See <a href="wildcards.html">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</a>. For example, ‘<samp>foolib(*.o)</samp>’ expands to all existing members of the <samp>foolib</samp> archive whose names end in ‘<samp>.o</samp>’; perhaps ‘<samp>foolib(hack.o) foolib(kludge.o)</samp>’. </p><div class="_attribution">
