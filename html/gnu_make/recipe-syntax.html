  <h1 class="section">Recipe Syntax</h1>   <p>Makefiles have the unusual property that there are really two distinct syntaxes in one file. Most of the makefile uses <code>make</code> syntax (see <a href="makefiles.html">Writing Makefiles</a>). However, recipes are meant to be interpreted by the shell and so they are written using shell syntax. The <code>make</code> program does not try to understand shell syntax: it performs only a very few specific translations on the content of the recipe before handing it to the shell. </p> <p>Each line in the recipe must start with a tab (or the first character in the value of the <code>.RECIPEPREFIX</code> variable; see <a href="special-variables.html">Special Variables</a>), except that the first recipe line may be attached to the target-and-prerequisites line with a semicolon in between. <em>Any</em> line in the makefile that begins with a tab and appears in a “rule context” (that is, after a rule has been started until another rule or variable definition) will be considered part of a recipe for that rule. Blank lines and lines of just comments may appear among the recipe lines; they are ignored. </p> <p>Some consequences of these rules include: </p> <ul> <li> A blank line that begins with a tab is not blank: it’s an empty recipe (see <a href="empty-recipes.html">Empty Recipes</a>). </li>
<li>    A comment in a recipe is not a <code>make</code> comment; it will be passed to the shell as-is. Whether the shell treats it as a comment or not depends on your shell. </li>
<li> A variable definition in a “rule context” which is indented by a tab as the first character on the line, will be considered part of a recipe, not a <code>make</code> variable definition, and passed to the shell. </li>
<li> A conditional expression (<code>ifdef</code>, <code>ifeq</code>, etc. see <a href="conditional-syntax.html">Syntax of Conditionals</a>) in a “rule context” which is indented by a tab as the first character on the line, will be considered part of a recipe and be passed to the shell. </li>
