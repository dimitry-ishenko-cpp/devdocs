  <h1 class="section">Parallel Execution</h1>       <p>GNU <code>make</code> knows how to execute several recipes at once. Normally, <code>make</code> will execute only one recipe at a time, waiting for it to finish before executing the next. However, the ‘<samp>-j</samp>’ or ‘<samp>--jobs</samp>’ option tells <code>make</code> to execute many recipes simultaneously. You can inhibit parallelism for some or all targets from within the makefile (see <a href="parallel-disable.html">Disabling Parallel Execution</a>). </p> <p>On MS-DOS, the ‘<samp>-j</samp>’ option has no effect, since that system doesn’t support multi-processing. </p> <p>If the ‘<samp>-j</samp>’ option is followed by an integer, this is the number of recipes to execute at once; this is called the number of <em>job slots</em>. If there is nothing looking like an integer after the ‘<samp>-j</samp>’ option, there is no limit on the number of job slots. The default number of job slots is one, which means serial execution (one thing at a time). </p> <p>Handling recursive <code>make</code> invocations raises issues for parallel execution. For more information on this, see <a href="options_002frecursion.html">Communicating Options to a Sub-<code>make</code></a>. </p> <p>If a recipe fails (is killed by a signal or exits with a nonzero status), and errors are not ignored for that recipe (see <a href="errors.html">Errors in Recipes</a>), the remaining recipe lines to remake the same target will not be run. If a recipe fails and the ‘<samp>-k</samp>’ or ‘<samp>--keep-going</samp>’ option was not given (see <a href="options-summary.html">Summary of Options</a>), <code>make</code> aborts execution. If make terminates for any reason (including a signal) with child processes running, it waits for them to finish before actually exiting. </p>       <p>When the system is heavily loaded, you will probably want to run fewer jobs than when it is lightly loaded. You can use the ‘<samp>-l</samp>’ option to tell <code>make</code> to limit the number of jobs to run at once, based on the load average. The ‘<samp>-l</samp>’ or ‘<samp>--max-load</samp>’ option is followed by a floating-point number. For example, </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">-l 2.5
</pre>
</div> <p>will not let <code>make</code> start more than one job if the load average is above 2.5. The ‘<samp>-l</samp>’ option with no following number removes the load limit, if one was given with a previous ‘<samp>-l</samp>’ option. </p> <p>More precisely, when <code>make</code> goes to start up a job, and it already has at least one job running, it checks the current load average; if it is not lower than the limit given with ‘<samp>-l</samp>’, <code>make</code> waits until the load average goes below that limit, or until all the other jobs finish. </p> <p>By default, there is no load limit. </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
