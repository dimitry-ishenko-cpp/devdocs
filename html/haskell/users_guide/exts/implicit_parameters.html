In Haskell, all variables are statically bound. Dynamic binding of variables is a notion that goes back to Lisp, but was later discarded in more modern incarnations, such as Scheme. Dynamic binding can be very confusing in an untyped language, and unfortunately, typed languages, in particular Hindley-Milner typed languages like Haskell, only support static scoping of variables.</p> <p>However, by a simple extension to the type class system of Haskell, we can support dynamic binding. Basically, we express the use of a dynamically bound variable as a constraint on the type. These constraints lead to types of the form <code>(?x::t') =&gt; t</code>, which says “this function uses a dynamically-bound variable <code>?x</code> of type <code>t'</code>”. For example, the following expresses the type of a sort function, implicitly parameterised by a comparison function named <code>cmp</code>.</p> <pre data-language="haskell">sort :: (?cmp :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
</pre> <p>The dynamic binding constraints are just a new form of predicate in the type class system.</p> <p>An implicit parameter occurs in an expression using the special form <code>?x</code>, where <code>x</code> is any valid identifier (e.g. <code>ord ?x</code> is a valid expression). Use of this construct also introduces a new dynamic-binding constraint in the type of the expression. For example, the following definition shows how we can define an implicitly parameterised sort function in terms of an explicitly parameterised <code>sortBy</code> function:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">sortBy :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]

sort   :: (?cmp :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
sort    = sortBy ?cmp
</pre> <section id="implicit-parameter-type-constraints"> <h2>
<span class="section-number">6.11.6.1. </span>Implicit-parameter type constraints</h2> <p>Dynamic binding constraints behave just like other type class constraints in that they are automatically propagated. Thus, when a function is used, its implicit parameters are inherited by the function that called it. For example, our <code>sort</code> function might be used to pick out the least value in a list:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">least   :: (?cmp :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
least xs = head (sort xs)
</pre> <p>Without lifting a finger, the <code>?cmp</code> parameter is propagated to become a parameter of <code>least</code> as well. With explicit parameters, the default is that parameters must always be explicit propagated. With implicit parameters, the default is to always propagate them.</p> <p>An implicit-parameter type constraint differs from other type class constraints in the following way: All uses of a particular implicit parameter must have the same type. This means that the type of <code>(?x, ?x)</code> is <code>(?x::a) =&gt; (a,a)</code>, and not <code>(?x::a, ?x::b) =&gt; (a, b)</code>, as would be the case for type class constraints.</p> <p>You can’t have an implicit parameter in the context of a class or instance declaration. For example, both these declarations are illegal:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">class (?x::Int) =&gt; C a where ...
instance (?x::a) =&gt; Foo [a] where ...
</pre> <p>Reason: exactly which implicit parameter you pick up depends on exactly where you invoke a function. But the “invocation” of instance declarations is done behind the scenes by the compiler, so it’s hard to figure out exactly where it is done. Easiest thing is to outlaw the offending types.</p> <p>Implicit-parameter constraints do not cause ambiguity. For example, consider:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: (?x :: [a]) =&gt; Int -&gt; Int
f n = n + length ?x

g :: (Read a, Show a) =&gt; String -&gt; String
g s = show (read s)
</pre> <p>Here, <code>g</code> has an ambiguous type, and is rejected, but <code>f</code> is fine. The binding for <code>?x</code> at <code>f</code>‘s call site is quite unambiguous, and fixes the type <code>a</code>.</p> </section> <section id="implicit-parameter-bindings"> <h2>
<span class="section-number">6.11.6.2. </span>Implicit-parameter bindings</h2> <p>An implicit parameter is <em>bound</em> using the standard <code>let</code> or <code>where</code> binding forms. For example, we define the <code>min</code> function by binding <code>cmp</code>.</p> <pre data-language="haskell">min :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
min  = let ?cmp = (&lt;=) in least
</pre> <p>A group of implicit-parameter bindings may occur anywhere a normal group of Haskell bindings can occur, except at top level. That is, they can occur in a <code>let</code> (including in a list comprehension, or do-notation, or pattern guards), or a <code>where</code> clause. Note the following points:</p> <ul> <li>An implicit-parameter binding group must be a collection of simple bindings to implicit-style variables (no function-style bindings, and no type signatures); these bindings are neither polymorphic or recursive.</li> <li>You may not mix implicit-parameter bindings with ordinary bindings in a single <code>let</code> expression; use two nested <code>let</code>s instead. (In the case of <code>where</code> you are stuck, since you can’t nest <code>where</code> clauses.)</li> <li>
<p>You may put multiple implicit-parameter bindings in a single binding group; but they are <em>not</em> treated as a mutually recursive group (as ordinary <code>let</code> bindings are). Instead they are treated as a non-recursive group, simultaneously binding all the implicit parameter. The bindings are not nested, and may be re-ordered without changing the meaning of the program. For example, consider:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f t = let { ?x = t; ?y = ?x+(1::Int) } in ?x + ?y
</pre> <p>The use of <code>?x</code> in the binding for <code>?y</code> does not “see” the binding for <code>?x</code>, so the type of <code>f</code> is</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: (?x::Int) =&gt; Int -&gt; Int
</pre> </li> </ul> </section> <section id="implicit-parameters-and-polymorphic-recursion"> <h2>
<span class="section-number">6.11.6.3. </span>Implicit parameters and polymorphic recursion</h2> <p>Consider these two definitions:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">len1 :: [a] -&gt; Int
len1 xs = let ?acc = 0 in len_acc1 xs

len_acc1 [] = ?acc
len_acc1 (x:xs) = let ?acc = ?acc + (1::Int) in len_acc1 xs

------------

len2 :: [a] -&gt; Int
len2 xs = let ?acc = 0 in len_acc2 xs

len_acc2 :: (?acc :: Int) =&gt; [a] -&gt; Int
len_acc2 [] = ?acc
len_acc2 (x:xs) = let ?acc = ?acc + (1::Int) in len_acc2 xs
</pre> <p>The only difference between the two groups is that in the second group <code>len_acc</code> is given a type signature. In the former case, <code>len_acc1</code> is monomorphic in its own right-hand side, so the implicit parameter <code>?acc</code> is not passed to the recursive call. In the latter case, because <code>len_acc2</code> has a type signature, the recursive call is made to the <em>polymorphic</em> version, which takes <code>?acc</code> as an implicit parameter. So we get the following results in GHCi:</p> <pre data-language="none">Prog&gt; len1 "hello"
0
Prog&gt; len2 "hello"
5
</pre> <p>Adding a type signature dramatically changes the result! This is a rather counter-intuitive phenomenon, worth watching out for.</p> </section> <section id="implicit-parameters-scoping-guarantees"> <h2>
<span class="section-number">6.11.6.4. </span>Implicit parameters scoping guarantees</h2> <p>GHC always takes the most nested implicit parameter binding from the context to find the value. Consider the following code:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">let ?f = 1 in let ?f = 2 in ?f
</pre> <p>This expression will always return 2.</p> <p>Another example of this rule is matching over constructors with constraints. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">data T where
  MkT :: (?f :: Int) =&gt; T

f :: T -&gt; T -&gt; Int
f MkT MkT = ?f
</pre> <p>Here GHC will always take <code>?f</code> from the last match.</p> </section> <section id="implicit-parameters-and-monomorphism"> <h2>
<span class="section-number">6.11.6.5. </span>Implicit parameters and monomorphism</h2> <p>GHC applies the dreaded Monomorphism Restriction (section 4.5.5 of the Haskell Report) to implicit parameters. For example, consider:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: Int -&gt; Int
f v = let ?x = 0     in
      let y = ?x + v in
      let ?x = 5     in
      y
</pre> <p>Since the binding for <code>y</code> falls under the Monomorphism Restriction it is not generalised, so the type of <code>y</code> is simply <code>Int</code>, not <code>(?x::Int) =&gt; Int</code>. Hence, <code>(f 9)</code> returns result <code>9</code>. If you add a type signature for <code>y</code>, then <code>y</code> will get type <code>(?x::Int) =&gt; Int</code>, so the occurrence of <code>y</code> in the body of the <code>let</code> will see the inner binding of <code>?x</code>, so <code>(f 9)</code> will return <code>14</code>.</p> </section> </section> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
