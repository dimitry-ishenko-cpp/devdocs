<h1 id="id1">6.2.18. Typed Holes</h1>
<div class="_sphinx"> <div itemprop="articleBody">   <p id="typed-holes">Typed holes are a feature of GHC that allows special placeholders written with a leading underscore (e.g., “<code>_</code>”, “<code>_foo</code>”, “<code>_bar</code>”), to be used as expressions. During compilation these holes will generate an error message that describes which type is expected at the hole’s location, information about the origin of any free type variables, and a list of local bindings that might help fill the hole and bindings in scope that fit the type of the hole that might help fill the hole with actual code. Typed holes are always enabled in GHC.</p> <p>The goal of typed holes is to help with writing Haskell code rather than to change the type system. Typed holes can be used to obtain extra information from the type checker, which might otherwise be hard to get. Normally, using GHCi, users can inspect the (inferred) type signatures of all top-level bindings. However, this method is less convenient with terms that are not defined on top-level or inside complex expressions. Holes allow the user to check the type of the term they are about to write.</p> <p>For example, compiling the following module with GHC:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: a -&gt; a
f x = _
</pre> <p>will fail with the following error:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">hole.hs:2:7:
    Found hole `_' with type: a
    Where: `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
               the type signature for f :: a -&gt; a at hole.hs:1:6
    In the expression: _
    In an equation for `f': f x = _
    Relevant bindings include
      x :: a (bound at hole.hs:2:3)
      f :: a -&gt; a (bound at hole.hs:2:1)
    Valid hole fits include x :: a (bound at hole.hs:2:3)
</pre> <p>Here are some more details:</p> <ul> <li>
<p class="first">A “<code>Found hole</code>” error usually terminates compilation, like any other type error. After all, you have omitted some code from your program. Nevertheless, you can run and test a piece of code containing holes, by using the <a class="reference internal" href="../using-warnings.html#ghc-flag--fdefer-typed-holes"><code>-fdefer-typed-holes</code></a> flag. This flag defers errors produced by typed holes until runtime, and converts them into compile-time warnings. These warnings can in turn be suppressed entirely by <a class="reference internal" href="../using-warnings.html#ghc-flag--Wtyped-holes"><code>-Wno-typed-holes</code></a>.</p> <p>The same behaviour for “<code>Variable out of scope</code>” errors, it terminates compilation by default. You can defer such errors by using the <a class="reference internal" href="../using-warnings.html#ghc-flag--fdefer-out-of-scope-variables"><code>-fdefer-out-of-scope-variables</code></a> flag. This flag defers errors produced by out of scope variables until runtime, and converts them into compile-time warnings. These warnings can in turn be suppressed entirely by <a class="reference internal" href="../using-warnings.html#ghc-flag--Wdeferred-out-of-scope-variables"><code>-Wno-deferred-out-of-scope-variables</code></a>.</p> <p>The result is that a hole or a variable will behave like <code>undefined</code>, but with the added benefits that it shows a warning at compile time, and will show the same message if it gets evaluated at runtime. This behaviour follows that of the <a class="reference internal" href="../using-warnings.html#ghc-flag--fdefer-type-errors"><code>-fdefer-type-errors</code></a> option, which implies <a class="reference internal" href="../using-warnings.html#ghc-flag--fdefer-typed-holes"><code>-fdefer-typed-holes</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../using-warnings.html#ghc-flag--fdefer-out-of-scope-variables"><code>-fdefer-out-of-scope-variables</code></a>.

<p class="first">All unbound identifiers are treated as typed holes, <em>whether or not they start with an underscore</em>. The only difference is in the error message:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">cons z = z : True : _x : y
</pre> <p>yields the errors</p> <pre data-language="none">Foo.hs:3:21: error:

</pre> <p>More information is given for explicit holes (i.e. ones that start with an underscore), than for out-of-scope variables, because the latter are often unintended typos, so the extra information is distracting. If you want the detailed information, use a leading underscore to make explicit your intent to use a hole.</p> </li> <li>

</pre> <p>Notice the two different types reported for the two different occurrences of <code>_x</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p class="first">No language extension is required to use typed holes. The lexeme “<code>_</code>” was previously illegal in Haskell, but now has a more informative error message. The lexeme “<code>_x</code>” is a perfectly legal variable, and its behaviour is unchanged when it is in scope. For example</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f _x = _x + 1
</pre> <p>does not elicit any errors. Only a variable <em>that is not in scope</em> (whether or not it starts with an underscore) is treated as an error (which it always was), albeit now with a more informative error message.</p> </li> <li>Unbound data constructors used in expressions behave exactly as above. However, unbound data constructors used in <em>patterns</em> cannot be deferred, and instead bring compilation to a halt. (In implementation terms, they are reported by the renamer rather than the type checker.) </li> <li>
<p class="first">The list of valid hole fits is found by checking which bindings in scope would fit into the hole. As an example, compiling the following module with GHC:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">import Data.List (inits)

g :: [String]
g = _ "hello, world"
</pre> <p>yields the errors:</p> <pre data-language="none">• Found hole: _ :: [Char] -&gt; [String]

Sorts by checking which hole fits subsume other hole fits, such that if hole fit a could be used as hole fits for hole fit b, then b appears before a in the output. It is more precise than the default sort, but also a lot slower, since a subsumption check has to be run for each pair of valid hole fits.</p> </dd>
