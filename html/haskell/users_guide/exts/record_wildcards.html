</dl> <p>Record wildcards are enabled by the language extension <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-RecordWildCards"><code>RecordWildCards</code></a>. This extension implies <a class="reference internal" href="disambiguate_record_fields.html#extension-DisambiguateRecordFields"><code>DisambiguateRecordFields</code></a>.</p> <p>For records with many fields, it can be tiresome to write out each field individually in a record pattern, as in</p> <pre data-language="haskell">data C = C {a :: Int, b :: Int, c :: Int, d :: Int}
f (C {a = 1, b = b, c = c, d = d}) = b + c + d
</pre> <p>Record wildcard syntax permits a “<code>..</code>” in a record pattern, where each elided field <code>f</code> is replaced by the pattern <code>f = f</code>. For example, the above pattern can be written as</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f (C {a = 1, ..}) = b + c + d
</pre> <p>More details:</p> <ul> <li>
<p class="first">Record wildcards in patterns can be mixed with other patterns, including puns (<a class="reference internal" href="record_puns.html#record-puns"><span class="std std-ref">Record puns</span></a>); for example, in a pattern <code>(C {a = 1, b, ..})</code>. Additionally, record wildcards can be used wherever record patterns occur, including in <code>let</code> bindings and at the top-level. For example, the top-level binding</p> <pre data-language="haskell">C {a = 1, ..} = e
</pre> <p>defines <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, and <code>d</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p class="first">Record wildcards can also be used in an expression, when constructing a record. For example,</p> <pre data-language="haskell">let {a = 1; b = 2; c = 3; d = 4} in C {..}
</pre> <p>in place of</p> <pre data-language="haskell">let {a = 1; b = 2; c = 3; d = 4} in C {a=a, b=b, c=c, d=d}
</pre> <p>The expansion is purely syntactic, so the record wildcard expression refers to the nearest enclosing variables that are spelled the same as the omitted field names.</p> </li> <li>
<p class="first">For both pattern and expression wildcards, the “<code>..</code>” expands to the missing <em>in-scope</em> record fields. Specifically the expansion of “<code>C {..}</code>” includes <code>f</code> if and only if:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>f</code> is a record field of constructor <code>C</code>.</li> <li>The record field <code>f</code> is in scope somehow (either qualified or unqualified).</li> </ul> <p>These rules restrict record wildcards to the situations in which the user could have written the expanded version. For example</p> <pre data-language="haskell">module M where
  data R = R { a,b,c :: Int }
module X where
  import M( R(R,a,c) )
  f a b = R { .. }
</pre> <p>The <code>R{..}</code> expands to <code>R{a=a}</code>, omitting <code>b</code> since the record field is not in scope, and omitting <code>c</code> since the variable <code>c</code> is not in scope (apart from the binding of the record selector <code>c</code>, of course).</p> </li> <li>
<p class="first">When record wildcards are use in record construction, a field <code>f</code> is initialised only if <code>f</code> is in scope, and is not imported or bound at top level. For example, <code>f</code> can be bound by an enclosing pattern match or let/where-binding. For example</p> <pre data-language="haskell">module M where
  import A( a )

  data R = R { a,b,c,d :: Int }

  c = 3 :: Int

  f b = R { .. }  -- Expands to R { b = b, d = d }
    where
      d = b+1
</pre> <p>Here, <code>a</code> is imported, and <code>c</code> is bound at top level, so neither contribute to the expansion of the “<code>..</code>”. The motivation here is that it should be easy for the reader to figure out what the “<code>..</code>” expands to.</p> </li> <li>
<p class="first">Record wildcards cannot be used (a) in a record update construct, and (b) for data constructors that are not declared with record fields. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f x = x { v=True, .. }   -- Illegal (a)

data T = MkT Int Bool
g = MkT { .. }           -- Illegal (b)
h (MkT { .. }) = True    -- Illegal (b)
</pre> </li> </ul>  </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
