<h1 id="id1">6.19.6. HasCallStack</h1>
<div class="_sphinx"> <div itemprop="articleBody"> <section id="hascallstack">  <p><code>GHC.Stack.HasCallStack</code> is a lightweight method of obtaining a partial call-stack at any point in the program.</p> <p>A function can request its call-site with the <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint and access it as a Haskell value by using <code>callStack</code>.</p> <p>One can then use functions from <code>GHC.Stack</code> to inspect or pretty print (as is done in <code>f</code> below) the call stack.</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: HasCallStack =&gt; IO ()
f = putStrLn (prettyCallStack callStack)

g :: HasCallStack =&gt; IO ()
g = f
</pre> <p>Evaluating <code>f</code> directly shows a call stack with a single entry, while evaluating <code>g</code>, which also requests its call-site, shows two entries, one for each computation “annotated” with <code>HasCallStack</code>.</p> <pre data-language="none">ghci&gt; f
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  f, called at &lt;interactive&gt;:19:1 in interactive:Ghci1
ghci&gt; g
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  f, called at &lt;interactive&gt;:17:5 in main:Main
  g, called at &lt;interactive&gt;:20:1 in interactive:Ghci2
</pre> <p>The <code>error</code> function from the Prelude supports printing the call stack that led to the error in addition to the usual error message:</p> <pre data-language="none">ghci&gt; error "bad"
*** Exception: bad
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at &lt;interactive&gt;:25:1 in interactive:Ghci5
</pre> <p>The call stack here consists of a single entry, pinpointing the source of the call to <code>error</code>. However, by annotating several computations with <code>HasCallStack</code>, figuring out the exact circumstances and sequences of calls that lead to a call to <code>error</code> becomes a lot easier, as demonstrated with the simple example below.</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: HasCallStack =&gt; IO ()
f = error "bad bad bad"

g :: HasCallStack =&gt; IO ()
g = f

h :: HasCallStack =&gt; IO ()
h = g
</pre> <pre data-language="none">ghci&gt; h
*** Exception: bad bad bad
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at call-stack.hs:4:5 in main:Main
  f, called at call-stack.hs:7:5 in main:Main
  g, called at call-stack.hs:10:5 in main:Main
  h, called at &lt;interactive&gt;:28:1 in interactive:Ghci1
</pre> <p>The <code>CallStack</code> will only extend as far as the types allow it, for example</p> <pre data-language="haskell">myHead :: HasCallStack =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
myHead []     = error "empty"
myHead (x:xs) = x

bad :: Int
bad = myHead []
</pre> <pre data-language="none">ghci&gt; bad
*** Exception: empty
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at Bad.hs:8:15 in main:Bad
  myHead, called at Bad.hs:12:7 in main:Bad
</pre> <p>includes the call-site of <code>error</code> in <code>myHead</code>, and of <code>myHead</code> in <code>bad</code>, but not the call-site of <code>bad</code> at the GHCi prompt.</p> <p>GHC solves <code>HasCallStack</code> constraints in two steps:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>If there is a <code>CallStack</code> in scope – i.e. the enclosing definition has a <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint – GHC will push the new call-site onto the existing <code>CallStack</code>.</li> <li>Otherwise GHC will solve the <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint for the singleton <code>CallStack</code> containing just the current call-site.</li> </ol> <p>Importantly, GHC will <strong>never</strong> infer a <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint, you must request it explicitly.</p> <p><code>CallStack</code> is kept abstract, but GHC provides a function</p> <pre data-language="haskell">getCallStack :: CallStack -&gt; [(String, SrcLoc)]
</pre> <p>to access the individual call-sites in the stack. The <code>String</code> is the name of the function that was called, and the <code>SrcLoc</code> provides the package, module, and file name, as well as the line and column numbers.</p> <p><code>GHC.Stack</code> additionally exports a function <code>withFrozenCallStack</code> that allows users to freeze the current <code>CallStack</code>, preventing any future push operations from having an effect. This can be used by library authors to prevent <code>CallStack</code>s from exposing unnecessary implementation details. Consider the <code>myHead</code> example above, the <code>error</code> line in the printed stack is not particularly enlightening, so we might choose to suppress it by freezing the <code>CallStack</code> that we pass to <code>error</code>.</p> <pre data-language="haskell">myHead :: HasCallStack =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
myHead []     = withFrozenCallStack (error "empty")
myHead (x:xs) = x
</pre> <pre data-language="none">ghci&gt; myHead []
*** Exception: empty
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  myHead, called at Bad.hs:12:7 in main:Bad
</pre> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The intrepid user may notice that <code>HasCallStack</code> is just an alias for an implicit parameter <code>?callStack :: CallStack</code>. This is an implementation detail and <strong>should not</strong> be considered part of the <code>CallStack</code> API, we may decide to change the implementation in the future.</p> <section id="compared-with-other-sources-of-stack-traces"> <h2>
<span class="section-number">6.19.6.1. </span>Compared with other sources of stack traces</h2> <p><code>HasCallStack</code> does not interact with the RTS and does not require compilation with <code>-prof</code>. On the other hand, as the <code>CallStack</code> is built up explicitly via the <code>HasCallStack</code> constraints, it will generally not contain as much information as the simulated call-stacks maintained by the RTS.</p> </section> </section> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
