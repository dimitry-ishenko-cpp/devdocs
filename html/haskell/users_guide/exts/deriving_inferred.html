<h1 id="deriving-inferred">6.6.2. Inferred context for deriving clauses</h1>
<div class="_sphinx"> <div itemprop="articleBody"> <section id="inferred-context-for-deriving-clauses">  <p>The Haskell Report is vague about exactly when a <code>deriving</code> clause is legal. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">data T0 f a = MkT0 a         deriving( Eq )
data T1 f a = MkT1 (f a)     deriving( Eq )
data T2 f a = MkT2 (f (f a)) deriving( Eq )
</pre> <p>The natural generated <code>Eq</code> code would result in these instance declarations:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">instance Eq a         =&gt; Eq (T0 f a) where ...
instance Eq (f a)     =&gt; Eq (T1 f a) where ...
instance Eq (f (f a)) =&gt; Eq (T2 f a) where ...
</pre> <p>The first of these is obviously fine. The second is still fine, although less obviously. The third is not Haskell 98, and risks losing termination of instances.</p> <p>GHC takes a conservative position: it accepts the first two, but not the third. The rule is this: each constraint in the inferred instance context must consist only of type variables, with no repetitions.</p> <p>This rule is applied regardless of flags. If you want a more exotic context, you can write it yourself, using the <a class="reference external" href="#stand-alone-deriving">standalone deriving mechanism</a>.</p> </section> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
