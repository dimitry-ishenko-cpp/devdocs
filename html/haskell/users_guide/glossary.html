<p>GHC will occassionally ship features advertised as being in a <em>technology preview</em> state. Such features are generally opt-in in nature (e.g. new language extensions) and may have various shortcomings. These may include known bugs (which we will try to document), lacking optimisation, and unhandled interactions with other language features. As such, behavior of such features may change in the future. However, we do expect features to converge to non-preview state over the course of a few GHC major releases.</p> </dd> </dl> </section> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
