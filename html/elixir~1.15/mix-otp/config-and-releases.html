<div class="getting-started-title"> <small>Mix and OTP</small> <h1>Configuration and releases</h1> </div>  <blockquote> <p>This chapter is part of the <i>Mix and OTP guide</i> and it depends on previous chapters in this guide. For more information, <a href="introduction-to-mix.html">read the introduction guide</a> or check out the chapter index in the sidebar.</p> </blockquote> <p>In this last chapter, we will make the routing table for our distributed key-value store configurable, and then finally package the software for production.</p> <p>Let’s do this.</p> <h2 id="application-environment">Application environment</h2> <p>So far we have hardcoded the routing table into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Router</code> module. However, we would like to make the table dynamic. This allows us not only to configure development/test/production, but also to allow different nodes to run with different entries in the routing table. There is a feature of <abbr title="Open Telecom Platform">OTP</abbr> that does exactly that: the application environment.</p> <p>Each application has an environment that stores the application’s specific configuration by key. For example, we could store the routing table in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> application environment, giving it a default value and allowing other applications to change the table as needed.</p> <p>Open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/kv/mix.exs</code> and change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">application/0</code> function to return the following:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">def application do
  [
    extra_applications: [:logger],
    env: [routing_table: []],
    mod: {KV, []}
  ]
end
</pre></div> <p>We have added a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:env</code> key to the application. It returns the application default environment, which has an entry of key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:routing_table</code> and value of an empty list. It makes sense for the application environment to ship with an empty table, as the specific routing table depends on the testing/deployment structure.</p> <p>In order to use the application environment in our code, we need to replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Router.table/0</code> with the definition below:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">@doc """
The routing table.
"""
def table do
  Application.fetch_env!(:kv, :routing_table)
end
</pre></div> <p>We use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Application.fetch_env!/2</code> to read the entry for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:routing_table</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv</code>’s environment. You can find more information and other functions to manipulate the app environment in the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html">Application module</a>.</p> <p>Since our routing table is now empty, our distributed tests should fail. Restart the apps and re-run tests to see the failure:</p> <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ iex --sname bar -S mix
$ elixir --sname foo -S mix test --only distributed
</pre></div> <p>We need a way to configure the application environment. That’s when we use configuration files.</p> <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2> <p>Configuration files provide a mechanism for us to configure the environment of any application. Elixir provides two configuration entry points:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/config.exs</code> - this file is read at build time, before we compile our application and before we even load our dependencies. This means we can’t access the code in our application nor in our dependencies. However, it means we can control how they are compiled</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/runtime.exs</code> - this file is read after our application and dependencies are compiled and therefore it can configure how our application works at runtime. If you want to read system environment variables (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System.get_env/1</code>) or any sort of external configuration, this is the appropriate place to do so</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, we can configure IEx default prompt to another value. Let’s create the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/runtime.exs</code> file with the following content:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">import Config
config :iex, default_prompt: "&gt;&gt;&gt;"
</pre></div> <p>Start IEx with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iex -S mix</code> and you can see that the IEx prompt has changed.</p> <p>This means we can also configure our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:routing_table</code> directly in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/runtime.exs</code> file. However, which configuration value should we use?</p> <p>Currently we have two tests tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@tag :distributed</code>. The “server interaction” test in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KVServerTest</code>, and the “route requests across nodes” in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.RouterTest</code>. Both tests are failing since they require a routing table, which is currently empty.</p> <p>For simplicity, we will define a routing table that always points to the current node. That’s the table we will use for development and most of our tests. Back in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/runtime.exs</code>, add this line:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">config :kv, :routing_table, [{?a..?z, node()}]
</pre></div> <p>With such a simple table available, we can now remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@tag :distributed</code> from the test in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test/kv_server_test.exs</code>. If you run the complete suite, the test should now pass.</p> <p>However, for the tests in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.RouterTest</code>, we effectively need two nodes in our routing table. To do so, we will write a setup block that runs before all tests in that file. The setup block will change the application environment and revert it back once we are done, like this:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">defmodule KV.RouterTest do
  use ExUnit.Case

  setup_all do
    current = Application.get_env(:kv, :routing_table)

    Application.put_env(:kv, :routing_table, [
      {?a..?m, :"foo@computer-name"},
      {?n..?z, :"bar@computer-name"}
    ])

    on_exit fn -&gt; Application.put_env(:kv, :routing_table, current) end
  end

  @tag :distributed
  test "route requests across nodes" do
</pre></div> <p>Note we removed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async: true</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use ExUnit.Case</code>. Since the application environment is a global storage, tests that modify it cannot run concurrently. With all changes in place, all tests should pass, including the distributed one.</p> <p>Details of other configuration strategies are beyond the scope of this document, but you should be aware that other sources of runtime configuration data can be specified as configuration providers in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code>. For more details see the documentation for the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/Config.Provider.html#content">Config.Provider module</a>. Excellent libraries for many types of config providers can be found on <a href="https://hex.pm">Hex</a>. These can ease the use of environment variables and configuration files of various formats, such as TOML, YAML, INI, and JSON.</p> <h2 id="releases">Releases</h2> <p>Now that our application runs distributed, you may be wondering how we can package our application to run in production. After all, all of our code so far depends on Erlang and Elixir versions that are installed in your current system. To achieve this goal, Elixir provides releases.</p> <p>A release is a self-contained directory that consists of your application code, all of its dependencies, plus the whole Erlang Virtual Machine (VM) and runtime. Once a release is assembled, it can be packaged and deployed to a target as long as the target runs on the same operating system (OS) distribution and version as the machine that assembled the release.</p> <p>In a regular project, we can assemble a release by simply running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix release</code>. However, we have an umbrella project, and in such cases Elixir requires some extra input from us. Let’s see what is necessary:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ MIX_ENV=prod mix release
** (Mix) Umbrella projects require releases to be explicitly defined with a non-empty applications key that chooses which umbrella children should be part of the releases:

releases: [
  foo: [
    applications: [child_app_foo: :permanent]
  ],
  bar: [
    applications: [child_app_bar: :permanent]
  ]
]

Alternatively you can perform the release from the children applications
</pre></div> <p>That’s because an umbrella project gives us plenty of options when deploying the software. We can:</p> <ul> <li> <p>deploy all applications in the umbrella to a node that will work as both TCP server and key-value storage</p> </li> <li> <p>deploy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv_server</code> application to work only as a TCP server as long as the routing table points only to other nodes</p> </li> <li> <p>deploy only the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> application when we want a node to work only as storage (no TCP access)</p> </li> </ul> <p>As a starting point, let’s define a release that includes both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv_server</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> applications. We will also add a version to it. Open up the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code> in the umbrella root and add inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">def project</code>:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">releases: [
  foo: [
    version: "0.0.1",
    applications: [kv_server: :permanent, kv: :permanent]
  ]
]
</pre></div> <p>That defines a release named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> with both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv_server</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code> applications. Their mode is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:permanent</code>, which means that, if those applications crash, the whole node terminates. That’s reasonable since those applications are essential to our system.</p> <p>Before we assemble the release, let’s also define our routing table for production. Given we expect to have two nodes, we need to update <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/runtime.exs</code> to look like this:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">import Config
    
config :kv, :routing_table, [{?a..?z, node()}]

if config_env() == :prod do
  config :kv, :routing_table, [
    {?a..?m, :"foo@computer-name"},
    {?n..?z, :"bar@computer-name"}
  ]
end
</pre></div> <p>We have hardcoded the table and node names, which is good enough for our example, but you would likely move it to an external configuration system in an actual production setup. We have also wrapped it in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config_env() == :prod</code> check, so this configuration does not apply to other environments.</p> <p>With the configuration in place, let’s give assembling the release another try:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ MIX_ENV=prod mix release foo
* assembling foo-0.0.1 on MIX_ENV=prod
* skipping runtime configuration (config/runtime.exs not found)

Release created at _build/prod/rel/foo

    # To start your system
    _build/prod/rel/foo/bin/foo start

Once the release is running:

    # To connect to it remotely
    _build/prod/rel/foo/bin/foo remote

    # To stop it gracefully (you may also send SIGINT/SIGTERM)
    _build/prod/rel/foo/bin/foo stop

To list all commands:

    _build/prod/rel/foo/bin/foo
</pre></div> <p>Excellent! A release was assembled in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_build/prod/rel/foo</code>. Inside the release, there will be a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo</code> file which is the entry point to your system. It supports multiple commands, such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo start</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo start_iex</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo restart</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo stop</code> - for general management of the release</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo rpc COMMAND</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo remote</code> - for running commands on the running system or to connect to the running system</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo eval COMMAND</code> - to start a fresh system that runs a single command and then shuts down</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo daemon</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo daemon_iex</code> - to start the system as a daemon on Unix-like systems</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo install</code> - to install the system as a service on Windows machines</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/foo start</code>, it will start the system using a short name (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--sname</code>) equal to the release name, which in this case is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code>. The next step is to start a system named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code>, so we can connect <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code> together, like we did in the previous chapter. But before we achieve this, let’s talk a bit about the benefits of releases.</p> <h2 id="why-releases">Why releases?</h2> <p>Releases allow developers to precompile and package all of their code and the runtime into a single unit. The benefits of releases are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Code preloading. The VM has two mechanisms for loading code: interactive and embedded. By default, it runs in the interactive mode which dynamically loads modules when they are used for the first time. The first time your application calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enum.map/2</code>, the VM will find the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enum</code> module and load it. There’s a downside. When you start a new server in production, it may need to load many other modules, causing the first requests to have an unusual spike in response time. Releases run in embedded mode, which loads all available modules upfront, guaranteeing your system is ready to handle requests after booting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configuration and customization. Releases give developers fine grained control over system configuration and the VM flags used to start the system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-contained. A release does not require the source code to be included in your production artifacts. All of the code is precompiled and packaged. Releases do not even require Erlang or Elixir on your servers, as they include the Erlang VM and its runtime by default. Furthermore, both Erlang and Elixir standard libraries are stripped to bring only the parts you are actually using.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multiple releases. You can assemble different releases with different configuration per application or even with different applications altogether.</p> </li> </ul> <p>We have written extensive documentation on releases, so <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html">please check the official docs for more information</a>. For now, we will continue exploring some of the features outlined above.</p> <h2 id="assembling-multiple-releases">Assembling multiple releases</h2> <p>So far, we have assembled a release named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code>, but our routing table contains information for both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code>. Let’s start <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ _build/prod/rel/foo/bin/foo start
16:58:58.508 [info]  Accepting connections on port 4040
</pre></div> <p>And let’s connect to it and issue a request in another terminal:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ telnet 127.0.0.1 4040
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
CREATE bitsandpieces
OK
PUT bitsandpieces sword 1
OK
GET bitsandpieces sword
1
OK
GET shopping foo
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre></div> <p>Our application works already when we operate on the bucket named “bitsandpieces”. But since the “shopping” bucket would be stored on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code>, the request fails as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code> is not available. If you go back to the terminal running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code>, you will see:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">17:16:19.555 [error] Task #PID&lt;0.622.0&gt; started from #PID&lt;0.620.0&gt; terminating

    Args: []
</pre></div> <p>Let’s now define a release for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:bar</code>. One first step could be to define a release exactly like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code>. Additionally we will set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cookie</code> option on both releases to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weknoweachother</code> in order for them to allow connections from each other. See the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html">Distributed Erlang Documentation</a> for further information on this topic:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">releases: [
  foo: [
    version: "0.0.1",
    applications: [kv_server: :permanent, kv: :permanent],
    cookie: "weknoweachother"
  ],
  bar: [
    version: "0.0.1",
    applications: [kv_server: :permanent, kv: :permanent],
    cookie: "weknoweachother"
  ]
]
</pre></div> <p>And now let’s assemble both releases:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ MIX_ENV=prod mix release foo
$ MIX_ENV=prod mix release bar
</pre></div> <p>Stop <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> if it’s still running and re-start it to load the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cookie</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ _build/prod/rel/foo/bin/foo start
</pre></div> <p>And start <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code> in another terminal:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ _build/prod/rel/bar/bin/bar start
</pre></div> <p>You should see an error like the error below happen 5 times, before the application finally shuts down:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">17:21:57.567 [error] Task #PID&lt;0.620.0&gt; started from KVServer.Supervisor terminating
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {:error, :eaddrinuse}

    (stdlib) proc_lib.erl:249: :proc_lib.init_p_do_apply/3
Function: #Function&lt;0.98032413/0 in KVServer.Application.start/2&gt;
    Args: []
</pre></div> <p>That’s happening because the release <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> is already listening on port <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4040</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code> is trying to do the same! One option could be to move the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:port</code> configuration to the application environment, like we did for the routing table, and setup different ports per node.</p> <p>But let’s try something else. Let’s make it so the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code> release contains only the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> application. So it works as a storage but it won’t have a front-end. Change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:bar</code> information to this:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">releases: [
  foo: [
    version: "0.0.1",
    applications: [kv_server: :permanent, kv: :permanent],
    cookie: "weknoweachother"
  ],
  bar: [
    version: "0.0.1",
    applications: [kv: :permanent],
    cookie: "weknoweachother"
  ]
]
</pre></div> <p>And now let’s assemble <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bar</code> once more:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ MIX_ENV=prod mix release bar
</pre></div> <p>And finally successfully boot it:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ _build/prod/rel/bar/bin/bar start
</pre></div> <p>If you connect to localhost once again and perform another request, now everything should work, as long as the routing table contains the correct node names. Outstanding!</p> <p>With releases, we were able to “cut different slices” of our project and prepared them to run in production, all packaged into a single directory.</p> <h2 id="configuring-releases">Configuring releases</h2> <p>Releases also provide built-in hooks for configuring almost every need of the production system:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/config.exs</code> - provides build-time application configuration, which is executed before our application compiles. This file often imports configuration files based on the environment, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/dev.exs</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/prod.exs</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/runtime.exs</code> - provides runtime application configuration. It is executed every time the release boots and is further extensible via config providers</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel/env.sh.eex</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel/env.bat.eex</code> - template files that are copied into every release and executed on every command to set up environment variables, including ones specific to the VM, and the general environment</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel/vm.args.eex</code> - a template file that is copied into every release and provides static configuration of the Erlang Virtual Machine and other runtime flags</p> </li> </ul> <p>As we have seen, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/config.exs</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/runtime.exs</code> are loaded during releases and regular Mix commands. On the other hand, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel/env.sh.eex</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel/vm.args.eex</code> are specific to releases. Let’s take a look.</p> <h3 id="operating-system-environment-configuration">Operating System environment configuration</h3> <p>Every release contains an environment file, named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">env.sh</code> on Unix-like systems and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">env.bat</code> on Windows machines, that executes before the Elixir system starts. In this file, you can execute any OS-level code, such as invoke other applications, set environment variables and so on. Some of those environment variables can even configure how the release itself runs.</p> <p>For instance, releases run using short-names (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--sname</code>). However, if you want to actually run a distributed key-value store in production, you will need multiple nodes and start the release with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--name</code> option. We can achieve this by setting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION</code> environment variable inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">env.sh</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">env.bat</code> files. Mix already has a template for said files which we can customize, so let’s ask Mix to copy them to our application:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ mix release.init
* creating rel/vm.args.eex
* creating rel/remote.vm.args.eex
* creating rel/env.sh.eex
* creating rel/env.bat.eex
</pre></div> <p>If you open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel/env.sh.eex</code>, you will see:</p> <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">#!/bin/sh

# # Sets and enables heart (recommended only in daemon mode)
# case $RELEASE_COMMAND in
#   daemon*)
#     HEART_COMMAND="$RELEASE_ROOT/bin/$RELEASE_NAME $RELEASE_COMMAND"
#     export HEART_COMMAND
#     export ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS="-heart"
#     ;;
#   *)
#     ;;
# esac

# # Set the release to load code on demand (interactive) instead of preloading (embedded).
# export RELEASE_MODE=interactive

# # Set the release to work across nodes.
# # RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION must be "sname" (local), "name" (distributed) or "none".
# export RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=name
# export RELEASE_NODE=&lt;%= @release.name %&gt;
</pre></div> <p>The steps necessary to work across nodes is already commented out as an example. You can enable full distribution by uncommenting the last two lines by removing the leading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"># </code>.</p> <p>If you are on Windows, you will have to open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel/env.bat.eex</code>, where you will find this:</p> <div class="language-bat highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">@echo off
rem Set the release to load code on demand (interactive) instead of preloading (embedded).
rem set RELEASE_MODE=interactive

rem Set the release to work across nodes.
rem RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION must be "sname" (local), "name" (distributed) or "none".
rem set RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=name
rem set RELEASE_NODE=&lt;%= @release.name %&gt;
</pre></div> <p>Once again, uncomment the last two lines by removing the leading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rem </code> to enable full distribution. And that’s all!</p> <h3 id="vm-args">VM args</h3> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel/vm.args.eex</code> allows you to specify low-level flags that control how the Erlang VM and its runtime operate. You specify entries as if you were specifying arguments in the command line with code comments also supported. Here is the default generated file:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">## Customize flags given to the VM: https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html
## -mode/-name/-sname/-setcookie are configured via env vars, do not set them here

</pre></div> <p>You can see <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">a complete list of VM args and flags in the Erlang documentation</a>.</p> <h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2> <p>Throughout the guide, we have built a very simple distributed key-value store as an opportunity to explore many constructs like generic servers, supervisors, tasks, agents, applications and more. Not only that, we have written tests for the whole application, got familiar with ExUnit, and learned how to use the Mix build tool to accomplish a wide range of tasks.</p> <p>If you are looking for a distributed key-value store to use in production, you should definitely look into <a href="http://basho.com/products/riak-kv/">Riak</a>, which also runs in the Erlang <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>. In Riak, the buckets are replicated, to avoid data loss, and instead of a router, they use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing">consistent hashing</a> to map a bucket to a node. A consistent hashing algorithm helps reduce the amount of data that needs to be migrated when new storage nodes are added to your live system.</p> <p>Of course, Elixir can be used for much more than distributed key-value stores. Embedded systems, data-processing and data-ingestion, web applications, audio/video streaming systems, and others are many of the different domains Elixir excels at. We hope this guide has prepared you to explore any of those domains or any future domain you may desire to bring Elixir into.</p> <p>Happy coding!</p><div class="_attribution">
