<h1>   <span>Library Guidelines</span> </h1> <p>This document outlines general guidelines, anti-patterns, and rules for those writing and publishing Elixir libraries meant to be consumed by other developers.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started" class="section-heading"> <a href="#getting-started">  Getting started </a> </h2> <p>You can create a new Elixir library by running the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.15/Mix.Tasks.New.html"><code class="inline">mix new</code></a> command:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">$ mix new my_library
</pre>
<p>The project name is given in the <code class="inline">snake_case</code> convention where all letters are lowercase and words are separate with underscores. This is the same convention used by variables, function names and atoms in Elixir. See the <a href="naming-conventions.html">Naming Conventions</a> document for more information.</p>
<p>Every project has a <code class="inline">mix.exs</code> file, with instructions on how to build, compile, run tests, and so on. Libraries commonly have a <code class="inline">lib</code> directory, which includes Elixir source code, and a <code class="inline">test</code> directory. A <code class="inline">src</code> directory may also exist for Erlang sources.</p>
<p>For more information on running your project, see the official <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html">Mix &amp; OTP guide</a> or <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html">Mix documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="applications-with-supervision-tree" class="section-heading"> <a href="#applications-with-supervision-tree">  Applications with supervision tree </a> </h3> <p>The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.15/Mix.Tasks.New.html"><code class="inline">mix new</code></a> command also allows the <code class="inline">--sup</code> option to scaffold an application with a supervision tree out of the box. We talk about supervision trees later on when discussing one of the common anti-patterns when writing libraries.</p>
<h2 id="publishing" class="section-heading"> <a href="#publishing">  Publishing </a> </h2> <p>Writing code is only the first of many steps to publish a package. We strongly recommend developers to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose a versioning schema. Elixir requires versions to be in the format <code class="inline">MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> but the meaning of those numbers is up to you. Most projects choose <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">license</a>. The most common licenses in the Elixir community are the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT License</a> and the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/">Apache License 2.0</a>. The latter is also the one used by Elixir itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Format.html">code formatter</a>. The code formatter formats your code according to a consistent style shared by your library and the whole community, making it easier for other developers to understand your code and contribute.</p></li>
<li><p>Write tests. Elixir ships with a test-framework named <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.html">ExUnit</a>. The project generated by <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.15/Mix.Tasks.New.html"><code class="inline">mix new</code></a> includes sample tests and doctests.</p></li>
<li><p>Write documentation. The Elixir community is proud of treating documentation as a first-class citizen and making documentation easily accessible. Libraries contribute to the status quo by providing complete API documentation with examples for their modules, types and functions. See the <a href="writing-documentation.html">Writing Documentation</a> guide for more information. Projects like <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc">ExDoc</a> can be used to generate HTML and EPUB documents from the documentation. ExDoc also supports "extra pages", like this one that you are reading. Such pages augment the documentation with tutorials, guides and references.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Projects are often made available to other developers <a href="https://hex.pm/docs/publish">by publishing a Hex package</a>. Hex also <a href="https://hex.pm/pricing">supports private packages for organizations</a>. If ExDoc is configured for the Mix project, publishing a package on Hex will also automatically publish the generated documentation to <a href="https://hexdocs.pm">HexDocs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-handling" class="section-heading"> <a href="#dependency-handling">  Dependency handling </a> </h2> <p>When your library is published and used as a dependency, its <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Project.html#module-configuration">lockfile</a> (usually named <code class="inline">mix.lock</code>) is <em>ignored by the host project</em>. Running <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.15/Mix.Tasks.Deps.Get.html"><code class="inline">mix deps.get</code></a> in the host project attempts to get the latest possible versions of your library’s dependencies, as specified by the requirements in the <code class="inline">deps</code> section of your <code class="inline">mix.exs</code>. These versions might be greater than those stored in your <code class="inline">mix.lock</code> (and hence used in your tests / CI).</p>
<p>On the other hand, contributors of your library, need a deterministic build, which implies the presence of <code class="inline">mix.lock</code> in your Version Control System (VCS).</p>
<p>The best practice of handling <code class="inline">mix.lock</code> file therefore would be to keep it in VCS, and run two different Continuous Integration (CI) workflows: the usual deterministic one, and another one, that starts with <code class="inline">mix deps.unlock --all</code> and always compiles your library and runs tests against latest versions of dependencies. The latter one might be even run nightly or otherwise recurrently to stay notified about any possible issue in regard to dependencies updates.</p>
<h2 id="anti-patterns" class="section-heading"> <a href="#anti-patterns">  Anti-patterns </a> </h2> <p>In this section we document common anti-patterns to avoid when writing libraries.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-using-exceptions-for-control-flow" class="section-heading"> <a href="#avoid-using-exceptions-for-control-flow">  Avoid using exceptions for control-flow </a> </h3> <p>You should avoid using exceptions for control-flow. For example, instead of:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">try do
  contents = File.read!("some_path_that_may_or_may_not_exist")
  {:it_worked, contents}
rescue
  File.Error -&gt;
    :it_failed
end</pre>
<p>you should prefer:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">case File.read("some_path_that_may_or_may_not_exist") do
  {:ok, contents} -&gt; {:it_worked, contents}
  {:error, _} -&gt; :it_failed
end</pre>
<p>As a library author, it is your responsibility to make sure users are not required to use exceptions for control-flow in their applications. You can follow the same convention as Elixir here, using the name without <code class="inline">!</code> for returning <code class="inline">:ok</code>/<code class="inline">:error</code> tuples and appending <code class="inline">!</code> for a version of the function which raises an exception.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a name without <code class="inline">!</code> does not mean a function will never raise. For example, even <a href="file.html#read/1"><code class="inline">File.read/1</code></a> can fail in case of bad arguments:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">iex&gt; File.read(1)
** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in IO.chardata_to_string/1</pre>
<p>The usage of <code class="inline">:ok</code>/<code class="inline">:error</code> tuples is about the domain that the function works on, in this case, file system access. Bad arguments, logical errors, invalid options should raise regardless of the function name. If in doubt, prefer to return tuples instead of raising, as users of your library can always match on the results and raise if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-working-with-invalid-data" class="section-heading"> <a href="#avoid-working-with-invalid-data">  Avoid working with invalid data </a> </h3> <p>Elixir programs should prefer to validate data as close to the end user as possible, so the errors are easy to locate and fix. This practice also saves you from writing defensive code in the internals of the library.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you have an API that receives a filename as a binary. At some point you will want to write to this file. You could have a function like this:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">def my_fun(some_arg, file_to_write_to, options \\ []) do
  ...some code...
  AnotherModuleInLib.invoke_something_that_will_eventually_write_to_file(file_to_write_to)
  ...more code...
end</pre>
<p>The problem with the code above is that, if the user supplies an invalid input, the error will be raised deep inside the library, which makes it confusing for users. Furthermore, when you don't validate the values at the boundary, the internals of your library are never quite sure which kind of values they are working with.</p>
<p>A better function definition would be:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">def my_fun(some_arg, file_to_write_to, options \\ []) when is_binary(file_to_write_to) do</pre>
<p>Elixir also leverages pattern matching and guards in function clauses to provide clear error messages in case invalid arguments are given.</p>
<p>This advice does not only apply to libraries, but to any Elixir code. Every time you receive multiple options or work with external data, you should validate the data at the boundary and convert it to structured data. For example, if you provide a <a href="genserver.html"><code class="inline">GenServer</code></a> that can be started with multiple options, you want to validate those options when the server starts and rely only on structured data throughout the process life cycle. Similarly, if a database or a socket gives you a map of strings, after you receive the data, you should validate it and potentially convert it to a struct or a map of atoms.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-application-configuration" class="section-heading"> <a href="#avoid-application-configuration">  Avoid application configuration </a> </h3> <p>You should avoid using the application environment (see <a href="application.html#get_env/2"><code class="inline">Application.get_env/2</code></a>) as the configuration mechanism for libraries. The application environment is <strong>global</strong> which means it becomes impossible for two dependencies to use your library in two different ways.</p>
<p>Let's see a simple example. Imagine that you implement a library that breaks a string in two parts based on the first occurrence of the dash <code class="inline">-</code> character:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">defmodule DashSplitter do
  def split(string) when is_binary(string) do
    String.split(string, "-", parts: 2)
  end
end</pre>
<p>Now imagine someone wants to split the string in three parts. You decide to make the number of parts configurable via the application environment:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">def split(string) when is_binary(string) do
  parts = Application.get_env(:dash_splitter, :parts, 2)
  String.split(string, "-", parts: parts)
end</pre>
<p>Now users can configure your library in their <code class="inline">config/config.exs</code> file as follows:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">config :dash_splitter, :parts, 3</pre>
<p>Once your library is configured, it will change the behaviour of all users of your library. If a library was expecting it to split the string in 2 parts, since the configuration is global, it will now split it in 3 parts.</p>
<p>The solution is to provide configuration as close as possible to where it is used and not via the application environment. In case of a function, you could expect keyword lists as a new argument:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">def split(string, opts \\ []) when is_binary(string) and is_list(opts) do
  parts = Keyword.get(opts, :parts, 2)
  String.split(string, "-", parts: parts)
end</pre>
<p>In case you need to configure a process, the options should be passed when starting that process.</p>
<p>The application environment should be reserved only for configurations that are truly global, for example, to control your application boot process and its supervision tree. And, generally speaking, it is best to avoid global configuration. If you must use configuration, then prefer runtime configuration instead of compile-time configuration. See the <a href="application.html"><code class="inline">Application</code></a> module for more information.</p>
<p>For all remaining scenarios, libraries should not force their users to use the application environment for configuration. If the user of a library believes that certain parameter should be configured globally, then they can wrap the library functionality with their own application environment configuration.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-defining-modules-that-are-not-in-your-namespace" class="section-heading"> <a href="#avoid-defining-modules-that-are-not-in-your-namespace">  Avoid defining modules that are not in your "namespace" </a> </h3> <p>Even though Elixir does not formally have the concept of namespaces, a library should use its name as a "prefix" for all of its modules (except for special cases like mix tasks). For example, if the library's OTP application name is <code class="inline">:my_lib</code>, then all of its modules should start with the <code class="inline">MyLib</code> prefix, for example <code class="inline">MyLib.User</code>, <code class="inline">MyLib.SubModule</code>, and <code class="inline">MyLib.Application</code>.</p>
<p>This is important because the Erlang VM can only load one instance of a module at a time. So if there are multiple libraries that define the same module, then they are incompatible with each other due to this limitation. By always using the library name as a prefix, it avoids module name clashes due to the unique prefix.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when writing a library that is an extension of another library, you should avoid defining modules inside the parent's library namespace. For example, if you are writing a package that adds authentication to <a href="https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug"><code class="inline">Plug</code></a> called <code class="inline">plug_auth</code>, its modules should be namespaced under <code class="inline">PlugAuth</code> instead of <code class="inline">Plug.Auth</code>, so it avoids conflicts with <code class="inline">Plug</code> if it were to ever define its own authentication functionality.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-use-when-an-import-is-enough" class="section-heading"> <a href="#avoid-use-when-an-import-is-enough">  Avoid <code class="inline">use</code> when an <code class="inline">import</code> is enough </a> </h3> <p>A library should not provide <code class="inline">use MyLib</code> functionality if all <code class="inline">use MyLib</code> does is to <code class="inline">import</code>/<code class="inline">alias</code> the module itself. For example, this is an anti-pattern:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">defmodule MyLib do
  defmacro __using__(_) do
    quote do
      import MyLib
    end
  end

  def some_fun(arg1, arg2) do
    ...
  end
end</pre>
<p>The reason why defining the <code class="inline">__using__</code> macro above should be avoided is because when a developer writes:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">defmodule MyApp do
  use MyLib
end</pre>
<p>It allows <code class="inline">use MyLib</code> to run <em>any</em> code into the <code class="inline">MyApp</code> module. For someone reading the code, it is impossible to assess the impact that <code class="inline">use MyLib</code> has in a module without looking at the implementation of <code class="inline">__using__</code>.</p>
<p>The following code is clearer:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">defmodule MyApp do
  import MyLib
end</pre>
<p>The code above says we are only bringing in the functions from <code class="inline">MyLib</code> so we can invoke <code class="inline">some_fun(arg1, arg2)</code> directly without the <code class="inline">MyLib.</code> prefix. Even more important, <code class="inline">import MyLib</code> says that we have an option to not <code class="inline">import MyLib</code> at all as we can simply invoke the function as <code class="inline">MyLib.some_fun(arg1, arg2)</code>.</p>
<p>If the module you want to invoke a function on has a long name, such as <code class="inline">SomeLibrary.Namespace.MyLib</code>, and you find it verbose, you can leverage the <a href="kernel.specialforms.html#alias/2"><code class="inline">alias/2</code></a> special form and still refer to the module as <code class="inline">MyLib</code>.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-undocumented-use-somemodule" class="section-heading"> <a href="#avoid-undocumented-use-somemodule">  Avoid undocumented <code class="inline">use SomeModule</code> </a> </h3> <p>In some situations, where you need to do more than importing and aliasing modules, allowing a developer to <code class="inline">use SomeModule</code> may be necessary. The benefit of <code class="inline">use SomeModule</code> is that it provides a common extension point for the Elixir ecosystem. However, given <code class="inline">use SomeModule</code> can execute any code, it may not be easy for developers to understand the impact of <code class="inline">use SomeModule</code>.</p>
<p>For this reason, to provide guidance and clarity, we recommend library authors to include an admonition block in their <code class="inline">@moduledoc</code> that explains how <code class="inline">use SomeModule</code> impacts the developer's code. As an example, the <a href="genserver.html"><code class="inline">GenServer</code></a> documentation outlines:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 class="info"><code class="inline">use GenServer</code></h4>
<p>When you <code class="inline">use GenServer</code>, the <a href="genserver.html"><code class="inline">GenServer</code></a> module will set <code class="inline">@behaviour GenServer</code> and define a <code class="inline">child_spec/1</code> function, so your module can be used as a child in a supervision tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think of this summary as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition_facts_label">"Nutrition facts"</a> for code generation. Keep in mind to only list changes made to the public API of the module. For example, if <code class="inline">use SomeModule</code> sets an internal attribute called <code class="inline">@_some_module_info</code> and this attribute is never meant to be public, it must not be listed.</p>
<p>For convenience, the markup notation to generate the admonition block above is:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">&gt; #### `use GenServer` {: .info}
&gt;
&gt; When you `use GenServer`, the `GenServer` module will
&gt; set `@behaviour GenServer` and define a `child_spec/1`
&gt; function, so your module can be used as a child
&gt; in a supervision tree.</pre>
<h3 id="avoid-macros" class="section-heading"> <a href="#avoid-macros">  Avoid macros </a> </h3> <p>Although the previous section could be summarized as "avoid macros", both topics are important enough to deserve their own sections.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/meta/macros.html">the official guide on macros</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even though Elixir attempts its best to provide a safe environment for macros, the major responsibility of writing clean code with macros falls on developers. Macros are harder to write than ordinary Elixir functions and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not necessary. So write macros responsibly.</p>
<p>Elixir already provides mechanisms to write your everyday code in a simple and readable fashion by using its data structures and functions. Macros should only be used as a last resort. Remember that <strong>explicit is better than implicit</strong>. <strong>Clear code is better than concise code</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you absolutely have to use a macro, make sure that a macro is not the only way the user can interface with your library and keep the amount of code generated by a macro to a minimum. For example, the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/logger/1.15/Logger.html"><code class="inline">Logger</code></a> module provides <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/logger/1.15/Logger.html#debug/2"><code class="inline">Logger.debug/2</code></a>, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/logger/1.15/Logger.html#info/2"><code class="inline">Logger.info/2</code></a> and friends as macros that are capable of extracting environment information, but a low-level mechanism for logging is still available with <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/logger/1.15/Logger.html#bare_log/3"><code class="inline">Logger.bare_log/3</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-using-processes-for-code-organization" class="section-heading"> <a href="#avoid-using-processes-for-code-organization">  Avoid using processes for code organization </a> </h3> <p>A developer must never use a process for code organization purposes. A process must be used to model runtime properties such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutable state and access to shared resources (such as ETS, files, and others)</li>
<li>Concurrency and distribution</li>
<li>Initialization, shutdown and restart logic (as seen in supervisors)</li>
<li>System messages such as timer messages and monitoring events</li>
</ul>
<p>In Elixir, code organization is done by modules and functions, processes are not necessary. For example, imagine you are implementing a calculator and you decide to put all the calculator operations behind a <a href="genserver.html"><code class="inline">GenServer</code></a>:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">def add(a, b) do
  GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:add, a, b})
end

def handle_call({:add, a, b}, _from, state) do
  {:reply, a + b, state}
end

def handle_call({:subtract, a, b}, _from, state) do
  {:reply, a - b, state}
end</pre>
<p>This is an anti-pattern not only because it convolutes the calculator logic but also because you put the calculator logic behind a single process that will potentially become a bottleneck in your system, especially as the number of calls grow. Instead, just define the functions directly:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">def add(a, b) do
  a + b
end

def subtract(a, b) do
  a - b
end</pre>
<p>Use processes only to model runtime properties, never for code organization. And even when you think something could be done in parallel with processes, often it is best to let the callers of your library decide how to parallelize, rather than impose a certain execution flow in users of your code.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-spawning-unsupervised-processes" class="section-heading"> <a href="#avoid-spawning-unsupervised-processes">  Avoid spawning unsupervised processes </a> </h3> <p>You should avoid spawning processes outside of a supervision tree, especially long-running ones. Instead, processes must be started inside supervision trees. This guarantees developers have full control over the initialization, restarts, and shutdown of the system.</p>
<p>If your application does not have a supervision tree, one can be added by changing <code class="inline">def application</code> inside <code class="inline">mix.exs</code> to include a <code class="inline">:mod</code> key with the application callback name:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">def application do
  [
    extra_applications: [:logger],
    mod: {MyApp.Application, []}
  ]
end</pre>
<p>and then defining a <code class="inline">my_app/application.ex</code> file with the following template:</p>
<pre data-language="elixir">defmodule MyApp.Application do
  # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html
  # for more information on OTP Applications
  @moduledoc false

  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      # Starts a worker by calling: MyApp.Worker.start_link(arg)
      # {MyApp.Worker, arg}
    ]

    # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html
    # for other strategies and supported options
    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end</pre>
<p>This is the same template generated by <code class="inline">mix new --sup</code>.</p>
<p>Each process started with the application must be listed as a child under the <a href="supervisor.html"><code class="inline">Supervisor</code></a> above. We call those "static processes" because they are known upfront. For handling dynamic processes, such as the ones started during requests and other user inputs, look at the <a href="dynamicsupervisor.html"><code class="inline">DynamicSupervisor</code></a> module.</p>
<p>One of the few times where it is acceptable to start a process outside of a supervision tree is with <a href="task.html#async/1"><code class="inline">Task.async/1</code></a> and <a href="task.html#await/2"><code class="inline">Task.await/2</code></a>. Opposite to <a href="task.html#start_link/1"><code class="inline">Task.start_link/1</code></a>, the <code class="inline">async/await</code> mechanism gives you full control over the spawned process life cycle - which is also why you must always call <a href="task.html#await/2"><code class="inline">Task.await/2</code></a> after starting a task with <a href="task.html#async/1"><code class="inline">Task.async/1</code></a>. Even though, if your application is spawning multiple async processes, you should consider using <a href="task.supervisor.html"><code class="inline">Task.Supervisor</code></a> for better visibility when instrumenting and monitoring the system.</p> <div class="bottom-actions"> <div class="bottom-actions-item"> <a href="compatibility-and-deprecations.html" class="bottom-actions-button" rel="prev"> <span class="subheader"> ← Previous Page </span> <span class="title"> Compatibility and Deprecations </span> </a> </div> <div class="bottom-actions-item"> <a href="naming-conventions.html" class="bottom-actions-button" rel="next"> <span class="subheader"> Next Page → </span> <span class="title"> Naming Conventions </span> </a> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
