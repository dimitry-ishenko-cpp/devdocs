<h1>Height and Width</h1>
<p>A component's height and width determine its size on the screen.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-dimensions">Fixed Dimensions</h2>
<p>The general way to set the dimensions of a component is by adding a fixed <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> to style. All dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels.</p>
<p>Setting dimensions this way is common for components whose size should always be fixed to a number of points and not calculated based on screen size.</p>
caution<p>There is no universal mapping from points to physical units of measurement. This means that a component with fixed dimensions might not have the same physical size, across different devices and screen sizes. However, this difference is unnoticeable for most use cases.</p>
<h2 id="flex-dimensions">Flex Dimensions</h2>
<p>Use <code>flex</code> in a component's style to have the component expand and shrink dynamically based on available space. Normally you will use <code>flex: 1</code>, which tells a component to fill all available space, shared evenly amongst other components with the same parent. The larger the <code>flex</code> given, the higher the ratio of space a component will take compared to its siblings.</p>
info<p>A component can only expand to fill available space if its parent has dimensions greater than <code>0</code>. If a parent does not have either a fixed <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> or <code>flex</code>, the parent will have dimensions of <code>0</code> and the <code>flex</code> children will not be visible.</p>
<p>After you can control a component's size, the next step is to <a href="flexbox.html">learn how to lay it out on the screen</a>.</p>
<h2 id="percentage-dimensions">Percentage Dimensions</h2>
<p>If you want to fill a certain portion of the screen, but you <em>don't</em> want to use the <code>flex</code> layout, you <em>can</em> use <strong>percentage values</strong> in the component's style. Similar to flex dimensions, percentage dimensions require parent with a defined size.</p><div class="_attribution">
