<h1>Using a ScrollView</h1>
<p>The <a href="scrollview.html">ScrollView</a> is a generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views. The scrollable items can be heterogeneous, and you can scroll both vertically and horizontally (by setting the <code>horizontal</code> property).</p>
<p>This example creates a vertical <code>ScrollView</code> with both images and text mixed together.</p>
<p>ScrollViews can be configured to allow paging through views using swiping gestures by using the <code>pagingEnabled</code> props. Swiping horizontally between views can also be implemented on Android using the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-viewpager" rel="noopener noreferrer">ViewPager</a> component.</p>
<p>On iOS a ScrollView with a single item can be used to allow the user to zoom content. Set up the <code>maximumZoomScale</code> and <code>minimumZoomScale</code> props and your user will be able to use pinch and expand gestures to zoom in and out.</p>
<p>The ScrollView works best to present a small number of things of a limited size. All the elements and views of a <code>ScrollView</code> are rendered, even if they are not currently shown on the screen. If you have a long list of items which cannot fit on the screen, you should use a <code>FlatList</code> instead.
