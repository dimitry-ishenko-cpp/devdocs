<p>We recommend using the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code</a> code editor and its handy <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.vscode-react-native" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native tools</a>.</p>
<h2 id="platforms-to-try">Platforms to try</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.expo.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expo</a> is a framework of tools and services for React Native that focuses on helping you build, ship, and iterate on your app, to use preview deployment workflows that are popular with web development, and to automate your development workflows. Expo also makes it possible to build React Native apps without ever touching Xcode or Android Studio, and it doesn't get in the way if you want to use those tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/infinitered/ignite" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ignite</a> is a starter kit CLI with several React Native boilerplates. The latest, <a href="https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ignite Bowser</a>, uses MobX-State-Tree for state management, React Navigation, and other common libraries. It has generators for components, models, and more, and supports Expo out of the box. If you are looking for a preconfigured tech stack, Ignite could be perfect for you.</p>
<h2 id="example-apps">Example Apps</h2>
<p>Try out apps from the <a href="https://reactnative.dev/showcase" rel="noopener noreferrer">Showcase</a> to see what React Native is capable of! Looking for something more hands on? Check out this <a href="https://github.com/ReactNativeNews/React-Native-Apps" rel="noopener noreferrer">set of example apps on GitHub</a>. You can look at their source code—try running one on a simulator or device.</p>
<h2 id="find-make-and-share-your-own-native-components-and-modules">Find, make, and share your own Native Components and Modules</h2>
<p>React Native has a community of thousands of developers like you making content, tools, tutorials—and Native Components!</p>
<p>Can’t find what you’re looking for in the Core Components? Visit <a href="https://reactnative.directory" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native Directory</a> to find what the community has been creating.</p>
<p>Interested in making your own Native Component or Module? Making modules for your own use case and sharing them with others on NPM and GitHub helps grow the React Native ecosystem and community! Read the guides to making your own Native Modules (<a href="native-modules-android.html">Android</a>, <a href="native-modules-ios.html">iOS</a>) and Native Components (<a href="native-components-android.html">Android</a>, <a href="native-components-ios.html">iOS</a>).</p><div class="_attribution">
