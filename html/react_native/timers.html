<h1>Timers</h1>
<p>Timers are an important part of an application and React Native implements the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Timeouts_and_intervals" rel="noopener noreferrer">browser timers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="timers">Timers</h2>
<ul>
<li>setTimeout, clearTimeout</li>
<li>setInterval, clearInterval</li>
<li>setImmediate, clearImmediate</li>
<li>requestAnimationFrame, cancelAnimationFrame</li>
</ul>
<p><code>requestAnimationFrame(fn)</code> is not the same as <code>setTimeout(fn, 0)</code> - the former will fire after all the frames have flushed, whereas the latter will fire as quickly as possible (over 1000x per second on a iPhone 5S).</p>
<p><code>setImmediate</code> is executed at the end of the current JavaScript execution block, right before sending the batched response back to native. Note that if you call <code>setImmediate</code> within a <code>setImmediate</code> callback, it will be executed right away, it won't yield back to native in between.</p>
<p>The <code>Promise</code> implementation uses <code>setImmediate</code> as its asynchronicity implementation.</p>
note<p>When debugging on Android, if the times between the debugger and device have drifted; things such as animation, event behavior, etc., might not work properly or the results may not be accurate. Please correct this by running <code>adb shell "date `date +%m%d%H%M%Y.%S%3N`"</code> on your debugger machine. Root access is required for the use in real device.</p>
<h2 id="interactionmanager">InteractionManager</h2>
<p>One reason why well-built native apps feel so smooth is by avoiding expensive operations during interactions and animations. In React Native, we currently have a limitation that there is only a single JS execution thread, but you can use <code>InteractionManager</code> to make sure long-running work is scheduled to start after any interactions/animations have completed.</p>
<p>Applications can schedule tasks to run after interactions with the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="jsx">InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() =&gt; {
  // ...long-running synchronous task...
});</pre>

<p>Compare this to other scheduling alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>requestAnimationFrame(): for code that animates a view over time.</li>
<li>setImmediate/setTimeout/setInterval(): run code later, note this may delay animations.</li>
<li>runAfterInteractions(): run code later, without delaying active animations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The touch handling system considers one or more active touches to be an 'interaction' and will delay <code>runAfterInteractions()</code> callbacks until all touches have ended or been cancelled.</p>
<p>InteractionManager also allows applications to register animations by creating an interaction 'handle' on animation start, and clearing it upon completion:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="jsx">var handle = InteractionManager.createInteractionHandle();
// run animation... (`runAfterInteractions` tasks are queued)
// later, on animation completion:
InteractionManager.clearInteractionHandle(handle);
// queued tasks run if all handles were cleared</pre>
