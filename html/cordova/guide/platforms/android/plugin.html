<h1 id="android-plugin-development-guide">Android Plugin Development Guide</h1> <p>This section provides details for how to implement native plugin code on the Android platform. Before reading this, see the <a href="../../hybrid/plugins/index.html">Plugin Development Guide</a> for an overview of the plugin's structure and its common JavaScript interface. This section continues to demonstrate the sample <em>echo</em> plugin that communicates from the Cordova webview to the native platform and back. For another sample, see also the comments in <a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/blob/master/framework/src/org/apache/cordova/CordovaPlugin.java">CordovaPlugin.java</a>.</p> <p>Android plugins are based on Cordova-Android, which is built from an Android WebView with a native bridge. The native portion of an Android plugin consists of at least one Java class that extends the <code>CordovaPlugin</code> class and overrides one of its <code>execute</code> methods.</p> <h2 id="plugin-class-mapping">Plugin Class Mapping</h2> <p>The plugin's JavaScript interface uses the <code>cordova.exec</code> method as follows:</p> <pre data-language="js">exec(&lt;successFunction&gt;, &lt;failFunction&gt;, &lt;service&gt;, &lt;action&gt;, [&lt;args&gt;]);
</pre> <p>This marshals a request from the WebView to the Android native side, effectively calling the <code>action</code> method on the <code>service</code> class, with additional arguments passed in the <code>args</code> array.</p> <p>Whether you distribute a plugin as Java file or as a <em>jar</em> file of its own, the plugin must be specified in your Cordova-Android application's <code>res/xml/config.xml</code> file. See Application Plugins for more information on how to use the <code>plugin.xml</code> file to inject this <code>feature</code> element:</p> <pre data-language="xml">&lt;feature name="&lt;service_name&gt;"&gt;
    &lt;param name="android-package" value="&lt;full_name_including_namespace&gt;" /&gt;
&lt;/feature&gt;
</pre> <p>The service name matches the one used in the JavaScript <code>exec</code> call. The value is the Java class's fully qualified namespace identifier. Otherwise, the plugin may compile but still be unavailable to Cordova.</p> <h2 id="plugin-initialization-and-lifetime">Plugin Initialization and Lifetime</h2> <p>One instance of a plugin object is created for the life of each <code>WebView</code>. Plugins are not instantiated until they are first referenced by a call from JavaScript, unless <code>&lt;param&gt;</code> with an <code>onload</code> <code>name</code> attribute is set to <code>"true"</code> in <code>config.xml</code>. For example,</p> <pre data-language="xml">&lt;feature name="Echo"&gt;
    &lt;param name="android-package" value="&lt;full_name_including_namespace&gt;" /&gt;
    &lt;param name="onload" value="true" /&gt;
&lt;/feature&gt;
</pre> <p>Plugins should use the <code>initialize</code> method for their start-up logic.</p> <pre data-language="java">@Override
public void initialize(CordovaInterface cordova, CordovaWebView webView) {
    super.initialize(cordova, webView);
    // your init code here
}
</pre> <p>Plugins also have access to Android lifecycle events and can handle them by extending one of the provided methods (<code>onResume</code>, <code>onDestroy</code>, etc). Plugins with long-running requests, background activity such as media playback, listeners, or internal state should implement the <code>onReset()</code> method. It executes when the <code>WebView</code> navigates to a new page or refreshes, which reloads the JavaScript.</p> <h2 id="writing-an-android-java-plugin">Writing an Android Java Plugin</h2> <p>A JavaScript call fires off a plugin request to the native side, and the corresponding Java plugin is mapped properly in the <code>config.xml</code> file, but what does the final Android Java Plugin class look like? Whatever is dispatched to the plugin with JavaScript's <code>exec</code> function is passed into the plugin class's <code>execute</code> method. Most <code>execute</code> implementations look like this:</p> <pre data-language="java">@Override
public boolean execute(String action, JSONArray args, CallbackContext callbackContext) throws JSONException {
    if ("beep".equals(action)) {
        this.beep(args.getLong(0));
        callbackContext.success();
        return true;
    }
    return false;  // Returning false results in a "MethodNotFound" error.
}
</pre> <p>The JavaScript <code>exec</code> function's <code>action</code> parameter corresponds to a private class method to dispatch with optional parameters.</p> <p>When catching exceptions and returning errors, it's important for the sake of clarity that errors returned to JavaScript match Java's exception names as much as possible.</p> <h2 id="threading">Threading</h2> <p>The plugin's JavaScript does <em>not</em> run in the main thread of the <code>WebView</code> interface; instead, it runs on the <code>WebCore</code> thread, as does the <code>execute</code> method. If you need to interact with the user interface, you should use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#runOnUiThread(java.lang.Runnable)">Activity's <code>runOnUiThread</code></a> method like so:</p> <pre data-language="java">@Override
public boolean execute(String action, JSONArray args, final CallbackContext callbackContext) throws JSONException {
    if ("beep".equals(action)) {
        final long duration = args.getLong(0);
        cordova.getActivity().runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                ...
                callbackContext.success(); // Thread-safe.
            }
        });
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
</pre> <p>If you do not need to run on the UI thread, but do not wish to block the <code>WebCore</code> thread either, you should execute your code using the Cordova <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html"><code>ExecutorService</code></a> obtained with <code>cordova.getThreadPool()</code> like so:</p> <pre data-language="java">@Override
public boolean execute(String action, JSONArray args, final CallbackContext callbackContext) throws JSONException {
    if ("beep".equals(action)) {
        final long duration = args.getLong(0);
        cordova.getThreadPool().execute(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                ...
                callbackContext.success(); // Thread-safe.
            }
        });
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
</pre> <h2 id="adding-dependency-libraries">Adding Dependency Libraries</h2> <p>If your Android plugin has extra dependencies, they must be listed in the <code>plugin.xml</code> in one of two ways.</p> <p>The preferred way is to use the <code>&lt;framework /&gt;</code> tag (see the <a href="../../../plugin_ref/spec.html#framework/index.html">Plugin Specification</a> for more details). Specifying libraries in this manner allows them to be resolved via Gradle's <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management.html">Dependency Management logic</a>. This allows commonly used libraries such as <em>gson</em>, <em>android-support-v4</em>, and <em>google-play-services</em> to be used by multiple plugins without conflict.</p> <p>The second option is to use the <code>&lt;lib-file /&gt;</code> tag to specify the location of a jar file (see the <a href="../../../plugin_ref/spec.html#lib-file/index.html">Plugin Specification</a> for more details). This approach should only be used if you are sure that no other plugin will be depending on the library you are referencing (e.g. if the library is specific to your plugin). Otherwise, you risk causing build errors for users of your plugin if another plugin adds the same library. It is worth noting that Cordova app developers are not necessarily native developers, so native platform build errors can be especially frustrating.</p> <h2 id="echo-android-plugin-example">Echo Android Plugin Example</h2> <p>To match the JavaScript interface's <em>echo</em> feature described in Application Plugins, use the <code>plugin.xml</code> to inject a <code>feature</code> specification to the local platform's <code>config.xml</code> file:</p> <pre data-language="xml">&lt;platform name="android"&gt;
    &lt;config-file target="config.xml" parent="/*"&gt;
        &lt;feature name="Echo"&gt;
            &lt;param name="android-package" value="org.apache.cordova.plugin.Echo"/&gt;
        &lt;/feature&gt;
    &lt;/config-file&gt;

    &lt;source-file src="src/android/Echo.java" target-dir="src/org/apache/cordova/plugin" /&gt;
&lt;/platform&gt;
</pre> <p>Then add the following to the <code>src/android/Echo.java</code> file:</p> <pre data-language="java">package org.apache.cordova.plugin;

import org.apache.cordova.CordovaPlugin;
import org.apache.cordova.CallbackContext;

import org.json.JSONArray;
import org.json.JSONException;
import org.json.JSONObject;

/**
* This class echoes a string called from JavaScript.
*/
public class Echo extends CordovaPlugin {

@Override
public boolean execute(String action, JSONArray args, CallbackContext callbackContext) throws JSONException {
    if (action.equals("echo")) {
        String message = args.getString(0);
        this.echo(message, callbackContext);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

private void echo(String message, CallbackContext callbackContext) {
    if (message != null &amp;&amp; message.length() &gt; 0) {
        callbackContext.success(message);
    } else {
        callbackContext.error("Expected one non-empty string argument.");
    }
}
}
</pre> <p>The necessary imports at the top of the file extends the class from <code>CordovaPlugin</code>, whose <code>execute()</code> method it overrides to receive messages from <code>exec()</code>. The <code>execute()</code> method first tests the value of <code>action</code>, for which in this case there is only one valid <code>echo</code> value. Any other action returns <code>false</code> and results in an <code>INVALID_ACTION</code> error, which translates to an error callback invoked on the JavaScript side.</p> <p>Next, the method retrieves the echo string using the <code>args</code> object's <code>getString</code> method, specifying the first parameter passed to the method. After the value is passed to a private <code>echo</code> method, it is parameter-checked to make sure it is not <code>null</code> or an empty string, in which case <code>callbackContext.error()</code> invokes JavaScript's error callback. If the various checks pass, the <code>callbackContext.success()</code> passes the original <code>message</code> string back to JavaScript's success callback as a parameter.</p> <h2 id="android-integration">Android Integration</h2> <p>Android features an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html">Intent</a> system that allows processes to communicate with each other. Plugins have access to a <code>CordovaInterface</code> object, which can access the Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activity</a> that runs the application. This is the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html">Context</a> required to launch a new Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html">Intent</a>. The <code>CordovaInterface</code> allows plugins to start an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activity</a> for a result, and to set the callback plugin for when the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html">Intent</a> returns to the application.</p> <p>As of Cordova 2.0, Plugins can no longer directly access the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html">Context</a>, and the legacy <code>ctx</code> member is deprecated. All <code>ctx</code> methods exist on the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html">Context</a>, so both <code>getContext()</code> and <code>getActivity()</code> can return the required object.</p> <h2 id="android-permissions">Android Permissions</h2> <p>Android permissions until recently have been handled at install-time instead of runtime. These permissions are required to be declared on an application that uses the permissions, and these permissions need to be added to the Android Manifest. This can be accomplished by using the <code>config.xml</code> to inject these permissions in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file. The example below uses the Contacts permission.</p> <pre data-language="xml">&lt;config-file target="AndroidManifest.xml" parent="/*"&gt;
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" /&gt;
&lt;/config-file&gt;
</pre> <h3 id="runtime-permissions-cordova-android-5-0-0">Runtime Permissions (Cordova-Android 5.0.0+)</h3> <p>Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" introduced a new permissions model where the user can turn on and off permissions as necessary. This means that applications must handle these permission changes to be future-proof, which was the focus of the Cordova-Android 5.0.0 release.</p> <p>The permissions that need to be handled at runtime can be found in the Android Developer documentation <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html#perm-groups">here</a>.</p> <p>As far as a plugin is concerned, the permission can be requested by calling the permission method; the signature of which is as follows:</p> <pre data-language="java">cordova.requestPermission(CordovaPlugin plugin, int requestCode, String permission);
</pre> <p>To cut down on verbosity, it's standard practice to assign this to a local static variable:</p> <pre data-language="java">public static final String READ = Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS;
</pre> <p>It is also standard practice to define the requestCode as follows:</p> <pre data-language="java">public static final int SEARCH_REQ_CODE = 0;
</pre> <p>Then, in the exec method, the permission should be checked:</p> <pre data-language="java">if(cordova.hasPermission(READ))
{
    search(executeArgs);
}
else
{
    getReadPermission(SEARCH_REQ_CODE);
}
</pre> <p>In this case, we just call requestPermission:</p> <pre data-language="java">protected void getReadPermission(int requestCode)
{
    cordova.requestPermission(this, requestCode, READ);
}
</pre> <p>This will call the activity and cause a prompt to appear, asking for the permission. Once the user has the permission, the result must be handled with the <code>onRequestPermissionResult</code> method, which every plugin should override. An example of this can be found below:</p> <pre data-language="java">public void onRequestPermissionResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions,
                                         int[] grantResults) throws JSONException
{
    for(int r:grantResults)
    {
        if(r == PackageManager.PERMISSION_DENIED)
        {
            this.callbackContext.sendPluginResult(new PluginResult(PluginResult.Status.ERROR, PERMISSION_DENIED_ERROR));
            return;
        }
    }
    switch(requestCode)
    {
        case SEARCH_REQ_CODE:
            search(executeArgs);
            break;
        case SAVE_REQ_CODE:
            save(executeArgs);
            break;
        case REMOVE_REQ_CODE:
            remove(executeArgs);
            break;
    }
}
</pre> <p>The switch statement above would return from the prompt and, depending on the requestCode that was passed in, would call the respective method. It should be noted that permission prompts may stack if the execution is not handled correctly, and that this should be avoided.</p> <p>In addition to asking for permission for a single permission, it is also possible to request permissions for an entire group by defining the permissions array, as what is done with the Geolocation plugin:</p> <pre data-language="java">String [] permissions = { Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION };
</pre> <p>Then when requesting the permission, all that needs to be done is the following:</p> <pre data-language="java">cordova.requestPermissions(this, 0, permissions);
</pre> <p>This requests the permissions specified in the array. It's a good idea to provide a publicly accessible permissions array since this can be used by plugins that use your plugin as a dependency, although this is not required.</p> <h2 id="debugging-android-plugins">Debugging Android Plugins</h2> <p>Android debugging can be done with either Eclipse or Android Studio, although Android studio is recommended. Since Cordova-Android is currently used as a library project, and plugins are supported as source code, it is possible to debug the Java code inside a Cordova application just like a native Android application.</p> <h2 id="launching-other-activities">Launching Other Activities</h2> <p>There are special considerations to be made if your plugin launches an Activity that pushes the Cordova <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activity</a> to the background. The Android OS will destroy Activities in the background if the device is running low on memory. In that case, the <code>CordovaPlugin</code> instance will be destroyed as well. If your plugin is waiting on a result from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activity</a> it launched, a new instance of your plugin will be created when the Cordova <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activity</a> is brought back to the foreground and the result is obtained. However, state for the plugin will not be automatically saved or restored and the <code>CallbackContext</code> for the plugin will be lost. There are two methods that your <code>CordovaPlugin</code> may implement to handle this situation:</p> <pre data-language="java">/**
 * Called when the Activity is being destroyed (e.g. if a plugin calls out to an
 * external Activity and the OS kills the CordovaActivity in the background).
 * The plugin should save its state in this method only if it is awaiting the
 * result of an external Activity and needs to preserve some information so as
 * to handle that result; onRestoreStateForActivityResult() will only be called
 * if the plugin is the recipient of an Activity result
 *
 * @return  Bundle containing the state of the plugin or null if state does not
 *          need to be saved
 */
public Bundle onSaveInstanceState() {}

/**
 * Called when a plugin is the recipient of an Activity result after the
 * CordovaActivity has been destroyed. The Bundle will be the same as the one
 * the plugin returned in onSaveInstanceState()
 *
 * @param state             Bundle containing the state of the plugin
 * @param callbackContext   Replacement Context to return the plugin result to
 */
public void onRestoreStateForActivityResult(Bundle state, CallbackContext callbackContext) {}
</pre> <p>It is important to note that the above methods should only be used if your plugin launches an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activity</a> for a result and should only restore the state necessary to handle that Activity result. The state of the plugin will <em>NOT</em> be restored except in the case where an Activity result is obtained that your plugin requested using the <code>CordovaInterface</code>'s <code>startActivityForResult()</code> method and the Cordova Activity was destroyed by the OS while in the background.</p> <p>As part of <code>onRestoreStateForActivityResult()</code>, your plugin will be passed a replacement CallbackContext. It is important to realize that this CallbackContext <em>IS NOT</em> the same one that was destroyed with the Activity. The original callback is lost, and will not be fired in the javascript application. Instead, this replacement <code>CallbackContext</code> will return the result as part of the <a href="../../../cordova/events/events.html#resume/index.html"><code>resume</code></a> event that is fired when the application resumes. The payload of the <a href="../../../cordova/events/events.html#resume/index.html"><code>resume</code></a> event follows this structure:</p> <pre data-language="text">{
    action: "resume",
    pendingResult: {
        pluginServiceName: string,
        pluginStatus: string,
        result: any
    }
}
</pre> <ul> <li>
<code>pluginServiceName</code> will match the <a href="../../../plugin_ref/spec.html#name/index.html">name element</a> from your plugin.xml.</li> <li>
<code>pluginStatus</code> will be a String describing the status of the PluginResult passed to the CallbackContext. See PluginResult.java for the String values that correspond to plugin statuses</li> <li>
<code>result</code> will be whatever result the plugin passes to the CallbackContext (e.g. a String, a number, a JSON object, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>This <a href="../../../cordova/events/events.html#resume/index.html"><code>resume</code></a> payload will be passed to any callbacks that the javascript application has registered for the <a href="../../../cordova/events/events.html#resume/index.html"><code>resume</code></a> event. This means that the result is going <em>directly</em> to the Cordova application; your plugin will not have a chance to process the result with javascript before the application receives it. Consequently, you should strive to make the result returned by the native code as complete as possible and not rely on any javascript callbacks when launching activities.</p> <p>Be sure to communicate how the Cordova application should interpret the result they receive in the <a href="../../../cordova/events/events.html#resume/index.html"><code>resume</code></a> event. It is up to the Cordova application to maintain their own state and remember what requests they made and what arguments they provided if necessary. However, you should still clearly communicate the meaning of <code>pluginStatus</code> values and what sort of data is being returned in the <a href="../../../cordova/events/events.html#resume/index.html"><code>resume</code></a> field as part of your plugin's API.</p> <p>The complete sequence of events for launching an Activity is as follows</p> <ol> <li>The Cordova application makes a call to your plugin</li> <li>Your plugin launches an Activity for a result</li> <li>The Android OS destroys the Cordova Activity and your plugin instance <ul> <li><em><code>onSaveInstanceState()</code> is called</em></li> </ul>
</li> <li>The user interacts with your Activity and the Activity finishes</li> <li>The Cordova Activity is recreated and the Activity result is received <ul> <li><em><code>onRestoreStateForActivityResult()</code> is called</em></li> </ul>
</li> <li>
<code>onActivityResult()</code> is called and your plugin passes a result to the new CallbackContext</li> <li>The <a href="../../../cordova/events/events.html#resume/index.html"><code>resume</code></a> event is fired and received by the Cordova application</li> </ol> <p>Android provides a developer setting for debugging Activity destruction on low memory. Enable the "Don't keep activities" setting in the Developer Options menu on your device or emulator to simulate low memory scenarios. If your plugin launches external activities, you should always do some testing with this setting enabled to ensure that you are properly handling low memory scenarios.</p><div class="_attribution">
