<h2 id="platform-pinning">Platform Pinning</h2> <p>Cordova CLI pins the supported platform version in conjunction with the version of CLI that is being used.</p> <p>To see the pinned platforms for your CLI version, execute the command <code>cordova platform list</code> in a brand new project directory.</p> <p><strong>Example (Cordova CLI 9.x):</strong></p> <pre data-language="bash">$ cordova platform list
Installed platforms:

Available platforms:
  android ^8.0.0
  browser ^6.0.0
  electron ^1.0.0
  ios ^5.0.0
  osx ^5.0.0
  windows ^7.0.0
</pre> <p><em>Note: When a platform is installed, the "<strong>Installed platforms:</strong>" section will display the actual installed platform version. The installed platform will no longer display in the "<strong>Available platforms:</strong>" section until it is removed from the project.</em></p> <p>Starting from <strong>Cordova CLI 9</strong> and up, all platforms are pinned with an caret (<code>^</code>). It means that by installing a platform without a specified version, Cordova will fetch the latest version up to a minor release.</p> <p>In <strong>Cordova CLI 8</strong> and below, all platforms are pinned with a tilde (<code>~</code>). It means that by installing a platform without a specified version, Cordova will fetch the latest version up to a patch release.</p><div class="_attribution">
