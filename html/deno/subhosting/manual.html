<h1>About Subhosting</h1>
<div>
<p>Deno Subhosting is a robust platform designed to allow Software as a Service (SaaS) providers to securely run code written by their customers. The Subhosting API allows you to deploy untrusted code programmatically and at scale.</p> <h2 id="key-features" tabindex="-1">Key Features </h2> <ul> <li>
<strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Developers can write code in generic JavaScript or TypeScript without needing specific knowledge of Deno.</li> <li>
<strong>Standards Compliance:</strong> Deno supports standard JavaScript and TypeScript and integrates widely-used web APIs like <code data-language="ts">fetch</code> and <code data-language="ts">web cache</code>.</li> <li>
<strong>Deno-Specific Advanced Features:</strong> Offers advanced features like <code data-language="ts">KV</code> (Key-Value stores) which extend beyond typical browser capabilities.</li> <li>
<strong>Rapid Deployment:</strong> Deno’s cloud products are designed to support extremely short deployment times that range from less than a second for simple applications, to around ten seconds for complex websites with numerous dependencies.</li> <li>
<strong>Improved developer experience</strong>: Subhosting will manage the extensive effort of setting up secure infrastructure to run untrusted code in a public cloud for you.</li> </ul> <h2 id="overview-of-deno-cloud-offerings---deno-deploy-and-deno-subhosting" tabindex="-1">Overview of Deno Cloud Offerings - Deno Deploy and Deno Subhosting </h2> <p>Deno provides two distinct cloud offerings, Deno Deploy and Deno Subhosting, each designed to support specific use cases while leveraging the same underlying infrastructure.</p> <h3 id="deno-deploy" tabindex="-1">Deno Deploy </h3> <p>Deno Deploy is optimized for individual developers and small teams focused on developing and iterating on a limited set of first-party projects. This solution is ideal for hosting websites or applications, with deployment processes typically managed through GitHub integrations.</p> <ul> <li>Target Audience: Individual developers and small development teams.</li> <li>Deployment Integration: Primarily through GitHub for continuous integration and delivery.</li> <li>Use Cases: Hosting websites and applications.</li> </ul> <h3 id="deno-subhosting" tabindex="-1">Deno Subhosting </h3> <p>In contrast, Deno Subhosting is engineered to securely manage a larger volume of projects and deployments. It supports the deployment of untrusted code or functions through an API, making it suitable for scenarios involving multiple end-users contributing code.</p> <ul> <li>Target Audience: SaaS platforms requiring the capability to host customer-generated, untrusted code securely.</li> <li>Deployment Mechanism: Through a robust API designed for scalability and security.</li> <li>Use Cases: Large scale project hosting where end-users contribute the code.</li> </ul> <p>The steps to implement subhosting are roughly as follows:</p> <ol> <li>
<a href="manual/quick_start.html">Create an organization</a> and get an access token for the REST API</li> <li>
<a href="manual/planning_your_implementation.html">Create a project</a>, and then create your first deployment for that project</li> </ol> <p>Using these techniques, you can package up user code as "deployments", and execute that code on a Deno-provisioned URL or a <a href="api.html#custom-domains">custom URL</a> you can configure yourself.</p> <h2 id="rest-api-reference-and-openapi-spec" tabindex="-1">REST API reference and OpenAPI spec </h2> <p>For a complete reference for the REST API used to implement subhosting, you can <a href="https://apidocs.deno.com">check out the docs here</a>. The Deno Deploy REST API also provides an <a href="https://api.deno.com/v1/openapi.json">OpenAPI specification</a> which can be used with <a href="https://openapi.tools/">a number of OpenAPI-compatible tools</a>.</p> <p>We also offer SDKs in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/subhosting">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/subhosting/0.0.1a0/">Python</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/denoland/subhosting-go">Go</a>.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
