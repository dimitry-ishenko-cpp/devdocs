<h1>Deployment events</h1>
<div>
<p>During the lifetime of a deployment execution, several events are recorded into its execution logs. Using the <a href="https://apidocs.deno.com/#get-/deployments/-deploymentId-/app_logs">deployment logs API</a>, these event logs can be used to understand and monitor the behavior of your deployments.</p> <h2 id="boot" tabindex="-1">Boot </h2> <div class="relative">
<pre class="language-json" tabindex="0"><code data-language="json"><span class="token string">"isolate start time: 96.67 ms (user time: 6.13 ms)"</span>
</code></pre>   </div>
<p>The <code data-language="ts">boot</code> event is emitted after the deployment has successfully booted and is running. It logs the time elapsed since receiving the initial request that prompted the deployment to boot, until the deployment is ready to start handling it. Alongside the start time as a whole, the event also logs the part of it that was spent executing the deployment's Javascript code (referred to as the "user time").</p> <h2 id="memory-limit" tabindex="-1">Memory Limit </h2> <div class="relative">
<pre class="language-json" tabindex="0"><code data-language="json"><span class="token string">"Memory limit exceeded, terminated"</span>
</code></pre>   </div>
<p>The <code data-language="ts">memory-limit</code> event is emitted when the deployment is terminated for exceeding the <a href="https://deno.com/deploy/pricing?subhosting">memory limit allowed per deployment execution</a>. In some cases, it is followed by an event URN to cross-reference it with any observability artifact generated as a result:</p> <div class="relative">
<pre class="language-json" tabindex="0"><code data-language="json"><span class="token string">"Memory limit exceeded, terminated (urn:dd-hard-memory-limit:deno:pcx8pcbpc34b:048730b1-0e1f-4df7-8f92-e64233415322)"</span>
</code></pre>   </div>
<p>All the requests that where in-flight when the deployment was terminated receive a 502 response with the code <code data-language="ts">"MEMORY_LIMIT"</code>.</p> <h2 id="cpu-time-limit" tabindex="-1">CPU Time Limit </h2> <div class="relative">
<pre class="language-json" tabindex="0"><code data-language="json"><span class="token string">"CPU time limit exceeded, see https://deno.com/deploy/docs/pricing-and-limit (urn:dd-time-limit:deno:pcx8pcbpc34b:b8c729c0-e17a-4ce1-a6df-4267cbeb6d5c)"</span>
</code></pre>   </div>
<p>The <code data-language="ts">time-limit</code> event is emitted when the deployment is terminated for exceeding the <a href="https://deno.com/deploy/pricing?subhosting">CPU-time limit allowed per request</a>. The event URN included in the log can be used to cross-reference it with any observability artifact generated as a result.</p> <p>All the requests that where in-flight when the deployment was terminated receive a 502 response with the code <code data-language="ts">"TIME_LIMIT"</code>.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
