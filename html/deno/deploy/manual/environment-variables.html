<h1>Environment variables</h1>
<div>
<p>Environment variables are useful to store values like access tokens of web services. Each deployment has a set of environment variables defined at the moment of creation and accessible from the code via the <code data-language="ts">Deno.env</code> API. There are 2 ways to define the environment variables of a deployment:</p> <h2 id="project-environment-variables" tabindex="-1">Project environment variables </h2> <p>You can define environment variables at the project level. When you create a deployment, it will get the set of environment variables the project has defined <em>at that particular moment</em>.</p> <p>For convenience, When you change the environment variables of a project, the current production deployment is <em>redeployed</em>, creating a new production deployment with the new set of environment variables.</p> 
<div class="admonition note"> <div class="title">Note</div>  <p>Deployments are immutable, including their environment variables. Changing the environment variables of a project does not change the environment variables of existing deployments.</p> 
</div>  <p>To add an environment variable to your project, click on the <strong>Settings</strong> button on the project page and then on <strong>Environment Variables</strong> from the sidebar. Fill in the key/value fields and click on "Add" to add an environment variable to your project.</p> <p><img src="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/docs-images/fauna2.png" alt="environment_variable"></p> <p>Updating an existing environment variable works the same way. Click on the "Add Variable" button, enter the same name of the environment variable you wish to update and enter the new value. Click on the "Save" button to complete the update.</p> <h2 id="deployment-environment-variables" tabindex="-1">Deployment environment variables </h2> <p>When deploying using <code data-language="ts">deployctl</code>, you can specify environment variables <a href="deployctl.html#environment-variables">using the <code data-language="ts">--env</code> or <code data-language="ts">--env-file</code> flags</a>, complementing the environment variables already defined for the project. You can also pass multiple <code data-language="ts">--env-file</code> arguments (e.g., <code data-language="ts">--env-file=.env.one --env-file=.env.two</code>) to include variables from multiple files.</p> 
<div class="admonition note"> <div class="title">Note</div>  <p>When multiple declarations for the same environment variable exist within a single <code data-language="ts">.env</code> file, the first occurrence is applied. However, if the same variable is defined across multiple <code data-language="ts">.env</code> files (using multiple <code data-language="ts">--env-file</code> arguments), the value from the last file specified takes precedence. This means that the first occurrence found in the last <code data-language="ts">.env</code> file listed will be applied.</p> 
</div>  <p>These env variables will be specific for the deployment being created.</p> <h3 id="default-environment-variables" tabindex="-1">Default environment variables </h3> <p>Every deployment has the following environment variables preset, which you can access from your code.</p> <ol> <li> <p><code data-language="ts">DENO_REGION</code></p> <p>It holds the region code of the region in which the deployment is running. You can use this variable to serve region-specific content.</p> <p>You can refer to the region code from the <a href="regions.html">regions page</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code data-language="ts">DENO_DEPLOYMENT_ID</code></p> <p>It holds the ID of the deployment.</p> </li> </ol> </div><div class="_attribution">
