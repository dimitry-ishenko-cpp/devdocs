We may also receive personal information when you comment on our social media advertisements, post comments about us, or tag us in a public-facing social media post. Personal information may also be collected by the third-party social media sites that host our social media pages. These sites may provide aggregate information and analysis to us about visitors’ use of our social media pages. This allows us to better understand and analyze our user growth, general demographic information about the users of these pages, and interaction with the content that we post. Overall, this information may be used to help us understand the types of visitors and users of our social media pages and use of the content. This Privacy Policy does not cover personal information collected by such third-party social media sites. For more information on their privacy and security practices please review the privacy policies and terms of use on their respective websites.</p> <p><strong>3.

Third parties such as advertising networks and analytics providers may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and devices when you access or use the Sites.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>II. How We Use And Share Your Information</strong></p> <p>Deno uses the Information for the purpose for which it was collected and in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. These functions include operation, maintenance and improvements to the Sites, providing our products and services, solicitation of your feedback, gaining a better understanding of our customers and visitors of our Sites, responding to your requests and questions, hosting events, and informing you about our organization, products, services, events, and other areas of interest.</p> <p><em>Analytics Services</em>. We may use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand and analyze how Site visitors use our services. For more information on how Google Analytics uses data collected through our Sites, visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</a>.</p> <p><em>Aggregated Data</em>. We may analyze your personal information in aggregate form which does not identify you personally (“<strong>Aggregated Data</strong>”). The Aggregated Data may be used to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Sites, shared with our affiliates, agents, and business partners, and otherwise used and disclosed for lawful business purposes. We do not re-identify de-identified or aggregated information.</p> <p><em>Service Providers/Vendors</em>. Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services, for example web hosting, disaster recovery, client survey and marketing, and data storage.</p> <p><em>Reorganization</em>. If, in the future, Deno undergoes a corporate, partnership, or business reorganization, we may transfer the Information, including personal information, to the new or surviving entity.</p> <p><em>Protection of Rights and Compliance</em>. We may use your Information to protect the rights, privacy or safety you, us or others; to ensure our compliance with legal and contractual requirements; and to prevent and investigate illegal, unethical, or unauthorized activities (including cyberattacks and identity theft).</p> <p>If Deno intends on using or disclosing your personal information in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the personal information is collected.</p> <p><strong>III. How We Protect Your Information</strong></p> <p>We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the personal information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet.</p> <p><strong>IV. Data Retention</strong></p> <p>Deno determines the retention period for all Information based on the purposes for which we collect and/or receive the Information and/or tax, legal and regulatory requirements. In addition to this, we may consider other factors, such as the nature and sensitivity of the data, and whether we can achieve the purpose for which we collected the data through other means.</p> <p><strong>V. Your Privacy Choices</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Your Information</strong></p> <p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of the personal information we maintain about you, and we will endeavor to respond promptly to your request. In order to make such a request, please contact us as indicated below.</p> <p><strong>2. Marketing Communications</strong></p> <p>You may opt-out of marketing-related emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any marketing email or emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@deno.com.html">support@deno.com</a>. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner. Please note that even if you opt-out of marketing-related emails, you will continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.</p> <p><strong>3. Tracking Technology</strong></p> <p>You can choose not to permit tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, when you use our services, but blocking some types of these tracking technologies may interfere with your experience.</p> <p><em>Browser-Based Opt-Outs</em>. You may be able to disable tracking technologies using your web browser settings. Please review your browser’s instructions or visit <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/">All About Cookies</a> for general information. Note that your web browser may have settings that allow you to transmit a “Do Not Track” signal when you use online services. Like many websites, our Sites are not currently designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from browsers.</p> <p><em>Self-Regulatory Program Opt-Outs</em>. Two self-regulatory programs are available to help you control the use of tracking technologies on your browsers — the <a href="https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://thenai.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>. Both programs help to regulate vendors in the digital advertising space. One function of their self-regulatory programs is to give you the ability to opt out of targeted (or interest-based) advertising, including the use of tracking technologies, from their member companies. You can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Your Ad Choices website to opt out of targeted advertising for participating vendors. The Network Advertising Initiative similarly assists with opt outs through their Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising webpage.</p> <p><em>Google Analytics Opt-Out.</em> To opt out of Google Analytics cookies, visit Google’s <a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/personalizationoff">My Ad Center</a> and/or download the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On.</p> <p><strong>VI.
