<h1>CI and GitHub Actions</h1>
<div>
<p>Deno Deploy's Git integration enables deployment of code changes that are pushed to a GitHub repository. Commits on the production branch will be deployed as a production deployment. Commits on all other branches will be deployed as a preview deployment.</p> <p>There are two modes of operation for the Git integration:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Automatic</strong>: Deno Deploy will automatically pull code and assets from your repository source every time you push, and deploy it. This mode is very fast, but does not allow for a build step. <em>This is the recommended mode for most users.</em>
</li> <li>
<strong>GitHub Actions</strong>: In this mode, you push your code and assets to Deno Deploy from a GitHub Actions workflow. This allows you to perform a build step before deploying.</li> </ul> <p>Deno Deploy will select an appropriate mode based on your custom deployment configuration. Below, we go into more detail about the different configurations for <strong>Automatic</strong> and <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> mode.</p> <h2 id="automatic" tabindex="-1">Automatic </h2> <p>If your project doesn't require any additional build steps, then the system choose <strong>Automatic</strong> mode. The entrypoint file is simply the file that Deno Deploy will run.</p> <h2 id="github-actions" tabindex="-1">GitHub Actions </h2> <p>If you enter a command in <strong>Install Step</strong> and/or <strong>Build Step</strong> in the <strong>Project Configuration</strong>, Deno Deploy will create a necessary GitHub Actions workflow file and push it into your repository. In this workflow file, we leverage the <code data-language="ts">deployctl</code> <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deployctl/blob/main/action/README.md">Github action</a> to deploy your project. You can do whatever you need to do, such as running a build command, before deploying it to Deno Deploy.</p> <p>To configure preprocessing commands you want to run, click <strong>Show advanced options</strong> button that appears after choosing your git repository. Then enter values as needed to input boxes.</p> 
<div class="admonition tip"> <div class="title">Tip</div>  <p>For example, if you want to enable <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/concepts/ahead-of-time-builds">ahead-of-time builds</a> for a Fresh project, you will enter <code data-language="ts">deno task build</code> in the <strong>Build Step</strong> box.</p> <p>See also <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started/deploy-to-production">the Fresh doc</a> for deploying a Fresh project to Deno Deploy.</p> 
</div>  <p>The GitHub Actions workflow file that Deno Deploy generates and pushes to your repository looks like as follows.</p> <div>
<div class="markdownBlockTitle">.github/workflows/deploy.yml</div>
