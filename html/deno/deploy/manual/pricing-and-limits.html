<h1>Pricing and limitations</h1>
<div>
<p>Please see <a href="https://www.deno.com/deploy/pricing">our pricing page</a> for the overview of the available features in all plans. If you have a use case that exceeds any of these limits, <a href="mailto:deploy@deno.com.html">please reach out</a>.</p> <p>No uptime guarantees are provided during the initial public beta for Deno Deploy. Access to the service will be controlled by <a href="acceptable-use-policy.html">our acceptable use policy</a>. Any user we deem to be in violation of this policy, runs the risk of having their account terminated.</p> <h2 id="maximum-size-for-deployments" tabindex="-1">Maximum size for deployments </h2> <p>When uploading assets to a deployment, the total size of all files within the deployment (source files and static files) <strong>should not exceed 1 gigabyte</strong>.</p> <h2 id="tls-proxying" tabindex="-1">TLS proxying </h2> <p>TLS termination is required for outgoing connections to port 443 (the port used for HTTPS). Using <a href="../../api/deno/~/deno.connect.html">Deno.connect</a> to connect to these ports is prohibited. If you need to establish a TLS connection to port 443, please use <a href="../../api/deno/~/deno.connecttls.html">Deno.connectTls</a> instead. <code data-language="ts">fetch</code> is not impacted by this restriction.</p> <p>This restriction is in place because connecting to port 443 without terminating TLS is frequently used in TLS-over-TLS proxies, which are prohibited on Deno Deploy as per <a href="acceptable-use-policy.html">our acceptable use policy</a>.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
