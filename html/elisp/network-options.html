 <h4 class="subsection">Network Options</h4> <p>The following network options can be specified when you create a network process. Except for <code>:reuseaddr</code>, you can also set or modify these options later, using <code>set-network-process-option</code>. </p> <p>For a server process, the options specified with <code>make-network-process</code> are not inherited by the client connections, so you will need to set the necessary options for each child connection as it is created. </p> <dl compact> <dt>:bindtodevice <var>device-name</var>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If <var>device-name</var> is a non-empty string identifying a network interface name (see <code>network-interface-list</code>), only handle packets received on that interface. If <var>device-name</var> is <code>nil</code> (the default), handle packets received on any interface. </p> <p>Using this option may require special privileges on some systems. </p> </dd> <dt>:broadcast <var>broadcast-flag</var>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If <var>broadcast-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> for a datagram process, the process will receive datagram packet sent to a broadcast address, and be able to send packets to a broadcast address. This is ignored for a stream connection. </p> </dd> <dt>:dontroute <var>dontroute-flag</var>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If <var>dontroute-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the process can only send to hosts on the same network as the local host. </p> </dd> <dt>:keepalive <var>keepalive-flag</var>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If <var>keepalive-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> for a stream connection, enable exchange of low-level keep-alive messages. </p> </dd> <dt>:linger <var>linger-arg</var>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If <var>linger-arg</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, wait for successful transmission of all queued packets on the connection before it is deleted (see <code>delete-process</code>). If <var>linger-arg</var> is an integer, it specifies the maximum time in seconds to wait for queued packets to be sent before closing the connection. The default is <code>nil</code>, which means to discard unsent queued packets when the process is deleted. </p> </dd> <dt>:oobinline <var>oobinline-flag</var>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If <var>oobinline-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> for a stream connection, receive out-of-band data in the normal data stream. Otherwise, ignore out-of-band data. </p> </dd> <dt>:priority <var>priority</var>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Set the priority for packets sent on this connection to the integer <var>priority</var>. The interpretation of this number is protocol specific; such as setting the TOS (type of service) field on IP packets sent on this connection. It may also have system dependent effects, such as selecting a specific output queue on the network interface. </p> </dd> <dt>:reuseaddr <var>reuseaddr-flag</var>
</dt> <dd><p>If <var>reuseaddr-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> (the default) for a stream server process, allow this server to reuse a specific port number (see <code>:service</code>), unless another process on this host is already listening on that port. If <var>reuseaddr-flag</var> is <code>nil</code>, there may be a period of time after the last use of that port (by any process on the host) where it is not possible to make a new server on that port. </p></dd> </dl> <dl> <dt id="set-network-process-option">Function: <strong>set-network-process-option</strong> <em>process option value &amp;optional no-error</em>
</dt> <dd>
<p>This function sets or modifies a network option for network process <var>process</var>. The accepted options and values are as for <code>make-network-process</code>. If <var>no-error</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this function returns <code>nil</code> instead of signaling an error if <var>option</var> is not a supported option. If the function successfully completes, it returns <code>t</code>. </p> <p>The current setting of an option is available via the <code>process-contact</code> function. </p>
