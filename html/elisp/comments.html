 <h3 class="section">Comments</h3>   <p>A <em>comment</em> is text that is written in a program only for the sake of humans that read the program, and that has no effect on the meaning of the program. In Lisp, an unescaped semicolon (‘<samp>;</samp>’) starts a comment if it is not within a string or character constant. The comment continues to the end of line. The Lisp reader discards comments; they do not become part of the Lisp objects which represent the program within the Lisp system. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>#@<var>count</var></samp>’ construct, which skips the next <var>count</var> characters, is useful for program-generated comments containing binary data. The Emacs Lisp byte compiler uses this in its output files (see <a href="byte-compilation.html">Byte Compilation</a>). It isn’t meant for source files, however. </p> <p>See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Comment-Tips.html">Comment Tips</a>, for conventions for formatting comments. </p><div class="_attribution">
