 <h4 class="subsection">Components of a Lambda Expression</h4> <p>A lambda expression is a list that looks like this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(lambda (<var>arg-variables</var>…)
  [<var>documentation-string</var>]
  [<var>interactive-declaration</var>]
  <var>body-forms</var>…)
</pre>
</div>  <p>The first element of a lambda expression is always the symbol <code>lambda</code>. This indicates that the list represents a function. The reason functions are defined to start with <code>lambda</code> is so that other lists, intended for other uses, will not accidentally be valid as functions. </p> <p>The second element is a list of symbols—the argument variable names (see <a href="argument-list.html">Argument List</a>). This is called the <em>lambda list</em>. When a Lisp function is called, the argument values are matched up against the variables in the lambda list, which are given local bindings with the values provided. See <a href="local-variables.html">Local Variables</a>. </p> <p>The documentation string is a Lisp string object placed within the function definition to describe the function for the Emacs help facilities. See <a href="function-documentation.html">Function Documentation</a>. </p> <p>The interactive declaration is a list of the form <code>(interactive
<var>code-string</var>)</code>. This declares how to provide arguments if the function is used interactively. Functions with this declaration are called <em>commands</em>; they can be called using <kbd>M-x</kbd> or bound to a key. Functions not intended to be called in this way should not have interactive declarations. See <a href="defining-commands.html">Defining Commands</a>, for how to write an interactive declaration. </p>  <p>The rest of the elements are the <em>body</em> of the function: the Lisp code to do the work of the function (or, as a Lisp programmer would say, “a list of Lisp forms to evaluate”). The value returned by the function is the value returned by the last element of the body. </p><div class="_attribution">
