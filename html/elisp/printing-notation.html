 <h4 class="subsection">Printing Notation</h4>  <p>Many of the examples in this manual print text when they are evaluated. If you execute example code in a Lisp Interaction buffer (such as the buffer <samp>*scratch*</samp>) by typing <kbd>C-j</kbd> after the closing parenthesis of the example, the printed text is inserted into the buffer. If you execute the example by other means (such as by evaluating the function <code>eval-region</code>), the printed text is displayed in the echo area. </p> <p>Examples in this manual indicate printed text with ‘<samp>-|</samp>’, irrespective of where that text goes. The value returned by evaluating the form follows on a separate line with ‘<samp>⇒</samp>’. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(progn (prin1 'foo) (princ "\n") (prin1 'bar))
     -| foo
     -| bar
     ⇒ bar
</pre>
