 <h3 class="section">File Names</h3>  <p>Files are generally referred to by their names, in Emacs as elsewhere. File names in Emacs are represented as strings. The functions that operate on a file all expect a file name argument. </p> <p>In addition to operating on files themselves, Emacs Lisp programs often need to operate on file names; i.e., to take them apart and to use part of a name to construct related file names. This section describes how to manipulate file names. </p> <p>The functions in this section do not actually access files, so they can operate on file names that do not refer to an existing file or directory. </p>     <p>On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, these functions (like the function that actually operate on files) accept MS-DOS or MS-Windows file-name syntax, where backslashes separate the components, as well as POSIX syntax; but they always return POSIX syntax. This enables Lisp programs to specify file names in POSIX syntax and work properly on all systems without change.<a id="DOCF18" href="#FOOT18"><sup>18</sup></a> </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
