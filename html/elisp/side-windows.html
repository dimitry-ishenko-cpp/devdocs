 <h3 class="section">Side Windows</h3>    <p>Side windows are special windows positioned at any of the four sides of a frame’s root window (see <a href="windows-and-frames.html">Windows and Frames</a>). In practice, this means that the area of the frame’s root window is subdivided into a main window and a number of side windows surrounding that main window. The main window is either a “normal” live window or specifies the area containing all the normal windows. </p> <p>In their most simple form of use, side windows allow to display specific buffers always in the same area of a frame. Hence they can be regarded as a generalization of the concept provided by <code>display-buffer-at-bottom</code> (see <a href="buffer-display-action-functions.html">Buffer Display Action Functions</a>) to the remaining sides of a frame. With suitable customizations, however, side windows can be also used to provide frame layouts similar to those found in so-called integrated development environments (IDEs). </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
