 <h4 class="subsection">Kill Ring Concepts</h4> <p>The kill ring records killed text as strings in a list, most recent first. A short kill ring, for example, might look like this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">("some text" "a different piece of text" "even older text")
</pre>
</div> <p>When the list reaches <code>kill-ring-max</code> entries in length, adding a new entry automatically deletes the last entry. </p> <p>When kill commands are interwoven with other commands, each kill command makes a new entry in the kill ring. Multiple kill commands in succession build up a single kill ring entry, which would be yanked as a unit; the second and subsequent consecutive kill commands add text to the entry made by the first one. </p> <p>For yanking, one entry in the kill ring is designated the front of the ring. Some yank commands rotate the ring by designating a different element as the front. But this virtual rotation doesn’t change the list itself—the most recent entry always comes first in the list. </p><div class="_attribution">
