 <h4 class="subsection">Bool-Vector Type</h4> <p>A <em>bool-vector</em> is a one-dimensional array whose elements must be <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>. </p> <p>The printed representation of a bool-vector is like a string, except that it begins with ‘<samp>#&amp;</samp>’ followed by the length. The string constant that follows actually specifies the contents of the bool-vector as a bitmap—each character in the string contains 8 bits, which specify the next 8 elements of the bool-vector (1 stands for <code>t</code>, and 0 for <code>nil</code>). The least significant bits of the character correspond to the lowest indices in the bool-vector. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(make-bool-vector 3 t)
     ⇒ #&amp;3"^G"
(make-bool-vector 3 nil)
     ⇒ #&amp;3"^@"
</pre>
</div> <p>These results make sense, because the binary code for ‘<samp>C-g</samp>’ is 111 and ‘<samp>C-@</samp>’ is the character with code 0. </p> <p>If the length is not a multiple of 8, the printed representation shows extra elements, but these extras really make no difference. For instance, in the next example, the two bool-vectors are equal, because only the first 3 bits are used: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(equal #&amp;3"\377" #&amp;3"\007")
     ⇒ t
</pre>
