 <h4 class="subsection">Condition Variable Type</h4> <p>A <em>condition variable</em> is a device for a more complex thread synchronization than the one supported by a mutex. A thread can wait on a condition variable, to be woken up when some other thread notifies the condition. </p> <p>Condition variable objects have no read syntax. They print in hash notation, giving the name of the condition variable (if it has been given a name) or its address in core: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(make-condition-variable (make-mutex))
    â‡’ #&lt;condvar 01c45ae8&gt;
