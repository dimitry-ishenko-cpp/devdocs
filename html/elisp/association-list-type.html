 <h4 class="subsubsection">Association List Type</h4> <p>An <em>association list</em> or <em>alist</em> is a specially-constructed list whose elements are cons cells. In each element, the <small>CAR</small> is considered a <em>key</em>, and the <small>CDR</small> is considered an <em>associated value</em>. (In some cases, the associated value is stored in the <small>CAR</small> of the <small>CDR</small>.) Association lists are often used as stacks, since it is easy to add or remove associations at the front of the list. </p> <p>For example, </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(setq alist-of-colors
      '((rose . red) (lily . white) (buttercup . yellow)))
</pre>
</div> <p>sets the variable <code>alist-of-colors</code> to an alist of three elements. In the first element, <code>rose</code> is the key and <code>red</code> is the value. </p> <p>See <a href="association-lists.html">Association Lists</a>, for a further explanation of alists and for functions that work on alists. See <a href="hash-tables.html">Hash Tables</a>, for another kind of lookup table, which is much faster for handling a large number of keys. </p><div class="_attribution">
