 <h3 class="section">Inhibiting Interaction</h3> <p>It’s sometimes useful to be able to run Emacs as a headless server process that responds to commands given over a network connection. However, Emacs is primarily a platform for interactive usage, so many commands prompt the user for feedback in certain anomalous situations. This makes this use case more difficult, since the server process will just hang waiting for user input. </p>  <p>Binding the <code>inhibit-interaction</code> variable to something non-<code>nil</code> makes Emacs signal a <code>inhibited-interaction</code> error instead of prompting, which can then be used by the server process to handle these situations. </p> <p>Here’s a typical use case: </p> <div class="lisp"> <pre class="lisp">(let ((inhibit-interaction t))
  (respond-to-client
   (condition-case err
       (my-client-handling-function)
     (inhibited-interaction err))))
</pre>
</div> <p>If <code>my-client-handling-function</code> ends up calling something that asks the user for something (via <code>y-or-n-p</code> or <code>read-from-minibuffer</code> or the like), an <code>inhibited-interaction</code> error is signalled instead. The server code then catches that error and reports it to the client. </p><div class="_attribution">
