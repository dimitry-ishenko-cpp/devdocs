 <h4 class="subsection">Cons Cell and List Types</h4>    <p>A <em>cons cell</em> is an object that consists of two slots, called the <small>CAR</small> slot and the <small>CDR</small> slot. Each slot can <em>hold</em> any Lisp object. We also say that the <small>CAR</small> of this cons cell is whatever object its <small>CAR</small> slot currently holds, and likewise for the <small>CDR</small>. </p>  <p>A <em>list</em> is a series of cons cells, linked together so that the <small>CDR</small> slot of each cons cell holds either the next cons cell or the empty list. The empty list is actually the symbol <code>nil</code>. See <a href="lists.html">Lists</a>, for details. Because most cons cells are used as part of lists, we refer to any structure made out of cons cells as a <em>list structure</em>. </p>  <blockquote> <p>A note to C programmers: a Lisp list thus works as a <em>linked list</em> built up of cons cells. Because pointers in Lisp are implicit, we do not distinguish between a cons cell slot holding a value versus pointing to the value. </p>
</blockquote>  <p>Because cons cells are so central to Lisp, we also have a word for an object which is not a cons cell. These objects are called <em>atoms</em>. </p>   <p>The read syntax and printed representation for lists are identical, and consist of a left parenthesis, an arbitrary number of elements, and a right parenthesis. Here are examples of lists: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(A 2 "A")            ; <span class="roman">A list of three elements.</span>
()                   ; <span class="roman">A list of no elements (the empty list).</span>
nil                  ; <span class="roman">A list of no elements (the empty list).</span>
("A ()")             ; <span class="roman">A list of one element: the string <code>"A ()"</code>.</span>
(A ())               ; <span class="roman">A list of two elements: <code>A</code> and the empty list.</span>
(A nil)              ; <span class="roman">Equivalent to the previous.</span>
((A B C))            ; <span class="roman">A list of one element</span>
                     ;   <span class="roman">(which is a list of three elements).</span>
</pre>
</div> <p>Upon reading, each object inside the parentheses becomes an element of the list. That is, a cons cell is made for each element. The <small>CAR</small> slot of the cons cell holds the element, and its <small>CDR</small> slot refers to the next cons cell of the list, which holds the next element in the list. The <small>CDR</small> slot of the last cons cell is set to hold <code>nil</code>. </p> <p>The names <small>CAR</small> and <small>CDR</small> derive from the history of Lisp. The original Lisp implementation ran on an IBM 704 computer which divided words into two parts, the address and the decrement; <small>CAR</small> was an instruction to extract the contents of the address part of a register, and <small>CDR</small> an instruction to extract the contents of the decrement. By contrast, cons cells are named for the function <code>cons</code> that creates them, which in turn was named for its purpose, the construction of cells. </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
