 <h3 class="section">Caveats</h3>  <p>This manual has gone through numerous drafts. It is nearly complete but not flawless. There are a few topics that are not covered, either because we consider them secondary (such as most of the individual modes) or because they are yet to be written. Because we are not able to deal with them completely, we have left out several parts intentionally. </p> <p>The manual should be fully correct in what it does cover, and it is therefore open to criticism on anything it saysâ€”from specific examples and descriptive text, to the ordering of chapters and sections. If something is confusing, or you find that you have to look at the sources or experiment to learn something not covered in the manual, then perhaps the manual should be fixed. Please let us know. </p> <p>As you use this manual, we ask that you send corrections as soon as you find them. If you think of a simple, real life example for a function or group of functions, please make an effort to write it up and send it in. Please reference any comments to the node name and function or variable name, as appropriate. Also state the number of the edition you are criticizing. </p>   <p>Please send comments and corrections using <kbd>M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd>. If you wish to contribute new code (or send a patch to fix a problem), use <kbd>M-x submit-emacs-patch</kbd>. </p><div class="_attribution">
