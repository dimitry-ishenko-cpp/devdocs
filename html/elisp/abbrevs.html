 <h2 class="chapter">Abbrevs and Abbrev Expansion</h2>  <p>An abbreviation or <em>abbrev</em> is a string of characters that may be expanded to a longer string. The user can insert the abbrev string and find it replaced automatically with the expansion of the abbrev. This saves typing. </p> <p>The set of abbrevs currently in effect is recorded in an <em>abbrev table</em>. Each buffer has a local abbrev table, but normally all buffers in the same major mode share one abbrev table. There is also a global abbrev table. Normally both are used. </p> <p>An abbrev table is represented as an obarray. See <a href="creating-symbols.html">Creating Symbols</a>, for information about obarrays. Each abbreviation is represented by a symbol in the obarray. The symbol’s name is the abbreviation; its value is the expansion; its function definition is the hook function for performing the expansion (see <a href="defining-abbrevs.html">Defining Abbrevs</a>); and its property list cell contains various additional properties, including the use count and the number of times the abbreviation has been expanded (see <a href="abbrev-properties.html">Abbrev Properties</a>). </p>  <p>Certain abbrevs, called <em>system abbrevs</em>, are defined by a major mode instead of the user. A system abbrev is identified by its non-<code>nil</code> <code>:system</code> property (see <a href="abbrev-properties.html">Abbrev Properties</a>). When abbrevs are saved to an abbrev file, system abbrevs are omitted. See <a href="abbrev-files.html">Abbrev Files</a>. </p> <p>Because the symbols used for abbrevs are not interned in the usual obarray, they will never appear as the result of reading a Lisp expression; in fact, normally they are never used except by the code that handles abbrevs. Therefore, it is safe to use them in a nonstandard way. </p> <p>If the minor mode Abbrev mode is enabled, the buffer-local variable <code>abbrev-mode</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, and abbrevs are automatically expanded in the buffer. For the user-level commands for abbrevs, see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Abbrevs.html#Abbrevs">Abbrev Mode</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>. </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
