 <h4 class="subsection">Syntax of Regular Expressions</h4>   <p>Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are special constructs and the rest are <em>ordinary</em>. An ordinary character is a simple regular expression that matches that character and nothing else. The special characters are ‘<samp>.</samp>’, ‘<samp>*</samp>’, ‘<samp>+</samp>’, ‘<samp>?</samp>’, ‘<samp>[</samp>’, ‘<samp>^</samp>’, ‘<samp>$</samp>’, and ‘<samp>\</samp>’; no new special characters will be defined in the future. The character ‘<samp>]</samp>’ is special if it ends a character alternative (see later). The character ‘<samp>-</samp>’ is special inside a character alternative. A ‘<samp>[:</samp>’ and balancing ‘<samp>:]</samp>’ enclose a character class inside a character alternative. Any other character appearing in a regular expression is ordinary, unless a ‘<samp>\</samp>’ precedes it. </p> <p>For example, ‘<samp>f</samp>’ is not a special character, so it is ordinary, and therefore ‘<samp>f</samp>’ is a regular expression that matches the string ‘<samp>f</samp>’ and no other string. (It does <em>not</em> match the string ‘<samp>fg</samp>’, but it does match a <em>part</em> of that string.) Likewise, ‘<samp>o</samp>’ is a regular expression that matches only ‘<samp>o</samp>’. </p> <p>Any two regular expressions <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> can be concatenated. The result is a regular expression that matches a string if <var>a</var> matches some amount of the beginning of that string and <var>b</var> matches the rest of the string. </p> <p>As a simple example, we can concatenate the regular expressions ‘<samp>f</samp>’ and ‘<samp>o</samp>’ to get the regular expression ‘<samp>fo</samp>’, which matches only the string ‘<samp>fo</samp>’. Still trivial. To do something more powerful, you need to use one of the special regular expression constructs. </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
