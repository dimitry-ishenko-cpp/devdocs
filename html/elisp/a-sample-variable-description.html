 <h4 class="subsubsection">A Sample Variable Description</h4>   <p>A <em>variable</em> is a name that can be <em>bound</em> (or <em>set</em>) to an object. The object to which a variable is bound is called a <em>value</em>; we say also that variable holds that value. Although nearly all variables can be set by the user, certain variables exist specifically so that users can change them; these are called <em>user options</em>. Ordinary variables and user options are described using a format like that for functions, except that there are no arguments. </p> <p>Here is a description of the imaginary <code>electric-future-map</code> variable. </p> <dl> <dt id="electric-future-map">Variable: <strong>electric-future-map</strong>
</dt> <dd><p>The value of this variable is a full keymap used by Electric Command Future mode. The functions in this map allow you to edit commands you have not yet thought about executing. </p></dd>
</dl> <p>User option descriptions have the same format, but ‘<samp>Variable</samp>’ is replaced by ‘<samp>User Option</samp>’. </p><div class="_attribution">
