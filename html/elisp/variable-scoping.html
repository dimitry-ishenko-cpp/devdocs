 <h3 class="section">Scoping Rules for Variable Bindings</h3>  <p>When you create a local binding for a variable, that binding takes effect only within a limited portion of the program (see <a href="local-variables.html">Local Variables</a>). This section describes exactly what this means. </p>   <p>Each local binding has a certain <em>scope</em> and <em>extent</em>. <em>Scope</em> refers to <em>where</em> in the textual source code the binding can be accessed. <em>Extent</em> refers to <em>when</em>, as the program is executing, the binding exists. </p>    <p>By default, the local bindings that Emacs creates are <em>dynamic bindings</em>. Such a binding has <em>dynamic scope</em>, meaning that any part of the program can potentially access the variable binding. It also has <em>dynamic extent</em>, meaning that the binding lasts only while the binding construct (such as the body of a <code>let</code> form) is being executed. </p>    <p>Emacs can optionally create <em>lexical bindings</em>. A lexical binding has <em>lexical scope</em>, meaning that any reference to the variable must be located textually within the binding construct<a id="DOCF10" href="#FOOT10"><sup>10</sup></a>. It also has <em>indefinite extent</em>, meaning that under some circumstances the binding can live on even after the binding construct has finished executing, by means of special objects called <em>closures</em>. </p> <p>The following subsections describe dynamic binding and lexical binding in greater detail, and how to enable lexical binding in Emacs Lisp programs. </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
