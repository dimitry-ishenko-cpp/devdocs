 <h2 class="chapter">Control Structures</h2>    <p>A Lisp program consists of a set of <em>expressions</em>, or <em>forms</em> (see <a href="forms.html">Forms</a>). We control the order of execution of these forms by enclosing them in <em>control structures</em>. Control structures are special forms which control when, whether, or how many times to execute the forms they contain. </p>  <p>The simplest order of execution is sequential execution: first form <var>a</var>, then form <var>b</var>, and so on. This is what happens when you write several forms in succession in the body of a function, or at top level in a file of Lisp code—the forms are executed in the order written. We call this <em>textual order</em>. For example, if a function body consists of two forms <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>, evaluation of the function evaluates first <var>a</var> and then <var>b</var>. The result of evaluating <var>b</var> becomes the value of the function. </p> <p>Explicit control structures make possible an order of execution other than sequential. </p> <p>Emacs Lisp provides several kinds of control structure, including other varieties of sequencing, conditionals, iteration, and (controlled) jumps—all discussed below. The built-in control structures are special forms since their subforms are not necessarily evaluated or not evaluated sequentially. You can use macros to define your own control structure constructs (see <a href="macros.html">Macros</a>). </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
