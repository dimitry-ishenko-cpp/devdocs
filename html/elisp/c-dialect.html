 <h3 class="section"> C Dialect</h3>  <p>The C part of Emacs is portable to C99 or later: C11-specific features such as ‘<samp>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</samp>’ and ‘<samp>_Noreturn</samp>’ are not used without a check, typically at configuration time, and the Emacs build procedure provides a substitute implementation if necessary. Some C11 features, such as anonymous structures and unions, are too difficult to emulate, so they are avoided entirely. </p> <p>At some point in the future the base C dialect will no doubt change to C11. </p><div class="_attribution">
