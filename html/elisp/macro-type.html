 <h4 class="subsection">Macro Type</h4> <p>A <em>Lisp macro</em> is a user-defined construct that extends the Lisp language. It is represented as an object much like a function, but with different argument-passing semantics. A Lisp macro has the form of a list whose first element is the symbol <code>macro</code> and whose <small>CDR</small> is a Lisp function object, including the <code>lambda</code> symbol. </p> <p>Lisp macro objects are usually defined with the built-in <code>defmacro</code> macro, but any list that begins with <code>macro</code> is a macro as far as Emacs is concerned. See <a href="macros.html">Macros</a>, for an explanation of how to write a macro. </p> <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Lisp macros and keyboard macros (see <a href="keyboard-macros.html">Keyboard Macros</a>) are entirely different things. When we use the word “macro” without qualification, we mean a Lisp macro, not a keyboard macro. </p><div class="_attribution">
