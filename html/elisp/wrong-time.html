 <h4 class="subsection">Wrong Time</h4> <p>The most common problem in writing macros is doing some of the real work prematurelyâ€”while expanding the macro, rather than in the expansion itself. For instance, one real package had this macro definition: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(defmacro my-set-buffer-multibyte (arg)
  (if (fboundp 'set-buffer-multibyte)
      (set-buffer-multibyte arg)))
</pre>
</div> <p>With this erroneous macro definition, the program worked fine when interpreted but failed when compiled. This macro definition called <code>set-buffer-multibyte</code> during compilation, which was wrong, and then did nothing when the compiled package was run. The definition that the programmer really wanted was this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(defmacro my-set-buffer-multibyte (arg)
  (if (fboundp 'set-buffer-multibyte)
      `(set-buffer-multibyte ,arg)))
</pre>
</div> <p>This macro expands, if appropriate, into a call to <code>set-buffer-multibyte</code> that will be executed when the compiled program is actually run. </p><div class="_attribution">
