 <h4 class="subsubsection">Font Lock Multiline</h4> <p>One way to ensure reliable rehighlighting of multiline Font Lock constructs is to put on them the text property <code>font-lock-multiline</code>. It should be present and non-<code>nil</code> for text that is part of a multiline construct. </p> <p>When Font Lock is about to highlight a range of text, it first extends the boundaries of the range as necessary so that they do not fall within text marked with the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property. Then it removes any <code>font-lock-multiline</code> properties from the range, and highlights it. The highlighting specification (mostly <code>font-lock-keywords</code>) must reinstall this property each time, whenever it is appropriate. </p> <p><strong>Warning:</strong> donâ€™t use the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property on large ranges of text, because that will make rehighlighting slow. </p> <dl> <dt id="font-lock-multiline">Variable: <strong>font-lock-multiline</strong>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> variable is set to <code>t</code>, Font Lock will try to add the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property automatically on multiline constructs. This is not a universal solution, however, since it slows down Font Lock somewhat. It can miss some multiline constructs, or make the property larger or smaller than necessary. </p> <p>For elements whose <var>matcher</var> is a function, the function should ensure that submatch 0 covers the whole relevant multiline construct, even if only a small subpart will be highlighted. It is often just as easy to add the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property by hand. </p>
</dd>
</dl> <p>The <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property is meant to ensure proper refontification; it does not automatically identify new multiline constructs. Identifying them requires that Font Lock mode operate on large enough chunks at a time. This will happen by accident on many cases, which may give the impression that multiline constructs magically work. If you set the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> variable non-<code>nil</code>, this impression will be even stronger, since the highlighting of those constructs which are found will be properly updated from then on. But that does not work reliably. </p> <p>To find multiline constructs reliably, you must either manually place the <code>font-lock-multiline</code> property on the text before Font Lock mode looks at it, or use <code>font-lock-fontify-region-function</code>. </p><div class="_attribution">
