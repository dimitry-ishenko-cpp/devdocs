 <h3 class="section">Vectors</h3>  <p>A <em>vector</em> is a general-purpose array whose elements can be any Lisp objects. (By contrast, the elements of a string can only be characters. See <a href="strings-and-characters.html">Strings and Characters</a>.) Vectors are used in Emacs for many purposes: as key sequences (see <a href="key-sequences.html">Key Sequences</a>), as symbol-lookup tables (see <a href="creating-symbols.html">Creating Symbols</a>), as part of the representation of a byte-compiled function (see <a href="byte-compilation.html">Byte Compilation</a>), and more. </p> <p>Like other arrays, vectors use zero-origin indexing: the first element has index 0. </p> <p>Vectors are printed with square brackets surrounding the elements. Thus, a vector whose elements are the symbols <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>a</code> is printed as <code>[a b a]</code>. You can write vectors in the same way in Lisp input. </p> <p>A vector, like a string or a number, is considered a constant for evaluation: the result of evaluating it is the same vector. This does not evaluate or even examine the elements of the vector. See <a href="self_002devaluating-forms.html">Self-Evaluating Forms</a>. Vectors written with square brackets should not be modified via <code>aset</code> or other destructive operations. See <a href="mutability.html">Mutability</a>. </p> <p>Here are examples illustrating these principles: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(setq avector [1 two '(three) "four" [five]])
     ⇒ [1 two '(three) "four" [five]]
(eval avector)
     ⇒ [1 two '(three) "four" [five]]
(eq avector (eval avector))
     ⇒ t
</pre>
