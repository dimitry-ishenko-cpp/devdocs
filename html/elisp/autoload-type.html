 <h4 class="subsection">Autoload Type</h4> <p>An <em>autoload object</em> is a list whose first element is the symbol <code>autoload</code>. It is stored as the function definition of a symbol, where it serves as a placeholder for the real definition. The autoload object says that the real definition is found in a file of Lisp code that should be loaded when necessary. It contains the name of the file, plus some other information about the real definition. </p> <p>After the file has been loaded, the symbol should have a new function definition that is not an autoload object. The new definition is then called as if it had been there to begin with. From the userâ€™s point of view, the function call works as expected, using the function definition in the loaded file. </p> <p>An autoload object is usually created with the function <code>autoload</code>, which stores the object in the function cell of a symbol. See <a href="autoload.html">Autoload</a>, for more details. </p><div class="_attribution">
