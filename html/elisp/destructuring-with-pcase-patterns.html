 <h4 class="subsection">Destructuring with pcase Patterns</h4>  <p>Pcase patterns not only express a condition on the form of the objects they can match, but they can also extract sub-fields of those objects. For example we can extract 2 elements from a list that is the value of the variable <code>my-list</code> with the following code: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">  (pcase my-list
    (`(add ,x ,y)  (message "Contains %S and %S" x y)))
</pre>
</div> <p>This will not only extract <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> but will additionally test that <code>my-list</code> is a list containing exactly 3 elements and whose first element is the symbol <code>add</code>. If any of those tests fail, <code>pcase</code> will immediately return <code>nil</code> without calling <code>message</code>. </p> <p>Extraction of multiple values stored in an object is known as <em>destructuring</em>. Using <code>pcase</code> patterns allows to perform <em>destructuring binding</em>, which is similar to a local binding (see <a href="local-variables.html">Local Variables</a>), but gives values to multiple elements of a variable by extracting those values from an object of compatible structure. </p> <p>The macros described in this section use <code>pcase</code> patterns to perform destructuring binding. The condition of the object to be of compatible structure means that the object must match the pattern, because only then the object’s subfields can be extracted. For example: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">  (pcase-let ((`(add ,x ,y) my-list))
    (message "Contains %S and %S" x y))
</pre>
</div> <p>does the same as the previous example, except that it directly tries to extract <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> from <code>my-list</code> without first verifying if <code>my-list</code> is a list which has the right number of elements and has <code>add</code> as its first element. The precise behavior when the object does not actually match the pattern is undefined, although the body will not be silently skipped: either an error is signaled or the body is run with some of the variables potentially bound to arbitrary values like <code>nil</code>. </p> <p>The pcase patterns that are useful for destructuring bindings are generally those described in <a href="backquote-patterns.html">Backquote Patterns</a>, since they express a specification of the structure of objects that will match. </p> <p>For an alternative facility for destructuring binding, see <a href="sequence-functions.html#seq_002dlet">seq-let</a>. </p> <dl> <dt id="pcase-let">Macro: <strong>pcase-let</strong> <em>bindings body…</em>
