 <h4 class="subsection">Echo Area Customization</h4>  <p>These variables control details of how the echo area works. </p> <dl> <dt id="cursor-in-echo-area">Variable: <strong>cursor-in-echo-area</strong>
</dt> <dd>
<p>This variable controls where the cursor appears when a message is displayed in the echo area. If it is non-<code>nil</code>, then the cursor appears at the end of the message. Otherwise, the cursor appears at point—not in the echo area at all. </p> <p>The value is normally <code>nil</code>; Lisp programs bind it to <code>t</code> for brief periods of time. </p>
</dd>
</dl> <dl> <dt id="echo-area-clear-hook">Variable: <strong>echo-area-clear-hook</strong>
</dt> <dd><p>This normal hook is run whenever the echo area is cleared—either by <code>(message nil)</code> or for any other reason. </p></dd>
</dl> <dl> <dt id="echo-keystrokes">User Option: <strong>echo-keystrokes</strong>
</dt> <dd>
<p>This variable determines how much time should elapse before command characters echo. Its value must be a number, and specifies the number of seconds to wait before echoing. If the user types a prefix key (such as <kbd>C-x</kbd>) and then delays this many seconds before continuing, the prefix key is echoed in the echo area. (Once echoing begins in a key sequence, all subsequent characters in the same key sequence are echoed immediately.) </p> <p>If the value is zero, then command input is not echoed. </p>
</dd>
</dl> <dl> <dt id="message-truncate-lines">Variable: <strong>message-truncate-lines</strong>
</dt> <dd><p>Normally, displaying a long message resizes the echo area to display the entire message, wrapping long line as needed. But if the variable <code>message-truncate-lines</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, long lines of echo-area message are instead truncated to fit the mini-window width. </p></dd>
</dl> <p>The variable <code>max-mini-window-height</code>, which specifies the maximum height for resizing minibuffer windows, also applies to the echo area (which is really a special use of the minibuffer window; see <a href="minibuffer-windows.html">Minibuffer Windows</a>). </p><div class="_attribution">
