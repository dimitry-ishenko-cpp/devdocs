 <h4 class="subsection">Stream Type</h4> <p>A <em>stream</em> is an object that can be used as a source or sink for charactersâ€”either to supply characters for input or to accept them as output. Many different types can be used this way: markers, buffers, strings, and functions. Most often, input streams (character sources) obtain characters from the keyboard, a buffer, or a file, and output streams (character sinks) send characters to a buffer, such as a <samp>*Help*</samp> buffer, or to the echo area. </p> <p>The object <code>nil</code>, in addition to its other meanings, may be used as a stream. It stands for the value of the variable <code>standard-input</code> or <code>standard-output</code>. Also, the object <code>t</code> as a stream specifies input using the minibuffer (see <a href="minibuffers.html">Minibuffers</a>) or output in the echo area (see <a href="the-echo-area.html">The Echo Area</a>). </p> <p>Streams have no special printed representation or read syntax, and print as whatever primitive type they are. </p> <p>See <a href="read-and-print.html">Read and Print</a>, for a description of functions related to streams, including parsing and printing functions. </p><div class="_attribution">
