 <h3 class="section">Buffer-Local Variables</h3>   <p>Global and local variable bindings are found in most programming languages in one form or another. Emacs, however, also supports additional, unusual kinds of variable binding, such as <em>buffer-local</em> bindings, which apply only in one buffer. Having different values for a variable in different buffers is an important customization method. (Variables can also have bindings that are local to each terminal. See <a href="multiple-terminals.html">Multiple Terminals</a>.) </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
