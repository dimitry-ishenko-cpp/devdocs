 <h4 class="subsection">Vector Type</h4> <p>A <em>vector</em> is a one-dimensional array of elements of any type. It takes a constant amount of time to access any element of a vector. (In a list, the access time of an element is proportional to the distance of the element from the beginning of the list.) </p> <p>The printed representation of a vector consists of a left square bracket, the elements, and a right square bracket. This is also the read syntax. Like numbers and strings, vectors are considered constants for evaluation. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">[1 "two" (three)]      ; <span class="roman">A vector of three elements.</span>
     â‡’ [1 "two" (three)]
</pre>
