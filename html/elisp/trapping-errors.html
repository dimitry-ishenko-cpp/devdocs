 <h4 class="subsection">Trapping Errors</h4> <p>Emacs normally displays an error message when an error is signaled and not handled with <code>condition-case</code>. While Edebug is active and executing instrumented code, it normally responds to all unhandled errors. You can customize this with the options <code>edebug-on-error</code> and <code>edebug-on-quit</code>; see <a href="edebug-options.html">Edebug Options</a>. </p> <p>When Edebug responds to an error, it shows the last stop point encountered before the error. This may be the location of a call to a function which was not instrumented, and within which the error actually occurred. For an unbound variable error, the last known stop point might be quite distant from the offending variable reference. In that case, you might want to display a full backtrace (see <a href="edebug-misc.html">Edebug Misc</a>). </p> <p>If you change <code>debug-on-error</code> or <code>debug-on-quit</code> while Edebug is active, these changes will be forgotten when Edebug becomes inactive. Furthermore, during Edebugâ€™s recursive edit, these variables are bound to the values they had outside of Edebug. </p><div class="_attribution">
