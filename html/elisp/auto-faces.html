 <h4 class="subsection">Automatic Face Assignment</h4>   <p>This hook is used for automatically assigning faces to text in the buffer. It is part of the implementation of Jit-Lock mode, used by Font-Lock. </p> <dl> <dt id="fontification-functions">Variable: <strong>fontification-functions</strong>
</dt> <dd>
<p>This variable holds a list of functions that are called by Emacs redisplay as needed, just before doing redisplay. They are called even when Font Lock Mode isnâ€™t enabled. When Font Lock Mode is enabled, this variable usually holds just one function, <code>jit-lock-function</code>. </p> <p>The functions are called in the order listed, with one argument, a buffer position <var>pos</var>. Collectively they should attempt to assign faces to the text in the current buffer starting at <var>pos</var>. </p> <p>The functions should record the faces they assign by setting the <code>face</code> property. They should also add a non-<code>nil</code> <code>fontified</code> property to all the text they have assigned faces to. That property tells redisplay that faces have been assigned to that text already. </p> <p>It is probably a good idea for the functions to do nothing if the character after <var>pos</var> already has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>fontified</code> property, but this is not required. If one function overrides the assignments made by a previous one, the properties after the last function finishes are the ones that really matter. </p> <p>For efficiency, we recommend writing these functions so that they usually assign faces to around 400 to 600 characters at each call. </p>
