 <h4 class="subsection">Internals of the Kill Ring</h4> <p>The variable <code>kill-ring</code> holds the kill ring contents, in the form of a list of strings. The most recent kill is always at the front of the list. </p> <p>The <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> variable points to a link in the kill ring list, whose <small>CAR</small> is the text to yank next. We say it identifies the front of the ring. Moving <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> to a different link is called <em>rotating the kill ring</em>. We call the kill ring a “ring” because the functions that move the yank pointer wrap around from the end of the list to the beginning, or vice-versa. Rotation of the kill ring is virtual; it does not change the value of <code>kill-ring</code>. </p> <p>Both <code>kill-ring</code> and <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> are Lisp variables whose values are normally lists. The word “pointer” in the name of the <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> indicates that the variable’s purpose is to identify one element of the list for use by the next yank command. </p> <p>The value of <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is always <code>eq</code> to one of the links in the kill ring list. The element it identifies is the <small>CAR</small> of that link. Kill commands, which change the kill ring, also set this variable to the value of <code>kill-ring</code>. The effect is to rotate the ring so that the newly killed text is at the front. </p> <p>Here is a diagram that shows the variable <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> pointing to the second entry in the kill ring <code>("some text" "a
different piece of text" "yet older text")</code>. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">kill-ring                  ---- kill-ring-yank-pointer
