 <h4 class="subsection">Accepting Output from Processes</h4>  <p>Output from asynchronous subprocesses normally arrives only while Emacs is waiting for some sort of external event, such as elapsed time or terminal input. Occasionally it is useful in a Lisp program to explicitly permit output to arrive at a specific point, or even to wait until output arrives from a process. </p> <dl> <dt id="accept-process-output">Function: <strong>accept-process-output</strong> <em>&amp;optional process seconds millisec just-this-one</em>
</dt> <dd>
<p>This function allows Emacs to read pending output from processes. The output is given to their filter functions. If <var>process</var> is non-<code>nil</code> then this function does not return until some output has been received from <var>process</var> or <var>process</var> has closed the connection. </p> <p>The arguments <var>seconds</var> and <var>millisec</var> let you specify timeout periods. The former specifies a period measured in seconds and the latter specifies one measured in milliseconds. The two time periods thus specified are added together, and <code>accept-process-output</code> returns after that much time, even if there is no subprocess output. </p> <p>The argument <var>millisec</var> is obsolete (and should not be used), because <var>seconds</var> can be floating point to specify waiting a fractional number of seconds. If <var>seconds</var> is 0, the function accepts whatever output is pending but does not wait. </p> <p>If <var>process</var> is a process, and the argument <var>just-this-one</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, only output from that process is handled, suspending output from other processes until some output has been received from that process or the timeout expires. If <var>just-this-one</var> is an integer, also inhibit running timers. This feature is generally not recommended, but may be necessary for specific applications, such as speech synthesis. </p> <p>The function <code>accept-process-output</code> returns non-<code>nil</code> if it got output from <var>process</var>, or from any process if <var>process</var> is <code>nil</code>; this can occur even after a process has exited if the corresponding connection contains buffered data. The function returns <code>nil</code> if the timeout expired or the connection was closed before output arrived. </p>
</dd>
</dl> <p>If a connection from a process contains buffered data, <code>accept-process-output</code> can return non-<code>nil</code> even after the process has exited. Therefore, although the following loop: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">;; This loop contains a bug.
(while (process-live-p process)
  (accept-process-output process))
</pre>
</div> <p>will often read all output from <var>process</var>, it has a race condition and can miss some output if <code>process-live-p</code> returns <code>nil</code> while the connection still contains data. Better is to write the loop like this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(while (accept-process-output process))
</pre>
</div> <p>If you have passed a non-<code>nil</code> <var>stderr</var> to <code>make-process</code>, it will have a standard error process. See <a href="asynchronous-processes.html">Asynchronous Processes</a>. In that case, waiting for process output from the main process doesnâ€™t wait for output from the standard error process. To make sure you have received both all of standard output and all of standard error from a process, use the following code: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(while (accept-process-output process))
(while (accept-process-output stderr-process))
</pre>
</div> <p>If you passed a buffer to the <var>stderr</var> argument of <code>make-process</code>, you still have to wait for the standard error process, like so: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">(let* ((stdout (generate-new-buffer "stdout"))
       (stderr (generate-new-buffer "stderr"))
       (process (make-process :name "test"
                              :command '("my-program")
                              :buffer stdout
                              :stderr stderr))
       (stderr-process (get-buffer-process stderr)))
  (unless (and process stderr-process)
    (error "Process unexpectedly nil"))
  (while (accept-process-output process))
  (while (accept-process-output stderr-process)))
</pre>
</div> <p>Only when both <code>accept-process-output</code> forms return <code>nil</code>, you can be sure that the process has exited and Emacs has read all its output. </p> <p>Reading pending standard error from a process running on a remote host is not possible this way. </p><div class="_attribution">
