 <h2 class="chapter">Hash Tables</h2>   <p>A hash table is a very fast kind of lookup table, somewhat like an alist (see <a href="association-lists.html">Association Lists</a>) in that it maps keys to corresponding values. It differs from an alist in these ways: </p> <ul> <li> Lookup in a hash table is extremely fast for large tables—in fact, the time required is essentially <em>independent</em> of how many elements are stored in the table. For smaller tables (a few tens of elements) alists may still be faster because hash tables have a more-or-less constant overhead. </li>
<li> The correspondences in a hash table are in no particular order. </li>
<li> There is no way to share structure between two hash tables, the way two alists can share a common tail. </li>
</ul> <p>Emacs Lisp provides a general-purpose hash table data type, along with a series of functions for operating on them. Hash tables have a special printed representation, which consists of ‘<samp>#s</samp>’ followed by a list specifying the hash table properties and contents. See <a href="creating-hash.html">Creating Hash</a>. (Hash notation, the initial ‘<samp>#</samp>’ character used in the printed representations of objects with no read representation, has nothing to do with hash tables. See <a href="printed-representation.html">Printed Representation</a>.) </p> <p>Obarrays are also a kind of hash table, but they are a different type of object and are used only for recording interned symbols (see <a href="creating-symbols.html">Creating Symbols</a>). </p> <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>
