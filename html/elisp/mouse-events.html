 <h4 class="subsection">Mouse Events</h4> <p>Emacs supports four kinds of mouse events: click events, drag events, button-down events, and motion events. All mouse events are represented as lists. The <small>CAR</small> of the list is the event type; this says which mouse button was involved, and which modifier keys were used with it. The event type can also distinguish double or triple button presses (see <a href="repeat-events.html">Repeat Events</a>). The rest of the list elements give position and time information. </p> <p>For key lookup, only the event type matters: two events of the same type necessarily run the same command. The command can access the full values of these events using the ‘<samp>e</samp>’ interactive code. See <a href="interactive-codes.html">Interactive Codes</a>. </p> <p>A key sequence that starts with a mouse event is read using the keymaps of the buffer in the window that the mouse was in, not the current buffer. This does not imply that clicking in a window selects that window or its buffer—that is entirely under the control of the command binding of the key sequence. </p><div class="_attribution">
