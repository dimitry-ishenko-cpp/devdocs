 <h4 class="subsection">Classification of List Forms</h4>   <p>A form that is a nonempty list is either a function call, a macro call, or a special form, according to its first element. These three kinds of forms are evaluated in different ways, described below. The remaining list elements constitute the <em>arguments</em> for the function, macro, or special form. </p> <p>The first step in evaluating a nonempty list is to examine its first element. This element alone determines what kind of form the list is and how the rest of the list is to be processed. The first element is <em>not</em> evaluated, as it would be in some Lisp dialects such as Scheme. </p><div class="_attribution">
