 <h3 class="section">Datagrams</h3>  <p>A <em>datagram</em> connection communicates with individual packets rather than streams of data. Each call to <code>process-send</code> sends one datagram packet (see <a href="input-to-processes.html">Input to Processes</a>), and each datagram received results in one call to the filter function. </p> <p>The datagram connection doesnâ€™t have to talk with the same remote peer all the time. It has a <em>remote peer address</em> which specifies where to send datagrams to. Each time an incoming datagram is passed to the filter function, the peer address is set to the address that datagram came from; that way, if the filter function sends a datagram, it will go back to that place. You can specify the remote peer address when you create the datagram connection using the <code>:remote</code> keyword. You can change it later on by calling <code>set-process-datagram-address</code>. </p> <dl> <dt id="process-datagram-address">Function: <strong>process-datagram-address</strong> <em>process</em>
