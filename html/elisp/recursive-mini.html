 <h3 class="section">Recursive Minibuffers</h3>  <p>These functions and variables deal with recursive minibuffers (see <a href="recursive-editing.html">Recursive Editing</a>): </p> <dl> <dt id="minibuffer-depth">Function: <strong>minibuffer-depth</strong>
</dt> <dd><p>This function returns the current depth of activations of the minibuffer, a nonnegative integer. If no minibuffers are active, it returns zero. </p></dd>
</dl> <dl> <dt id="enable-recursive-minibuffers">User Option: <strong>enable-recursive-minibuffers</strong>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, you can invoke commands (such as <code>find-file</code>) that use minibuffers even while the minibuffer is active. Such invocation produces a recursive editing level for a new minibuffer. By default, the outer-level minibuffer is invisible while you are editing the inner one. If you have <code>minibuffer-follows-selected-frame</code> set to <code>nil</code>, you can have minibuffers visible on several frames at the same time. See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Minibuffer.html#Basic-Minibuffer">(emacs)Basic Minibuffer</a>. </p> <p>If this variable is <code>nil</code>, you cannot invoke minibuffer commands when the minibuffer is active, not even if you switch to another window to do it. </p>
</dd>
</dl> <p>If a command name has a property <code>enable-recursive-minibuffers</code> that is non-<code>nil</code>, then the command can use the minibuffer to read arguments even if it is invoked from the minibuffer. A command can also achieve this by binding <code>enable-recursive-minibuffers</code> to <code>t</code> in the interactive declaration (see <a href="using-interactive.html">Using Interactive</a>). The minibuffer command <code>next-matching-history-element</code> (normally <kbd>M-s</kbd> in the minibuffer) does the latter. </p><div class="_attribution">
