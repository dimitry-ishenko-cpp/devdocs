 <h4 class="subsection">Buffer Text Notation</h4>  <p>Some examples describe modifications to the contents of a buffer, by showing the before and after versions of the text. These examples show the contents of the buffer in question between two lines of dashes containing the buffer name. In addition, ‘<samp>∗</samp>’ indicates the location of point. (The symbol for point, of course, is not part of the text in the buffer; it indicates the place <em>between</em> two characters where point is currently located.) </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">---------- Buffer: foo ----------
This is the ∗contents of foo.
---------- Buffer: foo ----------

(insert "changed ")
     ⇒ nil
---------- Buffer: foo ----------
This is the changed ∗contents of foo.
---------- Buffer: foo ----------
</pre>
