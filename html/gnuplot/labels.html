<h1 id="SECTION030190000000000000000">Labels</h1>  The <b>labels</b> style reads coordinates and text from a data file and places the text string at the corresponding 2D or 3D position. 3 or 4 input columns of basic data are required. Additional input columns may be used to provide properties that vary point by point such as text rotation angle (keywords <b>rotate variable</b>) or color (see <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles.html#textcolor_variable">textcolor variable</a></b>). <pre>
3 columns:  x  y  string    # 2D version
4 columns:  x  y  z  string # 3D version</pre>  <p> The font, color, rotation angle and other properties of the printed text may be specified as additional command options (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_label">set label</a></b>). The example below generates a 2D plot with text labels constructed from the city whose name is taken from column 1 of the input file, and whose geographic coordinates are in columns 4 and 5. The font size is calculated from the value in column 3, in this case the population. </p>
<pre>
CityName(String,Size) = sprintf("{/=%d %s}", Scale(Size), String)
plot 'cities.dat' using 5:4:(CityName(stringcolumn(1),$3)) with labels</pre>  <p> If we did not want to adjust the font size to a different size for each city name, the command would be much simpler: </p>
<pre>
plot 'cities.dat' using 5:4:1 with labels font "Times,8"</pre>  <p> If the labels are marked as <b>hypertext</b> then the text only appears if the mouse is hovering over the corresponding anchor point. See <b><a href="set_show.html#hypertext">hypertext</a></b>. In this case you must enable the label's <b>point</b> attribute so that there is a point to act as the hypertext anchor: </p>
<pre>
plot 'cities.dat' using 5:4:1 with labels hypertext point pt 7</pre>  <p> The <b>labels</b> style can also be used in place of the <b>points</b> style when the set of predefined point symbols is not suitable or not sufficiently flexible. For example, here we define a set of chosen single-character symbols and assign one of them to each point in a plot based on the value in data column 3: </p>
<pre>
set encoding utf8
symbol(z) = "∙□+⊙♠♣♡♢"[int(z):int(z)]
splot 'file' using 1:2:(symbol($3)) with labels</pre>  <p> This example shows use of labels with variable rotation angle in column 4 and textcolor (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>tc<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>) in column 5. Note that variable color is always taken from the last column in the <b>using</b> specifier. </p>
