splot DATA {using x:y:z} with polygons
      {fillstyle &lt;fillstyle spec&gt;}
      {fillcolor &lt;colorspec&gt;}</pre>  <b>splot with polygons</b> uses pm3d to render individual triangles, quadrangles, and larger polygons in 3D. These may be facets of a 3D surface or isolated shapes. The code assumes that the vertices lie in a plane. Vertices defining individual polygons are read from successive records of the input file. A blank line separates one polygon from the next. <p> The fill style and color may be specified in the splot command, otherwise the global fillstyle from <b>set style fill</b> is used. Due to limitations in the pm3d code, a single border line style from <b>set pm3d border</b> is applied to all polygons. This restriction may be removed in a later gnuplot version. </p>
<p> pm3d sort order and lighting are applied to the faces. It is probably always desirable to use <b>set pm3d depthsort</b>. </p>
