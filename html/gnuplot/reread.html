<h1 id="SECTION040260000000000000000">Reread</h1>  [DEPRECATED in version 5.4] <p> This command is deprecated in favor of explicit iteration. See <b><a href="iteration.html#iterate">iterate</a></b>. The <b>reread</b> command causes the current <b>gnuplot</b> command file, as specified by a <b>load</b> command, to be reset to its starting point before further commands are read from it. This essentially implements an endless loop of the commands from the beginning of the command file to the <b>reread</b> command. The <b>reread</b> command has no effect when reading interactively (from stdin). </p><div class="_attribution">
