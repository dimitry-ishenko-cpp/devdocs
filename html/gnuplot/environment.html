<h1 id="SECTION020150000000000000000">Environment</h1>  A number of shell environment variables are understood by <b>gnuplot</b>. None of these are required, but may be useful. <p> GNUTERM, if defined, is used to set the terminal type on start-up. Starting with version 5.2 the entire string in GNUTERM is passed to <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>set term<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> so that terminal options may be included. E.g.  </p>
<pre>
GNUTERM="postscript eps color size 5in, 3in"</pre>  This can be overridden by the ˜ /.gnuplot (or equivalent) start-up file (see <b><a href="start_up_initialization.html#startup">startup</a></b>) and of course by later explicit <b>set term</b> commands. <p> GNUHELP may be defined to be the pathname of the HELP file (gnuplot.gih). </p>
<p> On VMS, the logical name GNUPLOT$HELP should be defined as the name of the help library for <b>gnuplot</b>. The <b>gnuplot</b> help can be put inside any VMS system help library. </p>
<p> On Unix, HOME is used as the name of a directory to search for a .gnuplot file if none is found in the current directory. On MS-DOS, Windows and OS/2, GNUPLOT is used. On Windows, the NT-specific variable USERPROFILE is also tried. VMS, SYS$LOGIN: is used. Type <b>help startup</b>. </p>
<p> On Unix, PAGER is used as an output filter for help messages. </p>
<p> On Unix, SHELL is used for the <b>shell</b> command. On MS-DOS and OS/2, COMSPEC is used for the <b>shell</b> command. </p>
<p> <b>FIT_SCRIPT</b> may be used to specify a <b>gnuplot</b> command to be executed when a fit is interrupted — see <b><a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a></b>. <b>FIT_LOG</b> specifies the default filename of the logfile maintained by fit. </p>
<p> GNUPLOT_LIB may be used to define additional search directories for data and command files. The variable may contain a single directory name, or a list of directories separated by a platform-specific path separator, eg. ':' on Unix, or ';' on DOS/Windows/OS/2 platforms. The contents of GNUPLOT_LIB are appended to the <b>loadpath</b> variable, but not saved with the <b>save</b> and <b>save set</b> commands. </p>
<p> Several gnuplot terminal drivers access TrueType fonts via the gd library. For these drivers the font search path is controlled by the environmental variable GDFONTPATH. Furthermore, a default font for these drivers may be set via the environmental variable GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT. </p>
<p> The postscript terminal uses its own font search path. It is controlled by the environmental variable GNUPLOT_FONTPATH. </p>
<p> GNUPLOT_PS_DIR is used by the postscript driver to search for external prologue files. Depending on the build process, gnuplot contains either a built-in copy of those files or a default hardcoded path. You can use this variable have the postscript terminal use custom prologue files rather than the default files.
