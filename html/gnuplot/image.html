<h1 id="SECTION030170000000000000000">Image</h1>    The <b>image</b>, <b>rgbimage</b>, and <b>rgbalpha</b> plotting styles all project a uniformly sampled grid of data values onto a plane in either 2D or 3D. The input data may be an actual bitmapped image, perhaps converted from a standard format such as PNG, or a simple array of numerical values. <p>  This figure illustrates generation of a heat map from an array of scalar values. The current palette is used to map each value onto the color assigned to the corresponding pixel.  </p>

e</pre>  <p> Each pixel (data point) of the input 2D image will become a rectangle or parallelipiped in the plot. The coordinates of each data point will determine the center of the parallelipiped. That is, an M x N set of data will form an image with M x N pixels. This is different from the pm3d plotting style, where an M x N set of data will form a surface of (M-1) x (N-1) elements. The scan directions for a binary image data grid can be further controlled by additional keywords. See <b><a href="plot.html#binary_keywords_flipx">binary keywords flipx</a></b>, <b><a href="plot.html#keywords_center">keywords center</a></b>, and <b><a href="plot.html#keywords_rotate">keywords rotate</a></b>. </p>
<p> Image data can be scaled to fill a particular rectangle within a 2D plot coordinate system by specifying the x and y extent of each pixel. See <b><a href="plot.html#binary_keywords_dx">binary keywords dx</a></b> and <b><a href="plot.html#dy">dy</a></b>. To generate the figure at the right, the same input image was placed multiple times, each with a specified dx, dy, and origin. The input PNG image of a building is 50x128 pixels. The tall building was drawn by mapping this using <b>dx=0.5 dy=1.5</b>. The short building used a mapping <b>dx=0.5 dy=0.35</b>. </p>
<p> The <b>image</b> style handles input pixels containing a grayscale or color palette value. Thus 2D plots (<b>plot</b> command) require 3 columns of data (x,y,value), while 3D plots (<b>splot</b> command) require 4 columns of data (x,y,z,value). </p>
<p> The <b>rgbimage</b> style handles input pixels that are described by three separate values for the red, green, and blue components. Thus 5D data (x,y,r,g,b) is needed for <b>plot</b> and 6D data (x,y,z,r,g,b) for <b>splot</b>. The individual red, green, and blue components are assumed to lie in the range [0:255]. This matches the convention used in PNG and JPEG files (see <b><a href="plot.html#binary_filetype">binary filetype</a></b>). However some data files use an alternative convention in which RGB components are floating point values in the range [0:1]. To use the <b>rgbimage</b> style with such data, first use the command <b>set rgbmax 1.0</b>. </p>
<p> The <b>rgbalpha</b> style handles input pixels that contain alpha channel (transparency) information in addition to the red, green, and blue components. Thus 6D data (x,y,r,g,b,a) is needed for <b>plot</b> and 7D data (x,y,z,r,g,b,a) for <b>splot</b>. The r, g, b, and alpha components are assumed to lie in the range [0:255]. To plot data for which RGBA components are floating point values in the range [0:1], first use the command <b>set rgbmax 1.0</b>. </p>
<p> If only a single data column is provided for the color components of either rgbimage or rgbalpha plots, it is interpreted as containing 32 bit packed ARGB data using the convention that alpha=0 means opaque and alpha=255 means fully transparent. Note that this is backwards from the alpha convention if alpha is supplied in a separate column, but matches the ARGB packing convention for individual commands to set color. See <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles.html#colorspec">colorspec</a></b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION030171000000000000000">Transparency</h2>  The <b>rgbalpha</b> plotting style assumes that each pixel of input data contains an alpha value in the range [0:255]. A pixel with alpha = 0 is purely transparent and does not alter the underlying contents of the plot. A pixel with alpha = 255 is purely opaque. All terminal types can handle these two extreme cases. A pixel with 0 <span class="MATH">&lt;</span> alpha <span class="MATH">&lt;</span> 255 is partially transparent. Terminal types that do not support partial transparency will round this value to 0 or 255. <h2 id="SECTION030172000000000000000">Image pixels</h2>  Some terminals use device- or library-specific optimizations to render image data within a rectangular 2D area. This sometimes produces undesirable output, e.g. bad clipping or scaling, missing edges. The <b>pixels</b> keyword tells gnuplot to use generic code that renders the image pixel-by-pixel instead. This rendering mode is slower and may result in much larger output files, but should produce a consistent rendered view on all terminals. Example:  <pre>
