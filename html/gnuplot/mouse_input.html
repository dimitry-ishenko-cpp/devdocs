<h1 id="SECTION020230000000000000000">Mouse input</h1> Many terminals allow interaction with the current plot using the mouse. Some also support the definition of hotkeys to activate pre-defined functions by hitting a single key while the mouse focus is in the active plot window. It is even possible to combine mouse input with <b>batch</b> command scripts, by invoking the command <b>pause mouse</b> and then using the mouse variables returned by mouse clicking as parameters for subsequent scripted actions. See <b><a href="mouse_input.html#bind">bind</a></b> and <b><a href="mouse_input.html#mouse_variables">mouse variables</a></b>. See also the command <b><a href="set_show.html#set_mouse">set mouse</a></b>. <h2 id="SECTION020231000000000000000">Bind</h2>    Syntax:  <pre>
bind {allwindows} [&lt;key-sequence&gt;] ["&lt;gnuplot commands&gt;"]
bind &lt;key-sequence&gt; ""
reset bind</pre>  <p> The <b>bind</b> allows defining or redefining a hotkey, i.e. a sequence of gnuplot commands which will be executed when a certain key or key sequence is pressed while the driver's window has the input focus. Note that <b>bind</b> is only available if gnuplot was compiled with <b>mouse</b> support and it is used by all mouse-capable terminals. A user-specified binding supersedes any builtin bindings, except that <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>space<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and 'q' cannot normally be rebound. For an exception, see <b><a href="mouse_input.html#bind_space">bind space</a></b>. </p>
<p> Only mouse button 1 can be bound, and only for 2D plots. </p>
<p> You get the list of all hotkeys by typing <b>show bind</b> or <b>bind</b> or by typing the hotkey 'h' in the graph window. </p>
<p> Key bindings are restored to their default state by <b>reset bind</b>. </p>
<p> Note that multikey-bindings with modifiers must be given in quotes. </p>
<p> Normally hotkeys are only recognized when the currently active plot window has focus. <b>bind allwindows <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>key<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> ...</b> (short form: <b>bind all <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>key<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> ...</b>) causes the binding for <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>key<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> to apply to all gnuplot plot windows, active or not. In this case gnuplot variable MOUSE_KEY_WINDOW is set to the ID of the originating window, and may be used by the bound command. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> - set bindings: </p>
<pre>
bind a "replot"
bind "ctrl-a" "plot x*x"
bind "ctrl-alt-a" 'print "great"'

<pre>
bind "ctrl-alt-a" ""   # removes binding for ctrl-alt-a

<h3 id="SECTION020231100000000000000">Bind space</h3> If gnuplot was built with configuration option â€“enable-raise-console, then typing <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>space<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> in the plot window raises gnuplot's command window. This hotkey can be changed to ctrl-space by starting gnuplot as 'gnuplot -ctrlq', or by setting the XResource 'gnuplot*ctrlq'. See <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#x11_command-line-options">x11 command-line-options</a></b>. <h2 id="SECTION020232000000000000000">Mouse variables</h2> When <b>mousing</b> is active, clicking in the active window will set several user variables that can be accessed from the gnuplot command line. The coordinates of the mouse at the time of the click are stored in MOUSE_X MOUSE_Y MOUSE_X2 and MOUSE_Y2. The mouse button clicked, and any meta-keys active at that time, are stored in MOUSE_BUTTON MOUSE_SHIFT MOUSE_ALT and MOUSE_CTRL. These variables are set to undefined at the start of every plot, and only become defined in the event of a mouse click in the active plot window. To determine from a script if the mouse has been clicked in the active plot window, it is sufficient to test for any one of these variables being defined. <pre>
plot 'something'
pause mouse
if (exists("MOUSE_BUTTON")) call 'something_else'; \
else print "No mouse click."</pre>  <p> It is also possible to track keystrokes in the plot window using the mousing code. </p>
<pre>
plot 'something'
pause mouse keypress
print "Keystroke ", MOUSE_KEY, " at ", MOUSE_X, " ", MOUSE_Y</pre>  <p> When <b>pause mouse keypress</b> is terminated by a keypress, then MOUSE_KEY will contain the ascii character value of the key that was pressed. MOUSE_CHAR will contain the character itself as a string variable. If the pause command is terminated abnormally (e.g. by ctrl-C or by externally closing the plot window) then MOUSE_KEY will equal -1. </p>
<p> Note that after a zoom by mouse, you can read the new ranges as GPVAL_X_MIN, GPVAL_X_MAX, GPVAL_Y_MIN, and GPVAL_Y_MAX, see <b><a href="expressions.html#gnuplot-defined_variables">gnuplot-defined variables</a></b>. </p><div class="_attribution">
