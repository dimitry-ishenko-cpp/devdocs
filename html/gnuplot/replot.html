<h1 id="SECTION040250000000000000000">Replot</h1>  The <b>replot</b> command without arguments repeats the last <b>plot</b> or <b>splot</b> command. This can be useful for viewing a plot with different <b>set</b> options, or when generating the same plot for several devices. <p> Arguments specified after a <b>replot</b> command will be added onto the last <b>plot</b> or <b>splot</b> command (with an implied ',' separator) before it is repeated. <b>replot</b> accepts the same arguments as the <b>plot</b> and <b>splot</b> commands except that ranges cannot be specified. Thus you can use <b>replot</b> to plot a function against the second axes if the previous command was <b>plot</b> but not if it was <b>splot</b>. </p>
<p> N.B. â€” use of </p>
<pre>
plot '-' ; ... ; replot</pre>  <p> is not recommended, because it will require that you type in the data all over again. In most cases you can use the <b>refresh</b> command instead, which will redraw the plot using the data previously read in. </p>
<p> Note that in multiplot mode, <b>replot</b> can only reproduce the most recent component plot, not the full set. </p>
