<h1 id="SECTION030360000000000000000">Yerrorlines</h1>  The <b>yerrorlines</b> (or <b>errorlines</b>) style is only relevant to 2D data plots. <b>yerrorlines</b> is like <b>linespoints</b>, except that a vertical error line is also drawn. At each point (x,y), a line is drawn from (x,y-ydelta) to (x,y+ydelta) or from (x,ylow) to (x,yhigh), depending on how many data columns are provided. The appearance of the tic mark at the ends of the bar is controlled by <b>set errorbars</b>. Either 3 or 4 input columns are required. <pre>
3 columns:  x  y  ydelta
4 columns:  x  y  ylow  yhigh</pre>  <p> An additional input column (4th or 5th) may be used to provide information such as variable point color. </p>
