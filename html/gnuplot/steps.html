<h1 id="SECTION030270000000000000000">Steps</h1>  The <b>steps</b> style is only relevant to 2D plotting. It connects consecutive points with two line segments: the first from (x1,y1) to (x2,y1) and the second from (x2,y1) to (x2,y2). The input column requires are the same as for plot styles <b>lines</b> and <b>points</b>. The difference between <b>fsteps</b> and <b>steps</b> is that <b>fsteps</b> traces first the change in y and then the change in x. <b>steps</b> traces first the change in x and then the change in y. To fill the area between the curve and the baseline at y=0, use <b>fillsteps</b>.
