<h1 id="SECTION020270000000000000000">Start-up (initialization)</h1>      When gnuplot is run, it first looks for a system-wide initialization file <b>gnuplotrc</b>. The location of this file is determined when the program is built and is reported by <b>show loadpath</b>. The program then looks in the user's HOME directory for a file called <b>.gnuplot</b> on Unix-like systems or <b>GNUPLOT.INI</b> on other systems. (OS/2 will look for it in the directory named in the environment variable <b>GNUPLOT</b>; Windows will use <b>APPDATA</b>). Note: The program can be configured to look first in the current directory, but this is not recommended because it is bad security practice.<div class="_attribution">
