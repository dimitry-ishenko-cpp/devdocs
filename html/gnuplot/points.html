<h1 id="SECTION030240000000000000000">Points</h1>   The <b>points</b> style displays a small symbol at each point. The command <b>set pointsize</b> may be used to change the default size of all points. The point type defaults to that of the linetype. See <b><a href="set_show.html#linetype">linetype</a></b>. If no <b>using</b> spec is found in the plot command, input data columns are interpreted implicitly in the order  <pre>
x y pointsize pointtype color</pre>  Any columns beyond the first two (x and y) are optional; they correspond to additional plot properties <b>pointsize variable</b>, <b>pointtype variable</b>, etc. <p> The first 8 point types are shared by all terminals. Individual terminals may provide a much larger number of distinct point types. Use the <b>test</b> command to show what is provided by the current terminal settings. </p>
<p> Alternatively any single printable character may be given instead of a numerical point type, as in the example below. You may use any unicode character as the pointtype (assumes utf8 support). See <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#escape_sequences">escape sequences</a></b>. Longer strings may be plotted using plot style <b>labels</b> rather than <b>points</b>. </p>
<pre>
plot f(x) with points pt "#"
plot d(x) with points pt "\U+2299"</pre>  <p>   When using the keywords <b>pointtype</b>, <b>pointsize</b>, or <b>linecolor</b> in a plot command, the additional keyword <b>variable</b> may be given instead of a number. In this case the corresponding properties of each point are assigned by additional columns of input data. Variable pointsize is always taken from the first additional column provided in a <b>using</b> spec. Variable color is always taken from the last additional column. See <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles.html#colorspec">colorspec</a></b>. If all three properties are specified for each point, the order of input data columns is thus </p>
