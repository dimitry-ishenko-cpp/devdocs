<h1 id="SECTION05010000000000000000">Complete list of terminals</h1>   Gnuplot supports a large number of output formats. These are selected by choosing an appropriate terminal type, possibly with additional modifying options. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_terminal">set terminal</a></b>. <p> This document may describe terminal types that are not available to you because they were not configured or installed on your system. To see a list of terminals available on a particular gnuplot installation, type 'set terminal' with no modifiers. </p>
<p> Terminals marked <b>legacy</b> are not built by default in recent gnuplot versions and may not actually work. </p>

<p> The aqua terminal supports enhanced text mode (see <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced">enhanced</a></b>), except for overprint. Font support is limited to the fonts available on the system. Character encoding can be selected by <b>set encoding</b> and currently supports iso_latin_1, iso_latin_2, cp1250, and UTF8 (default). </p>
<p> Lines can be drawn either solid or dashed, (default is solid) and the dash spacing can be modified by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>dashlength<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> which is a multiplier <span class="MATH">&gt;</span> 0. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION05013000000000000000">Be</h2>   The <b>be</b> terminal type is present if gnuplot is built for the <b>beos</b> operating system and for use with X servers.

<p> Plot windows remain open even when the <b>gnuplot</b> driver is changed to a different device. A plot window can be closed by pressing the letter q while that window has input focus, or by choosing <b>close</b> from a window manager menu. All plot windows can be closed by specifying <b>reset</b>, which actually terminates the subprocess which maintains the windows (unless <b>-persist</b> was specified). </p>
<p> Plot windows will automatically be closed at the end of the session unless the <b>-persist</b> option was given. </p>
<p> The size or aspect ratio of a plot may be changed by resizing the <b>gnuplot</b> window. </p>
<p> Linewidths and pointsizes may be changed from within <b>gnuplot</b> with <b>set linestyle</b>. </p>
<p> For terminal type <b>be</b>, <b>gnuplot</b> accepts (when initialized) the standard X Toolkit options and resources such as geometry, font, and name from the command line arguments or a configuration file. See the X(1) man page (or its equivalent) for a description of such options. </p>

In contrast to the <b>dumb</b> terminal it includes support for color, box fill, images, rotated text, filled polygons, and mouse interaction. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal caca {{driver | format} {default | &lt;driver&gt; | list}}
                  {color | monochrome}
                  {{no}inverted}

                  {size &lt;width&gt;,&lt;height&gt;}
                  {charset ascii|blocks|unicode}</pre>  <p> The <b>driver</b> option selects the <b>libcaca</b> display driver or export <b>format</b>. Use <b>default</b> is to let <b>libcaca</b> choose the platform default display driver. The default driver can be changed by setting the environment variable CACA_DRIVER before starting <b>gnuplot</b>. Use <b>set term caca driver list</b> to print a list of supported output modes. </p>
<p> The <b>color</b> and <b>monochrome</b> options select colored or mono output. Note that this also changes line symbols. Use the <b>inverted</b> option if you prefer a black background over the default white. This also changes the color of black default linetypes to white. </p>
<p> Enhanced text support can be activated using the <b>enhanced</b> option, see <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced_text">enhanced text</a></b>. </p>
<p> The title of the output window can be changed with the <b>title</b> option, if supported by the <b>libcaca</b> driver. </p>
<p> The <b>size</b> option selects the size of the canvas in characters. The default is 80 by 25. If supported by the backend, the canvas size will be automatically adjusted to the current window/terminal size. The default size of the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>x11<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>gl<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> window can be controlled via the CACA_GEOMETRY environment variable. The geometry of the window of the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>win32<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> driver can be controlled and permanently changed via the app menu. </p>
<p> The <b>charset</b> option selects the character set used for lines, points, filling of polygons and boxes and dithering of images. Note that some backend/terminal/font combinations might not support some characters of the <b>blocks</b> or <b>unicode</b> character set. On Windows it is recommend to use a non-raster font such as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Lucida Console<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Consolas<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> The caca terminal supports mouse interaction. Please beware that some backends of <b>libcaca</b> (e.g. slang, ncurses) only update the mouse position on mouse clicks. Modifier keys (ctrl, alt, shift) are not supported by <b>libcaca</b> and are thus unavailable. </p>
<p> The default <b>encoding</b> of the <b>caca</b> terminal is utf8. It also supports the cp437 <b>encoding</b>. </p>
<p> The number of colors supported by <b>libcaca</b> backends differs. Most backends support 16 foreground and 16 background colors only, whereas e.g. the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>x11<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> backend supports truecolor. </p>
<p> Depending on the terminal and <b>libcaca</b> backend, only 8 different background colors might be supported. Bright colors (with the most most significant bit of the background color set) are then interpreted as indicator for blinking text. Try using <b>background rgb <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>gray<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b> in that case. </p>
<p> See also the libcaca web site at <a href="http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca </span></a> </p>

<h3 id="SECTION05014100000000000000">Caca limitations and bugs</h3> The <b>caca</b> terminal has known bugs and limitations: <p> Unicode support depends on the driver and the terminal. The <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>x11<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> backend supports unicode since libcaca version 0.99.beta17. Due to a bug in <b>libcaca</b> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>0.99.beta20, the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>slang<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> driver does not support unicode. Note that <b>libcaca</b> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>0.99.beta19 contains a bug which results in an endless loop if you supply illegal 8bit sequences. </p>
<p> Bright background colors may cause blinking. </p>
<p> Modifier keys are not supported for mousing, see <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#term_caca">term caca</a></b>. </p>
<p> Rotated enhanced text, and transparency are not supported. The <b>size</b> option is not considered for on-screen display. </p>
<p> In order to correctly draw the key box, use </p>
<pre>
set key width 1 height 1</pre>  <p> Alignment of enhanced text is wrong if it contains utf8 characters. Resizing of Windows console window does not work correctly due to a bug in libcaca. Closing the terminal window by clicking the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>X<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> on the title line will terminate wgnuplot. Press <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>q<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> to close the window. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION05015000000000000000">Cairolatex</h2>  The <b>cairolatex</b> terminal device generates encapsulated PostScript (*.eps), PDF, or PNG output using the cairo and pango support libraries and uses LaTeX for text output using the same routines as the <b>epslatex</b> terminal. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal cairolatex
               {eps | pdf | png}
               {standalone | input}
               {blacktext | colortext | colourtext}

               {linewidth &lt;lw&gt;} {rounded|butt|square} {dashlength &lt;dl&gt;}
               {size &lt;XX&gt;{unit},&lt;YY&gt;{unit}}
               {resolution &lt;dpi&gt;}</pre>  <p> The cairolatex terminal prints a plot like <b>terminal epscairo</b> or <b>terminal pdfcairo</b> but transfers the texts to LaTeX instead of including them in the graph. For reference of options not explained here see <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#pdfcairo">pdfcairo</a></b>. </p>
<p> <b>eps</b>, <b>pdf</b>, or <b>png</b> select the type of graphics output. Use <b>eps</b> with latex/dvips and <b>pdf</b> for pdflatex. If your plot has a huge number of points use <b>png</b> to keep the filesize down. When using the <b>png</b> option, the terminal accepts an extra option <b>resolution</b> to control the pixel density of the resulting PNG. The argument of <b>resolution</b> is an integer with the implied unit of DPI. </p>
<p> <b>blacktext</b> forces all text to be written in black even in color mode; </p>
<p> The <b>cairolatex</b> driver offers a special way of controlling text positioning: (a) If any text string begins with '{', you also need to include a '}' at the end of the text, and the whole text will be centered both horizontally and vertically by LaTeX. (b) If the text string begins with '[', you need to continue it with: a position specification (up to two out of t,b,l,r,c), ']{', the text itself, and finally, '}'. The text itself may be anything LaTeX can typeset as an LR-box.  <span class="MATH">\</span>rule{}{}'s may help for best positioning. See also the documentation for the <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#pslatex">pslatex</a></b> terminal driver. To create multiline labels, use  <span class="MATH">\</span>shortstack, for example  </p>
<pre>
set ylabel '[r]{\shortstack{first line \\ second line}}'</pre>  <p> The <b>back</b> option of <b>set label</b> commands is handled slightly different than in other terminals. Labels using 'back' are printed behind all other elements of the plot while labels using 'front' are printed above everything else. </p>
<p> The driver produces two different files, one for the eps, pdf, or png part of the figure and one for the LaTeX part. The name of the LaTeX file is taken from the <b>set output</b> command. The name of the eps/pdf/png file is derived by replacing the file extension (normally '.tex') with '.eps'/'.pdf'/'.png' instead. There is no LaTeX output if no output file is given! Remember to close the <b>output file</b> before next plot unless in <b>multiplot</b> mode. </p>
<p> In your LaTeX documents use ' <span class="MATH">\</span>input{filename}' to include the figure. The '.eps'/'.pdf'/'.png' file is included by the command  <span class="MATH">\</span>includegraphics{...}, so you must also include  <span class="MATH">\</span>usepackage{graphicx} in the LaTeX preamble. If you want to use coloured text (option <b>colourtext</b>) you also have to include  <span class="MATH">\</span>usepackage{color} in the LaTeX preamble. </p>
<p> The behaviour concerning font selection depends on the header mode. In all cases, the given font size is used for the calculation of proper spacing. When not using the <b>standalone</b> mode the actual LaTeX font and font size at the point of inclusion is taken, so use LaTeX commands for changing fonts. If you use e.g. 12pt as font size for your LaTeX document, use '<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, 12<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>' as options. The font name is ignored. If using <b>standalone</b> the given font and font size are used, see below for a detailed description. </p>
<p> If text is printed coloured is controlled by the TeX booleans  <span class="MATH">\</span>ifGPcolor and  <span class="MATH">\</span>ifGPblacktext. Only if  <span class="MATH">\</span>ifGPcolor is true and  <span class="MATH">\</span>ifGPblacktext is false, text is printed coloured. You may either change them in the generated TeX file or provide them globally in your TeX file, for example by using  </p>
<pre>
\newif\ifGPblacktext
\GPblacktexttrue</pre>  in the preamble of your document. The local assignment is only done if no global value is given. <p> When using the cairolatex terminal give the name of the TeX file in the <b>set output</b> command including the file extension (normally <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>.tex<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>). The graph filename is generated by replacing the extension. </p>
<p> If using the <b>standalone</b> mode a complete LaTeX header is added to the LaTeX file; and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>-inc<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is added to the filename of the gaph file. The <b>standalone</b> mode generates a TeX file that produces output with the correct size when using dvips, pdfTeX, or VTeX. The default, <b>input</b>, generates a file that has to be included into a LaTeX document using the  <span class="MATH">\</span>input command. </p>
<p> If a font other than <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>default<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is given it is interpreted as LaTeX font name. It contains up to three parts, separated by a comma: 'fontname,fontseries,fontshape'. If the default fontshape or fontseries are requested, they can be omitted. Thus, the real syntax for the fontname is '{fontname}{,fontseries}{,fontshape}'. The naming convention for all parts is given by the LaTeX font scheme. The fontname is 3 to 4 characters long and is built as follows: One character for the font vendor, two characters for the name of the font, and optionally one additional character for special fonts, e.g., 'j' for fonts with old-style numerals or 'x' for expert fonts. The names of many fonts is described in <a href="http://www.tug.org/fontname/fontname.pdf"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.tug.org/fontname/fontname.pdf </span></a> </p>
<p> For example, 'cmr' stands for Computer Modern Roman, 'ptm' for Times-Roman, and 'phv' for Helvetica. The font series denotes the thickness of the glyphs, in most cases 'm' for normal (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>medium<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>) and 'bx' or 'b' for bold fonts. The font shape is 'n' for upright, 'it' for italics, 'sl' for slanted, or 'sc' for small caps, in general. Some fonts may provide different font series or shapes. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> Use Times-Roman boldface (with the same shape as in the surrounding text):  </p>
<pre>
set terminal cairolatex font 'ptm,bx'</pre>  Use Helvetica, boldface, italics:  <pre>
set terminal cairolatex font 'phv,bx,it'</pre>  Continue to use the surrounding font in slanted shape:  <pre>
set terminal cairolatex font ',,sl'</pre>  Use small capitals:  <pre>
set terminal cairolatex font ',,sc'</pre>  <p> By this method, only text fonts are changed. If you also want to change the math fonts you have to use the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>gnuplot.cfg<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> file or the <b>header</b> option, described below. </p>
<p> In <b>standalone</b> mode, the font size is taken from the given font size in the <b>set terminal</b> command. To be able to use a specified font size, a file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>size<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>size<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>.clo<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> has to reside in the LaTeX search path. By default, 10pt, 11pt, and 12pt are supported. If the package <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>extsizes<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is installed, 8pt, 9pt, 14pt, 17pt, and 20pt are added. </p>
<p> The <b>header</b> option takes a string as argument. This string is written into the generated LaTeX file. If using the <b>standalone</b> mode, it is written into the preamble, directly before the  <span class="MATH">\</span>begin{document} command. In the <b>input</b> mode, it is placed directly after the  <span class="MATH">\</span>begingroup command to ensure that all settings are local to the plot. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> Use T1 fontencoding, change the text and math font to Times-Roman as well as the sans-serif font to Helvetica:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal cairolatex standalone header \
"\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage{mathptmx}\n\\usepackage{helvet}"</pre>  Use a boldface font in the plot, not influencing the text outside the plot:  <pre>
set terminal cairolatex input header "\\bfseries"</pre>  <p> If the file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>gnuplot.cfg<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is found by LaTeX it is input in the preamble the LaTeX document, when using <b>standalone</b> mode. It can be used for further settings, e.g., changing the document font to Times-Roman, Helvetica, and Courier, including math fonts (handled by <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>mathptmx.sty<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>):  </p>
<pre>
\usepackage{mathptmx}
\usepackage[scaled=0.92]{helvet}
\usepackage{courier}</pre>  The file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>gnuplot.cfg<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is loaded before the header information given by the <b>header</b> command. Thus, you can use <b>header</b> to overwrite some of settings performed using <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>gnuplot.cfg<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <h2 id="SECTION05016000000000000000">Canvas</h2>  <p> The <b>canvas</b> terminal creates a set of javascript commands that draw onto the HTML5 canvas element. Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal canvas {size &lt;xsize&gt;, &lt;ysize&gt;} {background &lt;rgb_color&gt;}
                    {font {&lt;fontname&gt;}{,&lt;fontsize&gt;}} | {fsize &lt;fontsize&gt;}
                    {{no}enhanced} {linewidth &lt;lw&gt;}
                    {rounded | butt | square}
                    {dashlength &lt;dl&gt;}
                    {standalone {mousing} | name '&lt;funcname&gt;'}
                    {jsdir 'URL/for/javascripts'}
                    {title '&lt;some string&gt;'}</pre>  <p> where <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>xsize<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ysize<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> set the size of the plot area in pixels. The default size in standalone mode is 600 by 400 pixels. The default font size is 10. </p>
<p> NB: Only one font is available, the ascii portion of Hershey simplex Roman provided in the file canvastext.js. You can replace this with the file canvasmath.js, which contains also UTF-8 encoded Hershey simplex Greek and math symbols. For consistency with other terminals, it is also possible to use <b>font <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>name,size<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b>. Currently the font <b>name</b> is ignored, but browser support for named fonts is likely to arrive eventually. </p>
<p> The default <b>standalone</b> mode creates an html page containing javascript code that renders the plot using the HTML 5 canvas element. The html page links to two required javascript files 'canvastext.js' and 'gnuplot_common.js'. An additional file 'gnuplot_dashedlines.js' is needed to support dashed lines. By default these point to local files, on unix-like systems usually in directory /usr/local/share/gnuplot/<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>version<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>/js. See installation notes for other platforms. You can change this by using the <b>jsdir</b> option to specify either a different local directory or a general URL. The latter is usually appropriate if the plot is exported for viewing on remote client machines. </p>
<p> All plots produced by the canvas terminal are mouseable. The additional keyword <b>mousing</b> causes the <b>standalone</b> mode to add a mouse-tracking box underneath the plot. It also adds a link to a javascript file 'gnuplot_mouse.js' and to a stylesheet for the mouse box 'gnuplot_mouse.css' in the same local or URL directory as 'canvastext.js'. </p>
<p> The <b>name</b> option creates a file containing only javascript. Both the javascript function it contains and the id of the canvas element that it draws onto are taken from the following string parameter. The commands  </p>
<pre>
set term canvas name 'fishplot'
set output 'fishplot.js'</pre>  will create a file containing a javascript function fishplot() that will draw onto a canvas with id=fishplot. An html page that invokes this javascript function must also load the canvastext.js function as described above. A minimal html file to wrap the fishplot created above might be: <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="canvastext.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="gnuplot_common.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body onload="fishplot();"&gt;
    &lt;script src="fishplot.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="fishplot" width=600 height=400&gt;
        &lt;div id="err_msg"&gt;No support for HTML 5 canvas element&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>  <p> The individual plots drawn on this canvas will have names fishplot_plot_1, fishplot_plot_2, and so on. These can be referenced by external javascript routines, for example gnuplot.toggle_visibility(<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>fishplot_plot_2<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>). </p>

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Cgmimp32.hlp</pre>  and/or its configuration file, which you may find here:  <pre>
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Grphflt\Cgmimp32.cfg</pre>  <p> In the <b>set term</b> command, you may specify a font name which does not appear in the default font table. In that case, a new font table is constructed with the specified font as its first entry. You must ensure that the spelling, capitalization, and spacing of the name are appropriate for the application that will read the CGM file. (Gnuplot and any MIL-D-28003A compliant application ignore case in font names.) If you need to add several new fonts, use several <b>set term</b> commands. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal cgm 'Old English'
set terminal cgm 'Tengwar'
set terminal cgm 'Arabic'
set output 'myfile.cgm'

<h3 id="SECTION05017200000000000000">Cgm fontsize</h3> Fonts are scaled assuming the page is 6 inches wide. If the <b>size</b> command is used to change the aspect ratio of the page or the CGM file is converted to a different width, the resulting font sizes will be scaled up or down accordingly. To change the assumed width, use the <b>width</b> option. <h3 id="SECTION05017300000000000000">Cgm linewidth</h3> The <b>linewidth</b> option sets the width of lines in pt. The default width is 1 pt. Scaling is affected by the actual width of the page, as discussed under the <b>fontsize</b> and <b>width</b> options. <h3 id="SECTION05017400000000000000">Cgm rotate</h3> The <b>norotate</b> option may be used to disable text rotation. For example, the CGM input filter for Word for Windows 6.0c can accept rotated text, but the DRAW editor within Word cannot. If you edit a graph (for example, to label a curve), all rotated text is restored to horizontal. The Y axis label will then extend beyond the clip boundary. With <b>norotate</b>, the Y axis label starts in a less attractive location, but the page can be edited without damage. The <b>rotate</b> option confirms the default behavior. <h3 id="SECTION05017500000000000000">Cgm solid</h3> The <b>solid</b> option may be used to disable dashed line styles in the plots. This is useful when color is enabled and the dashing of the lines detracts from the appearance of the plot. The <b>dashed</b> option confirms the default behavior, which gives a different dash pattern to each line type. <h3 id="SECTION05017600000000000000">Cgm size</h3> Default size of a CGM plot is 32599 units wide and 23457 units high for landscape, or 23457 units wide by 32599 units high for portrait. <h3 id="SECTION05017700000000000000">Cgm width</h3> All distances in the CGM file are in abstract units. The application that reads the file determines the size of the final plot. By default, the width of the final plot is assumed to be 6 inches (15.24 cm). This distance is used to calculate the correct font size, and may be changed with the <b>width</b> option. The keyword should be followed by the width in points. (Here, a point is 1/72 inch, as in PostScript. This unit is known as a <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>big point<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> in TeX.) Gnuplot <b>expressions</b> can be used to convert from other units. <p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal cgm width 432            # default
set terminal cgm width 6*72           # same as above
set terminal cgm width 10/2.54*72     # 10 cm wide</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION05017800000000000000">Cgm nofontlist</h3> The default font table includes the fonts recommended for WebCGM, which are compatible with the Computer Graphics Metafile input filter for Microsoft Office and Corel Draw. Another application might use different fonts and/or different font names, which may not be documented. The <b>nofontlist</b> (synonym <b>winword6</b>) option deletes the font table from the CGM file. In this case, the reading application should use a default table. Gnuplot will still use its own default font table to select font indices. Thus, 'Helvetica' will give you an index of 1, which should get you the first entry in your application's default font table. 'Helvetica Bold' will give you its second entry, etc. <h2 id="SECTION05018000000000000000">Context</h2>  ConTeXt is a macro package for TeX, highly integrated with Metapost (for drawing figures) and intended for creation of high-quality PDF documents. The terminal outputs Metafun source, which can be edited manually, but you should be able to configure most things from outside. <p> For an average user of ConTeXt + gnuplot module it's recommended to refer to <b>Using ConTeXt</b> rather than reading this page or to read the manual of the gnuplot module for ConTeXt. </p>
<p> The <b>context</b> terminal supports the following options: </p>
<p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set term context {default}
        {defaultsize | size &lt;scale&gt; | size &lt;xsize&gt;{in|cm}, &lt;ysize&gt;{in|cm}}
        {input | standalone}
        {timestamp | notimestamp}
        {noheader | header "&lt;header&gt;"}
        {color | colour | monochrome}
        {rounded | mitered | beveled} {round | butt | squared}
        {dashed | solid} {dashlength | dl &lt;dl&gt;}
        {linewidth | lw &lt;lw&gt;}
        {fontscale &lt;fontscale&gt;}
        {mppoints | texpoints}
        {inlineimages | externalimages}
        {defaultfont | font "{&lt;fontname&gt;}{,&lt;fontsize&gt;}"}</pre>  <p> In non-standalone (<b>input</b>) graphic only parameters <b>size</b> to select graphic size, <b>fontscale</b> to scale all the labels for a factor <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fontscale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and font size, make sense, the rest is silently ignored and should be configured in the .tex file which inputs the graphic. It's highly recommended to set the proper fontsize if document font differs from 12pt, so that gnuplot will know how much space to reserve for labels. </p>
<p> <b>default</b> resets all the options to their default values. </p>
<p> <b>defaultsize</b> sets the plot size to 5in,3in. <b>size</b> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>scale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> sets the plot size to <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>scale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> times <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>default value<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. If two arguments are given (separated with ','), the first one sets the horizontal size and the second one the vertical size. Size may be given without units (in which case it means relative to the default value), with inches ('in') or centimeters ('cm'). </p>
<p> <b>input</b> (default) creates a graphic that can be included into another ConTeXt document. <b>standalone</b> adds some lines, so that the document might be compiled as-is. You might also want to add <b>header</b> in that case. </p>
<p> Use <b>header</b> for any additional settings/definitions/macros that you might want to include in a standalone graphic. <b>noheader</b> is the default. </p>
<p> <b>notimestamp</b> prevents printing creation time in comments (if version control is used, one may prefer not to commit new version when only date changes). </p>
<p> <b>color</b> to make color plots is the default, but <b>monochrome</b> doesn't do anything special yet. If you have any good ideas how the behaviour should differ to suit the monochrome printers better, your suggestions are welcome. </p>
<p> <b>rounded</b> (default), <b>mitered</b> and <b>beveled</b> control the shape of line joins. <b>round</b> (default), <b>butt</b> and <b>squared</b> control the shape of line caps. See PostScript or PDF Reference Manual for explanation. For wild-behaving functions and thick lines it is better to use <b>rounded</b> and <b>round</b> to prevent sharp corners in line joins. (Some general support for this should be added to Gnuplot, so that the same options could be set for each line (style) separately). </p>
<p> <b>dashed</b> (default) uses different dash patterns for different line types, <b>solid</b> draws all plots with solid lines. </p>
<p> <b>dashlength</b> or <b>dl</b> scales the length of the dashed-line segments by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>dl<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. <b>linewidth</b> or <b>lw</b> scales all linewidths by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>lw<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. (lw 1 stands for 0.5bp, which is the default line width when drawing with Metapost.) <b>fontscale</b> scales text labels for factor <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fontscale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> relative to default document font. </p>
<p> <b>mppoints</b> uses predefined point shapes, drawn in Metapost. <b>texpoints</b> uses easily configurable set of symbols, defined with ConTeXt in the following way:  </p>
<pre>
\defineconversion[my own points][+,{\ss x},\mathematics{\circ}]
\setupGNUPLOTterminal[context][points=tex,pointset=my own points]</pre>  <p> <b>inlineimages</b> writes binary images to a string and only works in ConTeXt MKIV. <b>externalimages</b> writes PNG files to disk and also works with ConTeXt MKII. Gnuplot needs to have support for PNG images built in for this to work. </p>
<p> With <b>font</b> you can set font name and size in standalone graphics. In non-standalone (<b>input</b>) mode only the font size is important to reserve enough space for text labels. The command  </p>
<pre>
set term context font "myfont,ss,10"</pre>  will result in  <pre>
\setupbodyfont[myfont,ss,10pt]</pre>  If you additionally set <b>fontscale</b> to 0.8 for example, then the resulting font will be 8pt big and  <pre>
set label ... font "myfont,12"</pre>  will come out as 9.6pt. <p> It is your own responsibility to provide proper typescripts (and header), otherwise switching the font will have no effect. For a standard font in ConTeXt MKII (pdfTeX) you could use:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal context standalone header '\usetypescript[iwona][ec]' \
    font "iwona,ss,11"</pre>  Please take a look into ConTeXt documentation, wiki or mailing list (archives) for any up-to-date information about font usage. <p> Examples:  </p>

<p> The <b>aspect</b> option can be used to control the aspect ratio of the plot by setting the length of the horizontal and vertical tic marks. Only integer values are allowed. Default is 2,1 – corresponding to the aspect ratio of common screen fonts. </p>
<p> The <b>ansi</b>, <b>ansi256</b>, and <b>ansirgb</b> options will include escape sequences in the output to handle colors. Note that these might not be handled by your terminal. Default is <b>mono</b>. To obtain the best color match in <b>ansi</b> mode, you should use <b>set colorsequence classic</b>. Depending on the mode, the <b>dumb</b> terminal will emit the following sequences (without the additional whitespace): </p>

<p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>

                   {small|tiny|&lt;fontsize&gt;}</pre>  <p> <b>color</b> causes gnuplot to produce  <span class="MATH">\</span>color{...} commands so that the graphs are colored. Using this option, you must include  <span class="MATH">\</span>usepackage{color} in the preamble of your latex document. </p>
<p> <b>dashed</b> will allow dashed line types; without this option, only solid lines with varying thickness will be used. <b>dashed</b> and <b>color</b> are mutually exclusive; if <b>color</b> is specified, then <b>dashed</b> will be ignored. </p>
<p> <b>rotate</b> will enable true rotated text (by 90 degrees). Otherwise, rotated text will be typeset with letters stacked above each other. If you use this option you must include  <span class="MATH">\</span>usepackage{graphicx} in the preamble. </p>
<p> <b>small</b> will use  <span class="MATH">\</span>scriptsize symbols as point markers. Default is to use the default math size. <b>tiny</b> uses  <span class="MATH">\</span>scriptscriptstyle symbols. </p>
<p> The default size of an eepic plot is 5x3 inches. You can change this using the <b>size</b> terminal option. </p>
<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fontsize<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is a number which specifies the font size inside the picture environment; the unit is pt (points), i.e., 10 pt equals approx. 3.5 mm. If fontsize is not specified, then all text inside the picture will be set in  <span class="MATH">\</span>footnotesize. </p>
<p> <b>default</b> resets all options to their defaults = no color, no dashed lines, pseudo-rotated (stacked) text, large point symbols. </p>
<p> Notes: </p>
<p> Remember to escape the # character (or other chars meaningful to (La-)TeX) by  <span class="MATH">\</span> <span class="MATH">\</span> (2 backslashes). </p>
<p> It seems that dashed lines become solid lines when the vertices of a plot are too close. (I do not know if that is a general problem with the tpic specials, or if it is caused by a bug in eepic.sty or dvips/dvipdfm.) </p>
<p> Points, among other things, are drawn using the LaTeX commands <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>Diamond<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>Box<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, etc. These commands no longer belong to the LaTeX2e core; they are included in the latexsym package, which is part of the base distribution and thus part of any LaTeX implementation. Please do not forget to use this package. Instead of latexsym, you can also include the amssymb package. </p>
<p> All drivers for LaTeX offer a special way of controlling text positioning: If any text string begins with '{', you also need to include a '}' at the end of the text, and the whole text will be centered both horizontally and vertically. If the text string begins with '[', you need to follow this with a position specification (up to two out of t,b,l,r), ']{', the text itself, and finally '}'. The text itself may be anything LaTeX can typeset as an LR-box. ' <span class="MATH">\</span>rule{}{}'s may help for best positioning. </p>

<p> The appearance of the epslatex terminal changed between versions 4.0 and 4.2 to reach better consistency with the postscript terminal: The plot size has been changed from 5 x 3 inches to 5 x 3.5 inches; the character width is now estimated to be 60% of the font size while the old epslatex terminal used 50%; now, the larger number of postscript linetypes and symbols are used. To reach an appearance that is nearly identical to the old one specify the option <b>oldstyle</b>. (In fact some small differences remain: the symbol sizes are slightly different, the tics are half as large as in the old terminal which can be changed using <b>set tics scale</b>, and the arrows have all features as in the postscript terminal.) </p>
<p> If you see the error message  </p>
<pre>
"Can't find PostScript prologue file ... "</pre>  Please see and follow the instructions in <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#postscript_prologue">postscript prologue</a></b>. <p> The option <b>color</b> enables color, while <b>monochrome</b> prefers black and white drawing elements. Further, <b>monochrome</b> uses gray <b>palette</b> but it does not change color of objects specified with an explicit <b>colorspec</b>. <b>dashlength</b> or <b>dl</b> scales the length of dashed-line segments by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>DL<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, which is a floating-point number greater than zero. <b>linewidth</b> or <b>lw</b> scales all linewidths by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>LW<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. </p>
<p> By default the generated PostScript code uses language features that were introduced in PostScript Level 2, notably filters and pattern-fill of irregular objects such as filledcurves. PostScript Level 2 features are conditionally protected so that PostScript Level 1 interpreters do not issue errors but, rather, display a message or a PostScript Level 1 approximation. The <b>level1</b> option substitutes PostScript Level 1 approximations of these features and uses no PostScript Level 2 code. This may be required by some old printers and old versions of Adobe Illustrator. The flag <b>level1</b> can be toggled later by editing a single line in the PostScript output file to force PostScript Level 1 interpretation. In the case of files containing level 2 code, the above features will not appear or will be replaced by a note when this flag is set or when the interpreting program does not indicate that it understands level 2 PostScript or higher. The flag <b>level3</b> enables PNG encoding for bitmapped images, which can reduce the output size considerably. </p>
<p> <b>rounded</b> sets line caps and line joins to be rounded; <b>butt</b> is the default, butt caps and mitered joins. </p>
<p> <b>clip</b> tells PostScript to clip all output to the bounding box; <b>noclip</b> is the default. </p>
<p> <b>palfuncparam</b> controls how <b>set palette functions</b> are encoded as gradients in the output. Analytic color component functions (set via <b>set palette functions</b>) are encoded as linear interpolated gradients in the postscript output: The color component functions are sampled at <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>samples<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> points and all points are removed from this gradient which can be removed without changing the resulting colors by more than <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>maxdeviation<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. For almost every useful palette you may safely leave the defaults of <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>samples<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>=2000 and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>maxdeviation<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>=0.003 untouched. </p>
<p> The default size for postscript output is 10 inches x 7 inches. The default for eps output is 5 x 3.5 inches. The <b>size</b> option changes this to whatever the user requests. By default the X and Y sizes are taken to be in inches, but other units are possibly (currently only cm). The BoundingBox of the plot is correctly adjusted to contain the resized image. Screen coordinates always run from 0.0 to 1.0 along the full length of the plot edges as specified by the <b>size</b> option. NB: <b>this is a change from the previously recommended method of using the set size command prior to setting the terminal type</b>. The old method left the BoundingBox unchanged and screen coordinates did not correspond to the actual limits of the plot. </p>
<p> <b>blacktext</b> forces all text to be written in black even in color mode; </p>
<p> The epslatex driver offers a special way of controlling text positioning: (a) If any text string begins with '{', you also need to include a '}' at the end of the text, and the whole text will be centered both horizontally and vertically by LaTeX. (b) If the text string begins with '[', you need to continue it with: a position specification (up to two out of t,b,l,r,c), ']{', the text itself, and finally, '}'. The text itself may be anything LaTeX can typeset as an LR-box.  <span class="MATH">\</span>rule{}{}'s may help for best positioning. See also the documentation for the <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#pslatex">pslatex</a></b> terminal driver. To create multiline labels, use  <span class="MATH">\</span>shortstack, for example  </p>
<pre>
set ylabel '[r]{\shortstack{first line \\ second line}}'</pre>  <p> The <b>back</b> option of <b>set label</b> commands is handled slightly different than in other terminals. Labels using 'back' are printed behind all other elements of the plot while labels using 'front' are printed above everything else. </p>
<p> The driver produces two different files, one for the eps part of the figure and one for the LaTeX part. The name of the LaTeX file is taken from the <b>set output</b> command. The name of the eps file is derived by replacing the file extension (normally <b>.tex</b>) with <b>.eps</b> instead. There is no LaTeX output if no output file is given! Remember to close the <b>output file</b> before next plot unless in <b>multiplot</b> mode. </p>
<p> In your LaTeX documents use ' <span class="MATH">\</span>input{filename}' to include the figure. The <b>.eps</b> file is included by the command  <span class="MATH">\</span>includegraphics{...}, so you must also include  <span class="MATH">\</span>usepackage{graphicx} in the LaTeX preamble. If you want to use coloured text (option <b>textcolour</b>) you also have to include  <span class="MATH">\</span>usepackage{color} in the LaTeX preamble. </p>
<p> Pdf files can be made from the eps file using 'epstopdf'. If the graphics package is properly configured, the LaTeX files can also be processed by pdflatex without changes, using the pdf files instead of the eps files. The behaviour concerning font selection depends on the header mode. In all cases, the given font size is used for the calculation of proper spacing. When not using the <b>standalone</b> mode the actual LaTeX font and font size at the point of inclusion is taken, so use LaTeX commands for changing fonts. If you use e.g. 12pt as font size for your LaTeX document, use '<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> 12' as options. The font name is ignored. If using <b>standalone</b> the given font and font size are used, see below for a detailed description. </p>
<p> If text is printed coloured is controlled by the TeX booleans  <span class="MATH">\</span>ifGPcolor and  <span class="MATH">\</span>ifGPblacktext. Only if  <span class="MATH">\</span>ifGPcolor is true and  <span class="MATH">\</span>ifGPblacktext is false, text is printed coloured. You may either change them in the generated TeX file or provide them globally in your TeX file, for example by using  </p>
<pre>
\newif\ifGPblacktext
\GPblacktexttrue</pre>  in the preamble of your document. The local assignment is only done if no global value is given. <p> When using the epslatex terminal give the name of the TeX file in the <b>set output</b> command including the file extension (normally <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>.tex<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>). The eps filename is generated by replacing the extension by <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>.eps<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> If using the <b>standalone</b> mode a complete LaTeX header is added to the LaTeX file; and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>-inc<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is added to the filename of the eps file. The <b>standalone</b> mode generates a TeX file that produces output with the correct size when using dvips, pdfTeX, or VTeX. The default, <b>input</b>, generates a file that has to be included into a LaTeX document using the  <span class="MATH">\</span>input command. </p>
<p> If a font other than <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>default<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is given it is interpreted as LaTeX font name. It contains up to three parts, separated by a comma: 'fontname,fontseries,fontshape'. If the default fontshape or fontseries are requested, they can be omitted. Thus, the real syntax for the fontname is '[fontname][,fontseries][,fontshape]'. The naming convention for all parts is given by the LaTeX font scheme. The fontname is 3 to 4 characters long and is built as follows: One character for the font vendor, two characters for the name of the font, and optionally one additional character for special fonts, e.g., 'j' for fonts with old-style numerals or 'x' for expert fonts. The names of many fonts is described in <a href="http://www.tug.org/fontname/fontname.pdf"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.tug.org/fontname/fontname.pdf </span></a> </p>
<p> For example, 'cmr' stands for Computer Modern Roman, 'ptm' for Times-Roman, and 'phv' for Helvetica. The font series denotes the thickness of the glyphs, in most cases 'm' for normal (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>medium<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>) and 'bx' or 'b' for bold fonts. The font shape is 'n' for upright, 'it' for italics, 'sl' for slanted, or 'sc' for small caps, in general. Some fonts may provide different font series or shapes. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> Use Times-Roman boldface (with the same shape as in the surrounding text):  </p>
<pre>
set terminal epslatex 'ptm,bx'</pre>  Use Helvetica, boldface, italics:  <pre>
set terminal epslatex 'phv,bx,it'</pre>  Continue to use the surrounding font in slanted shape:  <pre>
set terminal epslatex ',,sl'</pre>  Use small capitals:  <pre>
set terminal epslatex ',,sc'</pre>  <p> By this method, only text fonts are changed. If you also want to change the math fonts you have to use the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>gnuplot.cfg<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> file or the <b>header</b> option, described below. </p>
<p> In standalone mode, the font size is taken from the given font size in the <b>set terminal</b> command. To be able to use a specified font size, a file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>size<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>size<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>.clo<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> has to reside in the LaTeX search path. By default, 10pt, 11pt, and 12pt are supported. If the package <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>extsizes<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is installed, 8pt, 9pt, 14pt, 17pt, and 20pt are added. </p>
<p> The <b>header</b> option takes a string as argument. This string is written into the generated LaTeX file. If using the <b>standalone</b> mode, it is written into the preamble, directly before the  <span class="MATH">\</span>begin{document} command. In the <b>input</b> mode, it is placed directly after the  <span class="MATH">\</span>begingroup command to ensure that all settings are local to the plot. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> Use T1 fontencoding, change the text and math font to Times-Roman as well as the sans-serif font to Helvetica:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal epslatex standalone header \
"\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage{mathptmx}\n\\usepackage{helvet}"</pre>  Use a boldface font in the plot, not influencing the text outside the plot:  <pre>

To save the current plot to a file, left click in the display window and choose <b>save</b>. <p> <b>transparent</b> instructs the driver to make the background color transparent. Default is <b>notransparent</b>. </p>
<p> The <b>linewidth</b> and <b>dashlength</b> options are scaling factors that affect all lines drawn, i.e. they are multiplied by values requested in various drawing commands. </p>
<p> <b>butt</b> instructs the driver to use a line drawing method that does not overshoot the desired end point of a line. This setting is only applicable for line widths greater than 1. This setting is most useful when drawing horizontal or vertical lines. Default is <b>rounded</b>. </p>
<p> The output plot size <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>x,y<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is given in pixels — it defaults to 640x480. Please see additional information under <b><a href="canvas_size.html#canvas">canvas</a></b> and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_size">set size</a></b>. Blank space at the edges of the finished plot may be trimmed using the <b>crop</b> option, resulting in a smaller final image size. Default is <b>nocrop</b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION050124100000000000000">Animate</h3>   <pre>
set term gif animate {delay &lt;d&gt;} {loop &lt;n&gt;} {{no}optimize}}</pre>  <p> The gif terminal <b>animate</b> option creates a single gif file containing multiple frames. The delay between display of successive frames may be specified in units of 1/100 second (default 5), but this value may or may not be honored accurately by a program used to view the animation later. The number of animation loops during playback can be specified, with the default of 0 meaning unlimited looping. Again this value may or may not be honored by the program later used for viewing. An animation sequence is terminated by the next <b>set output</b> or <b>set term</b> command. </p>
<p> The <b>optimize</b> option [DEPRECATED] is passed to the gd library when the output file is opened. It has two effects on the animation. </p>
<p> 1) A single color map is used for the entire animation. This requires that all colors used in any frame of the animation are already defined in the first frame. </p>
<p> 2) If possible, only the portions of a frame that differ from the previous frame are stored in the animation file. This space saving may not be possible if the animation uses transparency. </p>
<p> Both of these optimizations are intended to produce a smaller output file, but the decrease in size is probably only significant for long animations. Caveat: The implementation of optimization in libgd is known to be buggy. Therefore use of this option in gnuplot is not recommended. </p>

<pre>
gpic filename.pic | geqn -d@@ -Tps | groff -m[macro-package] -Tps
    &gt; filename.ps</pre>  <p> Figures made this way can be scaled to fit into a document. The pic language is easy to understand, so the graphs can be edited by hand if need be. All co-ordinates in the pic-file produced by <b>gnuplot</b> are given as x+gnuplotx and y+gnuploty. By default x and y are given the value 0. If this line is removed with an editor in a number of files, one can put several graphs in one figure like this (default size is 5.0x3.0 inches): </p>

The latex, emtex, eepic, and tpic terminals in older versions of gnuplot provided minimal support for graphics styles beyond simple lines and points. They have been directly superseded by the <b>pict2e</b> terminal. For more capable TeX/LaTeX compatible terminal types see <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#cairolatex">cairolatex</a></b>, <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#context">context</a></b>, <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#epslatex">epslatex</a></b>, <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#mp">mp</a></b>, <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#pstricks">pstricks</a></b>, and <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#tikz">tikz</a></b>. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>

             {size &lt;XX&gt;{unit}, &lt;YY&gt;{unit}} {rotate | norotate}
             {color | monochrome}</pre>  <p> By default the plot will inherit font settings from the embedding document. You have the option of forcing either Courier (cmtt) or Roman (cmr) fonts instead. In this case you may also specify a fontsize. Unless your driver is capable of building fonts at any size (e.g. dvips), stick to the standard 10, 11 and 12 point sizes. </p>
<p> METAFONT users beware: METAFONT does not like odd sizes. </p>
<p> All drivers for LaTeX offer a special way of controlling text positioning: If any text string begins with '{', you also need to include a '}' at the end of the text, and the whole text will be centered both horizontally and vertically. If the text string begins with '[', you need to follow this with a position specification (up to two out of t,b,l,r), ']{', the text itself, and finally '}'. The text itself may be anything LaTeX can typeset as an LR-box. ' <span class="MATH">\</span>rule{}{}'s may help for best positioning. </p>
<p> Points, among other things, are drawn using the LaTeX commands <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>Diamond<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>Box<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. These commands no longer belong to the LaTeX2e core; they are included in the latexsym package, which is part of the base distribution and thus part of any LaTeX implementation. Please do not forget to use this package. Other point types use symbols from the amssymb package. </p>
<p> The default size for the plot is 5 inches by 3 inches. The <b>size</b> option changes this to whatever the user requests. By default the X and Y sizes are taken to be in inches, but other units are possible (currently only cm). </p>
<p> If <b>rotate</b> is specified, rotated text, especially a rotated y-axis label, is possible (the packages graphics or graphicx are needed). The 'stacked' y-axis label mechanism is then deactivated. This will also significantly improve the quality of line drawing, and is default since version 5.3. </p>
<p> The option <b>color</b> enables color, while <b>monochrome</b> uses only black and white drawing elements. You need to load the color or xcolor package in the preamble of your latex document. </p>
<p> Examples: About label positioning: Use gnuplot defaults (mostly sensible, but sometimes not really best):  </p>
<pre>
set title '\LaTeX\ -- $ \gamma $'</pre>  Force centering both horizontally and vertically:  <pre>
set label '{\LaTeX\ -- $ \gamma $}' at 0,0</pre>  Specify own positioning (top here):  <pre>

These terminals have been deprecated. <p> The recommended way to run gnuplot from the linux console is now to use a console terminal emulator such as yaft (https://github.com/uobikiemukot/yaft) that supports sixel graphics. With yaft as your console terminal you can run gnuplot and select a terminal with sixel output. See <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#sixelgd">sixelgd</a></b>. As a fall-back option you could use <b>set term dumb</b>, but sixel graphics are much nicer. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050138000000000000000">Lua</h2>  The <b>lua</b> generic terminal driver works in conjunction with an external Lua script to create a target-specific plot file. Currently the only supported target is TikZ -<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> pdflatex. <p> Information about Lua is available at http://www.lua.org . </p>
<p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>

If a 'target name' for the script is given, the terminal will look for <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>gnuplot-<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>target name<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>.lua<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> in the local directory and on failure in the environmental variable GNUPLOT_LUA_DIR. </p>
<p> All arguments will be provided to the selected script for further evaluation. E.g. 'set term lua tikz help' will cause the script itself to print additional help on options and choices for the script. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050139000000000000000">Mf</h2>   The <b>mf</b> terminal driver creates an input file to the METAFONT program. Thus a figure may be used in the TeX document in the same way as is a character. <p> To use a picture in a document, the METAFONT program must be run with the output file from <b>gnuplot</b> as input. Thus, the user needs a basic knowledge of the font creating process and the procedure for including a new font in a document. However, if the METAFONT program is set up properly at the local site, an unexperienced user could perform the operation without much trouble. </p>
<p> The text support is based on a METAFONT character set. Currently the Computer Modern Roman font set is input, but the user is in principal free to choose whatever fonts he or she needs. The METAFONT source files for the chosen font must be available. Each character is stored in a separate picture variable in METAFONT. These variables may be manipulated (rotated, scaled etc.) when characters are needed. The drawback is the interpretation time in the METAFONT program. On some machines (i.e. PC) the limited amount of memory available may also cause problems if too many pictures are stored. </p>
<p> The <b>mf</b> terminal has no options. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION050139100000000000000">METAFONT Instructions</h3>  <p> - Set your terminal to METAFONT:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal mf</pre>  - Select an output-file, e.g.:  <pre>
set output "myfigures.mf"</pre>  - Create your pictures. Each picture will generate a separate character. Its default size will be 5*3 inches. You can change the size by saying <b>set size 0.5,0.5</b> or whatever fraction of the default size you want to have. <p> - Quit <b>gnuplot</b>. </p>
<p> - Generate a TFM and GF file by running METAFONT on the output of <b>gnuplot</b>. Since the picture is quite large (5*3 in), you will have to use a version of METAFONT that has a value of at least 150000 for memmax. On Unix systems these are conventionally installed under the name bigmf. For the following assume that the command virmf stands for a big version of METAFONT. For example: </p>
<p> - Invoke METAFONT:  </p>
<pre>
virmf '&amp;plain'</pre>  - Select the output device: At the METAFONT prompt ('*') type:  <pre>
\mode:=CanonCX;     % or whatever printer you use</pre>  - Optionally select a magnification:  <pre>
mag:=1;             % or whatever you wish</pre>  - Input the <b>gnuplot</b>-file:  <pre>
input myfigures.mf</pre>  On a typical Unix machine there will usually be a script called <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>mf<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> that executes virmf '&amp;plain', so you probably can substitute mf for virmf &amp;plain. This will generate two files: mfput.tfm and mfput.$$$gf (where $$$ indicates the resolution of your device). The above can be conveniently achieved by typing everything on the command line, e.g.: virmf '&amp;plain' ' <span class="MATH">\</span>mode:=CanonCX; mag:=1; input myfigures.mf' In this case the output files will be named myfigures.tfm and myfigures.300gf. <p> - Generate a PK file from the GF file using gftopk:  </p>
<pre>
gftopk myfigures.300gf myfigures.300pk</pre>  The name of the output file for gftopk depends on the DVI driver you use. Ask your local TeX administrator about the naming conventions. Next, either install the TFM and PK files in the appropriate directories, or set your environment variables properly. Usually this involves setting TEXFONTS to include the current directory and doing the same thing for the environment variable that your DVI driver uses (no standard name here...). This step is necessary so that TeX will find the font metric file and your DVI driver will find the PK file. <p> - To include your pictures in your document you have to tell TeX the font:  </p>
<pre>
\font\gnufigs=myfigures</pre>  Each picture you made is stored in a single character. The first picture is character 0, the second is character 1, and so on... After doing the above step, you can use the pictures just like any other characters. Therefore, to place pictures 1 and 2 centered in your document, all you have to do is:  <pre>
\centerline{\gnufigs\char0}
\centerline{\gnufigs\char1}</pre>  in plain TeX. For LaTeX you can, of course, use the picture environment and place the picture wherever you wish by using the  <span class="MATH">\</span>makebox and  <span class="MATH">\</span>put macros. <p> This conversion saves you a lot of time once you have generated the font; TeX handles the pictures as characters and uses minimal time to place them, and the documents you make change more often than the pictures do. It also saves a lot of TeX memory. One last advantage of using the METAFONT driver is that the DVI file really remains device independent, because no  <span class="MATH">\</span>special commands are used as in the eepic and tpic drivers. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050140000000000000000">Mif</h2>  Note: Legacy terminal. The <b>mif</b> terminal driver produces Frame Maker MIF format version 3.00. It plots in MIF Frames with the size 15*10 cm, and plot primitives with the same pen will be grouped in the same MIF group. Plot primitives in a <b>gnuplot</b> page will be plotted in a MIF Frame, and several MIF Frames are collected in one large MIF Frame. The MIF font used for text is <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Times<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. <p> Several options may be set in the MIF 3.00 driver. </p>
<p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal mif {color | colour | monochrome} {polyline | vectors}
                 {help | ?}</pre>  <p> <b>colour</b> plots lines with line types <span class="MATH">&gt;</span>= 0 in colour (MIF sep. 2–7) and <b>monochrome</b> plots all line types in black (MIF sep. 0). <b>polyline</b> plots curves as continuous curves and <b>vectors</b> plots curves as collections of vectors. <b>help</b> and <b>?</b> print online help on standard error output — both print a short description of the usage; <b>help</b> also lists the options. </p>
<p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
set term mif colour polylines    # defaults
set term mif                     # defaults
set term mif vectors
set term mif help</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION050141000000000000000">Mp</h2>   <p> The <b>mp</b> driver produces output intended to be input to the Metapost program. Running Metapost on the file creates EPS files containing the plots. By default, Metapost passes all text through TeX. This has the advantage of allowing essentially any TeX symbols in titles and labels. </p>
<p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set term mp {color | colour | monochrome}
            {solid | dashed}
            {notex | tex | latex}
            {magnification &lt;magsize&gt;}
            {psnfss | psnfss-version7 | nopsnfss}
            {prologues &lt;value&gt;}
            {a4paper}
            {amstex}
            {"&lt;fontname&gt; {,&lt;fontsize&gt;}"}</pre>  <p> The option <b>color</b> causes lines to be drawn in color (on a printer or display that supports it), <b>monochrome</b> (or nothing) selects black lines. The option <b>solid</b> draws solid lines, while <b>dashed</b> (or nothing) selects lines with different patterns of dashes. If <b>solid</b> is selected but <b>color</b> is not, nearly all lines will be identical. This may occasionally be useful, so it is allowed. </p>
<p> The option <b>notex</b> bypasses TeX entirely, therefore no TeX code can be used in labels under this option. This is intended for use on old plot files or files that make frequent use of common characters like <b>$</b> and <b>%</b> that require special handling in TeX. </p>
<p> The option <b>tex</b> sets the terminal to output its text for TeX to process. </p>
<p> The option <b>latex</b> sets the terminal to output its text for processing by LaTeX. This allows things like  <span class="MATH">\</span>frac for fractions which LaTeX knows about but TeX does not. Note that you must set the environment variable TEX to the name of your LaTeX executable (normally latex) if you use this option or use <b>mpost –tex=<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>name of LaTeX executable<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> ...</b>. Otherwise metapost will try and use TeX to process the text and it won't work. </p>
<p> Changing font sizes in TeX has no effect on the size of mathematics, and there is no foolproof way to make such a change, except by globally setting a magnification factor. This is the purpose of the <b>magnification</b> option. It must be followed by a scaling factor. All text (NOT the graphs) will be scaled by this factor. Use this if you have math that you want at some size other than the default 10pt. Unfortunately, all math will be the same size, but see the discussion below on editing the MP output. <b>mag</b> will also work under <b>notex</b> but there seems no point in using it as the font size option (below) works as well. </p>
<p> The option <b>psnfss</b> uses postscript fonts in combination with LaTeX. Since this option only makes sense, if LaTeX is being used, the <b>latex</b> option is selected automatically. This option includes the following packages for LaTeX: inputenc(latin1), fontenc(T1), mathptmx, helvet(scaled=09.2), courier, latexsym and textcomp. </p>
<p> The option <b>psnfss-version7</b> uses also postscript fonts in LaTeX (option <b>latex</b> is also automatically selected), but uses the following packages with LaTeX: inputenc(latin1), fontenc(T1), times, mathptmx, helvet and courier. </p>
<p> The option <b>nopsnfss</b> is the default and uses the standard font (cmr10 if not otherwise specified). </p>
<p> The option <b>prologues</b> takes a value as an additional argument and adds the line <b>prologues:=<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>value<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> to the metapost file. If a value of <b>2</b> is specified metapost uses postscript fonts to generate the eps-file, so that the result can be viewed using e.g. ghostscript. Normally the output of metapost uses TeX fonts and therefore has to be included in a (La)TeX file before you can look at it. </p>
<p> The option <b>noprologues</b> is the default. No additional line specifying the prologue will be added. </p>
<p> The option <b>a4paper</b> adds a <b>[a4paper]</b> to the documentclass. Normally letter paper is used (default). Since this option is only used in case of LaTeX, the <b>latex</b> option is selected automatically. </p>
<p> The option <b>amstex</b> automatically selects the <b>latex</b> option and includes the following LaTeX packages: amsfonts, amsmath(intlimits). By default these packages are not included. </p>
<p> A name in quotes selects the font that will be used when no explicit font is given in a <b>set label</b> or <b>set title</b>. A name recognized by TeX (a TFM file exists) must be used. The default is <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>cmr10<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> unless <b>notex</b> is selected, then it is <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pcrr8r<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> (Courier). Even under <b>notex</b>, a TFM file is needed by Metapost. The file <b>pcrr8r.tfm</b> is the name given to Courier in LaTeX's psnfss package. If you change the font from the <b>notex</b> default, choose a font that matches the ASCII encoding at least in the range 32-126. <b>cmtt10</b> almost works, but it has a nonblank character in position 32 (space). </p>
<p> The size can be any number between 5.0 and 99.99. If it is omitted, 10.0 is used. It is advisable to use <b>magstep</b> sizes: 10 times an integer or half-integer power of 1.2, rounded to two decimals, because those are the most available sizes of fonts in TeX systems. </p>
<p> All the options are optional. If font information is given, it must be at the end, with size (if present) last. The size is needed to select a size for the font, even if the font name includes size information. For example, <b>set term mp <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>cmtt12<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b> selects cmtt12 shrunk to the default size 10. This is probably not what you want or you would have used cmtt10. </p>
<p> The following common ascii characters need special treatment in TeX:  </p>
<pre>
$, &amp;, #, %, _;  |, &lt;, &gt;;  ^, ~,  \, {, and }</pre>  The five characters $, #, &amp;, _, and % can simply be escaped, e.g., <b> <span class="MATH">\</span>$</b>. The three characters <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, and <span class="MATH">|</span> can be wrapped in math mode, e.g., <b>$<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>$</b>. The remainder require some TeX work-arounds. Any good book on TeX will give some guidance. <p> If you type your labels inside double quotes, backslashes in TeX code need to be escaped (doubled). Using single quotes will avoid having to do this, but then you cannot use <b> <span class="MATH">\</span>n</b> for line breaks. As of this writing, version 3.7 of gnuplot processes titles given in a <b>plot</b> command differently than in other places, and backslashes in TeX commands need to be doubled regardless of the style of quotes. </p>
<p> Metapost pictures are typically used in TeX documents. Metapost deals with fonts pretty much the same way TeX does, which is different from most other document preparation programs. If the picture is included in a LaTeX document using the graphics package, or in a plainTeX document via epsf.tex, and then converted to PostScript with dvips (or other dvi-to-ps converter), the text in the plot will usually be handled correctly. However, the text may not appear if you send the Metapost output as-is to a PostScript interpreter. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION050141100000000000000">Metapost Instructions</h3>  <p> - Set your terminal to Metapost, e.g.:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal mp mono "cmtt12" 12</pre>  <p> - Select an output-file, e.g.:  </p>
<pre>
set output "figure.mp"</pre>  <p> - Create your pictures. Each plot (or multiplot group) will generate a separate Metapost beginfig...endfig group. Its default size will be 5 by 3 inches. You can change the size by saying <b>set size 0.5,0.5</b> or whatever fraction of the default size you want to have. </p>
<p> - Quit gnuplot. </p>
<p> - Generate EPS files by running Metapost on the output of gnuplot:  </p>
<pre>
mpost figure.mp  OR  mp figure.mp</pre>  The name of the Metapost program depends on the system, typically <b>mpost</b> for a Unix machine and <b>mp</b> on many others. Metapost will generate one EPS file for each picture. <p> - To include your pictures in your document you can use the graphics package in LaTeX or epsf.tex in plainTeX:  </p>
<pre>
\usepackage{graphics} % LaTeX
\input epsf.tex       % plainTeX</pre>  If you use a driver other than dvips for converting TeX DVI output to PS, you may need to add the following line in your LaTeX document:  <pre>
\DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{eps}{*}{}</pre>  Each picture you made is in a separate file. The first picture is in, e.g., figure.0, the second in figure.1, and so on.... To place the third picture in your document, for example, all you have to do is:  <pre>
\includegraphics{figure.2} % LaTeX
\epsfbox{figure.2}         % plainTeX</pre>  <p> The advantage, if any, of the mp terminal over a postscript terminal is editable output. Considerable effort went into making this output as clean as possible. For those knowledgeable in the Metapost language, the default line types and colors can be changed by editing the arrays <b>lt[]</b> and <b>col[]</b>. The choice of solid vs dashed lines, and color vs black lines can be change by changing the values assigned to the booleans <b>dashedlines</b> and <b>colorlines</b>. If the default <b>tex</b> option was in effect, global changes to the text of labels can be achieved by editing the <b>vebatimtex...etex</b> block. In particular, a LaTeX preamble can be added if desired, and then LaTeX's built-in size changing commands can be used for maximum flexibility. Be sure to set the appropriate MP configuration variable to force Metapost to run LaTeX instead of plainTeX. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050142000000000000000">Pbm</h2>  Note: only available if gnuplot is configured –with-bitmap-terminals. Syntax:  <pre>

The default plot size is 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high. The output size is white-space padded to the nearest multiple of 8 pixels on both x and y. This empty space may be cropped later if needed. </p>
<p> The output of the <b>pbm</b> driver depends upon <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>mode<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>: <b>monochrome</b> produces a portable bitmap (one bit per pixel), <b>gray</b> a portable graymap (three bits per pixel) and <b>color</b> a portable pixmap (color, four bits per pixel). </p>
<p> The output of this driver can be used with various image conversion and manipulation utilities provided by NETPBM.

You can also explicitly specify the canvas size using the <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> options. Default unit is <b>in</b>. Default size is <b>letter</b>. </p>
<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fontname<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> can be one of stick, univers (default), albertus, antique_olive, arial, avant_garde_gothic, bookman, zapf_chancery, clarendon, coronet, courier courier_ps, cg_times, garamond_antigua, helvetica, helvetica_narrow, letter_gothic, marigold, new_century_schlbk, cg_omega, palatino, times_new_roman, times_roman, zapf_dingbats, truetype_symbols, or wingdings. Font names are case-insensitive and underscores may be replaced by spaces or dashes or may be left out. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fontsize<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is the font size in points. </p>
<p> The point type selection can be the a limited default set by specifying <b>nopspoints</b>, or the same set of point types as provided by the postscript terminal by specifying <b>pspoints</b> (default). </p>
<p> The <b>butt</b> option selects lines with butt ends and mitered joins (default), whereas <b>rounded</b> selects rounded line ends and joins. </p>
<p> Line widths, and point and font sizes can be scaled using the <b>linewidth</b>, <b>pointscale</b>, or <b>fontscale</b> options, respectively. <b>color</b> selects the number of pens <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>number_of_pens<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> used in plots. Default is 8, minimum 2. </p>
<p> Note that built-in support of some of these options is printer device dependent. For instance, all the fonts are supposedly supported by the HP Laserjet IV, but only a few (e.g. univers, stick) may be supported by the HP Laserjet III and the Designjet 750C. Also, color obviously won't work on monochrome devices, but newer ones will do grey-scale. </p>
<p> Defaults: landscape, a4, 8 pens, univers, 12 point, pspoints, butt, no scaling </p>
<p> The <b>pcl5</b> terminal will try to request fonts which match your <b>encoding</b>. Note that this has highest priority, so you might end up with a different font face. The terminal's default <b>encoding</b> is <b>HP Roman-8</b>. </p>
<p> Limitations: </p>
<p> This terminal does not support alpha transparency. Transparent filling is emulated using shading patterns. Boxed text is not implemented. </p>
<p> The support for UTF-8 is limited. Lacking the label mode for UTF-8 output in HP-GL/2, the driver reverts to PCL for strings containing 8bit characters. UTF-8 text is limited to angles of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. Also vertical alignment might be off depending on the font. </p>
<p> Some enhanced text features (phantom box, overprinting) require using PCL features in addition to HP-GL/2. This conforms to the specs but may not work with your printer or software. </p>

The enhanced text mode syntax is shared with other gnuplot terminal types. See <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced">enhanced</a></b> for more details. </p>
<p> The width of all lines in the plot can be modified by the factor <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>lw<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> specified in <b>linewidth</b>. The default linewidth is 0.5 points. (1 <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>PostScript<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> point = 1/72 inch = 0.353 mm) </p>
<p> <b>rounded</b> sets line caps and line joins to be rounded; <b>butt</b> is the default, butt caps and mitered joins. </p>
<p> The default size for the output is 5 inches x 3 inches. The <b>size</b> option changes this to whatever the user requests. By default the X and Y sizes are taken to be in inches, but other units are possible (currently only cm). Screen coordinates always run from 0.0 to 1.0 along the full length of the plot edges as specified by the <b>size</b> option. </p>
<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>font<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is in the format <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>FontFace,FontSize<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, i.e. the face and the size comma-separated in a single string. FontFace is a usual font face name, such as 'Arial'. If you do not provide FontFace, the pdfcairo terminal will use 'Sans'. FontSize is the font size, in points. If you do not provide it, the pdfcairo terminal will use a nominal font size of 12 points. However, the default fontscale parameter for this terminal is 0.5, so the apparent font size is smaller than this if the pdf output is viewed at full size.  </p>
<pre>
For example :
   set term pdfcairo font "Arial,12"
   set term pdfcairo font "Arial" # to change the font face only
   set term pdfcairo font ",12" # to change the font size only
   set term pdfcairo font "" # to reset the font name and size</pre>  <p> The fonts are retrieved from the usual fonts subsystems. Under Windows, those fonts are to be found and configured in the entry <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Fonts<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> of the control panel. Under UNIX, they are handled by <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>fontconfig<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> Pango, the library used to layout the text, is based on utf-8. Thus, the pdfcairo terminal has to convert from your encoding to utf-8. The default input encoding is based on your 'locale'. If you want to use another encoding, make sure gnuplot knows which one you are using. See <b><a href="set_show.html#encoding">encoding</a></b> for more details. </p>
<p> Pango may give unexpected results with fonts that do not respect the unicode mapping. With the Symbol font, for example, the pdfcairo terminal will use the map provided by http://www.unicode.org/ to translate character codes to unicode. Note that <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>the Symbol font<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is to be understood as the Adobe Symbol font, distributed with Acrobat Reader as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>SY______.PFB<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. Alternatively, the OpenSymbol font, distributed with OpenOffice.org as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>opens___.ttf<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, offers the same characters. Microsoft has distributed a Symbol font (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>symbol.ttf<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>), but it has a different character set with several missing or moved mathematic characters. If you experience problems with your default setup (if the demo enhancedtext.dem is not displayed properly for example), you probably have to install one of the Adobe or OpenOffice Symbol fonts, and remove the Microsoft one. Other non-conform fonts, such as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>wingdings<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> have been observed working. </p>
<p> The rendering of the plot cannot be altered yet. To obtain the best output possible, the rendering involves two mechanisms : antialiasing and oversampling. Antialiasing allows to display non-horizontal and non-vertical lines smoother. Oversampling combined with antialiasing provides subpixel accuracy, so that gnuplot can draw a line from non-integer coordinates. This avoids wobbling effects on diagonal lines ('plot x' for example). </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050146000000000000000">Pict2e</h2>  The <b>pict2e</b> terminal uses the LaTeX2e variant of the picture environment. It replaces terminals which were based on the original LaTeX picture environment: <b>latex</b>, <b>emtex</b>, <b>tpic</b>, and <b>eepic</b>. (EXPERIMENTAL) <p> Alternatives to this terminal with a more complete support of gnuplot's features are <b>tikz</b>, <b>pstricks</b>, <b>cairolatex</b>, <b>pslatex</b>, <b>epslatex</b> and <b>mp</b>. </p>
<p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal pict2e
             {font "{&lt;fontname&gt;}{,&lt;fontsize&gt;}"}
             {size &lt;XX&gt;{unit}, &lt;YY&gt;{unit}}
             {color | monochrome}
             {linewidth &lt;lw&gt;} {rounded | butt}
             {texarrows | gparrows} {texpoints | gppoints}
             {smallpoints | tinypoints | normalpoints}</pre>  <p> This terminal requires the following standard LaTeX packages: <b>pict2e</b>, <b>xcolor</b>, <b>graphics</b>/<b>graphicx</b> and <b>amssymb</b>. For pdflatex, the <b>transparent</b> package is used to support transparency. </p>
<p> By default the plot will inherit font settings from the embedding document. You have the option to force a font with the <b>font</b> option, like cmtt (Courier) or cmr (Roman), instead. In this case you may also force a specific fontsize. Otherwise the fontsize argument is used to estimate the required space for text. Unless your driver is capable of building fonts at any size (e.g. dvips), stick to the standard 10, 11 and 12 point sizes. </p>
<p> The default size for the plot is 5 inches by 3 inches. The <b>size</b> option changes this to whatever the user requests. By default the X and Y sizes are taken to be in inches, but other units are possible (currently only cm). </p>
<p> With <b>texpoints</b>, points are drawn using LaTeX commands like <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>Diamond<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>Box<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. These are provided by the the latexsym package, which is part of the base distribution and thus part of any LaTeX implementation. Other point types use symbols from the amssymb package. With <b>gppoints</b>, the terminal will use gnuplot's internal routines for drawing point symbols instead. </p>
<p> With the <b>texpoints</b> option, you can select three different point sizes: <b>normalpoints</b>, <b>smallpoints</b>, and <b>tinypoints</b>. </p>
<p> <b>color</b> causes gnuplot to produce  <span class="MATH">\</span>color{...} commands so that the graphs are colored. Using this option, you must include  <span class="MATH">\</span>usepackage{xcolor} in the preamble of your LaTeX document. <b>monochrome</b> will avoid the use of any color commands in the output. Transparent color fill is available if pdflatex is used. </p>
<p> <b>linewidth</b> sets the scale factor for the width of lines. <b>rounded</b> sets line caps and line joins to be rounded. <b>butt</b> sets butt caps and mitered joins and is the default. </p>
<p> <b>pict2e</b> only supports dotted lines, but not dashed lines. All default line types are solid. Use <b>set linetype</b> with the <b>dashtype</b> property to change. </p>
<p> <b>texarrows</b> draws <b>arrow</b>s using LaTeX commands which are shorter but do not offer all options. <b>gparrows</b> selects drawing arrows using gnuplot's own routine for full functionality instead. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050147000000000000000">Pm</h2>  The <b>pm</b> terminal driver provides an OS/2 Presentation Manager window in which the graph is plotted. The window is opened when the first graph is plotted. This window has its own online help as well as facilities for printing and copying to the clipboard. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>

                     {{title} "title"}</pre>  <p> If <b>persist</b> is specified, each graph appears in its own window and all windows remain open after <b>gnuplot</b> exits. If <b>server</b> is specified, all graphs appear in the same window, which remains open when <b>gnuplot</b> exits. This option takes an optional numerical argument which specifies an instance of the server process. Thus multiple server windows can be in use at the same time. </p>
<p> If <b>widelines</b> is specified, all plots will be drawn with wide lines. If <b>enhanced</b> is specified, sub- and superscripts and multiple fonts are enabled (see <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced_text">enhanced text</a></b> for details). Font names for the core PostScript fonts may be abbreviated to a single letter (T/H/C/S for Times/Helvetica/Courier/Symbol). </p>
<p> <b>linewidth</b>, <b>fontscale</b>, <b>pointscale</b> can be used to scale the width of lines, the size of text, or the size of the point symbols. </p>
<p> If <b>title</b> is specified, it will be used as the title of the plot window. It will also be used as the name of the server instance, and will override the optional numerical argument. </p>
<p> The gnuplot outboard driver, gnupmdrv.exe, is searched in the same directory as gnuplot itself. You can override that by defining one of the environment variables GNUPLOT_DRIVER_DIR or GNUPLOT. As a last resort the current directory and the PATH are tried to locate gnupmdrv.exe. </p>

<pre>
set term png
set output '| display png:-'</pre>  You can view the output from successive plot commands interactively by typing <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>space<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> in the display window. To save the current plot to a file, left click in the display window and choose <b>save</b>. <p> <b>transparent</b> instructs the driver to make the background color transparent. Default is <b>notransparent</b>. </p>
<p> <b>interlace</b> instructs the driver to generate interlaced PNGs. Default is <b>nointerlace</b>. </p>
<p> The <b>linewidth</b> and <b>dashlength</b> options are scaling factors that affect all lines drawn, i.e. they are multiplied by values requested in various drawing commands. </p>
<p> By default output png images use 256 indexed colors. The <b>truecolor</b> option instead creates TrueColor images with 24 bits of color information per pixel. Transparent fill styles require the <b>truecolor</b> option. See <b><a href="set_show.html#fillstyle">fillstyle</a></b>. A transparent background is possible in either indexed or TrueColor images. </p>
<p> <b>butt</b> instructs the driver to use a line drawing method that does not overshoot the desired end point of a line. This setting is only applicable for line widths greater than 1. This setting is most useful when drawing horizontal or vertical lines. Default is <b>rounded</b>. </p>
<p> The details of font selection are complicated. Two equivalent simple examples are given below:  </p>
<pre>

<p> The width of all lines in the plot can be modified by the factor <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>lw<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. </p>
<p> <b>rounded</b> sets line caps and line joins to be rounded; <b>butt</b> is the default, butt caps and mitered joins. </p>
<p> The default size for the output is 640 x 480 pixels. The <b>size</b> option changes this to whatever the user requests. By default the X and Y sizes are taken to be in pixels, but other units are possible (currently cm and inch). A size given in centimeters or inches will be converted into pixels assuming a resolution of 72 dpi. Screen coordinates always run from 0.0 to 1.0 along the full length of the plot edges as specified by the <b>size</b> option. </p>
<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>font<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is in the format <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>FontFace,FontSize<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, i.e. the face and the size comma-separated in a single string.

"Can't find PostScript prologue file ... "</pre>  Please see and follow the instructions in <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#postscript_prologue">postscript prologue</a></b>. <p> <b>landscape</b> and <b>portrait</b> choose the plot orientation. <b>eps</b> mode generates EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) output, which is just regular PostScript with some additional lines that allow the file to be imported into a variety of other applications. (The added lines are PostScript comment lines, so the file may still be printed by itself.) To get EPS output, use the <b>eps</b> mode and make only one plot per file. In <b>eps</b> mode the whole plot, including the fonts, is reduced to half of the default size. </p>
<p> <b>enhanced</b> enables enhanced text mode features (subscripts, superscripts and mixed fonts). See <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced">enhanced</a></b> for more information. <b>blacktext</b> forces all text to be written in black even in color mode; </p>
<p> Duplexing in PostScript is the ability of the printer to print on both sides of the same sheet of paper. With <b>defaultplex</b>, the default setting of the printer is used; with <b>simplex</b> only one side is printed; <b>duplex</b> prints on both sides (ignored if your printer can't do it). </p>
<p> <b><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fontname<span class="MATH">&gt;</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b> is the name of a valid PostScript font; and <b><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fontsize<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> is the size of the font in PostScript points. In addition to the standard postscript fonts, an oblique version of the Symbol font, useful for mathematics, is defined. It is called <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Symbol-Oblique<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> <b>default</b> sets all options to their defaults: <b>landscape</b>, <b>monochrome</b>, <b>dl 1.0</b>, <b>lw 1.0</b>, <b>defaultplex</b>, <b>enhanced</b>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Helvetica<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and 14pt. Default size of a PostScript plot is 10 inches wide and 7 inches high. The option <b>color</b> enables color, while <b>monochrome</b> prefers black and white drawing elements. Further, <b>monochrome</b> uses gray <b>palette</b> but it does not change color of objects specified with an explicit <b>colorspec</b>. <b>dashlength</b> or <b>dl</b> scales the length of dashed-line segments by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>DL<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, which is a floating-point number greater than zero. <b>linewidth</b> or <b>lw</b> scales all linewidths by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>LW<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. </p>
<p> By default the generated PostScript code uses language features that were introduced in PostScript Level 2, notably filters and pattern-fill of irregular objects such as filledcurves. PostScript Level 2 features are conditionally protected so that PostScript Level 1 interpreters do not issue errors but, rather, display a message or a PostScript Level 1 approximation. The <b>level1</b> option substitutes PostScript Level 1 approximations of these features and uses no PostScript Level 2 code. This may be required by some old printers and old versions of Adobe Illustrator. The flag <b>level1</b> can be toggled later by editing a single line in the PostScript output file to force PostScript Level 1 interpretation. In the case of files containing level 2 code, the above features will not appear or will be replaced by a note when this flag is set or when the interpreting program does not indicate that it understands level 2 PostScript or higher. The flag <b>level3</b> enables PNG encoding for bitmapped images, which can reduce the output size considerably. </p>
<p> <b>rounded</b> sets line caps and line joins to be rounded; <b>butt</b> is the default, butt caps and mitered joins. </p>
<p> <b>clip</b> tells PostScript to clip all output to the bounding box; <b>noclip</b> is the default. </p>
<p> <b>palfuncparam</b> controls how <b>set palette functions</b> are encoded as gradients in the output. Analytic color component functions (set via <b>set palette functions</b>) are encoded as linear interpolated gradients in the postscript output: The color component functions are sampled at <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>samples<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> points and all points are removed from this gradient which can be removed without changing the resulting colors by more than <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>maxdeviation<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. For almost every useful palette you may safely leave the defaults of <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>samples<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>=2000 and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>maxdeviation<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>=0.003 untouched. </p>
<p> The default size for postscript output is 10 inches x 7 inches. The default for eps output is 5 x 3.5 inches. The <b>size</b> option changes this to whatever the user requests. By default the X and Y sizes are taken to be in inches, but other units are possibly (currently only cm). The BoundingBox of the plot is correctly adjusted to contain the resized image. Screen coordinates always run from 0.0 to 1.0 along the full length of the plot edges as specified by the <b>size</b> option. NB: <b>this is a change from the previously recommended method of using the set size command prior to setting the terminal type</b>. The old method left the BoundingBox unchanged and screen coordinates did not correspond to the actual limits of the plot. </p>
<p> Fonts listed by <b>fontfile</b> or <b>fontfile add</b> encapsulate the font definitions of the listed font from a postscript Type 1 or TrueType font file directly into the gnuplot output postscript file. Thus, the enclosed font can be used in labels, titles, etc. See the section <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#postscript_fontfile">postscript fontfile</a></b> for more details. With <b>fontfile delete</b>, a fontfile is deleted from the list of embedded files. <b>nofontfiles</b> cleans the list of embedded fonts. </p>

These are <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>ps_symbols.gpi<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> (a <b>gnuplot</b> command file that, when executed, creates the file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>ps_symbols.ps<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> which shows all the symbols available through the <b>postscript</b> terminal), <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>ps_guide.ps<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> (a PostScript file that contains a summary of the enhanced syntax and a page showing what the octal codes produce with text and symbol fonts), <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>ps_file.doc<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> (a text file that contains a discussion of the organization of a PostScript file written by <b>gnuplot</b>), and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>ps_fontfile_doc.tex<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> (a LaTeX file which contains a short documentation concerning the encapsulation of LaTeX fonts with a glyph table of the math fonts). </p>
<p> A PostScript file is editable, so once <b>gnuplot</b> has created one, you are free to modify it to your heart's desire. See the <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#editing_postscript">editing postscript</a></b> section for some hints. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION050150100000000000000">Editing postscript</h3>  The PostScript language is a very complex language — far too complex to describe in any detail in this document. Nevertheless there are some things in a PostScript file written by <b>gnuplot</b> that can be changed without risk of introducing fatal errors into the file. <p> For example, the PostScript statement <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>/Color true def<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> (written into the file in response to the command <b>set terminal postscript color</b>), may be altered in an obvious way to generate a black-and-white version of a plot. Similarly line colors, text colors, line weights and symbol sizes can also be altered in straight-forward ways. Text (titles and labels) can be edited to correct misspellings or to change fonts. Anything can be repositioned, and of course anything can be added or deleted, but modifications such as these may require deeper knowledge of the PostScript language. </p>
<p> The organization of a PostScript file written by <b>gnuplot</b> is discussed in the text file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>ps_file.doc<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> in the docs/ps subdirectory of the gnuplot source distribution. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION050150200000000000000">Postscript fontfile</h3>   <pre>
set term postscript ... fontfile {add|delete} &lt;filename&gt;</pre>  The <b>fontfile</b> or <b>fontfile add</b> option takes one file name as argument and encapsulates this file into the postscript output in order to make this font available for text elements (labels, tic marks, titles, etc.). The <b>fontfile delete</b> option also takes one file name as argument. It deletes this file name from the list of encapsulated files. <p> The postscript terminal understands some font file formats: Type 1 fonts in ASCII file format (extension <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>.pfa<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>), Type 1 fonts in binary file format (extension <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>.pfb<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>), and TrueType fonts (extension <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>.ttf<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>). pfa files are understood directly, pfb and ttf files are converted on the fly if appropriate conversion tools are installed (see below). You have to specify the full filename including the extension. Each <b>fontfile</b> option takes exact one font file name. This option can be used multiple times in order to include more than one font file. </p>
<p> The search order used to find font files is (1) absolute pathname or current working directory (2) any of the directories specified by <b>set loadpath</b> (3) the directory specified by <b>set fontpath</b> (4) the directory given in environmental variable GNUPLOT_FONTPATH. NB: This is a CHANGE from earlier versions of gnuplot. </p>
<p> For using the encapsulated font file you have to specify the font name (which normally is not the same as the file name). When embedding a font file by using the <b>fontfile</b> option in interactive mode, the font name is printed on the screen. E.g.  </p>
<pre>
Font file 'p052004l.pfb' contains the font 'URWPalladioL-Bold'. Location:
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/URW/p052004l.pfb</pre>  <p> When using pfa or pfb fonts, you can also find it out by looking into the font file. There is a line similar to <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>/FontName /URWPalladioL-Bold def<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. The middle string without the slash is the fontname, here <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>URWPalladioL-Bold<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. For TrueType fonts, this is not so easy since the font name is stored in a binary format. In addition, they often have spaces in the font names which is not supported by Type 1 fonts (in which a TrueType is converted on the fly). The font names are changed in order to eliminate the spaces in the fontnames. The easiest way to find out which font name is generated for use with gnuplot, start gnuplot in interactive mode and type in <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>set terminal postscript fontfile '<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>filename.ttf<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>'<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> For converting font files (either ttf or pfb) to pfa format, the conversion tool has to read the font from a file and write it to standard output. If the output cannot be written to standard output, on-the-fly conversion is not possible. </p>
<p> For pfb files <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pfbtops<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is a tool which can do this. If this program is installed on your system the on the fly conversion should work. Just try to encapsulate a pfb file. If the compiled in program call does not work correctly you can specify how this program is called by defining the environment variable GNUPLOT_PFBTOPFA e.g. to <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pfbtops %s<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. The <b>%s</b> will be replaced by the font file name and thus has to exist in the string. </p>
<p> If you don't want to do the conversion on the fly but get a pfa file of the font you can use the tool <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pfb2pfa<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> which is written in simple c and should compile with any c compiler. It is available from many ftp servers, e.g. <a href="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/ps2mf/.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/ps2mf/ </span></a> </p>
<p> In fact, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pfbtopfa<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pfb2ps<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> do the same job. <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pfbtopfa<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> puts the resulting pfa code into a file, whereas <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pfbtops<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> writes it to standard output. </p>
<p> TrueType fonts are converted into Type 1 pfa format, e.g. by using the tool <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>ttf2pt1<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> which is available from <a href="http://ttf2pt1.sourceforge.net/"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://ttf2pt1.sourceforge.net/ </span></a> </p>
<p> If the builtin conversion does not work, the conversion command can be changed by the environment variable GNUPLOT_TTFTOPFA. For usage with ttf2pt1 it may be set to <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>ttf2pt1 -a -e -W 0 %s - <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. Here again, <b>%s</b> stands for the file name. </p>
<p> For special purposes you also can use a pipe (if available for your operating system). Therefore you start the file name definition with the character <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span class="MATH">&lt;</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and append a program call. This program has to write pfa data to standard output. Thus, a pfa file may be accessed by <b>set fontfile <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span class="MATH">&lt;</span> cat garamond.pfa<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b>. </p>
<p> For example, including Type 1 font files can be used for including the postscript output in LaTeX documents. The <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>european computer modern<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> font (which is a variant of the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>computer modern<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> font) is available in pfb format from any CTAN server, e.g. <a href="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super/.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super/ </span></a> </p>
<p> For example, the file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>sfrm1000.pfb<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> contains the normal upright fonts with serifs in the design size 10pt (font name <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>SFRM1000<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>). The computer modern fonts, which are still necessary for mathematics, are available from <a href="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky </span></a> </p>
<p> With these you can use any character available in TeX. However, the computer modern fonts have a strange encoding. (This is why you should not use cmr10.pfb for text, but sfrm1000.pfb instead.) The usage of TeX fonts is shown in one of the demos. The file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>ps_fontfile_doc.tex<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> in the /docs/psdoc subdirectory of the <b>gnuplot</b> source distribution contains a table with glyphs of the TeX mathfonts. </p>
<p> If the font <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>CMEX10<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is embedded (file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>cmex10.pfb<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>) gnuplot defines the additional font <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>CMEX10-Baseline<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. It is shifted vertically in order to fit better to the other glyphs (CMEX10 has its baseline at the top of the symbols). </p>
<h3 id="SECTION050150300000000000000">Postscript prologue</h3>  Each PostScript output file includes a %%Prolog section and possibly some additional user-defined sections containing, for example, character encodings. These sections are copied from a set of PostScript prologue files that are either compiled into the gnuplot executable or stored elsewhere on your computer. A default directory where these files live is set at the time gnuplot is built. However, you can override this default either by using the gnuplot command <b>set psdir</b> or by defining an environment variable GNUPLOT_PS_DIR. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_psdir">set psdir</a></b>. <h3 id="SECTION050150400000000000000">Postscript adobeglyphnames</h3>   This setting is only relevant to PostScript output with UTF-8 encoding. It controls the names used to describe characters with Unicode entry points higher than 0x00FF. That is, all characters outside of the Latin1 set. In general unicode characters do not have a unique name; they have only a unicode identification code. However, Adobe have a recommended scheme for assigning names to certain ranges of characters (extended Latin, Greek, etc). Some fonts use this scheme, others do not. By default, gnuplot will use the Adobe glyph names. E.g. the lower case Greek letter alpha will be called /alpha. If you specific <b>noadobeglyphnames</b> then instead gnuplot will use /uni03B1 to describe this character. If you get this setting wrong, the character may not be found even if it is present in the font. It is probably always correct to use the default for Adobe fonts, but for other fonts you may have to try both settings. See also <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#fontfile">fontfile</a></b>. <h2 id="SECTION050151000000000000000">Pslatex and pstex</h2>   The <b>pslatex</b> driver generates output for further processing by LaTeX, while the <b>pstex</b> driver generates output for further processing by TeX. <b>pslatex</b> uses  <span class="MATH">\</span>specials understandable by dvips and xdvi.

<pre>
"Can't find PostScript prologue file ... "</pre>  Please see and follow the instructions in <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#postscript_prologue">postscript prologue</a></b>. <p> The option <b>color</b> enables color, while <b>monochrome</b> prefers black and white drawing elements. Further, <b>monochrome</b> uses gray <b>palette</b> but it does not change color of objects specified with an explicit <b>colorspec</b>. <b>dashlength</b> or <b>dl</b> scales the length of dashed-line segments by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>DL<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, which is a floating-point number greater than zero. <b>linewidth</b> or <b>lw</b> scales all linewidths by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>LW<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. </p>
<p> By default the generated PostScript code uses language features that were introduced in PostScript Level 2, notably filters and pattern-fill of irregular objects such as filledcurves. PostScript Level 2 features are conditionally protected so that PostScript Level 1 interpreters do not issue errors but, rather, display a message or a PostScript Level 1 approximation. The <b>level1</b> option substitutes PostScript Level 1 approximations of these features and uses no PostScript Level 2 code. This may be required by some old printers and old versions of Adobe Illustrator. The flag <b>level1</b> can be toggled later by editing a single line in the PostScript output file to force PostScript Level 1 interpretation. In the case of files containing level 2 code, the above features will not appear or will be replaced by a note when this flag is set or when the interpreting program does not indicate that it understands level 2 PostScript or higher. The flag <b>level3</b> enables PNG encoding for bitmapped images, which can reduce the output size considerably. </p>
<p> <b>rounded</b> sets line caps and line joins to be rounded; <b>butt</b> is the default, butt caps and mitered joins. </p>
<p> <b>clip</b> tells PostScript to clip all output to the bounding box; <b>noclip</b> is the default. </p>
<p> <b>palfuncparam</b> controls how <b>set palette functions</b> are encoded as gradients in the output. Analytic color component functions (set via <b>set palette functions</b>) are encoded as linear interpolated gradients in the postscript output: The color component functions are sampled at <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>samples<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> points and all points are removed from this gradient which can be removed without changing the resulting colors by more than <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>maxdeviation<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. For almost every useful palette you may safely leave the defaults of <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>samples<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>=2000 and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>maxdeviation<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>=0.003 untouched. </p>
<p> The default size for postscript output is 10 inches x 7 inches. The default for eps output is 5 x 3.5 inches. The <b>size</b> option changes this to whatever the user requests. By default the X and Y sizes are taken to be in inches, but other units are possibly (currently only cm). The BoundingBox of the plot is correctly adjusted to contain the resized image. Screen coordinates always run from 0.0 to 1.0 along the full length of the plot edges as specified by the <b>size</b> option. NB: <b>this is a change from the previously recommended method of using the set size command prior to setting the terminal type</b>. The old method left the BoundingBox unchanged and screen coordinates did not correspond to the actual limits of the plot. </p>
<p> if <b>rotate</b> is specified, the y-axis label is rotated. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>font_size<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is the size (in pts) of the desired font. </p>
<p> If <b>auxfile</b> is specified, it directs the driver to put the PostScript commands into an auxiliary file instead of directly into the LaTeX file. This is useful if your pictures are large enough that dvips cannot handle them. The name of the auxiliary PostScript file is derived from the name of the TeX file given on the <b>set output</b> command; it is determined by replacing the trailing <b>.tex</b> (actually just the final extent in the file name) with <b>.ps</b> in the output file name, or, if the TeX file has no extension, <b>.ps</b> is appended. The <b>.ps</b> is included into the <b>.tex</b> file by a  <span class="MATH">\</span>special{psfile=...} command. Remember to close the <b>output file</b> before next plot unless in <b>multiplot</b> mode. </p>
<p> Gnuplot versions prior to version 4.2 generated plots of the size 5 x 3 inches using the ps(la)tex terminal while the current version generates 5 x 3.5 inches to be consistent with the postscript eps terminal. In addition, the character width is now estimated to be 60% of the font size while the old epslatex terminal used 50%. To reach the old format specify the option <b>oldstyle</b>. </p>
<p> The pslatex driver offers a special way of controlling text positioning: (a) If any text string begins with '{', you also need to include a '}' at the end of the text, and the whole text will be centered both horizontally and vertically by LaTeX. (b) If the text string begins with '[', you need to continue it with: a position specification (up to two out of t,b,l,r), ']{', the text itself, and finally, '}'. The text itself may be anything LaTeX can typeset as an LR-box.  <span class="MATH">\</span>rule{}{}'s may help for best positioning. </p>
<p> The options not described here are identical to the <b>Postscript terminal</b>. Look there if you want to know what they do. </p>
<p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
set term pslatex monochrome rotate       # set to defaults</pre>  To write the PostScript commands into the file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>foo.ps<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>:  <pre>
set term pslatex auxfile
set output "foo.tex"; plot ...; set output</pre>  About label positioning: Use gnuplot defaults (mostly sensible, but sometimes not really best):  <pre>
set title '\LaTeX\ -- $ \gamma $'</pre>  Force centering both horizontally and vertically:  <pre>
set label '{\LaTeX\ -- $ \gamma $}' at 0,0</pre>  Specify own positioning (top here):  <pre>
set xlabel '[t]{\LaTeX\ -- $ \gamma $}'</pre>  The other label – account for long ticlabels:  <pre>
set ylabel '[r]{\LaTeX\ -- $ \gamma $\rule{7mm}{0pt}}'</pre>  <p> Linewidths and pointsizes may be changed with <b>set style line</b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050152000000000000000">Pstricks</h2>  The <b>pstricks</b> driver is intended for use with the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pstricks.sty<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> macro package for LaTeX.

<p> <b>standalone</b> produces a LaTeX file with possibly multiple plots, ready to be compiled. The default is <b>input</b> to produce a TeX file which can be included. </p>
<p> <b>blacktext</b> forces all text to be written in black. <b>colortext</b> enables colored text. The default is <b>blacktext</b>. </p>
<p> <b>rounded</b> sets line caps and line joins to be rounded. <b>butt</b> sets butt caps and mitered joins and is the default. </p>
<p> <b>linewidth</b> and <b>pointscale</b> scale the width of lines and the size of point symbols, respectively. </p>
<p> <b>psarrows</b> draws <b>arrow</b>s using PSTricks commands which are shorter but do not offer all options. <b>gparrows</b> selects drawing arrows using gnuplot's own routine for full functionality instead. </p>
<p> The old <b>hacktext</b> option has been replaced by the new default format (%h), see <b><a href="set_show.html#format_specifiers">format specifiers</a></b>. </p>

<h2 id="SECTION050153000000000000000">Qms</h2>  The <b>qms</b> terminal driver supports the QMS/QUIC Laser printer, the Talaris 1200 and others. It has no options. <h2 id="SECTION050154000000000000000">Qt</h2>  The <b>qt</b> terminal device generates output in a separate window with the Qt library. Syntax:  <pre>

            {widget &lt;id&gt;}</pre>  <p> Multiple plot windows are supported: <b>set terminal qt <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> directs the output to plot window number n. </p>
<p> The default window title is based on the window number. This title can also be specified with the keyword <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>title<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> Plot windows remain open even when the <b>gnuplot</b> driver is changed to a different device. A plot window can be closed by pressing the letter 'q' while that window has input focus, by choosing <b>close</b> from a window manager menu, or with <b>set term qt <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> close</b>. </p>
<p> The size of the plot area is given in pixels, it defaults to 640x480. In addition to that, the actual size of the window also includes the space reserved for the toolbar and the status bar. When you resize a window, the plot is immediately scaled to fit in the new size of the window. The <b>qt</b> terminal scales the whole plot, including fonts and linewidths, and keeps its global aspect ratio constant. If you type <b>replot</b>, click the <b>replot</b> icon in the terminal toolbar or type a new <b>plot</b> command, the new plot will completely fit in the window and the font size and the linewidths will be reset to their defaults. </p>
<p> The position option can be used to set the position of the plot window. The position option only applies to the first plot after the <b>set term</b> command. </p>
<p> The active plot window (the one selected by <b>set term qt <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>) is interactive. Its behaviour is shared with other terminal types. See <b><a href="set_show.html#mouse">mouse</a></b> for details. It also has some extra icons, which are supposed to be self-explanatory. </p>
<p> This terminal supports an enhanced text mode, which allows font and other formatting commands (subscripts, superscripts, etc.) to be embedded in labels and other text strings. The enhanced text mode syntax is shared with other gnuplot terminal types. See <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced">enhanced</a></b> for more details. </p>
<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>font<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is in the format <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>FontFace,FontSize<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, i.e. the face and the size comma-separated in a single string. FontFace is a usual font face name, such as 'Arial'. If you do not provide FontFace, the qt terminal will use 'Sans'. FontSize is the font size, in points. If you do not provide it, the qt terminal will use a size of 9 points.  </p>
<pre>
For example :
   set term qt font "Arial,12"
   set term qt font "Arial" # to change the font face only
   set term qt font ",12" # to change the font size only
   set term qt font "" # to reset the font name and size</pre>  <p> The dashlength affects only custom dash patterns, not Qt's built-in set. </p>
<p> To obtain the best output possible, the rendering involves three mechanisms : antialiasing, oversampling and hinting. Oversampling combined with antialiasing provides subpixel accuracy, so that gnuplot can draw a line from non-integer coordinates. This avoids wobbling effects on diagonal lines ('plot x' for example). Hinting avoids the blur on horizontal and vertical lines caused by oversampling. The terminal will snap these lines to integer coordinates so that a one-pixel-wide line will actually be drawn on one and only one pixel. </p>
<p> By default, the window is raised to the top of your desktop when a plot is drawn. This can be controlled with the keyword <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>raise<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. The keyword <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>persist<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> will prevent gnuplot from exiting before you explicitly close all the plot windows. </p>
<p> The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>space<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> key raises the gnuplot console window [MS Windows only]. The 'q' key closes the plot window. These hot keys can be changed to ctrl-space and ctrl-q using the terminal option keyword <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>{no}ctrl<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. However the preferred way to select ctrl-q rather than 'q' is to use the toggle in the tools widget of the plot window. </p>
<p> The gnuplot outboard driver, gnuplot_qt, is searched in a default place chosen when the program is compiled. You can override that by defining the environment variable GNUPLOT_DRIVER_DIR. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050155000000000000000">Regis</h2>  Note: legacy terminal. The <b>regis</b> terminal device generates output in the REGIS graphics language. It has the option of using 4 (the default) or 16 colors. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal regis {4 | 16}</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION050156000000000000000">Sixelgd</h2>  Syntax:  <pre>
set terminal sixelgd
       {{no}enhanced} {{no}truecolor}
       {{no}transparent} {rounded|butt}
       {linewidth &lt;lw&gt;} {dashlength &lt;dl&gt;}

       {font "&lt;face&gt; {,&lt;pointsize&gt;}"} {fontscale &lt;scale&gt;}
       {size &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;} {{no}crop} {animate}
       {background &lt;rgb_color&gt;}</pre>  <p> The <b>sixel</b> output format was originally used by DEC terminals and printers. This driver produces a sixel output stream by converting a PNG image created internally using the gd library. The sixel output stream can be viewed in the terminal as it is created or it can be written to a file so that it can be replayed later by echoing the file to the terminal. </p>
<p> The <b>animate</b> option resets the cursor position to the terminal top left at the start of every plot so that successive plots overwrite the same area on the screen rather than having earlier plots scroll off the top. This may be desirable in order to create an in-place animation. </p>
<p> <b>transparent</b> instructs the driver to make the background color transparent. Default is <b>notransparent</b>. </p>
<p> The <b>linewidth</b> and <b>dashlength</b> options are scaling factors that affect all lines drawn, i.e. they are multiplied by values requested in various drawing commands. </p>
<p> By default the sixel output uses 16 indexed colors. The <b>truecolor</b> option instead creates a TrueColor png image that is mapped down onto 256 colors in the output sixel image. Transparent fill styles require the <b>truecolor</b> option. See <b><a href="set_show.html#fillstyle">fillstyle</a></b>. A <b>transparent</b> background is possible in either indexed or TrueColor images. </p>
<p> <b>butt</b> instructs the driver to use a line drawing method that does not overshoot the desired end point of a line. This setting is only applicable for line widths greater than 1. This setting is most useful when drawing horizontal or vertical lines. Default is <b>rounded</b>. </p>
<p> The details of font selection are complicated. For more information please see <b><a href="fonts.html#fonts">fonts</a></b>. </p>
<p> The output plot size <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>x,y<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is given in pixels — it defaults to 640x480. Please see additional information under <b><a href="canvas_size.html#canvas">canvas</a></b> and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_size">set size</a></b>. Blank space at the edges of the finished plot may be trimmed using the <b>crop</b> option, resulting in a smaller final image size. Default is <b>nocrop</b>. The terminal has been successfully tested with the xterm, mlterm and mintty terminals. The later two support the <b>truecolor</b> mode using 256 sixel colors out of box. Distributed copies of xterm may or may not have been configured to support sixel graphics and may be limited to 16 colors. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050157000000000000000">Svg</h2>  This terminal produces files in the W3C Scalable Vector Graphics format. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal svg {size &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt; {|fixed|dynamic}}
                 {mouse} {standalone | jsdir &lt;dirname&gt;}
                 {name &lt;plotname&gt;}
                 {font "&lt;fontname&gt;{,&lt;fontsize&gt;}"} {{no}enhanced}
                 {fontscale &lt;multiplier&gt;}
                 {rounded|butt|square} {solid|dashed} {linewidth &lt;lw&gt;}
                 {background &lt;rgb_color&gt;}</pre>  <p> where <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>x<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>y<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> are the size of the SVG plot to generate, <b>dynamic</b> allows a svg-viewer to resize plot, whereas the default setting, <b>fixed</b>, will request an absolute size. </p>
<p> <b>linewidth <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>w<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> increases the width of all lines used in the figure by a factor of <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>w<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. </p>
<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>font<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is the name of the default font to use (default Arial) and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fontsize<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is the font size (in points, default 12). SVG viewing programs may substitute other fonts when the file is displayed. </p>
<p> The enhanced text mode syntax is shared with other gnuplot terminal types. See <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced">enhanced</a></b> for more details. </p>
<p> The <b>mouse</b> option tells gnuplot to add support for mouse tracking and for toggling individual plots on/off by clicking on the corresponding key entry. By default this is done by including a link that points to a script in a local directory, usually /usr/local/share/gnuplot/<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>version<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>/js. You can change this by using the <b>jsdir</b> option to specify either a different local directory or a general URL. The latter is usually appropriate if you are embedding the svg into a web page. Alternatively, the <b>standalone</b> option embeds the mousing code in the svg document itself rather than linking to an external resource. </p>
<p> When an SVG file will be used in conjunction with external files, e.g. if it is referenced by javascript code in a web page or parent document, then a unique name is required to avoid potential conflicting references to other SVG plots. Use the <b>name</b> option to ensure uniqueness. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050158000000000000000">Svga</h2>  Legacy terminal. The <b>svga</b> terminal driver supports PCs with SVGA graphics. It is typically only compiled with DJGPP and uses the GRX graphics library. There is also a variant for Windows 32bit, which is mainly used for debugging. The underlying library also supports X11, Linux console and SDL, but these targets are currently not supported. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal svga {font "&lt;fontname&gt;"}
                  {{no}enhanced}
                  {background &lt;rgb color&gt;}
                  {linewidth|lw &lt;lw&gt;}
                  {pointscale|ps &lt;scale&gt;}
                  {fontscale|fs &lt;scale&gt;}</pre>  <p> Enhanced text support can be activated using the <b>enhanced</b> option, see <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced_text">enhanced text</a></b>. Note that changing the font size in enhanced text is currently not supported. Hence, super- and subscripts will have the same size. </p>
<p> The <b>linewidth</b> parameter scales the width of lines. The <b>pointscale</b> parameter sets the scale factor for point symbols. You can use <b>fontscale</b> to scale the bitmap font. This might be useful if you have a hi-res display. Note that integer factors give best results. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050159000000000000000">Tek40</h2>    This family of terminal drivers supports a variety of VT-like terminals. <b>tek40xx</b> supports Tektronix 4010 and others as well as most TEK emulators. <b>vttek</b> supports VT-like tek40xx terminal emulators. The following are present only if selected when gnuplot is built: <b>kc-tek40xx</b> supports MS-DOS Kermit Tek4010 terminal emulators in color; <b>km-tek40xx</b> supports them in monochrome. <b>selanar</b> supports Selanar graphics. <b>bitgraph</b> supports BBN Bitgraph terminals. None have any options. <h2 id="SECTION050160000000000000000">Tek410x</h2>  The <b>tek410x</b> terminal driver supports the 410x and 420x family of Tektronix terminals. It has no options. <h2 id="SECTION050161000000000000000">Texdraw</h2>  The <b>texdraw</b> terminal driver supports the (La)TeX texdraw environment. It is intended for use with the texdraw package, see https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/texdraw/ . <pre>
set terminal texdraw
               {size &lt;XX&gt;{unit},&lt;YY&gt;{unit}}
               {standalone | input}
               {blacktext | colortext | colourtext}
               {linewidth &lt;lw&gt;} {rounded | butt}
               {pointscale &lt;ps&gt;}
               {psarrows | gparrows} {texpoints | gppoints}
               {background &lt;rgbcolor&gt;}</pre>  <p> Note: Graphics are in grayscale only. Text is always black. Boxes and polygons are filled using solid gray levels only. Patterns are not available. </p>
<p> Points, among other things, are drawn using the LaTeX commands <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>Diamond<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>Box<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. These commands no longer belong to the LaTeX2e core; they are included in the latexsym package, which is part of the base distribution and thus part of any LaTeX implementation. Please do not forget to use this package. Other point types use symbols from the amssymb package. For compatibility with plain TeX you need to specify the <b>gppoints</b> option. </p>
<p> <b>standalone</b> produces a LaTeX file with possibly multiple plots, ready to be compiled. The default is <b>input</b> to produce a TeX file which can be included. </p>
<p> <b>blacktext</b> forces all text to be written in black. <b>colortext</b> enables <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>colored<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> text. The default is <b>blacktext</b> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>color<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> means grayscale really. </p>
<p> <b>rounded</b> sets line caps and line joins to be rounded; <b>butt</b> sets butt caps and mitered joins and is the default. </p>
<p> <b>linewidth</b> and <b>pointscale</b> scale the width of lines and the size of point symbols, respectively. <b>pointscale</b>only applies to <b>gppoints</b>. </p>
<p> <b>psarrows</b> draws <b>arrow</b>s using TeXdraw commands which are shorter but do not offer all options. <b>gparrows</b> selects drawing drawing arrows using gnuplot's own routine for full functionality instead. Similarly, <b>texpoints</b>, and <b>gppoints</b> select LaTeX symbols or gnuplot's point drawing routines. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050162000000000000000">Tgif</h2>  Legacy terminal (present only if gnuplot was configured –with-tgif). Tgif is/was an Xlib based interactive 2-D vector graphics drawing tool also capable of importing and marking up bitmap images. <p> The <b>tgif</b> driver supports a choice of font and font size and multiple graphs on the page. The proportions of the axes are not changed. </p>
<p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal tgif {portrait | landscape | default} {&lt;[x,y]&gt;}
                  {monochrome | color}
                  {{linewidth | lw} &lt;LW&gt;}
                  {solid | dashed}
                  {font "&lt;fontname&gt;{,&lt;fontsize&gt;}"}</pre>  <p> where <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>[x,y]<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> specifies the number of graphs in the x and y directions on the page, <b>color</b> enables color, <b>linewidth</b> scales all linewidths by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>LW<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fontname<span class="MATH">&gt;</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is the name of a valid PostScript font, and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fontsize<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> specifies the size of the PostScript font. <b>defaults</b> sets all options to their defaults: <b>portrait</b>, <b>[1,1]</b>, <b>color</b>, <b>linewidth 1.0</b>, <b>dashed</b>, <b><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Helvetica,18<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b>. </p>
<p> The <b>solid</b> option is usually preferred if lines are colored, as they often are in the editor. Hardcopy will be black-and-white, so <b>dashed</b> should be chosen for that. </p>
<p> Multiplot is implemented in two different ways. </p>
<p> The first multiplot implementation is the standard gnuplot multiplot feature: </p>
<pre>
set terminal tgif
set output "file.obj"
set multiplot
set origin x01,y01
set size  xs,ys
plot ...
     ...
set origin x02,y02
plot ...
unset multiplot</pre>  <p> See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_multiplot">set multiplot</a></b> for further information. </p>
<p> The second version is the [x,y] option for the driver itself. The advantage of this implementation is that everything is scaled and placed automatically without the need for setting origins and sizes; the graphs keep their natural x/y proportions of 3/2 (or whatever is fixed by <b>set size</b>). </p>
<p> If both multiplot methods are selected, the standard method is chosen and a warning message is given. </p>
<p> Examples of single plots (or standard multiplot):  </p>
<pre>
set terminal tgif                  # defaults
set terminal tgif "Times-Roman,24"
set terminal tgif landscape
set terminal tgif landscape solid</pre>  <p> Examples using the built-in multiplot mechanism:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal tgif portrait [2,4]  # portrait; 2 plots in the x-
                                  # and 4 in the y-direction
set terminal tgif [1,2]           # portrait; 1 plot in the x-
                                  # and 2 in the y-direction
set terminal tgif landscape [3,3] # landscape; 3 plots in both
                                  # directions</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION050163000000000000000">Tikz</h2>  This driver creates output for use with the TikZ package of graphics macros in TeX. It is currently implemented via an external lua script, and <b>set term tikz</b> is a short form of the command <b>set term lua tikz</b>. See <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#term_lua">term lua</a></b> for more information. Use the command <b>set term tikz help</b> to print terminal options. <h2 id="SECTION050164000000000000000">Tkcanvas</h2>  This terminal driver generates Tk canvas widget commands in one of the following scripting languages: Tcl (default), Perl, Python, Ruby, or REXX. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal tkcanvas {tcl | perl | perltkx | python | ruby | rexx}
                      {standalone | input}
                      {interactive}
                      {rounded | butt}
                      {nobackground | background &lt;rgb color&gt;}
                      {{no}rottext}
                      {size &lt;width&gt;,&lt;height&gt;}
                      {{no}enhanced}
                      {externalimages | pixels}</pre>  <p> Execute the following sequence of Tcl/Tk commands to display the result: </p>

    cmd = TkWait()
    if cmd = 'AWinClose' then leave
    interpret 'call' cmd
end</pre>  <p> The code generated by <b>gnuplot</b> (in the above examples, this code is written to <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>plot.<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ext<span class="MATH">&gt;</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>) contains the following procedures: </p>
<p> gnuplot(canvas)  </p>
<pre>
takes the name of a canvas as its argument.
When called, it clears the canvas, finds the size of the canvas and
draws the plot in it, scaled to fit.</pre>  <p> gnuplot_plotarea()  </p>
<pre>
returns a list containing the borders of the plotting area
(xleft, xright, ytop, ybot) in canvas screen coordinates.    It works only for 2-dimensional plotting (`plot`).</pre>  <p> gnuplot_axisranges()  </p>
<pre>
returns the ranges of the two axes in plot coordinates
(x1min, x1max, y1min, y1max, x2min, x2max, y2min, y2max).
It works only for 2-dimensional plotting (`plot`).</pre>  <p> You can create self-contained, minimal scripts using the <b>standalone</b> option. The default is <b>input</b> which creates scripts which have to be source'd (or loaded or called or whatever the adequate term is for the language selected). </p>
<p> If the <b>interactive</b> option is specified, mouse clicking on a line segment will print the coordinates of its midpoint to stdout. The user can supersede this behavior by supplying a procedure user_gnuplot_coordinates which takes the following arguments:  </p>
<pre>
win id x1s y1s x2s y2s x1e y1e x2e y2e x1m y1m x2m y2m,</pre>  i.e. the name of the canvas and the id of the line segment followed by the coordinates of its start and end point in the two possible axis ranges; the coordinates of the midpoint are only filled for logarithmic axes. <p> By default the canvas is <b>transparent</b>, but an explicit background color can be set with the <b>background</b> option. </p>
<p> <b>rounded</b> sets line caps and line joins to be rounded; <b>butt</b> is the default: butt caps and mitered joins. </p>
<p> Text at arbitrary angles can be activated with the <b>rottext</b> option, which requires Tcl/Tk 8.6 or later. The default is <b>norottext</b>. </p>
<p> The <b>size</b> option tries to optimize the tic and font sizes for the given canvas size. By default an output size of 800 x 600 pixels is assumed. </p>
<p> <b>enhanced</b> selects <b>enhanced text</b> processing (default), but is currently only available for Tcl. </p>
<p> The <b>pixels</b> (default) option selects the failsafe pixel-by-pixel image handler, see also <b><a href="image.html#image_pixels">image pixels</a></b>. The <b>externalimages</b> option saves images as external png images, which are later loaded and scaled by the tkcanvas code. This option is only available for Tcl and display may be slow in some situations since the Tk image handler does not provide arbitrary scaling. Scripts need to source the provided rescale.tcl. </p>
<p> Interactive mode is not yet implemented for Python/Tk and Rexx/Tk. Interactive mode for Ruby/Tk does not yet support user_gnuplot_coordinates. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION050165000000000000000">Tpic</h2>  Note: Legacy terminal (not built by default). The latex, emtex, eepic, and tpic terminals in older versions of gnuplot provided minimal support for graphics styles beyond simple lines and points. They have been directly superseded by the <b>pict2e</b> terminal. For more capable TeX/LaTeX compatible terminal types see <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#cairolatex">cairolatex</a></b>, <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#context">context</a></b>, <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#epslatex">epslatex</a></b>, <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#mp">mp</a></b>, <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#pstricks">pstricks</a></b>, and <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#tikz">tikz</a></b>. <p> The <b>tpic</b> terminal driver supports the LaTeX picture environment with tpic  <span class="MATH">\</span>specials. Options are the point size, line width, and dot-dash interval. </p>
<p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal tpic &lt;pointsize&gt; &lt;linewidth&gt; &lt;interval&gt;</pre>  <p> where <b>pointsize</b> and <b>linewidth</b> are integers in milli-inches and <b>interval</b> is a float in inches. If a non-positive value is specified, the default is chosen: pointsize = 40, linewidth = 6, interval = 0.1. </p>
<p> All drivers for LaTeX offer a special way of controlling text positioning: If any text string begins with '{', you also need to include a '}' at the end of the text, and the whole text will be centered both horizontally and vertically by LaTeX. — If the text string begins with '[', you need to continue it with: a position specification (up to two out of t,b,l,r), ']{', the text itself, and finally, '}'. The text itself may be anything LaTeX can typeset as an LR-box.  <span class="MATH">\</span>rule{}{}'s may help for best positioning. </p>
<p> Examples: About label positioning: Use gnuplot defaults (mostly sensible, but sometimes not really best):  </p>
<pre>
set title '\LaTeX\ -- $ \gamma $'</pre>  Force centering both horizontally and vertically:  <pre>
set label '{\LaTeX\ -- $ \gamma $}' at 0,0</pre>  Specify own positioning (top here):  <pre>
set xlabel '[t]{\LaTeX\ -- $ \gamma $}'</pre>  The other label – account for long ticlabels:  <pre>
set ylabel '[r]{\LaTeX\ -- $ \gamma $\rule{7mm}{0pt}}'</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION050166000000000000000">VWS</h2>  Note: legacy terminal. The <b>VWS</b> terminal driver supports the VAX Windowing System. It has no options. It will sense the display type (monochrome, gray scale, or color.) All line styles are plotted as solid lines. <h2 id="SECTION050167000000000000000">Windows</h2>  The <b>windows</b> terminal is a fast interactive terminal driver that uses the Windows GDI to draw and write text. The cross-platform <b>terminal wxt</b> and <b>terminal qt</b> are also supported on Windows. <p> Syntax:  </p>

This is no longer supported. <b>linewidth</b>, <b>fontscale</b>, <b>pointscale</b> can be used to scale the width of lines, the size of text, or the size of the point symbols. <b>title</b> changes the title of the graph window. <b>size</b> defines the width and height of the window's drawing area in pixels, <b>wsize</b> defines the actual size of the window itself and <b>position</b> defines the origin of the window i.e. the position of the top left corner on the screen (again in pixel). These options override any default settings from the <b>wgnuplot.ini</b> file. </p>
<p> <b>docked</b> embeds the graph window in the wgnuplot text window and the <b>size</b> and <b>position</b> options are ignored. Note that <b>docked</b> is not available for console-mode gnuplot.

By giving the optional argument <b>-persist</b> (same as for gnuplot under x11; former Windows-only options <b>/noend</b> or <b>-noend</b> are still accepted as well), will not close gnuplot. Contrary to gnuplot on other operating systems, gnuplot's interactive command line is accessible after the -persist option. </p>
<p> The plot window remains open when the gnuplot terminal is changed with a <b>set term</b> command. The plot window can be closed with <b>set term windows close</b>. </p>
<p> <b>gnuplot</b> supports different methods to create printed output on Windows, see <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#windows_printing">windows printing</a></b>. The windows terminal supports data exchange with other programs via clipboard and EMF files, see <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#graph-menu">graph-menu</a></b>. You can also use the <b>terminal emf</b> to create EMF files. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION050167100000000000000">Graph-menu</h3>  The <b>gnuplot graph</b> window has the following options on a pop-up menu accessed by pressing the right mouse button(*) or selecting <b>Options</b> from the system menu or the toolbar: <p> <b>Copy to Clipboard</b> copies a bitmap and an enhanced metafile picture. </p>
<p> <b>Save as EMF...</b> allows the user to save the current graph window as enhanced metafile (EMF or EMF+). </p>
<p> <b>Save as Bitmap...</b> allows the user to save a copy of the graph as bitmap file. </p>
<p> <b>Print...</b> prints the graphics windows using a Windows printer driver and allows selection of the printer and scaling of the output. See also <b><a href="complete_list_terminals.html#windows_printing">windows printing</a></b>. </p>
<p> <b>Bring to Top</b> when checked raises the graph window to the top after every plot. </p>
<p> <b>Color</b> when checked enables color output. When unchecked it forces all grayscale output. This is e.g. useful to test appearance of monochrome printouts. </p>
<p> The <b>GDI backend</b> which uses the classic GDI API is deprecated and has been disabled in this version. </p>
<p> <b>GDI+ backend</b> draws to the screen using the GDI+ Windows API. It supports full antialiasing, oversampling, transparency and custom dash patterns. This was the default in versions 5.0 and 5.2. </p>
<p> <b>Direct2D backend</b> uses Direct2D &amp; DirectWrite APIs to draw. It uses graphic card acceleration and is hence typically much faster. Since Direct2D can not create EMF data, saving and copying to clipboard of EMF data fall back to GDI+ while bitmap data is generated by D2d. This is the recommended and default backend since version 5.3. </p>
<p> <b>Oversampling</b> draws diagonal lines at fractional pixel positions to avoid <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>wobbling<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> effects. Vertical or horizontal lines are still snapped to integer pixel positions to avoid blurry lines. </p>
<p> <b>Antialiasing</b> enables smoothing of lines and edges. Note that this slows down drawing. <b>Antialiasing of polygons</b> is enabled by default but might slow down drawing with the GDI+ backend. </p>
<p> <b>Fast rotation</b> switches antialiasing temporarily off while rotating the graph with the mouse. This speeds up drawing considerably at the expense of an additional redraw after releasing the mouse button. </p>
<p> <b>Background...</b> sets the window background color. </p>
<p> <b>Choose Font...</b> selects the font used in the graphics window. </p>
<p> <b>Update wgnuplot.ini</b> saves the current window locations, window sizes, text window font, text window font size, graph window font, graph window font size, background color to the initialization file <b>wgnuplot.ini</b>. </p>

<h2 id="SECTION050168000000000000000">Wxt</h2>  The <b>wxt</b> terminal device generates output in a separate window. The window is created by the wxWidgets library, where the 'wxt' comes from. The actual drawing is done via cairo, a 2D graphics library, and pango, a library for laying out and rendering text. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set term wxt {&lt;n&gt;}
             {size &lt;width&gt;,&lt;height&gt;} {position &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;}

             {{no}raise}
             {{no}ctrl}
             {close}</pre>  <p> Multiple plot windows are supported: <b>set terminal wxt <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> directs the output to plot window number n. </p>
<p> The default window title is based on the window number. This title can also be specified with the keyword <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>title<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> Plot windows remain open even when the <b>gnuplot</b> driver is changed to a different device. A plot window can be closed by pressing the letter 'q' while that window has input focus, by choosing <b>close</b> from a window manager menu, or with <b>set term wxt <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> close</b>. </p>
<p> The size of the plot area is given in pixels, it defaults to 640x384. In addition to that, the actual size of the window also includes the space reserved for the toolbar and the status bar. When you resize a window, the plot is immediately scaled to fit in the new size of the window. Unlike other interactive terminals, the <b>wxt</b> terminal scales the whole plot, including fonts and linewidths, and keeps its global aspect ratio constant, leaving an empty space painted in gray. If you type <b>replot</b>, click the <b>replot</b> icon in the terminal toolbar or type a new <b>plot</b> command, the new plot will completely fit in the window and the font size and the linewidths will be reset to their defaults. </p>
<p> The position option can be used to set the position of the plot window. The position option only applies to the first plot after the <b>set term</b> command. </p>
<p> The active plot window (the one selected by <b>set term wxt <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>) is interactive. Its behaviour is shared with other terminal types. See <b><a href="set_show.html#mouse">mouse</a></b> for details. It also has some extra icons, which are supposed to be self-explanatory. </p>
<p> This terminal supports an enhanced text mode, which allows font and other formatting commands (subscripts, superscripts, etc.) to be embedded in labels and other text strings. The enhanced text mode syntax is shared with other gnuplot terminal types. See <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced">enhanced</a></b> for more details. </p>
<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>font<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is in the format <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>FontFace,FontSize<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, i.e. the face and the size comma-separated in a single string. FontFace is a usual font face name, such as 'Arial'. If you do not provide FontFace, the wxt terminal will use 'Sans'. FontSize is the font size, in points. If you do not provide it, the wxt terminal will use a size of 10 points.  </p>
<pre>
For example :
   set term wxt font "Arial,12"
   set term wxt font "Arial" # to change the font face only
   set term wxt font ",12" # to change the font size only
   set term wxt font "" # to reset the font name and size</pre>  <p> The fonts are retrieved from the usual fonts subsystems. Under Windows, those fonts are to be found and configured in the entry <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Fonts<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> of the control panel. Under UNIX, they are handled by <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>fontconfig<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> Pango, the library used to layout the text, is based on utf-8. Thus, the wxt terminal has to convert from your encoding to utf-8. The default input encoding is based on your 'locale'. If you want to use another encoding, make sure gnuplot knows which one you are using. See <b><a href="set_show.html#encoding">encoding</a></b> for more details. </p>
<p> Pango may give unexpected results with fonts that do not respect the unicode mapping. With the Symbol font, for example, the wxt terminal will use the map provided by http://www.unicode.org/ to translate character codes to unicode. Pango will do its best to find a font containing this character, looking for your Symbol font, or other fonts with a broad unicode coverage, like the DejaVu fonts. Note that <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>the Symbol font<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is to be understood as the Adobe Symbol font, distributed with Acrobat Reader as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>SY______.PFB<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. Alternatively, the OpenSymbol font, distributed with OpenOffice.org as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>opens___.ttf<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, offers the same characters. Microsoft has distributed a Symbol font (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>symbol.ttf<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>), but it has a different character set with several missing or moved mathematic characters. If you experience problems with your default setup (if the demo enhancedtext.dem is not displayed properly for example), you probably have to install one of the Adobe or OpenOffice Symbol fonts, and remove the Microsoft one. Other non-conform fonts, such as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>wingdings<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> have been observed working. </p>
<p> The rendering of the plot can be altered with a dialog available from the toolbar. To obtain the best output possible, the rendering involves three mechanisms : antialiasing, oversampling and hinting. Antialiasing allows to display non-horizontal and non-vertical lines smoother. Oversampling combined with antialiasing provides subpixel accuracy, so that gnuplot can draw a line from non-integer coordinates. This avoids wobbling effects on diagonal lines ('plot x' for example). Hinting avoids the blur on horizontal and vertical lines caused by oversampling. The terminal will snap these lines to integer coordinates so that a one-pixel-wide line will actually be drawn on one and only one pixel. </p>
<p> By default, the window is raised to the top of your desktop when a plot is drawn. This can be controlled with the keyword <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>raise<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. The keyword <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>persist<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> will prevent gnuplot from exiting before you explicitly close all the plot windows. Finally, by default the key <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>space<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> raises the gnuplot console window, and 'q' closes the plot window. The keyword <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>ctrl<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> allows you to replace those bindings by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ctrl<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>+<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>space<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ctrl<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>+'q', respectively. These three keywords (raise, persist and ctrl) can also be set and remembered between sessions through the configuration dialog. </p>

If n is not 0, the terminal number will be appended to the window title (unless a title has been supplied manually) and the icon will be labeled <b>Gnuplot <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. The active window may be distinguished by a change in cursor (from default to crosshair). </p>
<p> The <b>x11</b> terminal can connect to X windows previously created by an outside application via the option <b>window</b> followed by a string containing the X ID for the window in hexadecimal format. Gnuplot uses that external X window as a container since X does not allow for multiple clients selecting the ButtonPress event. In this way, gnuplot's mouse features work within the contained plot window. </p>
<pre>
set term x11 window "220001e"</pre>  <p> The x11 terminal supports enhanced text mode (see <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced">enhanced</a></b>), subject to the available fonts. In order for font size commands embedded in text to have any effect, the default x11 font must be scalable. Thus the first example below will work as expected, but the second will not. </p>
<pre>
set term x11 enhanced font "arial,15" 
set title '{/=20 Big} Medium {/=5 Small}'</pre>  <pre>
set term x11 enhanced font "terminal-14" 
set title '{/=20 Big} Medium {/=5 Small}'</pre>  <p> Plot windows remain open even when the <b>gnuplot</b> driver is changed to a different device. A plot window can be closed by pressing the letter q while that window has input focus, or by choosing <b>close</b> from a window manager menu. All plot windows can be closed by specifying <b>reset</b>, which actually terminates the subprocess which maintains the windows (unless <b>-persist</b> was specified). The <b>close</b> command can be used to close individual plot windows by number. However, after a <b>reset</b>, those plot windows left due to persist cannot be closed with the command <b>close</b>. A <b>close</b> without a number closes the current active plot window. </p>
<p> The gnuplot outboard driver, gnuplot_x11, is searched in a default place chosen when the program is compiled. You can override that by defining the environment variable GNUPLOT_DRIVER_DIR to point to a different location. </p>
<p> Plot windows will automatically be closed at the end of the session unless the <b>-persist</b> option was given. </p>
<p> The options <b>persist</b> and <b>raise</b> are unset by default, which means that the defaults (persist == no and raise == yes) or the command line options -persist / -raise or the Xresources are taken. If [no]persist or [no]raise are specified, they will override command line options and Xresources. Setting one of these options takes place immediately, so the behaviour of an already running driver can be modified. If the window does not get raised, see discussion in <b><a href="raise.html#raise">raise</a></b>. </p>
<p> The option <b>replotonresize</b> (active by default) replots the data when the plot window is resized. Without this option, the even-aspect-ratio scaling may result in the plot filling only part of the window after resizing. With this option, gnuplot does a full replot on each resize event, resulting in better space utilization. This option is generally desirable, unless the potentially CPU-intensive replotting during resizing is a concern. Replots can be manually initiated with hotkey 'e' or the 'replot' command. </p>
<p> The option <b>title <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>title name<span class="MATH">&gt;</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b> will supply the title name of the window for the current plot window or plot window <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> if a number is given. Where (or if) this title is shown depends on your X window manager. </p>
<p> The size option can be used to set the size of the plot window. The size option will only apply to newly created windows. </p>
<p> The position option can be used to set the position of the plot window. The position option will only apply to newly created windows. </p>
<p> The size or aspect ratio of a plot may be changed by resizing the <b>gnuplot</b> window. </p>
<p> Linewidths and pointsizes may be changed from within <b>gnuplot</b> with <b>set linestyle</b>. </p>
<p> For terminal type <b>x11</b>, <b>gnuplot</b> accepts (when initialized) the standard X Toolkit options and resources such as geometry, font, and name from the command line arguments or a configuration file. See the X(1) man page (or its equivalent) for a description of such options. </p>
<p>  A number of other <b>gnuplot</b> options are available for the <b>x11</b> terminal. These may be specified either as command-line options when <b>gnuplot</b> is invoked or as resources in the configuration file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>.Xdefaults<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. They are set upon initialization and cannot be altered during a <b>gnuplot</b> session. (except <b>persist</b> and <b>raise</b>) </p>
<h3 id="SECTION050169100000000000000">X11_fonts</h3>   Upon initial startup, the default font is taken from the X11 resources as set in the system or user .Xdefaults file or on the command line. <p> Example:  </p>

The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>size<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>slant<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>weight<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> specifications are all optional. If you do not specify <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>slant<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> or <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>weight<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> then you will get whatever font variant the font server offers first. You may set a default encoding via the corresponding X11 resource. E.g.  <pre>
gnuplot*encoding: iso8859-15</pre>  The driver also recognizes some common PostScript font names and replaces them with possible X11 or TrueType equivalents. This same sequence is used to process font requests from <b>set label</b>. <p> If your gnuplot was built with configuration option –enable-x11-mbfonts, you can specify multi-byte fonts by using the prefix <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>mbfont:<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> on the font name. An additional font may be given, separated by a semicolon. Since multi-byte font encodings are interpreted according to the locale setting, you must make sure that the environmental variable LC_CTYPE is set to some appropriate locale value such as ja_JP.eucJP, ko_KR.EUC, or zh_CN.EUC. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set term x11 font 'mbfont:kana14;k14'
      # 'kana14' and 'k14' are Japanese X11 font aliases, and ';'
      # is the separator of font names.
set term x11 font 'mbfont:fixed,16,r,medium'
      # &lt;font&gt;,&lt;size&gt;,&lt;slant&gt;,&lt;weight&gt; form is also usable.
set title '(mb strings)' font 'mbfont:*-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*'</pre>  <p> The same syntax applies to the default font in Xresources settings, for example,  </p>
<pre>
gnuplot*font: \
    mbfont:-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0208.1983-0</pre>  <p> If gnuplot is built with –enable-x11-mbfonts, you can use two special PostScript font names 'Ryumin-Light-*' and 'GothicBBB-Medium-*' (standard Japanese PS fonts) without the prefix <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>mbfont:<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>

The number of colors which can be allocated depends on the visual class chosen. On a visual class with a depth <span class="MATH">&gt;</span> 12bit, gnuplot starts with a maximal number of 0x200 colors. On a visual class with a depth <span class="MATH">&gt;</span> 8bit (but <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>= 12 bit) the maximal number of colors is 0x100, on <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>= 8bit displays the maximum number of colors is 240 (16 are left for line colors). </p>
<p> Gnuplot first starts to allocate the maximal number of colors as stated above. If this fails, the number of colors is reduced by the factor 2 until gnuplot gets all colors which are requested. If dividing <b>maxcolors</b> by 2 repeatedly results in a number which is smaller than <b>mincolors</b> <b>gnuplot</b> tries to install a private colormap. In this case the window manager is responsible for swapping colormaps when the pointer is moved in and out the x11 driver's window. </p>
<p> The default for <b>mincolors</b> is maxcolors / (num_colormaps <span class="MATH">&gt;</span> 1 ? 2 : 8), where num_colormaps is the number of colormaps which are currently used by gnuplot (usually 1, if only one x11 window is open). </p>
<p> Some systems support multiple (different) visual classes together on one screen. On these systems it might be necessary to force gnuplot to use a specific visual class, e.g. the default visual might be 8bit PseudoColor but the screen would also support 24bit TrueColor which would be the preferred choice. </p>
<p> The information about an Xserver's capabilities can be obtained with the program <b>xdpyinfo</b>. For the visual names below you can choose one of StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor, DirectColor. If an Xserver supports a requested visual type at different depths, <b>gnuplot</b> chooses the visual class with the highest depth (deepest). If the requested visual class matches the default visual and multiple classes of this type are supported, the default visual is preferred. </p>
<p> Example: on an 8bit PseudoColor visual you can force a private color map by specifying <b>gnuplot*maxcolors: 240</b> and <b>gnuplot*mincolors: 240</b>. </p>
