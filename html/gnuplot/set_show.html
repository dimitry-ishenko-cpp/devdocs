<p> The position of the first end point of the arrow is always specified by <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>from<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>.

<h2 id="SECTION040293000000000000000">Autoscale</h2>   Autoscaling may be set individually on the x, y or z axis or globally on all axes. The default is to autoscale all axes. If you want to autoscale based on a subset of the plots in the figure, you can mark the other ones with the flag <b>noautoscale</b>. See <b><a href="plot.html#datafile">datafile</a></b>. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set autoscale {&lt;axes&gt;{|min|max|fixmin|fixmax|fix} | fix | keepfix}
set autoscale noextend
unset autoscale {&lt;axes&gt;}
show autoscale</pre>  <p> where <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>axes<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is either <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>z</b>, <b>cb</b>, <b>x2</b>, <b>y2</b>, <b>xy</b>, or <b>paxis {n}</b>. A keyword with <b>min</b> or <b>max</b> appended (this cannot be done with <b>xy</b>) tells <b>gnuplot</b> to autoscale just the minimum or maximum of that axis. If no keyword is given, all axes are autoscaled. </p>
<p> When autoscaling, the axis range is automatically computed and the dependent axis (y for a <b>plot</b> and z for <b>splot</b>) is scaled to include the range of the function or data being plotted. </p>
<p> If autoscaling of the dependent axis (y or z) is not set, the current y or z range is used. </p>
<p> Autoscaling the independent variables (x for <b>plot</b> and x,y for <b>splot</b>) is a request to set the domain to match any data file being plotted. If there are no data files, autoscaling an independent variable has no effect. In other words, in the absence of a data file, functions alone do not affect the x range (or the y range if plotting z = f(x,y)). </p>
<p> Please see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xrange">set xrange</a></b> for additional information about ranges. </p>
<p> The behavior of autoscaling remains consistent in parametric mode, (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_parametric">set parametric</a></b>). However, there are more dependent variables and hence more control over x, y, and z axis scales. In parametric mode, the independent or dummy variable is t for <b>plot</b>s and u,v for <b>splot</b>s. <b>autoscale</b> in parametric mode, then, controls all ranges (t, u, v, x, y, and z) and allows x, y, and z to be fully autoscaled. </p>
<p> When tics are displayed on second axes but no plot has been specified for those axes, x2range and y2range are inherited from xrange and yrange. This is done <em>before</em> applying offsets or autoextending the ranges to a whole number of tics, which can cause unexpected results. To prevent this you can explicitly link the secondary axis range to the primary axis range. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_link">set link</a></b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION040293100000000000000">Noextend</h3>     <pre>
set autoscale noextend</pre>  <p> By default autoscaling sets the axis range limits to the nearest tic label position that includes all the plot data. Keywords <b>fixmin</b>, <b>fixmax</b>, <b>fix</b> or <b>noextend</b> tell gnuplot to disable extension of the axis range to the next tic mark position. In this case the axis range limit exactly matches the coordinate of the most extreme data point. <b>set autoscale noextend</b> is a synonym for <b>set autoscale fix</b>. Range extension for a single axis can be disabled by appending the <b>noextend</b> keyword to the corresponding range command, e.g.  </p>
<pre>
set yrange [0:*] noextend</pre>  <p> <b>set autoscale keepfix</b> autoscales all axes while leaving the fix settings unchanged. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION040293200000000000000">Examples</h3> Examples: <p> This sets autoscaling of the y axis (other axes are not affected):  </p>
<pre>
set autoscale y</pre>  <p> This sets autoscaling only for the minimum of the y axis (the maximum of the y axis and the other axes are not affected):  </p>
<pre>
set autoscale ymin</pre>  <p> This disables extension of the x2 axis tics to the next tic mark, thus keeping the exact range as found in the plotted data and functions:  </p>
<pre>
set autoscale x2fixmin
set autoscale x2fixmax</pre>  <p> This sets autoscaling of the x and y axes:  </p>
<pre>
set autoscale xy</pre>  <p> This sets autoscaling of the x, y, z, x2 and y2 axes:  </p>
<pre>
set autoscale</pre>  <p> This disables autoscaling of the x, y, z, x2 and y2 axes:  </p>
<pre>
unset autoscale</pre>  <p> This disables autoscaling of the z axis only:  </p>
<pre>
unset autoscale z</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION040293300000000000000">Polar mode</h3> When in polar mode (<b>set polar</b>), the xrange and the yrange may be left in autoscale mode. If <b>set rrange</b> is used to limit the extent of the polar axis, then xrange and yrange will adjust to match this automatically. However, explicit xrange and yrange commands can later be used to make further adjustments. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_rrange">set rrange</a></b>. <p> See also <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/poldat.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">polar demos. </span></a> </p>

See <b><a href="mouse_input.html#bind">bind</a></b>. <h2 id="SECTION040295000000000000000">Bmargin</h2>  The command <b>set bmargin</b> sets the size of the bottom margin. Please see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_margin">set margin</a></b> for details. <h2 id="SECTION040296000000000000000">Border</h2>   The <b>set border</b> and <b>unset border</b> commands control the display of the graph borders for the <b>plot</b> and <b>splot</b> commands. Note that the borders do not necessarily coincide with the axes; with <b>plot</b> they often do, but with <b>splot</b> they usually do not. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set border {&lt;integer&gt;}

           {polar}
unset border
show border</pre>  <p> With a <b>splot</b> displayed in an arbitrary orientation, like <b>set view 56,103</b>, the four corners of the x-y plane can be referred to as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>front<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>back<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>left<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>right<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. A similar set of four corners exist for the top surface, of course. Thus the border connecting, say, the back and right corners of the x-y plane is the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>bottom right back<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> border, and the border connecting the top and bottom front corners is the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>front vertical<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. (This nomenclature is defined solely to allow the reader to figure out the table that follows.) </p>
<p> The borders are encoded in a 12-bit integer: the four low bits control the border for <b>plot</b> and the sides of the base for <b>splot</b>; the next four bits control the verticals in <b>splot</b>; the four high bits control the edges on top of an <b>splot</b>. The border settings is thus the sum of the appropriate entries from the following table: </p>

<p> In 2D plots the border is normally drawn on top of all plots elements (<b>front</b>). If you want the border to be drawn behind the plot elements, use <b>set border back</b>. </p>
<p> In hidden3d plots the lines making up the border are normally subject to the same hidden3d processing as the plot elements. <b>set border behind</b> will override this default. </p>
<p> Using the optional <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>linestyle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>linetype<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>linewidth<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>linecolor<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>dashtype<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> specifiers, the way the border lines are drawn can be influenced (limited by what the current terminal driver supports). Besides the border itself, this line style is used for the tics, independent of whether they are plotted on the border or on the axes (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xtics">set xtics</a></b>). </p>
<p> For <b>plot</b>, tics may be drawn on edges other than bottom and left by enabling the second axes – see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xtics">set xtics</a></b> for details. </p>
<p> If a <b>splot</b> draws only on the base, as is the case with <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><b>unset surface; set contour base</b><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, then the verticals and the top are not drawn even if they are specified. </p>
<p> The <b>set grid</b> options 'back', 'front' and 'layerdefault' also control the order in which the border lines are drawn with respect to the output of the plotted data. </p>
<p> The <b>polar</b> keyword enables a circular border for polar plots. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> Draw default borders:  </p>
<pre>
set border</pre>  <p> Draw only the left and bottom (<b>plot</b>) or both front and back bottom left (<b>splot</b>) borders:  </p>

<pre>
unset xtics; unset ytics; set x2tics; set y2tics; set border 12</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION040297000000000000000">Boxwidth</h2>  The <b>set boxwidth</b> command is used to set the default width of boxes in the <b>boxes</b>, <b>boxerrorbars</b>, <b>boxplot</b>, <b>candlesticks</b> and <b>histograms</b> styles. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set boxwidth {&lt;width&gt;} {absolute|relative}
show boxwidth</pre>  <p> By default, adjacent boxes are extended in width until they touch each other. A different default width may be specified using the <b>set boxwidth</b> command. <b>Relative</b> widths are interpreted as being a fraction of this default width. </p>
<p> An explicit value for the boxwidth is interpreted as being a number of units along the current x axis (<b>absolute</b>) unless the modifier <b>relative</b> is given. If the x axis is a log-scale (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_log">set log</a></b>) then the value of boxwidth is truly <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>absolute<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> only at x=1; this physical width is maintained everywhere along the axis (i.e. the boxes do not become narrower the value of x increases). If the range spanned by a log scale x axis is far from x=1, some experimentation may be required to find a useful value of boxwidth. </p>
<p> The default is superseded by explicit width information taken from an extra data column in styles <b>boxes</b> or <b>boxerrorbars</b>. In a four-column data set, the fourth column will be interpreted as the box width unless the width is set to -2.0, in which case the width will be calculated automatically. See <b><a href="boxes.html#style_boxes">style boxes</a></b> and <b><a href="boxerrorbars.html#style_boxerrorbars">style boxerrorbars</a></b> for more details. </p>
<p> To set the box width to automatic use the command  </p>
<pre>
set boxwidth</pre>  <p> or, for four-column data,  </p>
<pre>
set boxwidth -2</pre>  <p> The same effect can be achieved with the <b>using</b> keyword in <b>plot</b>:  </p>
<pre>
plot 'file' using 1:2:3:4:(-2)</pre>  <p> To set the box width to half of the automatic size use  </p>
<pre>
set boxwidth 0.5 relative</pre>  <p> To set the box width to an absolute value of 2 use  </p>
<pre>
set boxwidth 2 absolute</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION040298000000000000000">Boxdepth</h2>  The <b>set boxdepth</b> command affects only 3D plots created by <b>splot with boxes</b>. It sets the extent of each box along the y axis, i.e. its thickness. <h2 id="SECTION040299000000000000000">Color</h2> Gnuplot supports two alternative sets of linetypes. The default set uses a different color for each linetype, although it also allows you to draw dotted or dashed lines in that color. The alternative monochrome set uses only dot/dash pattern or linewidth to distinguish linetypes. The <b>set color</b> command selects the color linetypes. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_monochrome">set monochrome</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#set_linetype">set linetype</a></b>, and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_colorsequence">set colorsequence</a></b>. <h2 id="SECTION0402910000000000000000">Colorsequence</h2>  Syntax:  <pre>
set colorsequence {default|classic|podo}</pre>  <p> <b>set colorsequence default</b> selects a terminal-independent repeating sequence of eight colors. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_linetype">set linetype</a></b>, <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles.html#colors">colors</a></b>. </p>
<p> <b>set colorsequence classic</b> lets each separate terminal type provide its own sequence of line colors. The number provided varies from 4 to more than 100, but most start with red/green/blue/magenta/cyan/yellow. This was the default behaviour prior to version 5. </p>
<p> <b>set colorsequence podo</b> selects eight colors drawn from a set recommended by Wong (2011) [Nature Methods 8:441] as being easily distinguished by color-blind viewers with either protanopia or deuteranopia. </p>
<p> In each case you can further customize the length of the sequence and the colors used. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_linetype">set linetype</a></b>, <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles.html#colors">colors</a></b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402911000000000000000">Clabel</h2>  This command is deprecated.

unset clip radial</pre>  <p> Data points whose center lies inside the plot boundaries are normally drawn even if the finite size of the point symbol causes it to extend past a boundary line. <b>set clip points</b> causes such points to be clipped (i.e. not drawn) even though the point center is inside the boundaries of a 2D plot. Data points whose center lies outside the plot boundaries are never drawn. </p>
<p> <b>unset clip</b> causes a line segment in a plot not to be drawn if either end of that segment lies outside the plot boundaries (i.e. xrange and yrange). </p>
<p> <b>set clip one</b> causes <b>gnuplot</b> to draw the in-range portion of line segments with one endpoint in range and one endpoint out of range. <b>set clip two</b> causes <b>gnuplot</b> to draw the in-range portion of line segments with both endpoints out of range. Line segments that lie entirely outside the plot boundaries are never drawn. </p>

set contrlabel onecolor</pre>  <p> <b>set cntrlabel</b> controls the labeling of contours, either in the key (default) or on the plot itself in the case of <b>splot ... with labels</b>. In the latter case labels are placed along each contour line according to the <b>pointinterval</b> or <b>pointnumber</b> property of the label descriptor.

However if <b>set samples</b> or <b>set isosamples</b> is large then many contour lines may be created, each with a single label. <p> A contour label is placed in the plot key for each linetype used. By default each contour level is given its own linetype, so a separate label appears for each. The command <b>set cntrlabel onecolor</b> causes all contours to be drawn using the same linetype, so only one label appears in the plot key. This command replaces an older command <b>unset clabel</b>. </p>

show contour</pre>  <p> This command has two functions. First, it sets the values of z for which contours are to be determined. The number of contour levels <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> should be an integral constant expression. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>z1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>z2<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> ... are real-valued expressions. Second, it controls the appearance of the individual contour lines. </p>
<p> Keywords controlling the smoothness of contour lines: </p>
<p> <b>linear</b>, <b>cubicspline</b>, <b>bspline</b> — Controls type of approximation or interpolation. If <b>linear</b>, then straight line segments connect points of equal z magnitude. If <b>cubicspline</b>, then piecewise-linear contours are interpolated between the same equal z points to form somewhat smoother contours, but which may undulate. If <b>bspline</b>, a guaranteed-smoother curve is drawn, which only approximates the position of the points of equal-z. </p>
<p> <b>points</b> — Eventually all drawings are done with piecewise-linear strokes. This number controls the number of line segments used to approximate the <b>bspline</b> or <b>cubicspline</b> curve. Number of cubicspline or bspline segments (strokes) = <b>points</b> * number of linear segments. </p>
<p> <b>order</b> — Order of the bspline approximation to be used. The bigger this order is, the smoother the resulting contour. (Of course, higher order bspline curves will move further away from the original piecewise linear data.) This option is relevant for <b>bspline</b> mode only. Allowed values are integers in the range from 2 (linear) to 10. </p>
<p> Keywords controlling the selection of contour levels: </p>
<p> <b>levels auto</b> — This is the default. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> specifies a nominal number of levels; the actual number will be adjusted to give simple labels. If the surface is bounded by zmin and zmax, contours will be generated at integer multiples of dz between zmin and zmax, where dz is 1, 2, or 5 times some power of ten (like the step between two tic marks). </p>
<p> <b>levels discrete</b> — Contours will be generated at z = <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>z1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>z2<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> ... as specified; the number of discrete levels sets the number of contour levels. In <b>discrete</b> mode, any <b>set cntrparam levels <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> are ignored. </p>
<p> <b>levels incremental</b> — Contours are generated at values of z beginning at <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>start<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and increasing by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>increment<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, until the number of contours is reached. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>end<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is used to determine the number of contour levels, which will be changed by any subsequent <b>set cntrparam levels <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. If the z axis is logarithmic, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>increment<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> will be interpreted as a multiplicative factor, as it is for <b>set ztics</b>, and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>end<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> should not be used. </p>
<p> Keywords controlling the assignment of linetype to contours: </p>
<p> By default the contours are generated in the reverse order specified (<b>unsorted</b>). Thus <b>set cntrparam levels increment 0, 10, 100</b> will create 11 contours levels starting with 100 and ending with 0. Adding the keyword <b>sorted</b> re-orders the contours by increasing numerical value, which in this case would mean the first contour is drawn at 0. </p>
<p> By default contours are drawn using successive linetypes starting with the next linetype after that used for the corresponding surface. Thus <b>splot x*y lt 5</b> would use lt 6 for the first contour generated. If <b>hidden3d</b> mode is active then each surface uses two linetypes. In this case using default settings would cause the first contour to use the same linetype as the hidden surface, which is undesirable. This can be avoided in either of two ways. (1) Use <b>set hidden3d offset N</b> to change the linetype used for the hidden surface. A good choice would be <b>offset -1</b> since that will avoid all the contour linetypes. (2) Use the <b>set cntrparam firstlinetype N</b> option to specify a block of linetypes used for contour lines independent of whatever was used for the surface. This is particularly useful if you want to customize the set of contour linetypes. N <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>= 0 restores the default. </p>
<p> If the command <b>set cntrparam</b> is given without any arguments specified all options are reset to the default:  </p>

<p> The orientation of the color gradient can be switched by options <b>vertical</b> and <b>horizontal</b>. </p>
<p> <b>origin x, y</b> and <b>size x, y</b> are used only in combination with the <b>user</b> option. The x and y values are interpreted as screen coordinates by default, and this is the only legal option for 3D plots. 2D plots, including splot with <b>set view map</b>, allow any coordinate system to be specified. Try for example:  </p>
<pre>
set colorbox horiz user origin .1,.02 size .8,.04</pre>  which will draw a horizontal gradient somewhere at the bottom of the graph. <p> <b>border</b> turns the border on (this is the default). <b>noborder</b> turns the border off. If an positive integer argument is given after <b>border</b>, it is used as a line style tag which is used for drawing the border, e.g.:  </p>
<pre>
set style line 2604 linetype -1 linewidth .4
set colorbox border 2604</pre>  will use line style <b>2604</b>, a thin line with the default border color (-1) for drawing the border. <b>bdefault</b> (which is the default) will use the default border line style for drawing the border of the color box. <p> The axis of the color box is called <b>cb</b> and it is controlled by means of the usual axes commands, i.e. <b>set/unset/show</b> with <b>cbrange</b>, <b>[m]cbtics</b>, <b>format cb</b>, <b>grid [m]cb</b>, <b>cblabel</b>, and perhaps even <b>cbdata</b>, <b>[no]cbdtics</b>, <b>[no]cbmtics</b>. </p>

You can use these to define the color range spanned by a pm3d palette, or to assign a terminal-independent color to a particular linetype or linestyle. To see the list of known color names, use the command <b><a href="set_show.html#show_colornames">show colornames</a></b>. Example: <pre>

This option is available for <b>splot</b> only. It requires grid data, see <b><a href="splot.html#grid_data">grid_data</a></b> for more details. If contours are desired from non-grid data, <b>set dgrid3d</b> can be used to create an appropriate grid. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set contour {base | surface | both}
unset contour
show contour</pre>  <p> The three options specify where to draw the contours: <b>base</b> draws the contours on the grid base where the x/ytics are placed, <b>surface</b> draws the contours on the surfaces themselves, and <b>both</b> draws the contours on both the base and the surface. If no option is provided, the default is <b>base</b>. </p>
<p> See also <b><a href="set_show.html#set_cntrparam">set cntrparam</a></b> for the parameters that affect the drawing of contours, and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_cntrlabel">set cntrlabel</a></b> for control of labeling of the contours. </p>
<p> The surface can be switched off (see <b><a href="set_show.html#unset_surface">unset surface</a></b>), giving a contour-only graph. Though it is possible to use <b>set size</b> to enlarge the plot to fill the screen, more control over the output format can be obtained by writing the contour information to a datablock, and rereading it as a 2D datafile plot: </p>
<pre>
unset surface
set contour
set cntrparam ...
set table $datablock
splot ...
unset table
# contour info now in $datablock
set term &lt;whatever&gt;
plot $datablock</pre>  <p> In order to draw contours, the data should be organized as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>grid data<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. In such a file all the points for a single y-isoline are listed, then all the points for the next y-isoline, and so on. A single blank line (a line containing no characters other than blank spaces and a carriage return and/or a line feed) separates one y-isoline from the next. </p>
<p> While <b>set contour</b> is in effect, <b>splot with <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>style<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> will place the style elements (points, lines, impulses, labels, etc) along the contour lines. <b>with pm3d</b> will produce a pm3d surface and also contour lines. If you want to mix other plot elements, say labels read from a file, with the contours generated while <b>set contour</b> is active you must append the keyword <b>nocontours</b> after that clause in the splot command. </p>

<h2 id="SECTION0402918000000000000000">Dashtype</h2> The <b>set dashtype</b> command allows you to define a dash pattern that can then be referred to by its index. This is purely a convenience, as anywhere that would accept the dashtype by its numerical index would also accept an explicit dash pattern. Example:  <pre>

Please see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_style_data">set style data</a></b>. <h2 id="SECTION0402920000000000000000">Datafile</h2> The <b>set datafile</b> command options control interpretation of fields read from input data files by the <b>plot</b>, <b>splot</b>, and <b>fit</b> commands. Several options are currently implemented. <h3 id="SECTION0402920100000000000000">Set datafile columnheaders</h3>  The <b>set datafile columnheaders</b> command guarantees that the first row of input will be interpreted as column headers rather than as data values. It affects all input data sources to plot, splot, fit, and stats commands. If this setting is disabled by <b>unset datafile columnheaders</b>, the same effect is triggered on a per-file basis if there is an explicit columnheader() function in a using specifier or plot title associated with that file. See also <b><a href="set_show.html#set_key_autotitle">set key autotitle</a></b> and <b><a href="plot.html#columnheader">columnheader</a></b>. <h3 id="SECTION0402920200000000000000">Set datafile fortran</h3>  The <b>set datafile fortran</b> command enables a special check for values in the input file expressed as Fortran D or Q constants. This extra check slows down the input process, and should only be selected if you do in fact have datafiles containing Fortran D or Q constants. The option can be disabled again using <b>unset datafile fortran</b>. <h3 id="SECTION0402920300000000000000">Set datafile nofpe_trap</h3>    The <b>set datafile nofpe_trap</b> command tells gnuplot not to re-initialize a floating point exception handler before every expression evaluation used while reading data from an input file. This can significantly speed data input from very large files at the risk of program termination if a floating-point exception is generated. <h3 id="SECTION0402920400000000000000">Set datafile missing</h3>  Syntax:  <pre>
set datafile missing "&lt;string&gt;"
set datafile missing NaN
show datafile missing
unset datafile</pre>  <p> The <b>set datafile missing</b> command tells <b>gnuplot</b> there is a special string used in input data files to denote a missing data entry. There is no default character for <b>missing</b>. Gnuplot makes a distinction between missing data and invalid data (e.g. <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>NaN<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, 1/0.). For example invalid data causes a gap in a line drawn through sequential data points; missing data does not. </p>
<p> Non-numeric characters found in a numeric field will usually be interpreted as invalid rather than as a missing data point unless they happen to match the <b>missing</b> string. </p>
<p> Conversely <b>set datafile missing NaN</b> causes all data or expressions evaluating to not-a-number (NaN) to be treated as missing data. </p>
<p> The example below shows differences between gnuplot version 4 and version 5. Example:  </p>
<pre>
set style data linespoints

   1 10
   2 20
   3 NaN
   4 40
   5 50
   e</pre>  <p> Plot (a) differs in gnuplot 4 and gnuplot 5 because the third line contains only one valid number. Version 4 switched to a single-datum-on-a-line convention that the line number is <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>x<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and the datum is <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>y<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, erroneously placing the point at(2,3). </p>
<p> Both the old and new gnuplot versions handle the same data correctly if the '?' character is designated as a marker for missing data (b). </p>
<p> Old gnuplot versions handled NaN differently depending of the form of the <b>using</b> clause, as shown in plots (c) and (d). Gnuplot now handles NaN the same whether the input column was specified as N or ($N). See also the <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/mgr.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">imageNaN demo. </span></a> </p>
<p> Similarly gnuplot 5.4 will notice the missing value flag in column N whether the plot command specifies <b>using N</b> or <b>using ($N)</b> or <b>using (func($N))</b>. However if the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>missing<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> value is encountered during evaluation of some more complicated expression, e.g. <b>using (column(strcol(1))</b>, it may evaluate to NaN and be treated as invalid data rather than as a missing data point. If you nevertheless want to treat this as missing data, use the command <b>set datafile missing NaN</b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402920500000000000000">Set datafile separator</h3>  The command <b>set datafile separator</b> tells <b>gnuplot</b> that data fields in subsequent input files are separated by a specific character rather than by whitespace. The most common use is to read in csv (comma-separated value) files written by spreadsheet or database programs. By default data fields are separated by whitespace. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set datafile separator {whitespace | tab | comma | "&lt;chars&gt;"}</pre>  <p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
# Input file contains tab-separated fields
set datafile separator "\t"</pre>  <pre>
# Input file contains comma-separated values fields

# Input file contains fields separated by either * or |
set datafile separator "*|"</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION0402920600000000000000">Set datafile commentschars</h3>  The command <b>set datafile commentschars</b> specifies what characters can be used in a data file to begin comment lines. If the first non-blank character on a line is one of these characters then the rest of the data line is ignored. Default value of the string is <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>#!<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> on VMS and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>#<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> otherwise. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set datafile commentschars {"&lt;string&gt;"}
show datafile commentschars

<pre>
# 1 2 3 4</pre>  but the following  <pre>

<pre>
set datafile commentschars "#!%"</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION0402920700000000000000">Set datafile binary</h3> The <b>set datafile binary</b> command is used to set the defaults when reading binary data files.

<pre>
set decimalsign {&lt;value&gt; | locale {"&lt;locale&gt;"}}
unset decimalsign
show decimalsign</pre>  <p> The argument <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>value<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is a string to be used in place of the usual decimal point. Typical choices include the period, '.', and the comma, ',', but others may be useful, too. If you omit the <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>value<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> argument, the decimal separator is not modified from the usual default, which is a period. Unsetting decimalsign has the same effect as omitting <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>value<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. </p>
<p> Example: </p>
<p> Correct typesetting in most European countries requires:  </p>
<pre>

If locale <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>foo<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is not found then an error message is printed and the decimal sign setting is unchanged. On linux systems you can get a list of the locales installed on your machine by typing <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>locale -a<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. A typical linux locale string is of the form <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>sl_SI.UTF-8<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>.

<h2 id="SECTION0402922000000000000000">Dgrid3d</h2>    The <b>set dgrid3d</b> command enables, and can set parameters for, non-grid to grid data mapping. See <b><a href="splot.html#splot_grid_data">splot grid_data</a></b> for more details about the grid data structure. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set dgrid3d {&lt;rows&gt;} {,{&lt;cols&gt;}}
            { splines |
              qnorm {&lt;norm&gt;} |

                {kdensity} {&lt;dx&gt;} {,&lt;dy&gt;} }
unset dgrid3d
show dgrid3d</pre>  <p> By default <b>dgrid3d</b> is disabled. When enabled, 3D data read from a file are always treated as a scattered data set. A grid with dimensions derived from a bounding box of the scattered data and size as specified by the row/col_size parameters is created for plotting and contouring. The grid is equally spaced in x (rows) and in y (columns); the z values are computed as weighted averages or spline interpolations of the scattered points' z values. In other words, a regularly spaced grid is created and the a smooth approximation to the raw data is evaluated for all grid points. This approximation is plotted in place of the raw data. </p>
<p> The number of columns defaults to the number of rows, which defaults to 10. </p>
<p> Several algorithms are available to calculate the approximation from the raw data. Some of these algorithms can take additional parameters. These interpolations are such the closer the data point is to a grid point, the more effect it has on that grid point. </p>
<p> The <b>splines</b> algorithm calculates an interpolation based on <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>thin plate splines<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. It does not take additional parameters. </p>
<p> The <b>qnorm</b> algorithm calculates a weighted average of the input data at each grid point. Each data point is weighted by the inverse of its distance from the grid point raised to some power. The power is specified as an optional integer parameter that defaults to 1. This algorithm is the default. </p>
<p> Finally, several smoothing kernels are available to calculate weighted averages: z = Sum_i w(d_i) * z_i / Sum_i w(d_i), where z_i is the value of the i-th data point and d_i is the distance between the current grid point and the location of the i-th data point. All kernels assign higher weights to data points that are close to the current grid point and lower weights to data points further away. </p>
<p> The following kernels are available:  </p>
<pre>
gauss :     w(d) = exp(-d*d)
cauchy :    w(d) = 1/(1 + d*d)
exp :       w(d) = exp(-d)
box :       w(d) = 1                     if d&lt;1
                 = 0                     otherwise
hann :      w(d) = 0.5*(1+cos(pi*d))     if d&lt;1
            w(d) = 0                     otherwise</pre>  <p> When using one of these five smoothing kernels, up to two additional numerical parameters can be specified: dx and dy. These are used to rescale the coordinate differences when calculating the distance: d_i = sqrt( ((x-x_i)/dx)**2 + ((y-y_i)/dy)**2 ), where x,y are the coordinates of the current grid point and x_i,y_i are the coordinates of the i-th data point. The value of dy defaults to the value of dx, which defaults to 1. The parameters dx and dy make it possible to control the radius over which data points contribute to a grid point IN THE UNITS OF THE DATA ITSELF. </p>
<p> The optional keyword <b>kdensity</b>, which must come after the name of the kernel, but before the (optional) scale parameters, modifies the algorithm so that the values calculated for the grid points are not divided by the sum of the weights ( z = Sum_i w(d_i) * z_i ). If all z_i are constant, this effectively plots a bivariate kernel density estimate: a kernel function (one of the five defined above) is placed at each data point, the sum of these kernels is evaluated at every grid point, and this smooth surface is plotted instead of the original data. This is similar in principle to + what the <b>smooth kdensity</b> option does to 1D datasets. (See kdensity2d.dem for usage demo) </p>
<p> A slightly different syntax is also supported for reasons of backwards compatibility. If no interpolation algorithm has been explicitly selected, the <b>qnorm</b> algorithm is assumed. Up to three comma-separated, optional parameters can be specified, which are interpreted as the the number of rows, the number of columns, and the norm value, respectively. </p>
<p> The <b>dgrid3d</b> option is a simple scheme which replaces scattered data with weighted averages on a regular grid. More sophisticated approaches to this problem exist and should be used to preprocess the data outside <b>gnuplot</b> if this simple solution is found inadequate. </p>

It attempts to determine the current locale from the runtime environment. On most systems this is controlled by the environmental variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG. This mechanism is necessary, for example, to pass multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8 or EUC_JP to the wxt and pdf terminals.

        {v4 | v5}
unset fit
show fit</pre>  <p> The <b>logfile</b> option defines where the <b>fit</b> command writes its output. The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>filename<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> argument must be enclosed in single or double quotes. If no filename is given or <b>unset fit</b> is used the log file is reset to its default value <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>fit.log<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> or the value of the environmental variable <b>FIT_LOG</b>. If the given logfile name ends with a / or  <span class="MATH">\</span>, it is interpreted to be a directory name, and the actual filename will be <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>fit.log<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> in that directory. </p>
<p> By default the information written to the log file is also echoed to the terminal session. <b>set fit quiet</b> turns off the echo, whereas <b>results</b> prints only final results. <b>brief</b> gives one line summaries for every iteration of the fit in addition. <b>verbose</b> yields detailed iteration reports as in version 4. </p>
<p> If the <b>errorvariables</b> option is turned on, the error of each fitted parameter computed by <b>fit</b> will be copied to a user-defined variable whose name is formed by appending <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>_err<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> to the name of the parameter itself. This is useful mainly to put the parameter and its error onto a plot of the data and the fitted function, for reference, as in: </p>
<pre>
set fit errorvariables
fit f(x) 'datafile' using 1:2 via a, b
print "error of a is:", a_err
set label 1 sprintf("a=%6.2f +/- %6.2f", a, a_err)
plot 'datafile' using 1:2, f(x)</pre>  <p> If the <b>errorscaling</b> option is specified, which is the default, the calculated parameter errors are scaled with the reduced chi square. This is equivalent to providing data errors equal to the calculated standard deviation of the fit (FIT_STDFIT) resulting in a reduced chi square of one. With the <b>noerrorscaling</b> option the estimated errors are the unscaled standard deviations of the fit parameters. If no weights are specified for the data, parameter errors are always scaled. </p>
<p> If the <b>prescale</b> option is turned on, parameters are prescaled by their initial values before being passed to the Marquardt-Levenberg routine. This helps tremendously if there are parameters that differ in size by many orders of magnitude. Fit parameters with an initial value of exactly zero are never prescaled. </p>
<p> The maximum number of iterations may be limited with the <b>maxiter</b> option. A value of 0 or <b>default</b> means that there is no limit. </p>
<p> The <b>limit</b> option can be used to change the default epsilon limit (1e-5) to detect convergence. When the sum of squared residuals changes by a factor less than this number (epsilon), the fit is considered to have 'converged'. The <b>limit_abs</b> option imposes an additional absolute limit in the change of the sum of squared residuals and defaults to zero. </p>
<p> If you need even more control about the algorithm, and know the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm well, the following options can be used to influence it. The startup value of <b>lambda</b> is normally calculated automatically from the ML-matrix, but if you want to, you may provide your own using the <b>start_lambda</b> option. Setting it to <b>default</b> will re-enable the automatic selection. The option <b>lambda_factor</b> sets the factor by which <b>lambda</b> is increased or decreased whenever the chi-squared target function increased or decreased significantly. Setting it to <b>default</b> re-enables the default factor of 10.0. </p>
<p> The <b>script</b> option may be used to specify a <b>gnuplot</b> command to be executed when a fit is interrupted — see <b><a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a></b>. This setting takes precedence over the default of <b>replot</b> and the environment variable <b>FIT_SCRIPT</b>. </p>
<p> If the <b>covariancevariables</b> option is turned on, the covariances between final parameters will be saved to user-defined variables. The variable name for a certain parameter combination is formed by prepending <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>FIT_COV_<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> to the name of the first parameter and combining the two parameter names by <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>_<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. For example given the parameters <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>a<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>b<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> the covariance variable is named <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>FIT_COV_a_b<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> In version 5 the syntax of the fit command changed and it now defaults to unitweights if no 'error' keyword is given. The <b>v4</b> option restores the default behavior of gnuplot version 4, see also <b><a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a></b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402927000000000000000">Fontpath</h2>  Syntax:  <pre>
set fontpath "/directory/where/my/fonts/live"

<p> The <b>fontpath</b> directory is relevant only for embedding fonts in postscript output produced by the postscript terminal. It has no effect on other gnuplot terminals. If you are not embedding fonts you do not need this command, and even if you are embedding fonts you only need it for fonts that cannot be found via the other paths below. </p>
<p> Earlier versions of gnuplot tried to emulate a font manager by tracking multiple directory trees containing fonts. This is now replaced by a search in the following places: (1) an absolute path given in the <b>set term postscript fontfile</b> command (2) the current directory (3) any of the directories specified by <b>set loadpath</b> (4) the directory specified by <b>set fontpath</b> (5) the directory provided in environmental variable GNUPLOT_FONTPATH </p>

<p> If the empty string <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is given, tics will have no labels, although the tic mark will still be plotted. To eliminate the tic marks, use <b>unset xtics</b> or <b>set tics scale 0</b>. </p>
<p> Newline ( <span class="MATH">\</span>n) and enhanced text markup is accepted in the format string. Use double-quotes rather than single-quotes in this case.

<p> In brief, ISO Week 1 of year YYYY begins on the Monday closest to 1 Jan YYYY. This may place it in the previous calendar year. For example Tue 30 Dec 2008 has ISO week date 2009-W01-2 (2nd day of week 1 of 2009). Up to three days at the start of January may come before the Monday of ISO week 1; these days are assigned to the final week of the previous calendar year. E.g. Fri 1 Jan 2021 has ISO week date 2020-W53-05. </p>
<p> The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) epidemiological week is a similar week date convention that differs from the ISO standard by defining a week as starting on Sunday, rather than on Monday. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402928500000000000000">Weekdate_iso</h3>  Syntax:  <pre>
time = weekdate_iso( year, week [, day] )</pre>  <p> This function converts from the year, week, day components of a date in ISO 8601 <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>week date<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> format to the calendar date as a time in seconds since the epoch date 1 Jan 1970. Note that the nominal year in the week date system is not necessarily the same as the calendar year. The week is an integer from 1 to 53. The day parameter is optional. If it is omitted or equal to 0 the time returned is the start of the week. Otherwise day is an integer from 1 (Monday) to 2 (Sunday).

<h2 id="SECTION0402931000000000000000">Grid</h2>   The <b>set grid</b> command allows grid lines to be drawn on the plot. <p> Syntax:  </p>

set grid {{no}{m}xtics} {{no}{m}ytics} {{no}{m}ztics}
         {{no}{m}x2tics} {{no}{m}y2tics} {{no}{m}rtics}

         {layerdefault | front | back}
         {{no}vertical}
         {&lt;line-properties-major&gt; {, &lt;line-properties-minor&gt;}}
unset grid
show grid</pre>  <p> The grid can be enabled and disabled for the major and/or minor tic marks on any axis, and the linetype and linewidth can be specified for major and minor grid lines, also via a predefined linestyle, as far as the active terminal driver supports this (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_style_line">set style line</a></b>). </p>
<p> A polar grid can be drawn for 2D plots. This is the default action of <b>set grid</b> if the program is already in polar mode, but can be enabled explicitly by <b>set grid polar <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>angle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> rtics</b> whether or not the program is in polar mode. Circles are drawn to intersect major and/or minor tics along the r axis, and radial lines are drawn with a spacing of <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>angle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. Tic marks around the perimeter are controlled by <b>set ttics</b>, but these do not produce radial grid lines. </p>
<p> The pertinent tics must be enabled before <b>set grid</b> can draw them; <b>gnuplot</b> will quietly ignore instructions to draw grid lines at non-existent tics, but they will appear if the tics are subsequently enabled. </p>
<p> If no linetype is specified for the minor gridlines, the same linetype as the major gridlines is used. The default polar angle is 30 degrees. </p>
<p> If <b>front</b> is given, the grid is drawn on top of the graphed data. If <b>back</b> is given, the grid is drawn underneath the graphed data. Using <b>front</b> will prevent the grid from being obscured by dense data. The default setup, <b>layerdefault</b>, is equivalent to <b>back</b> for 2D plots. In 3D plots the default is to split up the grid and the graph box into two layers: one behind, the other in front of the plotted data and functions. Since <b>hidden3d</b> mode does its own sorting, it ignores all grid drawing order options and passes the grid lines through the hidden line removal machinery instead. These options actually affect not only the grid, but also the lines output by <b>set border</b> and the various ticmarks (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xtics">set xtics</a></b>). </p>
<p> In 3D plots grid lines at x- and y- axis tic positions are by default drawn only on the base plane parallel to z=0. The <b>vertical</b> keyword activates drawing grid lines in the xz and yz planes also, running from zmin to zmax. </p>
<p> Z grid lines are drawn on the bottom of the plot. This looks better if a partial box is drawn around the plot — see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_border">set border</a></b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402932000000000000000">Hidden3d</h2>   The <b>set hidden3d</b> command enables hidden line removal for surface plotting (see <b><a href="splot.html#splot">splot</a></b>). Some optional features of the underlying algorithm can also be controlled using this command. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set hidden3d {defaults} |
             { {front|back}
               {{offset &lt;offset&gt;} | {nooffset}}
               {trianglepattern &lt;bitpattern&gt;}
               {{undefined &lt;level&gt;} | {noundefined}}
               {{no}altdiagonal}
               {{no}bentover} }
unset hidden3d
show hidden3d</pre>  <p> In contrast to the usual display in gnuplot, hidden line removal actually treats the given function or data grids as real surfaces that can't be seen through, so plot elements behind the surface will be hidden by it. For this to work, the surface needs to have 'grid structure' (see <b><a href="splot.html#splot_datafile">splot datafile</a></b> about this), and it has to be drawn <b>with lines</b> or <b>with linespoints</b>. </p>
<p> When <b>hidden3d</b> is set, both the hidden portion of the surface and possibly its contours drawn on the base (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_contour">set contour</a></b>) as well as the grid will be hidden. Each surface has its hidden parts removed with respect to itself and to other surfaces, if more than one surface is plotted. Contours drawn on the surface (<b>set contour surface</b>) don't work. </p>
<p> <b>hidden3d</b> also affects 3D plotting styles <b>points</b>, <b>labels</b>, <b>vectors</b>, and <b>impulses</b> even if no surface is present in the graph. Unobscured portions of each vector are drawn as line segments (no arrowheads). Individual plots within the graph may be explicitly excluded from this processing by appending the extra option <b>nohidden3d</b> to the <b>with</b> specifier. </p>
<p> Hidden3d does not affect solid surfaces drawn using the pm3d mode. To achieve a similar effect purely for pm3d surfaces, use instead <b>set pm3d depthorder</b>. To mix pm3d surfaces with normal <b>hidden3d</b> processing, use the option <b>set hidden3d front</b> to force all elements included in hidden3d processing to be drawn after any remaining plot elements, including the pm3d surface. </p>
<p> Functions are evaluated at isoline intersections. The algorithm interpolates linearly between function points or data points when determining the visible line segments. This means that the appearance of a function may be different when plotted with <b>hidden3d</b> than when plotted with <b>nohidden3d</b> because in the latter case functions are evaluated at each sample. Please see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_samples">set samples</a></b> and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_isosamples">set isosamples</a></b> for discussion of the difference. </p>
<p> The algorithm used to remove the hidden parts of the surfaces has some additional features controllable by this command. Specifying <b>defaults</b> will set them all to their default settings, as detailed below. If <b>defaults</b> is not given, only explicitly specified options will be influenced: all others will keep their previous values, so you can turn on/off hidden line removal via <b>set {no}hidden3d</b>, without modifying the set of options you chose. </p>
<p> The first option, <b>offset</b>, influences the linetype used for lines on the 'back' side. Normally, they are drawn in a linetype one index number higher than the one used for the front, to make the two sides of the surface distinguishable. You can specify a different linetype offset to add instead of the default 1, by <b>offset <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>offset<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. Option <b>nooffset</b> stands for <b>offset 0</b>, making the two sides of the surface use the same linetype. </p>
<p> Next comes the option <b>trianglepattern <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>bitpattern<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>bitpattern<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> must be a number between 0 and 7, interpreted as a bit pattern. Each bit determines the visibility of one edge of the triangles each surface is split up into. Bit 0 is for the 'horizontal' edges of the grid, Bit 1 for the 'vertical' ones, and Bit 2 for the diagonals that split each cell of the original grid into two triangles. The default pattern is 3, making all horizontal and vertical lines visible, but not the diagonals. You may want to choose 7 to see those diagonals as well. </p>
<p> The <b>undefined <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>level<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> option lets you decide what the algorithm is to do with data points that are undefined (missing data, or undefined function values), or exceed the given x-, y- or z-ranges. Such points can either be plotted nevertheless, or taken out of the input data set. All surface elements touching a point that is taken out will be taken out as well, thus creating a hole in the surface. If <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>level<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> = 3, equivalent to option <b>noundefined</b>, no points will be thrown away at all. This may produce all kinds of problems elsewhere, so you should avoid this. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>level<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> = 2 will throw away undefined points, but keep the out-of-range ones. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>level<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> = 1, the default, will get rid of out-of-range points as well. </p>
<p> By specifying <b>noaltdiagonal</b>, you can override the default handling of a special case can occur if <b>undefined</b> is active (i.e. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>level<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is not 3). Each cell of the grid-structured input surface will be divided in two triangles along one of its diagonals. Normally, all these diagonals have the same orientation relative to the grid. If exactly one of the four cell corners is excluded by the <b>undefined</b> handler, and this is on the usual diagonal, both triangles will be excluded. However if the default setting of <b>altdiagonal</b> is active, the other diagonal will be chosen for this cell instead, minimizing the size of the hole in the surface. </p>
<p> The <b>bentover</b> option controls what happens to another special case, this time in conjunction with the <b>trianglepattern</b>. For rather crumply surfaces, it can happen that the two triangles a surface cell is divided into are seen from opposite sides (i.e. the original quadrangle is 'bent over'), as illustrated in the following ASCII art: </p>
<pre>
                                                          C----B

                                                          A    D</pre>  <p> If the diagonal edges of the surface cells aren't generally made visible by bit 2 of the <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>bitpattern<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> there, the edge CB above wouldn't be drawn at all, normally, making the resulting display hard to understand. Therefore, the default option of <b>bentover</b> will turn it visible in this case. If you don't want that, you may choose <b>nobentover</b> instead.

<h2 id="SECTION0402935000000000000000">Isosamples</h2>  The isoline density (grid) for plotting functions as surfaces may be changed by the <b>set isosamples</b> command. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set isosamples &lt;iso_1&gt; {,&lt;iso_2&gt;}
show isosamples</pre>  <p> Each function surface plot will have <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>iso_1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> iso-u lines and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>iso_2<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> iso-v lines. If you only specify <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>iso_1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>iso_2<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> will be set to the same value as <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>iso_1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. By default, sampling is set to 10 isolines per u or v axis. A higher sampling rate will produce more accurate plots, but will take longer. These parameters have no effect on data file plotting. </p>
<p> An isoline is a curve parameterized by one of the surface parameters while the other surface parameter is fixed. Isolines provide a simple means to display a surface. By fixing the u parameter of surface s(u,v), the iso-u lines of the form c(v) = s(u0,v) are produced, and by fixing the v parameter, the iso-v lines of the form c(u) = s(u,v0) are produced. </p>
<p> When a function surface plot is being done without the removal of hidden lines, <b>set samples</b> controls the number of points sampled along each isoline; see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_samples">set samples</a></b> and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_hidden3d">set hidden3d</a></b>. The contour algorithm assumes that a function sample occurs at each isoline intersection, so change in <b>samples</b> as well as <b>isosamples</b> may be desired when changing the resolution of a function surface/contour. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402936000000000000000">Isosurface</h2> Syntax:  <pre>
set isosurface {mixed|triangles}
set isosurface {no}insidecolor &lt;n&gt;</pre>  Surfaces plotted by the command <b>splot $voxelgrid with isosurface</b> are by default constructed from a mixture of quadrangles and triangles. The use of quadrangles creates a less complicated visual impression. This is the default. This command proveds an option to tessellate with only triangles. <p> By default the inside of an isosurface is drawn in a separate color. The method of choosing that color is the same as for hidden3d surfaces, where an offset <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is added to the base linetype. To draw both the inside and outside surfaces in the same color, use <b>set isosurface noinsidecolor</b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402937000000000000000">Jitter</h2>   Syntax:  <pre>
set jitter {overlap &lt;yposition&gt;} {spread &lt;factor&gt;} {wrap &lt;limit&gt;}
           {swarm|square|vertical}</pre>  Examples:  <pre>
set jitter                    # jitter points within 1 character width
set jitter overlap 1.5        # jitter points within 1.5 character width
set jitter over 1.5 spread 0.5  # same but half the displacement on x</pre>  <p> When one or both coordinates of a data set are restricted to discrete values then many points may lie exactly on top of each other. Jittering introduces an offset to the coordinates of these superimposed points that spreads them into a cluster. The threshold value for treating the points as being overlapped may be specified in character widths or any of the usual coordinate options. See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b>. Jitter affects 2D plot styles <b>with points</b> and <b>with impulses</b>. It also affects 3D plotting of voxel grids. </p>
<p> The default jittering operation displaces points only along x. This produces a distinctive pattern sometimes called a <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>bee swarm plot<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. The optional keyword <b>square</b> adjusts the y coordinate of displaced points in addition to their x coordinate so that the points lie in distinct layers separated by at least the <b>overlap</b> distance. </p>
<p> To jitter along y (only) rather than along x, use keyword <b>vertical</b>. </p>
<p> The maximum displacement (in character units) can be limited using the <b>wrap</b> keyword. </p>
<p> Note that both the overlap criterion and the magnitude of jitter default to one character unit. Thus the plot appearance will change with the terminal font size, canvas size, or zoom factor. To avoid this you can specify the overlap criterion in the y axis coordinate system (the <b>first</b> keyword) and adjust the point size and spread multiplier as appropriate. See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#pointsize">pointsize</a></b>. </p>
<p> Caveat: jitter is incompatible with <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pointsize variable<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> <b>set jitter</b> is also useful in 3D plots of voxel data. Because voxel grids are regular lattices of evenly spaced points, many view angles cause points to overlap and/or generate Moiré patterns. These artifacts can be removed by displacing the symbol drawn at each grid point by a random amount. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402938000000000000000">Key</h2>    The <b>set key</b> command enables a key (or legend) containing a title and a sample (line, point, box) for each plot in the graph. The key may be turned off by requesting <b>set key off</b> or <b>unset key</b>. Individual key entries may be turned off by using the <b>notitle</b> keyword in the corresponding plot command. The text of the titles is controlled by the <b>set key autotitle</b> option or by the <b>title</b> keyword of individual <b>plot</b> and <b>splot</b> commands. See <b><a href="plot.html#plot_title">plot title</a></b> for more information. <p> Syntax:  </p>

show key</pre>  <p> Elements within the key are stacked according to <b>vertical</b> or <b>horizontal</b>. In the case of <b>vertical</b>, the key occupies as few columns as possible. That is, elements are aligned in a column until running out of vertical space at which point a new column is started. The vertical space may be limited using 'maxrows'. In the case of <b>horizontal</b>, the key occupies as few rows as possible. The horizontal space may be limited using 'maxcols'. </p>
<p> By default the key is placed in the upper right inside corner of the graph. The keywords <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>top</b>, <b>bottom</b>, <b>center</b>, <b>inside</b>, <b>outside</b>, <b>lmargin</b>, <b>rmargin</b>, <b>tmargin</b>, <b>bmargin</b> (, <b>above</b>, <b>over</b>, <b>below</b> and <b>under</b>) may be used to automatically place the key in other positions of the graph. Also an <b>at <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>position<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> may be given to indicate precisely where the plot should be placed. In this case, the keywords <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>top</b>, <b>bottom</b> and <b>center</b> serve an analogous purpose for alignment. For more information, see <b><a href="set_show.html#key_placement">key placement</a></b>. </p>
<p> Justification of the plot titles within the key is controlled by <b>Left</b> or <b>Right</b> (default). The text and sample can be reversed (<b>reverse</b>) and a box can be drawn around the key (<b>box {...}</b>) in a specified <b>linetype</b> and <b>linewidth</b>, or a user-defined <b>linestyle</b>. </p>
<p> The text in the key is set in <b>enhanced</b> mode by default, this can be changed with the <b>{no}enhanced</b> option, also independently for the key title only and for each individual plot. </p>
<p> By default the key is built up one plot at a time. That is, the key symbol and title are drawn at the same time as the corresponding plot. That means newer plots may sometimes place elements on top of the key. <b>set key opaque</b> causes the key to be generated after all the plots. In this case the key area is filled with background color or the requested fill color and then the key symbols and titles are written. The default can be restored by <b>set key noopaque</b>. </p>
<p> By default the first plot label is at the top of the key and successive labels are entered below it. The <b>invert</b> option causes the first label to be placed at the bottom of the key, with successive labels entered above it. This option is useful to force the vertical ordering of labels in the key to match the order of box types in a stacked histogram. </p>
<p> The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>height_increment<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is a number of character heights to be added to or subtracted from the height of the key box. This is useful mainly when you are putting a box around the key and want larger borders around the key entries. </p>
<p> An overall title can be put on the key (<b>title <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>text<span class="MATH">&gt;</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b>) — see also <b><a href="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</a></b> for the distinction between text in single- or double-quotes. The justification of the title defaults to center and can be changed by the keywords <b>right</b> or <b>left</b> </p>
<p> The defaults for <b>set key</b> are <b>on</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>top</b>, <b>vertical</b>, <b>Right</b>, <b>noreverse</b>, <b>noinvert</b>, <b>samplen 4</b>, <b>spacing 1</b>, <b>notitle</b>, and <b>nobox</b>. The default <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>linetype<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is the same as that used for the plot borders. Entering <b>set key default</b> returns the key to its default configuration. </p>
<p> Each plot is represented in the key by a single line containing a line or symbol or shape representing the plot style and a corresponding title. Using the keyword <b>notitle</b> in the plot command will suppress generation of the line. Contour plots generated additional entries in the key, one for each contour (see <b><a href="set_show.html#cntrlabel">cntrlabel</a></b>). You can add extra lines to the key by inserting a dummy plot command that uses the keyword <b>keyentry</b> rather than a filename or a function. See <b><a href="set_show.html#keyentry">keyentry</a></b>. </p>
<p> When using the TeX/LaTeX group of terminals or terminals in which formatting information is embedded in the string, <b>gnuplot</b> can only estimate the width of the string for key positioning. If the key is to be positioned at the left, it may be convenient to use the combination <b>set key left Left reverse</b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402938100000000000000">3D key</h3> Placement of the key for 3D plots (<b>splot</b>) by default uses the <b>fixed</b> option. Note: this is a change from gnuplot version 5.0 and earlier. <b>fixed</b> placement is very similar to <b>inside</b> placement with one important difference. The plot boundaries of a 3D plot change as the view point is rotated or scaled. If the key is positioned <b>inside</b> these boundaries then the key also moves when the view is changed. <b>fixed</b> positioning ignores changes to the view angles or scaling; i.e. the key remains fixed in one location on the canvas as the plot is rotated. <p> For 2D plots the <b>fixed</b> option is exactly equivalent to <b>inside</b>. </p>
<p> If <b>splot</b> is being used to draw contours, by default a separate key entry is generated for each contour level with a distinct line type. To modify this see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_cntrlabel">set cntrlabel</a></b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402938200000000000000">Key examples</h3> This places the key at the default location:  <pre>
set key default</pre>  <p> This disables the key:  </p>
<pre>
unset key</pre>  <p> This places a key at coordinates 2,3.5,2 in the default (first) coordinate system:  </p>
<pre>
set key at 2,3.5,2</pre>  <p> This places the key below the graph:  </p>
<pre>
set key below</pre>  <p> This places the key in the bottom left corner, left-justifies the text, gives it a title, and draws a box around it in linetype 3:  </p>
<pre>
set key left bottom Left title 'Legend' box 3</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION0402938300000000000000">Extra key entries</h3>  Normally each plot autogenerates a single line entry in the key. If you need more control over what appears in the key you can use the <b>keyentry</b> keyword in the <b>plot</b> or <b>splot</b> command to insert extra lines. Instead of providing a filename or function to plot, use <b>keyentry</b> as a placeholder followed by plot style information (used to generate a key symbol) and a title. All the usual options for title font, text color, <b>at</b> coordinates, and enhanced text markup apply. Example:  <pre>
plot $HEATMAP matrix with image notitle, \
     keyentry with boxes fc palette cb 0 title "no effect", \
     keyentry with boxes fc palette cb 1 title "threshold", \
     keyentry with boxes fc palette cb 3 title "typical range", \
     keyentry with labels nopoint title "as reported in [12]", \
     keyentry with boxes fc palette cb 5 title "strong effect"</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION0402938400000000000000">Key autotitle</h3>  <b>set key autotitle</b> causes each plot to be identified in the key by the name of the data file or function used in the plot command. This is the default. <b>set key noautotitle</b> disables the automatic generation of plot titles.  The command <b>set key autotitle columnheader</b> causes the first entry in each column of input data to be interpreted as a text string and used as a title for the corresponding plot. If the quantity being plotted is a function of data from several columns, gnuplot may be confused as to which column to draw the title from. In this case it is necessary to specify the column explicitly in the plot command, e.g. <pre>
plot "datafile" using (($2+$3)/$4) title columnhead(3) with lines</pre>  <p> Note: The effect of <b>set key autotitle columnheader</b>, treatment of the first line in a data file as column headers rather than data applies even if the key is disabled by <b>unset key</b>. It also applies to <b>stats</b> and <b>fit</b> commands even though they generate no key. If you want the first line of data to be treated as column headers but <em>not</em> to use them for plot titles, use <b>set datafile columnheaders</b>. </p>
<p> In all cases an explicit <b>title</b> or <b>notitle</b> keyword in the plot command itself will override the default from <b>set key autotitle</b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402938500000000000000">Key placement</h3> This section describes placement of the primary, auto-generated key. To construct a secondary key or place plot titles elsewhere, see <b><a href="set_show.html#multiple_keys">multiple keys</a></b>. <p> To understand positioning, the best concept is to think of a region, i.e., inside/outside, or one of the margins. Along with the region, keywords <b>left/center/right</b> (l/c/r) and <b>top/center/bottom</b> (t/c/b) control where within the particular region the key should be placed. </p>
<p> When in <b>inside</b> mode, the keywords <b>left</b> (l), <b>right</b> (r), <b>top</b> (t), <b>bottom</b> (b), and <b>center</b> (c) push the key out toward the plot boundary as illustrated: </p>
<pre>
t/l   t/c   t/r</pre>  <pre>
c/l    c    c/r</pre>  <pre>
b/l   b/c   b/r</pre>  <p> When in <b>outside</b> mode, automatic placement is similar to the above illustration, but with respect to the view, rather than the graph boundary. That is, a border is moved inward to make room for the key outside of the plotting area, although this may interfere with other labels and may cause an error on some devices. The particular plot border that is moved depends upon the position described above and the stacking direction. For options centered in one of the dimensions, there is no ambiguity about which border to move. For the corners, when the stack direction is <b>vertical</b>, the left or right border is moved inward appropriately. When the stack direction is <b>horizontal</b>, the top or bottom border is moved inward appropriately. </p>
<p> The margin syntax allows automatic placement of key regardless of stack direction. When one of the margins <b>lmargin</b> (lm), <b>rmargin</b> (rm), <b>tmargin</b> (tm), and <b>bmargin</b> (bm) is combined with a single, non-conflicting direction keyword, the following illustrated positions may contain the key: </p>
<pre>
l/tm  c/tm  r/tm</pre>  <pre>
t/lm                  t/rm</pre>  <pre>
c/lm                  c/rm</pre>  <pre>
b/lm                  b/rm</pre>  <pre>
l/bm  c/bm  r/bm</pre>  <p> Keywords <b>above</b> and <b>over</b> are synonymous with <b>tmargin</b>. For version compatibility, <b>above</b> or <b>over</b> without an additional l/c/r or stack direction keyword uses <b>center</b> and <b>horizontal</b>. Keywords <b>below</b> and <b>under</b> are synonymous with <b>bmargin</b>. For compatibility, <b>below</b> or <b>under</b> without an additional l/c/r or stack direction keyword uses <b>center</b> and <b>horizontal</b>. A further compatibility issue is that <b>outside</b> appearing without an additional t/b/c or stack direction keyword uses <b>top</b>, <b>right</b> and <b>vertical</b> (i.e., the same as t/rm above). </p>
<p> The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>position<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> can be a simple x,y,z as in previous versions, but these can be preceded by one of five keywords (<b>first</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>graph</b>, <b>screen</b>, <b>character</b>) which selects the coordinate system in which the position of the first sample line is specified. See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b> for more details. The effect of <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>top</b>, <b>bottom</b>, and <b>center</b> when <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>position<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is given is to align the key as though it were text positioned using the label command, i.e., <b>left</b> means left align with key to the right of <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>position<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, etc. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402938600000000000000">Key samples</h3> By default, each plot on the graph generates a corresponding entry in the key. This entry contains a plot title and a sample line/point/box of the same color and fill properties as used in the plot itself. The font and textcolor properties control the appearance of the individual plot titles that appear in the key. Setting the textcolor to <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>variable<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> causes the text for each key entry to be the same color as the line or fill color for that plot. This was the default in some earlier versions of gnuplot. <p> The length of the sample line can be controlled by <b>samplen</b>. The sample length is computed as the sum of the tic length and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>sample_length<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> times the character width. <b>samplen</b> also affects the positions of point samples in the key since these are drawn at the midpoint of the sample line, even if the sample line itself is not drawn. </p>
<p> Key entry lines are single-spaced based on the current font size. This can be adjusted by <b>set key spacing <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>line-spacing<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. </p>
<p> The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>width_increment<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is a number of character widths to be added to or subtracted from the length of the string. This is useful only when you are putting a box around the key and you are using control characters in the text. <b>gnuplot</b> simply counts the number of characters in the string when computing the box width; this allows you to correct it. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402938700000000000000">Multiple keys</h3>  It is possible to construct a legend/key manually rather than having the plot titles all appear in the auto-generated key. This allows, for example, creating a single legend for the component panels in a multiplot. Here is an example:  <pre>
set multiplot layout 3,2 columnsfirst
set style data boxes
plot $D using 0:6  lt 1 title at 0.75, 0.20
plot $D using 0:12 lt 2 title at 0.75, 0.17
plot $D using 0:13 lt 3 title at 0.75, 0.14
plot $D using 0:14 lt 4 title at 0.75, 0.11
set label 1 at screen 0.75, screen 0.22 "Custom combined key area"
plot $D using 0:($6+$12+$13+$14) with linespoints title "total"

See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b> for details. </p>
<p> The tag is an integer that is used to identify the label. If no <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>tag<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is given, the lowest unused tag value is assigned automatically. The tag can be used to delete or modify a specific label. To change any attribute of an existing label, use the <b>set label</b> command with the appropriate tag, and specify the parts of the label to be changed. </p>
<p> The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>label text<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> can be a string constant, a string variable, or a string- valued expression. See <b><a href="string_constants_string_var.html#strings">strings</a></b>, <b><a href="expressions.html#sprintf">sprintf</a></b>, and <b><a href="set_show.html#gprintf">gprintf</a></b>. </p>
<p> By default, the text is placed flush left against the point x,y,z. To adjust the way the label is positioned with respect to the point x,y,z, add the justification parameter, which may be <b>left</b>, <b>right</b> or <b>center</b>, indicating that the point is to be at the left, right or center of the text. Labels outside the plotted boundaries are permitted but may interfere with axis labels or other text. </p>
<p> Some terminals support enclosing the label in a box. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_style_textbox">set style textbox</a></b>. Not all terminals can handle boxes for rotated text. </p>
<p> If <b>rotate</b> is given, the label is written vertically. If <b>rotate by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>degrees<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> is given, the baseline of the text will be set to the specified angle. Some terminals do not support text rotation. </p>
<p> Font and its size can be chosen explicitly by <b>font <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>name<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>{,<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>size<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>}<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b> if the terminal supports font settings. Otherwise the default font of the terminal will be used. </p>
<p> Normally the enhanced text mode string interpretation, if enabled for the current terminal, is applied to all text strings including label text. The <b>noenhanced</b> property can be used to exempt a specific label from the enhanced text mode processing. The can be useful if the label contains underscores, for example. See <b><a href="enhanced_text_mode.html#enhanced_text">enhanced text</a></b>. </p>
<p> If <b>front</b> is given, the label is written on top of the graphed data. If <b>back</b> is given (the default), the label is written underneath the graphed data. Using <b>front</b> will prevent a label from being obscured by dense data. </p>
<p> <b>textcolor <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>colorspec<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> changes the color of the label text. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>colorspec<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> can be a linetype, an rgb color, or a palette mapping. See help for <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles.html#colorspec">colorspec</a></b> and <b><a href="expressions.html#palette">palette</a></b>. <b>textcolor</b> may be abbreviated <b>tc</b>.  </p>
<pre>
`tc default` resets the text color to its default state.
`tc lt &lt;n&gt;` sets the text color to that of line type &lt;n&gt;.
`tc ls &lt;n&gt;` sets the text color to that of line style &lt;n&gt;.
`tc palette z` selects a palette color corresponding to the label z position.
`tc palette cb &lt;val&gt;` selects a color corresponding to &lt;val&gt; on the colorbar.
`tc palette fraction &lt;val&gt;`, with 0&lt;=val&lt;=1, selects a color corresponding to
    the mapping [0:1] to grays/colors of the `palette`.
`tc rgb "#RRGGBB"` or `tc rgb "0xRRGGBB"` sets an arbitrary 24-bit RGB color.
`tc rgb 0xRRGGBB`  As above; a hexadecimal constant does not require quotes.</pre>  <p> If a <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>pointstyle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is given, using keywords <b>lt</b>, <b>pt</b> and <b>ps</b>, see <b><a href="plot.html#style">style</a></b>, a point with the given style and color of the given line type is plotted at the label position and the text of the label is displaced slightly. This option is used by default for placing labels in <b>mouse</b> enhanced terminals. Use <b>nopoint</b> to turn off the drawing of a point near the label (this is the default). </p>
<p> The displacement defaults to 1,1 in <b>pointsize</b> units if a <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>pointstyle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is given, 0,0 if no <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>pointstyle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is given. The displacement can be controlled by the optional <b>offset <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>offset<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> where <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>offset<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is specified by either x,y or x,y,z, and may be preceded by <b>first</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>graph</b>, <b>screen</b>, or <b>character</b> to select the coordinate system. See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b> for details. </p>
<p> If one (or more) axis is timeseries, the appropriate coordinate should be given as a quoted time string according to the <b>timefmt</b> format string. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xdata">set xdata</a></b> and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_timefmt">set timefmt</a></b>. </p>
<p> The options available for <b>set label</b> are also available for the <b>labels</b> plot style. See <b><a href="labels.html#labels">labels</a></b>. In this case the properties <b>textcolor</b>, <b>rotate</b>, and <b>pointsize</b> may be followed by keyword <b>variable</b> rather than by a fixed value. In this case the corresponding property of individual labels is determined by additional columns in the <b>using</b> specifier. </p>

When the mouse hovers over the anchor point, a pop-up box containing the text is displayed. Terminals that do not support hypertext will display nothing. You must enable the <b>point</b> attribute of the label in order for the hypertext to be anchored. Examples:  <pre>
set label at 0,0 "Plot origin" hypertext point pt 1
plot 'data' using 1:2:0 with labels hypertext point pt 7 \
     title 'mouse over point to see its order in data set'</pre>  <p> For the wxt and qt terminals, left-click on a hypertext anchor after the text has appeared will copy the hypertext to the clipboard. </p>
<p> EXPERIMENTAL (implementation details may change) Text of the form <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>image{<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>xsize<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>,<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ysize<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>}:<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>filename<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>{ <span class="MATH">\</span>n<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>caption text<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>}<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> will trigger display of the image file in a pop-up box. The optional size overrides a default box size 300x200. The types of image file recognized may vary by terminal type, but *.png should always work. Any additional text lines following the image filename are displayed as usual for hypertext. Example:  </p>
<pre>
set label 7 "image:../figures/Fig7_inset.png\nFigure 7 caption..."
set label 7 at 10,100 hypertext point pt 7</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION0402940000000000000000">Linetype</h2>  The <b>set linetype</b> command allows you to redefine the basic linetypes used for plots. The command options are identical to those for <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>set style line<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. Unlike line styles, redefinitions by <b>set linetype</b> are persistent; they are not affected by <b>reset</b>. <p> For example, whatever linetypes one and two look like to begin with, if you redefine them like this: </p>
<pre>
set linetype 1 lw 2 lc rgb "blue" pointtype 6
set linetype 2 lw 2 lc rgb "forest-green" pointtype 8</pre>  <p> everywhere that uses lt 1 will now get a thick blue line. This includes uses such as the definition of a temporary linestyle derived from the base linetype 1. Similarly lt 2 will now produce a thick green line. </p>
<p> This mechanism can be used to define a set of personal preferences for the sequence of lines used in gnuplot. The recommended way to do this is to add to the run-time initialization file ˜ /.gnuplot a sequence of commands like </p>
<pre>
set linetype 1 lc rgb "dark-violet" lw 2 pt 1
set linetype 2 lc rgb "sea-green"   lw 2 pt 7
set linetype 3 lc rgb "cyan"        lw 2 pt 6 pi -1
set linetype 4 lc rgb "dark-red"    lw 2 pt 5 pi -1
set linetype 5 lc rgb "blue"        lw 2 pt 8
set linetype 6 lc rgb "dark-orange" lw 2 pt 3
set linetype 7 lc rgb "black"       lw 2 pt 11
set linetype 8 lc rgb "goldenrod"   lw 2
set linetype cycle 8</pre>  <p> Every time you run gnuplot the line types will be initialized to these values. You may initialize as many linetypes as you like. If you do not redefine, say, linetype 3 then it will continue to have the default properties (in this case blue, pt 3, lw 1, etc). </p>
<p> Similar script files can be used to define theme-based color choices, or sets of colors optimized for a particular plot type or output device. </p>
<p>  The command <b>set linetype cycle 8</b> tells gnuplot to re-use these definitions for the color and linewidth of higher-numbered linetypes. That is, linetypes 9-16, 17-24, and so on will use this same sequence of colors and widths. The point properties (pointtype, pointsize, pointinterval) are not affected by this command. <b>unset linetype cycle</b> disables this feature. If the line properties of a higher numbered linetype are explicitly defined, this takes precedence over the recycled low-number linetype properties. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402941000000000000000">Link</h2>  Syntax:  <pre>
set link {x2 | y2} {via &lt;expression1&gt; inverse &lt;expression2&gt;}
unset link</pre>  <p> The <b>set link</b> command establishes a mapping between the x and x2 axes, or the y and y2 axes. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>expression1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> maps primary axis coordinates onto the secondary axis. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>expression2<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> maps secondary axis coordinates onto the primary axis. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<pre>
set link x2</pre>  <p> This is the simplest form of the command. It forces the x2 axis to have identically the same range, scale, and direction as the x axis. Commands <b>set xrange</b>, <b>set x2range</b>, <b>set auto x</b>, etc will affect both the x and x2 axes. </p>
<pre>
set link x2 via x**2 inverse sqrt(x)
plot "sqrt_data" using 1:2 axes x2y1, "linear_data" using 1:2 axes x1y1</pre>  <p> This command establishes forward and reverse mapping between the x and x2 axes. The forward mapping is used to generate x2 tic labels and x2 mouse coordinate The reverse mapping is used to plot coordinates given in the x2 coordinate system. Note that the mapping as given is valid only for x non-negative. When mapping to the y2 axis, both <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>expression1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>expression2<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> must use y as dummy variable. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402942000000000000000">Lmargin</h2>  The command <b>set lmargin</b> sets the size of the left margin. Please see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_margin">set margin</a></b> for details. <h2 id="SECTION0402943000000000000000">Loadpath</h2>  The <b>loadpath</b> setting defines additional locations for data and command files searched by the <b>call</b>, <b>load</b>, <b>plot</b> and <b>splot</b> commands. If a file cannot be found in the current directory, the directories in <b>loadpath</b> are tried. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set loadpath {"pathlist1" {"pathlist2"...}}
show loadpath</pre>  <p> Path names may be entered as single directory names, or as a list of path names separated by a platform-specific path separator, eg. colon (':') on Unix, semicolon (';') on DOS/Windows/OS/2 platforms. The <b>show loadpath</b>, <b>save</b> and <b>save set</b> commands replace the platform-specific separator with a space character (' '). </p>
<p> If the environment variable GNUPLOT_LIB is set, its contents are appended to <b>loadpath</b>. However, <b>show loadpath</b> prints the contents of <b>set loadpath</b> and GNUPLOT_LIB separately. Also, the <b>save</b> and <b>save set</b> commands ignore the contents of GNUPLOT_LIB. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402944000000000000000">Locale</h2>  The <b>locale</b> setting determines the language with which <b>{x,y,z}{d,m}tics</b> will write the days and months. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set locale {"&lt;locale&gt;"}</pre>  <p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>locale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> may be any language designation acceptable to your installation. See your system documentation for the available options. The command <b>set locale <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b> will try to determine the locale from the LC_TIME, LC_ALL, or LANG environment variables. </p>
<p> To change the decimal point locale, see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_decimalsign">set decimalsign</a></b>. To change the character encoding to the current locale, see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_encoding">set encoding</a></b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402945000000000000000">Logscale</h2>   Syntax:  <pre>

unset logscale &lt;axes&gt;
show logscale</pre>  <p> where <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>axes<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> may be any combinations of <b>x</b>, <b>x2</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>y2</b>, <b>z</b>, <b>cb</b>, and <b>r</b> in any order. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>base<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is the base of the log scaling (default is base 10). If no axes are specified, the command affects all axes except <b>r</b>. The command <b>unset logscale</b> turns off log scaling for all axes. Note that the ticmarks generated for logscaled axes are not uniformly spaced. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xtics">set xtics</a></b>. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>

<pre>
set mapping {cartesian | spherical | cylindrical}</pre>  <p> A cartesian coordinate system is used by default. </p>
<p> For a spherical coordinate system, the data occupy two or three columns (or <b>using</b> entries). The first two are interpreted as the azimuthal and polar angles theta and phi (or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>longitude<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>latitude<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>), in the units specified by <b>set angles</b>. The radius r is taken from the third column if there is one, or is set to unity if there is no third column. The mapping is: </p>
<pre>
x = r * cos(theta) * cos(phi)
y = r * sin(theta) * cos(phi)
z = r * sin(phi)</pre>  <p> Note that this is a <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>geographic<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> spherical system, rather than a <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>polar<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> one (that is, phi is measured from the equator, rather than the pole). </p>
<p> For a cylindrical coordinate system, the data again occupy two or three columns. The first two are interpreted as theta (in the units specified by <b>set angles</b>) and z. The radius is either taken from the third column or set to unity, as in the spherical case. The mapping is: </p>
<pre>
x = r * cos(theta)
y = r * sin(theta)
z = z</pre>  <p> The effects of <b>mapping</b> can be duplicated with the <b>using</b> filter on the <b>splot</b> command, but <b>mapping</b> may be more convenient if many data files are to be processed. However even if <b>mapping</b> is used, <b>using</b> may still be necessary if the data in the file are not in the required order. </p>
<p> <b>mapping</b> has no effect on <b>plot</b>. <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/world.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">world.dem: mapping demos. </span></a> </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402948000000000000000">Margin</h2>  The <b>margin</b> is the distance between the plot border and the outer edge of the canvas. The size of the margin is chosen automatically, but can be overridden by the <b>set margin</b> commands. <b>show margin</b> shows the current settings. To alter the distance between the inside of the plot border and the data in the plot itself, see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_offsets">set offsets</a></b>. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set lmargin {{at screen} &lt;margin&gt;}
set rmargin {{at screen} &lt;margin&gt;}
set tmargin {{at screen} &lt;margin&gt;}
set bmargin {{at screen} &lt;margin&gt;}
set margins &lt;left&gt;, &lt;right&gt;, &lt;bottom&gt;, &lt;top&gt;
show margin</pre>  <p> The default units of <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>margin<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> are character heights or widths, as appropriate. A positive value defines the absolute size of the margin. A negative value (or none) causes <b>gnuplot</b> to revert to the computed value. For 3D plots, only the left margin can be set using character units. </p>
<p> The keywords <b>at screen</b> indicates that the margin is specified as a fraction of the full drawing area. This can be used to precisely line up the corners of individual 2D and 3D graphs in a multiplot. This placement ignores the current values of <b>set origin</b> and <b>set size</b>, and is intended as an alternative method for positioning graphs within a multiplot. </p>
<p> Normally the margins of a plot are automatically calculated based on tics, tic labels, axis labels, the plot title, the timestamp and the size of the key if it is outside the borders. If, however, tics are attached to the axes (<b>set xtics axis</b>, for example), neither the tics themselves nor their labels will be included in either the margin calculation or the calculation of the positions of other text to be written in the margin. This can lead to tic labels overwriting other text if the axis is very close to the border. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402949000000000000000">Micro</h2>  By default the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%c<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> format specifier for scientific notation used to generate axis tick labels uses a lower case u as a prefix to indicate <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>micro<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> (10<code>^</code>-6). The <b>set micro</b> command tells gnuplot to use a different typographic character (unicode U+00B5). The byte sequence used to represent this character depends on the current encoding. See <b><a href="set_show.html#format_specifiers">format specifiers</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#encoding">encoding</a></b>. <p> This command is EXPERIMENTAL. Implementation details may change. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402950000000000000000">Minussign</h2>  Gnuplot uses the C language library routine sprintf() for most formatted input. However it also has its own formatting routine <b>gprintf()</b> that is used to generate axis tic labels. The C library routine always use a hyphen character (ascii  <span class="MATH">\</span>055) to indicate a negative number, as in -7. Many people prefer a different typographic minus sign character (unicode U+2212) for this purpose, as in −7. The command <pre>
set minussign</pre>  <p> causes gprintf() to use this minus sign character rather than a hyphen in numeric output. In a utf-8 locale this is the multibyte sequence corresponding to unicode U+2212. In a Window codepage 1252 locale this is the 8-bit character ALT+150 (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>en dash<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>). The <b>set minussign</b> command will affect axis tic labels and any labels that are created by explicitly invoking gprintf. It has no effect on other strings that contain a hyphen. See <b><a href="set_show.html#gprintf">gprintf</a></b>. </p>
<p> Note that this command is ignored when you are using any of the LaTeX terminals, as LaTeX has its own mechanism for handling minus signs. It also is not necessary when using the postscript terminal because the postscript prologue output by gnuplot remaps the ascii hyphen code  <span class="MATH">\</span>055 to a different glyph named <b>minus</b>. </p>
<p> This command is EXPERIMENTAL. Implementation details may change. </p>
<p> Example (assumes utf8 locale): </p>
<pre>
set minus
A = -5
print "A = ",A                 # printed string will contain a hyphen
print gprintf("A = %g",A)      # printed string will contain character U+2212
set label "V = -5"             # label will contain a hyphen
set label sprintf("V = %g",-5) # label will contain a hyphen
set label gprintf("V = %g",-5) # label will contain character U+2212</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION0402951000000000000000">Monochrome</h2>  Syntax:  <pre>
set monochrome {linetype N &lt;linetype properties&gt;}</pre>  <p> The <b>set monochrome</b> command selects an alternative set of linetypes that differ by dot/dash pattern or line width rather than by color. This command replaces the monochrome option offered by certain terminal types in earlier versions of gnuplot. For backward compatibility these terminal types now implicitly invoke <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>set monochrome<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> if their own <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>mono<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> option is present. For example,  </p>
<pre>
set terminal pdf mono</pre>  is equivalent to  <pre>
set terminal pdf
set mono</pre>  <p> Selecting monochrome mode does not prevent you from explicitly drawing lines using RGB or palette colors, but see also <b><a href="set_show.html#set_palette_gray">set palette gray</a></b>. Six monochrome linetypes are defined by default. You can change their properties or add additional monochrome linetypes by using the full form of the command. Changes made to the monochrome linetypes do not affect the color linetypes and vice versa. To restore the usual set of color linetypes, use either <b>unset monochrome</b> or <b>set color</b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402952000000000000000">Mouse</h2>    The command <b>set mouse</b> enables mouse actions for the current interactive terminal. It is usually enabled by default in interactive mode, but disabled by default if commands are being read from a file. <p> There are two mouse modes. The 2D mode works for <b>plot</b> commands and for <b>splot</b> maps (i.e. <b>set view</b> with z-rotation 0, 90, 180, 270 or 360 degrees, including <b>set view map</b>). In this mode the mouse position is tracked and you can pan or zoom using the mouse buttons or arrow keys. Some terminals support toggling individual plots on/off by clicking on the corresponding key title or on a separate widget. </p>
<p> For 3D graphs <b>splot</b>, the view and scaling of the graph can be changed with mouse buttons 1 and 2, respectively. A vertical motion of Button 2 with the shift key held down changes the <b>xyplane</b>. If additionally to these buttons the modifier <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ctrl<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is held down, the coordinate axes are displayed but the data are suppressed. This is useful for large data sets. Mouse button 3 controls the azimuth of the z axis (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_view_azimuth">set view azimuth</a></b>). </p>
<p> Mousing is not available inside multiplot mode. When multiplot is completed using <b>unset multiplot</b>, then the mouse will be turned on again but acts only on the most recent plot within the multiplot (like replot does). </p>
<p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set mouse {doubleclick &lt;ms&gt;} {nodoubleclick}
          {{no}zoomcoordinates}
          {zoomfactors &lt;xmultiplier&gt;, &lt;ymultiplier&gt;}
          {noruler | ruler {at x,y}}
          {polardistance{deg|tan} | nopolardistance}
          {format &lt;string&gt;}
          {mouseformat &lt;int&gt; | &lt;string&gt; | function &lt;f(x,y)&gt;}
          {{no}labels {"labeloptions"}}
          {{no}zoomjump} {{no}verbose}
unset mouse</pre>  <p> The options <b>noruler</b> and <b>ruler</b> switch the ruler off and on, the latter optionally setting the origin at the given coordinates. While the ruler is on, the distance in user units from the ruler origin to the mouse is displayed continuously. By default, toggling the ruler has the key binding 'r'. </p>
<p> The option <b>polardistance</b> determines if the distance between the mouse cursor and the ruler is also shown in polar coordinates (distance and angle in degrees or tangent (slope)). This corresponds to the default key binding '5'. </p>
<p>  Choose the option <b>labels</b> to define persistent gnuplot labels using Button 2. The default is <b>nolabels</b>, which makes Button 2 draw only a temporary label at the mouse position. Labels are drawn with the current setting of <b>mouseformat</b>. The <b>labeloptions</b> string is passed to the <b>set label</b> command. The default is <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>point pointstyle 1<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> which will plot a small plus at the label position. Temporary labels will disappear at the next <b>replot</b> or mouse zoom operation. Persistent labels can be removed by holding the Ctrl-Key down while clicking Button 2 on the label's point. The threshold for how close you must be to the label is also determined by the <b>pointsize</b>. </p>
<p> If the option <b>verbose</b> is turned on the communication commands are shown during execution. This option can also be toggled by hitting <b>6</b> in the driver's window. <b>verbose</b> is off by default. </p>
<p> Press 'h' in the driver's window for a short summary of the mouse and key bindings. This will also display user defined bindings or <b>hotkeys</b> which can be defined using the <b>bind</b> command, see help for <b><a href="mouse_input.html#bind">bind</a></b>. Note, that user defined <b>hotkeys</b> may override the default bindings. See also help for <b><a href="mouse_input.html#bind">bind</a></b> and <b><a href="set_show.html#label">label</a></b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402952100000000000000">Doubleclick</h3> The doubleclick resolution is given in milliseconds and used for Button 1, which copies the current mouse position to the <b>clipboard</b> on some terminals. The default value is 300 ms. Setting the value to 0 ms triggers the copy on a single click. <h3 id="SECTION0402952200000000000000">Format</h3> The <b>set mouse format</b> command specifies a format string for sprintf() which determines how the mouse cursor [x,y] coordinates are printed to the plot window and to the clipboard.

set mouse mouseformat i
set mouse mouseformat "custom format"
set mouse mouseformat function string_valued_function(x, y)</pre>  This command controls the format used to report the current mouse position. An integer argument selects one of the format options in the table below. A string argument is used as a format for sprintf() in option 7 and should contain two float specifiers, one for x and one for y. <p> Use of a custom function returning a string is EXPERIMENTAL. It allows readout of coordinate systems in which inverse mapping from screen coordinates to plot coordinates requires joint consideration of both x and y. See for example the map_projection demo. </p>

<pre>
set multiplot
    { title &lt;page title&gt; {font &lt;fontspec&gt;} {enhanced|noenhanced} }

      {spacing &lt;xspacing&gt;{,&lt;yspacing&gt;}}
    }
set multiplot {next|previous}
unset multiplot</pre>  <p> For some terminals, no plot is displayed until the command <b>unset multiplot</b> is given, which causes the entire page to be drawn and then returns gnuplot to its normal single-plot mode. For other terminals, each separate <b>plot</b> command produces an updated display. </p>
<p>  The <b>clear</b> command is used to erase the rectangular area of the page that will be used for the next plot. This is typically needed to inset a small plot inside a larger plot. </p>
<p> Any labels or arrows that have been defined will be drawn for each plot according to the current size and origin (unless their coordinates are defined in the <b>screen</b> system). Just about everything else that can be <b>set</b> is applied to each plot, too. If you want something to appear only once on the page, for instance a single time stamp, you'll need to put a <b>set time</b>/<b>unset time</b> pair around one of the <b>plot</b>, <b>splot</b> or <b>replot</b> commands within the <b>set multiplot</b>/<b>unset multiplot</b> block. </p>
<p> The multiplot title is separate from the individual plot titles, if any. Space is reserved for it at the top of the page, spanning the full width of the canvas. </p>
<p> The commands <b>set origin</b> and <b>set size</b> must be used to correctly position each plot if no layout is specified or if fine tuning is desired. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_origin">set origin</a></b> and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_size">set size</a></b> for details of their usage. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set multiplot
set size 0.4,0.4
set origin 0.1,0.1
plot sin(x)
set size 0.2,0.2
set origin 0.5,0.5
plot cos(x)
unset multiplot</pre>  <p> This displays a plot of cos(x) stacked above a plot of sin(x). </p>
<p> <b>set size</b> and <b>set origin</b> refer to the entire plotting area used for each plot. Please also see <b><a href="canvas_size.html#set_term_size">set term size</a></b>. If you want to have the axes themselves line up, you can guarantee that the margins are the same size with the <b>set margin</b> commands. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_margin">set margin</a></b> for their use. Note that the margin settings are absolute, in character units, so the appearance of the graph in the remaining space will depend on the screen size of the display device, e.g., perhaps quite different on a video display and a printer. </p>
<p> With the <b>layout</b> option you can generate simple multiplots without having to give the <b>set size</b> and <b>set origin</b> commands before each plot: Those are generated automatically, but can be overridden at any time. With <b>layout</b> the display will be divided by a grid with <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>rows<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> rows and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>cols<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> columns. This grid is filled rows first or columns first depending on whether the corresponding option is given in the multiplot command. The stack of plots can grow <b>downwards</b> or <b>upwards</b>. Default is <b>rowsfirst</b> and <b>downwards</b>. The commands <b>set multiplot next</b> and <b>set multiplot previous</b> are relevant only in the context of using the layout option. <b>next</b> skips the next position in the grid, leaving a blank space. <b>prev</b> returns to the grid position immediately preceding the most recently plotted position. </p>
<p> Each plot can be scaled by <b>scale</b> and shifted with <b>offset</b>; if the y-values for scale or offset are omitted, the x-value will be used. <b>unset multiplot</b> will turn off the automatic layout and restore the values of <b>set size</b> and <b>set origin</b> as they were before <b>set multiplot layout</b>. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set size 1,1
set origin 0,0
set multiplot layout 3,2 columnsfirst scale 1.1,0.9
[ up to 6 plot commands here ]
unset multiplot</pre>  <p> The above example will produce 6 plots in 2 columns filled top to bottom, left to right. Each plot will have a horizontal size of 1.1/2 and a vertical size of 0.9/3. </p>
<p> Another possibility is to set uniform margins for all plots in the layout with options <b>layout margins</b> and <b>spacing</b>, which must be used together. With <b>margins</b> you set the outer margins of the whole multiplot grid. </p>
<p> <b>spacing</b> gives the gap size between two adjacent subplots, and can also be given in <b>character</b> or <b>screen</b> units. If a single value is given, it is used for both x and y direction, otherwise two different values can be selected. </p>
<p> If one value has no unit, the one of the preceding margin setting is used. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set multiplot layout 2,2 margins 0.1, 0.9, 0.1, 0.9 spacing 0.0</pre>  <p> In this case the two left-most subplots will have left boundaries at screen coordinate 0.1, the two right-most subplots will have right boundaries at screen coordinate 0.9, and so on. Because the spacing between subplots is given as 0, their inner boundaries will superimpose. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set multiplot layout 2,2 margins char 5,1,1,2 spacing screen 0, char 2</pre>  <p> This produces a layout in which the boundary of both left subplots is 5 character widths from the left edge of the canvas, the right boundary of the right subplots is 1 character width from the canvas edge. The overall bottom margin is one character height and the overall top margin is 2 character heights. There is no horizontal gap between the two columns of subplots. The vertical gap between subplots is equal to 2 character heights. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set multiplot layout 2,2 columnsfirst margins 0.1,0.9,0.1,0.9 spacing 0.1
set ylabel 'ylabel'
plot sin(x)

<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>freq<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is the number of sub-intervals (NOT the number of minor tics) between major tics (the default for a linear axis is either two or five depending on the major tics, so there are one or four minor tics between major tics). Selecting <b>default</b> will return the number of minor ticks to its default value. </p>
<p> If the axis is logarithmic, the number of sub-intervals will be set to a reasonable number by default (based upon the length of a decade). This will be overridden if <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>freq<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is given. However the usual minor tics (2, 3, ..., 8, 9 between 1 and 10, for example) are obtained by setting <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>freq<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> to 10, even though there are but nine sub-intervals. </p>
<p> To set minor tics at arbitrary positions, use the (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>label<span class="MATH">&gt;</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>pos<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>level<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, ...) form of <b>set {x<span class="MATH">|</span>x2<span class="MATH">|</span>y<span class="MATH">|</span>y2<span class="MATH">|</span>z}tics</b> with <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>label<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> empty and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>level<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> set to 1. </p>
<p> The <b>set m{x<span class="MATH">|</span>x2<span class="MATH">|</span>y<span class="MATH">|</span>y2<span class="MATH">|</span>z}tics</b> commands work only when there are uniformly spaced major tics.

set nonlinear &lt;axis&gt; via f(axis) inverse g(axis)
unset nonlinear &lt;axis&gt;</pre>  <p> This command is similar to the <b>set link</b> command except that only one of the two linked axes is visible. The hidden axis remains linear. Coordinates along the visible axis are mapped by applying g(x) to hidden axis coordinates. f(x) maps the visible axis coordinates back onto the hidden linear axis.

set nonlinear x via f(x) inverse g(x)
set xtics add (100,500)

X coordinates 0-100 are at the left, X coordinates 500-1000 are at the right, there is a small gap (10 units) between them.

set object &lt;index&gt; ellipse {at|center} &lt;position&gt; size &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
    {angle &lt;orientation&gt;} {units xy|xx|yy}
    {&lt;other-object-properties&gt;}</pre>  <p> The position of the ellipse is specified by giving the center followed by the width and the height (actually the major and minor axes). The keywords <b>at</b> and <b>center</b> are synonyms. The center position may be given in axis, graph, or screen coordinates. See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b>. The major and minor axis lengths must be given in axis coordinates. The orientation of the ellipse is specified by the angle between the horizontal axis and the major diameter of the ellipse. If no angle is given, the default ellipse orientation will be used instead (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_style_ellipse">set style ellipse</a></b>). The <b>units</b> keyword controls the scaling of the axes of the ellipse. <b>units xy</b> means that the major axis is interpreted in terms of units along the x axis, while the minor axis in that of the y axis. <b>units xx</b> means that both axes of the ellipses are scaled in the units of the x axis, while <b>units yy</b> means that both axes are in units of the y axis. The default is <b>xy</b> or whatever <b>set style ellipse units</b> was set to. </p>
<p> NB: If the x and y axis scales are not equal, (e.g. <b>units xy</b> is in effect) then the major/minor axis ratio will no longer be correct after rotation. </p>
<p> Note that <b>set object ellipse size <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>2r<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>,<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>2r<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> does not in general produce the same result as <b>set object circle <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>r<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. The circle radius is always interpreted in terms of units along the x axis, and will always produce a circle even if the x and y axis scales are different and even if the aspect ratio of your plot is not 1. If <b>units</b> is set to <b>xy</b>, then 'set object ellipse' interprets the first <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>2r<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> in terms of x axis units and the second <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>2r<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> in terms of y axis units. This will only produce a circle if the x and y axis scales are identical and the plot aspect ratio is 1. On the other hand, if <b>units</b> is set to <b>xx</b> or <b>yy</b>, then the diameters specified in the 'set object' command will be interpreted in the same units, so the ellipse will have the correct aspect ratio, and it will maintain its aspect ratio even if the plot is resized. </p>

    {&lt;other-object-properties&gt;}</pre>  <p> The position of the circle is specified by giving the position of the center center followed by the radius. The keywords <b>at</b> and <b>center</b> are synonyms. In 2D plots the position and radius may be given in any coordinate system. See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b>. Circles in 3D plots cannot use graph coordinates. In all cases the radius is calculated relative to the horizontal scale of the axis, graph, or canvas. Any disparity between the horizontal and vertical scaling will be corrected for so that the result is always a circle. If you want to draw a circle in plot coordinates (such that it will appear as an ellipse if the horizontal and vertical scales are different), use <b>set object ellipse</b> instead. </p>

Rather than assigning the object to layer front/back/behind it is included in the list of pm3d quadrangles sorted and rendered in order of depth by <b>set pm3d depthorder</b>. As with pm3d surfaces, two-sided coloring can be generated by specifying the object fillcolor as a linestyle. In this case the ordering of the first three vertices in the polygon determines the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>side<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. <p> If you set this property for an object that is not a 3D polygon it probably will not be drawn at all. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402962000000000000000">Offsets</h2>   Autoscaling sets the x and y axis ranges to match the coordinates of the data that is plotted. Offsets provide a mechanism to expand these ranges to leave empty space between the data and the plot borders. Autoscaling then further extends each range to reach the next axis tic unless this has been suppressed by <b>set autoscale noextend</b> or <b>set xrange noextend</b>. See <b><a href="set_show.html#noextend">noextend</a></b>. Offsets affect only scaling for the x1 and y1 axes. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set offsets &lt;left&gt;, &lt;right&gt;, &lt;top&gt;, &lt;bottom&gt;
unset offsets
show offsets</pre>  <p> Each offset may be a constant or an expression. Each defaults to 0. By default, the left and right offsets are given in units of the first x axis, the top and bottom offsets in units of the first y axis. Alternatively, you may specify the offsets as a fraction of the total graph dimension by using the keyword <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>graph<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. Only <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>graph<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> offsets are possible for nonlinear axes. </p>
<p> A positive offset expands the axis range in the specified direction, e.g. a positive bottom offset makes ymin more negative. Negative offsets interact badly with autoscaling and clipping. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set autoscale noextend
set offsets graph 0.05, 0, 2, 2
plot sin(x)</pre>  <p> This graph of sin(x) will have y range [-3:3] because the function will be autoscaled to [-1:1] and the vertical offsets add 2 at each end of the range. The x range will be [-11:10] because the default is [-10:10] and it has been expanded to the left by 0.05 of that total range. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402963000000000000000">Origin</h2>  The <b>set origin</b> command is used to specify the origin of a plotting surface (i.e., the graph and its margins) on the screen. The coordinates are given in the <b>screen</b> coordinate system (see <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b> for information about this system). <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>

<pre>
set output {"&lt;filename&gt;"}
show output</pre>  <p> The filename must be enclosed in quotes. If the filename is omitted, any output file opened by a previous invocation of <b>set output</b> will be closed and new output will be sent to STDOUT.

<p> When both <b>set terminal</b> and <b>set output</b> are used together, it is safest to give <b>set terminal</b> first, because some terminals set a flag which is needed in some operating systems. This would be the case, for example, if the operating system needs a separate open command for binary files. </p>
<p> On platforms that support pipes, it may be useful to pipe terminal output. For instance, </p>

<h2 id="SECTION0402965000000000000000">Overflow</h2>  Syntax:  <pre>
set overflow {float | NaN | undefined}
unset overflow</pre>  <p> This version of gnuplot supports 64-bit integer arithmetic. This means that for values from 2<code>^</code>53 to 2<code>^</code>63 (roughly 10<code>^</code>16 to 10<code>^</code>19) integer evaluation preserves more precision than evaluation using IEEE 754 floating point arithmetic. However unlike the IEEE floating point representation, which sacrifices precision to span a total range of roughly [-10<code>^</code>307 : 10<code>^</code>307], integer operations that result in values outside the range [-2<code>^</code>63 : 2<code>^</code>63] overflow. The <b>set overflow</b> command lets you control what happens in case of overflow. See options below. </p>
<p> <b>set overflow</b> is the same as <b>set overflow float</b>. It causes the result to be returned as a real number rather than as an integer. This is the default. </p>
<p> The command <b>unset overflow</b> causes integer arithmetic overflow to be ignored. No error is shown. This may be desirable if your platform allows only 32-bit integer arithmetic and you want to approximate the behaviour of gnuplot versions prior to 5.4. </p>
<p> The <b>reset</b> command does not affect the state of overflow handling. </p>
<p> Earlier gnuplot versions were limited to 32-bit arithmetic and ignored integer overflow. Note, however, that some built-in operators did not use integer arithmetic at all, even when given integer arguments. This included the exponentiation operator N**M and the summation operator (see <b><a href="expressions.html#summation">summation</a></b>). These operations now return an integer value when given integer arguments, making them potentially susceptible to overflow and thus affected by the state of <b>set overflow</b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402965100000000000000">Float</h3> If an integer arithmetic expression overflows the limiting range, [-2<code>^</code>63 : 2<code>^</code>63] for 64-bit integers, the result is returned as a floating point value instead. This is not treated as an error. Example:  <pre>

<h2 id="SECTION0402966000000000000000">Palette</h2>  The palette is a set of colors, usually ordered in the form of one or more stepped gradients, used for <b>pm3d</b> surfaces and other graph elements colored by z value. Colors in the current palette are automatically mapped from plot coordinates z values or an extra data column of gray values. Palette colors also can be accessed explicitly in a color specification (see <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles.html#colorspec">colorspec</a></b>) <ul> <li>as a <b>gray value</b> also known as <b>palette fraction</b> in the range [0:1] </li> <li>as a <b>z value</b> corresponding to the z coordinate of a plot element </li> <li>as a <b>cb value</b> in the range [cbmin:cbmax] (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_cbrange">set cbrange</a></b>) </li> </ul> The current palette is shown by default in a separate <b>colorbox</b> drawn next to plots that use plot style <b>pm3d</b>.

show colornames</pre>  <p> <b>set palette</b> (i.e. without options) sets up the default values. Otherwise, the options can be given in any order. <b>show palette</b> shows the current palette properties. </p>
<p> <b>show palette gradient</b> displays the gradient defining the palette (if appropriate). <b>show palette rgbformulae</b> prints the available fixed gray –<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> color transformation formulae. <b>show colornames</b> prints the known color names. </p>
<p> <b>show palette palette <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> prints to the screen or to the file given by <b>set print</b> a table of RGB triplets calculated for the current palette settings and a palette having <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> discrete colors. The default wide table can be limited to 3 columns of r,g,b float values [0..1] or integer values [0..255] by options float or int, respectively. This way, the current gnuplot color palette can be loaded into other imaging applications, for example Octave. Alternatively, the <b>test palette</b> command will plot the R,G,B profiles for the current palette and leave the profile values in a datablock $PALETTE. </p>
<p> The following options determine the coloring properties. </p>
<p> Figure using this palette can be <b>gray</b> or <b>color</b>. For instance, in <b>pm3d</b> color surfaces the gray of each small spot is obtained by mapping the averaged z-coordinate of the 4 corners of surface quadrangles into the range [min_z,max_z] providing range of grays [0:1]. This value can be used directly as the gray for gray maps. The color map requires a transformation gray –<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> (R,G,B), i.e. a mapping [0:1] –<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> ([0:1],[0:1],[0:1]). </p>
<p> Basically two different types of mappings can be used: Analytic formulae to convert gray to color, or discrete mapping tables which are interpolated. <b>palette rgbformulae</b> and <b>palette functions</b> use analytic formulae whereas <b>palette defined</b> and <b>palette file</b> use interpolated tables. <b>palette rgbformulae</b> reduces the size of postscript output to a minimum. </p>
<p> The command <b>show palette fit2rgbformulae</b> finds the best matching <b>set palette rgbformulae</b> for the current <b>set palette</b>. Naturally, it makes sense to use it for non-rgbformulae palettes. This command can be found useful mainly for external programs using the same rgbformulae definition of palettes as gnuplot, like zimg ( <a href="http://zimg.sourceforge.net"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://zimg.sourceforge.net </span></a> </p>
<p> ). </p>
<p> <b>set palette gray</b> switches to a gray only palette. <b>set palette rgbformulae</b>, <b>set palette defined</b>, <b>set palette file</b> and <b>set palette functions</b> switch to a color mapping. <b>set palette color</b> is an easy way to switch back from the gray palette to the last color mapping. </p>
<p> Automatic gamma correction via <b>set palette gamma <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>gamma<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> can be done for gray maps (<b>set palette gray</b>) and for the <b>cubehelix</b> color palette schemes. Gamma = 1 produces a linear ramp of intensity. See <b><a href="test.html#test_palette">test palette</a></b>. </p>
<p> Many terminals support only discrete number of colors (e.g. 256 colors in gif). After the default gnuplot linetype colors are allocated, the rest of the available colors are by default reserved for pm3d. Thus a multiplot using multiple palettes could fail because the first palette has used all the available color positions. You can mitigate this limitation by using <b>set palette maxcolors <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>N<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> with a reasonably small value of N. This option causes N discrete colors to be selected from a continuous palette sampled at equally spaced intervals. If you want unequal spacing of N discrete colors, use <b>set palette defined</b> instead of a single continuous palette. </p>
<p> RGB color space might not be the most useful color space to work in. For that reason you may change the color space <b>model</b> to one of <b>RGB</b>, <b>HSV</b>, <b>CMY</b>. Using color names for <b>set palette defined</b> tables and a color space other than RGB will result in funny colors. All explanation have been written for RGB color space, so please note, that <b>R</b> can be <b>H</b>, or <b>C</b>, depending on the actual color space (<b>G</b> and <b>B</b> accordingly). </p>
<p> All values for all color spaces are limited to [0,1]. </p>
<p> RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue; CMY stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow; HSV stands for Hue, Saturation, Value. For more information on color models see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space </span></a> </p>
<p> Note: Earlier gnuplot versions accepted YIQ and XYZ color space models also, but the implementation was never complete or correct. </p>

<h3 id="SECTION0402966800000000000000">Postscript</h3> In order to reduce the size of postscript files, the gray value and not all three calculated r,g,b values are written to the file. Therefore the analytical formulae are coded directly in the postscript language as a header just before the pm3d drawing, see /g and /cF definitions. Usually, it makes sense to write therein definitions of only the 3 formulae used. But for multiplot or any other reason you may want to manually edit the transformations directly in the postscript file. This is the default option <b>nops_allcF</b>. Using the option <b>ps_allcF</b> writes postscript definitions of all formulae. This you may find interesting if you want to edit the postscript file in order to have different palettes for different surfaces in one graph. Well, you can achieve this functionality by <b>multiplot</b> with fixed <b>origin</b> and <b>size</b>. <p> If you are writing a pm3d surface to a postscript file, it may be possible to reduce the file size by up to 50% by the enclosed awk script <b>pm3dCompress.awk</b>.

The command <b>unset parametric</b> restores the plotting style to normal, single-valued expression plotting. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set parametric
unset parametric
show parametric</pre>  <p> For 2D plotting, a parametric function is determined by a pair of parametric functions operating on a parameter. An example of a 2D parametric function would be <b>plot sin(t),cos(t)</b>, which draws a circle (if the aspect ratio is set correctly — see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_size">set size</a></b>). <b>gnuplot</b> will display an error message if both functions are not provided for a parametric <b>plot</b>. </p>
<p> For 3D plotting, the surface is described as x=f(u,v), y=g(u,v), z=h(u,v). Therefore a triplet of functions is required. An example of a 3D parametric function would be <b>cos(u)*cos(v),cos(u)*sin(v),sin(u)</b>, which draws a sphere. <b>gnuplot</b> will display an error message if all three functions are not provided for a parametric <b>splot</b>. </p>
<p> The total set of possible plots is a superset of the simple f(x) style plots, since the two functions can describe the x and y values to be computed separately. In fact, plots of the type t,f(t) are equivalent to those produced with f(x) because the x values are computed using the identity function. Similarly, 3D plots of the type u,v,f(u,v) are equivalent to f(x,y). </p>
<p> Note that the order the parametric functions are specified is xfunction, yfunction (and zfunction) and that each operates over the common parametric domain. </p>
<p> Also, the <b>set parametric</b> function implies a new range of values. Whereas the normal f(x) and f(x,y) style plotting assume an xrange and yrange (and zrange), the parametric mode additionally specifies a trange, urange, and vrange. These ranges may be set directly with <b>set trange</b>, <b>set urange</b>, and <b>set vrange</b>, or by specifying the range on the <b>plot</b> or <b>splot</b> commands. Currently the default range for these parametric variables is [-5:5]. Setting the ranges to something more meaningful is expected. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402968000000000000000">Paxis</h2>  Syntax:  <pre>

set paxis &lt;axisno&gt; label &lt;label-options&gt; { offset &lt;radial-offset&gt; }
show paxis &lt;axisno&gt; {range | tics}</pre>  The <b>set paxis</b> command is equivalent to the <b>set xrange</b> and <b>set xtics</b> commands except that it acts on one of the axes p1, p2, ... used in parallel axis plots and spiderplots. See <b><a href="parallelaxes.html#parallelaxes">parallelaxes</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xrange">set xrange</a></b>, and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xtics">set xtics</a></b>. The normal options to the range and tics commands are accepted although not all options make sense for parallel axis plots. <p> <b>set paxis <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>axisno<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> label <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>label-options<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> is relevant to spiderplots but ignored otherwise. Axes of a parallel axis plot can be labeled using the <b>title</b> option of the plot command, which generates an xtic label. Note that this may require also <b>set xtics</b>. </p>
<p> The axis linetype properties are controlled using <b><a href="set_show.html#set_style_parallelaxis">set style parallelaxis</a></b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402969000000000000000">Pixmap</h2>  Syntax:  <pre>
set pixmap &lt;index&gt; "filename" at &lt;position&gt;
           {width &lt;w&gt; | height &lt;h&gt; | size &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;}
           {front|back|behind} {center}
show pixmaps
unset pixmaps
unset pixmap &lt;index&gt;</pre>  <p> The <b>set pixmap</b> command is similar to <b>set object</b> in that it defines an object that will appear on subsequent plots. The rectangular array of red/green/blue/alpha values making up the pixmap are read from a png, jpeg, or gif file. The position and extent occupied by the pixmap in the gnuplot output may be specified in any coordinate system (see <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b>). The coordinates given by <b>at <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>position<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> refer to the lower left corner of the pixmap unless keyword <b>center</b> is present. </p>
<p> If the x-extent of the rendered pixmap is set using <b>width <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>x-extent<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> the aspect ratio of the original image is retained and neither the aspect ratio nor the orientation of the pixmap changes with axis scaling or rotation. Similarly if the y-extent is set using <b>height <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>y-extent<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. If both the x-extent and y-extent are given using <b>size <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>x-extent<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>y-extent<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> this overrides the original aspect ratio. If no size is set then the original size in pixels is used (the effective size is then terminal-dependent). </p>
<p> Pixmaps are not clipped to the border of the plot. As an exception to the general behaviour of objects and layers, a pixmap assigned to layer <b>behind</b> is rendered for only the first plot in a multiplot. This allows all panels in a multiplot to share a single background pixmap. </p>
<p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
# Use a gradient as the background for all plotting
# Both x and y will be resized to fill the entire canvas
set pixmap 1 "gradient.png"

show pm3d
unset pm3d</pre>  <p> Note that pm3d plots are plotted sequentially in the order given in the splot command. Thus earlier plots may be obscured by later plots. To avoid this you can use the <b>depthorder</b> scan option. </p>
<p> The pm3d surfaces can be projected onto the <b>top</b> or <b>bottom</b> of the view box. See <b><a href="set_show.html#pm3d_position">pm3d position</a></b>. The following command draws three color surfaces at different altitudes:  </p>
<pre>
set border 4095
set pm3d at s
splot 10*x with pm3d at b, x*x-y*y, x*x+y*y with pm3d at t</pre>  <p> See also help for <b><a href="set_show.html#set_palette">set palette</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#set_cbrange">set cbrange</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#set_colorbox">set colorbox</a></b>, and the demo file <b>demo/pm3d.dem</b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402971100000000000000">Implicit</h3> A pm3d color surface is drawn if the splot command specifies <b>with pm3d</b>, if the data or function <b>style</b> is set to pm3d globally, or if the pm3d mode is <b>set pm3d implicit</b>. In the latter two cases, the pm3d surface is draw in addition to the mesh produced by the style specified in the plot command. E.g.  <pre>
splot 'fred.dat' with lines, 'lola.dat' with lines</pre>  would draw both a mesh of lines and a pm3d surface for each data set. If the option <b>explicit</b> is on (or <b>implicit</b> is off) only plots specified by the <b>with pm3d</b> attribute are plotted with a pm3d surface, e.g.:  <pre>
splot 'fred.dat' with lines, 'lola.dat' with pm3d</pre>  would plot 'fred.dat' with lines (only) and 'lola.dat' with a pm3d surface. <p> On gnuplot start-up, the mode is <b>explicit</b>. For historical and compatibility reasons, the commands <b>set pm3d;</b> (i.e. no options) and <b>set pm3d at X ...</b> (i.e. <b>at</b> is the first option) change the mode to <b>implicit</b>. The command <b>set pm3d;</b> sets other options to their default state. </p>
<p> If you set the default data or function style to <b>pm3d</b>, e.g.:  </p>
<pre>
set style data pm3d</pre>  then the options <b>implicit</b> and <b>explicit</b> have no effect. <h3 id="SECTION0402971200000000000000">Algorithm</h3>  <p> Let us first describe how a map/surface is drawn. The input data come from an evaluated function or from an <b>splot data file</b>. Each surface consists of a sequence of separate scans (isolines). The pm3d algorithm fills the region between two neighbouring points in one scan with another two points in the next scan by a gray (or color) according to z-values (or according to an additional 'color' column, see help for <b><a href="plot.html#using">using</a></b>) of these 4 corners; by default the 4 corner values are averaged, but this can be changed by the option <b>corners2color</b>. In order to get a reasonable surface, the neighbouring scans should not cross and the number of points in the neighbouring scans should not differ too much; of course, the best plot is with scans having same number of points. There are no other requirements (e.g. the data need not be gridded). Another advantage is that the pm3d algorithm does not draw anything outside of the input (measured or calculated) region. </p>
<p> Surface coloring works with the following input data: </p>
<p> 1. splot of function or of data file with one or three data columns: The gray/color scale is obtained by mapping the averaged (or <b>corners2color</b>) z-coordinate of the four corners of the above-specified quadrangle into the range [min_color_z,max_color_z] of <b>zrange</b> or <b>cbrange</b> providing a gray value in the range [0:1]. This value can be used directly as the gray for gray maps. The normalized gray value can be further mapped into a color — see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_palette">set palette</a></b> for the complete description. </p>
<p> 2. splot of data file with two or four data columns: The gray/color value is obtained by using the last-column coordinate instead of the z-value, thus allowing the color and the z-coordinate be mutually independent. This can be used for 4d data drawing. </p>
<p> Other notes: </p>
<p> 1. The term 'scan' referenced above is used more among physicists than the term 'iso_curve' referenced in gnuplot documentation and sources. You measure maps recorded one scan after another scan, that's why. </p>
<p> 2. The 'gray' or 'color' scale is a linear mapping of a continuous variable onto a smoothly varying palette of colors. The mapping is shown in a rectangle next to the main plot. This documentation refers to this as a <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>colorbox<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, and refers to the indexing variable as lying on the colorbox axis. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_colorbox">set colorbox</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#set_cbrange">set cbrange</a></b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402971300000000000000">Lighting</h3>  By default the colors assigned to pm3d objects are not dependent on orientation or viewing angle. This state corresponds to <b>set pm3d nolighting</b>. The command <b>set pm3d lighting</b> selects a simple lighting model consisting of a single fixed source of illumination contributing 50% of the overall lighting. The strength of this light relative to the ambient illumination can be adjusted by <b>set pm3d lighting primary <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>fraction<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. Inclusion of specular highlighting can be adjusted by setting a fractional contribution:  <pre>
set pm3d lighting primary 0.50 specular 0.0   # no highlights
set pm3d lighting primary 0.50 specular 0.6   # strong highlights</pre>  Solid-color pm3d surfaces tend to look very flat without specular highlights. Since the highlights from a single source only affect one side of the surface, a second spotlight source may be desirable to add specular highlights from the opposite direction. This is controlled by <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>spec2 <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>contribution<span class="MATH">&gt;</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. EXPERIMENTAL (details may change in a future version): The second spotlight is a pure red light source that by default contributes nothing (spec2 0.0). See also hidden_compare.dem <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo_5.4/hidden_compare.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">(comparison of hidden3d and pm3d treatment of solid-color surfaces) </span></a> <h3 id="SECTION0402971400000000000000">Position</h3> Color surface can be drawn at the base or top (then it is a gray/color planar map) or at z-coordinates of surface points (gray/color surface). This is defined by the <b>at</b> option with a string of up to 6 combinations of <b>b</b>, <b>t</b> and <b>s</b>. For instance, <b>at b</b> plots at bottom only, <b>at st</b> plots firstly surface and then top map, while <b>at bstbst</b> will never by seriously used. <p> Colored quadrangles are plotted one after another. When plotting surfaces (<b>at s</b>), the later quadrangles overlap (overdraw) the previous ones. (Gnuplot is not virtual reality tool to calculate intersections of filled polygon meshes.) You may try to switch between <b>scansforward</b> and <b>scansbackward</b> to force the first scan of the data to be plotted first or last. The default is <b>scansautomatic</b> where gnuplot makes a guess about scans order. On the other hand, the <b>depthorder</b> option completely reorders the quadrangles. The rendering is performed after a depth sorting, which allows to visualize even complicated surfaces; see <b><a href="set_show.html#pm3d_depthorder">pm3d depthorder</a></b> for more details. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402971500000000000000">Scanorder</h3>        <pre>
set pm3d {scansautomatic | scansforward | scansbackward | depthorder}</pre>  <p> By default the quadrangles making up a pm3d solid surface are rendered in the order they are encountered along the surface grid points. This order may be controlled by the options <b>scansautomatic</b><span class="MATH">|</span><b>scansforward</b><span class="MATH">|</span><b>scansbackward</b>. These scan options are not in general compatible with hidden-surface removal. </p>
<p> If two successive scans do not have same number of points, then it has to be decided whether to start taking points for quadrangles from the beginning of both scans (<b>flush begin</b>), from their ends (<b>flush end</b>) or to center them (<b>flush center</b>). Note, that <b>flush (center<span class="MATH">|</span>end)</b> are incompatible with <b>scansautomatic</b>: if you specify <b>flush center</b> or <b>flush end</b> and <b>scansautomatic</b> is set, it is silently switched to <b>scansforward</b>. </p>
<p> If two subsequent scans do not have the same number of points, the option <b>ftriangles</b> specifies whether color triangles are drawn at the scan tail(s) where there are not enough points in either of the scans. This can be used to draw a smooth map boundary. </p>
<p> Gnuplot does not do true hidden surface removal for solid surfaces, but often it is sufficient to render the component quadrangles in order from furthest to closest. This mode may be selected using the option  </p>
<pre>
set pm3d depthorder</pre>  Note that the global option <b>set hidden3d</b> does not affect pm3d surfaces. <p> The <b>depthorder</b> option by itself tends to produce bad results when applied to the long thin rectangles generated by <b>splot with boxes</b>. It works better to add the keyword <b>base</b>, which performs the depth sort using the intersection of the box with the plane at z=0. This type of plot is further improved by adding a lighing model. Example:  </p>
<pre>
set pm3d depthorder base

set boxdepth 0.4
splot $DATA using 1:2:3 with boxes</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION0402971600000000000000">Clipping</h3>     Syntax:  <pre>
set pm3d {clip {z} | clip1in | clip4in}
set pm3d {no}clipcb</pre>  <p> The component quadrangles of a pm3d surface or other 3D object are by default smoothly clipped against the current zrange. This is a change from earlier gnuplot versions. </p>
<p> Alternatively, surfaces can be clipped by rendering whole quadrangles but only those with all 4 corners in-range on x, y, and z (<b>set pm3d clip4in</b>), or only those with at least one corner in-range on x, y, and z (<b>set pm3d clip1in</b>). The options <b>clip</b>, <b>clip1in</b>, and <b>clip4in</b> are mutually exclusive. </p>
<p> Separate from clipping based on spatial x, y, and z coordinates, quadrangles can be rendered or not based on extreme palette color values. <b>clipcb</b>: (default) palette color values <span class="MATH">&lt;</span> cbmin are clipped to equal cbmin; palette color values <span class="MATH">&gt;</span> cbmax are clipped to equal cbmax. <b>noclipcb</b>: quadrangles with color value outside cbrange are not drawn at all. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402971700000000000000">Color_assignment</h3> The default pm3d coloring assigns an individual color to each quadrangle of the surface grid. For alternative coloring schemes that assign uniform color to the entire surface, see <b><a href="set_show.html#pm3d_fillcolor">pm3d fillcolor</a></b>. <p> A single gray/color value (i.e. not a gradient) is assigned to each quadrangle. This value is calculated from the z-coordinates the four quadrangle corners according to <b>corners2color <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>option<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. The value is then used to select a color from the current palette. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_palette">set palette</a></b>. It is not possible to change palettes inside a single <b>splot</b> command. </p>
<p> If a fourth column of data is provided, the coloring of individual quadrangles works as above except that the color value is distinct from the z value. As a separate coloring option, the fourth data column may provide instead an RGB color. See <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles.html#rgbcolor_variable">rgbcolor variable</a></b>. In this case the plotting command must be </p>
<pre>
splot ... using 1:2:3:4 with pm3d lc rgb variable</pre>  <p> Notice that ranges of z-values and color-values for surfaces are adjustable independently by <b>set zrange</b>, <b>set cbrange</b>, <b>set log z</b>, <b>set log cb</b>, etc. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402971800000000000000">Corners2color</h3>         The color of each quadrangle in a pm3d surface is assigned based on the color values of its four bounding vertices. The options 'mean' (default), 'geomean', 'harmean, 'rms', and 'median' produce various kinds of surface color smoothing, while options 'min' and 'max' choose minimal or maximal value, respectively. This may not be desired for pixel images or for maps with sharp and intense peaks, in which case the options 'c1', 'c2', 'c3' or 'c4' can be used instead to assign the quadrangle color based on the z-coordinate of only one corner. Some experimentation may be needed to determine which corner corresponds to 'c1', as the orientation depends on the drawing direction. Because the pm3d algorithm does not extend the colored surface outside the range of the input data points, the 'c<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>j<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>' coloring options will result in pixels along two edges of the grid not contributing to the color of any quadrangle. For example, applying the pm3d algorithm to the 4x4 grid of data points in script <b>demo/pm3d.dem</b> (please have a look) produces only (4-1)x(4-1)=9 colored rectangles. <h3 id="SECTION0402971900000000000000">Border</h3> The option <b>set pm3d border {line-properties}</b> draws bounding lines around each quadrangle as it is rendered. Normally this is used in conjunction with the <b>depthorder</b> option to approximate hidden line removal. Note that the global option <b>set hidden3d</b> has no effect on pm3d plots. Default line properties (color, width) optionally follow the keyword <b>border</b>. These defaults can be overridden later in an splot command. <p> Example of recommended usage: </p>
<pre>
set pm3d at s depthorder border lw 0.2 lt black
unset hidden3d
unset surf
splot x*x+y*y linecolor rgb "blue"   # otherwise it would be black</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION04029711000000000000000">Fillcolor</h3>   <pre>
splot FOO with pm3d fillcolor &lt;colorspec&gt;</pre>  <p> Plot style <b>with pm3d</b> accepts an optional fillcolor in the splot command. This specification is applied to the entire pm3d surface. See <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles.html#colorspec">colorspec</a></b>. Most fillcolor specifications will result in a single solid color, which is hard to interpret visually unless there is also a lighting model present to distinguish surface components based on orientation. See <b><a href="set_show.html#pm3d_lighting">pm3d lighting</a></b>. </p>
<p> There are a few special cases. <b>with pm3d fillcolor palette</b> would produce the same result as the default pm3d palette-based coloring, and is therefore not a useful option. <b>with pm3d fillcolor linestyle N</b> is more interesting. This variant assigns distinct colors to the top and bottom of the pm3d surface, similar to the color scheme used by gnuplot's <b>hidden3d</b> mode. Linestyle N is used for the top surface; linestyle N+1 for the bottom surface. Note that <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>top<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>bottom<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> depend on the scan order, so that the colors are inverted for <b>pm3d scansbackward</b> as compared to <b>pm3d scansforward</b>. This coloring option works best with <b>pm3d depthorder</b>, however, which unfortunately does not allow you to control the scan order so you may have to instead swap the colors defined for linestyles N and N+1. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION04029711100000000000000">Interpolate</h3> The option <b>interpolate m,n</b> will interpolate between grid points to generate a finer mesh. For data files, this smooths the color surface and enhances the contrast of spikes in the surface. When working with functions, interpolation makes little sense. It would usually make more sense to increase <b>samples</b> and <b>isosamples</b>. <p> For positive m and n, each quadrangle or triangle is interpolated m-times and n-times in the respective direction. For negative m and n, the interpolation frequency is chosen so that there will be at least <span class="MATH">|</span>m<span class="MATH">|</span> and <span class="MATH">|</span>n<span class="MATH">|</span> points drawn; you can consider this as a special gridding function. </p>
<p> Note: <b>interpolate 0,0</b>, will automatically choose an optimal number of interpolated surface points. </p>
<p> Note: Currently color interpolation is always linear, even if corners2color is set to a nonlinear scheme such as the geometric mean. </p>

<h2 id="SECTION0402972000000000000000">Pointintervalbox</h2>  The <b>pointinterval</b> and <b>pointnumber</b> properties of a line type are used only in plot style <b>linespoints</b>. A negative value of pointinterval or pointnumber, e.g. -N, means that before the selected set of point symbols are drawn a box (actually circle) behind each point symbol is blanked out by filling with the background color. The command <b>set pointintervalbox</b> controls the radius of this blanked-out region. It is a multiplier for the default radius, which is equal to the point size. <h2 id="SECTION0402973000000000000000">Pointsize</h2>  The <b>set pointsize</b> command scales the size of the points used in plots. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set pointsize &lt;multiplier&gt;
show pointsize</pre>  <p> The default is a multiplier of 1.0. Larger pointsizes may be useful to make points more visible in bitmapped graphics. </p>
<p> The pointsize of a single plot may be changed on the <b>plot</b> command. See <b><a href="plot.html#plot_with">plot with</a></b> for details. </p>
<p> Please note that the pointsize setting is not supported by all terminal types. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402974000000000000000">Polar</h2>   The <b>set polar</b> command changes the meaning of the plot from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set polar
unset polar
show polar</pre>  <p> In polar coordinates, the dummy variable (t) represents an angle theta. The default range of t is [0:2*pi], or [0:360] if degree units have been selected (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_angles">set angles</a></b>). </p>
<p> The command <b>unset polar</b> changes the meaning of the plot back to the default rectangular coordinate system. </p>
<p> The <b>set polar</b> command is not supported for <b>splot</b>s. See the <b><a href="set_show.html#set_mapping">set mapping</a></b> command for similar functionality for <b><a href="splot.html#splot">splot</a></b>s. </p>
<p> While in polar coordinates the meaning of an expression in t is really r = f(t), where t is an angle of rotation. The trange controls the domain (the angle) of the function. The r, x and y ranges control the extent of the graph in the x and y directions. Each of these ranges, as well as the rrange, may be autoscaled or set explicitly. For details, see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_rrange">set rrange</a></b> and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xrange">set xrange</a></b>. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set polar
plot t*sin(t)
set trange [-2*pi:2*pi]
set rrange [0:3]
plot t*sin(t)</pre>  <p> The first <b>plot</b> uses the default polar angular domain of 0 to 2*pi. The radius and the size of the graph are scaled automatically. The second <b>plot</b> expands the domain, and restricts the size of the graph to the area within 3 units of the origin. This has the effect of limiting x and y to [-3:3]. </p>
<p> By default polar plots are oriented such that theta=0 is at the far right, with theta increasing counterclockwise. You can change both the origin and the sense explicitly. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_theta">set theta</a></b>. </p>
<p> You may want to <b>set size square</b> to have <b>gnuplot</b> try to make the aspect ratio equal to unity, so that circles look circular. Tic marks around the perimeter can be specified using <b>set ttics</b>.

<p> The destination for <b>print</b> commands can also be a named data block. Data block names start with '$', see also <b><a href="inline_data_datablocks.html#inline_data">inline data</a></b>. When printing a string to a data block, embedded newline characters are expanded to generate multiple data block entries. This is a CHANGE. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402976000000000000000">Psdir</h2>  The <b>set psdir <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>directory<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> command controls the search path used by the postscript terminal to find prologue.ps and character encoding files. You can use this mechanism to switch between different sets of locally-customized prolog files. The search order is  <pre>
1) The directory specified by `set psdir`, if any
2) The directory specified by environmental variable GNUPLOT_PS_DIR
3) A built-in header or one from the default system directory
4) Directories set by `set loadpath`</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION0402977000000000000000">Raxis</h2>  The commands <b>set raxis</b> and <b>unset raxis</b> toggle whether the polar axis is drawn separately from grid lines and the x axis. If the minimum of the current rrange is non-zero (and not autoscaled), then a white circle is drawn at the center of the polar plot to indicate that the plot lines and axes do not reach 0. The axis line is drawn using the same line type as the plot border. See <b><a href="set_show.html#polar">polar</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#rrange">rrange</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#rtics">rtics</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#rlabel">rlabel</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#set_grid">set grid</a></b>. <h2 id="SECTION0402978000000000000000">Rgbmax</h2>   Syntax:  <pre>
set rgbmax {1.0 | 255}
unset rgbmax</pre>  The red/green/blue color components of an rgbimage plot are by default interpreted as integers in the range [0:255]. <b>set rgbmax 1.0</b> tells the program that data values used to generate the color components of a plot with <b>rgbimage</b> or <b>rgbalpha</b> are floating point values in the range [0:1]. <b>unset rgbmax</b> returns to the default integer range [0:255]. <h2 id="SECTION0402979000000000000000">Rlabel</h2>  This command places a label above the r axis. The label will be drawn whether or not the plot is in polar mode. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xlabel">set xlabel</a></b> for additional keywords. <h2 id="SECTION0402980000000000000000">Rmargin</h2>  The command <b>set rmargin</b> sets the size of the right margin. Please see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_margin">set margin</a></b> for details. <h2 id="SECTION0402981000000000000000">Rrange</h2>  The <b>set rrange</b> command sets the range of the radial coordinate for a graph in polar mode. This has the effect of setting both xrange and yrange as well. The resulting xrange and yrange are both [-(rmax-rmin) : +(rmax-rmin)]. However if you later change the x or y range, for example by zooming, this does not change rrange, so data points continue to be clipped against rrange. Unlike other axes, autoscaling the raxis always results in rmin = 0. The <b>reverse</b> autoscaling flag is ignored. Note: Setting a negative value for rmin may produce unexpected results. <h2 id="SECTION0402982000000000000000">Rtics</h2>  The <b>set rtics</b> command places tics along the polar axis. The tics and labels are drawn to the right of the origin. The <b>mirror</b> keyword causes them to be drawn also to the left of the origin. See <b><a href="set_show.html#polar">polar</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xtics">set xtics</a></b>, and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_mxtics">set mxtics</a></b> for discussion of keywords. <h2 id="SECTION0402983000000000000000">Samples</h2>  The default sampling rate of functions, or for interpolating data, may be changed by the <b>set samples</b> command. To change the sampling range for a particular plot, see <b><a href="plot.html#plot_sampling">plot sampling</a></b>. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set samples &lt;samples_1&gt; {,&lt;samples_2&gt;}
show samples</pre>  <p> By default, sampling is set to 100 points. A higher sampling rate will produce more accurate plots, but will take longer. This parameter has no effect on data file plotting unless one of the interpolation/approximation options is used. See <b><a href="plot.html#plot_smooth">plot smooth</a></b> re 2D data and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_cntrparam">set cntrparam</a></b> and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_dgrid3d">set dgrid3d</a></b> re 3D data. </p>
<p> When a 2D graph is being done, only the value of <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>samples_1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is relevant. </p>
<p> When a surface plot is being done without the removal of hidden lines, the value of samples specifies the number of samples that are to be evaluated for the isolines. Each iso-v line will have <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>sample_1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> samples and each iso-u line will have <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>sample_2<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> samples. If you only specify <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>samples_1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>samples_2<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> will be set to the same value as <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>samples_1<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. See also <b><a href="set_show.html#set_isosamples">set isosamples</a></b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION0402984000000000000000">Size</h2>    Syntax:  <pre>
set size {{no}square | ratio &lt;r&gt; | noratio} {&lt;xscale&gt;,&lt;yscale&gt;}
show size</pre>  <p> The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>xscale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>yscale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> values are scale factors for the size of the plot, which includes the graph, labels, and margins. </p>
<p> Important note:  </p>
<pre>
In earlier versions of gnuplot, some terminal types used the values from
`set size` to control also the size of the output canvas; others did not.
Almost all terminals now follow the following convention:</pre>  <p> <b>set term <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>terminal_type<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> size <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>XX<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>YY<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> controls the size of the output file, or <b>canvas</b>. Please see individual terminal documentation for allowed values of the size parameters. By default, the plot will fill this canvas. </p>
<p> <b>set size <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>XX<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>YY<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> scales the plot itself relative to the size of the canvas. Scale values less than 1 will cause the plot to not fill the entire canvas. Scale values larger than 1 will cause only a portion of the plot to fit on the canvas. Please be aware that setting scale values larger than 1 may cause problems on some terminal types. </p>
<p> <b>ratio</b> causes <b>gnuplot</b> to try to create a graph with an aspect ratio of <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>r<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> (the ratio of the y-axis length to the x-axis length) within the portion of the plot specified by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>xscale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>yscale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. </p>
<p> The meaning of a negative value for <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>r<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is different. If <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>r<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>=-1, gnuplot tries to set the scales so that the unit has the same length on both the x and y axes. This is the 2D equivalent to the 3D command <b>set view equal xy</b>. If <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>r<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>=-2, the unit on y has twice the length of the unit on x, and so on. </p>
<p> The success of <b>gnuplot</b> in producing the requested aspect ratio depends on the terminal selected. The graph area will be the largest rectangle of aspect ratio <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>r<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> that will fit into the specified portion of the output (leaving adequate margins, of course).  </p>
<p> <b>set size square</b> is a synonym for <b>set size ratio 1</b>. </p>
<p> Both <b>noratio</b> and <b>nosquare</b> return the graph to the default aspect ratio of the terminal, but do not return <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>xscale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> or <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>yscale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> to their default values (1.0). </p>
<p> <b>ratio</b> and <b>square</b> have no effect on 3D plots, but do affect 3D projections created using <b>set view map</b>. See also <b><a href="set_show.html#set_view_equal">set view equal</a></b>, which forces the x and y axes of a 3D onto the same scale. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> To set the size so that the plot fills the available canvas:  </p>
<pre>
set size 1,1</pre>  <p> To make the graph half size and square use:  </p>
<pre>
set size square 0.5,0.5</pre>  <p> To make the graph twice as high as wide use:  </p>
<pre>
set size ratio 2</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION0402985000000000000000">Spiderplot</h2> The <b>set spiderplot</b> command switches interpretation of coordinates to a polar system in which each data point is mapped to a position along a radial axis. paxis 1 is always vertical; axes 2 to N proceed clockwise with even spacing. The command must be issued prior to plotting. It has additional effects equivalent to  <pre>

<p> If the linestyle <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>index<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> already exists, only the given parameters are changed while all others are preserved. If not, all undefined values are set to the default values. </p>
<p> Specifying <b>nohead</b> produces arrows drawn without a head — a line segment. This gives you yet another way to draw a line segment on the plot. By default, arrows have one head. Specifying <b>heads</b> draws arrow heads on both ends of the line. </p>
<p> Head size can be modified using <b>size <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>length<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>,<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>angle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> or <b>size <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>length<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>,<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>angle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>,<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>backangle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>, where <b><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>length<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> defines length of each branch of the arrow head and <b><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>angle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> the angle (in degrees) they make with the arrow. <b><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>Length<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> is in x-axis units; this can be changed by <b>first</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>graph</b>, <b>screen</b>, or <b>character</b> before the <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>length<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>; see <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b> for details. </p>
<p> By default the size of the arrow head is reduced for very short arrows. This can be disabled using the <b>fixed</b> keyword after the <b>size</b> command. </p>
<p> <b><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>backangle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> is the angle (in degrees) the back branches make with the arrow (in the same direction as <b><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>angle<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>). It is ignored if the style is <b>nofilled</b>. </p>
<p> Specifying <b>filled</b> produces filled arrow heads with a border line around the arrow head. Specifying <b>noborder</b> produces filled arrow heads with no border. In this case the tip of the arrow head lies exactly on the endpoint of the vector and the arrow head is slightly smaller overall. Dashed arrows should always use <b>noborder</b>, since a dashed border is ugly. Not all terminals support filled arrow heads. </p>
<p> The line style may be selected from a user-defined list of line styles (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_style_line">set style line</a></b>) or may be defined here by providing values for <b><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>line_type<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> (an index from the default list of styles) and/or <b><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>line_width<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> (which is a multiplier for the default width). </p>
<p> Note, however, that if a user-defined line style has been selected, its properties (type and width) cannot be altered merely by issuing another <b>set style arrow</b> command with the appropriate index and <b>lt</b> or <b>lw</b>. </p>
<p> If <b>front</b> is given, the arrows are written on top of the graphed data. If <b>back</b> is given (the default), the arrow is written underneath the graphed data. Using <b>front</b> will prevent a arrow from being obscured by dense data. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> To draw an arrow without an arrow head and double width, use:  </p>
<pre>
set style arrow 1 nohead lw 2
set arrow arrowstyle 1</pre>  <p> See also <b><a href="set_show.html#set_arrow">set arrow</a></b> for further examples. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION0402986200000000000000">Boxplot</h3> The <b>set style boxplot</b> command allows you to change the layout of plots created using the <b>boxplot</b> plot style. <p> Syntax:  </p>

                  {sorted | unsorted}</pre>  <p> The box in the boxplot always spans the range of values from the first quartile to the third quartile of the data points. The limit of the whiskers that extend from the box can be controlled in two different ways. By default the whiskers extend from each end of the box for a range equal to 1.5 times the interquartile range (i.e. the vertical height of the box proper). Each whisker is truncated back toward the median so that it terminates at a y value belonging to some point in the data set. Since there may be no point whose value is exactly 1.5 times the interquartile distance, the whisker may be shorter than its nominal range. This default corresponds to  </p>
<pre>
set style boxplot range 1.5</pre>  <p> Alternatively, you can specify the fraction of the total number of points that the whiskers should span. In this case the range is extended symmetrically from the median value until it encompasses the requested fraction of the data set. Here again each whisker is constrained to end at a point in the data set. To span 95% of the points in the set  </p>
<pre>
set style boxplot fraction 0.95</pre>  <p> Any points that lie outside the range of the whiskers are considered outliers. By default these are drawn as individual circles (pointtype 7). The option <b>nooutliers</b> disables this. If outliers are not drawn they do not contribute to autoscaling. </p>
<p> By default boxplots are drawn in a style similar to candlesticks, but you have the option of using instead a style similar to finance bars. </p>
<p> A crossbar indicating the median is drawn using the same line type as box boundary. If you want a thicker line for the median  </p>
<pre>
set style boxplot medianlinewidth 2.0</pre>  If you want no median line, set this to 0. <p> If the using specification for a boxplot contains a fourth column, the values in that column will be interpreted as the discrete leveles of a factor variable. In this case more than one boxplots may be drawn, as many as the number of levels of the factor variable. These boxplots will be drawn next to each other, the distance between them is 1.0 by default (in x-axis units). This distance can be changed by the option <b>separation</b>. </p>
<p> The <b>labels</b> option governs how and where these boxplots (each representing a part of the dataset) are labeled. By default the value of the factor is put as a tick label on the horizontal axis – x or x2, depending on which one is used for the plot itself. This setting corresponds to option <b>labels auto</b>. The labels can be forced to use either of the x or x2 axes – options <b>labels x</b> and <b>labels x2</b>, respectively –, or they can be turned off altogether with the option <b>labels off</b>. </p>
<p> By default the boxplots corresponding to different levels of the factor variable are not sorted; they will be drawn in the same order the levels are encountered in the data file. This behavior corresponds to the <b>unsorted</b> option. If the <b>sorted</b> option is active, the levels are first sorted alphabetically, and the boxplots are drawn in the sorted order. </p>
<p> The <b>separation</b>, <b>labels</b>, <b>sorted</b> and <b>unsorted</b> option only have an effect if a fourth column is given the plot specification. </p>

The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>density<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> parameter specifies the intensity of the fill color. At a <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>density<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> of 0.0, the box is empty, at <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>density<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> of 1.0, the inner area is of the same color as the current linetype. Some terminal types can vary the density continuously; others implement only a few levels of partial fill. If no <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>density<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> parameter is given, it defaults to 1. </p>
<p> The <b>pattern</b> option causes filling to be done with a fill pattern supplied by the terminal driver. The kind and number of available fill patterns depend on the terminal driver. If multiple datasets using filled boxes are plotted, the pattern cycles through all available pattern types, starting from pattern <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>n<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, much as the line type cycles for multiple line plots. </p>
<p>   Fill color (<b>fillcolor <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>colorspec<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>) is distinct from fill style. I.e. plot elements or objects can share a fillstyle while retaining separate colors. In most places where a fillstyle is accepted you can also specify a fill color. Fillcolor may be abbreviated <b>fc</b>. Otherwise the fill color is take from the current linetype. Example: </p>
<pre>
plot FOO with boxes fillstyle solid 1.0 fillcolor "cyan"</pre>  <h4 id="SECTION0402986410000000000000">Set style fill border</h4>  The bare keyword <b>border</b> causes the filled object to be surrounded by a solid line of the current linetype and color. You can change the color of this line by adding either a linetype or a linecolor. <b>noborder</b> specifies that no bounding line is drawn. Examples:  <pre>
# Half-intensity fill, full intensity border in same color
set style fill solid 0.5 border
# Half-transparent fill, solid black border (linetype -1)
set style fill transparent solid 0.5 border -1
# Pattern fill in current color, border using color of linetype 5
plot ... with boxes fillstyle pattern 2 border lt 5
# Fill area in cyan, border in blue
plot ... with boxes fillcolor "cyan" fs solid border linecolor "blue"</pre>  <p> Note: The border property of a fill style only affects plots drawn <b>with filledcurves</b> in the default mode (closed curve). </p>
<h4 id="SECTION0402986420000000000000">Set style fill transparent</h4>  Some terminals support the attribute <b>transparent</b> for filled areas. In the case of transparent solid fill areas, the <b>density</b> parameter is interpreted as an alpha value; that is, density 0 is fully transparent, density 1 is fully opaque. In the case of transparent pattern fill, the background of the pattern is either fully transparent or fully opaque. <p> Note that there may be additional limitations on the creation or viewing of graphs containing transparent fill areas. For example, the png terminal can only use transparent fill if the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>truecolor<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> option is set. Some pdf viewers may not correctly display the fill areas even if they are correctly described in the pdf file. Ghostscript/gv does not correctly display pattern-fill areas even though actual PostScript printers generally have no problem. </p>

<p> Line styles created by this mechanism do not replace the default linetype styles; both may be used. Line styles are temporary. They are lost whenever you execute a <b>reset</b> command. To redefine the linetype itself, please see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_linetype">set linetype</a></b>. </p>
<p> The line and point types default to the index value. The exact symbol that is drawn for that index value may vary from one terminal type to another. </p>
<p> The line width and point size are multipliers for the current terminal's default width and size (but note that <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>point_size<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> here is unaffected by the multiplier given by the command<b>set pointsize</b>). </p>
<p> The <b>pointinterval</b> controls the spacing between points in a plot drawn with style <b>linespoints</b>. The default is 0 (every point is drawn). For example, <b>set style line N pi 3</b> defines a linestyle that uses pointtype N, pointsize and linewidth equal to the current defaults for the terminal, and will draw every 3rd point in plots using <b>with linespoints</b>. A negative value for the interval is treated the same as a positive value, except that some terminals will try to interrupt the line where it passes through the point symbol. </p>
<p> The <b>pointnumber</b> property is similar to <b>pointinterval</b> except that rather than plotting every Nth point it limits the total number of points to N. </p>
<p> Not all terminals support the <b>linewidth</b> and <b>pointsize</b> features; if not supported, the option will be ignored. </p>
<p> Terminal-independent colors may be assigned using either <b>linecolor <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>colorspec<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> or <b>linetype <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>colorspec<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>, abbreviated <b>lc</b> or <b>lt</b>.

In this mode the ratio of the ellipse axes depends on the scales of the plot axes and aspect ratio of the plot. When set to <b>xx</b> or <b>yy</b>, both axes of all ellipses will be interpreted in the same units. This means that the ratio of the axes of the plotted ellipses will be correct even after rotation, but either their vertical or horizontal extent will not be correct. </p>
<p> This is a global setting that affects all ellipses, both those defined as objects and those generated with the <b>plot</b> command, however, the value of <b>units</b> can also be redefined on a per-plot and per-object basis. </p>
<p> It is also possible to set a default size for ellipses with the <b>size</b> keyword. This default size applies to data plots with only 2 columns of data (x,y) and to function plots.

<pre>
set surface {implicit|explicit}
unset surface
show surface</pre>  <p> <b>unset surface</b> will cause <b>splot</b> to not draw points or lines corresponding to any of the function or data file points. This is mainly useful for drawing only contour lines rather than the surface they were derived from. Contours may still be drawn on the surface, depending on the <b>set contour</b> option. To turn off the surface for an individual function or data file while leaving others active, use the <b>nosurface</b> keyword in the <b>splot</b> command. The combination <b>unset surface; set contour base</b> is useful for displaying contours on the grid base. See also <b><a href="set_show.html#set_contour">set contour</a></b>. </p>
<p> If a 3D data set is recognizable as a mesh (grid) then by default the program implicitly treats the plot style <b>with lines</b> as requesting a gridded surface. See <b><a href="splot.html#grid_data">grid_data</a></b>. The command <b>set surface explicit</b> suppresses this expansion, plotting only the individual lines described by separate blocks of data in the input file.

Use <b>set terminal</b> to tell <b>gnuplot</b> what kind of output to generate. Use <b>set output</b> to redirect that output to a file or device. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set terminal {&lt;terminal-type&gt; | push | pop}

This helps in printing, for instance, when switching among different terminals — previous options don't have to be repeated. </p>
<p> The command <b>set term push</b> remembers the current terminal including its settings while <b>set term pop</b> restores it. This is equivalent to <b>save term</b> and <b>load term</b>, but without accessing the filesystem. Therefore they can be used to achieve platform independent restoring of the terminal after printing, for instance.

<pre>
set xtics rotate by -90

<p> Set tics <b>back</b> or <b>front</b> applies to all axes at once, but only for 2D plots (not splot). It controls whether the tics are placed behind or in front of the plot elements, in the case that there is overlap. </p>
<p> <b>axis</b> or <b>border</b> tells <b>gnuplot</b> to put the tics (both the tics themselves and the accompanying labels) along the axis or the border, respectively. If the axis is very close to the border, the <b>axis</b> option will move the tic labels to outside the border in case the border is printed (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_border">set border</a></b>). The relevant margin settings will usually be sized badly by the automatic layout algorithm in this case. </p>
<p> <b>mirror</b> tells <b>gnuplot</b> to put unlabeled tics at the same positions on the opposite border. <b>nomirror</b> does what you think it does. </p>
<p> <b>in</b> and <b>out</b> change the tic marks to be drawn inwards or outwards. </p>
<p> <b>set tics scale</b> controls the size of the tic marks. The first value <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>major<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> controls the auto-generated or user-specified major tics (level 0). The second value controls the auto-generated or user-specified minor tics (level 1). <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>major<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> defaults to 1.0, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>minor<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> defaults to <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>major<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>/2. Additional values control the size of user-specified tics with level 2, 3, ... Default tic sizes are restored by <b>set tics scale default</b>. </p>
<p> <b>rotate</b> asks <b>gnuplot</b> to rotate the text through 90 degrees, which will be done if the terminal driver in use supports text rotation. <b>norotate</b> cancels this. <b>rotate by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ang<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> asks for rotation by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ang<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> degrees, supported by some terminal types. </p>
<p> The defaults are <b>border mirror norotate</b> for tics on the x and y axes, and <b>border nomirror norotate</b> for tics on the x2 and y2 axes. For the z axis, the default is <b>nomirror</b>. </p>
<p> The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>offset<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is specified by either x,y or x,y,z, and may be preceded by <b>first</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>graph</b>, <b>screen</b>, or <b>character</b> to select the coordinate system. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>offset<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is the offset of the tics texts from their default positions, while the default coordinate system is <b>character</b>. See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b> for details. <b>nooffset</b> switches off the offset. </p>
<p> By default, tic labels are justified automatically depending on the axis and rotation angle to produce aesthetically pleasing results.

Backslash-octals ( <span class="MATH">\</span>nnn) are converted to char. If there is no separating character between the time/date elements, then %d, %m, %y, %H, %M and %S read two digits each. If a decimal point immediately follows the field read by %S, the decimal and any following digits are interpreted as a fractional second. %Y reads four digits. %j reads three digits. %b requires three characters, and %B requires as many as it needs. </p>
<p> Spaces are treated slightly differently. A space in the string stands for zero or more whitespace characters in the file. That is, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%H %M<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> can be used to read <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>1220<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>12 20<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> as well as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>12 20<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> Each set of non-blank characters in the timedata counts as one column in the <b>using n:n</b> specification. Thus <b>11:11 25/12/76 21.0</b> consists of three columns. To avoid confusion, <b>gnuplot</b> requires that you provide a complete <b>using</b> specification if your file contains timedata. </p>
<p> If the date format includes the day or month in words, the format string must exclude this text. But it can still be printed with the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%a<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%A<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%b<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%B<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> specifier. <b>gnuplot</b> will determine the proper month and weekday from the numerical values. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_format">set format</a></b> for more details about these and other options for printing time data. </p>
<p> When reading two-digit years with %y, values 69-99 refer to the 20th century, while values 00-68 refer to the 21st century. NB: This is in accordance with the UNIX98 spec, but conventions vary widely and two-digit year values are inherently ambiguous. </p>
<p> If the %p format returns <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>am<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>AM<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, hour 12 will be interpreted as hour 0.

show title</pre>  <p> If <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>offset<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is specified by either x,y or x,y,z the title is moved by the given offset. It may be preceded by <b>first</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>graph</b>, <b>screen</b>, or <b>character</b> to select the coordinate system. See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b> for details. By default, the <b>character</b> coordinate system is used. For example, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><b>set title offset 0,-1</b><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> will change only the y offset of the title, moving the title down by roughly the height of one character. The size of a character depends on both the font and the terminal. </p>
<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>font<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is used to specify the font with which the title is to be written; the units of the font <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>size<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> depend upon which terminal is used. </p>
<p> <b>textcolor <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>colorspec<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> changes the color of the text. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>colorspec<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> can be a linetype, an rgb color, or a palette mapping.

This is the border if <b>set border polar</b> is enabled, otherwise the outermost circle of the polar grid drawn at the rightmost ticmark along the r axis. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_grid">set grid</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#set_rtics">set rtics</a></b>. The angular position is always labeled in degrees.

<h2 id="SECTION04029105000000000000000">View</h2>  The <b>set view</b> command sets the viewing angle for <b>splot</b>s. It controls how the 3D coordinates of the plot are mapped into the 2D screen space. It provides controls for both rotation and scaling of the plotted data, but supports orthographic projections only. It supports both 3D projection or orthogonal 2D projection into a 2D plot-like map. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set view &lt;rot_x&gt;{,{&lt;rot_z&gt;}{,{&lt;scale&gt;}{,&lt;scale_z&gt;}}}
set view map {scale &lt;scale&gt;}
set view projection {xy|xz|yz}
set view {no}equal {xy|xyz}

show view</pre>  <p> where <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>rot_x<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>rot_z<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> control the rotation angles (in degrees) in a virtual 3D coordinate system aligned with the screen such that initially (that is, before the rotations are performed) the screen horizontal axis is x, screen vertical axis is y, and the axis perpendicular to the screen is z. The first rotation applied is <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>rot_x<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> around the x axis. The second rotation applied is <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>rot_z<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> around the new z axis. </p>
<p> Command <b>set view map</b> is used to represent the drawing as a map. It is useful for <b>contour</b> plots or 2D heatmaps using pm3d mode rather than <b>with image</b>. In the latter case, take care that you properly use <b>zrange</b> and <b>cbrange</b> for input data point filtering and color range scaling, respectively. </p>
<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>rot_x<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is bounded to the [0:180] range with a default of 60 degrees, while <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>rot_z<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is bounded to the [0:360] range with a default of 30 degrees. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>scale<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> controls the scaling of the entire <b>splot</b>, while <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>scale_z<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> scales the z axis only. Both scales default to 1.0. </p>
<p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
set view 60, 30, 1, 1
set view ,,0.5</pre>  <p> The first sets all the four default values. The second changes only scale, to 0.5. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION04029105100000000000000">Azimuth</h3>   <pre>
set view azimuth &lt;angle-in-degrees&gt;</pre>  The setting of azimuth affects the orientation of the z axis in a 3D graph (splot). At the default azimuth = 0 the z axis of the plot lies in the plane orthogonal to the screen horizontal. I.e. the projection of the z axis lies along the screen vertical. Non-zero azimuth rotates the plot about the line of sight through the origin so that a projection of the z axis is no longer vertical. When azimuth = 90 the z axis is horizontal rather than vertical. <h3 id="SECTION04029105200000000000000">Equal_axes</h3>  The command <b>set view equal xy</b> forces the unit length of the x and y axes to be on the same scale, and chooses that scale so that the plot will fit on the page. The command <b>set view equal xyz</b> additionally sets the z axis scale to match the x and y axes; however there is no guarantee that the current z axis range will fit within the plot boundary. By default all three axes are scaled independently to fill the available area. <p> See also <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xyplane">set xyplane</a></b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION04029105300000000000000">Projection</h3>  Syntax:  <pre>
set view projection {xy|xz|yz}</pre>  Rotates the view angles of a 3D plot so that one of the primary planes xy, xz, or yz lies in the plane of the plot. Axis labels and tics positioning is adjusted accordingly; tics and labels on the third axis are disabled. The plot is scaled up to approximately match the size that 'plot' would generate for the same axis ranges. <b>set view projection xy</b> is equivalent to <b>set view map</b>. <h2 id="SECTION04029106000000000000000">Vrange</h2>  Syntax: set vrange [vmin:vmax] The range of the parametric variables u and v is useful in two contexts. 1) <b>splot</b> in parametric mode. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_parametric">set parametric</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#set_isosamples">set isosamples</a></b>. 2) generating 2-dimension sampled data for either <b>plot</b> or <b>splot</b> using the pseudofile <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>++<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. See <b><a href="plot.html#sampling_2D">sampling 2D</a></b>. <h2 id="SECTION04029107000000000000000">Vxrange</h2>  Syntax: set vxrange [vxmin:vxmax] <p> Establishes the range of x coordinates spanned by the active voxel grid. Analogous commands <b>set vyrange</b> and <b>set vzrange</b> exist for the other two dimensions of the voxel grid. If no explicit ranges have been set prior to the first <b>vclear</b>, <b>vfill</b>, or <b>voxel(x,y,z) = </b> command, vmin and vmax will be copied from the current values of <b>xrange</b>. </p>

set walls
set wall {x0|y0|z0|x1|y1} {&lt;fillstyle&gt;} {fc &lt;fillcolor&gt;}</pre>  <p> 3D surfaces drawn by <b><a href="splot.html#splot">splot</a></b> lie within a normalized unit cube regardless of the x y and z axis ranges. The bounding walls of this cube are described by the planes (graph coord x == 0), (graph coord x == 1), etc. The <b>set walls</b> command renders the walls x0 y0 and z0 as solid surfaces. By default these surfaces are semi-transparent (fillstyle transparent solid 0.5). You can customize which walls are drawn and also their individual color and fill style. If you choose to enable walls, you may also want to use <b>set xyplane 0</b>. Example: </p>

<h3 id="SECTION04029118100000000000000">Time</h3> <b>set xdata time</b> indicates that the x coordinate represents a date or time to millisecond precision. There is an analogous command <b>set ydata time</b>. <p> There are separate format mechanisms for interpretation of time data on input and output. Input data is read from a file either by using the global <b>timefmt</b> or by using the function timecolumn() as part of the plot command. These input mechanisms also apply to using time values to set an axis range. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_timefmt">set timefmt</a></b>, <b><a href="expressions.html#timecolumn">timecolumn</a></b>. </p>
<p> Example: </p>
<pre>

You can customize the format using either <b>set format x</b> or <b>set xtics format</b>.

<h2 id="SECTION04029120000000000000000">Xlabel</h2>  The <b>set xlabel</b> command sets the x axis label. Similar commands set labels on the other axes. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set xlabel {"&lt;label&gt;"} {offset &lt;offset&gt;} {font "&lt;font&gt;{,&lt;size&gt;}"}
           {textcolor &lt;colorspec&gt;} {{no}enhanced}
           {rotate by &lt;degrees&gt; | rotate parallel | norotate}
show xlabel</pre>  <p> The same syntax applies to <b>x2label</b>, <b>ylabel</b>, <b>y2label</b>, <b>zlabel</b> and <b>cblabel</b>. </p>
<p> If <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>offset<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is specified by either x,y or x,y,z the label is moved by the given offset. It may be preceded by <b>first</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>graph</b>, <b>screen</b>, or <b>character</b> to select the coordinate system. See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b> for details. By default, the <b>character</b> coordinate system is used. For example, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><b>set xlabel offset -1,0</b><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> will change only the x offset of the title, moving the label roughly one character width to the left. The size of a character depends on both the font and the terminal. </p>
<p> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>font<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is used to specify the font in which the label is written; the units of the font <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>size<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> depend upon which terminal is used. </p>
<p> <b>noenhanced</b> requests that the label text not be processed by the enhanced text mode parser, even if enhanced text mode is currently active. </p>
<p> To clear a label, put no options on the command line, e.g., <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><b>set y2label</b><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> The default positions of the axis labels are as follows: </p>
<p> xlabel: The x-axis label is centered below the bottom of the plot. </p>
<p> ylabel: The y-axis label is centered to the left of the plot, defaulting to either horizontal or vertical orientation depending on the terminal type. The program may not reserve enough space to the left of the plot to hold long non-rotated ylabel text. You can adjust this with <b>set lmargin</b>. </p>
<p> zlabel: The z-axis label is centered along the z axis and placed in the space above the grid level. </p>
<p> cblabel: The color box axis label is centered along the box and placed below or to the right according to horizontal or vertical color box gradient. </p>
<p> y2label: The y2-axis label is placed to the right of the y2 axis. The position is terminal-dependent in the same manner as is the y-axis label. </p>
<p> x2label: The x2-axis label is placed above the plot but below the title. It is also possible to create an x2-axis label by using new-line characters to make a multi-line plot title, e.g., </p>
<pre>
set title "This is the title\n\nThis is the x2label"</pre>  <p> Note that double quotes must be used. The same font will be used for both lines, of course. </p>
<p> The orientation (rotation angle) of the x, x2, y and y2 axis labels in 2D plots can be changed by specifying <b>rotate by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>degrees<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. The orientation of the x and y axis labels in 3D plots defaults to horizontal but can be changed to run parallel to the axis by specifying <b>rotate parallel</b>. </p>
<p> If you are not satisfied with the default position of an axis label, use <b>set label</b> instead–that command gives you much more control over where text is placed. </p>

<h2 id="SECTION04029121000000000000000">Xmtics</h2>   The <b>set xmtics</b> command converts the x-axis tic marks to months of the year where 1=Jan and 12=Dec. Overflows are converted modulo 12 to months. The tics are returned to their default labels by <b>unset xmtics</b>. Similar commands perform the same duties for the other axes. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>

<h2 id="SECTION04029122000000000000000">Xrange</h2>    The <b>set xrange</b> command sets the horizontal range that will be displayed. A similar command exists for each of the other axes, as well as for the polar radius r and the parametric variables t, u, and v. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set xrange [{{&lt;min&gt;}:{&lt;max&gt;}}] {{no}reverse} {{no}writeback} {{no}extend}
           | restore
show xrange</pre>  <p> where <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>min<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>max<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> terms are constants, expressions or an asterisk to set autoscaling. If the data are time/date, you must give the range as a quoted string according to the <b>set timefmt</b> format. If <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>min<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> or <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>max<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is omitted the current value will not be changed. See below for full autoscaling syntax. See also <b><a href="set_show.html#noextend">noextend</a></b>. </p>
<p> The same syntax applies to <b>yrange</b>, <b>zrange</b>, <b>x2range</b>, <b>y2range</b>, <b>cbrange</b>, <b>rrange</b>, <b>trange</b>, <b>urange</b> and <b>vrange</b>. </p>
<p> See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_link">set link</a></b> for options that link the ranges of x and x2, or y and y2. </p>
<p> The <b>reverse</b> option reverses the direction of an autoscaled axis. For example, if the data values range from 10 to 100, it will autoscale to the equivalent of set xrange [100:10]. The <b>reverse</b> flag has no effect if the axis is not autoscaled. NB: This is a change introduced in version 4.7. </p>
<p> Autoscaling: If <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>min<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> (the same applies for correspondingly to <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>max<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>) is an asterisk <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>*<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> autoscaling is turned on. The range in which autoscaling is being performed may be limited by a lower bound <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>lb<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> or an upper bound <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ub<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> or both. The syntax is  </p>
<pre>
{ &lt;lb&gt; &lt; } * { &lt; &lt;ub&gt; }</pre>  For example,  <pre>
0 &lt; * &lt; 200</pre>  sets <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>lb<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> = 0 and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ub<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> = 200. With such a setting <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>min<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> would be autoscaled, but its final value will be between 0 and 200 (both inclusive despite the '<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>' sign). If no lower or upper bound is specified, the '<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>' to also be omitted. If <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ub<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is lower than <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>lb<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> the constraints will be turned off and full autoscaling will happen. This feature is useful to plot measured data with autoscaling but providing a limit on the range, to clip outliers, or to guarantee a minimum range that will be displayed even if the data would not need such a big range. <p> The <b>writeback</b> option essentially saves the range found by <b>autoscale</b> in the buffers that would be filled by <b>set xrange</b>. This is useful if you wish to plot several functions together but have the range determined by only some of them. The <b>writeback</b> operation is performed during the <b>plot</b> execution, so it must be specified before that command. To restore, the last saved horizontal range use <b>set xrange restore</b>. For example, </p>
<pre>
set xrange [-10:10]
set yrange [] writeback
plot sin(x)
set yrange restore
replot x/2</pre>  <p> results in a yrange of [-1:1] as found only from the range of sin(x); the [-5:5] range of x/2 is ignored. Executing <b>show yrange</b> after each command in the above example should help you understand what is going on. </p>
<p> In 2D, <b>xrange</b> and <b>yrange</b> determine the extent of the axes, <b>trange</b> determines the range of the parametric variable in parametric mode or the range of the angle in polar mode. Similarly in parametric 3D, <b>xrange</b>, <b>yrange</b>, and <b>zrange</b> govern the axes and <b>urange</b> and <b>vrange</b> govern the parametric variables. </p>
<p> In polar mode, <b>rrange</b> determines the radial range plotted. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>rmin<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> acts as an additive constant to the radius, whereas <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>rmax<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> acts as a clip to the radius — no point with radius greater than <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>rmax<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> will be plotted. <b>xrange</b> and <b>yrange</b> are affected — the ranges can be set as if the graph was of r(t)-rmin, with rmin added to all the labels. </p>
<p> Any range may be partially or totally autoscaled, although it may not make sense to autoscale a parametric variable unless it is plotted with data. </p>
<p> Ranges may also be specified on the <b>plot</b> command line. A range given on the plot line will be used for that single <b>plot</b> command; a range given by a <b>set</b> command will be used for all subsequent plots that do not specify their own ranges. The same holds true for <b>splot</b>. </p>

show xtics</pre>  <p> The same syntax applies to <b>ytics</b>, <b>ztics</b>, <b>x2tics</b>, <b>y2tics</b> and <b>cbtics</b>. </p>
<p> <b>axis</b> or <b>border</b> tells <b>gnuplot</b> to put the tics (both the tics themselves and the accompanying labels) along the axis or the border, respectively. If the axis is very close to the border, the <b>axis</b> option will move the tic labels to outside the border. The relevant margin settings will usually be sized badly by the automatic layout algorithm in this case. </p>
<p> <b>mirror</b> tells <b>gnuplot</b> to put unlabeled tics at the same positions on the opposite border. <b>nomirror</b> does what you think it does. </p>
<p> <b>in</b> and <b>out</b> change the tic marks to be drawn inwards or outwards. </p>
<p> With <b>scale</b>, the size of the tic marks can be adjusted. If <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>minor<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is not specified, it is 0.5*<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>major<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. The default size 1.0 for major tics and 0.5 for minor tics is requested by <b>scale default</b>. </p>
<p> <b>rotate</b> asks <b>gnuplot</b> to rotate the text through 90 degrees, which will be done if the terminal driver in use supports text rotation. <b>norotate</b> cancels this. <b>rotate by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ang<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> asks for rotation by <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>ang<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> degrees, supported by some terminal types. </p>
<p> The defaults are <b>border mirror norotate</b> for tics on the x and y axes, and <b>border nomirror norotate</b> for tics on the x2 and y2 axes. For the z axis, the <b>{axis <span class="MATH">|</span> border}</b> option is not available and the default is <b>nomirror</b>. If you do want to mirror the z-axis tics, you might want to create a bit more room for them with <b>set border</b>. </p>
<p> The <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>offset<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is specified by either x,y or x,y,z, and may be preceded by <b>first</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>graph</b>, <b>screen</b>, or <b>character</b> to select the coordinate system. <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>offset<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is the offset of the tics texts from their default positions, while the default coordinate system is <b>character</b>. See <b><a href="coordinates.html#coordinates">coordinates</a></b> for details. <b>nooffset</b> switches off the offset. </p>
<p> Example: </p>
<p> Move xtics more closely to the plot.  </p>
<pre>
set xtics offset 0,graph 0.05</pre>  <p> By default, tic labels are justified automatically depending on the axis and rotation angle to produce aesthetically pleasing results. If this is not desired, justification can be overridden with an explicit <b>left</b>, <b>right</b> or <b>center</b> keyword. <b>autojustify</b> restores the default behavior. </p>
<p> <b>set xtics</b> with no options restores the default border or axis if xtics are being displayed; otherwise it has no effect. Any previously specified tic frequency or position {and labels} are retained. </p>
<p> Tic positions are calculated automatically by default or if the <b>autofreq</b> option is given. </p>
<p> A series of tic positions can be specified by giving either a tic interval alone, or a start point, interval, and end point (see <b><a href="set_show.html#xtics_series">xtics series</a></b>). </p>
<p> Individual tic positions can be specified individually by providing an explicit list of positions, where each position may have an associated text label. See <b><a href="set_show.html#xtics_list">xtics list</a></b>. </p>
<p> However they are specified, tics will only be plotted when in range. </p>
<p> Format (or omission) of the tic labels is controlled by <b>set format</b>, unless the explicit text of a label is included in the <b>set xtics (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>label<span class="MATH">&gt;</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>)</b> form. </p>
<p> Minor (unlabeled) tics can be added automatically by the <b>set mxtics</b> command, or at explicit positions by the <b>set xtics (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>pos<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> 1, ...)</b> form. </p>
<p> The appearance of the tics (line style, line width etc.) is determined by the border line (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_border">set border</a></b>), even if the tics are drawn at the axes. </p>

It may contain formatting information for converting the position into its label, such as <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%3f clients<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, or it may be the empty string <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_format">set format</a></b> for more information. If no string is given, the default label (numerical) is used. </p>
<p> An explicit tic mark has a third parameter, the level. The default is level 0, a major tic. Level 1 generates a minor tic. Labels are never printed for minor tics. Major and minor tics may be auto-generated by the program or specified explicitly by the user. Tics with level 2 and higher must be explicitly specified by the user, and take priority over auto-generated tics. The size of tics marks at each level is controlled by the command <b>set tics scale</b>. </p>
<p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
set xtics ("low" 0, "medium" 50, "high" 100)
set xtics (1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024)
set ytics ("bottom" 0, "" 10, "top" 20)
set ytics ("bottom" 0, "" 10 1, "top" 20)</pre>  <p> In the second example, all tics are labeled. In the third, only the end tics are labeled. In the fourth, the unlabeled tic is a minor tic. </p>
<p> Normally if explicit tics are given, they are used instead of auto-generated tics. Conversely if you specify <b>set xtics auto</b> or the like it will erase any previously specified explicit tics. You can mix explicit and auto- generated tics by using the keyword <b>add</b>, which must appear before the tic style being added. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set xtics 0,.5,10
set xtics add ("Pi" 3.14159)</pre>  <p> This will automatically generate tic marks every 0.5 along x, but will also add an explicit labeled tic mark at pi. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION04029123300000000000000">Xtics timedata</h3> Times and dates are stored internally as a number of seconds. <p> Input: Non-numeric time and date values are converted to seconds on input using the format specifier in <b>timefmt</b>. Axis positions and range limits also may be given as quoted dates or times interpreted using <b>timefmt</b>. If the <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>start<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>incr<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>end<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> form is used, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>incr<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> must be in seconds. Use of <b>timefmt</b> to interpret input data, range, and tic positions is triggered by <b>set xdata time</b>. </p>
<p> Output: Axis tic labels are generated using a separate format specified either by <b>set format</b> or <b>set xtics format</b>. By default the usual numeric format specifiers are expected (<b>set xtics numeric</b>). Other options are geographic coordinates (<b>set xtics geographic</b>), or times or dates (<b>set xtics time</b>). </p>
<p> Note: For backward compatibility with earlier gnuplot versions, the command <b>set xdata time</b> will implicitly also do <b>set xtics time</b>, and <b>set xdata</b> or <b>unset xdata</b> will implicitly reset to <b>set xtics numeric</b>. However you can change this with a later call to <b>set xtics</b>. </p>
<p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
set xdata time           # controls interpretation of input data
set timefmt "%d/%m"      # format used to read input data
set xtics timedate       # controls interpretation of output format
set xtics format "%b %d" # format used for tic labels
set xrange ["01/12":"06/12"]
set xtics "01/12", 172800, "05/12"</pre>  <pre>
set xdata time
set timefmt "%d/%m"
set xtics format "%b %d" time
set xrange ["01/12":"06/12"]
set xtics ("01/12", "" "03/12", "05/12")</pre>  Both of these will produce tics <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Dec 1<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Dec 3<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Dec 5<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, but in the second example the tic at <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Dec 3<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> will be unlabeled. <h3 id="SECTION04029123400000000000000">Geographic</h3>  <b>set xtics geographic</b> indicates that x-axis values are to be interpreted as a geographic coordinate measured in degrees. Use <b>set xtics format</b> or <b>set format x</b> to specify the appearance of the axis tick labels. The format specifiers for geographic data are as follows:  <pre>
%D                   = integer degrees
%&lt;width.precision&gt;d  = floating point degrees
%M                   = integer minutes
%&lt;width.precision&gt;m  = floating point minutes
%S                   = integer seconds
%&lt;width.precision&gt;s  = floating point seconds
%E                   = label with E/W instead of +/-
%N                   = label with N/S instead of +/-</pre>  For example, the command <b>set format x <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%Ddeg %5.2mmin %E<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b> will cause x coordinate -1.51 to be labeled as <b><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> 1deg 30.60min W<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b>. <p> If the xtics are left in the default state (<b>set xtics numeric</b>) the coordinate will be reported as a decimal number of degrees, and <b>format</b> will be assumed to contain normal numeric format specifiers rather than the special set above. </p>
<p> To output degrees/minutes/seconds in a context other than axis tics, such as placing labels on a map, you can use the relative time format specifiers %tH %tM %tS for strptime. See <b><a href="set_show.html#time_specifiers">time_specifiers</a></b>, <b><a href="expressions.html#strptime">strptime</a></b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION04029123500000000000000">Xtics logscale</h3>  If the <b>logscale</b> attribute is set for a tic series along a log-scaled axis, the tic interval is interpreted as a multiplicative factor rather than a constant. For example:  <pre>
# generate a series of tics at y=20 y=200 y=2000 y=20000
set log y
set ytics 20, 10, 50000 logscale</pre>  Note that no tic is placed at y=50000 because it is not in the series 2*10<code>^</code>x. If the logscale property is disabled, the tic increment will be treated as an additive constant even for a log-scaled axis. For example:  <pre>
# generate a series of tics at y=20 y=40 y=60 ... y=200
set log y
set yrange [20:200]
set ytics 20 nologscale</pre>  The <b>logscale</b> attribute is set automatically by the <b>set log</b> command, so normally you do not need this keyword unless you want to force a constant tic interval as in the second example above. <h3 id="SECTION04029123600000000000000">Xtics rangelimited</h3>   This option limits both the auto-generated axis tic labels and the corresponding plot border to the range of values actually present in the data that has been plotted. Note that this is independent of the current range limits for the plot. For example, suppose that the data in <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>file.dat<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> all lies in the range 2 <span class="MATH">&lt;</span> y <span class="MATH">&lt;</span> 4. Then the following commands will create a plot for which the left-hand plot border (y axis) is drawn for only this portion of the total y range, and only the axis tics in this region are generated. I.e., the plot will be scaled to the full range on y, but there will be a gap between 0 and 2 on the left border and another gap between 4 and 10. This style is sometimes referred to as a <b>range-frame</b> graph.  <pre>
set border 3
set yrange [0:10]
set ytics nomirror rangelimited
plot "file.dat"</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION04029124000000000000000">Xyplane</h2>  The <b>set xyplane</b> command adjusts the position at which the xy plane is drawn in a 3D plot. The synonym <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>set ticslevel<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is accepted for backwards compatibility. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
set xyplane at &lt;zvalue&gt;
set xyplane relative &lt;frac&gt;
set ticslevel &lt;frac&gt;        # equivalent to set xyplane relative
show xyplane</pre>  <p> The form <b>set xyplane relative <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>frac<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> places the xy plane below the range in Z, where the distance from the xy plane to Zmin is given as a fraction of the total range in z. The default value is 0.5. Negative values are permitted, but tic labels on the three axes may overlap. </p>
<p> The alternative form <b>set xyplane at <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>zvalue<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b> fixes the placement of the xy plane at a specific Z value regardless of the current z range. Thus to force the x, y, and z axes to meet at a common origin one would specify <b>set xyplane at 0</b>. </p>
