<h1 id="SECTION040240000000000000000">Refresh</h1>  The <b>refresh</b> command is similar to <b>replot</b>, with two major differences. <b>refresh</b> reformats and redraws the current plot using the data already read in. This means that you can use <b>refresh</b> for plots with inline data (pseudo-device '-') and for plots from datafiles whose contents are volatile. You cannot use the <b>refresh</b> command to add new data to an existing plot. <p> Mousing operations, in particular zoom and unzoom, will use <b>refresh</b> rather than <b>replot</b> if appropriate. Example: </p>
<pre>
plot 'datafile' volatile with lines, '-' with labels
100 200 "Special point"
e
# Various mousing operations go here
set title "Zoomed in view"
set term post
set output 'zoom.ps'
refresh</pre><div class="_attribution">
