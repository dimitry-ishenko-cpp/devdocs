<h1 id="SECTION03040000000000000000">Boxes</h1>  In 2D plots the <b>boxes</b> style draws a rectangle centered about the given x coordinate that extends from the x axis, i.e. from y=0 not from the graph border, to the given y coordinate. The width of the box can be provided in an additional input column or controlled by <b>set boxwidth</b>. Otherwise each box extends to touch the adjacent boxes. <p> In 3D plots the <b>boxes</b> style draws a box centered at the given [x,y] coordinate that extends from the plane at z=0 to the given z coordinate. The width of the box on x can be provided in a separate input column or via <b>set boxwidth</b>. The depth of the box on y is controlled by <b>set boxdepth</b>. Boxes do not automatically expand to touch each other as in 2D plots. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION03041000000000000000">2D boxes</h2>  <p> <b>plot with boxes</b> uses 2 or 3 columns of basic data. Additional input columns may be used to provide information such as variable line or fill color. See <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles.html#rgbcolor_variable">rgbcolor variable</a></b>. </p>
<pre>
2 columns:  x  y
3 columns:  x  y  x_width</pre>  <p> The width of the box is obtained in one of three ways. If the input data has a third column, this will be used to set the box width. Otherwise if a width has been set using the <b>set boxwidth</b> command, this will be used. If neither of these is available, the width of each box will be calculated so that it touches the adjacent boxes. </p>
<p> The box interiors are drawn using the current fillstyle. Alternatively a fillstyle may be specified in the plot command. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_style_fill">set style fill</a></b>. If no fillcolor is given in the plot command, the current line color is used. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> To plot a data file with solid filled boxes with a small vertical space separating them (bargraph): </p>
<pre>
set boxwidth 0.9 relative
set style fill solid 1.0
plot 'file.dat' with boxes</pre>  <p> To plot a sine and a cosine curve in pattern-filled boxes style: </p>
<pre>
set style fill pattern
plot sin(x) with boxes, cos(x) with boxes</pre>  <p> The sin plot will use pattern 0; the cos plot will use pattern 1. Any additional plots would cycle through the patterns supported by the terminal driver. </p>
<p> To specify explicit fillstyles and fillcolors for each dataset: </p>
<pre>
plot 'file1' with boxes fs solid 0.25 fc 'cyan', \
     'file2' with boxes fs solid 0.50 fc 'blue', \
     'file3' with boxes fs solid 0.75 fc 'magenta', \
     'file4' with boxes fill pattern 1, \
     'file5' with boxes fill empty</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION03042000000000000000">3D boxes</h2>  <p> <b>splot with boxes</b> requires at least 3 columns of input data. Additional input columns may be used to provide information such as box width or fill color. </p>
<pre>
3 columns:  x  y  z
4 columns:  x  y  z  [x_width or color]
5 columns:  x  y  z  x_width  color</pre>  <p> The last column is used as a color only if the splot command specifies a variable color mode. Examples </p>
<pre>
splot 'blue_boxes.dat' using 1:2:3 fc "blue"
splot 'rgb_boxes.dat' using 1:2:3:4 fc rgb variable
splot 'category_boxes.dat' using 1:2:3:4:5 lc variable</pre>  <p> In the first example all boxes are blue and have the width previously set by <b>set boxwidth</b>. In the second example the box width is still taken from <b>set boxwidth</b> because the 4th column is interpreted as a 24-bit RGB color. The third example command reads box width from column 4 and interprets the value in column 5 as an integer linetype from which the color is derived. </p>
<p> By default boxes have no thickness; they consist of a single rectangle parallel to the xz plane at the specified y coordinate. You can change this to a true box with four sides and a top by setting a non-zero extent on y. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_boxdepth">set boxdepth</a></b>. </p>
<p> 3D boxes are processed as pm3d quadrangles rather than as surfaces. Because of this the front/back order of drawing is not affected by <b>set hidden3d</b>. Similarly if you want each box face to have a border you must use <b>set pm3d border</b> rather than <b>set style fill border</b>. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_pm3d">set pm3d</a></b>. For best results use a combination of <b>set pm3d depthorder base</b> and <b>set pm3d lighting</b>. </p><div class="_attribution">
