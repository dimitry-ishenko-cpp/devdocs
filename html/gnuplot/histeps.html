<h1 id="SECTION030150000000000000000">Histeps</h1>  The <b>histeps</b> style is only relevant to 2D plotting. It is intended for plotting histograms. Y-values are assumed to be centered at the x-values; the point at x1 is represented as a horizontal line from ((x0+x1)/2,y1) to ((x1+x2)/2,y1). The lines representing the end points are extended so that the step is centered on at x. Adjacent points are connected by a vertical line at their average x, that is, from ((x1+x2)/2,y1) to ((x1+x2)/2,y2). The input column requires are the same as for plot styles <b>lines</b> and <b>points</b>. <p> If <b>autoscale</b> is in effect, it selects the xrange from the data rather than the steps, so the end points will appear only half as wide as the others.
