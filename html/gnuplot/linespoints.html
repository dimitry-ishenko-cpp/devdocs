<h1 id="SECTION030210000000000000000">Linespoints</h1>     The <b>linespoints</b> style (short form <b>lp</b>) connects adjacent points with straight line segments and then goes back to draw a small symbol at each point. Points are drawn with the default size determined by <b>set pointsize</b> unless a specific point size is given in the plot command or a variable point size is provided in an additional column of input data. Additional input columns may also be used to provide information such as variable line color. See <b><a href="lines.html#lines">lines</a></b> and <b><a href="points.html#points">points</a></b>. <p> Two keywords control whether or not every point in the plot is marked with a symbol, <b>pointinterval</b> (short form <b>pi</b>) and <b>pointnumber</b> (short form <b>pn</b>). </p>
<p> <b>pi N</b> or <b>pi -N</b> tells gnuplot to only place a symbol on every Nth point. A negative value for N will erase the portion of line segment that passes underneath the symbol. The size of the erased portion is controlled by <b>set pointintervalbox</b>. </p>
<p> <b>pn N</b> or <b>pn -N</b> tells gnuplot to label only N of the data points, evenly spaced over the data set. As with <b>pi</b>, a negative value for N will erase the portion of line segment that passes underneath the symbol. </p><div class="_attribution">
