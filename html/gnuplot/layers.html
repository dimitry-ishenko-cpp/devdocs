<h1 id="SECTION020220000000000000000">Layers</h1>     A gnuplot plot is built up by drawing its various components in a fixed order. This order can be modified by assigning some components to a specific layer using the keywords <b>behind</b>, <b>back</b>, or <b>front</b>. For example, to replace the background color of the plot area you could define a colored rectangle with the attribute <b>behind</b>.  <pre>
set object 1 rectangle from graph 0,0 to graph 1,1 fc rgb "gray" behind</pre>  The order of drawing is  <pre>
behind
back
the plot itself
the plot legend (`key`)
front</pre>  Within each layer elements are drawn in the order  <pre>
grid, axis, and border elements
pixmaps in numerical order
objects (rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons) in numerical order
labels in numerical order
arrows in numerical order</pre>  In the case of multiple plots on a single page (multiplot mode) this order applies separately to each component plot, not to the multiplot as a whole.<div class="_attribution">
