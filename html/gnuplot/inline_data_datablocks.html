<h1 id="SECTION020190000000000000000">Inline data and datablocks</h1>   There are two mechanisms for embedding data into a stream of gnuplot commands. If the special filename '-' appears in a plot command, then the lines immediately following the plot command are interpreted as inline data. See <b><a href="plot.html#special-filenames">special-filenames</a></b>. Data provided in this way can only be used once, by the plot command it follows. <p> The second mechanism defines a named data block as a here-document. The named data is persistent and may be referred to by more than one plot command. Example:  </p>
<pre>
$Mydata &lt;&lt; EOD
11 22 33 first line of data
44 55 66 second line of data
# comments work just as in a data file
77 88 99
EOD
stats $Mydata using 1:3
plot $Mydata using 1:3 with points, $Mydata using 1:2 with impulses</pre>  <p> Data block names must begin with a $ character, which distinguishes them from other types of persistent variables. The end-of-data delimiter (EOD in the example) may be any sequence of alphanumeric characters. </p>
<p> The storage associated with named data blocks can be released using <b>undefine</b> command. <b>undefine $*</b> frees all named data blocks at once. </p><div class="_attribution">
