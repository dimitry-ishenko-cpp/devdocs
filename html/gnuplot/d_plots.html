<h1 id="SECTION030370000000000000000">3D plots</h1>  3D plots are generated using the command <b>splot</b> rather than <b>plot</b>. Many of the 2D plot styles (points, images, impulse, labels, vectors) can also be used in 3D by providing an extra column of data containing z coordinate. Some plot types (pm3d coloring, surfaces, contours) must be generated using the <b>splot</b> command even if only a 2D projection is wanted. <h2 id="SECTION030371000000000000000">Surface plots</h2>  The styles <b>splot with lines</b> and <b>splot with surface</b> both generate a surface made from a grid of lines. Solid surfaces can be generated using the style <b>splot with pm3d</b>. Usually the surface is displayed at some convenient viewing angle, such that it clearly represents a 3D surface. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_view">set view</a></b>. In this case the X, Y, and Z axes are all visible in the plot. The illusion of 3D is enhanced by choosing hidden line removal. See <b><a href="set_show.html#hidden3d">hidden3d</a></b>. The <b>splot</b> command can also calculate and draw contour lines corresponding to constant Z values. These contour lines may be drawn onto the surface itself, or projected onto the XY plane. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_contour">set contour</a></b>. <h2 id="SECTION030372000000000000000">2D projection (set view map)</h2> An important special case of the <b>splot</b> command is to map the Z coordinate onto a 2D surface by projecting the plot along the Z axis onto the xy plane. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_view_map">set view map</a></b>. This plot mode is useful for contour plots and heat maps. This figure shows contours plotted once with plot style <b>lines</b> and once with style <b>labels</b>. <h2 id="SECTION030373000000000000000">PM3D plots</h2> 3D surfaces can also be drawn using solid pm3d quadrangles rather than lines. In this case there is no hidden surface removal, but if the component facets are drawn back-to-front then a similar effect is achieved. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_pm3d_depthorder">set pm3d depthorder</a></b>. While pm3d surfaces are by default colored using a smooth color palette (see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_palette">set palette</a></b>), it is also possible to specify a solid color surface or to specify distinct solid colors for the top and bottom surfaces as in the figure shown here. See <b><a href="set_show.html#pm3d_fillcolor">pm3d fillcolor</a></b>. Unlike the line-trimming in hidden3d mode, pm3d surfaces can be smoothly clipped to the current zrange. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_pm3d_clipping">set pm3d clipping</a></b>.<div class="_attribution">
