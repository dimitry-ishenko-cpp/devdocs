<h1 id="SECTION040280000000000000000">Save</h1>  Syntax:  <pre>
save  {functions | variables | terminal | set | fit} '&lt;filename&gt;'</pre>  <p> If no option is specified, <b>gnuplot</b> saves functions, variables, <b>set</b> options and the last <b>plot</b> (<b>splot</b>) command. </p>
<p> <b>save</b>d files are written in text format and may be read by the <b>load</b> command. For <b>save</b> with the <b>set</b> option or without any option, the <b>terminal</b> choice and the <b>output</b> filename are written out as a comment, to get an output file that works in other installations of gnuplot, without changes and without risk of unwillingly overwriting files. </p>
<p> <b>save terminal</b> will write out just the <b>terminal</b> status, without the comment marker in front of it. This is mainly useful for switching the <b>terminal</b> setting for a short while, and getting back to the previously set terminal, afterwards, by loading the saved <b>terminal</b> status. Note that for a single gnuplot session you may rather use the other method of saving and restoring current terminal by the commands <b>set term push</b> and <b>set term pop</b>, see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_term">set term</a></b>. </p>
<p> <b>save fit</b> saves only the variables used in the most recent <b>fit</b> command. The saved file may be used as a parameter file to initialize future fit commands using the <b>via</b> keyword. </p>
<p> The filename must be enclosed in quotes. </p>
<p> The special filename <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>-<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> may be used to <b>save</b> commands to standard output. On systems which support a popen function (Unix), the output of save can be piped through an external program by starting the file name with a '<span class="MATH">|</span>'. This provides a consistent interface to <b>gnuplot</b>'s internal settings to programs which communicate with <b>gnuplot</b> through a pipe. Please see help for <b><a href="batch_interactive_operation.html#batch_interactive">batch/interactive</a></b> for more details. </p>
