<h1 id="SECTION030110000000000000000">Filledcurves</h1>  The <b>filledcurves</b> style is only used for 2D plotting. It has three variants. The first two variants require either a single function or two columns (x,y) of input data, and may be further modified by the options listed below. <p> Syntax: </p>
<pre>
plot ... with filledcurves [option]</pre>  <p> where the option can be one of the following </p>
<pre>
[closed | {above | below}
{x1 | x2 | y | r}[=&lt;a&gt;] | xy=&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;]</pre>  <p> The first variant, <b>closed</b>, treats the curve itself as a closed polygon. This is the default if there are two columns of input data. </p>
<p> The second variant is to fill the area between the curve and a given axis, a horizontal or vertical line, or a point. </p>
<pre>
filledcurves closed   ... just filled closed curve,
filledcurves x1       ... x1 axis,
filledcurves x2       ... x2 axis, etc for y1 and y2 axes,
filledcurves y=42     ... line at y=42, i.e. parallel to x axis,
filledcurves xy=10,20 ... point 10,20 of x1,y1 axes (arc-like shape).
filledcurves above r=1.5  the area of a polar plot outside radius 1.5</pre>  <p> The third variant fills the area between two curves sampled at the same set of x coordinates. It requires three columns of input data (x, y1, y2). This is the default if there are three or more columns of input data. If you have a y value in column 2 and an associated error value in column 3 the area of uncertainty can be represented by shading. See also the similar 3D plot style <b><a href="zerrorfill.html#zerrorfill">zerrorfill</a></b>. </p>
<pre>
3 columns:  x  y  yerror</pre>  <pre>
plot $DAT using 1:($2-$3):($2+$3) with filledcurves, \
     $DAT using 1:2 smooth mcs with lines</pre>  <p> The <b>above</b> and <b>below</b> options apply both to commands of the form  </p>
<pre>
... filledcurves above {x1|x2|y|r}=&lt;val&gt;</pre>  and to commands of the form  <pre>
... using 1:2:3 with filledcurves below</pre>  In either case the option limits the filled area to one side of the bounding line or curve. <p> Notes: Not all terminal types support this plotting mode.  </p>
<pre>
The x= and y= keywords are ignored for 3 columns data plots</pre>  <p> Zooming a filled curve drawn from a datafile may produce empty or incorrect areas because gnuplot is clipping points and lines, and not areas. </p>
<p> If the values <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>x<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>y<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, or <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>a<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> are outside the drawing boundary they are moved to the graph boundary. Then the actual fill area in the case of option xy=<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>x<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>,<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>y<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> will depend on xrange and yrange. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION030111000000000000000">Fill properties</h2>  Plotting <b>with filledcurves</b> can be further customized by giving a fillstyle (solid/transparent/pattern) or a fillcolor. If no fillstyle (<b>fs</b>) is given in the plot command then the current default fill style is used. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_style_fill">set style fill</a></b>. If no fillcolor (<b>fc</b>) is given in the plot command, the usual linetype color sequence is followed. <p> The {{no}border} property of the fillstyle is honored by filledcurves mode <b>closed</b>, the default. It is ignored by all other filledcurves modes. Example:  </p>
<pre>
plot 'data' with filledcurves fc "cyan" fs solid 0.5 border lc "blue"</pre><div class="_attribution">
