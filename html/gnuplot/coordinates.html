<h1 id="SECTION020120000000000000000">Coordinates</h1>   The commands <b>set arrow</b>, <b>set key</b>, <b>set label</b> and <b>set object</b> allow you to draw something at an arbitrary position on the graph. This position is specified by the syntax: <pre>
{&lt;system&gt;} &lt;x&gt;, {&lt;system&gt;} &lt;y&gt; {,{&lt;system&gt;} &lt;z&gt;}</pre>  <p> Each <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>system<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> can either be <b>first</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>polar</b>, <b>graph</b>, <b>screen</b>, or <b>character</b>. </p>
<p> <b>first</b> places the x, y, or z coordinate in the system defined by the left and bottom axes; <b>second</b> places it in the system defined by the x2,y2 axes (top and right); <b>graph</b> specifies the area within the axes — 0,0 is bottom left and 1,1 is top right (for splot, 0,0,0 is bottom left of plotting area; use negative z to get to the base — see <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xyplane">set xyplane</a></b>); <b>screen</b> specifies the screen area (the entire area — not just the portion selected by <b>set size</b>), with 0,0 at bottom left and 1,1 at top right. <b>character</b> coordinates are used primarily for offsets, not absolute positions. The <b>character</b> vertical and horizontal size depend on the current font. </p>
<p> <b>polar</b> causes the first two values to be interpreted as angle theta and radius r rather than as x and y. This could be used, for example, to place labels on a 2D plot in polar coordinates or a 3D plot in cylindrical coordinates. </p>
<p> If the coordinate system for x is not specified, <b>first</b> is used. If the system for y is not specified, the one used for x is adopted. </p>
<p> In some cases, the given coordinate is not an absolute position but a relative value (e.g., the second position in <b>set arrow</b> ... <b>rto</b>). In most cases, the given value serves as difference to the first position. If the given coordinate belongs to a log-scaled axis, a relative value is interpreted as multiplier. For example, </p>
<pre>
set logscale x
set arrow 100,5 rto 10,2</pre>  <p> plots an arrow from position 100,5 to position 1000,7 since the x axis is logarithmic while the y axis is linear. </p>
<p> If one (or more) axis is timeseries, the appropriate coordinate should be given as a quoted time string according to the <b>timefmt</b> format string. See <b><a href="set_show.html#set_xdata">set xdata</a></b> and <b><a href="set_show.html#set_timefmt">set timefmt</a></b>. <b>Gnuplot</b> will also accept an integer expression, which will be interpreted as seconds relative to 1 January 1970. </p><div class="_attribution">
