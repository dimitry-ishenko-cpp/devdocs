<h1 id="SECTION040100000000000000000">Help</h1>  The <b>help</b> command displays built-in help. To specify information on a particular topic use the syntax: <pre>
help {&lt;topic&gt;}</pre>  <p> If <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>topic<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is not specified, a short message is printed about <b>gnuplot</b>. After help for the requested topic is given, a menu of subtopics is given; help for a subtopic may be requested by typing its name, extending the help request. After that subtopic has been printed, the request may be extended again or you may go back one level to the previous topic. Eventually, the <b>gnuplot</b> command line will return. </p>
<p> If a question mark (?) is given as the topic, the list of topics currently available is printed on the screen. </p><div class="_attribution">
