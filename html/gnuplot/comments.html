<h1 id="SECTION020110000000000000000">Comments</h1>  The comment character <b>#</b> may appear almost anywhere in a command line, and <b>gnuplot</b> will ignore the rest of that line. A <b>#</b> does not have this effect inside a quoted string. Note that if a commented line ends in ' <span class="MATH">\</span>' then the subsequent line is also treated as part of the comment. <p> See also <b><a href="set_show.html#set_datafile_commentschars">set datafile commentschars</a></b> for specifying a comment character for data files. </p><div class="_attribution">
