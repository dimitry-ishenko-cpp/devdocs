<h1 id="SECTION030380000000000000000">Fence plots</h1>   Fence plots combine several 2D plots by aligning their Y coordinates and separating them from each other by a displacement along X. Filling the area between a base value and each plot's series of Z values enhances the visual impact of the alignment on Y and comparison on Z. There are several ways such plots can be created in gnuplot. The simplest is to use the 5 column variant of the <b>zerrorfill</b> style. Suppose there are separate curves z = Fi(y) indexed by i. A fence plot is generated by <b>splot with zerrorfill</b> using input columns  <pre>
