<h1 id="SECTION020180000000000000000">Glossary</h1>  Throughout this document an attempt has been made to maintain consistency of nomenclature. This cannot be wholly successful because as <b>gnuplot</b> has evolved over time, certain command and keyword names have been adopted that preclude such perfection. This section contains explanations of the way some of these terms are used. <p> A <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>page<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>screen<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>canvas<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is the entire area addressable by <b>gnuplot</b>. On a desktop it is a full window; on a plotter, it is a single sheet of paper; in svga mode it is the full monitor screen. </p>
<p> A screen may contain one or more <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>plots<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. A plot is defined by an abscissa and an ordinate, although these need not actually appear on it, as well as the margins and any text written therein. </p>
<p> A plot contains one <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>graph<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. A graph is defined by an abscissa and an ordinate, although these need not actually appear on it. </p>
<p> A graph may contain one or more <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>lines<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. A line is a single function or data set. <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Line<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is also a plotting style. The word will also be used in sense <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>a line of text<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. Presumably the context will remove any ambiguity. </p>
<p> The lines on a graph may have individual names. These may be listed together with a sample of the plotting style used to represent them in the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>key<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, sometimes also called the <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>legend<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. </p>
<p> The word <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>title<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> occurs with multiple meanings in <b>gnuplot</b>. In this document, it will always be preceded by the adjective <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>plot<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>line<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>key<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> to differentiate among them. A 2D graph may have up to four labeled <b>axes</b>. The names of the four axes are <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>x<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> for the axis along the bottom border of the plot, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>y<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> for the axis along the left border, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>x2<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> for the top border, and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>y2<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> for the right border. See <b><a href="plot.html#axes">axes</a></b>. </p>
<p> A 3D graph may have up to three labeled <b>axes</b> â€“ <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>x<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>y<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>z<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. It is not possible to say where on the graph any particular axis will fall because you can change the direction from which the graph is seen with <b>set view</b>. </p>
<p> When discussing data files, the term <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>record<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> will be resurrected and used to denote a single line of text in the file, that is, the characters between newline or end-of-record characters. A <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>point<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is the datum extracted from a single record. A <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>block<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> of data is a set of consecutive records delimited by blank records. A line, when referred to in the context of a data file, is a subset of a block. Note that the term <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>data block<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> may also be used to refer to a named block inline data (see <b><a href="inline_data_datablocks.html#datablocks">datablocks</a></b>). </p><div class="_attribution">
