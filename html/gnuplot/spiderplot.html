<h1 id="SECTION030260000000000000000">Spiderplot</h1>  Spider plots are essentially parallel axis plots in which the axes are arranged radially rather than vertically. Such plots are sometimes called <b>rader charts</b>. In gnuplot this requires working within a coordinate system established by the command <b>set spiderplot</b>, analogous to <b>set polar</b> except that the angular coordinate is determined implicitly by the parallel axis number. The appearance, labelling, and tic placement of the axes is controlled by <b>set paxis</b>. Further style choices are controlled using <b><a href="set_show.html#set_style_spiderplot">set style spiderplot</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show.html#set_grid">set grid</a></b>, and the individual components of the plot command. <p> Because each spider plot corresponds to a row of data rather than a column, it would make no sense to generate key entry titles in the normal way. Instead, if a plot component contains a title the text is used to label the corresponding axis. This overrides any previous <b>set paxis n label <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Foo<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b>. To place a title in the key, you can either use a separate <b>keyentry</b> command or extract text from a column in the input file with the <b>key(column)</b> using specifier. See <b><a href="set_show.html#keyentry">keyentry</a></b>, <b><a href="plot.html#using_key">using key</a></b>. </p>
<p> In this figure a spiderplot with 5 axes is used to compare multiple entities that are each characterized by five scores. Each line (row) in $DATA generates a new polygon on the plot. </p>

In order to describe multiple polygons in the same plot command, they must be separated by <b>newspiderplot</b>. Example:  <pre>
# One polygon with 10 vertices
plot for [i=1:5] 'A' using i, for [j=1:5] 'B' using j
# Two polygons with 5 vertices
plot for [i=1:5] 'A' using i, newspiderplot, for [j=1:5] 'B' using j</pre><div class="_attribution">
