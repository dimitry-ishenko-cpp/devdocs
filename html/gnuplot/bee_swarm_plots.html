<h1 id="SECTION03020000000000000000">Bee swarm plots</h1>   <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Bee swarm<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> plots result from applying jitter to separate overlapping points. A typical use is to compare the distribution of y values exhibited by two or more categories of points, where the category determines the x coordinate. See the <b><a href="set_show.html#set_jitter">set jitter</a></b> command for how to control the overlap criteria and the displacement pattern used for jittering. The plots in the figure were created by the same plot command but different jitter settings. <pre>
