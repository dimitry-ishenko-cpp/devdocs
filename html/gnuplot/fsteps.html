<h1 id="SECTION030130000000000000000">Fsteps</h1>  The <b>fsteps</b> style is only relevant to 2D plotting. It connects consecutive points with two line segments: the first from (x1,y1) to (x1,y2) and the second from (x1,y2) to (x2,y2). The input column requires are the same as for plot styles <b>lines</b> and <b>points</b>. The difference between <b>fsteps</b> and <b>steps</b> is that <b>fsteps</b> traces first the change in y and then the change in x. <b>steps</b> traces first the change in x and then the change in y. <p> See also <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/steps.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">steps demo. </span></a> </p><div class="_attribution">
