<h1 id="SECTION030330000000000000000">Yerrorbars</h1>  The <b>yerrorbars</b> (or <b>errorbars</b>) style is only relevant to 2D data plots. <b>yerrorbars</b> is like <b>points</b>, except that a vertical error bar is also drawn. At each point (x,y), a line is drawn from (x,y-ydelta) to (x,y+ydelta) or from (x,ylow) to (x,yhigh), depending on how many data columns are provided. The appearance of the tic mark at the ends of the bar is controlled by <b>set errorbars</b>. <pre>
2 columns:  [implicit x] y ydelta
3 columns:  x  y  ydelta
4 columns:  x  y  ylow  yhigh</pre>  <p> An additional input column (4th or 5th) may be used to provide information such as variable point color. </p>
