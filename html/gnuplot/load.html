<h1 id="SECTION040150000000000000000">Load</h1>  The <b>load</b> command executes each line of the specified input file as if it had been typed in interactively. Files created by the <b>save</b> command can later be <b>load</b>ed. Any text file containing valid commands can be created and then executed by the <b>load</b> command. Files being <b>load</b>ed may themselves contain <b>load</b> or <b>call</b> commands. See <b><a href="comments.html#comments">comments</a></b> for information about comments in commands. To <b>load</b> with arguments, see <b><a href="call.html#call">call</a></b>. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
load "&lt;input-file&gt;"</pre>  <p> The name of the input file must be enclosed in quotes. </p>
<p> The special filename <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>-<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> may be used to <b>load</b> commands from standard input. This allows a <b>gnuplot</b> command file to accept some commands from standard input. Please see help for <b><a href="batch_interactive_operation.html#batch_interactive">batch/interactive</a></b> for more details. </p>
<p> On some systems which support a popen function (Unix), the load file can be read from a pipe by starting the file name with a '<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>'. </p>
<p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
load 'work.gnu'
load "func.dat"
load "&lt; loadfile_generator.sh"</pre>  <p> The <b>load</b> command is performed implicitly on any file names given as arguments to <b>gnuplot</b>. These are loaded in the order specified, and then <b>gnuplot</b> exits. </p><div class="_attribution">
