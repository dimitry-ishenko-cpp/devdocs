<h1 id="SECTION040370000000000000000">Unset</h1>   Options set using the <b>set</b> command may be returned to their default state by the corresponding <b>unset</b> command. The <b>unset</b> command may contain an optional iteration clause. See <b><a href="plot.html#plot_for">plot for</a></b>. <p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
set xtics mirror rotate by -45 0,10,100
...
unset xtics</pre>  <pre>
# Unset labels numbered between 100 and 200
unset for [i=100:200] label i</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION040371000000000000000">Linetype</h2> Syntax:  <pre>
unset linetype N</pre>  Remove all characteristics previously associated with a single linetype. Subsequent use of this linetype will use whatever characteristics and color that is native to the current terminal type (i.e. the default linetypes properties available in gnuplot versions prior to 4.6). <h2 id="SECTION040372000000000000000">Monochrome</h2> Switches the active set of linetypes from monochrome to color. Equivalent to <b>set color</b>. <h2 id="SECTION040373000000000000000">Output</h2> Because some terminal types allow multiple plots to be written into a single output file, the output file is not automatically closed after plotting. In order to print or otherwise use the file safely, it should first be closed explicitly by using <b>unset output</b> or by using <b>set output</b> to close the previous file and then open a new one. <h2 id="SECTION040374000000000000000">Terminal</h2> The default terminal that is active at the time of program entry depends on the system platform, gnuplot build options, and the environmental variable GNUTERM. Whatever this default may be, gnuplot saves it to internal variable GNUTERM. The <b>unset terminal</b> command restores the initial terminal type. It is equivalent to <b>set terminal GNUTERM</b>. However if the string in GNUTERM contains terminal options in addition to the bare terminal name, you may want to instead use <b>set terminal @GNUTERM</b>.<div class="_attribution">
