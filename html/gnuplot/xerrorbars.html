<h1 id="SECTION030310000000000000000">Xerrorbars</h1>  The <b>xerrorbars</b> style is only relevant to 2D data plots. <b>xerrorbars</b> is like <b>points</b>, except that a horizontal error bar is also drawn. At each point (x,y), a line is drawn from (xlow,y) to (xhigh,y) or from (x-xdelta,y) to (x+xdelta,y), depending on how many data columns are provided. The appearance of the tic mark at the ends of the bar is controlled by <b>set errorbars</b>. The basic style requires either 3 or 4 columns: <pre>
3 columns:  x  y  xdelta
4 columns:  x  y  xlow  xhigh</pre>  <p> An additional input column (4th or 5th) may be used to provide information such as variable point color. </p><div class="_attribution">
