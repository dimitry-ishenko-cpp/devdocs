<h1 id="SECTION040270000000000000000">Reset</h1>   <pre>
reset {bind | errors | session}</pre>  <p> The <b>reset</b> command causes all graph-related options that can be set with the <b>set</b> command to return to their default values. This command can be used to restore the default settings after executing a loaded command file, or to return to a defined state after lots of settings have been changed. </p>
<p> The following are <em>not</em> affected by <b>reset</b>:  </p>
<pre>
`set term` `set output` `set loadpath` `set linetype` `set fit`
`set encoding` `set decimalsign` `set locale` `set psdir`
`set overflow` `set multiplot`</pre>  <p> Note that <b>reset</b> does not necessarily return settings to the state they were in at program entry, because the default values may have been altered by commands in the initialization files gnuplotrc or $HOME/.gnuplot. However, these commands can be re-executed by using the variant command <b>reset session</b>. </p>
<p>  <b>reset session</b> deletes any user-defined variables and functions, restores default settings, and then re-executes the system-wide gnuplotrc initialization file and any private $HOME/.gnuplot preferences file. See <b><a href="start_up_initialization.html#initialization">initialization</a></b>. </p>
<p>  <b>reset errors</b> clears only the error state variables GPVAL_ERRNO and GPVAL_ERRMSG. </p>
<p>  <b>reset bind</b> restores all hotkey bindings to their default state. </p><div class="_attribution">
