<h1 id="SECTION020240000000000000000">Persist</h1>  Many gnuplot terminals (aqua, pm, qt, x11, windows, wxt, ...) open separate display windows on the screen into which plots are drawn. The <b>persist</b> option tells gnuplot to leave these windows open when the main program exits. It has no effect on non-interactive terminal output. For example if you issue the command <pre>
gnuplot -persist -e 'plot [-5:5] sinh(x)'</pre>  <p> gnuplot will open a display window, draw the plot into it, and then exit, leaving the display window containing the plot on the screen. You can also specify <b>persist</b> or <b>nopersist</b> when you set a new terminal. </p>
<pre>
set term qt persist size 700,500</pre>  <p> Depending on the terminal type, some mousing operations may still be possible in the persistent window. However operations like zoom/unzoom that require redrawing the plot are not possible because the main program has exited. If you want to leave a plot window open and fully mouseable after creating the plot, for example when running gnuplot from a script file rather than interactively, see <b><a href="pause.html#pause_mouse_close">pause mouse close</a></b>. </p><div class="_attribution">
