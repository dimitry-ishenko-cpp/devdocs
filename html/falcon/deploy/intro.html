<h1 id="preamble-disclaimer">Preamble &amp; Disclaimer</h1> <p>Falcon conforms to the standard <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">WSGI protocol</a> that most Python web applications have been using since 2003. If you have deployed Python applications like Django, Flask, or others, you will find yourself quite at home with Falcon and your standard Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn, or other WSGI servers should suffice.</p> <p>There are many ways to deploy a Python application. The aim of these quickstarts is to simply get you up and running, not to give you a perfectly tuned or secure environment. You will almost certainly need to customize these configurations for any serious production deployment.</p><div class="_attribution">
