<h1 id="id1">Middleware</h1> <p id="middleware">Middleware components provide a way to execute logic before the framework routes each request, after each request is routed but before the target responder is called, or just before the response is returned for each request.

        Note:
            Because Falcon routes each request based on req.path, a

            attribute to a new value from within process_request().

</pre> <div class="admonition tip"> <p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p> <p>Because <em>process_request</em> executes before routing has occurred, if a component modifies <code>req.path</code> in its <em>process_request</em> method, the framework will use the modified value to route the request.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre data-language="python"># Route requests based on the host header.
req.path = '/' + req.host + req.path
</pre> </div> <div class="admonition tip"> <p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p> <p class="last">The <em>process_resource</em> method is only called when the request matches a route to a resource. To take action when a route is not found, a <a class="reference internal" href="api.html#falcon.API.add_sink" title="falcon.API.add_sink"><code>sink</code></a> may be used instead.</p> </div> <div class="admonition tip"> <p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p> <p class="last">In order to pass data from a middleware function to a resource function use the <code>req.context</code> and <code>resp.context</code> objects. These context objects are intended to hold request and response data specific to your app as it passes through the framework.</p> </div> <p>Each component’s <em>process_request</em>, <em>process_resource</em>, and <em>process_response</em> methods are executed hierarchically, as a stack, following the ordering of the list passed via the <code>middleware</code> kwarg of <a class="reference internal" href="api.html#api"><span class="std std-ref">falcon.API</span></a>. For example, if a list of middleware objects are passed as <code>[mob1, mob2, mob3]</code>, the order of execution is as follows:</p> <pre data-language="python">mob1.process_request
    mob2.process_request
        mob3.process_request
            mob1.process_resource
                mob2.process_resource
                    mob3.process_resource
            &lt;route to resource responder method&gt;
        mob3.process_response
    mob2.process_response
mob1.process_response
</pre> <p>Note that each component need not implement all <code>process_*</code> methods; in the case that one of the three methods is missing, it is treated as a noop in the stack. For example, if <code>mob2</code> did not implement <em>process_request</em> and <code>mob3</code> did not implement <em>process_response</em>, the execution order would look like this:</p> <pre data-language="python">mob1.process_request
    _
        mob3.process_request
            mob1.process_resource
                mob2.process_resource
                    mob3.process_resource

        _
    mob2.process_response
mob1.process_response
</pre>  <h2 id="short-circuiting">Short-circuiting</h2> <p>A <em>process_request</em> middleware method may short-circuit further request processing by setting <a class="reference internal" href="request_and_response.html#falcon.Response.complete" title="falcon.Response.complete"><code>complete</code></a> to <code>True</code>, e.g.:</p> <pre data-language="python">resp.complete = True
</pre> <p>After the method returns, setting this flag will cause the framework to skip any remaining <em>process_request</em> and <em>process_resource</em> methods, as well as the responder method that the request would have been routed to. However, any <em>process_response</em> middleware methods will still be called.</p> <p>In a similar manner, setting <a class="reference internal" href="request_and_response.html#falcon.Response.complete" title="falcon.Response.complete"><code>complete</code></a> to <code>True</code> from within a <em>process_resource</em> method will short-circuit further request processing at that point.</p> <p>This feature affords use cases in which the response may be pre-constructed, such as in the case of caching.</p>   <h2 id="exception-handling">Exception Handling</h2> <p>If one of the <em>process_request</em> middleware methods raises an exception, it will be processed according to the exception type. If the type matches a registered error handler, that handler will be invoked and then the framework will begin to unwind the stack, skipping any lower layers. The error handler may itself raise an instance of <a class="reference internal" href="errors.html#falcon.HTTPError" title="falcon.HTTPError"><code>HTTPError</code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="status.html#falcon.HTTPStatus" title="falcon.HTTPStatus"><code>HTTPStatus</code></a>, in which case the framework will use the latter exception to update the <em>resp</em> object.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">By default, the framework installs two handlers, one for <a class="reference internal" href="errors.html#falcon.HTTPError" title="falcon.HTTPError"><code>HTTPError</code></a> and one for <a class="reference internal" href="status.html#falcon.HTTPStatus" title="falcon.HTTPStatus"><code>HTTPStatus</code></a>. These can be overridden via <a class="reference internal" href="api.html#falcon.API.add_error_handler" title="falcon.API.add_error_handler"><code>add_error_handler()</code></a>.</p> </div> <p>Regardless, the framework will continue unwinding the middleware stack. For example, if <em>mob2.process_request</em> were to raise an error, the framework would execute the stack as follows:</p> <pre data-language="python">mob1.process_request
    mob2.process_request
        &lt;skip mob1/mob2 process_resource&gt;
        &lt;skip mob3.process_request&gt;
        &lt;skip mob3.process_resource&gt;
        &lt;skip route to resource responder method&gt;
        mob3.process_response
    mob2.process_response
mob1.process_response
</pre> <p>As illustrated above, by default, all <em>process_response</em> methods will be executed, even when a <em>process_request</em>, <em>process_resource</em>, or resource responder raises an error. This behavior is controlled by the <a class="reference internal" href="api.html#api"><span class="std std-ref">API class’s</span></a> <code>independent_middleware</code> keyword argument.</p> <p>Finally, if one of the <em>process_response</em> methods raises an error, or the routed <code>on_*</code> responder method itself raises an error, the exception will be handled in a similar manner as above. Then, the framework will execute any remaining middleware on the stack.</p><div class="_attribution">
