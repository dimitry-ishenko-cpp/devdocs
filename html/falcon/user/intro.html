<h1 id="id1">Introduction</h1>  <p>Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.</p> <p><em>- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</em></p>  <p><a class="reference external" href="https://falconframework.org">Falcon</a> is a reliable, high-performance Python web framework for building large-scale app backends and microservices. It encourages the REST architectural style, and tries to do as little as possible while remaining highly effective.</p> <p>Falcon apps work with any WSGI server, and run like a champ under CPython 2.7/3.5+ and PyPy.</p>  <h2 id="how-is-falcon-different">How is Falcon different?</h2> <p>We designed Falcon to support the demanding needs of large-scale microservices and responsive app backends. Falcon complements more general Python web frameworks by providing bare-metal performance, reliability, and flexibility wherever you need it.</p> <p><strong>Fast.</strong> Same hardware, more requests. Falcon turns around requests several times faster than most other Python frameworks. For an extra speed boost, Falcon compiles itself with Cython when available, and also works well with <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org">PyPy</a>. Considering a move to another programming language? Benchmark with Falcon + PyPy first.</p> <p><strong>Reliable.</strong> We go to great lengths to avoid introducing breaking changes, and when we do they are fully documented and only introduced (in the spirit of <a class="reference external" href="http://semver.org/">SemVer</a>) with a major version increment. The code is rigorously tested with numerous inputs and we require 100% coverage at all times. Falcon does not depend on any external Python packages.</p> <p><strong>Flexible.</strong> Falcon leaves a lot of decisions and implementation details to you, the API developer. This gives you a lot of freedom to customize and tune your implementation. Due to Falcon’s minimalist design, Python community members are free to independently innovate on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki">Falcon add-ons and complementary packages</a>.</p> <p><strong>Debuggable.</strong> Falcon eschews magic. It’s easy to tell which inputs lead to which outputs. Unhandled exceptions are never encapsulated or masked. Potentially surprising behaviors, such as automatic request body parsing, are well-documented and disabled by default. Finally, when it comes to the framework itself, we take care to keep logic paths simple and understandable. All this makes it easier to reason about the code and to debug edge cases in large-scale deployments.</p>   <h2 id="features">Features</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>Highly-optimized, extensible code base</li> <li>Intuitive routing via URI templates and REST-inspired resource classes</li> <li>Easy access to headers and bodies through request and response classes</li> <li>DRY request processing via middleware components and hooks</li> <li>Idiomatic HTTP error responses</li> <li>Straightforward exception handling</li> <li>Snappy unit testing through WSGI helpers and mocks</li> <li>Supports Python 2.7, 3.5+</li> <li>Compatible with PyPy</li> </ul>   <h2 id="about-apache-2-0">About Apache 2.0</h2> <p>Falcon is released under the terms of the <a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0">Apache 2.0 License</a>.
