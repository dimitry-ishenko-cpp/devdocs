<h1 id="install">Installation</h1>  <h2 id="installation">PyPy</h2> <p><a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> is the fastest way to run your Falcon app. Both PyPy2.7 and PyPy3.5 are supported as of PyPy v5.10.</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ pip install falcon
</pre> <p>Or, to install the latest beta or release candidate, if any:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ pip install --pre falcon
</pre>   <h2 id="cpython">CPython</h2> <p>Falcon also fully supports <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">CPython</a> 2.7 and 3.5+.</p> <p>Universal and manylinux wheels are available on PyPI for the Falcon framework. Installation is as simple as:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ pip install falcon
</pre> <p>Installing one of the pre-built Falcon wheels is a great way to get up and running quickly. However, when deploying your application in production, you may wish to compile Falcon via Cython yourself, using the target system’s native toolchain.</p> <p>The following commands tell pip to install Cython, and then to invoke Falcon’s <code>setup.py</code>, which will in turn detect the presence of Cython and then compile (AKA cythonize) the Falcon framework with the system’s default C compiler.</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ pip install cython
$ pip install --no-binary :all: falcon
</pre> <p>If you want to verify that Cython is being invoked, simply pass <code>-v</code> to pip in order to echo the compilation commands:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ pip install -v --no-binary :all: falcon
</pre> <p><strong>Installing on OS X</strong></p> <p>Xcode Command Line Tools are required to compile Cython. Install them with this command:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ xcode-select --install
</pre> <p>The Clang compiler treats unrecognized command-line options as errors, for example:</p> <pre data-language="bash">clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]
</pre> <p>You might also see warnings about unused functions. You can work around these issues by setting additional Clang C compiler flags as follows:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ export CFLAGS="-Qunused-arguments -Wno-unused-function"
</pre>   <h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2> <p>Falcon does not require the installation of any other packages, although if Cython has been installed into the environment, it will be used to optimize the framework as explained above.</p>   <h2 id="wsgi-server">WSGI Server</h2> <p>Falcon speaks WSGI, and so in order to serve a Falcon app, you will need a WSGI server. Gunicorn and uWSGI are some of the more popular ones out there, but anything that can load a WSGI app will do.</p> <p>All Windows developers can use Waitress production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance. Unfortunately Gunicorn is still not working on Windows and uWSGI need to have Cygwin on Windows installed. Waitress can be good alternative for Windows users if they want quick start using Falcon on it.</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ pip install [gunicorn|uwsgi|waitress]
</pre>   <h2 id="source-code">Source Code</h2> <p>Falcon <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/falconry/falcon">lives on GitHub</a>, making the code easy to browse, download, fork, etc. Pull requests are always welcome! Also, please remember to star the project if it makes you happy. :)</p> <p>Once you have cloned the repo or downloaded a tarball from GitHub, you can install Falcon like this:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ cd falcon
$ pip install .
</pre> <p>Or, if you want to edit the code, first fork the main repo, clone the fork to your desktop, and then run the following to install it using symbolic linking, so that when you change your code, the changes will be automagically available to your app without having to reinstall the package:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ cd falcon
$ pip install -e .
</pre> <p>You can manually test changes to the Falcon framework by switching to the directory of the cloned repo and then running pytest:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ cd falcon
$ pip install -r requirements/tests
$ pytest tests
</pre> <p>Or, to run the default set of tests:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ pip install tox &amp;&amp; tox
</pre> <div class="admonition tip"> <p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p> <p class="last">See also the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/master/tox.ini">tox.ini</a> file for a full list of available environments.</p> </div> <p>Finally, to build Falcon’s docs from source, simply run:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ pip install tox &amp;&amp; tox -e docs
</pre> <p>Once the docs have been built, you can view them by opening the following index page in your browser. On OS X it’s as simple as:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ open docs/_build/html/index.html
</pre> <p>Or on Linux:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ xdg-open docs/_build/html/index.html
