<h1> Optional Features </h1>  <div id="ember354175" class="ember-view">
<p>One of the ways that Ember releases guarantee stability is by following <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> (SemVer). For the Ember project this means that any feature that is to be removed must first be deprecated, and only removed when a major version is released. It also means that new features are introduced in a backwards compatible way.</p> <p>To give the project a path forward when a breaking change is mandatory, we've released the <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-optional-features"><code>@ember/optional-features</code></a> addon.</p> <p>This addon does nothing by default, but provides a command-line interface to enable and disable breaking changes in Ember.</p> <h2 id="toc_installation">Installation</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_installation"> <p>To get started with optional features, you must install the addon:</p> <pre><code class="bash language-bash">ember install @ember/optional-features
</code></pre> <p>This will make three new commands available to Ember CLI within your project, <code>feature:list</code>, <code>feature:enable</code>, and <code>feature:disable</code>.</p> </section> <h2 id="toc_listing-features">Listing features</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_listing-features"> <p>The optional features available to your project will depend on the Ember version your project is using.</p> <p>To see which optional features are available, you can run the following command:</p> <pre><code class="bash language-bash">$ ember feature:list
Usage:

  To list all available features, run ember feature:list.
  To enable a feature, run ember feature:enable some-feature.
  To disable a feature, run ember feature:disable some-feature.

Available features:

  some-example-feature (Default: true)
    A description of the feature goes here
    More information: &lt;link to an RFC&gt;
</code></pre> </section> <h2 id="toc_features">Features</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_features"> <p>Once you see a feature that you would like to toggle for your project you can run one of two commands, <code>ember feature:enable &lt;feature&gt;</code> and <code>ember feature:disable &lt;feature&gt;</code>.</p> <p>Let us disable an optional feature to see what happens. Substitute <code>some-example-feature</code> for a real feature name when you run this command.</p> <pre><code class="bash language-bash">$ ember feature:disable some-example-feature
Disabled some-example-feature. Be sure to commit config/optional-features.json to source control!
</code></pre> <p>As we can see from the warning, <code>@ember/optional-features</code> has created a file in <code>config/optional-features.json</code> to store the configuration for your project. We commit it to our repository and we are off to the races!</p>  </section> </div> <div class="_attribution">
