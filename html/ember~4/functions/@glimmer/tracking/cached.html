The return value of the getter will be cached until any of the properties it is entangled with are invalidated. This is useful when a getter is expensive and used very often.</p> <p>For instance, in this <code>GuestList</code> class, we have the <code>sortedGuests</code> getter that sorts the guests alphabetically:</p> <pre class="highlight javascript" data-language="javascript">  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

  class GuestList {
    @tracked guests = ['Zoey', 'Tomster'];

    get sortedGuests() {
      return this.guests.slice().sort()
    }
  }</pre> <p>Every time <code>sortedGuests</code> is accessed, a new array will be created and sorted, because JavaScript getters do not cache by default. When the guest list is small, like the one in the example, this is not a problem. However, if the guest list were to grow very large, it would mean that we would be doing a large amount of work each time we accessed <code>sortedGuests</code>. With <code>@cached</code>, we can cache the value instead:</p> <pre class="highlight javascript" data-language="javascript">  import { tracked, cached } from '@glimmer/tracking';

  class GuestList {
    @tracked guests = ['Zoey', 'Tomster'];

    @cached
    get sortedGuests() {
      return this.guests.slice().sort()
    }
  }</pre> <p>Now the <code>sortedGuests</code> getter will be cached based on autotracking. It will only rerun and create a new sorted array when the guests tracked property is updated.</p> <h4 id="tradeoffs">Tradeoffs</h4> <p>Overuse is discouraged.</p> <p>In general, you should avoid using <code>@cached</code> unless you have confirmed that the getter you are decorating is computationally expensive, since <code>@cached</code> adds a small amount of overhead to the getter. While the individual costs are small, a systematic use of the <code>@cached</code> decorator can add up to a large impact overall in your app. Many getters and tracked properties are only accessed once during rendering, and then never rerendered, so adding <code>@cached</code> when unnecessary can negatively impact performance.</p> <p>Also, <code>@cached</code> may rerun even if the values themselves have not changed, since tracked properties will always invalidate. For example updating an integer value from <code>5</code> to an other <code>5</code> will trigger a rerun of the cached properties building from this integer.</p> <p>Avoiding a cache invalidation in this case is not something that can be achieved on the <code>@cached</code> decorator itself, but rather when updating the underlying tracked values, by applying some diff checking mechanisms:</p> <pre class="highlight javascript" data-language="javascript">if (nextValue !== this.trackedProp) {
  this.trackedProp = nextValue;
}</pre> <p>Here equal values won't update the property, therefore not triggering the subsequent cache invalidations of the <code>@cached</code> properties who were using this <code>trackedProp</code>.</p> <p>As a reminder, do not use this piece of code inside a tracked getter, as the dependency chain could lead to an infinite loop. Mutating an adjacent property from a getter is not a good practice anyway, even with a caching mechanism reducing reruns.</p> <p>The cost of these edge-guards adds up to the trade-off calculation of using a caching strategy, hence requiring a very sensitive and moderate approach regarding performance.</p><div class="_attribution">
