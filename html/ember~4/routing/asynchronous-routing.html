<h1> Asynchronous Routing </h1>  <div id="ember361203" class="ember-view">
<p>This section covers some more advanced features of the router and its capability for handling complex async logic within your app.</p> <h2 id="toc_a-word-on-promises">A Word on Promises...</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_a-word-on-promises"> <p>Ember's approach to handling asynchronous logic in the router makes heavy use of the concept of Promises. In short, promises are objects that represent an eventual value. A promise can either <em>fulfill</em> (successfully resolve the value) or <em>reject</em> (fail to resolve the value). The way to retrieve this eventual value, or handle the cases when the promise rejects, is via the promise's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then"><code>then()</code></a> method, which accepts two optional callbacks, one for fulfillment and one for rejection. If the promise fulfills, the fulfillment handler gets called with the fulfilled value as its sole argument, and if the promise rejects, the rejection handler gets called with a reason for the rejection as its sole argument. For example:</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">let promise = fetchTheAnswer();

promise.then(fulfillCallback, rejectCallback);

function fulfillCallback(answer) {
  console.log(`The answer is ${answer}`);
}

function rejectCallback(reason) {
  console.log(`Couldn't get the answer! Reason: ${reason}`);
}
</code></pre> <p>Much of the power of promises comes from the fact that they can be chained together to perform sequential asynchronous operations:</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">import fetch from 'fetch';

let usernamesPromise = fetch('/usernames.json');

usernamesPromise.then(response =&gt; response.json())
                .then(fetchPhotosOfUsers)
                .then(applyInstagramFilters)
                .then(uploadTrendyPhotoAlbum)
                .then(displaySuccessMessage, handleErrors);
</code></pre> <p>In the above example, if any of the methods <code>fetchPhotosOfUsers</code>, <code>applyInstagramFilters</code>, or <code>uploadTrendyPhotoAlbum</code> returns a promise that rejects, <code>handleErrors</code> will be called with the reason for the failure. In this manner, promises approximate an asynchronous form of try-catch statements that prevent the rightward flow of nested callback after nested callback and facilitate a saner approach to managing complex asynchronous logic in your applications.</p> </section> <h2 id="toc_the-router-pauses-for-promises">The Router Pauses for Promises</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_the-router-pauses-for-promises"> <p>When transitioning between routes, the Ember router collects all of the models (via the <code>model</code> hook) that will be passed to the route's controllers at the end of the transition. If the <code>model</code> hook (or the related <code>beforeModel</code> or <code>afterModel</code> hooks) return normal (non-promise) objects or arrays, the transition will complete immediately. But if the <code>model</code> hook (or the related <code>beforeModel</code> or <code>afterModel</code> hooks) returns a promise (or if a promise was provided as an argument to <code>transitionTo</code>), the transition will pause until that promise fulfills or rejects.</p> <p>The router considers any object with a <code>then()</code> method defined on it to be a promise.</p> <p>If the promise fulfills, the transition will pick up where it left off and begin resolving the next (child) route's model, pausing if it too is a promise, and so on, until all destination route models have been resolved. The values passed to the <a href="https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Route/methods#setupController"><code>setupController()</code></a> hook for each route will be the fulfilled values from the promises.</p> <p>A basic example:</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="app/routes/tardy.js">import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { later } from '@ember/runloop';

export default class TardyRoute extends Route {
  model() {
    return new Promise(function(resolve) {
      later(function() {
        resolve({ msg: 'Hold Your Horses' });
      }, 3000);
    });
  }

  setupController(controller, model) {
    console.log(model.msg); // "Hold Your Horses"
  }
}
</code></pre> <p>When transitioning into <code>route:tardy</code>, the <code>model()</code> hook will be called and return a promise that won't resolve until 3 seconds later, during which time the router will be paused in mid-transition. When the promise eventually fulfills, the router will continue transitioning and eventually call <code>route:tardy</code>'s <code>setupController()</code> hook with the resolved object.</p> <p>This pause-on-promise behavior is extremely valuable for when you need to guarantee that a route's data has fully loaded before displaying a new template.</p> </section> <h2 id="toc_when-promises-reject">When Promises Reject...</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_when-promises-reject"> <p>We've covered the case when a model promise fulfills, but what if it rejects?</p> <p>By default, if a model promise rejects during a transition, the transition is aborted, no new destination route templates are rendered, and an error is logged to the console.</p> <p>You can configure this error-handling logic via the <code>error</code> handler. When a promise rejects, an <code>error</code> event will be fired on that route and bubble up to <code>route:application</code>'s default error handler unless it is handled by a custom error handler along the way, e.g.:</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="app/routes/good-for-nothing.js">import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { action } from '@ember/object';
// import { service } from '@ember/service';

export default class GoodForNothingRoute extends Route {
  // @service router;

  model() {
    return Promise.reject("FAIL");
  }

  @action
  error(reason) {
    alert(reason); // "FAIL"

    // Can transition to another route here, e.g.
    // this.router.transitionTo('index');

    // Uncomment the line below to bubble this error event:
    // return true;
  }
}
</code></pre> <p>In the above example, the error event would stop right at <code>route:good-for-nothing</code>'s error handler and not continue to bubble. To make the event continue bubbling up to <code>route:application</code>, you can <code>return true;</code> from the error handler.</p> </section> <h2 id="toc_recovering-from-rejection">Recovering from Rejection</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_recovering-from-rejection"> <p>Rejected model promises halt transitions, but because promises are chainable, you can catch promise rejects within the <code>model</code> hook itself and convert them into fulfills that won't halt the transition.</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="app/routes/funky.js">import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

export default class FunkyRoute extends Route {
  model() {
    return iHopeThisWorks().catch(function() {
      // Promise rejected, fulfill with some default value to
      // use as the route's model and continue on with the transition
      return { msg: 'Recovered from rejected promise' };
    });
  }
}
