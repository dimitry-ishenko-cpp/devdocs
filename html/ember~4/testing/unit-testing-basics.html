<h1> Testing Basics </h1>  <div id="ember365801" class="ember-view">
<p>Unit tests (as well as container tests) are generally used to test a small piece of code and ensure that it is doing what was intended. Unlike application tests, they are narrow in scope and do not require the Ember application to be running.</p> <p>Let's have a look at a common use case - testing a service - to understand the basic principles of testing in Ember. This will set the foundation for other parts of your Ember application such as controllers, components, helpers and others. Testing a service is as simple as creating a container test, looking up the service on the application's container and running assertions against it.</p> <h2 id="toc_testing-computed-properties">Testing Computed Properties</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_testing-computed-properties"> <p>Let's start by creating a service that has a <code>computedFoo</code> computed property based on a <code>foo</code> property.</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="app/services/some-thing.js">import Service from '@ember/service';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

export default class SomeThingService extends Service {
  @tracked foo = 'bar';

  get computedFoo() {
    return `computed ${this.foo}`;
  }
}
</code></pre> <p>Within the test for this object, we'll lookup the service instance, update the <code>foo</code> property (which should trigger the computed property), and assert that the logic in our computed property is working correctly.</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="tests/unit/service/some-thing-test.js">import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupTest } from 'ember-qunit';

module('Unit | Service | some thing', function(hooks) {
  setupTest(hooks);

  test('should correctly concat foo', function(assert) {
    const someThing = this.owner.lookup('service:some-thing');
    someThing.foo = 'baz';

    assert.equal(someThing.computedFoo, 'computed baz');
  });
});
</code></pre> <p>See that first, we are creating a new testing module using the <a href="http://api.qunitjs.com/QUnit/module"><code>QUnit.module</code></a> function. This will scope all of our tests together into one group that can be configured and run independently from other modules defined in our test suite. Also, we have used <code>setupTest</code>, one of the several test helpers provided by <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-qunit">ember-qunit</a>. The <code>setupTest</code> helper provides us with some conveniences, such as the <code>this.owner</code> object, that helps us to create or lookup objects which are needed to setup our test. In this example, we use the <code>this.owner</code> object to lookup the service instance that becomes our test subject: <code>someThing</code>. Note that in a unit test you can customize any object under test by setting its properties accordingly. We can use the <code>set</code> method of the test object to achieve this.</p> </section> <h2 id="toc_testing-object-methods">Testing Object Methods</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_testing-object-methods"> <p>Next let's look at testing logic found within an object's method. In this case the <code>testMethod</code> method alters some internal state of the object (by updating the <code>foo</code> property).</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="app/services/some-thing.js">import Service from '@ember/service';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

export default class SomeThingService extends Service {
  @tracked foo = 'bar';

  testMethod() {
    this.foo = 'baz';
  }
}
</code></pre> <p>To test it, we create an instance of our class <code>SomeThing</code> as defined above, call the <code>testMethod</code> method and assert that the internal state is correct as a result of the method call.</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="tests/unit/services/some-thing-test.js">import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupTest } from 'ember-qunit';

module('Unit | Service | some thing', function(hooks) {
  setupTest(hooks);

  test('should update foo on testMethod', function(assert) {
    const someThing = this.owner.lookup('service:some-thing');

    someThing.testMethod();

    assert.equal(someThing.foo, 'baz');
  });
});
</code></pre> <p>In case the object's method returns a value, you can simply assert that the return value is calculated correctly. Suppose our object has a <code>calc</code> method that returns a value based on some internal state.</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="app/services/some-thing.js">import Service from '@ember/service';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

export default class SomeThingService extends Service {
  @tracked count = 0;

  calc() {
    this.count += 1;
    return `count: ${this.count}`;
  }
}
</code></pre> <p>The test would call the <code>calc</code> method and assert it gets back the correct value.</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="tests/unit/services/some-thing-test.js">import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupTest } from 'ember-qunit';

module('Unit | Service | some thing', function(hooks) {
  setupTest(hooks);

  test('should return incremented count on calc', function(assert) {
    const someThing = this.owner.lookup('service:some-thing');

    assert.equal(someThing.calc(), 'count: 1');
    assert.equal(someThing.calc(), 'count: 2');
  });
});
</code></pre> </section> <h2 id="toc_skipping-tests">Skipping tests</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_skipping-tests"> <p>Some times you might be working on a feature, but know that a certain test will fail so you might want to skip it. You can do it by using <code>skip</code>:</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">import { test, skip } from 'qunit';

test('run this test', function(assert) {
  assert.ok(true);
});

skip('skip this test', function(assert) {
  assert.ok(true);
});
</code></pre> </section> <h2 id="toc_stubs">Stubs</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_stubs"> <p>Unit tests are often testing methods that call other methods or work with other objects. A stub is a substitute method or object to be used during the test. This isolates a unit test to the actual method under test.</p> </section> <h3 id="toc_stubbing-a-method">Stubbing a method</h3> <section aria-labelledby="toc_stubbing-a-method"> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="app/services/some-thing.js">import Service from '@ember/service';

export default class SomeThingService extends Service {
  someComplicatedOtherMethod(x) {
    return x * 2;
  }

  testMethod(y) {
    let z = this.someComplicatedOtherMethod(y);
    return `Answer: ${z}`;
  }
}
</code></pre> <p><code>someComplicatedOtherMethod</code> might have complex behavior that you do not want failing your unit test for <code>testMethod</code>, because you know <code>testMethod</code> works otherwise. Isolating unit tests is best practice because the tests that are failing should directly point to the method that is failing, allowing you to quickly fix it rather than figuring out which method the error is in. In we stub the other method:</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="tests/unit/services/some-thing-test.js">import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupTest } from 'ember-qunit';

module('Unit | Service | some thing', function(hooks) {
  setupTest(hooks);

  test('testMethod should return result of someComplicatedOtherFunction', function(assert) {
    const someThing = this.owner.lookup('service:some-thing');
    const originalSomeComplicatedOtherMethod =
      someThing.someComplicatedOtherMethod;
    someThing.someComplicatedOtherMethod = function() {
      return 4;
    };

    assert.equal(someThing.testMethod(2), 'Answer 4', 'testMethod is working');

    someThing.someComplicatedOtherMethod = originalSomeComplicatedOtherMethod;
  });
});
</code></pre> </section> <h3 id="toc_stubbing-an-object">Stubbing an object</h3> <section aria-labelledby="toc_stubbing-an-object"> <p>You can also stub an object:</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="app/services/employees.js">import Service from '@ember/service';

export default class EmployeesService extends Service {
  employees = [];

  hire(person) {
    person.addJob();
    this.employees.push(person);
    return `${person.title} ${person.name} is now an employee`;
  }
}
</code></pre> <p>Here, you need to pass a person object, which could be a complex class. The <code>addJob</code> method in <code>Person</code> could be complex as well, perhaps requiring another class. Instead, create a simple object and pass it instead.</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="tests/unit/services/employees-test.js">import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupTest } from 'ember-qunit';

module('Unit | Service | employees', function(hooks) {
  setupTest(hooks);

  test('hire adds a person to employees array', function(assert) {
    const someThing = this.owner.lookup('service:some-thing');

    class MockPerson {
      title = 'Dr.';
      name = 'Zoey';
      addJob() {}
    }

    let person = new MockPerson();

    assert.equal(someThing.hire(person), 'Dr. Zoey is now an employee');
  });
