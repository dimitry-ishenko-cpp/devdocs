<h2 id="deprecations">Deprecations</h2> <p>EmberData allows users to opt-in and remove code that exists to support deprecated behaviors.</p> <p>If your app has resolved all deprecations present in a given version, you may specify that version as your "compatibility" version to remove the code that supported the deprecated behavior from your app.</p> <p>For instance, if a deprecation was introduced in 3.13, and the app specifies 3.13 as its minimum version compatibility, any deprecations introduced before or during 3.13 would be stripped away.</p> <p>An app can use a different version than what it specifies as it's compatibility version. For instance, an App could be using <code>3.16</code> while specifying compatibility with <code>3.12</code>. This would remove any deprecations that were present in or before <code>3.12</code> but keep support for anything deprecated in or above <code>3.13</code>.</p> <h3 id="configuring-compatibility">Configuring Compatibility</h3> <p>To configure your compatibility version, set the <code>compatWith</code> to the version you are compatible with on the <code>emberData</code> config in your <code>ember-cli-build.js</code> file.</p> <pre class="highlight javascript" data-language="javascript">let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  emberData: {
    compatWith: '3.12',
  },
});</pre> <p>The complete list of which versions specific deprecations will be removed in can be found <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/tree/master/packages/private-build-infra/addon/current-deprecations.ts" title="List of EmberData Deprecations">here</a></p>     </article><div class="_attribution">
