<h1>Variable Declaration</h1>
<p><code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are two relatively new concepts for variable declarations in JavaScript. <a href="basic-types.html#a-note-about-let">As we mentioned earlier</a>, <code>let</code> is similar to <code>var</code> in some respects, but allows users to avoid some of the common “gotchas” that users run into in JavaScript.</p> <p><code>const</code> is an augmentation of <code>let</code> in that it prevents re-assignment to a variable.</p> <p>With TypeScript being an extension of JavaScript, the language naturally supports <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>. Here we’ll elaborate more on these new declarations and why they’re preferable to <code>var</code>.</p> <p>If you’ve used JavaScript offhandedly, the next section might be a good way to refresh your memory. If you’re intimately familiar with all the quirks of <code>var</code> declarations in JavaScript, you might find it easier to skip ahead.</p> <h2 id="var-declarations" style="position:relative;">
<code>var</code> declarations</h2> <p>Declaring a variable in JavaScript has always traditionally been done with the <code>var</code> keyword.</p> <pre data-language="ts">var a = 10;</pre> <p>As you might’ve figured out, we just declared a variable named <code>a</code> with the value <code>10</code>.</p> <p>We can also declare a variable inside of a function:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f() {
  var message = "Hello, world!";

  return message;
}</pre> <p>and we can also access those same variables within other functions:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f() {
  var a = 10;
  return function g() {
    var b = a + 1;
    return b;
  };
}

var g = f();
g(); // returns '11'</pre> <p>In this above example, <code>g</code> captured the variable <code>a</code> declared in <code>f</code>. At any point that <code>g</code> gets called, the value of <code>a</code> will be tied to the value of <code>a</code> in <code>f</code>. Even if <code>g</code> is called once <code>f</code> is done running, it will be able to access and modify <code>a</code>.</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f() {
  var a = 1;

  a = 2;
  var b = g();
  a = 3;

  return b;

  function g() {
    return a;
  }
}

f(); // returns '2'</pre> <h3 id="scoping-rules" style="position:relative;">Scoping rules</h3> <p><code>var</code> declarations have some odd scoping rules for those used to other languages. Take the following example:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f(shouldInitialize: boolean) {
  if (shouldInitialize) {
    var x = 10;
  }

  return x;
}

f(true); // returns '10'
f(false); // returns 'undefined'</pre> <p>Some readers might do a double-take at this example. The variable <code>x</code> was declared <em>within the <code>if</code> block</em>, and yet we were able to access it from outside that block. That’s because <code>var</code> declarations are accessible anywhere within their containing function, module, namespace, or global scope - all which we’ll go over later on - regardless of the containing block. Some people call this <em><code>var</code>-scoping</em> or <em>function-scoping</em>. Parameters are also function scoped.</p> <p>These scoping rules can cause several types of mistakes. One problem they exacerbate is the fact that it is not an error to declare the same variable multiple times:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; matrix.length; i++) {
    var currentRow = matrix[i];
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; currentRow.length; i++) {
      sum += currentRow[i];
    }
  }

  return sum;
}</pre> <p>Maybe it was easy to spot out for some experienced JavaScript developers, but the inner <code>for</code>-loop will accidentally overwrite the variable <code>i</code> because <code>i</code> refers to the same function-scoped variable. As experienced developers know by now, similar sorts of bugs slip through code reviews and can be an endless source of frustration.</p> <h3 id="variable-capturing-quirks" style="position:relative;">Variable capturing quirks</h3> <p>Take a quick second to guess what the output of the following snippet is:</p> <pre data-language="ts">for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, 100 * i);
}</pre> <p>For those unfamiliar, <code>setTimeout</code> will try to execute a function after a certain number of milliseconds (though waiting for anything else to stop running).</p> <p>Ready? Take a look:</p> <pre data-language="typescript">10
10
10
10
10
10
10
10
10
10</pre> <p>Many JavaScript developers are intimately familiar with this behavior, but if you’re surprised, you’re certainly not alone. Most people expect the output to be</p> <pre data-language="typescript">0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9</pre> <p>Remember what we mentioned earlier about variable capturing? Every function expression we pass to <code>setTimeout</code> actually refers to the same <code>i</code> from the same scope.</p> <p>Let’s take a minute to consider what that means. <code>setTimeout</code> will run a function after some number of milliseconds, <em>but only</em> after the <code>for</code> loop has stopped executing; By the time the <code>for</code> loop has stopped executing, the value of <code>i</code> is <code>10</code>. So each time the given function gets called, it will print out <code>10</code>!</p> <p>A common work around is to use an IIFE - an Immediately Invoked Function Expression - to capture <code>i</code> at each iteration:</p> <pre data-language="ts">for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  // capture the current state of 'i'
  // by invoking a function with its current value
  (function (i) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(i);
    }, 100 * i);
  })(i);
}</pre> <p>This odd-looking pattern is actually pretty common. The <code>i</code> in the parameter list actually shadows the <code>i</code> declared in the <code>for</code> loop, but since we named them the same, we didn’t have to modify the loop body too much.</p> <h2 id="let-declarations" style="position:relative;">
<code>let</code> declarations</h2> <p>By now you’ve figured out that <code>var</code> has some problems, which is precisely why <code>let</code> statements were introduced. Apart from the keyword used, <code>let</code> statements are written the same way <code>var</code> statements are.</p> <pre data-language="ts">let hello = "Hello!";</pre> <p>The key difference is not in the syntax, but in the semantics, which we’ll now dive into.</p> <h3 id="block-scoping" style="position:relative;">Block-scoping</h3> <p>When a variable is declared using <code>let</code>, it uses what some call <em>lexical-scoping</em> or <em>block-scoping</em>. Unlike variables declared with <code>var</code> whose scopes leak out to their containing function, block-scoped variables are not visible outside of their nearest containing block or <code>for</code>-loop.</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f(input: boolean) {
  let a = 100;

  if (input) {
    // Still okay to reference 'a'
    let b = a + 1;
    return b;
  }

  // Error: 'b' doesn't exist here
  return b;
}</pre> <p>Here, we have two local variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. <code>a</code>’s scope is limited to the body of <code>f</code> while <code>b</code>’s scope is limited to the containing <code>if</code> statement’s block.</p> <p>Variables declared in a <code>catch</code> clause also have similar scoping rules.</p> <pre data-language="ts">try {
  throw "oh no!";
} catch (e) {
  console.log("Oh well.");
}

// Error: 'e' doesn't exist here
console.log(e);</pre> <p>Another property of block-scoped variables is that they can’t be read or written to before they’re actually declared. While these variables are “present” throughout their scope, all points up until their declaration are part of their <em>temporal dead zone</em>. This is just a sophisticated way of saying you can’t access them before the <code>let</code> statement, and luckily TypeScript will let you know that.</p> <pre data-language="ts">a++; // illegal to use 'a' before it's declared;
let a;</pre> <p>Something to note is that you can still <em>capture</em> a block-scoped variable before it’s declared. The only catch is that it’s illegal to call that function before the declaration. If targeting ES2015, a modern runtime will throw an error; however, right now TypeScript is permissive and won’t report this as an error.</p> <pre data-language="ts">function foo() {
  // okay to capture 'a'
  return a;
}

// illegal call 'foo' before 'a' is declared
// runtimes should throw an error here
foo();

let a;</pre> <p>For more information on temporal dead zones, see relevant content on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#Temporal_dead_zone_and_errors_with_let">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.</p> <h3 id="re-declarations-and-shadowing" style="position:relative;">Re-declarations and Shadowing</h3> <p>With <code>var</code> declarations, we mentioned that it didn’t matter how many times you declared your variables; you just got one.</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f(x) {
  var x;
  var x;

  if (true) {
    var x;
  }
}</pre> <p>In the above example, all declarations of <code>x</code> actually refer to the <em>same</em> <code>x</code>, and this is perfectly valid. This often ends up being a source of bugs. Thankfully, <code>let</code> declarations are not as forgiving.</p> <pre data-language="ts">let x = 10;
let x = 20; // error: can't re-declare 'x' in the same scope</pre> <p>The variables don’t necessarily need to both be block-scoped for TypeScript to tell us that there’s a problem.</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f(x) {
  let x = 100; // error: interferes with parameter declaration
}

function g() {
  let x = 100;
  var x = 100; // error: can't have both declarations of 'x'
}</pre> <p>That’s not to say that a block-scoped variable can never be declared with a function-scoped variable. The block-scoped variable just needs to be declared within a distinctly different block.</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f(condition, x) {
  if (condition) {
    let x = 100;
    return x;
  }

  return x;
}

f(false, 0); // returns '0'
f(true, 0); // returns '100'</pre> <p>The act of introducing a new name in a more nested scope is called <em>shadowing</em>. It is a bit of a double-edged sword in that it can introduce certain bugs on its own in the event of accidental shadowing, while also preventing certain bugs. For instance, imagine we had written our earlier <code>sumMatrix</code> function using <code>let</code> variables.</p> <pre data-language="ts">function sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; matrix.length; i++) {
    var currentRow = matrix[i];
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; currentRow.length; i++) {
      sum += currentRow[i];
    }
  }

  return sum;
}</pre> <p>This version of the loop will actually perform the summation correctly because the inner loop’s <code>i</code> shadows <code>i</code> from the outer loop.</p> <p>Shadowing should <em>usually</em> be avoided in the interest of writing clearer code. While there are some scenarios where it may be fitting to take advantage of it, you should use your best judgement.</p> <h3 id="block-scoped-variable-capturing" style="position:relative;">Block-scoped variable capturing</h3> <p>When we first touched on the idea of variable capturing with <code>var</code> declaration, we briefly went into how variables act once captured. To give a better intuition of this, each time a scope is run, it creates an “environment” of variables. That environment and its captured variables can exist even after everything within its scope has finished executing.</p> <pre data-language="ts">function theCityThatAlwaysSleeps() {
  let getCity;

  if (true) {
    let city = "Seattle";
    getCity = function () {
      return city;
    };
  }

  return getCity();
}</pre> <p>Because we’ve captured <code>city</code> from within its environment, we’re still able to access it despite the fact that the <code>if</code> block finished executing.</p> <p>Recall that with our earlier <code>setTimeout</code> example, we ended up needing to use an IIFE to capture the state of a variable for every iteration of the <code>for</code> loop. In effect, what we were doing was creating a new variable environment for our captured variables. That was a bit of a pain, but luckily, you’ll never have to do that again in TypeScript.</p> <p><code>let</code> declarations have drastically different behavior when declared as part of a loop. Rather than just introducing a new environment to the loop itself, these declarations sort of create a new scope <em>per iteration</em>. Since this is what we were doing anyway with our IIFE, we can change our old <code>setTimeout</code> example to just use a <code>let</code> declaration.</p> <pre data-language="ts">for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, 100 * i);
}</pre> <p>and as expected, this will print out</p> <pre data-language="typescript">0

<code>const</code> declarations</h2> <p><code>const</code> declarations are another way of declaring variables.</p> <pre data-language="ts">const numLivesForCat = 9;</pre> <p>They are like <code>let</code> declarations but, as their name implies, their value cannot be changed once they are bound. In other words, they have the same scoping rules as <code>let</code>, but you can’t re-assign to them.</p> <p>This should not be confused with the idea that the values they refer to are <em>immutable</em>.</p> <pre data-language="ts">const numLivesForCat = 9;
const kitty = {
  name: "Aurora",
  numLives: numLivesForCat,
};

// Error
kitty = {
  name: "Danielle",
  numLives: numLivesForCat,
};

// all "okay"
kitty.name = "Rory";
kitty.name = "Kitty";
kitty.name = "Cat";
kitty.numLives--;</pre> <p>Unless you take specific measures to avoid it, the internal state of a <code>const</code> variable is still modifiable. Fortunately, TypeScript allows you to specify that members of an object are <code>readonly</code>. The <a href="interfaces.html">chapter on Interfaces</a> has the details.</p> <h2 id="let-vs-const" style="position:relative;">
<code>let</code> vs. <code>const</code>
</h2> <p>Given that we have two types of declarations with similar scoping semantics, it’s natural to find ourselves asking which one to use. Like most broad questions, the answer is: it depends.</p> <p>Applying the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a>, all declarations other than those you plan to modify should use <code>const</code>. The rationale is that if a variable didn’t need to get written to, others working on the same codebase shouldn’t automatically be able to write to the object, and will need to consider whether they really need to reassign to the variable. Using <code>const</code> also makes code more predictable when reasoning about flow of data.</p> <p>Use your best judgement, and if applicable, consult the matter with the rest of your team.</p> <p>The majority of this handbook uses <code>let</code> declarations.</p> <h2 id="destructuring" style="position:relative;">Destructuring</h2> <p>Another ECMAScript 2015 feature that TypeScript has is destructuring. For a complete reference, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">the article on the Mozilla Developer Network</a>. In this section, we’ll give a short overview.</p> <h3 id="array-destructuring" style="position:relative;">Array destructuring</h3> <p>The simplest form of destructuring is array destructuring assignment:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let input = [1, 2];
let [first, second] = input;
console.log(first); // outputs 1
console.log(second); // outputs 2</pre> <p>This creates two new variables named <code>first</code> and <code>second</code>. This is equivalent to using indexing, but is much more convenient:</p> <pre data-language="ts">first = input[0];
second = input[1];</pre> <p>Destructuring works with already-declared variables as well:</p> <pre data-language="ts">// swap variables
[first, second] = [second, first];</pre> <p>And with parameters to a function:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f([first, second]: [number, number]) {
  console.log(first);
  console.log(second);
}
f([1, 2]);</pre> <p>You can create a variable for the remaining items in a list using the syntax <code>...</code>:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(first); // outputs 1
console.log(rest); // outputs [ 2, 3, 4 ]</pre> <p>Of course, since this is JavaScript, you can just ignore trailing elements you don’t care about:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let [first] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(first); // outputs 1</pre> <p>Or other elements:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let [, second, , fourth] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(second); // outputs 2
console.log(fourth); // outputs 4</pre> <h3 id="tuple-destructuring" style="position:relative;">Tuple destructuring</h3> <p>Tuples may be destructured like arrays; the destructuring variables get the types of the corresponding tuple elements:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let tuple: [number, string, boolean] = [7, "hello", true];

let [a, b, c] = tuple; // a: number, b: string, c: boolean</pre> <p>It’s an error to destructure a tuple beyond the range of its elements:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let [a, b, c, d] = tuple; // Error, no element at index 3</pre> <p>As with arrays, you can destructure the rest of the tuple with <code>...</code>, to get a shorter tuple:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let [a, ...bc] = tuple; // bc: [string, boolean]
let [a, b, c, ...d] = tuple; // d: [], the empty tuple</pre> <p>Or ignore trailing elements, or other elements:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let [a] = tuple; // a: number
let [, b] = tuple; // b: string</pre> <h3 id="object-destructuring" style="position:relative;">Object destructuring</h3> <p>You can also destructure objects:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let o = {
  a: "foo",
  b: 12,
  c: "bar",
};
let { a, b } = o;</pre> <p>This creates new variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> from <code>o.a</code> and <code>o.b</code>. Notice that you can skip <code>c</code> if you don’t need it.</p> <p>Like array destructuring, you can have assignment without declaration:</p> <pre data-language="ts">({ a, b } = { a: "baz", b: 101 });</pre> <p>Notice that we had to surround this statement with parentheses. JavaScript normally parses a <code>{</code> as the start of block.</p> <p>You can create a variable for the remaining items in an object using the syntax <code>...</code>:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let { a, ...passthrough } = o;
let total = passthrough.b + passthrough.c.length;</pre> <h4 id="property-renaming" style="position:relative;">Property renaming</h4> <p>You can also give different names to properties:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let { a: newName1, b: newName2 } = o;</pre> <p>Here the syntax starts to get confusing. You can read <code>a: newName1</code> as ”<code>a</code> as <code>newName1</code>”. The direction is left-to-right, as if you had written:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let newName1 = o.a;
let newName2 = o.b;</pre> <p>Confusingly, the colon here does <em>not</em> indicate the type. The type, if you specify it, still needs to be written after the entire destructuring:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let { a: newName1, b: newName2 }: { a: string; b: number } = o;</pre> <h4 id="default-values" style="position:relative;">Default values</h4> <p>Default values let you specify a default value in case a property is undefined:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function keepWholeObject(wholeObject: { a: string; b?: number }) {
  let { a, b = 1001 } = wholeObject;
}</pre> <p>In this example the <code>b?</code> indicates that <code>b</code> is optional, so it may be <code>undefined</code>. <code>keepWholeObject</code> now has a variable for <code>wholeObject</code> as well as the properties <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, even if <code>b</code> is undefined.</p> <h2 id="function-declarations" style="position:relative;">Function declarations</h2> <p>Destructuring also works in function declarations. For simple cases this is straightforward:</p> <pre data-language="ts">type C = { a: string; b?: number };
function f({ a, b }: C): void {
  // ...
}</pre> <p>But specifying defaults is more common for parameters, and getting defaults right with destructuring can be tricky. First of all, you need to remember to put the pattern before the default value.</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f({ a = "", b = 0 } = {}): void {
  // ...
}
f();</pre> <blockquote> <p>The snippet above is an example of type inference, explained earlier in the handbook.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, you need to remember to give a default for optional properties on the destructured property instead of the main initializer. Remember that <code>C</code> was defined with <code>b</code> optional:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f({ a, b = 0 } = { a: "" }): void {
  // ...
}
f({ a: "yes" }); // ok, default b = 0
f(); // ok, default to { a: "" }, which then defaults b = 0
f({}); // error, 'a' is required if you supply an argument</pre> <p>Use destructuring with care. As the previous example demonstrates, anything but the simplest destructuring expression is confusing. This is especially true with deeply nested destructuring, which gets <em>really</em> hard to understand even without piling on renaming, default values, and type annotations. Try to keep destructuring expressions small and simple. You can always write the assignments that destructuring would generate yourself.</p> <h2 id="spread" style="position:relative;">Spread</h2> <p>The spread operator is the opposite of destructuring. It allows you to spread an array into another array, or an object into another object. For example:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let first = [1, 2];
let second = [3, 4];
let bothPlus = [0, ...first, ...second, 5];</pre> <p>This gives bothPlus the value <code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>. Spreading creates a shallow copy of <code>first</code> and <code>second</code>. They are not changed by the spread.</p> <p>You can also spread objects:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let defaults = { food: "spicy", price: "$$", ambiance: "noisy" };
let search = { ...defaults, food: "rich" };</pre> <p>Now <code>search</code> is <code>{ food: "rich", price: "$$", ambiance: "noisy" }</code>. Object spreading is more complex than array spreading. Like array spreading, it proceeds from left-to-right, but the result is still an object. This means that properties that come later in the spread object overwrite properties that come earlier. So if we modify the previous example to spread at the end:</p> <pre data-language="ts">let defaults = { food: "spicy", price: "$$", ambiance: "noisy" };
let search = { food: "rich", ...defaults };</pre> <p>Then the <code>food</code> property in <code>defaults</code> overwrites <code>food: "rich"</code>, which is not what we want in this case.</p> <p>Object spread also has a couple of other surprising limits. First, it only includes an objects’ <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties">own, enumerable properties</a>. Basically, that means you lose methods when you spread instances of an object:</p> <pre data-language="ts">class C {
  p = 12;
  m() {}
}
let c = new C();
let clone = { ...c };
clone.p; // ok
clone.m(); // error!</pre> <p>Second, the TypeScript compiler doesn’t allow spreads of type parameters from generic functions. That feature is expected in future versions of the language.</p> <h2 id="using-declarations" style="position:relative;">
<code>using</code> declarations</h2> <p><code>using</code> declarations are an upcoming feature for JavaScript that are part of the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management">Stage 3 Explicit Resource Management</a> proposal. A <code>using</code> declaration is much like a <code>const</code> declaration, except that it couples the <em>lifetime</em> of the value bound to the declaration with the <em>scope</em> of the variable.</p> <p>When control exits the block containing a <code>using</code> declaration, the <code>[Symbol.dispose]()</code> method of the declared value is executed, which allows that value to perform cleanup:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f() {
  using x = new C();
  doSomethingWith(x);
} // `x[Symbol.dispose]()` is called</pre> <p>At runtime, this has an effect <em>roughly</em> equivalent to the following:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f() {
  const x = new C();
  try {
    doSomethingWith(x);
  }
  finally {
    x[Symbol.dispose]();
  }
}</pre> <p><code>using</code> declarations are extremely useful for avoiding memory leaks when working with JavaScript objects that hold on to native references like file handles</p> <pre data-language="ts">{
  using file = await openFile();
  file.write(text);
  doSomethingThatMayThrow();
} // `file` is disposed, even if an error is thrown</pre> <p>or scoped operations like tracing</p> <pre data-language="ts">function f() {
  using activity = new TraceActivity("f"); // traces entry into function
  // ...
} // traces exit of function
</pre> <p>Unlike <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>, <code>using</code> declarations do not support destructuring.</p> <h3 id="null-and-undefined" style="position:relative;">
<code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>
</h3> <p>It’s important to note that the value can be <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, in which case nothing is disposed at the end of the block:</p> <pre data-language="ts">{
  using x = b ? new C() : null;
  // ...
}</pre> <p>which is <em>roughly</em> equivalent to:</p> <pre data-language="ts">{
  const x = b ? new C() : null;
  try {
    // ...
  }
  finally {
    x?.[Symbol.dispose]();
  }
}</pre> <p>This allows you to conditionally acquire resources when declaring a <code>using</code> declaration without the need for complex branching or repetition.</p> <h3 id="defining-a-disposable-resource" style="position:relative;">Defining a disposable resource</h3> <p>You can indicate the classes or objects you produce are disposable by implementing the <code>Disposable</code> interface:</p> <pre data-language="ts">// from the default lib:
interface Disposable {
  [Symbol.dispose](): void;
}

// usage:
class TraceActivity implements Disposable {
  readonly name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
    console.log(`Entering: ${name}`);
  }

  [Symbol.dispose](): void {
    console.log(`Exiting: ${name}`);
  }
}

function f() {
  using _activity = new TraceActivity("f");
  console.log("Hello world!");
}

f();
// prints:
//   Entering: f
//   Hello world!
//   Exiting: f</pre> <h2 id="await-using-declarations" style="position:relative;">
<code>await using</code> declarations</h2> <p>Some resources or operations may have cleanup that needs to be performed asynchronously. To accommodate this, the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management">Explicit Resource Management</a> proposal also introduces the <code>await using</code> declaration:</p> <pre data-language="ts">async function f() {
  await using x = new C();
} // `await x[Symbol.asyncDispose]()` is invoked</pre> <p>An <code>await using</code> declaration invokes, and <em>awaits</em>, its value’s <code>[Symbol.asyncDispose]()</code> method as control leaves the containing block. This allows for asynchronous cleanup, such as a database transaction performing a rollback or commit, or a file stream flushing any pending writes to storage before it is closed.</p> <p>As with <code>await</code>, <code>await using</code> can only be used in an <code>async</code> function or method, or at the top level of a module.</p> <h3 id="defining-an-asynchronously-disposable-resource" style="position:relative;">Defining an asynchronously disposable resource</h3> <p>Just as <code>using</code> relies on objects that are <code>Disposable</code>, an <code>await using</code> relies on objects that are <code>AsyncDisposable</code>:</p> <pre data-language="ts">// from the default lib:
interface AsyncDisposable {
  [Symbol.asyncDispose]: PromiseLike&lt;void&gt;;
}

// usage:
class DatabaseTransaction implements AsyncDisposable {
  public success = false;
  private db: Database | undefined;

  private constructor(db: Database) {
    this.db = db;
  }

  static async create(db: Database) {
    await db.execAsync("BEGIN TRANSACTION");
    return new DatabaseTransaction(db);
  }

  async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {
    if (this.db) {
      const db = this.db:
      this.db = undefined;
      if (this.success) {
        await db.execAsync("COMMIT TRANSACTION");
      }
      else {
        await db.execAsync("ROLLBACK TRANSACTION");
      }
    }
  }
}

async function transfer(db: Database, account1: Account, account2: Account, amount: number) {
  using tx = await DatabaseTransaction.create(db);
  if (await debitAccount(db, account1, amount)) {
    await creditAccount(db, account2, amount);
  }
  // if an exception is thrown before this line, the transaction will roll back
  tx.success = true;
  // now the transaction will commit

<code>await using</code> vs <code>await</code>
</h3> <p>The <code>await</code> keyword that is part of the <code>await using</code> declaration only indicates that the <em>disposal</em> of the resource is <code>await</code>-ed. It does <em>not</em> <code>await</code> the value itself:</p> <pre data-language="ts">{
  await using x = getResourceSynchronously();
} // performs `await x[Symbol.asyncDispose]()`

{
  await using y = await getResourceAsynchronously();
} // performs `await y[Symbol.asyncDispose]()`</pre> <h3 id="await-using-and-return" style="position:relative;">
<code>await using</code> and <code>return</code>
</h3> <p>It’s important to note that there is a small caveat with this behavior if you are using an <code>await using</code> declaration in an <code>async</code> function that returns a <code>Promise</code> without first <code>await</code>-ing it:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function g() {
  return Promise.reject("error!");
}

async function f() {
  await using x = new C();
  return g(); // missing an `await`
}</pre> <p>Because the returned promise isn’t <code>await</code>-ed, it’s possible that the JavaScript runtime may report an unhandled rejection since execution pauses while <code>await</code>-ing the asynchronous disposal of <code>x</code>, without having subscribed to the returned promise. This is not a problem that is unique to <code>await using</code>, however, as this can also occur in an <code>async</code> function that uses <code>try..finally</code>:</p> <pre data-language="ts">async function f() {
  try {
    return g(); // also reports an unhandled rejection
  }
  finally {
    await somethingElse();
  }
}</pre> <p>To avoid this situation, it is recommended that you <code>await</code> your return value if it may be a <code>Promise</code>:</p> <pre data-language="ts">async function f() {
  await using x = new C();
  return await g();
}</pre> <h2 id="using-and-await-using-in-for-and-forof-statements" style="position:relative;">
<code>using</code> and <code>await using</code> in <code>for</code> and <code>for..of</code> statements</h2> <p>Both <code>using</code> and <code>await using</code> can be used in a <code>for</code> statement:</p> <pre data-language="ts">for (using x = getReader(); !x.eof; x.next()) {
  // ...
}</pre> <p>In this case, the lifetime of <code>x</code> is scoped to the entire <code>for</code> statement and is only disposed when control leaves the loop due to <code>break</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>throw</code>, or when the loop condition is false.</p> <p>In addition to <code>for</code> statements, both declarations can also be used in <code>for..of</code> statements:</p> <pre data-language="ts">function * g() {
  yield createResource1();
  yield createResource2();
}

for (using x of g()) {
  // ...
}</pre> <p>Here, <code>x</code> is disposed at the end of <em>each iteration of the loop</em>, and is then reinitialized with the next value. This is especially useful when consuming resources produced one at a time by a generator.</p> <h2 id="using-and-await-using-in-older-runtimes" style="position:relative;">
<code>using</code> and <code>await using</code> in older runtimes</h2> <p><code>using</code> and <code>await using</code> declarations can be used when targeting older ECMAScript editions as long as you are using a compatible polyfill for <code>Symbol.dispose</code>/<code>Symbol.asyncDispose</code>, such as the one provided by default in recent editions of NodeJS.</p><div class="_attribution">
