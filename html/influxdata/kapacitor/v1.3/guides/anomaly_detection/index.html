<h1>Custom Anomaly Detection</h1>     <p>Everyone has their own anomaly detection algorithm, so we have built Kapacitor to integrate easily with which ever algorithm fits your domain. Kapacitor calls these custom algorithms UDFs for User Defined Functions. This guide will walk through the necessary steps for writing and using your own UDFs within Kapacitor.</p> <p>If you haven’t already, we recommend following the <a href="../../introduction/getting_started/index.html">getting started guide</a> for Kapacitor prior to continuing.</p> <h2 id="3d-printing">3D Printing</h2> <p>If you own or have recently purchased a 3D printer, you may know that 3D printing requires the environment to be at certain temperatures in order to ensure quality prints. Prints can also take a long time (some can take more than 24 hours), so you can’t just watch the temperature graphs the whole time to make sure the print is going well. Also, if a print goes bad early, you want to make sure and stop it so that you can restart it, and not waste materials on continuing a bad print.</p> <p>Due to the physical limitations of 3D printing, the printer software is typically designed to keep the temperatures within certain tolerances. For the sake of argument, let’s say that you don’t trust the software to do it’s job (or want to create your own), and want to be alerted when the temperature reaches an abnormal level.</p> <p>There are three temperatures when it comes to 3D printing:</p> <ol> <li>The temperature of the hot end (where the plastic is melted before being printed).</li> <li>The temperature of the bed (where the part is being printed).</li> <li>The temperature of the ambient air (the air around the printer).</li> </ol> <p>All three of these temperatures affect the quality of the print (some being more important than others), but we want to make sure and track all of them.</p> <p>To keep our anomaly detection algorithm simple, let’s compute a <code>p-value</code> for each window of data we receive, and then emit a single data point with that <code>p-value</code>. To compute the <code>p-value</code>, we will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t_test">Welch’s t-test</a>. For a null hypothesis, we will state that a new window is from the same population as the historical windows. If the <code>p-value</code> drops low enough, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the window must be from something different than the historical data population, or <em>an anomaly</em>. This is an oversimplified approach, but we are learning how to write UDFs, not statistics.</p> <h2 id="writing-a-udf">Writing a UDF</h2> <p>Now that we have an idea of what we want to do, let’s understand how Kapacitor wants to communicate with our process. From the <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/tree/master/udf/agent">UDF README</a> we learn that Kapacitor will spawn a process called an <code>agent</code>. The <code>agent</code> is responsible for describing what options it has, and then initializing itself with a set of options. As data is received by the UDF, the <code>agent</code> performs its computation and then returns the resulting data to Kapacitor. All of this communication occurs over STDIN and STDOUT using protocol buffers. As of this writing, Kapacitor has agents implemented in Go and Python that take care of the communication details and expose an interface for doing the actual work. For this guide, we will be using the Python agent.</p> <h3 id="the-handler-interface">The Handler Interface</h3> <p>Here is the Python handler interface for the agent:</p> <pre data-language="python"># The Agent calls the appropriate methods on the Handler as requests are read off STDIN.
#
# Throwing an exception will cause the Agent to stop and an ErrorResponse to be sent.
# Some *Response objects (like SnapshotResponse) allow for returning their own error within the object itself.
# These types of errors will not stop the Agent and Kapacitor will deal with them appropriately.
#
# The Handler is called from a single thread, meaning methods will not be called concurrently.
#
# To write Points/Batches back to the Agent/Kapacitor use the Agent.write_response method, which is thread safe.
class Handler(object):
    def info(self):
        pass
    def init(self, init_req):

    def snapshot(self):

    def restore(self, restore_req):

    def point(self):
        pass
    def end_batch(self, end_req):
        pass
</pre> <h3 id="the-info-method">The Info Method</h3> <p>Let’s start with the <code>info</code> method. When Kapacitor starts up it will call <code>info</code> and expect in return some information about how this UDF behaves. Specifically, Kapacitor expects the kind of edge the UDF wants and provides.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Remember</strong>: within Kapacitor, data is transported in streams or batches, so the UDF must declare what it expects.</p> </blockquote> <p>In addition, UDFs can accept certain options so that they are individually configurable. The <code>info</code> response can contain a list of options, their names, and expected arguments.</p> <p>For our example UDF, we need to know three things:</p> <ol> <li>The field to operate on.</li> <li>The size of the historical window to keep.</li> <li>The significance level or <code>alpha</code> being used.</li> </ol> <p>Below we have the implementation of the <code>info</code> method for our handler that defines the edge types and options available:</p> <pre data-language="python">...
    def info(self):
        """
        Respond with which type of edges we want/provide and any options we have.
        """
        response = udf_pb2.Response()

        # We will consume batch edges aka windows of data.
        response.info.wants = udf_pb2.BATCH
        # We will produce single points of data aka stream.
        response.info.provides = udf_pb2.STREAM

        # Here we can define options for the UDF.
        # Define which field we should process.
        response.info.options['field'].valueTypes.append(udf_pb2.STRING)

        # Since we will be computing a moving average let's make the size configurable.
        # Define an option 'size' that takes one integer argument.
        response.info.options['size'].valueTypes.append(udf_pb2.INT)

        # We need to know the alpha level so that we can ignore bad windows.

        response.info.options['alpha'].valueTypes.append(udf_pb2.DOUBLE)

        return response
...
</pre> <p>When Kapacitor starts, it will spawn our UDF process and request the <code>info</code> data and then shutdown the process. Kapacitor will remember this information for each UDF. This way, Kapacitor can understand the available options for a given UDF before its executed inside of a task.</p> <h3 id="the-init-method">The Init Method</h3> <p>Next let’s implement the <code>init</code> method, which is called once the task starts executing. The <code>init</code> method receives a list of chosen options, which are then used to configure the handler appropriately. In response, we indicate whether the <code>init</code> request was successful, and, if not, any error messages if the options were invalid.</p> <pre data-language="python">...

</pre> <p>When a task starts, Kapacitor spawns a new process for the UDF and calls <code>init</code>, passing any specified options from the TICKscript. Once initialized, the process will remain running and Kapacitor will begin sending data as it arrives.</p> <h3 id="the-batch-and-point-methods">The Batch and Point Methods</h3> <p>Our task wants a <code>batch</code> edge, meaning it expects to get data in batches or windows. To send a batch of data to the UDF process, Kapacitor first calls the <code>begin_batch</code> method, which indicates that all subsequent points belong to a batch. Once the batch is complete, the <code>end_batch</code> method is called with some metadata about the batch.</p> <p>At a high level, this is what our UDF code will do for each of the <code>begin_batch</code>, <code>point</code>, and <code>end_batch</code> calls:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>begin_batch</code> – mark the start of a new batch and initialize a structure for it</li> <li>

</pre> <p>Save the above script as <code>/tmp/kapacitor_udf/printer_data.py</code>.</p> <blockquote> <p>This Python script has two Python dependencies: <code>requests</code> and <code>numpy</code>. They can easily be installed via <code>pip</code> or your package manager.</p> </blockquote> <p>At this point we have a task ready to go, and a script to generate some fake data with anomalies. Now we can create a recording of our fake data so that we can easily iterate on the task:</p> <pre data-language="sh"># Start the recording in the background
kapacitor record stream -task print_temps -duration 24h -no-wait
# Grab the ID from the output and store it in a var
rid=7bd3ced5-5e95-4a67-a0e1-f00860b1af47
# Run our python script to generate data
chmod +x ./printer_data.py
./printer_data.py
</pre> <p>We can verify it worked by listing information about the recording. Our recording came out to <code>1.6MB</code>, so yours should come out somewhere close to that:</p> <pre>$ kapacitor list recordings $rid
ID                                      Type    Status    Size      Date
7bd3ced5-5e95-4a67-a0e1-f00860b1af47    stream  finished  1.6 MB    04 May 16 11:44 MDT
</pre> <h3 id="detecting-anomalies">Detecting Anomalies</h3> <p>Finally, let’s run the play against our task and see how it works:</p> <pre>kapacitor replay -task print_temps -recording $rid -rec-time
</pre> <p>Check the various log files to see if the algorithm caught the anomalies:</p> <pre>cat /tmp/kapacitor_udf/{hotend,bed,air}_failure.log
</pre> <p>Based on the <code>printer_data.py</code> script above, there should be anomalies at:</p> <ul> <li>1hr – hotend</li> <li>8hr – bed</li> <li>12hr – air</li> </ul> <p>There may be some false positives as well, but, since we want this to work with real data (not our nice clean fake data), it doesn’t help much to tweak it at this point.</p> <p>Well, there we have it. We can now get alerts when the temperatures for our prints deviates from the norm. Hopefully you now have a better understanding of how Kapacitor UDFs work, and have a good working example as a launching point into further work with UDFS.</p> <p>The framework is in place, now go plug in a real anomaly detection algorithm that works for your domain!</p> <h2 id="extending-this-example">Extending This Example</h2> <p>There are a few things that we have left as exercises to the reader:</p> <ol> <li><p>Snapshot/Restore – Kapacitor will regularly snapshot the state of your UDF process so that it can be restored if the process is restarted. The examples <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/tree/master/udf/agent/examples/">here</a> have implementations for the <code>snapshot</code> and <code>restore</code> methods. Implement them for the <code>TTestHandler</code> handler as an exercise.</p></li> <li><p>Change the algorithm from a t-test to something more fitting for your domain. Both <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> have a wealth of algorithms.</p></li> <li><p>The options returned by the <code>info</code> request can contain multiple arguments. Modify the <code>field</code> option to accept three field names and change the <code>TTestHandler</code> to maintain historical data and batches for each field instead of just the one. That way only one ttest.py process needs to be running.</p></li> </ol><div class="_attribution">
