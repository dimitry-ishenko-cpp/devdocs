<h1>Design Insights and Tradeoffs in InfluxDB</h1>     <p>InfluxDB is a time-series database. Optimizing for this use-case entails some tradeoffs, primarily to increase performance at the cost of functionality. Below is a list of some of those design insights that lead to tradeoffs:</p> <ol> <li>For the time series use case, we assume that if the same data is sent multiple times, it is the exact same data that a client just sent several times. <ul> <li>
<em>Pro:</em> Simplified <a href="../../troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/index.html#how-does-influxdb-handle-duplicate-points">conflict resolution</a> increases write performance</li> <li>
<em>Con:</em> Cannot store duplicate data; may overwrite data in rare circumstances</li> </ul>
</li> <li>Deletes are a rare occurrence. When they do occur it is almost always against large ranges of old data that are cold for writes. <ul> <li>
<em>Pro:</em> Restricting access to deletes allows for increased query and write performance</li> <li>
<em>Con:</em> Delete functionality is significantly restricted</li> </ul>
</li> <li>Updates to existing data are a rare occurrence and contentious updates never happen. Time series data is predominantly new data that is never updated. <ul> <li>
<em>Pro:</em> Restricting access to updates allows for increased query and write performance</li> <li>
<em>Con:</em> Update functionality is significantly restricted</li> </ul>
</li> <li>The vast majority of writes are for data with very recent timestamps and the data is added in time ascending order. <ul> <li>
<em>Pro:</em> Adding data in time ascending order is significantly more performant</li> <li>
<em>Con:</em> Writing points with random times or with time not in ascending order is significantly less performant</li> </ul>
</li> <li>Scale is critical. The database must be able to handle a <em>high</em> volume of reads and writes. <ul> <li>
<em>Pro:</em> The database can handle a <em>high</em> volume of reads and writes</li> <li>
<em>Con:</em> The InfluxDB development team was forced to make tradeoffs to increase performance</li> </ul>
</li> <li>Being able to write and query the data is more important than having a strongly consistent view. <ul> <li>
<em>Pro:</em> Writing and querying the database can be done by multiple clients and at high loads</li> <li>
<em>Con:</em> Query returns may not include the most recent points if database is under heavy load</li> </ul>
</li> <li>Many time <a href="../glossary/index.html#series">series</a> are ephemeral. There are often time series that appear only for a few hours and then go away, e.g. a new host that gets started and reports for a while and then gets shut down. <ul> <li>
<em>Pro:</em> InfluxDB is good at managing discontinuous data</li> <li>
<em>Con:</em> Schema-less design means that some database functions are not supported e.g. there are no cross table joins</li> </ul>
</li> <li>No one point is too important. <ul> <li>
<em>Pro:</em> InfluxDB has very powerful tools to deal with aggregate data and large data sets</li> <li>
<em>Con:</em> Points donâ€™t have IDs in the traditional sense, they are differentiated by timestamp and series</li> </ul>
