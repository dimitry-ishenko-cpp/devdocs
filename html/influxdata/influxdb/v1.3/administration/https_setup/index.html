<h1>HTTPS Setup</h1>     <p>This guide describes how to enable HTTPS with InfluxDB. Setting up HTTPS secures the communication between clients and the InfluxDB server, and, in some cases, HTTPS verifies the authenticity of the InfluxDB server to clients.</p> <p>If you plan on sending requests to InfluxDB over a network, we <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.3/administration/security_best_practices/">strongly recommend</a> that you set up HTTPS.</p> <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2> <p>To set up HTTPS with InfluxDB, you’ll need an existing or new InfluxDB instance and a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate (also known as a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate). InfluxDB supports three types of TLS/SSL certificates:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><strong>Single domain certificates signed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Certificate Authority</a></strong></p> <p>These certificates provide cryptographic security to HTTPS requests and allow clients to verify the identity of the InfluxDB server. With this certificate option, every InfluxDB instance requires a unique single domain certificate.</p>
</li> <li>
<p><strong>Wildcard certificates signed by a Certificate Authority</strong></p> <p>These certificates provide cryptographic security to HTTPS requests and allow clients to verify the identity of the InfluxDB server. Wildcard certificates can be used across multiple InfluxDB instances on different servers.</p>
</li> <li>
<p><strong>Self-signed certificates</strong></p> <p>Self-signed certificates are not signed by a CA and you can <a href="#step-1-generate-a-self-signed-certificate">generate</a> them on your own machine. Unlike CA-signed certificates, self-signed certificates only provide cryptographic security to HTTPS requests. They do not allow clients to verify the identity of the InfluxDB server. We recommend using a self-signed certificate if you are unable to obtain a CA-signed certificate. With this certificate option, every InfluxDB instance requires a unique self-signed certificate.</p>
</li> </ul> <p>Regardless of your certificate’s type, InfluxDB supports certificates composed of a private key file (<code>.key</code>) and a signed certificate file (<code>.crt</code>) file pair, as well as certificates that combine the private key file and the signed certificate file into a single bundled file (<code>.pem</code>).</p> <p>The following two sections outline how to set up HTTPS with InfluxDB <a href="#setup-https-with-a-ca-signed-certificate">using a CA-signed certificate</a> and <a href="#setup-https-with-a-self-signed-certificate">using a self-signed certificate</a> on Ubuntu 16.04. Specific steps may be different for other operating systems.</p> <h2 id="setup-https-with-a-ca-signed-certificate">Setup HTTPS with a CA-Signed Certificate</h2> <h4 id="step-1-install-the-ssl-tls-certificate">Step 1: Install the SSL/TLS certificate</h4> <p>Place the private key file (<code>.key</code>) and the signed certificate file (<code>.crt</code>) or the single bundled file (<code>.pem</code>) in the <code>/etc/ssl</code> directory.</p> <h4 id="step-2-ensure-file-permissions">Step 2: Ensure file permissions</h4> <p>Certificate files require read and write access by the <code>root</code> user. Ensure that you have the correct file permissions by running the following commands:</p> <pre>sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/&lt;CA-certificate-file&gt;
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/&lt;CA-certificate-file&gt;
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/&lt;private-key-file&gt;
</pre> <h4 id="step-3-enable-https-in-influxdb-s-configuration-file">Step 3: Enable HTTPS in InfluxDB’s configuration file</h4> <p>HTTPS is disabled by default. Enable HTTPS in InfluxDB’s the <code>[http]</code> section of the configuration file (<code>/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf</code>) by setting:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>https-enabled</code> to <code>true</code>
</li> <li>
<code>http-certificate</code> to <code>/etc/ssl/&lt;signed-certificate-file&gt;.crt</code> (or to <code>/etc/ssl/&lt;bundled-certificate-file&gt;.pem</code>)</li> <li>
<code>http-private-key</code> to <code>/etc/ssl/&lt;private-key-file&gt;.key</code> (or to <code>/etc/ssl/&lt;bundled-certificate-file&gt;.pem</code>)</li> </ul> <pre>[http]

  [...]

  # Determines whether HTTPS is enabled.
  https-enabled = true

  [...]

  # The SSL certificate to use when HTTPS is enabled.
  https-certificate = "&lt;bundled-certificate-file&gt;.pem"

  # Use a separate private key location.
  https-private-key = "&lt;bundled-certificate-file&gt;.pem"
</pre> <h4 id="step-4-restart-influxdb">Step 4: Restart InfluxDB</h4> <p>Restart the InfluxDB process for the configuration changes to take effect:</p> <pre>sudo systemctl restart influxdb
</pre> <h4 id="step-5-verify-the-https-setup">Step 5: Verify the HTTPS Setup</h4> <p>Verify that HTTPS is working by connecting to InfluxDB with the <a href="../../tools/shell/index.html">CLI tool</a>:</p> <pre>influx -ssl -host &lt;domain_name&gt;.com
</pre> <p>A successful connection returns the following:</p> <pre>Connected to https://&lt;domain_name&gt;.com:8086 version 1.x.x
InfluxDB shell version: 1.x.x
&gt;
</pre> <p>That’s it!
