GCC consists of a collection of front ends for various languages, which translate the source code into a language-independent form called <em class="dfn">GENERIC</em>. This is then processed by a common middle end which provides optimization, and then passed to one of a collection of back ends which generate code for different computer architectures and operating systems. </p> <p>Functionally, this is implemented with a driver program (<code class="command">gcc</code>) which provides the command-line interface for the compiler. It calls the relevant compiler front-end program (e.g., <code class="command">f951</code> for Fortran) for each file in the source code, and then calls the assembler and linker as appropriate to produce the compiled output. In a copy of GCC that has been compiled with Fortran language support enabled, <code class="command">gcc</code> recognizes files with <samp class="file">.f</samp>, <samp class="file">.for</samp>, <samp class="file">.ftn</samp>, <samp class="file">.f90</samp>, <samp class="file">.f95</samp>, <samp class="file">.f03</samp> and <samp class="file">.f08</samp> extensions as Fortran source code, and compiles it accordingly. A <code class="command">gfortran</code> driver program is also provided, which is identical to <code class="command">gcc</code> except that it automatically links the Fortran runtime libraries into the compiled program. </p> <p>Source files with <samp class="file">.f</samp>, <samp class="file">.for</samp>, <samp class="file">.fpp</samp>, <samp class="file">.ftn</samp>, <samp class="file">.F</samp>, <samp class="file">.FOR</samp>, <samp class="file">.FPP</samp>, and <samp class="file">.FTN</samp> extensions are treated as fixed form. Source files with <samp class="file">.f90</samp>, <samp class="file">.f95</samp>, <samp class="file">.f03</samp>, <samp class="file">.f08</samp>, <samp class="file">.F90</samp>, <samp class="file">.F95</samp>, <samp class="file">.F03</samp> and <samp class="file">.F08</samp> extensions are treated as free form. The capitalized versions of either form are run through preprocessing. Source files with the lower case <samp class="file">.fpp</samp> extension are also run through preprocessing. </p> <p>This manual specifically documents the Fortran front end, which handles the programming language’s syntax and semantics. The aspects of GCC that relate to the optimization passes and the back-end code generation are documented in the GCC manual; see <a data-manual="gcc" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/index.html#Top">Introduction</a> in Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). The two manuals together provide a complete reference for the GNU Fortran compiler. </p> </div>  <div class="nav-panel"> <p> Next: <a href="standards.html">Standards</a>, Previous: <a href="about-gnu-fortran.html">About GNU Fortran</a>, Up: <a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a> [<a href="index.html#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-13.1.0/gfortran/Option-Index.html" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
