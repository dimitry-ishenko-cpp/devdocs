<span><code class="code">-fdump-fortran-global</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Output a list of the global identifiers after translating into middle-end representation. Mostly useful for debugging the GNU Fortran compiler itself. The output generated by this option might change between releases. This option may also generate internal compiler errors for features which have only recently been added. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-fdump-fortran-optimized</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Output the parse tree after front-end optimization. Mostly useful for debugging the GNU Fortran compiler itself. The output generated by this option might change between releases. This option may also generate internal compiler errors for features which have only recently been added. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-fdump-fortran-original</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Output the internal parse tree after translating the source program into internal representation. This option is mostly useful for debugging the GNU Fortran compiler itself. The output generated by this option might change between releases. This option may also generate internal compiler errors for features which have only recently been added. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-fdump-parse-tree</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Output the internal parse tree after translating the source program into internal representation. Mostly useful for debugging the GNU Fortran compiler itself. The output generated by this option might change between releases. This option may also generate internal compiler errors for features which have only recently been added. This option is deprecated; use <code class="code">-fdump-fortran-original</code> instead. </p> </dd> <dt><code class="code">-save-temps</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Store the usual “temporary” intermediate files permanently; name them as auxiliary output files, as specified described under GCC <samp class="option">-dumpbase</samp> and <samp class="option">-dumpdir</samp>. </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted">gfortran -save-temps -c foo.F90</pre>
</div> <p>preprocesses input file <samp class="file">foo.F90</samp> to <samp class="file">foo.fii</samp>, compiles to an intermediate <samp class="file">foo.s</samp>, and then assembles to the (implied) output file <samp class="file">foo.o</samp>, whereas: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted">gfortran -save-temps -S foo.F</pre>
</div> <p>saves the preprocessor output in <samp class="file">foo.fi</samp>, and then compiles to the (implied) output file <samp class="file">foo.s</samp>. </p> </dd> </dl> </div><div class="_attribution">
