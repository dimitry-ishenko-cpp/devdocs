<h1 class="section" id="Standards-1">1.3 Standards</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Standards">     <p>Fortran is developed by the Working Group 5 of Sub-Committee 22 of the Joint Technical Committee 1 of the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This group is known as <a class="uref" href="http://www.nag.co.uk/sc22wg5/">WG5</a>. Official Fortran standard documents are available for purchase from ISO; a collection of free documents (typically final drafts) are also available on the <a class="uref" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranStandards">wiki</a>. </p> <p>The GNU Fortran compiler implements ISO/IEC 1539:1997 (Fortran 95). As such, it can also compile essentially all standard-compliant Fortran 90 and Fortran 77 programs. It also supports the ISO/IEC TR-15581 enhancements to allocatable arrays. </p> <p>GNU Fortran also supports almost all of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004 (Fortran 2003) and ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 (Fortran 2008). It has partial support for features introduced in ISO/IEC 1539:2018 (Fortran 2018), the most recent version of the Fortran language standard, including full support for the Technical Specification <code class="code">Further Interoperability of Fortran with C</code> (ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012). More details on support for these standards can be found in the following sections of the documentation. </p> <p>Additionally, the GNU Fortran compilers supports the OpenMP specification (version 4.5 and partial support of the features of the 5.0 version, <a class="url" href="https://openmp.org/specifications/">https://openmp.org/specifications/</a>). There also is support for the OpenACC specification (targeting version 2.6, <a class="uref" href="https://www.openacc.org/">https://www.openacc.org/</a>). See <a class="uref" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/OpenACC">https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/OpenACC</a> for more information. </p> <ul class="mini-toc"> <li><a href="fortran-95-status.html" accesskey="1">Fortran 95 status</a></li> <li><a href="fortran-2003-status.html" accesskey="2">Fortran 2003 status</a></li> <li><a href="fortran-2008-status.html" accesskey="3">Fortran 2008 status</a></li> <li><a href="fortran-2018-status.html" accesskey="4">Fortran 2018 status</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
