<h1 class="subsection" id="OpenMP-1">5.1.18 OpenMP</h1> <div class="subsection-level-extent" id="OpenMP">     <p>OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an application programming interface (API) that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C/C++ and Fortran on many architectures, including Unix and Microsoft Windows platforms. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behavior. </p> <p>GNU Fortran strives to be compatible to the <a class="uref" href="https://openmp.org/specifications/">OpenMP Application Program Interface v4.5</a>. </p> <p>To enable the processing of the OpenMP directive <code class="code">!$omp</code> in free-form source code; the <code class="code">c$omp</code>, <code class="code">*$omp</code> and <code class="code">!$omp</code> directives in fixed form; the <code class="code">!$</code> conditional compilation sentinels in free form; and the <code class="code">c$</code>, <code class="code">*$</code> and <code class="code">!$</code> sentinels in fixed form, <code class="command">gfortran</code> needs to be invoked with the <samp class="option">-fopenmp</samp>. This also arranges for automatic linking of the GNU Offloading and Multi Processing Runtime Library <a data-manual="libgomp" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libgomp/index.html#Top">libgomp</a> in GNU Offloading and Multi Processing Runtime Library. </p> <p>The OpenMP Fortran runtime library routines are provided both in a form of a Fortran 90 module named <code class="code">omp_lib</code> and in a form of a Fortran <code class="code">include</code> file named <samp class="file">omp_lib.h</samp>. </p> <p>An example of a parallelized loop taken from Appendix A.1 of the OpenMP Application Program Interface v2.5: </p>
<div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted">SUBROUTINE A1(N, A, B)
  INTEGER I, N
  REAL B(N), A(N)
!$OMP PARALLEL DO !I is private by default
  DO I=2,N
    B(I) = (A(I) + A(I-1)) / 2.0
  ENDDO
!$OMP END PARALLEL DO
END SUBROUTINE A1</pre>
</div> <p>Please note: </p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet"> <li>
<samp class="option">-fopenmp</samp> implies <samp class="option">-frecursive</samp>, i.e., all local arrays will be allocated on the stack. When porting existing code to OpenMP, this may lead to surprising results, especially to segmentation faults if the stacksize is limited. </li>
<li>On glibc-based systems, OpenMP enabled applications cannot be statically linked due to limitations of the underlying pthreads-implementation. It might be possible to get a working solution if <code class="command">-Wl,--whole-archive -lpthread -Wl,--no-whole-archive</code> is added to the command line. However, this is not supported by <code class="command">gcc</code> and thus not recommended. </li>
