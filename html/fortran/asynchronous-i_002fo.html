<h1 class="section" id="Asynchronous-I_002fO-1">4.10 Asynchronous I/O</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Asynchronous-I_002fO">      <p>Asynchronous I/O is supported if the program is linked against the POSIX thread library. If that is not the case, all I/O is performed as synchronous. On systems which do not support pthread condition variables, such as AIX, I/O is also performed as synchronous. </p> <p>On some systems, such as Darwin or Solaris, the POSIX thread library is always linked in, so asynchronous I/O is always performed. On other sytems, such as Linux, it is necessary to specify <samp class="option">-pthread</samp>, <samp class="option">-lpthread</samp> or <samp class="option">-fopenmp</samp> during the linking step. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
