<h1 class="section" id="Enable-and-customize-preprocessing">2.3 Enable and customize preprocessing</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Preprocessing-Options">           <p>Many Fortran compilers including GNU Fortran allow passing the source code through a C preprocessor (CPP; sometimes also called the Fortran preprocessor, FPP) to allow for conditional compilation. In the case of GNU Fortran, this is the GNU C Preprocessor in the traditional mode. On systems with case-preserving file names, the preprocessor is automatically invoked if the filename extension is <samp class="file">.F</samp>, <samp class="file">.FOR</samp>, <samp class="file">.FTN</samp>, <samp class="file">.fpp</samp>, <samp class="file">.FPP</samp>, <samp class="file">.F90</samp>, <samp class="file">.F95</samp>, <samp class="file">.F03</samp> or <samp class="file">.F08</samp>. To manually invoke the preprocessor on any file, use <samp class="option">-cpp</samp>, to disable preprocessing on files where the preprocessor is run automatically, use <samp class="option">-nocpp</samp>. </p> <p>If a preprocessed file includes another file with the Fortran <code class="code">INCLUDE</code> statement, the included file is not preprocessed. To preprocess included files, use the equivalent preprocessor statement <code class="code">#include</code>. </p> <p>If GNU Fortran invokes the preprocessor, <code class="code">__GFORTRAN__</code> is defined. The macros <code class="code">__GNUC__</code>, <code class="code">__GNUC_MINOR__</code> and <code class="code">__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__</code> can be used to determine the version of the compiler. See <a data-manual="cpp" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/index.html#Top">Overview</a> in The C Preprocessor for details. </p> <p>GNU Fortran supports a number of <code class="code">INTEGER</code> and <code class="code">REAL</code> kind types in additional to the kind types required by the Fortran standard. The availability of any given kind type is architecture dependent. The following pre-defined preprocessor macros can be used to conditionally include code for these additional kind types: <code class="code">__GFC_INT_1__</code>, <code class="code">__GFC_INT_2__</code>, <code class="code">__GFC_INT_8__</code>, <code class="code">__GFC_INT_16__</code>, <code class="code">__GFC_REAL_10__</code>, and <code class="code">__GFC_REAL_16__</code>. </p> <p>While CPP is the de-facto standard for preprocessing Fortran code, Part 3 of the Fortran 95 standard (ISO/IEC 1539-3:1998) defines Conditional Compilation, which is not widely used and not directly supported by the GNU Fortran compiler. You can use the program coco to preprocess such files (<a class="uref" href="http://www.daniellnagle.com/coco.html">http://www.daniellnagle.com/coco.html</a>). </p> <p>The following options control preprocessing of Fortran code: </p> <dl class="table"> <dt>
   <span><code class="code">-cpp</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-nocpp</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Enable preprocessing. The preprocessor is automatically invoked if the file extension is <samp class="file">.fpp</samp>, <samp class="file">.FPP</samp>, <samp class="file">.F</samp>, <samp class="file">.FOR</samp>, <samp class="file">.FTN</samp>, <samp class="file">.F90</samp>, <samp class="file">.F95</samp>, <samp class="file">.F03</samp> or <samp class="file">.F08</samp>. Use this option to manually enable preprocessing of any kind of Fortran file. </p> <p>To disable preprocessing of files with any of the above listed extensions, use the negative form: <samp class="option">-nocpp</samp>. </p> <p>The preprocessor is run in traditional mode. Any restrictions of the file-format, especially the limits on line length, apply for preprocessed output as well, so it might be advisable to use the <samp class="option">-ffree-line-length-none</samp> or <samp class="option">-ffixed-line-length-none</samp> options. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-dM</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <code class="code">'#define'</code> directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros. This gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor. Assuming you have no file <samp class="file">foo.f90</samp>, the command </p>
<div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted">touch foo.f90; gfortran -cpp -E -dM foo.f90</pre>
</div> <p>will show all the predefined macros. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-dD</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Like <samp class="option">-dM</samp> except in two respects: it does not include the predefined macros, and it outputs both the <code class="code">#define</code> directives and the result of preprocessing. Both kinds of output go to the standard output file. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-dN</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Like <samp class="option">-dD</samp>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-dU</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Like <samp class="option">dD</samp> except that only macros that are expanded, or whose definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and <code class="code">'#undef'</code> directives are also output for macros tested but undefined at the time. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-dI</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Output <code class="code">'#include'</code> directives in addition to the result of preprocessing. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-fworking-directory</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of preprocessing. When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the current working directory followed by two slashes. GCC will use this directory, when it is present in the preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging information formats. This option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated form <samp class="option">-fno-working-directory</samp>. If the <samp class="option">-P</samp> flag is present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no <code class="code">#line</code> directives are emitted whatsoever. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-idirafter <var class="var">dir</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Search <var class="var">dir</var> for include files, but do it after all directories specified with <samp class="option">-I</samp> and the standard system directories have been exhausted. <var class="var">dir</var> is treated as a system include directory. If dir begins with <code class="code">=</code>, then the <code class="code">=</code> will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see <samp class="option">--sysroot</samp> and <samp class="option">-isysroot</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-imultilib <var class="var">dir</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Use <var class="var">dir</var> as a subdirectory of the directory containing target-specific C++ headers. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-iprefix <var class="var">prefix</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Specify <var class="var">prefix</var> as the prefix for subsequent <samp class="option">-iwithprefix</samp> options. If the <var class="var">prefix</var> represents a directory, you should include the final <code class="code">'/'</code>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-isysroot <var class="var">dir</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>This option is like the <samp class="option">--sysroot</samp> option, but applies only to header files. See the <samp class="option">--sysroot</samp> option for more information. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-iquote <var class="var">dir</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Search <var class="var">dir</var> only for header files requested with <code class="code">#include "file"</code>; they are not searched for <code class="code">#include &lt;file&gt;</code>, before all directories specified by <samp class="option">-I</samp> and before the standard system directories. If <var class="var">dir</var> begins with <code class="code">=</code>, then the <code class="code">=</code> will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see <samp class="option">--sysroot</samp> and <samp class="option">-isysroot</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-isystem <var class="var">dir</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Search <var class="var">dir</var> for header files, after all directories specified by <samp class="option">-I</samp> but before the standard system directories. Mark it as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as is applied to the standard system directories. If <var class="var">dir</var> begins with <code class="code">=</code>, then the <code class="code">=</code> will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see <samp class="option">--sysroot</samp> and <samp class="option">-isysroot</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-nostdinc</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Do not search the standard system directories for header files. Only the directories you have specified with <samp class="option">-I</samp> options (and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-undef</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros. The standard predefined macros remain defined. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-A<var class="var">predicate</var>=<var class="var">answer</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Make an assertion with the predicate <var class="var">predicate</var> and answer <var class="var">answer</var>. This form is preferred to the older form -A predicate(answer), which is still supported, because it does not use shell special characters. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-A-<var class="var">predicate</var>=<var class="var">answer</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Cancel an assertion with the predicate <var class="var">predicate</var> and answer <var class="var">answer</var>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-C</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Do not discard comments. All comments are passed through to the output file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted along with the directive. </p> <p>You should be prepared for side effects when using <samp class="option">-C</samp>; it causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right. For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a <code class="code">'#'</code>. </p> <p>Warning: this currently handles C-Style comments only. The preprocessor does not yet recognize Fortran-style comments. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-CC</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion. This is like <samp class="option">-C</samp>, except that comments contained within macros are also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded. </p> <p>In addition to the side-effects of the <samp class="option">-C</samp> option, the <samp class="option">-CC</samp> option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be converted to C-style comments. This is to prevent later use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line. The <samp class="option">-CC</samp> option is generally used to support lint comments. </p> <p>Warning: this currently handles C- and C++-Style comments only. The preprocessor does not yet recognize Fortran-style comments. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-D<var class="var">name</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Predefine name as a macro, with definition <code class="code">1</code>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-D<var class="var">name</var>=<var class="var">definition</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>The contents of <var class="var">definition</var> are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a <code class="code">'#define'</code> directive. In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline characters. </p> <p>If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the shell’s quoting syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax. </p> <p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if any). Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need to quote the option. With sh and csh, <code class="code">-D'name(args...)=definition'</code> works. </p> <p><samp class="option">-D</samp> and <samp class="option">-U</samp> options are processed in the order they are given on the command line. All -imacros file and -include file options are processed after all -D and -U options. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-H</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal activities. Each name is indented to show how deep in the <code class="code">'#include'</code> stack it is. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-P</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor. This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the linemarkers. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-U<var class="var">name</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd><p>Cancel any previous definition of <var class="var">name</var>, either built in or provided with a <samp class="option">-D</samp> option. </p></dd> </dl> </div><div class="_attribution">
