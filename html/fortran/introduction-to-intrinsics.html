<h1 class="section" id="Introduction-to-intrinsic-procedures">8.1 Introduction to intrinsic procedures</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Introduction-to-Intrinsics">    <p>The intrinsic procedures provided by GNU Fortran include procedures required by the Fortran 95 and later supported standards, and a set of intrinsic procedures for backwards compatibility with G77. Any conflict between a description here and a description in the Fortran standards is unintentional, and the standard(s) should be considered authoritative. </p> <p>The enumeration of the <code class="code">KIND</code> type parameter is processor defined in the Fortran 95 standard. GNU Fortran defines the default integer type and default real type by <code class="code">INTEGER(KIND=4)</code> and <code class="code">REAL(KIND=4)</code>, respectively. The standard mandates that both data types shall have another kind, which have more precision. On typical target architectures supported by <code class="command">gfortran</code>, this kind type parameter is <code class="code">KIND=8</code>. Hence, <code class="code">REAL(KIND=8)</code> and <code class="code">DOUBLE PRECISION</code> are equivalent. In the description of generic intrinsic procedures, the kind type parameter will be specified by <code class="code">KIND=*</code>, and in the description of specific names for an intrinsic procedure the kind type parameter will be explicitly given (e.g., <code class="code">REAL(KIND=4)</code> or <code class="code">REAL(KIND=8)</code>). Finally, for brevity the optional <code class="code">KIND=</code> syntax will be omitted. </p> <p>Many of the intrinsic procedures take one or more optional arguments. This document follows the convention used in the Fortran 95 standard, and denotes such arguments by square brackets. </p> <p>GNU Fortran offers the <samp class="option">-std=</samp> command-line option, which can be used to restrict the set of intrinsic procedures to a given standard. By default, <code class="command">gfortran</code> sets the <samp class="option">-std=gnu</samp> option, and so all intrinsic procedures described here are accepted. There is one caveat. For a select group of intrinsic procedures, <code class="command">g77</code> implemented both a function and a subroutine. Both classes have been implemented in <code class="command">gfortran</code> for backwards compatibility with <code class="command">g77</code>. It is noted here that these functions and subroutines cannot be intermixed in a given subprogram. In the descriptions that follow, the applicable standard for each intrinsic procedure is noted. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
