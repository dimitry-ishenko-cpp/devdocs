It must be placed immediately before a <code class="code">DO</code> loop and applies only to the loop that follows. </p> <p>Sometimes the compiler may not have sufficient information to decide whether a particular loop is vectorizable due to potential dependencies between iterations. The purpose of the directive is to tell the compiler that vectorization is safe. </p> <p>For <code class="code">DO CONCURRENT</code> constructs this annotation is implicit to all loop control variables. </p> <p>This directive is intended for annotation of existing code. For new code it is recommended to consider OpenMP SIMD directives as potential alternative. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
