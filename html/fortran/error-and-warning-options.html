<h1 class="section" id="Options-to-request-or-suppress-errors-and-warnings">2.4 Options to request or suppress errors and warnings</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Error-and-Warning-Options">          <p>Errors are diagnostic messages that report that the GNU Fortran compiler cannot compile the relevant piece of source code. The compiler will continue to process the program in an attempt to report further errors to aid in debugging, but will not produce any compiled output. </p> <p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there is likely to be a bug in the program. Unless <samp class="option">-Werror</samp> is specified, they do not prevent compilation of the program. </p> <p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning <samp class="option">-W</samp>, for example <samp class="option">-Wimplicit</samp> to request warnings on implicit declarations. Each of these specific warning options also has a negative form beginning <samp class="option">-Wno-</samp> to turn off warnings; for example, <samp class="option">-Wno-implicit</samp>. This manual lists only one of the two forms, whichever is not the default. </p> <p>These options control the amount and kinds of errors and warnings produced by GNU Fortran: </p> <dl class="table"> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-fmax-errors=<var class="var">n</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Limits the maximum number of error messages to <var class="var">n</var>, at which point GNU Fortran bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source code. If <var class="var">n</var> is 0, there is no limit on the number of error messages produced. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-fsyntax-only</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Check the code for syntax errors, but do not actually compile it. This will generate module files for each module present in the code, but no other output file. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wpedantic</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-pedantic</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Issue warnings for uses of extensions to Fortran. <samp class="option">-pedantic</samp> also applies to C-language constructs where they occur in GNU Fortran source files, such as use of ‘<samp class="samp">\e</samp>’ in a character constant within a directive like <code class="code">#include</code>. </p> <p>Valid Fortran programs should compile properly with or without this option. However, without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional Fortran features are supported as well. With this option, many of them are rejected. </p> <p>Some users try to use <samp class="option">-pedantic</samp> to check programs for conformance. They soon find that it does not do quite what they want—it finds some nonstandard practices, but not all. However, improvements to GNU Fortran in this area are welcome. </p> <p>This should be used in conjunction with <samp class="option">-std=f95</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f2003</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f2008</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f2018</samp> or <samp class="option">-std=f2023</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-pedantic-errors</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Like <samp class="option">-pedantic</samp>, except that errors are produced rather than warnings. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wall</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Enables commonly used warning options pertaining to usage that we recommend avoiding and that we believe are easy to avoid. This currently includes <samp class="option">-Waliasing</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wampersand</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wconversion</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wsurprising</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wc-binding-type</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wintrinsics-std</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wtabs</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wintrinsic-shadow</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wline-truncation</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wtarget-lifetime</samp>, <samp class="option">-Winteger-division</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wreal-q-constant</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wunused</samp> and <samp class="option">-Wundefined-do-loop</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Waliasing</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn about possible aliasing of dummy arguments. Specifically, it warns if the same actual argument is associated with a dummy argument with <code class="code">INTENT(IN)</code> and a dummy argument with <code class="code">INTENT(OUT)</code> in a call with an explicit interface. </p> <p>The following example will trigger the warning. </p>
<div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted">interface
  subroutine bar(a,b)
    integer, intent(in) :: a
    integer, intent(out) :: b
  end subroutine
end interface
integer :: a

call bar(a,a)</pre>
</div> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wampersand</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn about missing ampersand in continued character constants. The warning is given with <samp class="option">-Wampersand</samp>, <samp class="option">-pedantic</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f95</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f2003</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f2008</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f2018</samp> and <samp class="option">-std=f2023</samp>. Note: With no ampersand given in a continued character constant, GNU Fortran assumes continuation at the first non-comment, non-whitespace character after the ampersand that initiated the continuation. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Warray-temporaries</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn about array temporaries generated by the compiler. The information generated by this warning is sometimes useful in optimization, in order to avoid such temporaries. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wc-binding-type</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if the a variable might not be C interoperable. In particular, warn if the variable has been declared using an intrinsic type with default kind instead of using a kind parameter defined for C interoperability in the intrinsic <code class="code">ISO_C_Binding</code> module. This option is implied by <samp class="option">-Wall</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wcharacter-truncation</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn when a character assignment will truncate the assigned string. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wline-truncation</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn when a source code line will be truncated. This option is implied by <samp class="option">-Wall</samp>. For free-form source code, the default is <samp class="option">-Werror=line-truncation</samp> such that truncations are reported as error. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wconversion</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn about implicit conversions that are likely to change the value of the expression after conversion. Implied by <samp class="option">-Wall</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wconversion-extra</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn about implicit conversions between different types and kinds. This option does <em class="emph">not</em> imply <samp class="option">-Wconversion</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wextra</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Enables some warning options for usages of language features which may be problematic. This currently includes <samp class="option">-Wcompare-reals</samp>, <samp class="option">-Wunused-parameter</samp> and <samp class="option">-Wdo-subscript</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wfrontend-loop-interchange</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn when using <samp class="option">-ffrontend-loop-interchange</samp> for performing loop interchanges. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wimplicit-interface</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if a procedure is called without an explicit interface. Note this only checks that an explicit interface is present. It does not check that the declared interfaces are consistent across program units. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wimplicit-procedure</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if a procedure is called that has neither an explicit interface nor has been declared as <code class="code">EXTERNAL</code>. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Winteger-division</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if a constant integer division truncates its result. As an example, 3/5 evaluates to 0. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wintrinsics-std</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if <code class="command">gfortran</code> finds a procedure named like an intrinsic not available in the currently selected standard (with <samp class="option">-std</samp>) and treats it as <code class="code">EXTERNAL</code> procedure because of this. <samp class="option">-fall-intrinsics</samp> can be used to never trigger this behavior and always link to the intrinsic regardless of the selected standard. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wno-overwrite-recursive</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Do not warn when <samp class="option">-fno-automatic</samp> is used with <samp class="option">-frecursive</samp>. Recursion will be broken if the relevant local variables do not have the attribute <code class="code">AUTOMATIC</code> explicitly declared. This option can be used to suppress the warning when it is known that recursion is not broken. Useful for build environments that use <samp class="option">-Werror</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wreal-q-constant</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Produce a warning if a real-literal-constant contains a <code class="code">q</code> exponent-letter. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wsurprising</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Produce a warning when “suspicious” code constructs are encountered. While technically legal these usually indicate that an error has been made. </p> <p>This currently produces a warning under the following circumstances: </p> <ul class="itemize mark-bullet"> <li>An INTEGER SELECT construct has a CASE that can never be matched as its lower value is greater than its upper value. </li>
<li>A LOGICAL SELECT construct has three CASE statements. </li>
<li>A TRANSFER specifies a source that is shorter than the destination. </li>
<li>The type of a function result is declared more than once with the same type. If <samp class="option">-pedantic</samp> or standard-conforming mode is enabled, this is an error. </li>
<li>A <code class="code">CHARACTER</code> variable is declared with negative length. </li>
<li>With <samp class="option">-fopenmp</samp>, for fixed-form source code, when an <code class="code">omx</code> vendor-extension sentinel is encountered. (The equivalent <code class="code">ompx</code>, used in free-form source code, is diagnosed by default.) </li>
</ul> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wtabs</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>By default, tabs are accepted as whitespace, but tabs are not members of the Fortran Character Set. For continuation lines, a tab followed by a digit between 1 and 9 is supported. <samp class="option">-Wtabs</samp> will cause a warning to be issued if a tab is encountered. Note, <samp class="option">-Wtabs</samp> is active for <samp class="option">-pedantic</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f95</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f2003</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f2008</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f2018</samp>, <samp class="option">-std=f2023</samp> and <samp class="option">-Wall</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wundefined-do-loop</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if a DO loop with step either 1 or -1 yields an underflow or an overflow during iteration of an induction variable of the loop. This option is implied by <samp class="option">-Wall</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wunderflow</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Produce a warning when numerical constant expressions are encountered, which yield an UNDERFLOW during compilation. Enabled by default. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wintrinsic-shadow</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if a user-defined procedure or module procedure has the same name as an intrinsic; in this case, an explicit interface or <code class="code">EXTERNAL</code> or <code class="code">INTRINSIC</code> declaration might be needed to get calls later resolved to the desired intrinsic/procedure. This option is implied by <samp class="option">-Wall</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wuse-without-only</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if a <code class="code">USE</code> statement has no <code class="code">ONLY</code> qualifier and thus implicitly imports all public entities of the used module. </p> </dd> <dt>
   <span><code class="code">-Wunused-dummy-argument</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn about unused dummy arguments. This option is implied by <samp class="option">-Wall</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wunused-parameter</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Contrary to <code class="command">gcc</code>’s meaning of <samp class="option">-Wunused-parameter</samp>, <code class="command">gfortran</code>’s implementation of this option does not warn about unused dummy arguments (see <samp class="option">-Wunused-dummy-argument</samp>), but about unused <code class="code">PARAMETER</code> values. <samp class="option">-Wunused-parameter</samp> is implied by <samp class="option">-Wextra</samp> if also <samp class="option">-Wunused</samp> or <samp class="option">-Wall</samp> is used. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Walign-commons</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>By default, <code class="command">gfortran</code> warns about any occasion of variables being padded for proper alignment inside a <code class="code">COMMON</code> block. This warning can be turned off via <samp class="option">-Wno-align-commons</samp>. See also <samp class="option">-falign-commons</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-Wfunction-elimination</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if any calls to impure functions are eliminated by the optimizations enabled by the <samp class="option">-ffrontend-optimize</samp> option. This option is implied by <samp class="option">-Wextra</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Wrealloc-lhs</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn when the compiler might insert code to for allocation or reallocation of an allocatable array variable of intrinsic type in intrinsic assignments. In hot loops, the Fortran 2003 reallocation feature may reduce the performance. If the array is already allocated with the correct shape, consider using a whole-array array-spec (e.g. <code class="code">(:,:,:)</code>) for the variable on the left-hand side to prevent the reallocation check. Note that in some cases the warning is shown, even if the compiler will optimize reallocation checks away. For instance, when the right-hand side contains the same variable multiplied by a scalar. See also <samp class="option">-frealloc-lhs</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-Wrealloc-lhs-all</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn when the compiler inserts code to for allocation or reallocation of an allocatable variable; this includes scalars and derived types. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-Wcompare-reals</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn when comparing real or complex types for equality or inequality. This option is implied by <samp class="option">-Wextra</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-Wtarget-lifetime</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if the pointer in a pointer assignment might be longer than the its target. This option is implied by <samp class="option">-Wall</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-Wzerotrip</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if a <code class="code">DO</code> loop is known to execute zero times at compile time. This option is implied by <samp class="option">-Wall</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-Wdo-subscript</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Warn if an array subscript inside a DO loop could lead to an out-of-bounds access even if the compiler cannot prove that the statement is actually executed, in cases like </p>
<div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted">real a(3)
do i=1,4
  if (condition(i)) then
    a(i) = 1.2
  end if
end do</pre>
</div> <p>This option is implied by <samp class="option">-Wextra</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-Werror</code></span>
</dt> <dd><p>Turns all warnings into errors. </p></dd> </dl> <p>See <a data-manual="gcc" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#Warning-Options">Options to Request or Suppress Errors and Warnings</a> in Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), for information on more options offered by the GBE shared by <code class="command">gfortran</code>, <code class="command">gcc</code> and other GNU compilers. </p> <p>Some of these have no effect when compiling programs written in Fortran. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
