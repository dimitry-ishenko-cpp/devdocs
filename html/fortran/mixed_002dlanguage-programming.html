<h1 class="chapter" id="Mixed_002dLanguage-Programming-1">6 Mixed-Language Programming</h1> <div class="chapter-level-extent" id="Mixed_002dLanguage-Programming">      <p>This chapter is about mixed-language interoperability, but also applies if you link Fortran code compiled by different compilers. In most cases, use of the C Binding features of the Fortran 2003 and later standards is sufficient. </p> <p>For example, it is possible to mix Fortran code with C++ code as well as C, if you declare the interface functions as <code class="code">extern "C"</code> on the C++ side and <code class="code">BIND(C)</code> on the Fortran side, and follow the rules for interoperability with C. Note that you cannot manipulate C++ class objects in Fortran or vice versa except as opaque pointers. </p> <p>You can use the <code class="command">gfortran</code> command to link both Fortran and non-Fortran code into the same program, or you can use <code class="command">gcc</code> or <code class="command">g++</code> if you also add an explicit <samp class="option">-lgfortran</samp> option to link with the Fortran library. If your main program is written in C or some other language instead of Fortran, see <a class="ref" href="non_002dfortran-main-program.html">Non-Fortran Main Program</a>, below. </p> <ul class="mini-toc"> <li><a href="interoperability-with-c.html" accesskey="1">Interoperability with C</a></li> <li><a href="gnu-fortran-compiler-directives.html" accesskey="2">GNU Fortran Compiler Directives</a></li> <li><a href="non_002dfortran-main-program.html" accesskey="3">Non-Fortran Main Program</a></li> <li><a href="naming-and-argument_002dpassing-conventions.html" accesskey="4">Naming and argument-passing conventions</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
