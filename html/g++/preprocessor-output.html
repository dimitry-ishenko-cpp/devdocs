However, it can also be used in the more conventional standalone mode, where it produces textual output. </p>  <p>The output from the C preprocessor looks much like the input, except that all preprocessing directive lines have been replaced with blank lines and all comments with spaces. Long runs of blank lines are discarded. </p> <p>The ISO standard specifies that it is implementation defined whether a preprocessor preserves whitespace between tokens, or replaces it with e.g. a single space. In GNU CPP, whitespace between tokens is collapsed to become a single space, with the exception that the first token on a non-directive line is preceded with sufficient spaces that it appears in the same column in the preprocessed output that it appeared in the original source file. This is so the output is easy to read. CPP does not insert any whitespace where there was none in the original source, except where necessary to prevent an accidental token paste. </p>  <p>Source file name and line number information is conveyed by lines of the form </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp"># <var class="var">linenum</var> <var class="var">filename</var> <var class="var">flags</var></pre>
</div> <p>These are called <em class="dfn">linemarkers</em>. They are inserted as needed into the output (but never within a string or character constant). They mean that the following line originated in file <var class="var">filename</var> at line <var class="var">linenum</var>. <var class="var">filename</var> will never contain any non-printing characters; they are replaced with octal escape sequences. </p> <p>After the file name comes zero or more flags, which are ‘<samp class="samp">1</samp>’, ‘<samp class="samp">2</samp>’, ‘<samp class="samp">3</samp>’, or ‘<samp class="samp">4</samp>’. If there are multiple flags, spaces separate them. Here is what the flags mean: </p> <dl class="table"> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">1</samp>’</dt> <dd><p>This indicates the start of a new file. </p></dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">2</samp>’</dt> <dd><p>This indicates returning to a file (after having included another file). </p></dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">3</samp>’</dt> <dd><p>This indicates that the following text comes from a system header file, so certain warnings should be suppressed. </p></dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">4</samp>’</dt> <dd><p>This indicates that the following text should be treated as being wrapped in an implicit <code class="code">extern "C"</code> block. </p></dd> </dl> <p>As an extension, the preprocessor accepts linemarkers in non-assembler input files. They are treated like the corresponding ‘<samp class="samp">#line</samp>’ directive, (see <a class="pxref" href="line-control.html">Line Control</a>), except that trailing flags are permitted, and are interpreted with the meanings described above. If multiple flags are given, they must be in ascending order. </p> <p>Some directives may be duplicated in the output of the preprocessor. These are ‘<samp class="samp">#ident</samp>’ (always), ‘<samp class="samp">#pragma</samp>’ (only if the preprocessor does not handle the pragma itself), and ‘<samp class="samp">#define</samp>’ and ‘<samp class="samp">#undef</samp>’ (with certain debugging options). If this happens, the ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’ of the directive will always be in the first column, and there will be no space between the ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’ and the directive name. If macro expansion happens to generate tokens which might be mistaken for a duplicated directive, a space will be inserted between the ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’ and the directive name. </p> </div>  <div class="nav-panel"> <p> Next: <a href="traditional-mode.html">Traditional Mode</a>, Previous: <a href="other-directives.html">Other Directives</a> [<a href="index.html#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-13.1.0/cpp/Index-of-Directives.html" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
