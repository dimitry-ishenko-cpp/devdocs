<h1 class="subsection" id="Elif-1">4.2.5 Elif</h1> <div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Elif">     <p>One common case of nested conditionals is used to check for more than two possible alternatives. For example, you might have </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#if X == 1
…
#else /* X != 1 */
#if X == 2
…
#else /* X != 2 */
…
#endif /* X != 2 */
#endif /* X != 1 */</pre>
</div> <p>Another conditional directive, ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’, allows this to be abbreviated as follows: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#if X == 1
…
#elif X == 2
…
#else /* X != 2 and X != 1*/
…
#endif /* X != 2 and X != 1*/</pre>
</div> <p>‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ stands for “else if”. Like ‘<samp class="samp">#else</samp>’, it goes in the middle of a conditional group and subdivides it; it does not require a matching ‘<samp class="samp">#endif</samp>’ of its own. Like ‘<samp class="samp">#if</samp>’, the ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ directive includes an expression to be tested. The text following the ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ is processed only if the original ‘<samp class="samp">#if</samp>’-condition failed and the ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ condition succeeds. </p> <p>More than one ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ can go in the same conditional group. Then the text after each ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ is processed only if the ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ condition succeeds after the original ‘<samp class="samp">#if</samp>’ and all previous ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ directives within it have failed. </p> <p>‘<samp class="samp">#else</samp>’ is allowed after any number of ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ directives, but ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ may not follow ‘<samp class="samp">#else</samp>’. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
