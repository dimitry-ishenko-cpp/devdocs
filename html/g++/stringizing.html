<h1 class="section" id="Stringizing-1">3.4 Stringizing</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Stringizing">      <p>Sometimes you may want to convert a macro argument into a string constant. Parameters are not replaced inside string constants, but you can use the ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’ preprocessing operator instead. When a macro parameter is used with a leading ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’, the preprocessor replaces it with the literal text of the actual argument, converted to a string constant. Unlike normal parameter replacement, the argument is not macro-expanded first. This is called <em class="dfn">stringizing</em>. </p> <p>There is no way to combine an argument with surrounding text and stringize it all together. Instead, you can write a series of adjacent string constants and stringized arguments. The preprocessor replaces the stringized arguments with string constants. The C compiler then combines all the adjacent string constants into one long string. </p> <p>Here is an example of a macro definition that uses stringizing: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#define WARN_IF(EXP) \
do { if (EXP) \
        fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " #EXP "\n"); } \
while (0)
WARN_IF (x == 0);
     → do { if (x == 0)
           fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " "x == 0" "\n"); } while (0);</pre></div>
</div> <p>The argument for <code class="code">EXP</code> is substituted once, as-is, into the <code class="code">if</code> statement, and once, stringized, into the argument to <code class="code">fprintf</code>. If <code class="code">x</code> were a macro, it would be expanded in the <code class="code">if</code> statement, but not in the string. </p> <p>The <code class="code">do</code> and <code class="code">while (0)</code> are a kludge to make it possible to write <code class="code">WARN_IF (<var class="var">arg</var>);</code>, which the resemblance of <code class="code">WARN_IF</code> to a function would make C programmers want to do; see <a class="ref" href="swallowing-the-semicolon.html">Swallowing the Semicolon</a>. </p> <p>Stringizing in C involves more than putting double-quote characters around the fragment. The preprocessor backslash-escapes the quotes surrounding embedded string constants, and all backslashes within string and character constants, in order to get a valid C string constant with the proper contents. Thus, stringizing <code class="code">p = "foo\n";</code> results in <code class="t">"p = \"foo\\n\";"</code>. However, backslashes that are not inside string or character constants are not duplicated: ‘<samp class="samp">\n</samp>’ by itself stringizes to <code class="t">"\n"</code>. </p> <p>All leading and trailing whitespace in text being stringized is ignored. Any sequence of whitespace in the middle of the text is converted to a single space in the stringized result. Comments are replaced by whitespace long before stringizing happens, so they never appear in stringized text. </p> <p>There is no way to convert a macro argument into a character constant. </p> <p>If you want to stringize the result of expansion of a macro argument, you have to use two levels of macros. </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#define xstr(s) str(s)
#define str(s) #s
#define foo 4
str (foo)
     → "foo"
xstr (foo)
     → xstr (4)
     → str (4)
     → "4"</pre>
</div> <p><code class="code">s</code> is stringized when it is used in <code class="code">str</code>, so it is not macro-expanded first. But <code class="code">s</code> is an ordinary argument to <code class="code">xstr</code>, so it is completely macro-expanded before <code class="code">xstr</code> itself is expanded (see <a class="pxref" href="argument-prescan.html">Argument Prescan</a>). Therefore, by the time <code class="code">str</code> gets to its argument, it has already been macro-expanded. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
