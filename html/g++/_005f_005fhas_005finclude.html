<h1 class="subsection" id="g_t_005f_005fhas_005finclude-1">4.2.12 __has_include</h1> <div class="subsection-level-extent" id="g_t_005f_005fhas_005finclude">     <p>The special operator <code class="code">__has_include (<var class="var">operand</var>)</code> may be used in ‘<samp class="samp">#if</samp>’ and ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’ expressions to test whether the header referenced by its <var class="var">operand</var> can be included using the ‘<samp class="samp">#include</samp>’ directive. Using the operator in other contexts is not valid. The <var class="var">operand</var> takes the same form as the file in the ‘<samp class="samp">#include</samp>’ directive (see <a class="pxref" href="include-syntax.html">Include Syntax</a>) and evaluates to a nonzero value if the header can be included and to zero otherwise. Note that that the ability to include a header doesn’t imply that the header doesn’t contain invalid constructs or ‘<samp class="samp">#error</samp>’ directives that would cause the preprocessor to fail. </p> <p>The <code class="code">__has_include</code> operator by itself, without any <var class="var">operand</var> or parentheses, acts as a predefined macro so that support for it can be tested in portable code. Thus, the recommended use of the operator is as follows: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#if defined __has_include
#  if __has_include (&lt;stdatomic.h&gt;)
#    include &lt;stdatomic.h&gt;
#  endif
#endif</pre>
</div> <p>The first ‘<samp class="samp">#if</samp>’ test succeeds only when the operator is supported by the version of GCC (or another compiler) being used. Only when that test succeeds is it valid to use <code class="code">__has_include</code> as a preprocessor operator. As a result, combining the two tests into a single expression as shown below would only be valid with a compiler that supports the operator but not with others that don’t. </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#if defined __has_include &amp;&amp; __has_include ("header.h")   /* not portable */
…
#endif</pre>
