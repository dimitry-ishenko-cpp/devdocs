<h1 class="section" id="Deleted-Code-1">4.3 Deleted Code</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Deleted-Code">     <p>If you replace or delete a part of the program but want to keep the old code around for future reference, you often cannot simply comment it out. Block comments do not nest, so the first comment inside the old code will end the commenting-out. The probable result is a flood of syntax errors. </p> <p>One way to avoid this problem is to use an always-false conditional instead. For instance, put <code class="code">#if 0</code> before the deleted code and <code class="code">#endif</code> after it. This works even if the code being turned off contains conditionals, but they must be entire conditionals (balanced ‘<samp class="samp">#if</samp>’ and ‘<samp class="samp">#endif</samp>’). </p> <p>Some people use <code class="code">#ifdef notdef</code> instead. This is risky, because <code class="code">notdef</code> might be accidentally defined as a macro, and then the conditional would succeed. <code class="code">#if 0</code> can be counted on to fail. </p> <p>Do not use <code class="code">#if 0</code> for comments which are not C code. Use a real comment, instead. The interior of <code class="code">#if 0</code> must consist of complete tokens; in particular, single-quote characters must balance. Comments often contain unbalanced single-quote characters (known in English as apostrophes). These confuse <code class="code">#if 0</code>. They don’t confuse ‘<samp class="samp">/*</samp>’. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
