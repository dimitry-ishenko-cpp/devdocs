Block comments do not nest, so the first comment inside the old code will end the commenting-out. The probable result is a flood of syntax errors. </p> <p>One way to avoid this problem is to use an always-false conditional instead. For instance, put <code class="code">#if 0</code> before the deleted code and <code class="code">#endif</code> after it. This works even if the code being turned off contains conditionals, but they must be entire conditionals (balanced ‘<samp class="samp">#if</samp>’ and ‘<samp class="samp">#endif</samp>’). </p> <p>Some people use <code class="code">#ifdef notdef</code> instead. This is risky, because <code class="code">notdef</code> might be accidentally defined as a macro, and then the conditional would succeed. <code class="code">#if 0</code> can be counted on to fail. </p> <p>Do not use <code class="code">#if 0</code> for comments which are not C code. Use a real comment, instead. The interior of <code class="code">#if 0</code> must consist of complete tokens; in particular, single-quote characters must balance. Comments often contain unbalanced single-quote characters (known in English as apostrophes). These confuse <code class="code">#if 0</code>. They don’t confuse ‘<samp class="samp">/*</samp>’. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
