<h1 class="section" id="Search-Path-1">2.3 Search Path</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Search-Path">    <p>By default, the preprocessor looks for header files included by the quote form of the directive <code class="code">#include "<var class="var">file</var>"</code> first relative to the directory of the current file, and then in a preconfigured list of standard system directories. For example, if <samp class="file">/usr/include/sys/stat.h</samp> contains <code class="code">#include "types.h"</code>, GCC looks for <samp class="file">types.h</samp> first in <samp class="file">/usr/include/sys</samp>, then in its usual search path. </p> <p>For the angle-bracket form <code class="code">#include &lt;<var class="var">file</var>&gt;</code>, the preprocessor’s default behavior is to look only in the standard system directories. The exact search directory list depends on the target system, how GCC is configured, and where it is installed. You can find the default search directory list for your version of CPP by invoking it with the <samp class="option">-v</samp> option. For example, </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">cpp -v /dev/null -o /dev/null</pre>
</div> <p>There are a number of command-line options you can use to add additional directories to the search path. The most commonly-used option is <samp class="option">-I<var class="var">dir</var></samp>, which causes <var class="var">dir</var> to be searched after the current directory (for the quote form of the directive) and ahead of the standard system directories. You can specify multiple <samp class="option">-I</samp> options on the command line, in which case the directories are searched in left-to-right order. </p> <p>If you need separate control over the search paths for the quote and angle-bracket forms of the ‘<samp class="samp">#include</samp>’ directive, you can use the <samp class="option">-iquote</samp> and/or <samp class="option">-isystem</samp> options instead of <samp class="option">-I</samp>. See <a class="xref" href="invocation.html">Invocation</a>, for a detailed description of these options, as well as others that are less generally useful. </p> <p>If you specify other options on the command line, such as <samp class="option">-I</samp>, that affect where the preprocessor searches for header files, the directory list printed by the <samp class="option">-v</samp> option reflects the actual search path used by the preprocessor. </p> <p>Note that you can also prevent the preprocessor from searching any of the default system header directories with the <samp class="option">-nostdinc</samp> option. This is useful when you are compiling an operating system kernel or some other program that does not use the standard C library facilities, or the standard C library itself. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
