<h1 class="section" id="Traditional-miscellany-1">10.3 Traditional miscellany</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Traditional-miscellany">    <p>Here are some things to be aware of when using the traditional preprocessor. </p> <ul class="itemize mark-bullet"> <li>Preprocessing directives are recognized only when their leading ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’ appears in the first column. There can be no whitespace between the beginning of the line and the ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’, but whitespace can follow the ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’. </li>
<li>A true traditional C preprocessor does not recognize ‘<samp class="samp">#error</samp>’ or ‘<samp class="samp">#pragma</samp>’, and may not recognize ‘<samp class="samp">#elif</samp>’. CPP supports all the directives in traditional mode that it supports in ISO mode, including extensions, with the exception that the effects of ‘<samp class="samp">#pragma GCC poison</samp>’ are undefined. </li>
<li>__STDC__ is not defined. </li>
<li>If you use digraphs the behavior is undefined. </li>
<li>If a line that looks like a directive appears within macro arguments, the behavior is undefined. </li>
