<h1 class="chapter" id="Traditional-Mode-1">10 Traditional Mode</h1> <div class="chapter-level-extent" id="Traditional-Mode">    <p>Traditional (pre-standard) C preprocessing is rather different from the preprocessing specified by the standard. When the preprocessor is invoked with the <samp class="option">-traditional-cpp</samp> option, it attempts to emulate a traditional preprocessor. </p> <p>This mode is not useful for compiling C code with GCC, but is intended for use with non-C preprocessing applications. Thus traditional mode semantics are supported only when invoking the preprocessor explicitly, and not in the compiler front ends. </p> <p>The implementation does not correspond precisely to the behavior of early pre-standard versions of GCC, nor to any true traditional preprocessor. After all, inconsistencies among traditional implementations were a major motivation for C standardization. However, we intend that it should be compatible with true traditional preprocessors in all ways that actually matter. </p> <ul class="mini-toc"> <li><a href="traditional-lexical-analysis.html" accesskey="1">Traditional lexical analysis</a></li> <li><a href="traditional-macros.html" accesskey="2">Traditional macros</a></li> <li><a href="traditional-miscellany.html" accesskey="3">Traditional miscellany</a></li> <li><a href="traditional-warnings.html" accesskey="4">Traditional warnings</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
