<h1 class="chapter" id="Environment-Variables-1">13 Environment Variables</h1> <div class="chapter-level-extent" id="Environment-Variables">     <p>This section describes the environment variables that affect how CPP operates. You can use them to specify directories or prefixes to use when searching for include files, or to control dependency output. </p> <p>Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as <samp class="option">-I</samp>, and control dependency output with options like <samp class="option">-M</samp> (see <a class="pxref" href="invocation.html">Invocation</a>). These take precedence over environment variables, which in turn take precedence over the configuration of GCC. </p> <dl class="vtable"> <dt>
<span><code class="env">CPATH</code></span>
</dt> <dt>
<span><code class="env">C_INCLUDE_PATH</code></span>
</dt> <dt>
<span><code class="env">CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</code></span>
</dt> <dt>
<span><code class="env">OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Each variable’s value is a list of directories separated by a special character, much like <code class="env">PATH</code>, in which to look for header files. The special character, <code class="code">PATH_SEPARATOR</code>, is target-dependent and determined at GCC build time. For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon. </p> <p><code class="env">CPATH</code> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified with <samp class="option">-I</samp>, but after any paths given with <samp class="option">-I</samp> options on the command line. This environment variable is used regardless of which language is being preprocessed. </p> <p>The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the particular language indicated. Each specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified with <samp class="option">-isystem</samp>, but after any paths given with <samp class="option">-isystem</samp> options on the command line. </p> <p>In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to search its current working directory. Empty elements can appear at the beginning or end of a path. For instance, if the value of <code class="env">CPATH</code> is <code class="code">:/special/include</code>, that has the same effect as ‘<samp class="samp">-I. -I/special/include</samp>’. </p> <p>See also <a class="ref" href="search-path.html">Search Path</a>. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="env">DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed by the compiler. System header files are ignored in the dependency output. </p> <p>The value of <code class="env">DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code> can be just a file name, in which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target name from the source file name. Or the value can have the form ‘<samp class="samp"><var class="var">file</var> <var class="var">target</var></samp>’, in which case the rules are written to file <var class="var">file</var> using <var class="var">target</var> as the target name. </p> <p>In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining the options <samp class="option">-MM</samp> and <samp class="option">-MF</samp> (see <a class="pxref" href="invocation.html">Invocation</a>), with an optional <samp class="option">-MT</samp> switch too. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="env">SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>This variable is the same as <code class="env">DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code> (see above), except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies <samp class="option">-M</samp> rather than <samp class="option">-MM</samp>. However, the dependence on the main input file is omitted. See <a class="xref" href="invocation.html">Invocation</a>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="env">SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If this variable is set, its value specifies a UNIX timestamp to be used in replacement of the current date and time in the <code class="code">__DATE__</code> and <code class="code">__TIME__</code> macros, so that the embedded timestamps become reproducible. </p> <p>The value of <code class="env">SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</code> must be a UNIX timestamp, defined as the number of seconds (excluding leap seconds) since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 represented in ASCII; identical to the output of <code class="code">date +%s</code> on GNU/Linux and other systems that support the <code class="code">%s</code> extension in the <code class="code">date</code> command. </p> <p>The value should be a known timestamp such as the last modification time of the source or package and it should be set by the build process. </p> </dd> </dl> </div><div class="_attribution">
