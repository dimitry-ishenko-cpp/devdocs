<h1 class="section" id="Implementation_002ddefined-behavior-1">11.1 Implementation-defined behavior</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Implementation_002ddefined-behavior">     <p>This is how CPP behaves in all the cases which the C standard describes as <em class="dfn">implementation-defined</em>. This term means that the implementation is free to do what it likes, but must document its choice and stick to it. </p> <ul class="itemize mark-bullet"> <li>The mapping of physical source file multi-byte characters to the execution character set. <p>The input character set can be specified using the <samp class="option">-finput-charset</samp> option, while the execution character set may be controlled using the <samp class="option">-fexec-charset</samp> and <samp class="option">-fwide-exec-charset</samp> options. </p> </li>
<li>Identifier characters.  <p>The C and C++ standards allow identifiers to be composed of ‘<samp class="samp">_</samp>’ and the alphanumeric characters. C++ also allows universal character names. C99 and later C standards permit both universal character names and implementation-defined characters. In both C and C++ modes, GCC accepts in identifiers exactly those extended characters that correspond to universal character names permitted by the chosen standard. </p> <p>GCC allows the ‘<samp class="samp">$</samp>’ character in identifiers as an extension for most targets. This is true regardless of the <samp class="option">std=</samp> switch, since this extension cannot conflict with standards-conforming programs. When preprocessing assembler, however, dollars are not identifier characters by default. </p> <p>Currently the targets that by default do not permit ‘<samp class="samp">$</samp>’ are AVR, IP2K, MMIX, MIPS Irix 3, ARM aout, and PowerPC targets for the AIX operating system. </p> <p>You can override the default with <samp class="option">-fdollars-in-identifiers</samp> or <samp class="option">-fno-dollars-in-identifiers</samp>. See <a class="xref" href="invocation.html#fdollars_002din_002didentifiers">fdollars-in-identifiers</a>. </p> </li>
<li>Non-empty sequences of whitespace characters. <p>In textual output, each whitespace sequence is collapsed to a single space. For aesthetic reasons, the first token on each non-directive line of output is preceded with sufficient spaces that it appears in the same column as it did in the original source file. </p> </li>
<li>The numeric value of character constants in preprocessor expressions. <p>The preprocessor and compiler interpret character constants in the same way; i.e. escape sequences such as ‘<samp class="samp">\a</samp>’ are given the values they would have on the target machine. </p> <p>The compiler evaluates a multi-character character constant a character at a time, shifting the previous value left by the number of bits per target character, and then or-ing in the bit-pattern of the new character truncated to the width of a target character. The final bit-pattern is given type <code class="code">int</code>, and is therefore signed, regardless of whether single characters are signed or not. If there are more characters in the constant than would fit in the target <code class="code">int</code> the compiler issues a warning, and the excess leading characters are ignored. </p> <p>For example, <code class="code">'ab'</code> for a target with an 8-bit <code class="code">char</code> would be interpreted as ‘<samp class="samp">(int) ((unsigned char) 'a' * 256 + (unsigned char) 'b')</samp>’, and <code class="code">'\234a'</code> as ‘<samp class="samp">(int) ((unsigned char) '\234' * 256 + (unsigned char) 'a')</samp>’. </p> </li>
<li>Source file inclusion. <p>For a discussion on how the preprocessor locates header files, <a class="ref" href="include-operation.html">Include Operation</a>. </p> </li>
<li>Interpretation of the filename resulting from a macro-expanded ‘<samp class="samp">#include</samp>’ directive. <p>See <a class="xref" href="computed-includes.html">Computed Includes</a>. </p> </li>
<li>Treatment of a ‘<samp class="samp">#pragma</samp>’ directive that after macro-expansion results in a standard pragma. <p>No macro expansion occurs on any ‘<samp class="samp">#pragma</samp>’ directive line, so the question does not arise. </p> <p>Note that GCC does not yet implement any of the standard pragmas. </p> </li>
