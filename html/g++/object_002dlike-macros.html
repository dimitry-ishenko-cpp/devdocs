<h1 class="section" id="Object_002dlike-Macros-1">3.1 Object-like Macros</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Object_002dlike-Macros">       <p>An <em class="dfn">object-like macro</em> is a simple identifier which will be replaced by a code fragment. It is called object-like because it looks like a data object in code that uses it. They are most commonly used to give symbolic names to numeric constants. </p>  <p>You create macros with the ‘<samp class="samp">#define</samp>’ directive. ‘<samp class="samp">#define</samp>’ is followed by the name of the macro and then the token sequence it should be an abbreviation for, which is variously referred to as the macro’s <em class="dfn">body</em>, <em class="dfn">expansion</em> or <em class="dfn">replacement list</em>. For example, </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024</pre>
</div> <p>defines a macro named <code class="code">BUFFER_SIZE</code> as an abbreviation for the token <code class="code">1024</code>. If somewhere after this ‘<samp class="samp">#define</samp>’ directive there comes a C statement of the form </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">foo = (char *) malloc (BUFFER_SIZE);</pre>
</div> <p>then the C preprocessor will recognize and <em class="dfn">expand</em> the macro <code class="code">BUFFER_SIZE</code>. The C compiler will see the same tokens as it would if you had written </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">foo = (char *) malloc (1024);</pre>
</div> <p>By convention, macro names are written in uppercase. Programs are easier to read when it is possible to tell at a glance which names are macros. </p> <p>The macro’s body ends at the end of the ‘<samp class="samp">#define</samp>’ line. You may continue the definition onto multiple lines, if necessary, using backslash-newline. When the macro is expanded, however, it will all come out on one line. For example, </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#define NUMBERS 1, \
                2, \
                3
int x[] = { NUMBERS };
     → int x[] = { 1, 2, 3 };</pre>
</div> <p>The most common visible consequence of this is surprising line numbers in error messages. </p> <p>There is no restriction on what can go in a macro body provided it decomposes into valid preprocessing tokens. Parentheses need not balance, and the body need not resemble valid C code. (If it does not, you may get error messages from the C compiler when you use the macro.) </p> <p>The C preprocessor scans your program sequentially. Macro definitions take effect at the place you write them. Therefore, the following input to the C preprocessor </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">foo = X;
#define X 4
bar = X;</pre>
</div> <p>produces </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">foo = X;
bar = 4;</pre>
</div> <p>When the preprocessor expands a macro name, the macro’s expansion replaces the macro invocation, then the expansion is examined for more macros to expand. For example, </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
#define BUFSIZE 1024
TABLESIZE
     → BUFSIZE
     → 1024</pre></div>
</div> <p><code class="code">TABLESIZE</code> is expanded first to produce <code class="code">BUFSIZE</code>, then that macro is expanded to produce the final result, <code class="code">1024</code>. </p> <p>Notice that <code class="code">BUFSIZE</code> was not defined when <code class="code">TABLESIZE</code> was defined. The ‘<samp class="samp">#define</samp>’ for <code class="code">TABLESIZE</code> uses exactly the expansion you specify—in this case, <code class="code">BUFSIZE</code>—and does not check to see whether it too contains macro names. Only when you <em class="emph">use</em> <code class="code">TABLESIZE</code> is the result of its expansion scanned for more macro names. </p> <p>This makes a difference if you change the definition of <code class="code">BUFSIZE</code> at some point in the source file. <code class="code">TABLESIZE</code>, defined as shown, will always expand using the definition of <code class="code">BUFSIZE</code> that is currently in effect: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#define BUFSIZE 1020
#define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
#undef BUFSIZE
#define BUFSIZE 37</pre>
</div> <p>Now <code class="code">TABLESIZE</code> expands (in two stages) to <code class="code">37</code>. </p> <p>If the expansion of a macro contains its own name, either directly or via intermediate macros, it is not expanded again when the expansion is examined for more macros. This prevents infinite recursion. See <a class="xref" href="self_002dreferential-macros.html">Self-Referential Macros</a>, for the precise details. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
