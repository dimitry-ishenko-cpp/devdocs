Neither one is as portable as a wrapper ‘<samp class="samp">#ifndef</samp>’ and we recommend you do not use them in new programs, with the caveat that ‘<samp class="samp">#import</samp>’ is standard practice in Objective-C. </p>  <p>CPP supports a variant of ‘<samp class="samp">#include</samp>’ called ‘<samp class="samp">#import</samp>’ which includes a file, but does so at most once. If you use ‘<samp class="samp">#import</samp>’ instead of ‘<samp class="samp">#include</samp>’, then you don’t need the conditionals inside the header file to prevent multiple inclusion of the contents. ‘<samp class="samp">#import</samp>’ is standard in Objective-C, but is considered a deprecated extension in C and C++. </p> <p>‘<samp class="samp">#import</samp>’ is not a well designed feature. It requires the users of a header file to know that it should only be included once. It is much better for the header file’s implementor to write the file so that users don’t need to know this. Using a wrapper ‘<samp class="samp">#ifndef</samp>’ accomplishes this goal. </p> <p>In the present implementation, a single use of ‘<samp class="samp">#import</samp>’ will prevent the file from ever being read again, by either ‘<samp class="samp">#import</samp>’ or ‘<samp class="samp">#include</samp>’. You should not rely on this; do not use both ‘<samp class="samp">#import</samp>’ and ‘<samp class="samp">#include</samp>’ to refer to the same header file. </p> <p>Another way to prevent a header file from being included more than once is with the ‘<samp class="samp">#pragma once</samp>’ directive (see <a class="pxref" href="pragmas.html">Pragmas</a>). ‘<samp class="samp">#pragma once</samp>’ does not have the problems that ‘<samp class="samp">#import</samp>’ does, but it is not recognized by all preprocessors, so you cannot rely on it in a portable program. </p> </div>  <div class="nav-panel"> <p> Next: <a href="computed-includes.html">Computed Includes</a>, Previous: <a href="once-only-headers.html">Once-Only Headers</a>, Up: <a href="header-files.html">Header Files</a> [<a href="index.html#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-13.1.0/cpp/Index-of-Directives.html" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
