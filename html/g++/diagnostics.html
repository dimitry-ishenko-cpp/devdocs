<h1 class="chapter" id="Diagnostics-1">5 Diagnostics</h1> <div class="chapter-level-extent" id="Diagnostics">        <p>The directive ‘<samp class="samp">#error</samp>’ causes the preprocessor to report a fatal error. The tokens forming the rest of the line following ‘<samp class="samp">#error</samp>’ are used as the error message. </p> <p>You would use ‘<samp class="samp">#error</samp>’ inside of a conditional that detects a combination of parameters which you know the program does not properly support. For example, if you know that the program will not run properly on a VAX, you might write </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#ifdef __vax__
#error "Won't work on VAXen.  See comments at get_last_object."
#endif</pre></div>
</div> <p>If you have several configuration parameters that must be set up by the installation in a consistent way, you can use conditionals to detect an inconsistency and report it with ‘<samp class="samp">#error</samp>’. For example, </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#if !defined(FOO) &amp;&amp; defined(BAR)
#error "BAR requires FOO."
#endif</pre>
</div>  <p>The directive ‘<samp class="samp">#warning</samp>’ is like ‘<samp class="samp">#error</samp>’, but causes the preprocessor to issue a warning and continue preprocessing. The tokens following ‘<samp class="samp">#warning</samp>’ are used as the warning message. </p> <p>You might use ‘<samp class="samp">#warning</samp>’ in obsolete header files, with a message directing the user to the header file which should be used instead. </p> <p>Neither ‘<samp class="samp">#error</samp>’ nor ‘<samp class="samp">#warning</samp>’ macro-expands its argument. Internal whitespace sequences are each replaced with a single space. The line must consist of complete tokens. It is wisest to make the argument of these directives be a single string constant; this avoids problems with apostrophes and the like. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
