<h1 id="tutorial-user-guide">Tutorial - User Guide</h1> <p>This tutorial shows you how to use <strong>FastAPI</strong> with most of its features, step by step.</p> <p>Each section gradually builds on the previous ones, but it's structured to separate topics, so that you can go directly to any specific one to solve your specific API needs.</p> <p>It is also built to work as a future reference.</p> <p>So you can come back and see exactly what you need.</p> <h2 id="run-the-code">Run the code</h2> <p>All the code blocks can be copied and used directly (they are actually tested Python files).</p> <p>To run any of the examples, copy the code to a file <code>main.py</code>, and start <code>uvicorn</code> with:</p> <div class="termy"> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">$ uvicorn main:app --reload

&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;:     Started reloader process [28720]
&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;:     Started server process [28722]
&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;:     Waiting for application startup.
&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;:     Application startup complete.
</pre></div> </div> <p>It is <strong>HIGHLY encouraged</strong> that you write or copy the code, edit it and run it locally.</p> <p>Using it in your editor is what really shows you the benefits of FastAPI, seeing how little code you have to write, all the type checks, autocompletion, etc.</p> <hr> <h2 id="install-fastapi">Install FastAPI</h2> <p>The first step is to install FastAPI.</p> <p>For the tutorial, you might want to install it with all the optional dependencies and features:</p> <div class="termy"> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">$ pip install "fastapi[all]"

---&gt; 100%
</pre></div> </div> <p>...that also includes <code>uvicorn</code>, that you can use as the server that runs your code.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>You can also install it part by part.</p> <p>This is what you would probably do once you want to deploy your application to production:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">pip install fastapi
</pre></div> <p>Also install <code>uvicorn</code> to work as the server:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
</pre></div> <p>And the same for each of the optional dependencies that you want to use.</p> </div> <h2 id="advanced-user-guide">Advanced User Guide</h2> <p>There is also an <strong>Advanced User Guide</strong> that you can read later after this <strong>Tutorial - User guide</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>Advanced User Guide</strong>, builds on this, uses the same concepts, and teaches you some extra features.</p> <p>But you should first read the <strong>Tutorial - User Guide</strong> (what you are reading right now).</p> <p>It's designed so that you can build a complete application with just the <strong>Tutorial - User Guide</strong>, and then extend it in different ways, depending on your needs, using some of the additional ideas from the <strong>Advanced User Guide</strong>.</p><div class="_attribution">
