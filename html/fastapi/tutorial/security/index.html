<h1 id="security">Security</h1> <p>There are many ways to handle security, authentication and authorization.</p> <p>And it normally is a complex and "difficult" topic.</p> <p>In many frameworks and systems just handling security and authentication takes a big amount of effort and code (in many cases it can be 50% or more of all the code written).</p> <p><strong>FastAPI</strong> provides several tools to help you deal with <strong>Security</strong> easily, rapidly, in a standard way, without having to study and learn all the security specifications.</p> <p>But first, let's check some small concepts.</p> <h2 id="in-a-hurry">In a hurry?</h2> <p>If you don't care about any of these terms and you just need to add security with authentication based on username and password <em>right now</em>, skip to the next chapters.</p> <h2 id="oauth2">OAuth2</h2> <p>OAuth2 is a specification that defines several ways to handle authentication and authorization.</p> <p>It is quite an extensive specification and covers several complex use cases.</p> <p>It includes ways to authenticate using a "third party".</p> <p>That's what all the systems with "login with Facebook, Google, Twitter, GitHub" use underneath.</p> <h3 id="oauth-1">OAuth 1</h3> <p>There was an OAuth 1, which is very different from OAuth2, and more complex, as it included direct specifications on how to encrypt the communication.</p> <p>It is not very popular or used nowadays.</p> <p>OAuth2 doesn't specify how to encrypt the communication, it expects you to have your application served with HTTPS.</p> <div class="admonition tip"> <p class="admonition-title">Tip</p> <p>In the section about <strong>deployment</strong> you will see how to set up HTTPS for free, using Traefik and Let's Encrypt.</p> </div> <h2 id="openid-connect">OpenID Connect</h2> <p>OpenID Connect is another specification, based on <strong>OAuth2</strong>.</p> <p>It just extends OAuth2 specifying some things that are relatively ambiguous in OAuth2, to try to make it more interoperable.</p> <p>For example, Google login uses OpenID Connect (which underneath uses OAuth2).</p> <p>But Facebook login doesn't support OpenID Connect. It has its own flavor of OAuth2.</p> <h3 id="openid-not-openid-connect">OpenID (not "OpenID Connect")</h3> <p>There was also an "OpenID" specification. That tried to solve the same thing as <strong>OpenID Connect</strong>, but was not based on OAuth2.</p> <p>So, it was a complete additional system.</p> <p>It is not very popular or used nowadays.</p> <h2 id="openapi">OpenAPI</h2> <p>OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) is the open specification for building APIs (now part of the Linux Foundation).</p> <p><strong>FastAPI</strong> is based on <strong>OpenAPI</strong>.</p> <p>That's what makes it possible to have multiple automatic interactive documentation interfaces, code generation, etc.</p> <p>OpenAPI has a way to define multiple security "schemes".</p> <p>By using them, you can take advantage of all these standard-based tools, including these interactive documentation systems.</p> <p>OpenAPI defines the following security schemes:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>apiKey</code>: an application specific key that can come from:<ul> <li>A query parameter.</li> <li>A header.</li> <li>A cookie.</li> </ul> </li> <li>
<code>http</code>: standard HTTP authentication systems, including:<ul> <li>
<code>bearer</code>: a header <code>Authorization</code> with a value of <code>Bearer</code> plus a token. This is inherited from OAuth2.</li> <li>HTTP Basic authentication.</li> <li>HTTP Digest, etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li>
<code>oauth2</code>: all the OAuth2 ways to handle security (called "flows").<ul> <li>Several of these flows are appropriate for building an OAuth 2.0 authentication provider (like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc):<ul> <li><code>implicit</code></li> <li><code>clientCredentials</code></li> <li><code>authorizationCode</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>But there is one specific "flow" that can be perfectly used for handling authentication in the same application directly:<ul> <li>
<code>password</code>: some next chapters will cover examples of this.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>
<code>openIdConnect</code>: has a way to define how to discover OAuth2 authentication data automatically.<ul> <li>This automatic discovery is what is defined in the OpenID Connect specification.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <div class="admonition tip"> <p class="admonition-title">Tip</p> <p>Integrating other authentication/authorization providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc. is also possible and relatively easy.</p> <p>The most complex problem is building an authentication/authorization provider like those, but <strong>FastAPI</strong> gives you the tools to do it easily, while doing the heavy lifting for you.</p> </div> <h2 id="fastapi-utilities">
<strong>FastAPI</strong> utilities</h2> <p>FastAPI provides several tools for each of these security schemes in the <code>fastapi.security</code> module that simplify using these security mechanisms.</p> <p>In the next chapters you will see how to add security to your API using those tools provided by <strong>FastAPI</strong>.</p> <p>And you will also see how it gets automatically integrated into the interactive documentation system.</p> <form class="md-feedback" name="feedback" hidden> <fieldset> <legend class="md-feedback__title"> Was this page helpful? </legend> <div class="md-feedback__inner">  <div class="md-feedback__note"> <div data-md-value="1" hidden> Thanks for your feedback! </div> <div data-md-value="0" hidden> Thanks for your feedback! </div> </div> </div> </fieldset> </form><div class="_attribution">
