<h1 id="lifespan-events">Lifespan Events</h1> <p>You can define logic (code) that should be executed before the application <strong>starts up</strong>. This means that this code will be executed <strong>once</strong>, <strong>before</strong> the application <strong>starts receiving requests</strong>.</p> <p>The same way, you can define logic (code) that should be executed when the application is <strong>shutting down</strong>. In this case, this code will be executed <strong>once</strong>, <strong>after</strong> having handled possibly <strong>many requests</strong>.</p> <p>Because this code is executed before the application <strong>starts</strong> taking requests, and right after it <strong>finishes</strong> handling requests, it covers the whole application <strong>lifespan</strong> (the word "lifespan" will be important in a second ðŸ˜‰).</p> <p>This can be very useful for setting up <strong>resources</strong> that you need to use for the whole app, and that are <strong>shared</strong> among requests, and/or that you need to <strong>clean up</strong> afterwards. For example, a database connection pool, or loading a shared machine learning model.</p> <h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2> <p>Let's start with an example <strong>use case</strong> and then see how to solve it with this.</p> <p>Let's imagine that you have some <strong>machine learning models</strong> that you want to use to handle requests. ðŸ¤–</p> <p>The same models are shared among requests, so, it's not one model per request, or one per user or something similar.</p> <p>Let's imagine that loading the model can <strong>take quite some time</strong>, because it has to read a lot of <strong>data from disk</strong>. So you don't want to do it for every request.</p> <p>You could load it at the top level of the module/file, but that would also mean that it would <strong>load the model</strong> even if you are just running a simple automated test, then that test would be <strong>slow</strong> because it would have to wait for the model to load before being able to run an independent part of the code.</p> <p>That's what we'll solve, let's load the model before the requests are handled, but only right before the application starts receiving requests, not while the code is being loaded.</p> <h2 id="lifespan">Lifespan</h2> <p>You can define this <em>startup</em> and <em>shutdown</em> logic using the <code>lifespan</code> parameter of the <code>FastAPI</code> app, and a "context manager" (I'll show you what that is in a second).</p> <p>Let's start with an example and then see it in detail.</p> <p>We create an async function <code>lifespan()</code> with <code>yield</code> like this:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

</pre></div> <p>A <strong>context manager</strong> in Python is something that you can use in a <code>with</code> statement, for example, <code>open()</code> can be used as a context manager:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">with open("file.txt") as file:
    file.read()
</pre></div> <p>In recent versions of Python, there's also an <strong>async context manager</strong>. You would use it with <code>async with</code>:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">async with lifespan(app):
    await do_stuff()
</pre></div> <p>When you create a context manager or an async context manager like above, what it does is that, before entering the <code>with</code> block, it will execute the code before the <code>yield</code>, and after exiting the <code>with</code> block, it will execute the code after the <code>yield</code>.</p> <p>In our code example above, we don't use it directly, but we pass it to FastAPI for it to use it.</p> <p>The <code>lifespan</code> parameter of the <code>FastAPI</code> app takes an <strong>async context manager</strong>, so we can pass our new <code>lifespan</code> async context manager to it.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
