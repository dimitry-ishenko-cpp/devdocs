<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1> <p>Deploying a <strong>FastAPI</strong> application is relatively easy.</p> <h2 id="what-does-deployment-mean">What Does Deployment Mean</h2> <p>To <strong>deploy</strong> an application means to perform the necessary steps to make it <strong>available to the users</strong>.</p> <p>For a <strong>web API</strong>, it normally involves putting it in a <strong>remote machine</strong>, with a <strong>server program</strong> that provides good performance, stability, etc, so that your <strong>users</strong> can <strong>access</strong> the application efficiently and without interruptions or problems.</p> <p>This is in contrast to the <strong>development</strong> stages, where you are constantly changing the code, breaking it and fixing it, stopping and restarting the development server, etc.</p> <h2 id="deployment-strategies">Deployment Strategies</h2> <p>There are several ways to do it depending on your specific use case and the tools that you use.</p> <p>You could <strong>deploy a server</strong> yourself using a combination of tools, you could use a <strong>cloud service</strong> that does part of the work for you, or other possible options.</p> <p>I will show you some of the main concepts you should probably have in mind when deploying a <strong>FastAPI</strong> application (although most of it applies to any other type of web application).</p> <p>You will see more details to have in mind and some of the techniques to do it in the next sections. ✨</p><div class="_attribution">
