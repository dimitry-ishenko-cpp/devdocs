<h1 id="server-workers-gunicorn-with-uvicorn">Server Workers - Gunicorn with Uvicorn</h1> <p>Let's check back those deployment concepts from before:</p> <ul> <li>Security - HTTPS</li> <li>Running on startup</li> <li>Restarts</li> <li><strong>Replication (the number of processes running)</strong></li> <li>Memory</li> <li>Previous steps before starting</li> </ul> <p>Up to this point, with all the tutorials in the docs, you have probably been running a <strong>server program</strong> like Uvicorn, running a <strong>single process</strong>.</p> <p>When deploying applications you will probably want to have some <strong>replication of processes</strong> to take advantage of <strong>multiple cores</strong> and to be able to handle more requests.</p> <p>As you saw in the previous chapter about <a class="internal-link" href="../concepts/index.html" target="_blank">Deployment Concepts</a>, there are multiple strategies you can use.</p> <p>Here I'll show you how to use <a href="https://gunicorn.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>Gunicorn</strong></a> with <strong>Uvicorn worker processes</strong>.</p> <div class="admonition info"> <p class="admonition-title">Info</p> <p>If you are using containers, for example with Docker or Kubernetes, I'll tell you more about that in the next chapter: <a class="internal-link" href="../docker/index.html" target="_blank">FastAPI in Containers - Docker</a>.</p> <p>In particular, when running on <strong>Kubernetes</strong> you will probably <strong>not</strong> want to use Gunicorn and instead run <strong>a single Uvicorn process per container</strong>, but I'll tell you about it later in that chapter.</p> </div> <h2 id="gunicorn-with-uvicorn-workers">Gunicorn with Uvicorn Workers</h2> <p><strong>Gunicorn</strong> is mainly an application server using the <strong>WSGI standard</strong>. That means that Gunicorn can serve applications like Flask and Django. Gunicorn by itself is not compatible with <strong>FastAPI</strong>, as FastAPI uses the newest <strong><a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" class="external-link" target="_blank">ASGI standard</a></strong>.</p> <p>But Gunicorn supports working as a <strong>process manager</strong> and allowing users to tell it which specific <strong>worker process class</strong> to use. Then Gunicorn would start one or more <strong>worker processes</strong> using that class.</p> <p>And <strong>Uvicorn</strong> has a <strong>Gunicorn-compatible worker class</strong>.</p> <p>Using that combination, Gunicorn would act as a <strong>process manager</strong>, listening on the <strong>port</strong> and the <strong>IP</strong>. And it would <strong>transmit</strong> the communication to the worker processes running the <strong>Uvicorn class</strong>.</p> <p>And then the Gunicorn-compatible <strong>Uvicorn worker</strong> class would be in charge of converting the data sent by Gunicorn to the ASGI standard for FastAPI to use it.</p> <h2 id="install-gunicorn-and-uvicorn">Install Gunicorn and Uvicorn</h2> <div class="termy"> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">$ pip install "uvicorn[standard]" gunicorn

---&gt; 100%
</pre></div> </div> <p>That will install both Uvicorn with the <code>standard</code> extra packages (to get high performance) and Gunicorn.</p> <h2 id="run-gunicorn-with-uvicorn-workers">Run Gunicorn with Uvicorn Workers</h2> <p>Then you can run Gunicorn with:</p> <div class="termy"> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">$ gunicorn main:app --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:80

</pre></div> </div> <p>Let's see what each of those options mean:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>main:app</code>: This is the same syntax used by Uvicorn, <code>main</code> means the Python module named "<code>main</code>", so, a file <code>main.py</code>. And <code>app</code> is the name of the variable that is the <strong>FastAPI</strong> application.</p> <ul> <li> <p>You can imagine that <code>main:app</code> is equivalent to a Python <code>import</code> statement like:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">from main import app
</pre></div> </li> <li> <p>So, the colon in <code>main:app</code> would be equivalent to the Python <code>import</code> part in <code>from main import app</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><code>--workers</code>: The number of worker processes to use, each will run a Uvicorn worker, in this case, 4 workers.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>--worker-class</code>: The Gunicorn-compatible worker class to use in the worker processes.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Here we pass the class that Gunicorn can import and use with:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">import uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker
</pre></div> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><code>--bind</code>: This tells Gunicorn the IP and the port to listen to, using a colon (<code>:</code>) to separate the IP and the port.</p> <ul> <li>If you were running Uvicorn directly, instead of <code>--bind 0.0.0.0:80</code> (the Gunicorn option) you would use <code>--host 0.0.0.0</code> and <code>--port 80</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>In the output, you can see that it shows the <strong>PID</strong> (process ID) of each process (it's just a number).</p> <p>You can see that:</p> <ul> <li>The Gunicorn <strong>process manager</strong> starts with PID <code>19499</code> (in your case it will be a different number).</li> <li>Then it starts <code>Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:80</code>.</li> <li>Then it detects that it has to use the worker class at <code>uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker</code>.</li> <li>And then it starts <strong>4 workers</strong>, each with its own PID: <code>19511</code>, <code>19513</code>, <code>19514</code>, and <code>19515</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Gunicorn would also take care of managing <strong>dead processes</strong> and <strong>restarting</strong> new ones if needed to keep the number of workers. So that helps in part with the <strong>restart</strong> concept from the list above.</p> <p>Nevertheless, you would probably also want to have something outside making sure to <strong>restart Gunicorn</strong> if necessary, and also to <strong>run it on startup</strong>, etc.</p> <h2 id="uvicorn-with-workers">Uvicorn with Workers</h2> <p>Uvicorn also has an option to start and run several <strong>worker processes</strong>.</p> <p>Nevertheless, as of now, Uvicorn's capabilities for handling worker processes are more limited than Gunicorn's. So, if you want to have a process manager at this level (at the Python level), then it might be better to try with Gunicorn as the process manager.</p> <p>In any case, you would run it like this:</p> <div class="termy"> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">$ uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --workers 4
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Uvicorn running on &lt;b&gt;http://0.0.0.0:8080&lt;/b&gt; (Press CTRL+C to quit)
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Started parent process [&lt;font color="#A1EFE4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;27365&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Started server process [&lt;font color="#A1EFE4"&gt;27368&lt;/font&gt;]
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Waiting for application startup.
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Application startup complete.
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Started server process [&lt;font color="#A1EFE4"&gt;27369&lt;/font&gt;]
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Waiting for application startup.
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Application startup complete.
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Started server process [&lt;font color="#A1EFE4"&gt;27370&lt;/font&gt;]
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Waiting for application startup.
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Application startup complete.
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Started server process [&lt;font color="#A1EFE4"&gt;27367&lt;/font&gt;]
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Waiting for application startup.
&lt;font color="#A6E22E"&gt;INFO&lt;/font&gt;:     Application startup complete.
</pre></div> </div> <p>The only new option here is <code>--workers</code> telling Uvicorn to start 4 worker processes.</p> <p>You can also see that it shows the <strong>PID</strong> of each process, <code>27365</code> for the parent process (this is the <strong>process manager</strong>) and one for each worker process: <code>27368</code>, <code>27369</code>, <code>27370</code>, and <code>27367</code>.</p> <h2 id="deployment-concepts">Deployment Concepts</h2> <p>Here you saw how to use <strong>Gunicorn</strong> (or Uvicorn) managing <strong>Uvicorn worker processes</strong> to <strong>parallelize</strong> the execution of the application, take advantage of <strong>multiple cores</strong> in the CPU, and be able to serve <strong>more requests</strong>.</p> <p>From the list of deployment concepts from above, using workers would mainly help with the <strong>replication</strong> part, and a little bit with the <strong>restarts</strong>, but you still need to take care of the others:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Security - HTTPS</strong></li> <li><strong>Running on startup</strong></li> <li><strong><em>Restarts</em></strong></li> <li>Replication (the number of processes running)</li> <li><strong>Memory</strong></li> <li><strong>Previous steps before starting</strong></li> </ul> <h2 id="containers-and-docker">Containers and Docker</h2> <p>In the next chapter about <a class="internal-link" href="../docker/index.html" target="_blank">FastAPI in Containers - Docker</a> I'll tell some strategies you could use to handle the other <strong>deployment concepts</strong>.</p> <p>I'll also show you the <strong>official Docker image</strong> that includes <strong>Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers</strong> and some default configurations that can be useful for simple cases.</p> <p>There I'll also show you how to <strong>build your own image from scratch</strong> to run a single Uvicorn process (without Gunicorn). It is a simple process and is probably what you would want to do when using a distributed container management system like <strong>Kubernetes</strong>.</p> <h2 id="recap">Recap</h2> <p>You can use <strong>Gunicorn</strong> (or also Uvicorn) as a process manager with Uvicorn workers to take advantage of <strong>multi-core CPUs</strong>, to run <strong>multiple processes in parallel</strong>.</p> <p>You could use these tools and ideas if you are setting up <strong>your own deployment system</strong> while taking care of the other deployment concepts yourself.</p> <p>Check out the next chapter to learn about <strong>FastAPI</strong> with containers (e.g. Docker and Kubernetes). You will see that those tools have simple ways to solve the other <strong>deployment concepts</strong> as well. ✨</p><div class="_attribution">
