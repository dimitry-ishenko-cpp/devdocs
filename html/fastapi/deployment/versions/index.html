<h1 id="about-fastapi-versions">About FastAPI versions</h1> <p><strong>FastAPI</strong> is already being used in production in many applications and systems. And the test coverage is kept at 100%. But its development is still moving quickly.</p> <p>New features are added frequently, bugs are fixed regularly, and the code is still continuously improving.</p> <p>That's why the current versions are still <code>0.x.x</code>, this reflects that each version could potentially have breaking changes. This follows the <a href="https://semver.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a> conventions.</p> <p>You can create production applications with <strong>FastAPI</strong> right now (and you have probably been doing it for some time), you just have to make sure that you use a version that works correctly with the rest of your code.</p> <h2 id="pin-your-fastapi-version">Pin your <code>fastapi</code> version</h2> <p>The first thing you should do is to "pin" the version of <strong>FastAPI</strong> you are using to the specific latest version that you know works correctly for your application.</p> <p>For example, let's say you are using version <code>0.112.0</code> in your app.</p> <p>If you use a <code>requirements.txt</code> file you could specify the version with:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">fastapi[standard]==0.112.0
</pre></div> <p>that would mean that you would use exactly the version <code>0.112.0</code>.</p> <p>Or you could also pin it with:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">fastapi[standard]&gt;=0.112.0,&lt;0.113.0
</pre></div> <p>that would mean that you would use the versions <code>0.112.0</code> or above, but less than <code>0.113.0</code>, for example, a version <code>0.112.2</code> would still be accepted.</p> <p>If you use any other tool to manage your installations, like <code>uv</code>, Poetry, Pipenv, or others, they all have a way that you can use to define specific versions for your packages.</p> <h2 id="available-versions">Available versions</h2> <p>You can see the available versions (e.g. to check what is the current latest) in the <a class="internal-link" data-preview="" href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/" target="_blank">Release Notes</a>.</p> <h2 id="about-versions">About versions</h2> <p>Following the Semantic Versioning conventions, any version below <code>1.0.0</code> could potentially add breaking changes.</p> <p>FastAPI also follows the convention that any "PATCH" version change is for bug fixes and non-breaking changes.</p> <div class="admonition tip"> <p class="admonition-title">Tip</p> <p>The "PATCH" is the last number, for example, in <code>0.2.3</code>, the PATCH version is <code>3</code>.</p> </div> <p>So, you should be able to pin to a version like:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">fastapi&gt;=0.45.0,&lt;0.46.0
</pre></div> <p>Breaking changes and new features are added in "MINOR" versions.</p> <div class="admonition tip"> <p class="admonition-title">Tip</p> <p>The "MINOR" is the number in the middle, for example, in <code>0.2.3</code>, the MINOR version is <code>2</code>.</p> </div> <h2 id="upgrading-the-fastapi-versions">Upgrading the FastAPI versions</h2> <p>You should add tests for your app.</p> <p>With <strong>FastAPI</strong> it's very easy (thanks to Starlette), check the docs: <a class="internal-link" data-preview="" href="../../tutorial/testing/index.html" target="_blank">Testing</a></p> <p>After you have tests, then you can upgrade the <strong>FastAPI</strong> version to a more recent one, and make sure that all your code is working correctly by running your tests.</p> <p>If everything is working, or after you make the necessary changes, and all your tests are passing, then you can pin your <code>fastapi</code> to that new recent version.</p> <h2 id="about-starlette">About Starlette</h2> <p>You shouldn't pin the version of <code>starlette</code>.</p> <p>Different versions of <strong>FastAPI</strong> will use a specific newer version of Starlette.</p> <p>So, you can just let <strong>FastAPI</strong> use the correct Starlette version.</p> <h2 id="about-pydantic">About Pydantic</h2> <p>Pydantic includes the tests for <strong>FastAPI</strong> with its own tests, so new versions of Pydantic (above <code>1.0.0</code>) are always compatible with FastAPI.</p> <p>You can pin Pydantic to any version above <code>1.0.0</code> that works for you.</p> <p>For example:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="language-python" data-language="python">pydantic&gt;=2.7.0,&lt;3.0.0
