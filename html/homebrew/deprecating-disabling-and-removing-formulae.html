<h1 id="deprecating-disabling-and-removing-formulae">Deprecating, Disabling, and Removing Formulae</h1> <p>There are many reasons why formulae may be deprecated, disabled, or removed. This document explains the differences between each method as well as explaining when one method should be used over another.</p> <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2> <p>This general rule of thumb can be followed:</p> <ul> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deprecate!</code> should be used for formulae that <em>should</em> no longer be used.</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disable!</code> should be used for formulae that <em>cannot</em> be used.</li> <li>Formulae that are no longer acceptable in homebrew/core or have been disabled for over a year should be removed.</li> </ul> <h2 id="deprecation">Deprecation</h2> <p>If a user attempts to install a deprecated formula, they will be shown a warning message but the install will proceed.</p> <p>A formula should be deprecated to indicate to users that the formula should not be used and will be disabled in the future. Deprecated formulae should be maintained by the Homebrew maintainers so they can still build from source and their bottles continue to work (even if unmaintained upstream). If this is not possible, they should be disabled.</p> <p>The most common reasons for deprecation are when the upstream project is deprecated, unmaintained, or archived.</p> <p>Formulae with dependents may be deprecated only if at least one of the following are true:</p> <ul> <li>its dependents are all deprecated</li> <li>the formula does not build on any of our supported macOS versions and on Linux</li> <li>the formula has outstanding CVEs</li> </ul> <p>To deprecate a formula, add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deprecate!</code> call. This call should include a deprecation date (in the ISO 8601 format) and a deprecation reason:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">deprecate! date: "YYYY-MM-DD", because: :reason</pre> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> parameter should be set to the date that the project or version became (or will become) deprecated. If there is no clear date but the formula needs to be deprecated, use today’s date. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> parameter is set to a date in the future, the formula will not become deprecated until that date. This can be useful if the upstream developers have indicated a date where the project or version will stop being supported.</p> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">because</code> parameter can be a preset reason (using a symbol) or a custom reason. See the <a href="#deprecate-and-disable-reasons">Deprecate and Disable Reasons</a> section below for more details about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">because</code> parameter.</p> <h2 id="disabling">Disabling</h2> <p>If a user attempts to install a disabled formula, they will be shown an error message and the install will fail.</p> <p>A formula should be disabled to indicate to users that the formula cannot be used and will be removed in the future. Disabled formulae may no longer build from source or have working bottles.</p> <p>The most common reasons for disabling a formula are:</p> <ul> <li>it cannot be built from source (meaning no bottles can be built)</li> <li>it has been deprecated for a long time</li> <li>the upstream repository has been removed</li> <li>the project has no license</li> </ul> <p>Formulae should not be disabled without a deprecation period of at least three months unless the circumstances are exceptional (e.g. the formula does not build on any supported macOS version or Linux). Popular formulae should have longer deprecation periods. The popularity of a formula should be based on our analytics data.</p> <p><strong>Note: disabled formulae in homebrew/core will be automatically removed one year after their disable date</strong></p> <p>To disable a formula, add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disable!</code> call. This call should include a deprecation date (in the ISO 8601 format) and a deprecation reason:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">disable! date: "YYYY-MM-DD", because: :reason</pre> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> parameter should be set to the date that the reason for disabling came into effect. If there is no clear date but the formula needs to be disabled, use today’s date. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> parameter is set to a date in the future, the formula will be deprecated until that date (on which the formula will become disabled).</p> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">because</code> parameter can be a preset reason (using a symbol) or a custom reason. See the <a href="#deprecate-and-disable-reasons">Deprecate and Disable Reasons</a> section below for more details about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">because</code> parameter.</p> <h2 id="removal">Removal</h2> <p>A formula should be removed if it does not meet our criteria for <a href="acceptable-formulae.html">acceptable formulae</a> or <a href="versions.html">versioned formulae</a>, has a non-open-source license, or has been disabled for over a year.</p> <h2 id="deprecate-and-disable-reasons">Deprecate and Disable Reasons</h2> <p>When a formula is deprecated or disabled, a reason explaining the action must be provided.</p> <p>There are two ways to indicate the reason. The preferred way is to use a pre-existing symbol to indicate the reason. The available symbols are listed below and can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/deprecate_disable.rb"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DeprecateDisable</code> module</a>:</p> <ul> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:does_not_build</code>: the formula cannot be built from source</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:no_license</code>: the formula does not have a license</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:repo_archived</code>: the upstream repository has been archived</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:repo_removed</code>: the upstream repository has been removed</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:unmaintained</code>: the project appears to be abandoned</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:unsupported</code>: Homebrew’s application of the software is not supported by the upstream developers (e.g. upstream only supports macOS versions prior to 10.14)</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:deprecated_upstream</code>: the project is deprecated upstream</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:versioned_formula</code>: the formula is a versioned formula</li> </ul> <p>These reasons can be specified by their symbols (the comments show the message that will be displayed to users):</p> <pre data-language="ruby"># Warning: &lt;formula&gt; has been deprecated because it is deprecated upstream!
deprecate! date: "2020-01-01", because: :deprecated_upstream</pre> <pre data-language="ruby"># Error: &lt;formula&gt; has been disabled because it does not build!
disable! date: "2020-01-01", because: :does_not_build</pre> <p>If these pre-existing reasons do not fit, a custom reason can be specified. These reasons should be written to fit into the sentence <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;formula&gt; has been deprecated/disabled because it &lt;reason&gt;!</code>.</p> <p>A well-worded example of a custom reason would be:</p> <pre data-language="ruby"># Warning: &lt;formula&gt; has been deprecated because it fetches unversioned dependencies at runtime!
deprecate! date: "2020-01-01", because: "fetches unversioned dependencies at runtime"</pre> <p>A poorly-worded example of a custom reason would be:</p> <pre data-language="ruby"># Error: &lt;formula&gt; has been disabled because it invalid license!
disable! date: "2020-01-01", because: "invalid license"</pre><div class="_attribution">
