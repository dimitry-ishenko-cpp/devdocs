<h1 id="migrating-a-formula-to-a-tap">Migrating A Formula To A Tap</h1> <p>There are times when we may wish to migrate a formula from one tap into another tap. To do this:</p> <ol> <li>Create a pull request to the new tap adding the formula file as-is from the original tap. Fix any test failures that may occur due to the stricter requirements for new formulae than existing formula (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew audit --strict</code> must pass for that formula).</li> <li>Create a pull request to the original tap deleting the formula file and add it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tap_migrations.json</code> with a commit message like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gv: migrate to homebrew/core</code>.</li> <li>Put a link for each pull request in the other pull request so the maintainers can merge them both at once.</li> </ol> <p>Congratulations, youâ€™ve moved a formula to a tap!</p> <p>For Homebrew maintainers, formulae should only ever be migrated into and within the Homebrew organisation (e.g. from Homebrew/core to Homebrew/cask, or from a third-party tap to Homebrew/core), and never out of it.</p><div class="_attribution">
