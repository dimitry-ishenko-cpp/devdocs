<h1 id="md5-and-sha-1-deprecation">MD5 and SHA-1 Deprecation</h1> <p>In early 2015 Homebrew started the process of deprecating <em>SHA1</em> for package integrity verification. Since then formulae under the Homebrew organisation have been migrated to use <em>SHA256</em> for verification; this includes both source packages and our precompiled packages (bottles).</p> <p>Homebrew has since stopped supporting <em>SHA1</em> and <em>MD5</em> entirely. <em>MD5</em> checksums were removed from core formulae in 2012 and as of April 2015 installing a formula verified by <em>MD5</em> is actively blocked.</p> <p>We removed <em>SHA1</em> support in <strong>November 2016</strong>, 21 months after we started warning people to move away from it for verification. This is enforced in the same way <em>MD5</em> is, by blocking the installation of that individual formula until the checksum is migrated.</p> <p>This means custom taps, local custom formulae, etc. need to be migrated to use <em>SHA256</em> before you can install them.</p><div class="_attribution">
