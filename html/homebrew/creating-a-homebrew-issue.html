Next, go through the steps in the <a href="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting guide</a>.</p> <p>If the preceding steps did not help, it may be appropriate to submit an issue. This can be done by navigating to the relevant repository, clicking the “Issues” link, and clicking on the “New issue” button. When creating an issue, make sure you use the provided template, as it’s important in helping others to understand and potentially triage your issue efficiently.</p><div class="_attribution">
