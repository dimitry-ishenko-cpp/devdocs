<h1 id="c-standard-libraries">C++ Standard Libraries</h1> <p>There are two C++ standard libraries supported by Apple compilers.</p> <p>The default for 10.9 and later is <strong>libc++</strong>, which is also the default for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang</code> on older platforms when building C++11 code.</p> <p>The default for 10.8 and earlier was <strong>libstdc++</strong>, supported by Apple GCC compilers, GNU GCC compilers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang</code>. This was marked deprecated with a warning during compilation as of Xcode 8.</p> <p>There are subtle incompatibilities between several of the C++ standard libraries, so Homebrew will refuse to install software if a dependency was built with an incompatible C++ library. It’s recommended that you install the dependency tree using a compatible compiler.</p> <p><strong>If you’ve upgraded to 10.9 or later from an earlier version:</strong> Because the default C++ standard library is now libc++, you may not be able to build software using dependencies that you built on 10.8 or earlier. If you’re reading this page because you were directed here by a build error, you can most likely fix the issue if you reinstall all the dependencies of the package you’re trying to build.</p> <p>Example install using GCC 7:</p> <pre data-language="bash">brew install gcc@7
brew install --cc=gcc-7 &lt;formula&gt;</pre><div class="_attribution">
