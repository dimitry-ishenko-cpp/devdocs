<h1 id="acceptable-formulae">Acceptable Formulae</h1> <p>Some formulae should not go in <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">homebrew/core</a>. But there are additional <a href="interesting-taps-and-forks.html">Interesting Taps and Forks</a> and anyone can start their own!</p> <h3 id="supported-platforms-in-homebrewcore">Supported platforms in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homebrew/core</code>
</h3> <p>The formula needs to build and pass tests on the latest 3 supported macOS versions (<a href="installation.html#macos-requirements">x86_64 and Apple Silicon/ARM</a>) and on x86_64 <a href="linux-ci.html">Linux</a>. Please have a look at the continuous integration jobs on a pull request in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homebrew/core</code> to see the full list of OSs. If upstream does not support one of these platforms, an exception can be made and the formula can be disabled for that platform.</p> <h3 id="dupes-in-homebrewcore">Dupes in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homebrew/core</code>
</h3> <p>We now accept stuff that comes with macOS as long as it uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keg_only :provided_by_macos</code> to be keg-only by default.</p> <h3 id="versioned-formulae-in-homebrewcore">Versioned formulae in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homebrew/core</code>
</h3> <p>We now accept versioned formulae as long as they <a href="versions.html">meet the requirements</a>.</p> <h3 id="we-dont-like-tools-that-upgrade-themselves">We don’t like tools that upgrade themselves</h3> <p>Software that can upgrade itself does not integrate well with Homebrew’s own upgrade functionality. The self-update functionality should be disabled (while minimising complication to the formula).</p> <h3 id="we-dont-like-install-scripts-that-download-unversioned-things">We don’t like install scripts that download unversioned things</h3> <p>We don’t like install scripts that are pulling from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch of Git repositories or unversioned, unchecksummed tarballs. These should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resource</code> blocks with specific revisions or checksummed tarballs instead. Note that we now allow tools like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cargo</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip</code> to download specifically versioned libraries during installation.</p> <h3 id="we-dont-like-binary-formulae">We don’t like binary formulae</h3> <p>Our policy is that formulae in the core tap (<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">homebrew/core</a>) must be open-source with an <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses">Debian Free Software Guidelines license</a> and either built from source or produce cross-platform binaries (e.g. Java, Mono). Binary-only formulae should go to <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask">homebrew/cask</a>.</p> <p>Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">homebrew/core</a> formulae must also not depend on casks or any other proprietary software.</p> <p>This includes automatic installation of casks at runtime.</p> <h3 id="stable-versions">Stable versions</h3> <p>Formulae in the core repository must have a stable version tagged by the upstream project. Tarballs are preferred to Git checkouts, and tarballs should include the version in the filename whenever possible.</p> <p>We don’t accept software without a tagged version because they regularly break due to upstream changes and we can’t provide <a href="bottles.html">bottles</a> for them.</p> <h3 id="niche-or-self-submitted-stuff">Niche (or self-submitted) stuff</h3> <p>The software in question must:</p> <ul> <li>be maintained (i.e. the last release wasn’t ages ago, it works without patching on all Homebrew-supported OS versions and has no outstanding, unpatched security vulnerabilities)</li> <li>be known</li> <li>be stable (e.g. not declared “unstable” or “beta” by upstream)</li> <li>be used</li> <li>have a homepage</li> </ul> <p>We will reject formulae that seem too obscure, partly because they won’t get maintained and partly because we have to draw the line somewhere.</p> <p>We frown on authors submitting their own work unless it is very popular.</p> <p>Don’t forget Homebrew is all Git underneath! <a href="how-to-create-and-maintain-a-tap.html">Maintain your own tap</a> if you have to!</p> <p>There may be exceptions to these rules in the main repository; we may include things that don’t meet these criteria or reject things that do. Please trust that we need to use our discretion based on our experience running a package manager.</p> <h3 id="stuff-that-builds-an-app">Stuff that builds an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code>
</h3> <p>Don’t make your formula build an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> (native macOS Application); we don’t want those things in Homebrew. Encourage upstream projects to build and support a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> that can be distributed by <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask">homebrew/cask</a> (and used without it, too).</p> <h3 id="stuff-that-builds-a-gui-by-default-but-doesnt-have-to">Stuff that builds a GUI by default (but doesn’t have to)</h3> <p>Make it build a command-line tool or a library by default and, if the GUI is useful and would be widely used, also build the GUI. Don’t build X11/XQuartz GUIs as they are a bad user experience on macOS.</p> <h3 id="stuff-that-doesnt-build-with-the-latest-stable-xcode-clang">Stuff that doesn’t build with the latest, stable Xcode Clang</h3> <p>Clang is the default C/C++ compiler on macOS (and has been for a long time). Software that doesn’t build with it hasn’t been adequately ported to macOS.</p> <h3 id="stuff-that-requires-heavy-manual-prepost-install-intervention">Stuff that requires heavy manual pre/post-install intervention</h3> <p>We’re a package manager so we want to do things like resolve dependencies and set up applications for our users. If things require too much manual intervention then they aren’t useful in a package manager.</p> <h2 id="stuff-that-requires-vendored-versions-of-homebrew-formulae">Stuff that requires vendored versions of Homebrew formulae</h2> <p>Homebrew formulae should avoid having multiple, separate, upstream projects bundled together in a single package to avoid shipping outdated/insecure versions of software that is already a formula. Veracode’s <a href="https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/announcing-state-software-security-v11-open-source-edition">State of Software Security report</a> concludes</p> <blockquote> <p>In fact, 79% of the time, developers never update third-party libraries after including them in a codebase.</p> </blockquote> <p>For more info see <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#s-embeddedfiles">Debian’s</a> and <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#bundling">Fedora’s</a> stances on this.</p> <h3 id="sometimes-there-are-exceptions">Sometimes there are exceptions</h3> <p>Even if all criteria are met we may not accept the formula. Documentation tends to lag behind current decision-making. Although some rejections may seem arbitrary or strange they are based on years of experience making Homebrew work acceptably for our users.</p><div class="_attribution">
