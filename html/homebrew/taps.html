<h1 id="taps-third-party-repositories">Taps (Third-Party Repositories)</h1> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> command adds more repositories to the list of formulae that Homebrew tracks, updates, and installs from. By default, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tap</code> assumes that the repositories come from GitHub, but the command isn’t limited to any one location.</p> <h2 id="the-brew-tap-command">The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> command</h2> <ul> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> without arguments lists all currently tapped repositories. For example:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ brew tap
homebrew/cask
homebrew/core
petere/postgresql</pre> </li> </ul>   <ul> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap &lt;user/repo&gt;</code> makes a clone of the repository at <em>https://github.com/&lt;user&gt;/homebrew-&lt;repo&gt;</em> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(brew --repository)/Library/Taps</code>. After that, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew</code> will be able to work with those formulae as if they were in Homebrew’s <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">homebrew/core</a> canonical repository. You can install and uninstall them with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew [un]install</code>, and the formulae are automatically updated when you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew update</code>. (See below for details about how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> handles the names of repositories.)</li> </ul>  <ul> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap &lt;user/repo&gt; &lt;URL&gt;</code> makes a clone of the repository at <em>URL</em>. Unlike the one-argument version, <em>URL</em> is not assumed to be GitHub, and it doesn’t have to be HTTP. Any location and any protocol that Git can handle is fine, although non-GitHub taps require running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap --force-auto-update &lt;user/repo&gt;</code> to enable automatic updating.</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap --repair</code> migrates tapped formulae from a symlink-based to directory-based structure. (This should only need to be run once.)</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew untap user/repo [user/repo user/repo ...]</code> removes the given taps. The repositories are deleted and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew</code> will no longer be aware of their formulae. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew untap</code> can handle multiple removals at once.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="repository-naming-conventions-and-assumptions">Repository naming conventions and assumptions</h2> <p>On GitHub, your repository must be named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homebrew-something</code> to use the one-argument form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code>. The prefix “homebrew-“ is not optional. (The two-argument form doesn’t have this limitation, but it forces you to give the full URL explicitly.)</p> <p>When you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> on the command line, however, you can leave out the “homebrew-“ prefix in commands. That is, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap username/foobar</code> can be used as a shortcut for the long version: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew tap username/homebrew-foobar</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew</code> will automatically add back the “homebrew-“ prefix whenever it’s necessary.</p> <h2 id="formula-with-duplicate-names">Formula with duplicate names</h2> <p>If your tap contains a formula that is also present in <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">homebrew/core</a>, that’s fine, but you would need to specify its fully qualified name in the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;user&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/&lt;formula&gt;</code> to install your version.</p> <p>Whenever a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install foo</code> command is issued, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew</code> selects which formula to use by searching in the following order:</p> <ul> <li>core formulae</li> <li>other taps</li> </ul> <p>If you need a formula to be installed from a particular tap, you can use fully qualified names to refer to them.</p> <p>If you were to create a tap for an alternative <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> formula, the behaviour would be:</p> <pre data-language="bash">brew install vim                     # installs from homebrew/core
brew install username/repo/vim       # installs from your custom repository</pre> <p>As a result, we recommend you give new names to customized formulae if you want to make them easier to install. Note that there is (intentionally) no way of replacing dependencies of core formulae with those from other taps.</p><div class="_attribution">
