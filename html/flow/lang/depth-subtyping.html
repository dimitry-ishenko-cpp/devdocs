<h1>Depth Subtyping</h1> <p>Assume we have two classes, which have a subtype relationship:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">class Person { name: string }
class Employee extends Person { department: string }
</pre> <p>It’s valid to use an <code>Employee</code> instance where a <code>Person</code> instance is expected.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">// @flow
class Person { name: string }
class Employee extends Person { department: string }

var employee: Employee = new Employee;
var person: Person = employee; // OK
</pre> <p>However, it is not valid to use an object containing an <code>Employee</code> instance where an object containing a <code>Person</code> instance is expected.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">// @flow
class Person { name: string }
class Employee extends Person { department: string }

var employee: { who: Employee } = { who: new Employee };
// $ExpectError
var person: { who: Person } = employee; // Error
</pre> <p>This is an error because objects are mutable. The value referenced by the <code>employee</code> variable is the same as the value referenced by the <code>person</code> variable.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">person.who = new Person;
</pre> <p>If we write into the <code>who</code> property of the <code>person</code> object, we’ve also changed the value of <code>employee.who</code>, which is explicitly annotated to be an <code>Employee</code> instance.</p> <p>If we prevented any code from ever writing a new value to the object through the <code>person</code> variable, it would be safe to use the <code>employee</code> variable. Flow provides a syntax for this:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">// @flow
class Person { name: string }
class Employee extends Person { department: string }

var employee: { who: Employee } = { who: new Employee };
var person: { +who: Person } = employee; // OK
// $ExpectError
person.who = new Person; // Error!
</pre> <p>The plus sign indicates that the <code>who</code> property is “covariant.” Using a covariant property allows us to use objects which have subtype-compatible values for that property. By default, object properties are invariant, which allow both reads and writes, but are more restrictive in the values they accept.</p> <p>Read more about <a href="variance.html">property variance</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
