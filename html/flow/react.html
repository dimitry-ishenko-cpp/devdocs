<h1>Getting Started</h1> <p>Developers will often use Flow and React together, so it is important that Flow can effectively type both common and advanced React patterns. This guide will teach you how to use Flow to create safer React applications.</p> <p>In this guide we will assume you know <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html">the React basics</a> and focus on adding types for patterns you are already familiar with. We will be using examples based on <code>react-dom</code>, but all of these patterns work in other environments like <code>react-native</code> as well.</p> <h2 id="toc-setup-flow-with-react">Setup Flow with React </h2> <p>Flow and Babel work well together, so it doesnâ€™t take much to adopt Flow as a React user who already uses Babel. If you need to setup Babel with Flow, you can follow <a href="https://flow.org/en/tools/babel/">this guide</a>.</p> <p>Babel also <a href="https://flow.org/en/tools/create-react-app/">works out of the box with Create React App</a>, just install Flow and create a <code>.flowconfig</code>.</p> <h2 id="react-runtimes">React Runtimes</h2> <p>Flow supports the <code>@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx</code> runtime options required to use JSX without explicitly importing the React namespace.</p> <p>If you are using the new automatic runtime, use this configuration in your <code>.flowconfig</code> so that Flow knows to auto-import <code>jsx</code>:</p> <pre data-language="ini">[options]
