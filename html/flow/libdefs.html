<h1>Library Definitions</h1> <h2 id="toc-what-s-a-library-definition">What’s a “Library Definition”? </h2> <p>Most real JavaScript programs depend on third-party code and not just code immediately under the control of the project. That means a project using Flow may need to reference outside code that either doesn’t have type information or doesn’t have accurate and/or precise type information. In order to handle this, Flow supports the concept of a “library definition” (AKA “libdef”).</p> <p>A libdef is a special file that informs Flow about the type signature of some specific third-party module or package of modules that your application uses. If you’re familiar with languages that have header files (like <code>C++</code>), you can think of libdefs as a similar concept.</p> <p>These special files use the same <code>.js</code> extension as normal JS code, but they are placed in a directory called <code>flow-typed</code> in the root directory of your project. Placement in this directory tells Flow to interpret them as libdefs rather than normal JS files.</p> <blockquote> <p>NOTE: Using the <code>/flow-typed</code> directory for libdefs is a convention that enables Flow to JustWork™ out of the box and encourages consistency across projects that use Flow, but it is also possible to explicitly configure Flow to look elsewhere for libdefs using the <a href="https://flow.org/en/config/libs"><code>[libs]</code> section of your <code>.flowconfig</code></a>.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="toc-general-best-practices">General Best Practices </h2> <p><strong>Try to provide a libdef for each third-party library your project uses</strong></p> <p>If a third-party library that has no type information is used by your project, Flow will treat it like any other untyped dependency and mark all of its exports as <code>any</code>. Interestingly, this is the only place that Flow will implicitly inject <code>any</code> into your program.</p> <p>Because of this behavior, it is a best practice to find or write libdefs for as many of the third-party libraries that you use as you can. We recommend checking out the <code>flow-typed</code> <a href="https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/blob/master/README.md">tool and repository</a> , which helps you quickly find and install pre-existing libdefs for your third-party dependencies.</p><div class="_attribution">
