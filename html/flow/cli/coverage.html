<h1>Flow Coverage</h1> <p>The coverage command provides a metric of the amount of checking that Flow has performed on each part of your code. A program with high Flow coverage should increase your confidence that Flow has detected any potential runtime errors.</p> <p>The determining factor for this is the presence of <a href="../types/any.html"><code>any</code></a> in the inferred type of each expression. An expression whose inferred type is <code>any</code> is considered <em>uncovered</em>, otherwise it is considered <em>covered</em>.</p> <p>To see why this metric was chosen for determining Flow’s effectiveness, consider the example</p> <pre data-language="javascript">const one: any = 1;
one();
</pre> <p>This code leads to a runtime type error, since we are attempting to perform a call on a number. Flow, however, does not flag an error here, because we have annotated variable <code>one</code> as <code>any</code>. Flow’s checking is effectively turned off whenever <code>any</code> is involved, so it will silently allow the call. The use of this <em>unsafe</em> type has rendered the type checker ineffective, and the coverage metric is here to surface this, by reporting all instances of <code>one</code> as uncovered.</p> <h2 id="toc-design-space">Design Space </h2> <p><strong>Which types should be “covered”?</strong></p> <p>What was described above is a rather coarse grained way to determine coverage. One could imagine a criterion that flags expressions as uncovered if <em>any</em> part of their type includes <code>any</code>, for example <code>Array&lt;any&gt;</code>. While there is value in a metric like this, the “uncovered” part of the type will typically be uncovered through various operations on values of this type. For example, in the code</p> <pre data-language="javascript">declare var arr: Array&lt;any&gt;;
arr.forEach(x =&gt; {});
</pre> <p>the parameter <code>x</code> will be flagged as uncovered. Also, in practice, a strict criterion like this would be too noisy and rather expensive to compute on the fly.</p> <p><strong>Union types</strong></p> <p>An exception to this principle are union types: the type <code>number | any</code> is considered <em>uncovered</em>, even though technically <code>any</code> is not the top-level constructor. Unions merely encode an option among <em>a set of</em> other types. In that sense we are conservatively viewing an expression as uncovered, when at least one possible type of that expression causes limited checking. For example, in the code</p> <pre data-language="javascript">let x: number | any = 1;
x = "a";
</pre> <p>Flow will let you assign anything to <code>x</code>, which reduces confidence in the use of <code>x</code> as a number. Thus <code>x</code> is considered uncovered.</p> <p><strong>The empty type</strong></p> <p>An interesting type from a coverage perspective is the <code>empty</code> type. This type roughly corresponds to <em>dead code</em>. As such checking around expressions with type <code>empty</code> is more relaxed, but for a good reason: this code will not be executed at runtime. Since it is a common practice to clean up such code, Flow coverage will also report code whose type is inferred to be <code>empty</code>, but distinguishes it from the case of <code>any</code>.</p> <h2 id="toc-command-line-use">Command Line Use </h2> <p>To find out the coverage of a file foo.js with the following contents</p> <pre data-language="javascript">// @flow
function add(one: any, two: any): number {
  return one + two;
}

add(1, 2);
</pre> <p>you can issue the following command</p> <pre data-language="plaintext">$ flow coverage file.js
Covered: 50.00% (5 of 10 expressions)</pre> <p>This output means that 5 out of the 10 nodes of this program were inferred to have type <code>any</code>. To see exactly which parts are uncovered you can also pass one of the following flags:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>--color</code>: This will print foo.js on the terminal with the uncovered locations in red color.</li> <li>
<code>--json</code>: This will list out all location spans that are uncovered under the tag <code>"uncovered_locs"</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Finally, as an example of dead code, consider the code</p> <pre data-language="javascript">function untypedAdd(one, two) {
  return one + two;
}
</pre> <p>Note that function <code>untypedAdd</code> is never called, so <code>one</code> and <code>two</code> will be inferred to have type <code>empty</code>. In the colored version of this command these parts appear in blue color, and in the JSON version they are under the tag <code>"empty_locs"</code>.</p> <p><strong>Use on multiple files</strong></p> <p>If you want to check coverage of multiple files at once, Flow offers the <code>batch-coverage</code> command:</p> <pre data-language="plaintext">$ flow batch-coverage dir/</pre> <p>will report coverage statistics for each file under <code>dir/</code>, as well as aggregate results.</p> <p>Note that <code>batch-coverage</code> requires a non-lazy Flow server.</p><div class="_attribution">
