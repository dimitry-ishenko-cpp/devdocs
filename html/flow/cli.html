<h1>Flow CLI</h1> <p>The flow command line tool is made to be easy-to-use for simple cases.</p> <p>Using the command <code>flow</code> will type-check your current directory if the <code>.flowconfig</code> file is present. A flow server will automatically be started if needed.</p> <p>The CLI tool also provides several other options and commands that allow you to control the server and build tools that integrate with Flow. For example, this is how the <a href="https://nuclide.io/">Nuclide</a> editor integrates with Flow to provide autocompletion, type errors, etc. in its UI.</p> <p>To find out more about the CLI just type:</p> <pre data-language="sh">flow --help</pre> <p>This will give you information about everything that flow can do. Running this command should print something like this:</p> <pre data-language="plaintext">Usage: flow [COMMAND] [PROJECT_ROOT]
