<h1>Type Annotations</h1> <p>Adding type annotations is an important part of your interaction with Flow.</p> <p>Flow has a powerful ability to infer the types of your programs. The majority of your code can rely on it. Still, there are places where you’ll want to add types.</p> <p>Imagine the following <code>concat</code> function for concatenating two strings together.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">function concat(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
</pre> <p>When you use this function, Flow knows exactly what is going on.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">concat("A", "B"); // Works!
</pre> <p>However, you can use the <code>+</code> operator on strings or numbers, so this would also be valid.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">concat(1, 2); // Works!
</pre> <p>But suppose you only want to allow strings in your function. For that you can add types.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">function concat(a: string, b: string) {
  return a + b;
}
</pre> <p>Now you’ll get a warning from Flow if you try to use numbers.</p> <pre data-language="javascript">// @flow
function concat(a: string, b: string) {
  return a + b;
}

concat("A", "B"); // Works!
concat(1, 2); // Error!
</pre> <p>Setting up “boundaries” with your types means you can tell Flow your intent on top of the inference it already does.</p> <p>This guide will teach you the syntax and semantics of all the different types you can have in Flow.</p><div class="_attribution">
