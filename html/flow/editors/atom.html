<h1>Atom</h1> <p>If you’re using <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> you have a bunch of options to integrate Flow into your code base.</p> <h2 id="toc-ide-flowtype">Flow for Atom IDE </h2> <pre data-language="sh">apm install atom-ide-ui &amp;&amp; apm install ide-flowtype</pre> <p><a href="https://atom.io/packages/ide-flowtype">Flow for Atom IDE</a> is extracted from <a href="https://nuclide.io">Nuclide</a>, and works with the <a href="https://ide.atom.io/">Atom IDE</a> UI. It brings the core features you expect in a full-featured IDE into Atom, such as language-aware autocomplete, diagnostics, go-to-definition, type hints, and symbol outlines.</p> <h2 id="toc-flow-ide">Flow-IDE </h2> <pre data-language="sh">apm install flow-ide</pre> <p><a href="https://atom.io/packages/flow-ide">Flow-IDE</a> is a smaller package that only provides you with a linter and autocomplete functionality. It, too, currently lacks support for on-the-fly linting.</p> <h2 id="toc-linter-flow">Linter-Flow </h2> <pre data-language="sh">apm install linter-flow</pre> <p>In case you’re looking for something even more minimal, <a href="https://atom.io/packages/linter-flow">linter-flow</a> may be worth your attention. It only lints your code and provides no other features, but it does support on-the-fly linting.</p> <h2 id="toc-autocomplete-flow">Autocomplete-Flow </h2> <pre data-language="sh">apm install autocomplete-flow</pre> <p><a href="https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-flow">autocomplete-flow</a> is another purpose-built tool that only does one thing. This package, as the name suggests, will give your flow enabled code autocomplete suggestions and nothing else.</p><div class="_attribution">
