<h1>.flowconfig [include]</h1> <p>Flow needs to know which files to read and watch for changes. This set of files is determined by taking all included files and excluding all the ignored files.</p> <p>The <code>[include]</code> section in a <code>.flowconfig</code> file tells Flow to include the specified files or directories. Including a directory recursively includes all the files under that directory. Symlinks are followed as long as they lead to a file or directory that is also included. Each line in the include section is a path to include. These paths can be relative to the root directory or absolute, and support both single and double star wildcards.</p> <p>The project root directory (where your <code>.flowconfig</code> lives) is automatically included.</p> <p>For example, if <code>/path/to/root/.flowconfig</code> contains the following <code>[include]</code> section:</p> <pre data-language="plaintext">[include]
../externalFile.js
../externalDir/
../otherProject/*.js
../otherProject/**/coolStuff/</pre> <p>Then when Flow checks the project in <code>/path/to/root</code>, it will read and watch</p> <ol> <li>
<code>/path/to/root/</code> (automatically included)</li> <li><code>/path/to/externalFile.js</code></li> <li><code>/path/to/externalDir/</code></li> <li>Any file in <code>/path/to/otherProject/</code> that ends in <code>.js</code>
</li> <li>Any directory under <code>/path/to/otherProject</code> named <code>coolStuff/</code>
</li> </ol><div class="_attribution">
