<h1>.flowconfig [libs]</h1> <p>The <code>[libs]</code> section in a <code>.flowconfig</code> file tells Flow to include the specified <a href="https://flow.org/en/libdefs/">library definitions</a> when type checking your code. Multiple libraries can be specified. By default, the <code>flow-typed</code> folder in your project root directory is included as a library directory. This default allows you to use <a href="https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed"><code>flow-typed</code></a> to install library definitions without additional configuration.</p> <p>Each line in the <code>[libs]</code> section is a path to the library file or directory which you would like to include. These paths can be relative to the project root directory or absolute. Including a directory recursively includes all the files under that directory as library files.</p><div class="_attribution">
