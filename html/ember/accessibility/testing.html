It should be noted that these may change over time, so periodic review of this list is recommended. </p> <ul> <li>Firefox &amp; NVDA (Windows)</li> <li>IE &amp; JAWS (Windows)</li> <li>Edge &amp; Narrator (Windows)</li> <li>Safari &amp; VoiceOver (MacOS)</li> </ul> <p>The absolute best method for learning how a screen reader works is using one yourself! It might feel a little awkward at first, but understanding how to use a screen reader (and other assistive technology) will help you become a more skilled developer.</p> </section> </div> <div class="_attribution">
