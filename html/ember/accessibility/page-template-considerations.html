<h1> Page Template Considerations </h1>  <div id="ember349073" class="ember-view">
<p>When considering an application's page or view structure, there are a few primary concerns that should be planned for:</p> <ul> <li>page title</li> <li>skip navigation links</li> <li>focus management</li> </ul> <h2 id="toc_page-title">Page Title</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_page-title"> <p>Each page (what is rendered for a unique URL) should have a page title. This page title should be unique to that page, and should accurately reflect what that page does.</p> <p>Consider this format:</p> <p><code>Unique Page Title - Site Title</code></p> <p><img width="675px" title="Page Title Example" alt="A visual representation of page title in the browser's tab" src="https://guides.emberjs.com/v4.9.0/images/accessibility/page-template-considerations/page-title.png"></p> <p>Note that the unique page title is first. This is because it is the most important piece of information from a contextual perspective. Since a user with a screen reader can interrupt the screen reader as they wish, it introduces less fatigue when the unique page title is first, but provides the additional guidance if it is desired.</p> <p>A simple way to add page titles is to use the <code>page-title</code> helper which comes from the <a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-page-title">ember-page-title</a> addon that is installed by default in new apps. We can use this helper to set the page title at any point in any template.</p> <p>For example, if we have a “posts” route, we can set the page title for it like so:</p> <pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars" data-filename="app/routes/posts.hbs">{{page-title "Posts - Site Title"}}

{{outlet}}
</code></pre> <p>Extending the example, if we have a “post” route that lives within the “posts” route, we could set its page title like so:</p> <pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars" data-filename="app/routes/posts/post.hbs">{{page-title (concat @model.title " - Site Title")}}

&lt;h1&gt;{{@model.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre> <p>When your needs become more complex, the following addons facilitate page titles in a more dynamic and maintainable way.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/ronco/ember-cli-head">ember-cli-head</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/kimroen/ember-cli-document-title">ember-cli-document-title</a></li> </ul> <p>To evaluate more addons to add/manage content in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of a page, view this category on <a href="https://emberobserver.com/categories/header-content">Ember Observer</a>.</p> <p>You can test that page titles are generated correctly by asserting on the value of <code>document.title</code> in your tests:</p> <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-filename="tests/acceptance/posts-test.js">import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { visit, currentURL } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-qunit';

module('Acceptance | posts', function(hooks) {
  setupApplicationTest(hooks);

  test('visiting /posts', async function(assert) {
    await visit('/posts');
    assert.equal(document.title, 'Posts - Site Title');
  });
});
</code></pre> </section> <h2 id="toc_skip-navigation-links">Skip Navigation Links</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_skip-navigation-links"> <p>A skip navigation link, or skip link, is a useful feature for users who want to bypass content that is repeated on multiple pages (i.e., a site header). This can especially helpful to users with assistive technology, who have to browse website content in a more linear fashion, but it can also be useful for power users who prefer to navigate websites only using a keyboard.</p> <p><img width="675px" title="Skip Main Content Example" alt="A visual representation of how the skip link works in the browser" src="https://guides.emberjs.com/v4.9.0/images/accessibility/page-template-considerations/skip-main-content.png"></p> <p>To implement a skip link in an application, add an anchor element as close as possible after the opening <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, and have it link to the beginning of the page's main content area.</p> <p>To read more about skip links, visit the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#Skip_links">MDN docs</a>.</p> </section> <h2 id="toc_focus-management">Focus Management</h2> <section aria-labelledby="toc_focus-management"> <p>No single-page application framework provides the appropriate route-level focus for assistive technology in a default manner. This is primarily due to the way <code>pushState</code> works, and the lack of an event hook for JavaScript frameworks to tell assistive technology that the page content has changed. This <em>also</em> means that the focus is unchanged on route navigation, which in some cases means that it would be lost entirely (if the element that previously had focus is now gone).</p> <p>Most frameworks have some mechanism for adding the missing functionality to an application. In Ember, there is an attempt to address these two specific shortcomings with <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/433">RFC 433</a>; in the meantime there are a few addons that exist to help provide page or view-level focus for your application. All options should be evaluated to determine which is the appropriate use case for your application:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y">ember-a11y</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/linkedin/self-focused/tree/master/packages/ember-self-focused">ember-self-focused</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/MelSumner/ember-a11y-refocus">ember-a11y-refocus</a></li> </ul> </section> </div> <div class="_attribution">
