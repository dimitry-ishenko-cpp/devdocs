<h1> Introduction </h1>  <div id="ember361614" class="ember-view">
<p>Imagine we are writing a web app for managing a blog. At any given time, we should be able to answer questions like <em>What post are they looking at?</em> and <em>Are they editing it?</em> In Ember.js, the answer to these questions is determined by the URL.</p> <p>The URL can be set in a few ways:</p> <ul> <li>The user loads the app for the first time.</li> <li>The user changes the URL manually, such as by clicking the back button or by editing the address bar.</li> <li>The user clicks a link within the app.</li> <li>Some other event in the app causes the URL to change.</li> </ul> <p>Regardless of how the URL becomes set, the Ember router then maps the current URL to one or more route handlers. A route handler can do several things:</p> <ul> <li>It can render a template.</li> <li>It can load a model that is then available to the template.</li> <li>It can redirect to a new route, such as if the user isn't allowed to visit that part of the app.</li> <li>It can handle actions that involve changing a model or transitioning to a new route.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="_attribution">
