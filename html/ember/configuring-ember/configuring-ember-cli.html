<h1> Configuring Ember CLI </h1>  <div id="ember353118" class="ember-view">
<p>In addition to configuring your app itself, you can also configure Ember CLI. These configurations can be made by adding them to the <code>.ember-cli</code> file in your application's root. Many can also be made by passing them as arguments to the command line program.</p> <p>For example, a common desire is to change the port that Ember CLI serves the app from. It's possible to pass the port number from the command line with <code>ember server --port 8080</code>. To make this configuration permanent, edit your <code>.ember-cli</code> file like so:</p> <pre><code class="json language-json">{
  "port": 8080
}
</code></pre> <p>For a full list of command line options, run <code>ember help</code>.</p> <p>More information on configuring the Ember CLI can be found in the <a href="https://cli.emberjs.com/release/appendix/configuration/">CLI Guides</a>.</p> </div> <div class="_attribution">
