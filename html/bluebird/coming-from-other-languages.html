<h1 class="post-title">Coming from Other Languages</h1>   <p>This page describes parallels of using promises in other languages. Promises as a pattern are very common in other languages and knowing what they map to in other languages might help you with grasping them conceptually</p> <ul> <li><a href="#c" title="">C#</a></li> <li><a href="#scala" title="">Scala</a></li> <li><a href="#python" title="">Python</a></li> <li><a href="#c" title="">C++</a></li> <li><a href="#haskell" title="">Haskell</a></li> <li><a href="#java" title="">Java</a></li> <li><a href="#android-java" title="">Android Java</a></li> <li><a href="#objective-c" title="">Objective-C</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="c">  C# </h2> <p>A promise is similar to a C# <code>Task</code>. They both represent the result of an operation.</p> <p>A promise's <code>then</code> method is similar to a Task's <code>ContinueWith</code> method in that both allow attaching a continuation to the promise. Bluebird's <a href="api/promise.coroutine.html"><code>Promise.coroutine</code></a> is analogous to C#'s <code>async/await</code> syntax.</p> <p>A <code>TaskCompletionSource</code> is analogous to the promise constructor. Although usually promisification is preferred (see the API reference or working with callbacks section).</p> <p><code>Task.FromResult</code> is analogous to <a href="api/promise.resolve.html"><code>Promise.resolve</code></a>.</p> <p>The difference between a <code>Task</code> and a promise are that a task might not be started and might require a <code>.Start</code> call where a promise always represents an already started operation.</p> <p>In addition promises are always unwrapped. A promise implicitly has <code>Task.Unwrap</code> called on it - that is, promises perform recursive assimilation of promises within them.</p> <p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26136389/how-can-i-realize-pattern-promise-deffered" title="">this question on StackOverflow</a> for more differences.</p> <h2 id="scala">  Scala </h2> <p>A bluebird promise is similar to a Scala <code>Future</code>. A scala <code>Promise</code> is similar to how the promise constructor can be used (previously, to a bluebird Deferred).</p> <p>Just like a future, a promise represents a value over time. The value can resolve to either a fulfilled (ok completion) or rejected (error completion) state.</p> <p>Where blocking on a Future in scala is discouraged, in JavaScript it's downright impossible.</p> <p>In addition promises are always unwrapped. That is, promises perform recursive assimilation of promises within them. You can't have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> where a <code>Future[Future[T]]</code> is valid in Scala.</p> <p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22724883/js-deferred-promise-future-compared-to-functional-languages-like-scala" title="">this question on StackOverflow</a> for more differences.</p> <h2 id="python">  Python </h2> <p>A promise is similar to a Twisted Deferred object. In fact the first JavaScript implementations of promises were based on it. However, the APIs have diverged since. The mental model is still very similar.</p> <p>A promise is <em>not</em> similar to a Python <code>concurrent.Future</code> which does not chain actions.</p> <p>Asyncio coroutines are similar to bluebird coroutines in what they let you do, however bluebird coroutines also enable functional-style chaining.</p> <h2 id="c">  C++ </h2> <p>A bluebird promise is similar to a <code>std::future</code> and the promise constructor is similar to an <code>std::promise</code> although it should rarely be used in practice (see the promisification section).</p> <p>However, a bluebird promise is more powerful than the current implementation of <code>std::future</code> since while chaining has been discussed it is not yet implemented. Promises can be chained together.</p> <p>Boost futures expose a <code>.then</code> method similar to promises and allow this functionality.</p> <h2 id="haskell">  Haskell </h2> <p>A promise is a monadic construct with <code>.then</code> filling the role of <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> (bind). The major difference is that <code>.then</code> performs recursive assimilation which acts like a <code>flatMap</code> or a map. The type signature of <code>then</code> is quote complicated. If we omit the error argument and not throw - it's similar to:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">then::Promise a -&gt; (a -&gt; (Either (Promise b) b)) -&gt; Promise b
</pre> <p>That is, you can return either a promise <em>or a plain value</em> from a <code>then</code> without wrapping it.</p> <p>Promises perform a role similar to <code>IO</code> in that they allow for easy chaining of asynchronous non-blocking operations. <code>Promise.coroutine</code> can be seen as similar to <code>do</code> notation although in practice it's not an accurate comparison.</p> <h2 id="java">  Java </h2> <p>A promise is similar to a guava <code>Future</code> with <code>chain</code> being similar to <code>then</code>.</p> <p>If your'e familiar with Java 8 lambdas, you can think of a promise as a <code>Future</code> you can <code>map</code> to another future.</p> <h2 id="android-java">  Android Java </h2> <p>Several popular Android libraries use promises - for example the Parse Java API returns <code>Task</code>s which are similar to JavaScript promises.</p> <h2 id="objective-c">  Objective-C </h2> <p>If you're familiar with PromiseKit, it is based on a same specification bluebird is based on so the API should feel familiar right away.</p><div class="_attribution">
