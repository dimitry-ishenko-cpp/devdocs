<h1>log_server_status - Log periodic status summaries</h1>  <p>This perl script is designed to be run at a frequent interval by something like cron. It connects to the server and downloads the status information. It reformats the information to a single line and logs it to a file. Adjust the variables at the top of the script to specify the location of the resulting logfile. <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_status.html">mod_status</a></code> will need to be loaded and configured in order for this script to do its job.</p>    <h2 id="configure">Usage</h2> <p>The script contains the following section.</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">my $wherelog = "/usr/local/apache2/logs/";  # Logs will be like "/usr/local/apache2/logs/19960312"
my $server   = "localhost";        # Name of server, could be "www.foo.com"
my $port     = "80";               # Port on server
my $request = "/server-status/?auto";    # Request to send</pre> <p>You'll need to ensure that these variables have the correct values, and you'll need to have the <code>/server-status</code> handler configured at the location specified, and the specified log location needs to be writable by the user which will run the script.</p> <p>Run the script periodically via cron to produce a daily log file, which can then be used for statistical analysis.</p><div class="_attribution">
