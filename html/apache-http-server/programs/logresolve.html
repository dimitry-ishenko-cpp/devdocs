<h1>logresolve - Resolve IP-addresses to hostnames in Apache log files</h1>  <p><code>logresolve</code> is a post-processing program to resolve IP-addresses in Apache's access logfiles. To minimize impact on your nameserver, logresolve has its very own internal hash-table cache. This means that each IP number will only be looked up the first time it is found in the log file.</p> <p>Takes an Apache log file on standard input. The IP addresses must be the first thing on each line and must be separated from the remainder of the line by a space.</p>     <h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2> <pre>logresolve [ -s filename ] [ -c ] &lt; access_log &gt; access_log.new</pre>   <h2 id="options">Options</h2> <dl> <dt><code>-s filename</code></dt> <dd>Specifies a filename to record statistics.</dd> <dt><code>-c</code></dt> <dd>This causes <code>logresolve</code> to apply some DNS checks: after finding the hostname from the IP address, it looks up the IP addresses for the hostname and checks that one of these matches the original address.</dd> </dl><div class="_attribution">
