<h1>Redirecting and Remapping with mod_rewrite</h1>  <p>This document supplements the <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a></code> <a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">reference documentation</a>. It describes how you can use <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a></code> to redirect and remap request. This includes many examples of common uses of mod_rewrite, including detailed descriptions of how each works.</p> <div class="warning">Note that many of these examples won't work unchanged in your particular server configuration, so it's important that you understand them, rather than merely cutting and pasting the examples into your configuration.</div>     <h2 id="old-to-new">From Old to New (internal)</h2> <dl> <dt>Description:</dt> <dd> <p>Assume we have recently renamed the page <code>foo.html</code> to <code>bar.html</code> and now want to provide the old URL for backward compatibility. However, we want that users of the old URL even not recognize that the pages was renamed - that is, we don't want the address to change in their browser.</p> </dd> <dt>Solution:</dt> <dd> <p>We rewrite the old URL to the new one internally via the following rule:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">RewriteEngine  on

But this time we want that the users of the old URL get hinted to the new one, i.e. their browsers Location field should change, too.</p> </dd> <dt>Solution:</dt> <dd> <p>We force a HTTP redirect to the new URL which leads to a change of the browsers and thus the users view:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">RewriteEngine  on
RewriteRule    "^<strong>/foo</strong>\.html$"  "<strong>bar</strong>.html"  [<strong>R</strong>]</pre> </dd> <dt>Discussion</dt> <dd> <p>In this example, as contrasted to the <a href="#old-to-new-intern">internal</a> example above, we can simply use the Redirect directive. mod_rewrite was used in that earlier example in order to hide the redirect from the client:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">Redirect "/foo.html" "/bar.html"</pre> </dd> </dl>   <h2 id="movehomedirs">Resource Moved to Another Server</h2> <dl> <dt>Description:</dt> <dd> <p>If a resource has moved to another server, you may wish to have URLs continue to work for a time on the old server while people update their bookmarks.</p> </dd> <dt>Solution:</dt> <dd> <p>You can use <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a></code> to redirect these URLs to the new server, but you might also consider using the Redirect or RedirectMatch directive.</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">#With mod_rewrite

    RewriteRule "^(.*).html$" "$1.php"
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre> </dd> <dt>Discussion</dt> <dd> <p>This example uses an often-overlooked feature of mod_rewrite, by taking advantage of the order of execution of the ruleset. In particular, mod_rewrite evaluates the left-hand-side of the RewriteRule before it evaluates the RewriteCond directives. Consequently, $1 is already defined by the time the RewriteCond directives are evaluated. This allows us to test for the existence of the original (<code>document.html</code>) and target (<code>document.php</code>) files using the same base filename.</p> <p>This ruleset is designed to use in a per-directory context (In a &lt;Directory&gt; block or in a .htaccess file), so that the <code>-f</code> checks are looking at the correct directory path. You may need to set a <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritebase">RewriteBase</a></code> directive to specify the directory base that you're working in.</p> </dd> </dl>   <h2 id="canonicalhost">Canonical Hostnames</h2> <dl> <dt>Description:</dt> <dd>The goal of this rule is to force the use of a particular hostname, in preference to other hostnames which may be used to reach the same site. For example, if you wish to force the use of <strong>www.example.com</strong> instead of <strong>example.com</strong>, you might use a variant of the following recipe.</dd> <dt>Solution:</dt> <dd> <p>The very best way to solve this doesn't involve mod_rewrite at all, but rather uses the <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_alias.html#redirect">Redirect</a></code> directive placed in a virtual host for the non-canonical hostname(s).</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  ServerName undesired.example.com
  ServerAlias example.com notthis.example.com

  Redirect "/" "http://www.example.com/"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  ServerName www.example.com
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre> <p>You can alternatively accomplish this using the <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/core.html#if">&lt;If&gt;</a></code> directive:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">&lt;If "%{HTTP_HOST} != 'www.example.com'"&gt;
    Redirect "/" "http://www.example.com/"
&lt;/If&gt;</pre> <p>Or, for example, to redirect a portion of your site to HTTPS, you might do the following:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">&lt;If "%{SERVER_PROTOCOL} != 'HTTPS'"&gt;
    Redirect "/admin/" "https://www.example.com/admin/"
&lt;/If&gt;</pre> <p>If, for whatever reason, you still want to use <code>mod_rewrite</code> - if, for example, you need this to work with a larger set of RewriteRules - you might use one of the recipes below.</p> <p>For sites running on a port other than 80:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">RewriteCond "%{HTTP_HOST}"   "!^www\.example\.com" [NC]
RewriteCond "%{HTTP_HOST}"   "!^$"
RewriteCond "%{SERVER_PORT}" "!^80$"
RewriteRule "^/?(.*)"        "http://www.example.com:%{SERVER_PORT}/$1" [L,R,NE]</pre> <p>And for a site running on port 80</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">RewriteCond "%{HTTP_HOST}"   "!^www\.example\.com" [NC]
RewriteCond "%{HTTP_HOST}"   "!^$"
RewriteRule "^/?(.*)"        "http://www.example.com/$1" [L,R,NE]</pre> <p> If you wanted to do this generically for all domain names - that is, if you want to redirect <strong>example.com</strong> to <strong>www.example.com</strong> for all possible values of <strong>example.com</strong>, you could use the following recipe:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">RewriteCond "%{HTTP_HOST}" "!^www\." [NC]
RewriteCond "%{HTTP_HOST}" "!^$"
RewriteRule "^/?(.*)"      "http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1" [L,R,NE]</pre> <p>These rulesets will work either in your main server configuration file, or in a <code>.htaccess</code> file placed in the <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/core.html#documentroot">DocumentRoot</a></code> of the server.</p> </dd> </dl>   <h2 id="multipledirs">Search for pages in more than one directory</h2> <dl> <dt>Description:</dt> <dd> <p>A particular resource might exist in one of several places, and we want to look in those places for the resource when it is requested.

The following config does the following: If the HTTP header "User-Agent" contains "Mozilla/3", the page <code>foo.html</code> is rewritten to <code>foo.NS.html</code> and the rewriting stops. If the browser is "Lynx" or "Mozilla" of version 1 or 2, the URL becomes <code>foo.20.html</code>. All other browsers receive page <code>foo.32.html</code>.

</h2> <dl> <dt>Description:</dt> <dd> <p>Usually the <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/core.html#documentroot">DocumentRoot</a></code> of the webserver directly relates to the URL "<code>/</code>". But often this data is not really of top-level priority. For example, you may wish for visitors, on first entering a site, to go to a particular subdirectory <code>/about/</code>. This may be accomplished using the following ruleset:</p> </dd> <dt>Solution:</dt> <dd> <p>We redirect the URL <code>/</code> to <code>/about/</code>: </p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule   "^/$"  "/about/"  [<strong>R</strong>]</pre> <p>Note that this can also be handled using the <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_alias.html#redirectmatch">RedirectMatch</a></code> directive:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">RedirectMatch "^/$" "http://example.com/about/"</pre> <p>Note also that the example rewrites only the root URL. That is, it rewrites a request for <code>http://example.com/</code>, but not a request for <code>http://example.com/page.html</code>. If you have in fact changed your document root - that is, if <strong>all</strong> of your content is in fact in that subdirectory, it is greatly preferable to simply change your <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/core.html#documentroot">DocumentRoot</a></code> directive, or move all of the content up one directory, rather than rewriting URLs.</p> </dd> </dl>   <h2 id="fallback-resource">Fallback Resource</h2> <dl> <dt>Description:</dt> <dd>You want a single resource (say, a certain file, like index.php) to handle all requests that come to a particular directory, except those that should go to an existing resource such as an image, or a css file.</dd> <dt>Solution:</dt> <dd> <p>As of version 2.2.16, you should use the <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_dir.html#fallbackresource">FallbackResource</a></code> directive for this:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">&lt;Directory "/var/www/my_blog"&gt;
  FallbackResource "index.php"
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre> <p>However, in earlier versions of Apache, or if your needs are more complicated than this, you can use a variation of the following rewrite set to accomplish the same thing:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">&lt;Directory "/var/www/my_blog"&gt;
  RewriteBase "/my_blog"

  RewriteCond "/var/www/my_blog/%{REQUEST_FILENAME}" !-f
  RewriteCond "/var/www/my_blog/%{REQUEST_FILENAME}" !-d
  RewriteRule "^" "index.php" [PT]
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre> <p>If, on the other hand, you wish to pass the requested URI as a query string argument to index.php, you can replace that RewriteRule with:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">RewriteRule "(.*)" "index.php?$1" [PT,QSA]</pre> <p>Note that these rulesets can be used in a <code>.htaccess</code> file, as well as in a &lt;Directory&gt; block.</p> </dd> </dl>   <h2 id="rewrite-query">Rewrite query string</h2> <dl> <dt>Description:</dt> <dd>You want to capture a particular value from a query string and either replace it or incorporate it into another component of the URL.</dd> <dt>Solutions:</dt> <dd> <p> Many of the solutions in this section will all use the same condition, which leaves the matched value in the %2 backreference. %1 is the beginining of the query string (up to the key of intererest), and %3 is the remainder.

RewriteCond "%2" !=not-so-secret-value
