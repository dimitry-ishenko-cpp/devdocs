<h1>Apache mod_rewrite</h1>  <p><code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a></code> provides a way to modify incoming URL requests, dynamically, based on <a href="intro.html#regex">regular expression</a> rules. This allows you to map arbitrary URLs onto your internal URL structure in any way you like.</p> <p>It supports an unlimited number of rules and an unlimited number of attached rule conditions for each rule to provide a really flexible and powerful URL manipulation mechanism. The URL manipulations can depend on various tests: server variables, environment variables, HTTP headers, time stamps, external database lookups, and various other external programs or handlers, can be used to achieve granular URL matching.</p> <p>Rewrite rules can operate on the full URLs, including the path-info and query string portions, and may be used in per-server context (<code>httpd.conf</code>), per-virtualhost context (<code class="directive"><a href="../mod/core.html#virtualhost">&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</a></code> blocks), or per-directory context (<code>.htaccess</code> files and <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/core.html#directory">&lt;Directory&gt;</a></code> blocks). The rewritten result can lead to further rules, internal sub-processing, external request redirection, or proxy passthrough, depending on what <a href="flags.html">flags</a> you attach to the rules.</p> <p>Since mod_rewrite is so powerful, it can indeed be rather complex. This document supplements the <a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">reference documentation</a>, and attempts to allay some of that complexity, and provide highly annotated examples of common scenarios that you may handle with mod_rewrite. But we also attempt to show you when you should not use mod_rewrite, and use other standard Apache features instead, thus avoiding this unnecessary complexity.</p> <ul> <li><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite reference documentation</a></li> <li><a href="intro.html">Introduction to regular expressions and mod_rewrite</a></li> <li><a href="remapping.html">Using mod_rewrite for redirection and remapping of URLs</a></li> <li><a href="access.html">Using mod_rewrite to control access</a></li> <li><a href="vhosts.html">Dynamic virtual hosts with mod_rewrite</a></li> <li><a href="proxy.html">Dynamic proxying with mod_rewrite</a></li> <li><a href="rewritemap.html">Using RewriteMap</a></li> <li><a href="advanced.html">Advanced techniques</a></li> <li><a href="avoid.html">When <strong>NOT</strong> to use mod_rewrite</a></li> <li><a href="flags.html">RewriteRule Flags</a></li> <li><a href="tech.html">Technical details</a></li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
