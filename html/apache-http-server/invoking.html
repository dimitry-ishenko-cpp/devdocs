<h1>Starting Apache</h1>  <p>On Windows, Apache is normally run as a service. For details, see <a href="platform/windows.html#winsvc">Running Apache as a Service</a>. </p> <p>On Unix, the <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code> program is run as a daemon that executes continuously in the background to handle requests. This document describes how to invoke <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code>.</p>     <h2 id="startup">How Apache Starts</h2> <p>If the <code class="directive"><a href="mod/mpm_common.html#listen">Listen</a></code> specified in the configuration file is default of 80 (or any other port below 1024), then it is necessary to have root privileges in order to start apache, so that it can bind to this privileged port. Once the server has started and performed a few preliminary activities such as opening its log files, it will launch several <em>child</em> processes which do the work of listening for and answering requests from clients. The main <code>httpd</code> process continues to run as the root user, but the child processes run as a less privileged user. This is controlled by the selected <a href="mpm.html">Multi-Processing Module</a>.</p> <p>The recommended method of invoking the <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code> executable is to use the <code class="program"><a href="programs/apachectl.html">apachectl</a></code> control script. This script sets certain environment variables that are necessary for <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code> to function correctly under some operating systems, and then invokes the <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code> binary. <code class="program"><a href="programs/apachectl.html">apachectl</a></code> will pass through any command line arguments, so any <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code> options may also be used with <code class="program"><a href="programs/apachectl.html">apachectl</a></code>. You may also directly edit the <code class="program"><a href="programs/apachectl.html">apachectl</a></code> script by changing the <code>HTTPD</code> variable near the top to specify the correct location of the <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code> binary and any command-line arguments that you wish to be <em>always</em> present.</p> <p>The first thing that <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code> does when it is invoked is to locate and read the <a href="configuring.html">configuration file</a> <code>httpd.conf</code>. The location of this file is set at compile-time, but it is possible to specify its location at run time using the <code>-f</code> command-line option as in</p> <div class="example"><pre>/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl -f /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf</pre></div> <p>If all goes well during startup, the server will detach from the terminal and the command prompt will return almost immediately. This indicates that the server is up and running. You can then use your browser to connect to the server and view the test page in the <code class="directive"><a href="mod/core.html#documentroot">DocumentRoot</a></code> directory.</p>   <h2 id="errors">Errors During Start-up</h2> <p>If Apache suffers a fatal problem during startup, it will write a message describing the problem either to the console or to the <code class="directive"><a href="mod/core.html#errorlog">ErrorLog</a></code> before exiting. One of the most common error messages is "<code>Unable to bind to Port ...</code>". This message is usually caused by either:</p> <ul> <li>Trying to start the server on a privileged port when not logged in as the root user; or</li> <li>Trying to start the server when there is another instance of Apache or some other web server already bound to the same Port.</li> </ul> <p>For further trouble-shooting instructions, consult the Apache <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/FAQ">FAQ</a>.</p>   <h2 id="boot">Starting at Boot-Time</h2> <p>If you want your server to continue running after a system reboot, you should add a call to <code class="program"><a href="programs/apachectl.html">apachectl</a></code> to your system startup files (typically <code>rc.local</code> or a file in an <code>rc.N</code> directory). This will start Apache as root. Before doing this ensure that your server is properly configured for security and access restrictions.</p> <p>The <code class="program"><a href="programs/apachectl.html">apachectl</a></code> script is designed to act like a standard SysV init script; it can take the arguments <code>start</code>, <code>restart</code>, and <code>stop</code> and translate them into the appropriate signals to <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code>. So you can often simply link <code class="program"><a href="programs/apachectl.html">apachectl</a></code> into the appropriate init directory. But be sure to check the exact requirements of your system.</p>   <h2 id="info">Additional Information</h2> <p>Additional information about the command-line options of <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code> and <code class="program"><a href="programs/apachectl.html">apachectl</a></code> as well as other support programs included with the server is available on the <a href="programs/index.html">Server and Supporting Programs</a> page. There is also documentation on all the <a href="mod/index.html">modules</a> included with the Apache distribution and the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/directives.html">directives</a> that they provide.</p><div class="_attribution">
