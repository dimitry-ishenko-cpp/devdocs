</table> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>The Server consists of a main, parent process and a small, static number of child processes.</p> <p>The parent process's job is to manage the child processes. This involves spawning children as required to ensure there are always <code class="directive"><a href="mpm_common.html#startservers">StartServers</a></code> processes accepting connections.</p> <p>Each child process consists of a pool of worker threads and a main thread that accepts connections and passes them to the workers via a work queue. The worker thread pool is dynamic, managed by a maintenance thread so that the number of idle threads is kept between <code class="directive"><a href="mpm_common.html#minsparethreads">MinSpareThreads</a></code> and <code class="directive"><a href="mpm_common.html#maxsparethreads">MaxSpareThreads</a></code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
