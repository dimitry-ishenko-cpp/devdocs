</table> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>This module enables different Virtual Hosts to run with different Unix <var>User</var> and <var>Group</var> IDs, and with different <a href="http://sosc-dr.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/least_privilege.jsp">Solaris Privileges</a>. In particular, it offers a solution to the problem of privilege separation between different Virtual Hosts, first promised by the abandoned perchild MPM. It also offers other security enhancements.</p> <p>Unlike perchild, <code class="module"><a href="mod_privileges.html">mod_privileges</a></code> is not itself an MPM. It works <em>within</em> a processing model to set privileges and User/Group <em>per request</em> in a running process. It is therefore not compatible with a threaded MPM, and will refuse to run under one.</p> <p><code class="module"><a href="mod_privileges.html">mod_privileges</a></code> raises security issues similar to those of <a href="../suexec.html">suexec</a>. But unlike suexec, it applies not only to CGI programs but to the entire request processing cycle, including in-process applications and subprocesses. It is ideally suited to running PHP applications under <strong>mod_php</strong>, which is also incompatible with threaded MPMs. It is also well-suited to other in-process scripting applications such as <strong>mod_perl</strong>, <strong>mod_python</strong>, and <strong>mod_ruby</strong>, and to applications implemented in C as apache modules where privilege separation is an issue.</p>     <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2> <p><code class="module"><a href="mod_privileges.html">mod_privileges</a></code> introduces new security concerns in situations where <strong>untrusted code</strong> may be run <strong>within the webserver process</strong>. This applies to untrusted modules, and scripts running under modules such as mod_php or mod_perl. Scripts running externally (e.g. as CGI or in an appserver behind mod_proxy or mod_jk) are NOT affected.</p> <p>The basic security concerns with mod_privileges are:</p> <ul>
<li>Running as a system user introduces the same security issues as mod_suexec, and near-equivalents such as cgiwrap and suphp.</li> <li>A privileges-aware malicious user extension (module or script) could escalate its privileges to anything available to the httpd process in any virtual host. This introduces new risks if (and only if) mod_privileges is compiled with the <var>BIG_SECURITY_HOLE</var> option.</li> <li>A privileges-aware malicious user extension (module or script) could escalate privileges to set its user ID to another system user (and/or group).</li> </ul> <p>The <code class="directive">PrivilegesMode</code> directive allows you to select either <var>FAST</var> or <var>SECURE</var> mode. You can mix modes, using <var>FAST</var> mode for trusted users and fully-audited code paths, while imposing SECURE mode where an untrusted user has scope to introduce code.</p> <p>Before describing the modes, we should also introduce the target use cases: Benign vs Hostile. In a benign situation, you want to separate users for their convenience, and protect them and the server against the risks posed by honest mistakes, but you trust your users are not deliberately subverting system security. In a hostile situation - e.g. commercial hosting - you may have users deliberately attacking the system or each other.</p> <dl> <dt>FAST mode</dt> <dd>In <var>FAST</var> mode, requests are run in-process with the selected uid/gid and privileges, so the overhead is negligible. This is suitable for benign situations, but is not secure against an attacker escalating privileges with an in-process module or script.</dd> <dt>SECURE mode</dt> <dd>A request in <var>SECURE</var> mode forks a subprocess, which then drops privileges. This is a very similar case to running CGI with suexec, but for the entire request cycle, and with the benefit of fine-grained control of privileges.</dd> </dl> <p>You can select different <code class="directive">PrivilegesMode</code>s for each virtual host, and even in a directory context within a virtual host. <var>FAST</var> mode is appropriate where the user(s) are trusted and/or have no privilege to load in-process code. <var>SECURE</var> mode is appropriate to cases where untrusted code might be run in-process. However, even in <var>SECURE</var> mode, there is no protection against a malicious user who is able to introduce privileges-aware code running <em>before the start of the request-processing cycle.</em></p>   <div class="directive-section">

<p>This directive trades off performance vs security against malicious, privileges-aware code. In <var>SECURE</var> mode, each request runs in a secure subprocess, incurring a substantial performance penalty. In <var>FAST</var> mode, the server is not protected against escalation of privileges as discussed above.</p> <p>This directive differs slightly between a <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> context (including equivalents such as Location/Files/If) and a top-level or <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code>.</p> <p>At top-level, it sets a default that will be inherited by virtualhosts. In a virtual host, FAST or SECURE mode acts on the entire HTTP request, and any settings in a <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> context will be <strong>ignored</strong>. A third pseudo-mode SELECTIVE defers the choice of FAST vs SECURE to directives in a <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> context.</p> <p>In a <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> context, it is applicable only where SELECTIVE mode was set for the VirtualHost. Only FAST or SECURE can be set in this context (SELECTIVE would be meaningless).</p> <div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong></p> Where SELECTIVE mode is selected for a virtual host, the activation of privileges must be deferred until <em>after</em> the mapping phase of request processing has determined what <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> context applies to the request. This might give an attacker opportunities to introduce code through a <code class="directive"><a href="mod_rewrite.html#rewritemap">RewriteMap</a></code> running at top-level or <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> context <em>before</em> privileges have been dropped and userid/gid set. </div> </div>  <div class="directive-section">
