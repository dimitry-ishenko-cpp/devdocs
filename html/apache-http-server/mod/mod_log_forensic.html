</table> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>This module provides for forensic logging of client requests. Logging is done before and after processing a request, so the forensic log contains two log lines for each request. The forensic logger is very strict, which means:</p> <ul> <li>The format is fixed. You cannot modify the logging format at runtime.</li> <li>If it cannot write its data, the child process exits immediately and may dump core (depending on your <code class="directive"><a href="mpm_common.html#coredumpdirectory">CoreDumpDirectory</a></code> configuration).</li> </ul> <p>The <code>check_forensic</code> script, which can be found in the distribution's support directory, may be helpful in evaluating the forensic log output.</p>     <h2 id="formats">Forensic Log Format</h2> <p>Each request is logged two times. The first time is <em>before</em> it's processed further (that is, after receiving the headers). The second log entry is written <em>after</em> the request processing at the same time where normal logging occurs.</p> <p>In order to identify each request, a unique request ID is assigned. This forensic ID can be cross logged in the normal transfer log using the <code>%{forensic-id}n</code> format string. If you're using <code class="module"><a href="mod_unique_id.html">mod_unique_id</a></code>, its generated ID will be used.</p> <p>The first line logs the forensic ID, the request line and all received headers, separated by pipe characters (<code>|</code>). A sample line looks like the following (all on one line):</p> <div class="example"><pre>+yQtJf8CoAB4AAFNXBIEAAAAA|GET /manual/de/images/down.gif HTTP/1.1|Host:localhost%3a8080|User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv%3a1.6) Gecko/20040216 Firefox/0.8|Accept:image/png, etc...</pre></div> <p>The plus character at the beginning indicates that this is the first log line of this request. The second line just contains a minus character and the ID again:</p> <div class="example"><code>-yQtJf8CoAB4AAFNXBIEAAAAA</code></div> <p>The <code>check_forensic</code> script takes as its argument the name of the logfile. It looks for those <code>+</code>/<code>-</code> ID pairs and complains if a request was not completed.</p>   <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2> <p>See the <a href="../misc/security_tips.html#serverroot">security tips</a> document for details on why your security could be compromised if the directory where logfiles are stored is writable by anyone other than the user that starts the server.</p> <p>The log files may contain sensitive data such as the contents of <code>Authorization:</code> headers (which can contain passwords), so they should not be readable by anyone except the user that starts the server.</p>   <div class="directive-section">

Each log entry is assigned a unique ID which can be associated with the request using the normal <code class="directive"><a href="mod_log_config.html#customlog">CustomLog</a></code> directive. <code class="module"><a href="mod_log_forensic.html">mod_log_forensic</a></code> creates a token called <code>forensic-id</code>, which can be added to the transfer log using the <code>%{forensic-id}n</code> format string.</p> <p>The argument, which specifies the location to which the logs will be written, can take one of the following two types of values:</p> <dl> <dt><var>filename</var></dt> <dd>A filename, relative to the <code class="directive"><a href="core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</a></code>.</dd> <dt><var>pipe</var></dt> <dd>The pipe character "<code>|</code>", followed by the path to a program to receive the log information on its standard input. The program name can be specified relative to the <code class="directive"><a href="core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</a></code> directive. <div class="warning">
<p><strong>Security:</strong></p> <p>If a program is used, then it will be run as the user who started <code class="program"><a href="../programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code>. This will be root if the server was started by root; be sure that the program is secure or switches to a less privileged user.</p> </div> <div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong></p> <p>When entering a file path on non-Unix platforms, care should be taken to make sure that only forward slashes are used even though the platform may allow the use of back slashes. In general it is a good idea to always use forward slashes throughout the configuration files.</p> </div>
