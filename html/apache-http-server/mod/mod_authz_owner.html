</table> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>This module authorizes access to files by comparing the userid used for HTTP authentication (the web userid) with the file-system owner or group of the requested file. The supplied username and password must be already properly verified by an authentication module, such as <code class="module"><a href="mod_auth_basic.html">mod_auth_basic</a></code> or <code class="module"><a href="mod_auth_digest.html">mod_auth_digest</a></code>. <code class="module"><a href="mod_authz_owner.html">mod_authz_owner</a></code> recognizes two arguments for the <code class="directive"><a href="mod_authz_core.html#require">Require</a></code> directive, <code>file-owner</code> and <code>file-group</code>, as follows:</p> <dl> <dt><code>file-owner</code></dt> <dd>The supplied web-username must match the system's name for the owner of the file being requested. That is, if the operating system says the requested file is owned by <code>jones</code>, then the username used to access it through the web must be <code>jones</code> as well.</dd> <dt><code>file-group</code></dt> <dd>The name of the system group that owns the file must be present in a group database, which is provided, for example, by <code class="module"><a href="mod_authz_groupfile.html">mod_authz_groupfile</a></code> or <code class="module"><a href="mod_authz_dbm.html">mod_authz_dbm</a></code>, and the web-username must be a member of that group. For example, if the operating system says the requested file is owned by (system) group <code>accounts</code>, the group <code>accounts</code> must appear in the group database and the web-username used in the request must be a member of that group.</dd> </dl> <div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong></p> <p>If <code class="module"><a href="mod_authz_owner.html">mod_authz_owner</a></code> is used in order to authorize a resource that is not actually present in the filesystem (<em>i.e.</em> a virtual resource), it will deny the access.</p> <p>Particularly it will never authorize <a href="../content-negotiation.html#multiviews">content negotiated "MultiViews"</a> resources.</p> </div>     <h2 id="examples">Configuration Examples</h2> <h3><a name="examples.file-owner" id="examples.file-owner">Require file-owner</a></h3> <p>Consider a multi-user system running the Apache Web server, with each user having his or her own files in <code>~/public_html/private</code>. Assuming that there is a single <code class="directive"><a href="mod_authn_dbm.html#authdbmuserfile">AuthDBMUserFile</a></code> database that lists all of their web-usernames, and that these usernames match the system's usernames that actually own the files on the server, then the following stanza would allow only the user himself access to his own files. User <code>jones</code> would not be allowed to access files in <code>/home/smith/public_html/private</code> unless they were owned by <code>jones</code> instead of <code>smith</code>.</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">&lt;Directory "/home/*/public_html/private"&gt;
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName MyPrivateFiles
    AuthBasicProvider dbm
    AuthDBMUserFile "/usr/local/apache2/etc/.htdbm-all"
    Require file-owner
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre> <h3><a name="examples.file-group" id="examples.file-group">Require file-group</a></h3> <p>Consider a system similar to the one described above, but with some users that share their project files in <code>~/public_html/project-foo</code>. The files are owned by the system group <code>foo</code> and there is a single <code class="directive"><a href="mod_authz_dbm.html#authdbmgroupfile">AuthDBMGroupFile</a></code> database that contains all of the web-usernames and their group membership, <em>i.e.</em> they must be at least member of a group named <code>foo</code>. So if <code>jones</code> and <code>smith</code> are both member of the group <code>foo</code>, then both will be authorized to access the <code>project-foo</code> directories of each other.</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">&lt;Directory "/home/*/public_html/project-foo"&gt;
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Project Foo Files"
    AuthBasicProvider dbm
    
    # combined user/group database
    AuthDBMUserFile  "/usr/local/apache2/etc/.htdbm-all"
    AuthDBMGroupFile "/usr/local/apache2/etc/.htdbm-all"
    
    Satisfy All
    Require file-group
