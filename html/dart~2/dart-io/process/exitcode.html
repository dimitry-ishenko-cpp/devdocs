If the process was terminated due to a signal the exit code will be a negative value in the range <code>[-255..-1]</code>, where the absolute value of the exit code is the signal number. For example, if a process crashes due to a segmentation violation the exit code will be -11, as the signal SIGSEGV has the number 11.</p> <p>On Windows a process can report any 32-bit value as an exit code. When returning the exit code this exit code is turned into a signed value. Some special values are used to report termination due to some system event. E.g. if a process crashes due to an access violation the 32-bit exit code is <code>0xc0000005</code>, which will be returned as the negative number <code>-1073741819</code>. To get the original 32-bit value use <code>(0x100000000 + exitCode) &amp; 0xffffffff</code>.</p> <p>There is no guarantee that <a href="stdout.html">stdout</a> and <a href="stderr.html">stderr</a> have finished reporting the buffered output of the process when the returned future completes. To be sure that all output is captured, wait for the done event on the streams.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">Future&lt;int&gt; get exitCode;</pre><div class="_attribution">
