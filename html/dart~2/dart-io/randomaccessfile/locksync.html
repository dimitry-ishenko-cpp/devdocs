If no arguments are specified, the full file is locked, If only <code>start</code> is specified the file is locked from byte position <code>start</code> to the end of the file, no matter how large it grows. It is possible to specify an explicit value of <code>end</code> which is past the current length of the file.</p> <p>To obtain an exclusive lock on a file it must be opened for writing.</p> <p>If <code>mode</code> is <a href="../filelock/exclusive-constant.html">FileLock.exclusive</a> or <a href="../filelock/shared-constant.html">FileLock.shared</a>, an exception is thrown if the lock cannot be obtained. If <code>mode</code> is <a href="../filelock/blockingexclusive-constant.html">FileLock.blockingExclusive</a> or <a href="../filelock/blockingshared-constant.html">FileLock.blockingShared</a>, the call returns only after the lock has been obtained.</p> <p><em>NOTE</em> file locking does have slight differences in behavior across platforms:</p> <p>On Linux and OS X this uses advisory locks, which have the surprising semantics that all locks associated with a given file are removed when <em>any</em> file descriptor for that file is closed by the process. Note that this does not actually lock the file for access. Also note that advisory locks are on a process level. This means that several isolates in the same process can obtain an exclusive lock on the same file.</p> <p>On Windows the regions used for lock and unlock needs to match. If that is not the case unlocking will result in the OS error "The segment is already unlocked".</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">void lockSync(
