Renegotiation is only supported as a client and the HelloRequest must be received at a quiet point in the application protocol. This is sufficient to support the legacy use case of requesting a new client certificate between an HTTP request and response in (unpipelined) HTTP/1.1. NOTE: Renegotiation is an extremely problematic protocol feature and should only be used to communicate with legacy servers in environments where it is known to be safe.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">abstract bool allowLegacyUnsafeRenegotiation;</pre><div class="_attribution">
