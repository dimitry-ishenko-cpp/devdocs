<a href="../dart-core/int-class.html">int</a> code</li> </ol>) </wbr></section>  <p>Exit the Dart VM process immediately with the given exit code.</p> <p>This does not wait for any asynchronous operations to terminate nor execute <code>finally</code> blocks. Using <a href="exit.html">exit</a> is therefore very likely to lose data.</p> <p>While debugging, the VM will not respect the <code>--pause-isolates-on-exit</code> flag if <a href="exit.html">exit</a> is called as invoking this method causes the Dart VM process to shutdown immediately. To properly break on exit, consider calling <a href="../dart-developer/debugger.html">debugger</a> from <code>dart:developer</code> or <a href="../dart-isolate/isolate/pause.html">Isolate.pause</a> from <code>dart:isolate</code> on <a href="../dart-isolate/isolate/current.html">Isolate.current</a> to pause the isolate before invoking <a href="exit.html">exit</a>.</p> <p>The handling of exit codes is platform specific.</p> <p>On Linux and OS X an exit code for normal termination will always be in the range <code>[0..255]</code>. If an exit code outside this range is set the actual exit code will be the lower 8 bits masked off and treated as an unsigned value. E.g. using an exit code of -1 will result in an actual exit code of 255 being reported.</p> <p>On Windows the exit code can be set to any 32-bit value. However some of these values are reserved for reporting system errors like crashes.</p> <p>Besides this the Dart executable itself uses an exit code of <code>254</code> for reporting compile time errors and an exit code of <code>255</code> for reporting runtime error (unhandled exception).</p> <p>Due to these facts it is recommended to only use exit codes in the range [0..127] for communicating the result of running a Dart program to the surrounding environment. This will avoid any cross-platform issues.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">Never exit(int code) {
