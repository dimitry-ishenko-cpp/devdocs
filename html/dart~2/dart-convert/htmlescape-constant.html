Characters that are meaningful in HTML are converted to HTML entities (like <code>&amp;amp;</code> for <code>&amp;</code>).</p> <p>The general converter escapes all characters that are meaningful in HTML attributes or normal element context. Elements with special content types (like CSS or JavaScript) may need a more specialized escaping that understands that content type.</p> <p>If the context where the text will be inserted is known in more detail, it's possible to omit escaping some characters (like quotes when not inside an attribute value).</p> <p>The escaped text should only be used inside quoted HTML attributes values or as text content of a normal element. Using the escaped text inside a tag, but not inside a quoted attribute value, is still dangerous.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">const HtmlEscape htmlEscape = HtmlEscape();</pre><div class="_attribution">
