This means that equality of double values is not a proper equality relation, as is otherwise required of <code>operator==</code>. Using NaN in, e.g., a <a href="../../dart-collection/hashset-class.html">HashSet</a> will fail to work. The behavior is the standard IEEE-754 equality of doubles.</p> <p>If you can avoid NaN values, the remaining doubles do have a proper equality relation, and can be used safely.</p> <p>Use <a href="compareto.html">compareTo</a> for a comparison that distinguishes zero and minus zero, and that considers NaN values as equal.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">bool operator ==(Object other);</pre><div class="_attribution">
