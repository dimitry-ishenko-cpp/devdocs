Static and top-level functions are compile time constants when used as values, so referring to the same function twice always give the same object, as does referring to a local function declaration twice in the same scope where it was declared.</li> <li>if they refer to the same member method extracted from the same object. Repeatedly extracting an instance method of an object as a function value gives equal, but not necessarily identical, function values.</li> </ul> <p>Different evaluations of function literals never give rise to equal function objects. Each time a function literal is evaluated, it creates a new function value that is not equal to any other function value, not even ones created by the same expression.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">bool operator ==(Object other);</pre><div class="_attribution">
