The iterators of the same iterable can be stepped through independently, but should return the same elements in the same order, as long as the underlying collection isn't changed.</p> <p>Modifying the collection may cause new iterators to produce different elements, and may change the order of existing elements. A <a href="../list-class.html">List</a> specifies its iteration order precisely, so modifying the list changes the iteration order predictably. A hash-based <a href="../set-class.html">Set</a> may change its iteration order completely when adding a new element to the set.</p> <p>Modifying the underlying collection after creating the new iterator may cause an error the next time <a href="../iterator/movenext.html">Iterator.moveNext</a> is called on that iterator. Any <em>modifiable</em> iterable class should specify which operations will break iteration.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">RuneIterator get iterator =&gt; RuneIterator(string);</pre><div class="_attribution">
