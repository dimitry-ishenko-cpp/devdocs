If any operation tries to access an element that is not an instance of <code>R</code>, the access will throw instead.</p> <p>Elements added to the set (e.g., by using <a href="add.html">add</a> or <a href="addall.html">addAll</a>) must be instances of <code>R</code> to be valid arguments to the adding function, and they must be instances of <code>E</code> as well to be accepted by this set as well.</p> <p>Methods which accept one or more <code>Object?</code> as argument, like <a href="contains.html">contains</a>, <a href="remove.html">remove</a> and <a href="removeall.html">removeAll</a>, will pass the argument directly to the this set's method without any checks. That means that you can do <code>setOfStrings.cast&lt;int&gt;().remove("a")</code> successfully, even if it looks like it shouldn't have any effect.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">Set&lt;R&gt; cast&lt;R&gt;();</pre><div class="_attribution">
