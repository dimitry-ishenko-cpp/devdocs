<p class="_links"><a href="../dart-ffi/dart-ffi-library.html" class="_links-link">dart:ffi</a></p> <h1>NativeFinalizer class  </h1>  <p>A native finalizer which can be attached to Dart objects.</p> <p>When <a href="nativefinalizer/attach.html">attach</a>ed to a Dart object, this finalizer's native callback is called after the Dart object is garbage collected or becomes inaccessible for other reasons.</p> <p>Callbacks will happen as early as possible, when the object becomes inaccessible to the program, and may happen at any moment during execution of the program. At the latest, when an isolate group shuts down, this callback is guaranteed to be called for each object in that isolate group that the finalizer is still attached to.</p> <p>Compared to the <a href="../dart-core/finalizer-class.html">Finalizer</a> from <code>dart:core</code>, which makes no promises to ever call an attached callback, this native finalizer promises that all attached finalizers are definitely called at least once before the program ends, and the callbacks are called as soon as possible after an object is recognized as inaccessible.</p> <p>When the callback is a Dart function rather than a native function, use <a href="../dart-core/finalizer-class.html">Finalizer</a> instead.</p> <p>A native finalizer can be used to close native resources. See the following example.</p> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">/// [Database] enables interacting with the native database.
///
/// After [close] is called, cannot be used to [query].
///

/// means of a native finalizer. Prefer closing manually for timely
/// release of native resources.
