This method simply allows writing the call to <code>streamTransformer.bind</code> in a chained fashion, like</p> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">stream.map(mapping).transform(transformation).toList()</pre> <p>which can be more convenient than calling <code>bind</code> directly.</p> <p>The <code>streamTransformer</code> can return any stream. Whether the returned stream is a broadcast stream or not, and which elements it will contain, is entirely up to the transformation.</p> <p>This method should always be used for transformations which treat the entire stream as representing a single value which has perhaps been split into several parts for transport, like a file being read from disk or being fetched over a network. The transformation will then produce a new stream which transforms the stream's value incrementally (perhaps using <a href="../../dart-convert/converter/startchunkedconversion.html">Converter.startChunkedConversion</a>). The resulting stream may again be chunks of the result, but does not have to correspond to specific events from the source string.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">Stream&lt;S&gt; transform&lt;S&gt;(StreamTransformer&lt;T, S&gt; streamTransformer) {
