If it receives events from its source, they will be buffered until the subscription is resumed. For non-broadcast streams, the underlying source is usually informed about the pause, so it can stop generating events until the subscription is resumed.</p> <p>To avoid buffering events on a broadcast stream, it is better to cancel this subscription, and start to listen again when events are needed, if the intermediate events are not important.</p> <p>If <code>resumeSignal</code> is provided, the stream subscription will undo the pause when the future completes, as if by a call to <a href="resume.html">resume</a>. If the future completes with an error, the stream will still resume, but the error will be considered unhandled and is passed to <a href="../zone/handleuncaughterror.html">Zone.handleUncaughtError</a>.</p> <p>A call to <a href="resume.html">resume</a> will also undo a pause.</p> <p>If the subscription is paused more than once, an equal number of resumes must be performed to resume the stream. Calls to <a href="resume.html">resume</a> and the completion of a <code>resumeSignal</code> are interchangeable - the <a href="pause.html">pause</a> which was passed a <code>resumeSignal</code> may be ended by a call to <a href="resume.html">resume</a>, and completing the <code>resumeSignal</code> may end a different <a href="pause.html">pause</a>.</p> <p>It is safe to <a href="resume.html">resume</a> or complete a <code>resumeSignal</code> even when the subscription is not paused, and the resume will have no effect.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">void pause([Future&lt;void&gt;? resumeSignal]);</pre><div class="_attribution">
