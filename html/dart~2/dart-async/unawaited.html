The Dart linter has an optional <a href="https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/unawaited_futures.html">"unawaited futures" lint</a> which enforces that potential futures (expressions with a static type of <a href="future-class.html">Future</a> or <code>Future?</code>) in asynchronous functions are handled <em>somehow</em>. If a particular future value doesn't need to be awaited, you can call <code>unawaited(...)</code> with it, which will avoid the lint, simply because the expression no longer has type <a href="future-class.html">Future</a>. Using <code>unawaited</code> has no other effect. You should use <code>unawaited</code> to convey the <em>intention</em> of deliberately not waiting for the future.</p> <p>If the future completes with an error, it was likely a mistake to not await it. That error will still occur and will be considered unhandled unless the same future is awaited (or otherwise handled) elsewhere too. Because of that, <code>unawaited</code> should only be used for futures that are <em>expected</em> to complete with a value. You can use <a href="futureextensions/ignore.html">FutureExtensions.ignore</a> if you also don't want to know about errors from this future.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">@Since("2.15")
