The feature was intended to solve a particular problem for existing code, a problem introduced by a breaking change to the platform libraries. The <code>waitFor</code> function is not suitable for general use. The feature has shortcomings that can affect other code running in the same isolate, including:</p> <ul> <li>A function call that looks synchronous may cause other asynchronous events to run before it returns. This is something synchronous code can usually assume not to happen, and some code may have been written to take advantage of that assumed behavior. Such code can fail in unexpected ways.</li> <li>Multiple nested calls to <code>waitFor</code> may block each other since the most recent call always needs to complete before any other call can complete. Judicious use of <code>waitFor</code> is necessary to avoid unexpected deadlocks which wouldn't happen if using <code>await</code> instead. If more than one library in the same program is using <code>waitFor</code>, then it's hard to avoid or control whether such blocking will happen.</li> </ul> <p>The feature is not actively maintained. It will remain as-is to support the original problem it was added to solve, at least until that problem can be solved in some other way.</p> <h2 id="call-semantics">Call semantics</h2> <p>This call does the following:</p> <ul> <li>While <code>future</code> is not completed: <ul> <li>suspends the current execution stack,</li> <li>runs the microtask queue until it is empty,</li> <li>waits until the message queue is not empty,</li> <li>handles messages on the message queue, plus their associated microtasks, until the message queue is empty,</li> <li>resumes the original stack.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>This function breaks the usual promise offered by Dart semantics that message handlers and microtasks run to completion before the next message handler or microtask begins to run. Of particular note is that use of this function in a finally block will allow microtasks and message handlers to run before all finally blocks for an exception have completed, possibly breaking invariants in your program.</p> <p>Use of this function should be considered a last resort when it is not possible to convert a Dart program entirely to an asynchronous style using <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>.</p> <p>If the <a href="../dart-async/future-class.html">Future</a> completes normally, its result is returned. If the <a href="../dart-async/future-class.html">Future</a> completes with an error, the error and stack trace are wrapped in an <a href="../dart-async/asyncerror-class.html">AsyncError</a> and thrown. If a microtask or message handler run during this call results in an unhandled exception, that exception will be propagated as though the microtask or message handler was the only Dart invocation on the stack. That is, unhandled exceptions in a microtask or message handler will skip over stacks suspended in a call to <a class="deprecated" href="waitfor.html">waitFor</a>.</p> <p>If the optional <code>timeout</code> parameter is passed, <a class="deprecated" href="waitfor.html">waitFor</a> throws a <a href="../dart-async/timeoutexception-class.html">TimeoutException</a> if the <a href="../dart-async/future-class.html">Future</a> is not completed within the specified period.</p> <p>Calls to <a class="deprecated" href="waitfor.html">waitFor</a> may be nested. Earlier invocations will not complete until subsequent ones do, but the completion of a subsequent invocation will cause the previous invocation to wake up and check its <a href="../dart-async/future-class.html">Future</a> for completion.</p> <p>Please be aware that nesting calls to <a class="deprecated" href="waitfor.html">waitFor</a> can lead to deadlock if subsequent calls block waiting for a condition that is only satisfied when an earlier call returns.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">@Deprecated(
