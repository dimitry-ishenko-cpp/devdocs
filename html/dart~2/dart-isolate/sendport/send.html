Objects that are identified as immutable (e.g. strings) will be shared whereas all other objects will be copied.</p> <p>The send happens immediately and may have a linear time cost to copy the transitive object graph. The send itself doesn't block (i.e. doesn't wait until the receiver has received the message). The corresponding receive port can receive the message as soon as its isolate's event loop is ready to deliver it, independently of what the sending isolate is doing.</p> <p>Note: Due to an implementation choice the Dart VM made for how closures represent captured state, closures can currently capture more state than they need, which can cause the transitive closure to be larger than needed.
