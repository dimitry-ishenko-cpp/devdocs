The isolate stops operating <em>immediately</em>. It throws if the optional <code>message</code> does not adhere to the limitations on what can be sent from one isolate to another (see <a href="../sendport/send.html">SendPort.send</a> for more details). It also throws if a <code>finalMessagePort</code> is associated with an isolate spawned outside of current isolate group, spawned via <a href="spawnuri.html">spawnUri</a>.</p> <p>If successful, a call to this method does not return. Pending <code>finally</code> blocks are not executed, control flow will not go back to the event loop, scheduled asynchronous asks will never run, and even pending isolate control commands may be ignored. (The isolate will send messages to ports already registered using <a href="addonexitlistener.html">Isolate.addOnExitListener</a>, but no further Dart code will run in the isolate.)</p> <p>If <code>finalMessagePort</code> is provided, and the <code>message</code> can be sent through it (see <a href="../sendport/send.html">SendPort.send</a> for more details), then the message is sent through that port as the final operation of the current isolate. The isolate terminates immediately after that <a href="../sendport/send.html">SendPort.send</a> call returns.</p> <p>If the port is a native port -- one provided by <a href="../receiveport/sendport.html">ReceivePort.sendPort</a> or <a href="../rawreceiveport/sendport.html">RawReceivePort.sendPort</a> -- the system may be able to send this final message more efficiently than normal port communication between live isolates. In these cases this final message object graph will be reassigned to the receiving isolate without copying. Further, the receiving isolate will in most cases be able to receive the message in constant time.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">external static Never exit([SendPort? finalMessagePort, Object? message]);</pre><div class="_attribution">
