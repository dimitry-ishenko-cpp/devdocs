Only use this method as a last resort. Prefer instead to use <code>@anonymous</code> <code>@JS()</code> annotated classes to create map-like objects for JS interop.</p> <p>The argument must be a <a href="../dart-core/map-class.html">Map</a> or <a href="../dart-core/iterable-class.html">Iterable</a>, the contents of which are also deeply converted. Maps are converted into JavaScript objects. Iterables are converted into arrays. Strings, numbers, bools, and <code>@JS()</code> annotated objects are passed through unmodified. Dart objects are also passed through unmodified, but their members aren't usable from JavaScript.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">external dynamic jsify(Object object);</pre><div class="_attribution">
