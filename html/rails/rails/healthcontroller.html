</dl> <section class="description"> <p>Built-in Health Check Endpoint</p> <p>Rails also comes with a built-in health check endpoint that is reachable at the <code>/up</code> path. This endpoint will return a 200 status code if the app has booted with no exceptions, and a 500 status code otherwise.</p> <p>In production, many applications are required to report their status upstream, whether it’s to an uptime monitor that will page an engineer when things go wrong, or a load balancer or Kubernetes controller used to determine a pod’s health. This health check is designed to be a one-size fits all that will work in many situations.</p> <p>While any newly generated Rails applications will have the health check at <code>/up</code>, you can configure the path to be anything you’d like in your <code>"config/routes.rb"</code>:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "healthz" =&gt; "rails/health#show", as: :rails_health_check
end
</pre> <p>The health check will now be accessible via the <code>/healthz</code> path.</p> <p>NOTE: This endpoint does not reflect the status of all of your application’s dependencies, such as the database or Redis cluster. Replace <code>"rails/health#show"</code> with your own controller action if you have application specific needs.</p> <p>Think carefully about what you want to check as it can lead to situations where your application is being restarted due to a third-party service going bad. Ideally, you should design your application to handle those outages gracefully.</p> </section> <section id="5Buntitled-5D" class="documentation-section"> <section id="public-instance-5Buntitled-5D-method-details" class="method-section"> <header> <h3>Public Instance Methods</h3> </header> <div class="method-detail "> <div class="method-header"> <div class="method-heading" id="method-i-show"> <span class="method-name">show</span><span class="method-args">()</span> <a class="method-click-advice">Show source</a> </div> </div> <div class="method-description">
