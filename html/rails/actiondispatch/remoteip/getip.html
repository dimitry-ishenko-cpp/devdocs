  #
  # 2) The client passed one of `Client-Ip` or `X-Forwarded-For`
  #     (whichever the proxy servers weren't using) themselves.
  #
  # Either way, there is no way for us to determine which header is the right one
  # after the fact. Since we have no idea, if we are concerned about IP spoofing
  # we need to give up and explode. (If you're not concerned about IP spoofing you
  # can turn the `ip_spoofing_check` option off.)

  #     - X-Forwarded-For will be a list of IPs, one per proxy, or blank

  #     - REMOTE_ADDR will be the IP that made the request to Rack

end</pre> </div> <p>Sort through the various IP address headers, looking for the IP most likely to be the address of the actual remote client making this request.</p> <p>REMOTE_ADDR will be correct if the request is made directly against the Ruby process, on e.g. Heroku. When the request is proxied by another server like HAProxy or NGINX, the IP address that made the original request will be put in an <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header. If there are multiple proxies, that header may contain a list of IPs. Other proxy services set the <code>Client-Ip</code> header instead, so we check that too.</p> <p>As discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626095448/https://blog.gingerlime.com/2012/rails-ip-spoofing-vulnerabilities-and-protection/">this post about Rails IP Spoofing</a>, while the first IP in the list is likely to be the “originating” IP, it could also have been set by the client maliciously.</p> <p>In order to find the first address that is (probably) accurate, we take the list of IPs, remove known and trusted proxies, and then take the last address left, which was presumably set by one of those proxies.</p>  </div> </div> <div class="method-detail "> <div class="method-header"> <div class="method-heading" id="method-i-to_s"> <span class="method-name">to_s</span><span class="method-args">()</span> <a class="method-click-advice">Show source</a> </div> </div> <div class="method-description">
