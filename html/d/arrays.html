</pre>  <p>A pointer to type <i>T</i> has a value which is a reference (address) to another object of type <i>T</i>. It is commonly called a <i>pointer to T</i>. </p>  <p>If a pointer contains a <i>null</i> value, it is not pointing to a valid object.</p>  <p>When a pointer to <i>T</i> is dereferenced, it must either contain a <i>null</i> value, or point to a valid object of type <i>T</i>.</p>  <b>Implementation Defined:</b> <ol> <li>The behavior when a <i>null</i> pointer is dereferenced. Typically the program will be aborted.</li> </ol>  <b>Undefined Behavior:</b> <ol> <li>Dereferencing a pointer that is not <i>null</i> and does not point to a valid object of type <i>T</i>.</li> </ol>  <b>Best Practices:</b> These are simple pointers to data. Pointers are provided for interfacing with C and for specialized systems work. There is no length associated with it, and so there is no way for the compiler or runtime to do bounds checking, etc., on it. Most conventional uses for pointers can be replaced with dynamic arrays, <code>out</code> and <code>ref</code> parameters, and reference types.   <h3 id="static-arrays">Static Arrays</h3>   <pre data-language="d">int[3] s;
</pre>   <p>Static arrays have a length fixed at compile time. </p>  <p>The total size of a static array cannot exceed 16Mb. </p>  <p>A static array with a dimension of 0 is allowed, but no space is allocated for it. </p>  <p>Static arrays are value types. They are passed to and returned by functions by value. </p>  <b>Best Practices:</b> <ol> <li>Use dynamic arrays for larger arrays.</li> <li>Static arrays with 0 elements are useful as the last member of a variable length struct, or as the degenerate case of a template expansion.</li> <li>Because static arrays are passed to functions by value, a larger array can consume a lot of stack space. Use dynamic arrays instead.</li> </ol>  <h3 id="dynamic-arrays">Dynamic Arrays</h3>   <pre data-language="d">int[] a;
</pre>   <p>Dynamic arrays consist of a length and a pointer to the array data. Multiple dynamic arrays can share all or parts of the array data. </p>  <b>Best Practices:</b> <ol> <li>Use dynamic arrays instead of pointers to arrays as much as practical. Indexing of dynamic arrays are bounds checked, avoiding buffer underflow and overflow problems.</li> </ol>  <h2 id="declarations">Array Declarations</h2>  <p>Declarations appear before the identifier being declared and read right to left, so: </p>   <pre data-language="d">int[] a;      // dynamic array of ints
int[4][3] b;  // array of 3 arrays of 4 ints each
int[][5] c;   // array of 5 dynamic arrays of ints.
int*[]*[3] d; // array of 3 pointers to dynamic arrays of pointers to ints
int[]* e;     // pointer to dynamic array of ints
</pre>   <h2 id="usage">Array Usage</h2>  <p>There are two broad kinds of operations to do on an array - affecting the handle to the array, and affecting the contents of the array. </p>  <p>The handle to an array is specified by naming the array, as in p, s or a: </p>   <pre data-language="d">int* p;
int[3] s;
int[] a;

int[] b;

p = s.ptr; // p points to the first element of the array s.
p = a.ptr; // p points to the first element of the array a.

a = p;     // error, since the length of the array pointed
           // to by p is unknown
a = s;     // a is initialized to point to the s array
a = b;     // a points to the same array as b does
</pre>   <h2 id="indexing">Indexing</h2>  <p>See also <a href="expression.html#IndexExpression"><i>IndexExpression</i></a>.</p>  <h2 id="slicing">Slicing</h2>  <p><i>Slicing</i> an array means to specify a subarray of it. An array slice does not copy the data, it is only another reference to it. For example: </p>   <pre data-language="d">void foo(int value)
{
  writeln("value=", value);
}

int[10] a;   // declare array of 10 ints
int[] b;

b = a[1..3]; // a[1..3] is a 2 element array consisting of
             // a[1] and a[2]
foo(b[1]);   // equivalent to foo(0)
a[2] = 3;
foo(b[1]);   // equivalent to foo(3)
</pre>   <p>The [] is shorthand for a slice of the entire array. For example, the assignments to b: </p>   <pre data-language="d">int[10] a = [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ];
int[] b1, b2, b3, b4;

b1 = a;
b2 = a[];
b3 = a[0 .. a.length];
b4 = a[0 .. $];
writeln(b1);
writeln(b2);
writeln(b3);
writeln(b4);

</pre>   <p>are all semantically equivalent. </p>  <p>Slicing is not only handy for referring to parts of other arrays, but for converting pointers into bounds-checked arrays: </p>   <pre data-language="d">int[10] a = [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ];

int* p = &amp;a[2];
int[] b = p[0..8];
writeln(b);
writeln(p[7]);      // 10
writeln(p[8]);      // undefined behaviour
writeln(b[7]);      // 10
//writeln(b[8]);    // range error
</pre>   <p>See also <a href="expression.html#SliceExpression"><i>SliceExpression</i></a>.</p>   <h2 id="array-copying">Array Copying</h2>  <p>When the slice operator appears as the left-hand side of an assignment expression, it means that the contents of the array are the target of the assignment rather than a reference to the array. Array copying happens when the left-hand side is a slice, and the right-hand side is an array of or pointer to the same type. </p>   <pre data-language="d">int[3] s;
int[3] t;

s = t;             // the 3 elements of t are copied into s
s[] = t;           // the 3 elements of t are copied into s
s[] = t[];         // the 3 elements of t are copied into s
s[1..2] = t[0..1]; // same as s[1] = t[0]
s[0..2] = t[1..3]; // same as s[0] = t[1], s[1] = t[2]
s[0..4] = t[0..4]; // error, only 3 elements in s
s[0..2] = t;       // error, operands have different lengths
</pre>   <h3 id="overlapping-copying">Overlapping Copying</h3>  <p>Overlapping copies are an error:</p>   <pre data-language="d">s[0..2] = s[1..3]; // error, overlapping copy
s[1..3] = s[0..2]; // error, overlapping copy
</pre>   <p>Disallowing overlapping makes it possible for more aggressive parallel code optimizations than possible with the serial semantics of C. </p>  <p>If overlapping is required, use <a href="https://dlang.org/phobos/std_algorithm_mutation.html#copy"><code>std.algorithm.mutation.copy</code></a>: </p>   <pre data-language="d">import std.algorithm;
int[] s = [1, 2, 3, 4];

copy(s[1..3], s[0..2]);
assert(s == [2, 3, 3, 4]);
</pre>    <h2 id="array-setting">Array Setting</h2>  <p>If a slice operator appears as the left-hand side of an assignment expression, and the type of the right-hand side is the same as the element type of the left-hand side, then the array contents of the left-hand side are set to the right-hand side. </p>   <pre data-language="d">int[3] s;
int* p;

s[] = 3;     // same as s[0] = 3, s[1] = 3, s[2] = 3
p[0..2] = 3; // same as p[0] = 3, p[1] = 3
</pre>   <h2 id="array-concatenation">Array Concatenation</h2>  <p>The binary operator ~ is the <i>cat</i> operator. It is used to concatenate arrays: </p>   <pre data-language="d">int[] a;
int[] b;
int[] c;

a = b ~ c; // Create an array from the concatenation
           // of the b and c arrays
</pre>   <p>Many languages overload the + operator to mean concatenation. This confusingly leads to, does: </p>  <pre data-language="d">"10" + 3 + 4
</pre>  <p>produce the number 17, the string "1034" or the string "107" as the result? It isn't obvious, and the language designers wind up carefully writing rules to disambiguate it - rules that get incorrectly implemented, overlooked, forgotten, and ignored. It's much better to have + mean addition, and a separate operator to be array concatenation. </p>  <p>Similarly, the ~= operator means append, as in: </p>  <pre data-language="d">a ~= b; // a becomes the concatenation of a and b
</pre>  <p>Concatenation always creates a copy of its operands, even if one of the operands is a 0 length array, so: </p>  <pre data-language="d">a = b;           // a refers to b
a = b ~ c[0..0]; // a refers to a copy of b
</pre>  <p>Appending does not always create a copy, see <a href="#resize"> setting dynamic array length</a> for details. </p>  <h2 id="array-operations">Array Operations</h2>  <p>Many array operations, also known as vector operations, can be expressed at a high level rather than as a loop. For example, the loop: </p>  <pre data-language="d">T[] a, b;
...
for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++)
    a[i] = b[i] + 4;
</pre>  <p>assigns to the elements of <code>a</code> the elements of <code>b</code> with <code>4</code> added to each. This can also be expressed in vector notation as: </p>  <pre data-language="d">T[] a, b;
...
a[] = b[] + 4;
</pre>  <p>A vector operation is indicated by the slice operator appearing as the left-hand side of an assignment or an op-assignment expression. The right-hand side can be an expression consisting either of an array slice of the same length and type as the left-hand side or a scalar expression of the element type of the left-hand side, in any combination. </p>  <pre data-language="d">T[] a, b, c;
...
a[] -= (b[] + 4) * c[];
</pre>  <p>The slice on the left and any slices on the right must not overlap. All operands are evaluated exactly once, even if the array slice has zero elements in it. </p>  <p>The order in which the array elements are computed is implementation defined, and may even occur in parallel. An application must not depend on this order. </p>  <p>Implementation note: Many vector operations are expected to take advantage of any vector math instructions available on the target computer. </p>  <h2 id="pointer-arithmetic">Pointer Arithmetic</h2>   <pre data-language="d">int[3] abc;              // static array of 3 ints
int[] def = [ 1, 2, 3 ]; // dynamic array of 3 ints

void dibb(int* array)
{
    array[2];     // means same thing as *(array + 2)
    *(array + 2); // get 3rd element
}

void diss(int[] array)
{
    array[2];     // ok
    *(array + 2); // error, array is not a pointer
}

void ditt(int[3] array)
{
    array[2];     // ok
    *(array + 2); // error, array is not a pointer
}
</pre>   <h2 id="rectangular-arrays">Rectangular Arrays</h2>  <p>Experienced FORTRAN numerics programmers know that multidimensional "rectangular" arrays for things like matrix operations are much faster than trying to access them via pointers to pointers resulting from "array of pointers to array" semantics. For example, the D syntax: </p>   <pre data-language="d">double[][] matrix;
</pre>   <p>declares matrix as an array of pointers to arrays. (Dynamic arrays are implemented as pointers to the array data.) Since the arrays can have varying sizes (being dynamically sized), this is sometimes called "jagged" arrays. Even worse for optimizing the code, the array rows can sometimes point to each other! Fortunately, D static arrays, while using the same syntax, are implemented as a fixed rectangular layout in a contiguous block of memory: </p>   <pre data-language="d">double[6][3] matrix = 0; // Sets all elements to 0.
writeln(matrix); // [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
</pre>   <p>Note that dimensions and indices appear in opposite orders. Dimensions in the <a href="#declarations">declaration</a> are read right to left whereas indices are read left to right: </p>   <pre data-language="d">double[6][3] matrix = 0;
matrix[2][5] = 3.14; // Assignment to bottom right element.
writeln(matrix); // [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.14]]

static assert(!__traits(compiles, matrix[5][2])); // Array index out of bounds.
</pre>   <h2 id="array-length">Array Length</h2>   <p>Within the [ ] of a static or a dynamic array, the symbol <code>$</code> represents the length of the array. </p>    <pre data-language="d">int[4] foo;
int[]  bar = foo;
int*   p = &amp;foo[0];

// These expressions are equivalent:
bar[]
bar[0 .. 4]
bar[0 .. $]
bar[0 .. bar.length]


p[0 .. $]      // '&amp;dollar;' is not defined, since p is not an array
bar[0]+$            // '&amp;dollar;' is not defined, out of scope of [ ]

bar[$-1] // retrieves last element of the array
</pre>   <h2 id="array-properties">Array Properties</h2>  <p>Static array properties are:</p>  <table>

int[3] s;
int[] a;

p.length; // error, length not known for pointer
s.length; // compile time constant 3
a.length; // runtime value

p.dup;    // error, length not known

          // elements s into it
a.dup;    // creates an array of a.length elements, copies
          // elements of a into it
</pre>   <h3 id="resize">Setting Dynamic Array Length</h3>  <p>The <code>.length</code> property of a dynamic array can be set as the left-hand side of an = operator: </p>  <pre data-language="d">array.length = 7;
</pre>  <p>This causes the array to be reallocated in place, and the existing contents copied over to the new array. If the new array length is shorter, the array is not reallocated, and no data is copied. It is equivalent to slicing the array:</p>  <pre data-language="d">array = array[0..7];
</pre>  <p>If the new array length is longer, the remainder is filled out with the default initializer. </p>  <p>To maximize efficiency, the runtime always tries to resize the array in place to avoid extra copying. It will always do a copy if the new size is larger and the array was not allocated via the new operator or resizing in place would overwrite valid data in the array. For example:</p>   <pre data-language="d">char[] a = new char[20];
char[] b = a[0..10];
char[] c = a[10..20];
char[] d = a;

b.length = 15; // always reallocates because extending in place would
               // overwrite other data in a.
b[11] = 'x';   // a[11] and c[1] are not affected

d.length = 1;
d.length = 20; // also reallocates, because doing this will overwrite a and
               // c

c.length = 12; // may reallocate in place if space allows, because nothing
               // was allocated after c.
c[5] = 'y';    // may affect contents of a, but not b or d because those
               // were reallocated.

a.length = 25; // This always reallocates because if c extended in place,
               // then extending a would overwrite c.  If c didn't
               // reallocate in place, it means there was not enough space,
               // which will still be true for a.
a[15] = 'z';   // does not affect c, because either a or c has reallocated.
</pre>    <p>To guarantee copying behavior, use the .dup property to ensure a unique array that can be resized. Also, one may use the <code>.capacity</code> property to determine how many elements can be appended to the array without reallocating. </p>  <p>These issues also apply to appending arrays with the ~= operator. Concatenation using the ~ operator is not affected since it always reallocates. </p>  <p>Resizing a dynamic array is a relatively expensive operation. So, while the following method of filling an array: </p>   <pre data-language="d">int[] array;
while (1)
{
    import core.stdc.stdio : getchar;
    auto c = getchar;
    if (!c)
        break;
    ++array.length;
    array[array.length - 1] = c;
}
</pre>   will work, it will be inefficient. A more practical approach would be to minimize the number of resizes:   <pre data-language="d">int[] array;
array.length = 100;        // guess
int i;
for (i = 0; ; i++)
{
    import core.stdc.stdio : getchar;
    auto c = getchar;
    if (!c)
        break;
    if (i == array.length)
        array.length *= 2;
    array[i] = c;
}
array.length = i;
</pre>   <p>Base selection of the initial size on expected common use cases, which can be determined by instrumenting the code, or simply using good judgement. For example, when gathering user input from the console - it's unlikely to be longer than 80. </p>  <p>The <code>reserve</code> function expands an array's capacity for use by the append operator.</p>   <pre data-language="d">int[] array;
size_t cap = array.reserve(10); // request
array ~= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
assert(cap &gt;= 10); // allocated may be more than request
assert(cap == array.capacity);

If an index is out of bounds, a RangeError exception is raised if detected at runtime, and an error if detected at compile time. A program may not rely on array bounds checking happening, for example, the following program is incorrect: </p>   <pre data-language="d">import core.exception;
try
{
    auto array = [1, 2];
    for (auto i = 0; ; i++)
    {
        array[i] = 5;
    }
}
catch (RangeError)
{
    // terminate loop
}
</pre>   The loop is correctly written:   <pre data-language="d">auto array = [1, 2];
for (auto i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++)
{
    array[i] = 5;

</pre>   <p><code>Implementation Note:</code> Compilers should attempt to detect array bounds errors at compile time, for example: </p>   <pre data-language="d">int[3] foo;
int x = foo[3]; // error, out of bounds
</pre>   <p>Insertion of array bounds checking code at runtime should be turned on and off with a compile time switch. </p>  <b>Undefined Behavior:</b> An out of bounds memory access will cause undefined behavior, therefore array bounds check is normally enabled in <code>@safe</code> functions. The runtime behavior is part of the language semantics.   <p>See also <a href="https://dlang.org/function.html#safe-functions">Safe Functions</a>.</p>  <h3 id="disable-bounds-check">Disabling Array Bounds Checking</h3>  <p>Insertion of array bounds checking code at runtime may be turned off with a compiler switch <a href="https://dlang.org/dmd.html#switch-boundscheck"><code>-boundscheck</code></a>. </p>  <p>If the bounds check in <code>@system</code> or <code>@trusted</code> code is disabled, the code correctness must still be guaranteed by the code author. </p>  <p>On the other hand, disabling the bounds check in <code>@safe</code> code will break the guaranteed memory safety by compiler. It's not recommended unless motivated by speed measurements. </p>  <h2 id="array-initialization">Array Initialization</h2>  <h3 id="default-initialization">Default Initialization</h3>  <ul> <li>Pointers are initialized to <code>null</code>.</li> <li>Static array contents are initialized to the default initializer for the array element type.</li> <li>Dynamic arrays are initialized to having 0 elements.</li> <li>Associative arrays are initialized to having 0 elements.</li> </ul>  <h3 id="void-initialization">Void Initialization</h3>  <p>Void initialization happens when the <i>Initializer</i> for an array is <code>void</code>. What it means is that no initialization is done, i.e. the contents of the array will be undefined. This is most useful as an efficiency optimization. Void initializations are an advanced technique and should only be used when profiling indicates that it matters. </p> <p>to void initialise the elements of dynamic array use <a href="https://dlang.org/phobos/std_array.html#uninitializedArray"><code>std.array.uninitializedArray</code></a>. </p>   <h3 id="static-init-static">Static Initialization of Statically Allocated Arrays</h3>  <p>Static initalizations are supplied by a list of array element values enclosed in [ ].

</pre>   <p>These arrays are statically allocated when they appear in global scope. Otherwise, they need to be marked with <code>const</code> or <code>static</code> storage classes to make them statically allocated arrays.</p>   <h2 id="special-array">Special Array Types</h2>  <h3 id="strings">Strings</h3>  <p>A string is an array of characters. String literals are just an easy way to write character arrays. String literals are immutable (read only). </p>   <pre data-language="d">char[] str1 = "abc";                // error, "abc" is not mutable
char[] str2 = "abc".dup;            // ok, make mutable copy

immutable(char)[] str4 = str1;      // error, str4 is not mutable
immutable(char)[] str5 = str1.idup; // ok, make immutable copy
</pre>   <p>The name <code>string</code> is aliased to <code>immutable(char)[]</code>, so the above declarations could be equivalently written as: </p>   <pre data-language="d">char[] str1 = "abc";     // error, "abc" is not mutable
char[] str2 = "abc".dup; // ok, make mutable copy
string str3 = "abc";     // ok
string str4 = str1;      // error, str4 is not mutable
string str5 = str1.idup; // ok, make immutable copy
</pre>   <p><code>char[]</code> strings are in UTF-8 format. <code>wchar[]</code> strings are in UTF-16 format. <code>dchar[]</code> strings are in UTF-32 format. </p>  <p>Strings can be copied, compared, concatenated, and appended:</p>  <pre data-language="d">str1 = str2;
if (str1 &lt; str3) { ... }
func(str3 ~ str4);
str4 ~= str1;
</pre>  <p>with the obvious semantics. Any generated temporaries get cleaned up by the garbage collector (or by using <code>alloca()</code>). Not only that, this works with any array not just a special String array. </p>  <p>A pointer to a char can be generated: </p>  <pre data-language="d">char* p = &amp;str[3]; // pointer to 4th element
char* p = str;     // pointer to 1st element
</pre>  <p>Since strings, however, are not 0 terminated in D, when transferring a pointer to a string to C, add a terminating 0: </p>  <pre data-language="d">str ~= "\0";
</pre>  or use the function <code>std.string.toStringz</code>.  <p>The type of a string is determined by the semantic phase of compilation. The type is one of: char[], wchar[], dchar[], and is determined by implicit conversion rules. If there are two equally applicable implicit conversions, the result is an error. To disambiguate these cases, a cast or a postfix of <code>c</code>, <code>w</code> or <code>d</code> can be used: </p>  <pre data-language="d">cast(immutable(wchar) [])"abc" // this is an array of wchar characters
"abc"w                         // so is this
</pre>  <p>String literals that do not have a postfix character and that have not been cast can be implicitly converted between string, wstring, and dstring as necessary. </p>   <pre data-language="d">char c;
wchar w;
dchar d;

c = 'b';     // c is assigned the character 'b'
w = 'b';     // w is assigned the wchar character 'b'
//w = 'bc';  // error - only one wchar character at a time
w = "b"[0];  // w is assigned the wchar character 'b'
w = "\r"[0]; // w is assigned the carriage return wchar character
d = 'd';     // d is assigned the character 'd'
</pre>   <h4><span id="strings_unicode">Strings and Unicode</span></h4> <p>Note that built-in comparison operators operate on a <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_unit">code unit</a> basis. The end result for valid strings is the same as that of <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point">code point</a> for <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point">code point</a> comparison as long as both strings are in the same <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#normalization_form">normalization form</a>. Since normalization is a costly operation not suitable for language primitives it's assumed to be enforced by the user. </p> <p>The standard library lends a hand for comparing strings with mixed encodings (by transparently decoding, see <a href="https://dlang.org/phobos/std_algorithm.html#cmp"><code>std.algorithm.cmp</code></a>), <a href="https://dlang.org/phobos/std_uni.html#icmp">case-insensitive comparison</a> and <a href="https://dlang.org/phobos/std_uni.html#normalize">normalization</a>. </p> <p>Last but not least, a desired string sorting order differs by culture and language and is usually nothing like code point for code point comparison. The natural order of strings is obtained by applying <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/">the Unicode collation algorithm</a> that should be implemented in the standard library. </p>  <h4 id="printf">C's printf() and Strings</h4>  <p><code>printf()</code> is a C function and is not part of D. <code>printf()</code> will print C strings, which are 0 terminated. There are two ways to use <code>printf()</code> with D strings. The first is to add a terminating 0, and cast the result to a char*: </p>  <pre data-language="d">str ~= "\0";
printf("the string is '%s'\n", str.ptr);
</pre>  or:  <pre data-language="d">import std.string;
printf("the string is '%s'\n", std.string.toStringz(str));
</pre>  <p>String literals already have a 0 appended to them, so can be used directly:</p>  <pre data-language="d">printf("the string is '%s'\n", "string literal".ptr);
</pre>  <p>So, why does the first string literal to printf not need the <code>.ptr</code>? The first parameter is prototyped as a <code>const(char)*</code>, and a string literal can be implicitly <code>cast</code> to a <code>const(char)*</code>. The rest of the arguments to printf, however, are variadic (specified by ...), and a string literal typed <code>immutable(char)[]</code> cannot pass to variadic parameters.</p>  <p>The second way is to use the precision specifier. The length comes first, followed by the pointer:</p>  <pre data-language="d">printf("the string is '%.*s'\n", str.length, str.ptr);
</pre>  <p>The best way is to use std.stdio.writefln, which can handle D strings:</p>  <pre data-language="d">import std.stdio;
writefln("the string is '%s'", str);
</pre>  <h3 id="void_arrays">Void Arrays</h3>  <p>There is a special type of array which acts as a wildcard that can hold arrays of any kind, declared as <code>void[]</code>. Void arrays are used for low-level operations where some kind of array data is being handled, but the exact type of the array elements are unimportant. The <code>.length</code> of a void array is the length of the data in bytes, rather than the number of elements in its original type. Array indices in indexing and slicing operations are interpreted as byte indices.</p>  <p>Arrays of any type can be implicitly converted to a void array; the compiler inserts the appropriate calculations so that the <code>.length</code> of the resulting array's size is in bytes rather than number of elements. Void arrays cannot be converted back to the original type without using a cast, and it is an error to convert to an array type whose element size does not evenly divide the length of the void array.</p>   <pre data-language="d">void main()
{
    int[] data1 = [1,2,3];
    long[] data2;

    void[] arr = data1;            // OK, int[] implicit converts to void[].
    assert(data1.length == 3);
    assert(arr.length == 12);      // length is implicitly converted to bytes.

    //data1 = arr;                 // Illegal: void[] does not implicitly
                                   // convert to int[].
    int[] data3 = cast(int[]) arr; // OK, can convert with explicit cast.
    data2 = cast(long[]) arr;      // Runtime error: long.sizeof == 8, which
                                   // does not divide arr.length, which is 12
                                   // bytes.
}
</pre>   <p>Void arrays can also be static if their length is known at compile-time. The length is specified in bytes:</p>   <pre data-language="d">void main()
{
    byte[2] x;
    int[2] y;

    void[2] a = x; // OK, lengths match
    void[2] b = y; // Error: int[2] is 8 bytes long, doesn't fit in 2 bytes.
}
</pre>   <p>While it may seem that void arrays are just fancy syntax for <code>ubyte[]</code>, there is a subtle distinction. The garbage collector generally will not scan <code>ubyte[]</code> arrays for pointers, <code>ubyte[]</code> being presumed to contain only pure byte data, not pointers. However, it <i>will</i> scan <code>void[]</code> arrays for pointers, since such an array may have been implicitly converted from an array of pointers or an array of elements that contain pointers. Allocating an array that contains pointers as <code>ubyte[]</code> may run the risk of the GC collecting live memory if these pointers are the only remaining references to their targets.</p>  <h2 id="implicit-conversions">Implicit Conversions</h2>  <p>A pointer <code>T*</code> can be implicitly converted to one of the following:</p>  <ul> <li><code>void*</code></li> </ul>  <p>A static array <code>T[dim]</code> can be implicitly converted to one of the following: </p>  <ul> <li><code>T[]</code></li>  <li><code>const(U)[]</code></li> <li><code>const(U[])</code></li> <li><code>void[]</code></li> </ul>  <p>A dynamic array <code>T[]</code> can be implicitly converted to one of the following (<code>U</code> is a base class of <code>T</code>):</p>  <ul> <li><code>const(U)[]</code></li> <li><code>const(U[])</code></li> <li><code>void[]</code></li> </ul>     <div class="_attribution">
