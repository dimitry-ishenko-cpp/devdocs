Techniques to minimize potential portability problems are: </p>  <ul> <li>The integral and floating type sizes should be considered as minimums. Algorithms should be designed to continue to work properly if the type size increases.</li>  <li>Floating point computations can be carried out at a higher precision than the size of the floating point variable can hold. Floating point algorithms should continue to work properly if precision is arbitrarily increased.</li>  <li>Avoid depending on the order of side effects in a computation that may get reordered by the compiler. For example:  <pre data-language="d">a + b + c
</pre>  <p>can be evaluated as (a + b) + c, a + (b + c), (a + c) + b, (c + b) + a, etc. Parentheses control operator precedence, parentheses do not control order of evaluation. </p>  <p>If the operands of an associative operator + or * are floating point values, the expression is not reordered. </p> </li>  <li>Avoid dependence on byte order; i.e. whether the CPU is big-endian or little-endian.</li>  <li>Avoid dependence on the size of a pointer or reference being the same size as a particular integral type.</li>  <li>If size dependencies are inevitable, put a <code>static assert</code> in the code to verify it:  <pre data-language="d">static assert(int.sizeof == (int*).sizeof);
</pre> </li> </ul>  <h2 id="32_to_64bit">32 to 64 Bit Portability</h2>  <p>64 bit processors and operating systems are here. With that in mind: </p>  <ul> <li>Integral types will remain the same sizes between 32 and 64 bit code.</li>  <li>Pointers and object references will increase in size from 4 bytes to 8 bytes going from 32 to 64 bit code.</li>  <li>Use <code>size_t</code> as an alias for an unsigned integral type that can span the address space. Array indices should be of type <code>size_t</code>.</li>  <li>Use <code>ptrdiff_t</code> as an alias for a signed integral type that can span the address space. A type representing the difference between two pointers should be of type <code>ptrdiff_t</code>.</li>  <li>The <code>.length</code>, <code>.size</code>, <code>.sizeof</code>, <code>.offsetof</code> and <code>.alignof</code> properties will be of type <code>size_t</code>.</li>  </ul>  <h2 id="endianness">Endianness</h2>  <p>Endianness refers to the order in which multibyte types are stored. The two main orders are <i>big endian</i> and <i>little endian</i>. The compiler predefines the version identifier <code>BigEndian</code> or <code>LittleEndian</code> depending on the order of the target system. The x86 systems are all little endian. </p>  <p>The times when endianness matters are:</p>  <ul> <li>When reading data from an external source (like a file) written in a different endian format.</li> <li>When reading or writing individual bytes of a multibyte type like <code>long</code>s or <code>double</code>s.</li> </ul>  <h2 id="os_specific_code">OS Specific Code</h2>  <p>System specific code is handled by isolating the differences into separate modules. At compile time, the correct system specific module is imported. </p>  <p>Minor differences can be handled by constant defined in a system specific import, and then using that constant in an <i>IfStatement</i> or <i>StaticIfStatement</i>. </p>    <div class="_attribution">
