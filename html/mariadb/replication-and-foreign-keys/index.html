<h1>Replication and Foreign Keys</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <div class="cstm-style bluebox text">
<p>The terms <em>master</em> and <em>slave</em> have historically been used in replication, but the terms terms <em>primary</em> and <em>replica</em> are now preferred. The old terms are used still used in parts of the documentation, and in MariaDB commands, although <a href="../what-is-mariadb-105/index.html">MariaDB 10.5</a> has begun the process of renaming. The documentation process is ongoing. See <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18777">MDEV-18777</a> to follow progress on this effort.</p> </div>
<p> Replication is based upon the <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a>. However, cascading deletes or updates based on foreign key relations are an internal mechanism, and are not written to the binary log.</p> <p>Because of this, an identical statement run on the master and the slave may result in different outcomes if the foreign key relations are not identical on both master and slave This could be the case if the storage engine on one supports cascading deletes (e.g. InnoDB) and the storage engine on the other does not (e.g. MyISAM), or the one has specified a foreign key relation, and the other hasn't.</p> <p>Take the following example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE employees (
    x INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(10)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;

CREATE TABLE children (
    y INT PRIMARY KEY,
    f INT,
    name VARCHAR(10),
    FOREIGN KEY fk (f) REFERENCES employees (x)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE = InnoDB;
</pre>
<p>The slave, however, has been set up without InnoDB support, and defaults to MyISAM, so the foreign key restrictions are not in place.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'Yaser'), (2, 'Prune');

INSERT INTO children VALUES (1, 1, 'Haruna'), (2, 1, 'Hera'), (3, 2, 'Eva');
</pre>
<p>At this point, the slave and the master are in sync:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM employees;
+---+-------+
| x | name  |
+---+-------+
| 1 | Yaser |
| 2 | Prune |
+---+-------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

SELECT * FROM children;
+---+------+--------+
| y | f    | name   |
+---+------+--------+
| 1 |    1 | Haruna |
| 2 |    1 | Hera   |
| 3 |    2 | Eva    |
+---+------+--------+
</pre>
<p>However, after:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">DELETE FROM employees WHERE x=1;
</pre>
<p>there are different outcomes on the slave and the master.</p> <p>On the master, the cascading deletes have taken effect:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM children;
+---+------+------+
| y | f    | name |
+---+------+------+
| 3 |    2 | Eva  |
+---+------+------+
</pre>
<p>On the slave, the cascading deletes did not take effect:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM children;
+---+------+--------+
| y | f    | name   |
+---+------+--------+
| 1 |    1 | Haruna |
| 2 |    1 | Hera   |
| 3 |    2 | Eva    |
+---+------+--------+
