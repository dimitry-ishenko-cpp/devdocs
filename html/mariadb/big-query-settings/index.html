<h1>Big Query Settings</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p><a href="../what-is-mariadb-53/index.html">MariaDB 5.3</a> and beyond have a number of features that are targeted at big queries and so are disabled by default.</p> <p>This page describes recommended settings for IO-bound queries that shovel through lots of records.</p> <p>First, turn on <a href="../block-based-join-algorithms/index.html">Batched Key Access</a>: </p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># Turn on disk-ordered reads
optimizer_switch='mrr=on'
optimizer_switch='mrr_cost_based=off'

# Turn on Batched Key Access (BKA)
join_cache_level = 6
</pre>
<p>Give BKA buffer space to operate on. Ideally, it should have enough space to fit all the data examined by the query. </p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># Size limit for the whole join
join_buffer_space_limit = 300M

# Limit for each individual table
join_buffer_size = 100M
</pre>
<p>Turn on <a href="../index_merge_sort_intersection/index.html">index_merge/sort-intersection</a>:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">optimizer_switch='index_merge_sort_intersection=on'
</pre>
<p>If your queries examine big fraction of the tables (somewhere more than ~ 30%), turn on <a href="hash-join.html">hash join</a>:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># Turn on both Hash Join and Batched Key Access
join_cache_level = 8
