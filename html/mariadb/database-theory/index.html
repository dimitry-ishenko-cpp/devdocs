<h1> Database Theory </h1> <div> <div class="creole"> <p>Just as perhaps we take movie special effects for granted until we see what state of the art was in previous eras, so we can't fully appreciate the power of relational databases without seeing what preceded them.</p> <p>Relational databases allow any table to relate to any other table through means of common fields. It is a highly flexible system, and most modern databases are relational.</p> </div> <table>
