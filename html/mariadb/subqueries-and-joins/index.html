<h1>Subqueries and JOINs</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>A <a href="../subqueries/index.html">subquery</a> can quite often, but not in all cases, be rewritten as a <a href="../join/index.html">JOIN</a>.</p>  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="rewriting-subqueries-as-joins">Rewriting Subqueries as JOINS</h2> <p>A subquery using <code>IN</code> can be rewritten with the <code>DISTINCT</code> keyword, for example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1 IN (SELECT col1 FROM table2);
</pre>
<p>can be rewritten as:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1, table2 WHERE table1.col1=table2.col1;
</pre>
<p><code>NOT IN</code> or <code>NOT EXISTS</code> queries can also be rewritten. For example, these two queries returns the same result:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1 NOT IN (SELECT col1 FROM table2);
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT col1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.col1=table2.col1);
</pre>
<p>and both can be rewritten as:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT table1.* FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id WHERE table2.id IS NULL;
</pre>
<p>Subqueries that can be rewritten as a LEFT JOIN are sometimes more efficient.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="using-subqueries-instead-of-joins">Using Subqueries instead of JOINS</h2> <p>There are some scenarios, though, which call for subqueries rather than joins:</p> <ul start="1"><li>When you want duplicates, but not false duplicates. Suppose <code>Table_1</code> has three rows <span>—</span> {<code>1</code>,<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>} <span>—</span> and <code>Table_2</code> has two rows <span>—</span> {<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>,<code>2</code>}. If you need to list the rows in <code>Table_1</code> which are also in <code>Table_2</code>, only this subquery-based <code>SELECT</code> statement will give the right answer (<code>1</code>,<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>): </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT Table_1.column_1 
FROM   Table_1 
WHERE  Table_1.column_1 IN 
  (SELECT Table_2.column_1 
    FROM   Table_2);
</pre>
<ul start="1" style="list-style: none"><li>This SQL statement won't work: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT Table_1.column_1 
FROM   Table_1,Table_2 
WHERE  Table_1.column_1 = Table_2.column_1;
</pre>
<ul start="1" style="list-style: none"><li>because the result will be {<code>1</code>,<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>,<code>2</code>} <span>—</span> and the duplication of 2 is an error. This SQL statement won't work either: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT DISTINCT Table_1.column_1 
FROM   Table_1,Table_2 
WHERE  Table_1.column_1 = Table_2.column_1;
</pre>
<ul start="1" style="list-style: none"><li>because the result will be {<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>} <span>—</span> and the removal of the duplicated 1 is an error too. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>When the outermost statement is not a query. The SQL statement: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">UPDATE Table_1 SET column_1 = (SELECT column_1 FROM Table_2);
</pre>
<ul start="1" style="list-style: none"><li>can't be expressed using a join unless some rare SQL3 features are used. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>When the join is over an expression. The SQL statement: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM Table_1 
WHERE column_1 + 5 =
  (SELECT MAX(column_1) FROM Table_2);
</pre>
<ul start="1" style="list-style: none"><li>is hard to express with a join. In fact, the only way we can think of is this SQL statement: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT Table_1.*
FROM   Table_1, 
      (SELECT MAX(column_1) AS max_column_1 FROM Table_2) AS Table_2
WHERE  Table_1.column_1 + 5 = Table_2.max_column_1;
</pre>
<ul start="1" style="list-style: none"><li>which still involves a parenthesized query, so nothing is gained from the transformation. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>When you want to see the exception. For example, suppose the question is: what books are longer than Das Kapital? These two queries are effectively almost the same: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT DISTINCT Bookcolumn_1.*                     
FROM   Books AS Bookcolumn_1 JOIN Books AS Bookcolumn_2 USING(page_count) 
WHERE  title = 'Das Kapital';

SELECT DISTINCT Bookcolumn_1.* 
FROM   Books AS Bookcolumn_1 
WHERE  Bookcolumn_1.page_count &gt; 
  (SELECT DISTINCT page_count 
  FROM   Books AS Bookcolumn_2 
  WHERE  title = 'Das Kapital');
</pre>
<ul start="1" style="list-style: none"><li>The difference is between these two SQL statements is, if there are two editions of <em>Das Kapital</em> (with different page counts), then the self-join example will return the books which are longer than the shortest edition of <em>Das Kapital</em>. That might be the wrong answer, since the original question didn't ask for "... longer than <code>ANY</code> book named <em>Das Kapital</em>" (it seems to contain a false assumption that there's only one edition).</li></ul> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
