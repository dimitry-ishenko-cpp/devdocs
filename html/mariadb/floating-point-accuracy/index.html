<h1>Floating-point Accuracy</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Due to their nature, not all floating-point numbers can be stored with exact precision. Hardware architecture, the CPU or even the compiler version and optimization level may affect the precision.</p> <p>If you are comparing <a href="../double/index.html">DOUBLEs</a> or <a href="../float/index.html">FLOATs</a> with numeric decimals, it is not safe to use the <a href="../equal/index.html">equality</a> operator.</p> <p>Sometimes, changing a floating-point number from single-precision (FLOAT) to double-precision (DOUBLE) will fix the problem.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="example">Example</h2> <p>f1, f2 and f3 have seemingly identical values across each row, but due to floating point accuracy, the results may be unexpected.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE fpn (id INT, f1 FLOAT, f2 DOUBLE, f3 DECIMAL (10,3));
INSERT INTO fpn VALUES (1,2,2,2),(2,0.1,0.1,0.1);

SELECT * FROM fpn WHERE f1*f1 = f2*f2;
+------+------+------+-------+
| id   | f1   | f2   | f3    |
+------+------+------+-------+
|    1 |    2 |    2 | 2.000 |

<p>The reason why only one instead of two rows was returned becomes clear when we see how the floating point squares were evaluated.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT f1*f1, f2*f2, f3*f3 FROM fpn;
