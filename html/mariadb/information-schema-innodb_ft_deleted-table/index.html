<h1>Information Schema INNODB_FT_DELETED Table</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The <a href="../information_schema/index.html">Information Schema</a> <code>INNODB_FT_DELETED</code> table contains rows that have been deleted from an InnoDB <a href="../full-text-indexes/index.html">fulltext index</a>. This information is then used to filter results on subsequent searches, removing the need to expensively reorganise the index each time a row is deleted.</p> <p>The fulltext index is then only reorganized when an <a href="../optimize-table/index.html">OPTIMIZE TABLE</a> statement is underway. The related <a href="../information-schema-innodb_ft_being_deleted-table/index.html">INNODB_FT_BEING_DELETED</a> table contains rows being deleted while an <code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> is in the process of running.</p> <p>The <code>SUPER</code> <a href="../grant/index.html">privilege</a> is required to view the table, and it also requires the <a href="../innodb-system-variables/index.html#innodb_ft_aux_table">innodb_ft_aux_table</a> system variable to be set.</p> <p>It has the following column:</p> <div class="cstm-style darkheader-nospace-borders">
