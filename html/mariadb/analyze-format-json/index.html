<li>
<strong><code>r_rows</code></strong> is provided for any node that reads rows. It shows how many rows were read, on average </li>
<li>
<strong><code>r_filtered</code></strong> is provided whenever there is a condition that is checked. It shows the percentage of rows left after checking the condition. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="advanced-execution-data">Advanced Execution Data</h2> <p>The most important data not available in the regular tabula <code>ANALYZE</code> statement are:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<strong><code>r_loops</code></strong> field. This shows how many times the node was executed. Most query plan elements have this field. </li>
<li>
<strong><code>r_total_time_ms</code></strong> field. It shows how much time in total, in milliseconds, was spent executing this node. If the node has subnodes, their execution time is included. </li>
<li>
<strong><code>r_buffer_size</code></strong> field. Query plan nodes that make use of buffers report the size of buffer that was was used. </li>

<li>
<strong><code>block-nl-join</code></strong> node has <code>r_loops</code> field, which allows to tell whether <code>Using join buffer</code> was efficient </li>
<li>
<strong><code>range-checked-for-each-record</code></strong> reports counters that show the result of the check. </li>
<li>
<strong><code>expression-cache</code></strong> is used for subqueries, and it reports how many times the cache was used, and what cache hit ratio was. </li>
<li>
<strong><code>union_result</code></strong> node has <code>r_rows</code> so one can see how many rows were produced after UNION operation </li>
