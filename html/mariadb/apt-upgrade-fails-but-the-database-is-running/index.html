<h1>apt-upgrade Fails, But the Database is Running</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>After running <code>apt-upgrade mariadb</code>, it's possible that apt shows a fail in trying to start the server, but in fact the database is up and running, which then provokes apt to remain in a non finished state.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre class="fixed wrap" data-language="sql"># apt-get upgrade

<p>This situation could occur if the timeout for the init script was too short. For example, see <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-9382">MDEV-9382</a>, a situation where the timeout was 30 seconds, but the server was taking 48 seconds to start.</p> <p>To overcome this, the timeout needs to be increased. This can be achieved as follows:</p> <ul start="1"><li>
<strong>On systems where systemd is not enabled/supported:</strong> The timeout can be increased by setting MYSQLD_STARTUP_TIMEOUT either directly in the script or via the command line. In <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10113-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.1.13</a> and later versions, the init script also sources /etc/default/mariadb, so it can also be used to set MYSQLD_STARTUP_TIMEOUT to persistently change the startup timeout. The default timeout has been increased from 30s to 60s in <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10113-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.1.13</a>. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>
<strong>On systems that support systemd</strong>: The startup timeout can be increased by setting <a href="../systemd/index.html">TimeoutStartSec systemd</a> option.</li></ul> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
