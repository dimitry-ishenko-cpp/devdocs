<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h2> <p><code>SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE</code> is a <a href="../select/index.html">SELECT</a> clause which writes the resultset into a single unformatted row, without any separators, in a file. The results will not be returned to the client.</p> <p><em>file_path</em> can be an absolute path, or a relative path starting from the data directory. It can only be specified as a <a href="../string-literals/index.html">string literal</a>, not as a variable. However, the statement can be dynamically composed and executed as a prepared statement to work around this limitation.</p> <p>This statement is binary-safe and so is particularly useful for writing <a href="../blob/index.html">BLOB</a> values to file. It can be used, for example, to copy an image or an audio document from the database to a file. SELECT ... INTO FILE can be used to save a text file.</p> <p>The file must not exist. It cannot be overwritten. A user needs the <a href="../grant/index.html#global-privileges">FILE</a> privilege to run this statement. Also, MariaDB needs permission to write files in the specified location. If the <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#secure_file_priv">secure_file_priv</a> system variable is set to a non-empty directory name, the file can only be written to that directory.</p> <p>Since <a href="../what-is-mariadb-51/index.html">MariaDB 5.1</a>, the <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#character_set_filesystem">character_set_filesystem</a> system variable has controlled interpretation of file names that are given as literal strings.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="example">Example</h2> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT _utf8'Hello world!' INTO DUMPFILE '/tmp/world';

SELECT LOAD_FILE('/tmp/world') AS world;
