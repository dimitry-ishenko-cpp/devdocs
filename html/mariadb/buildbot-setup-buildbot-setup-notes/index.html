<h1>Buildbot Setup Notes</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>General setup instructions are available in the <a href="http://docs.buildbot.net/current/manual/index.html">BuildBot manual</a>, specifically in the section on <a href="http://docs.buildbot.net/current/manual/installation/worker.html">Setting up a build slave</a>.</p> <p>In addition to installing BuildBot on the slave host, it is also necessary to install all the tools needed to branch MariaDB from Launchpad and compile it. It is a good idea to first manually branch the code from Launchpad and successfully build it, as otherwise a lot of time may be needed fixing things one at a time as new builds are started and fail in one way or the other.</p> <p>Unfortunately, bzr is memory hungry, so at least 1 Gigabyte of memory is recommended (you may be able to squeeze through with less, but bzr is a real memory hog). A few Gigabytes of disk space are also needed to hold the build directory.</p> <p>Here are some detailed instructions for various systems:</p> <ul start="1">
