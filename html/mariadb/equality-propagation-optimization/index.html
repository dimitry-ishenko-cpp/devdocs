<h1>Equality propagation optimization</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="basic-idea">Basic idea</h2> <p>Consider a query with a WHERE clause:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">WHERE col1=col2 AND ...
</pre>
<p>the WHERE clause will compute to true only if <code>col1=col2</code>. This means that in the rest of the WHERE clause occurrences of <code>col1</code> can be substituted with <code>col2</code> (with some limitations which are discussed in the next section). This allows the optimizer to infer additional restrictions. </p> <p>For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">WHERE col1=col2 AND col1=123
</pre>
<p>allows to infer a new equality: <code>col2=123</code></p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">WHERE col1=col2 AND col1 &lt; 10 
</pre>
<p>allows to infer that <code>col2&lt;10</code>. </p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="identity-and-comparison-substitution">Identity and comparison substitution</h2> <p>There are some limitations to where one can do the substitution, though.</p> <p>The first and obvious example is the string datatype and collations. Most commonly-used collations in SQL are "case-insensitive", that is <code>'A'='a'</code>. Also, most collations have a "PAD SPACE" attribute, which means that comparison ignores the spaces at the end of the value, <code>'a'='a  '</code>.</p> <p>Now, consider a query:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">INSERT INTO t1 (col1, col2) VALUES ('ab', 'ab   ');
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE col1=col2 AND LENGTH(col1)=2
</pre>
<p>Here, <code>col1=col2</code>, the values are "equal". At the same time <code>LENGTH(col1)=2</code>, while <code>LENGTH(col2)=4</code>, which means one can't perform the substiution for the argument of LENGTH(...). </p> <p>It's not only collations. There are similar phenomena when equality compares columns of different datatypes. The exact criteria of when thy happen are rather convoluted.</p> <p>The take-away is: <strong>sometimes, X=Y does not mean that one can replace any reference to X with Y</strong>. What one CAN do is still replace the occurrence in the comparisons <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, etc.</p> <p>This is how we get two kinds of substitution:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<strong>Identity substitution</strong>: X=Y, and any occurrence of X can be replaced with Y. </li>
<li>
<strong>Comparison substitution</strong>: X=Y, and an occurrence of X in a comparison (X&lt;Z) can be replaced with Y (Y&lt;Z). </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="place-in-query-optimization">Place in query optimization</h2> <p>(A draft description): Let's look at how Equality Propagation is integrated with the rest of the query optimization process.</p> <ul start="1"><li>First, multiple-equalities are built (TODO example from optimizer trace) <ul start="1"><li>If multiple-equality includes a constant, fields are substituted with a constant if possible. </li></ul> </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>From this point, all optimizations like range optimization, ref access, etc make use of multiple equalities: when they see a reference to <code>tableX.columnY</code> somewhere, they also look at all the columns that tableX.columnY is equal to. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>After the join order is picked, the optimizer walks through the WHERE clause and substitutes each field reference with the "best" one - the one that can be checked as soon as possible. <ul start="1"><li>Then, the parts of the WHERE condition are attached to the tables where they can be checked. </li></ul> </li></ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="interplay-with-order-by-optimization">Interplay with ORDER BY optimization</h3> <p>Consider a query:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE col1=col2 ORDER BY col2
</pre>
<p>Suppose, there is an <code>INDEX(col1)</code>. MariaDB optimizer is able to figure out that it can use an index on <code>col1</code> (or sort by the value of <code>col1</code>) in order to resolve <code>ORDER BY col2</code>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="optimizer-trace">Optimizer trace</h2> <p>Look at these elements:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<code>condition_processing</code> </li>
<li>
<code>attaching_conditions_to_tables</code> </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="more-details">More details</h2> <p>Equality propagation doesn't just happen at the top of the WHERE clause. It is done "at all levels" where a level is: </p> <ul start="1">
<li>A top level of the WHERE clause. </li>
<li>If the WHERE clause has an OR clause, each branch of the OR clause. </li>
<li>The top level of any ON expression </li>
<li>(the same as above about OR-levels)</li>
