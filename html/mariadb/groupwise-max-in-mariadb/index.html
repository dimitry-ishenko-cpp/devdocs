<h1>Groupwise Max in MariaDB</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="the-problem">The problem</h2> <p>You want to find the largest row in each group of rows. An example is looking for the largest city in each state. While it is easy to find the MAX(population) ... GROUP BY state, it is hard to find the name of the `city` associated with that `population`. Alas, MySQL and MariaDB do not have any syntax to provide the solution directly.</p> <p>This article is under construction, mostly for cleanup. The content is reasonably accurate during construction.</p> <p>The article presents two "good" solutions. They differ in ways that make neither of them 'perfect'; you should try both and weigh the pros and cons.</p> <p>Also, a few "bad" solutions will be presented, together with why they were rejected.</p> <p>MySQL manual gives 3 solutions; only the "Uncorrelated" one is "good", the other two are "bad".</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="sample-data">Sample data</h2> <p>To show how the various coding attempts work, I have devised this simple task: Find the largest city in each Canadian province.

<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="duplicate-max">Duplicate max</h2> <p>One thing to consider is whether you want -- or do not want -- to see multiple rows for tied winners. For the dataset being used here, that would imply that the two largest cities in a province had identical populations. For this case, a duplicate would be unlikely. But there are many groupwise-max use cases where duplictes are likely.</p> <p>The two best algorithms differ in whether they show duplicates.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="using-an-uncorrelated-subquery">Using an uncorrelated subquery</h2> <p>Characteristics:</p> <ul>
<li>Superior performance or medium performance </li>
<li>It will show duplicates </li>
<li>Needs an extra index </li>
<li>Probably requires 5.6 </li>
<li>If all goes well, it will run in O(M) where M is the number of output rows. </li>
</ul> <p>An 'uncorrelated subquery':</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT  c1.province, c1.city, c1.population
    FROM  Canada AS c1
    JOIN
      ( SELECT  province, MAX(population) AS population
            FROM  Canada
            GROUP BY  province
      ) AS c2 USING (province, population)
    ORDER BY c1.province;
</pre>
<p>But this also 'requires' an extra index: INDEX(province, population). In addition, MySQL has not always been able to use that index effectively, hence the "requires 5.6". (I am not sure of the actual version.)</p> <p>Without that extra index, you would need 5.6, which has the ability to create indexes for subqueries. This is indicated by &lt;auto_key0&gt; in the EXPLAIN. Even so, the performance is worse with the auto-generated index than with the manually generated one.</p> <p>With neither the extra index, nor 5.6, this 'solution' would belong in 'The Duds' because it would run in O(N*N) time.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="using-variables">Using @variables</h2> <p>Characteristics:</p> <ul>
<li>Good performance </li>

<li>Only one scan of the data </li>

<p>Medium performance (2N-3N, depending on join_buffer_size).</p> <p>For O(N*N) time,...
