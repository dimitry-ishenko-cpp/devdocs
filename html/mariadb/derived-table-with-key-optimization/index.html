<h1>Derived Table with Key Optimization</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="the-idea">The idea</h2> <p>If a derived table cannot be merged into its parent SELECT, it will be materialized in a temporary table, and then parent select will treat it as a regular base table.</p> <p>Before <a href="../what-is-mariadb-53/index.html">MariaDB 5.3</a>/MySQL 5.6, the temporary table would never have any indexes, and the only way to read records from it would be a full table scan. Starting from the mentioned versions of the server, the optimizer has an option to create an index and use it for joins with other tables.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="example">Example</h2> <p>Consider a query: we want to find countries in Europe, that have more than one million people living in cities. This is accomplished with this query:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">select * 
from
   Country, 
   (select 
       sum(City.Population) as urban_population, 
       City.Country 
    from City 
    group by City.Country 
    having 
    urban_population &gt; 1*1000*1000
   ) as cities_in_country
where 
  Country.Code=cities_in_country.Country and Country.Continent='Europe';
</pre>
<p>The EXPLAIN output for it will show:</p> <pre class="fixed wrap" data-language="sql">+----+-------------+------------+------+-------------------+-----------+---------+--------------------+------+---------------------------------+

<p>One can see here that </p> <ul start="1">
<li>table <code>&lt;derived2&gt;</code> is accessed through <code>key0</code>. </li>
<li>
<code>ref</code> column shows <code>world.Country.Code</code> </li>
<li>if we look that up in the original query, we find the equality that was used to construct <code>ref</code> access: <code>Country.Code=cities_in_country.Country</code>. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="factsheet">Factsheet</h2> <ul start="1">
<li>The idea of "derived table with key" optimization is to let the materialized derived table have one key which is used for joins with other tables. </li>
<li>The optimization is applied then the derived table could not be merged into its parent SELECT <ul start="1"><li>which happens when the derived table doesn't meet criteria for mergeable VIEW </li></ul> </li>
<li>The optimization is ON by default, it can be switched off like so: </li>
</ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">set optimizer_switch='derived_with_keys=off'
