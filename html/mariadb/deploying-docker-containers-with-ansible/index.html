<h1>Deploying Docker Containers with Ansible</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Ansible can be used to manage Docker container upgrades and configuration changes. Docker has native ways to do this, namely <a href="../creating-a-custom-docker-image/index.html">Dockerfiles</a> and <a href="../setting-up-a-lamp-stack-with-docker-compose/index.html">Docker Compose</a>. But sometimes there are reasons to start basic containers from an image and then manage configuration with Ansible or similar software. See <a href="../benefits-of-managing-docker-containers-with-orchestration-software/index.html">Benefits of Managing Docker Containers with Automation Software</a>.</p> <p>In this page we'll discuss how to use Ansible to manage Docker containers.</p>  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="how-to-deploy-a-container-with-ansible">How to Deploy a Container with Ansible</h2> <p>Ansible has modules to manage the Docker server, Docker containers, and Docker Compose. These modules are maintained by the community.</p> <p>A dynamic inventory plugin for Docker exists. It retrieves the list of existing containers from Docker.</p> <p>Docker modules and the Docker inventory plugin communicate with Docker using its API. The connection to the API can use a TSL connection and supports key authenticity verification.</p> <p>To communicate with Docker API, Ansible needs a proper Python module installed on the Ansible node (<code>docker</code> or <code>docker-py</code>).</p> <p>Several roles exist to deploy Docker and configure it. They can be found in Ansible Galaxy.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="references">References</h2> <p>Further information can be found in Ansible documentation.</p> <ul start="1">
