<strong class="product_title">MariaDB starting with <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1070-release-notes/">10.7.0</a></strong><p>Compressions plugins were added in a <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1070-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.7.0</a> preview release.</p> </div>
<p> The various MariaDB storage engines, such as <a href="../innodb/index.html">InnoDB</a>, <a href="../myrocks/index.html">RocksDB</a>, <a href="../mroonga/index.html">Mroonga</a>, can use different compression libraries. </p> <p>Before <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1070-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.7.0</a>, each separate library would have to be compiled in in order to be available for use, resulting in numerous runtime/rpm/deb dependencies, most of which would never be used by users. </p> <p>From <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1070-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.7.0</a>, five additional MariaDB compression libraries (besides the default zlib) are available as plugins (note that these affect InnoDB and Mroonga only; RocksDB still uses the compression algorithms from its own library):</p> <ul start="1">
<li>bzip2 </li>
<li>lzma </li>
<li>lz4 </li>
<li>lzo </li>
<li>snappy </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="installing">Installing</h2> <p>To use, these simply need to be <a href="../install-soname/index.html">installed as a plugin</a>:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">INSTALL SONAME 'provider_lz4';
</pre>
<p>The compression algorithm can then be used, for example, in <a href="../innodb-page-compression/index.html">InnoDB compression</a>:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SET GLOBAL innodb_compression_algorithm = lz4;
</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2> <p>When upgrading from a release without compression plugins, if a non-zlib compression algorithm was used, those tables will be unreadable until the appropriate compression library is installed. <a href="../mysql_upgrade/index.html">mariadb-upgrade</a> should be run. The <code>--force</code> option (to run <a href="../mysqlcheck/index.html">mariadb-check</a>) or <code>mariadb-check</code> itself will indicate any problems with compression, for example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">Warning  : MariaDB tried to use the LZMA compression, but its provider plugin is not loaded

Error    : Table 'test.t' doesn't exist in engine

status   : Operation failed
</pre>
<p>or</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">Error    : Table test/t is compressed with lzma, which is not currently loaded. 
  Please load the lzma provider plugin to open the table

error    : Corrupt
</pre>
<p>In this case, the appropriate compression plugin should be installed, and the server restarted.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="see-also">See Also</h2> <ul start="1"><li>
