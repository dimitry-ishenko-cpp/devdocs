<h1>Partitioning Limitations with MariaDB</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The following limitations apply to partitioning in MariaDB:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Each table can contain a maximum of 8192 partitions (from <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1004-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.0.4</a>). In <a href="../what-is-mariadb-55/index.html">MariaDB 5.5</a> and until 10.0.3, the limit was 1024. </li>
<li>Currently, queries are never parallelized, even when they involve multiple partitions. </li>
<li>A table can only be partitioned if the storage engine supports partitioning. </li>
<li>All partitions must use the same storage engine. For a workaround, see <a href="../using-connect-partitioning-and-sharding/index.html">Using CONNECT - Partitioning and Sharding</a>. </li>
<li>A partitioned table cannot contain, or be referenced by, <a href="../foreign-keys/index.html">foreign keys</a>. </li>
<li>The <a href="../query-cache/index.html">query cache</a> is not aware of partitioning and partition pruning. Modifying a partition will invalidate the entries related to the whole table. </li>
<li>Updates can run more slowly when binlog_format=ROW and a partitioned table is updated than an equivalent update of a non-partitioned table. </li>
<li>All columns used in the partitioning expression for a partitioned table must be part of every unique key that the table may have.</li>
