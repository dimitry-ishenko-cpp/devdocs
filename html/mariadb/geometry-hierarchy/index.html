<h1>Geometry Hierarchy</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h2> <p>Geometry is the base class. It is an abstract class. The instantiable subclasses of Geometry are restricted to zero-, one-, and two-dimensional geometric objects that exist in two-dimensional coordinate space. All instantiable geometry classes are defined so that valid instances of a geometry class are topologically closed (that is, all defined geometries include their boundary).</p> <p>The base Geometry class has subclasses for Point, Curve, Surface, and GeometryCollection:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<a href="../point/index.html">Point</a> represents zero-dimensional objects. </li>
<li>Curve represents one-dimensional objects, and has subclass <a href="../linestring/index.html">LineString</a>, with sub-subclasses Line and LinearRing. </li>
<li>Surface is designed for two-dimensional objects and has subclass <a href="../polygon/index.html">Polygon</a>. </li>
<li>
<a href="../geometrycollection/index.html">GeometryCollection</a> has specialized zero-, one-, and two-dimensional collection classes named <a href="../multipoint/index.html">MultiPoint</a>, <a href="../multilinestring/index.html">MultiLineString</a>, and <a href="../multipolygon/index.html">MultiPolygon</a> for modeling geometries corresponding to collections of Points, LineStrings, and Polygons, respectively. MultiCurve and MultiSurface are introduced as abstract superclasses that generalize the collection interfaces to handle Curves and Surfaces. </li>
</ul> <p>Geometry, Curve, Surface, MultiCurve, and MultiSurface are defined as non-instantiable classes. They define a common set of methods for their subclasses and are included for extensibility.</p> <p><a href="../point-properties/index.html">Point</a>, <a href="../linestring-properties/index.html">LineString</a>, <a href="../polygon-properties/index.html">Polygon</a>, <a href="../geometrycollection/index.html">GeometryCollection</a>, <a href="../multipoint/index.html">MultiPoint</a>, <a href="../multilinestring/index.html">MultiLineString</a>, and <a href="../multipolygon/index.html">MultiPolygon</a> are instantiable classes.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
