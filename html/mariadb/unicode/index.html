<tr>
<th>Character Set</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr> <tr>
<td>ucs2</td>
<td>UCS-2, each character is represented by a 2-byte code with the most significant byte first. Fixed-length 16-bit encoding.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>utf8</td>
<td>Until <a href="../what-is-mariadb-105/index.html">MariaDB 10.5</a>, this was a UTF-8 encoding using one to three bytes per character. Basic Latin letters, numbers and punctuation use one byte. European and Middle East letters mostly fit into 2 bytes. Korean, Chinese, and Japanese ideographs use 3-bytes. No supplementary characters are stored. From <a href="../what-is-mariadb-106/index.html">MariaDB 10.6</a>, <code>utf8</code> is an alias for <code>utf8mb3</code>, but this can changed to <code>ut8mb4</code> by changing the default value of the <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#old_mode">old_mode</a> system variable.</td>
