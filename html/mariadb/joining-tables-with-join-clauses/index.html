<h1>Joining Tables with JOIN Clauses</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>In the absence of a more tutorial-level document, here is a simple example of three basic JOIN types, which you can experiment with in order to see what the different joins accomplish:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE t1 ( a INT );
CREATE TABLE t2 ( b INT );
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1), (2), (3);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2), (4);
SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.b;
SELECT * FROM t1 CROSS JOIN t2;
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.b;
SELECT * FROM t2 LEFT JOIN t1 ON t1.a = t2.b;
</pre>
<p>The first two SELECTs are (unfortunately) commonly written with an older form:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.b;
SELECT * FROM t1, t2;
</pre>
<p>What you can see from this is that an <strong>INNER JOIN</strong> produces a result set containing only rows that have a match, in both tables (t1 and t2), for the specified join condition(s).</p> <p>A <strong>CROSS JOIN</strong> produces a result set in which every row in each table is joined to every row in the other table; this is also called a <strong>cartesian product</strong>. In MariaDB the CROSS keyword can be omitted, as it does nothing. Any JOIN without an ON clause is a CROSS JOIN.</p> <p>The <strong>LEFT JOIN</strong> is an <strong>outer join</strong>, which produces a result set with all rows from the table on the "left" (t1); the values for the columns in the other table (t2) depend on whether or not a match was found. If no match is found, all columns from that table are set to NULL for that row.</p> <p>The <strong>RIGHT JOIN</strong> is similar to the LEFT JOIN, though its resultset contains all rows from the right table, and the left table's columns will be filled with NULLs when needed.</p> <p>JOINs can be concatenated to read results from three or more tables.</p> <p>Here is the output of the various SELECT statements listed above:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.b;
------ ------ 
| a    | b    |
------ ------ 
|    2 |    2 |
------ ------ 
1 row in set (0.00 sec)


SELECT * FROM t1 CROSS JOIN t2;
------ ------ 
| a    | b    |
------ ------ 
|    1 |    2 |
|    2 |    2 |
|    3 |    2 |
|    1 |    4 |
|    2 |    4 |
|    3 |    4 |
------ ------ 
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)


SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.b;
------ ------ 
| a    | b    |
------ ------ 
|    1 | NULL |
|    2 |    2 |
|    3 | NULL |
------ ------ 
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)


SELECT * FROM t2 LEFT JOIN t1 ON t1.a = t2.b;
------ ------ 
| b    | a    |
------ ------ 
|    2 |    2 |
|    4 | NULL |
------ ------ 
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
