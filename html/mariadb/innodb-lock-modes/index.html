<h1>InnoDB Lock Modes</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> Locks are acquired by a transaction to prevent concurrent transactions from modifying, or even reading, some rows or ranges of rows. This is done to make sure that concurrent write operations never collide.</p> <p><a href="../innodb/index.html">InnoDB</a> supports a number of lock modes.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="shared-and-exclusive-locks">Shared and Exclusive Locks</h2> <p>The two standard row-level locks are <em>share locks</em>(S) and <em>exclusive locks</em>(X).</p> <p>A shared lock is obtained to read a row, and allows other transactions to read the locked row, but not to write to the locked row. Other transactions may also acquire their own shared locks.</p> <p>An exclusive lock is obtained to write to a row, and stops other transactions from locking the same row. It's specific behavior depends on the <a href="../set-transaction-isolation-level/index.html#isolation-level">isolation level</a>; the default (REPEATABLE READ), allows other transactions to read from the exclusively locked row.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="intention-locks">Intention Locks</h2> <p>InnoDB also permits table locking, and to allow locking at both table and row level to co-exist gracefully, a series of locks called <em>intention locks</em> exist. </p> <p>An <em>intention shared lock</em>(IS) indicates that a transaction intends to set a shared lock.</p> <p>An <em>intention exclusive lock</em>(IX) indicates that a transaction intends to set an exclusive lock.</p> <p>Whether a lock is granted or not can be summarised as follows:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>An X lock is not granted if any other lock (X, S, IX, IS) is held. </li>
<li>An S lock is not granted if an X or IX lock is held. It is granted if an S or IS lock is held. </li>
<li>An IX lock is not granted if in X or S lock is held. It is granted if an IX or IS lock is held. </li>
<li>An IS lock is not granted if an X lock is held. It is granted if an S, IX or IS lock is held. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="auto_increment-locks">AUTO_INCREMENT Locks</h2> <p>Locks are also required for auto-increments - see <a href="../auto_increment-handling-in-innodb/index.html">AUTO_INCREMENT handling in InnoDB</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="gap-locks">Gap Locks</h2> <p>With the default <a href="../set-transaction-isolation-level/index.html#isolation-level">isolation level</a>, <code>REPEATABLE READ</code>, and, until <a href="../what-is-mariadb-104/index.html">MariaDB 10.4</a>, the default setting of the <a href="../innodb-system-variables/index.html#innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog">innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog</a> variable, a method called gap locking is used. When InnoDB sets a shared or exclusive lock on a record, it's actually on the index record. Records will have an internal InnoDB index even if they don't have a unique index defined. At the same time, a lock is held on the gap before the index record, so that another transaction cannot insert a new index record in the gap between the record and the preceding record.</p> <p>The gap can be a single index value, multiple index values, or not exist at all depending on the contents of the index.</p> <p>If a statement uses all the columns of a unique index to search for unique row, gap locking is not used. </p> <p>Similar to the shared and exclusive intention locks described above, there can be a number of types of gap locks. These include the shared gap lock, exclusive gap lock, intention shared gap lock and intention exclusive gap lock.</p> <p>Gap locks are disabled if the <a href="../innodb-system-variables/index.html#innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog">innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog</a> system variable is set (until <a href="../what-is-mariadb-104/index.html">MariaDB 10.4</a>), or the <a href="../set-transaction-isolation-level/index.html#isolation-level">isolation level</a> is set to <code>READ COMMITTED</code>.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
