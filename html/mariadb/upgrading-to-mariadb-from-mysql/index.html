<h1>Upgrading to MariaDB From MySQL 5.0 or Older</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>If you upgrade to <a href="../what-is-mariadb-51/index.html">MariaDB 5.1</a> from MySQL 5.1 you <a href="../how-can-i-upgrade-from-mysql-to-mariadb/index.html">don't have to do anything</a> with your data or MySQL clients. Things should "just work".</p> <p>When upgrading between different major versions of MariaDB or MySQL you need to run the <a href="../mysql_upgrade/index.html">mysql_upgrade</a> program to convert data that are incompatible between versions. This will also update your privilege tables in the mysql database to the latest format.</p> <p>In almost all cases <a href="../mysql_upgrade/index.html">mysql_upgrade</a> should be able to convert your tables, without you having to dump and restore your data.</p> <p>After installing MariaDB, just do:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">mysql_upgrade --verbose
</pre>
<p>If you want to run with a specific TCP/IP port do:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">mysql_upgrade --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3308 --protocol=tcp
</pre>
<p>If you want to connect with a socket do:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">mysql_upgrade --socket=127.0.0.1 --protocol=socket
</pre>
<p>To see other options, use <a href="../mysql_upgrade/index.html">--help</a>.</p> <p>"mysql_upgrade" reads the <a href="../mysqld-configuration-files-and-groups/index.html">my.cnf</a> sections [mysql_upgrade] and [client] for default values.</p> <p>There are a variety of reasons tables need to be converted; they could be any of the following:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>The collation (sorting order) for an index column has changed </li>
<li>A field type has changed storage format <ul start="1"><li>
<code><a href="../decimal/index.html">DECIMAL</a></code> and <code><a href="../varchar/index.html">VARCHAR</a></code> changed format between MySQL 4.1 and MySQL 5.0 </li></ul> </li>
<li>An engine has a new storage format <ul start="1"><li>
<a href="../archive/index.html">ARCHIVE</a> changed storage format between 5.0 and 5.1 </li></ul> </li>
<li>The format for storing <a href="../identifier-names/index.html">table names</a> has changed <ul start="1"><li>In MySQL 5.1 table names are encoded so that the file names are identical on all computers. Old table names that contains forbidden file name characters will show up prefixed with #mysql50# in <code>SHOW TABLES</code> until you convert them. </li></ul> </li>
</ul> <p>If you don't convert the tables, one of the following things may happen:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>You will get warnings in the error log every time you access a table with an invalid (old) file name. </li>
<li>When searching on key values you may not find all rows </li>
<li>You will get an error "ERROR 1459 (HY000): Table upgrade required" when accessing the table. </li>
<li>You may get crashes </li>
</ul> <p>"mysql_upgrade" works by calling mysqlcheck with different options and running the "mysql_fix_privileges" script. If you have trouble with "mysql_upgrade", you can run these commands separately to get more information of what is going on.</p> <p>Most of the things in the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/upgrading.html">MySQL 5.1 manual</a> section also applies to MariaDB.</p> <p>The following differences exists between "mysql_upgrade" in MariaDB and MySQL (as of <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-5150-release-notes/">MariaDB 5.1.50</a>):</p> <ul start="1">
<li>MariaDB will convert long table names properly. </li>
<li>MariaDB will convert <a href="../xtradb-and-innodb/index.html">InnoDB</a> tables (no need to do a dump/restore or <code><a href="../alter-table/index.html">ALTER TABLE</a></code>). </li>
<li>MariaDB will convert old archive tables to the new 5.1 format (note: new feature in testing). </li>
<li>"mysql_upgrade --verbose" will run "mysqlcheck --verbose" so that you get more information of what is happening.</li>
