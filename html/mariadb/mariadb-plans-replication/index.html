<p><strong>Note:</strong> This page is obsolete. The information is old, outdated, or otherwise currently incorrect. We are keeping the page for historical reasons only. <strong>Do not</strong> rely on the information in this article.</p> </div> <p>We are discussing points for the replication part of the MariaDB roadmap.</p> <p>So far discussed:</p> <ul start="1"><li>
<del>Replication filters, like --replicate-do-db and friends, need to be possible to change dynamically, without having to restart the server. Having to stop the slave should ideally also not be needed, but is less of a problem.</del> (complete) </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>
<del>Transactional storage of slave state, rather than file-based master.info and relay-log.info . So the slave can recover consistently after a crash.</del> (complete) </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>
<del>Global transaction ID, so the slave state becomes recoverable, and facilitate automatic moving a slave to a new master across multi-level hierarchies.</del> (complete) </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>
<del>Support in global transaction ID for master_pos_wait()</del> (complete) </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Hooks around rotation of the binlog, so user can configure shell commands when a new log is started and when it is ended. The command must be run asynchroneously, and get the old and new log file name as arguments. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Sending of heartbeats from master to slaves, so slaves starting up can know in finite time where the master is. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Replication APIs, as per <a href="http://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=107">MWL#107</a> <ul start="1">
<li>Most important <a href="http://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=120">MWL#120</a> and <a href="http://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=133">MWL#133</a>, for obtaining and applying events. </li>
<li>Then a mechanism for prioritising transactions.</li>
