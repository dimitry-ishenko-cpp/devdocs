<h1>MyRocks and Group Commit with Binary log</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> MyRocks supports group commit with the <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a> (<a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-11934">MDEV-11934</a>).</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="counter-values-to-watch">Counter Values to Watch</h2> <p>(The following is only necessary if you are studying MyRocks internals)</p> <p>MariaDB's group commit counters are:</p> <p><a href="../replication-and-binary-log-status-variables/index.html#binlog_commits">Binlog_commits</a> - how many transactions were written to the binary log</p> <p><a href="../replication-and-binary-log-status-variables/index.html#binlog_group_commits">Binlog_group_commits</a> - how many group commits happened. (e.g. if each group had two transactions, this will be twice as small as <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-status-variables/index.html#binlog_commits">Binlog_commits</a>)</p> <p>On the RocksDB side, there is one relevant counter: <a href="../myrocks-status-variables/index.html#rocksdb_wal_synced">Rocksdb_wal_synced</a> - How many times RocksDB's WAL file was synced. (TODO: this is after group commit happened, right?)</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="on-the-value-of-rocksdb_wal_group_syncs">On the Value of rocksdb_wal_group_syncs</h2> <p>FB/MySQL-5.6 has a <a href="../myrocks-status-variables/index.html#rocksdb_wal_group_syncs">rocksdb_wal_group_syncs</a> counter (The counter is provided by MyRocks, it is not a view of a RocksDB counter). It is increased in rocksdb_flush_wal() when doing the rdb-&gt;FlushWAL() call.</p> <p>rocksdb_flush_wal() is called by MySQL's Group Commit when it wants to make the effect of several rocksdb_prepare() calls persistent.</p> <p>So, the value of <a href="../myrocks-status-variables/index.html#rocksdb_wal_group_syncs">rocksdb_wal_group_syncs</a> in FB/MySQL-5.6 is similar to <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-status-variables/index.html#binlog_group_commits">Binlog_group_commits</a> in MariaDB.</p> <p>MariaDB doesn't have that call, each rocksdb_prepare() call takes care of being persistent on its own.</p> <p>Because of that, <a href="../myrocks-status-variables/index.html#rocksdb_wal_group_syncs">rocksdb_wal_group_syncs</a> is zero for MariaDB. (Currently, it is only incremented when the binlog is rotated).</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="examples">Examples</h2> <p>So for a workload with concurrency=50, n_queries=10K, one gets </p> <ul start="1">
<li>Binlog_commits=10K </li>
<li>Binlog_group_commits=794 </li>
<li>Rocksdb_wal_synced=8362 </li>
</ul> <p>This is on a RAM disk</p> <p>For a workload with concurrency=50, n_queries=10K, rotating laptop hdd, one gets </p> <ul start="1">
<li>Binlog_commits= 10K </li>
<li>Binlog_group_commits=1403 </li>
<li>Rocksdb_wal_synced=400 </li>
</ul> <p>The test took 38 seconds, Number of syncs was 1400+400=1800, which gives 45 syncs/sec which looks normal for this slow rotating desktop hdd.</p> <p>Note that the WAL was synced fewer times than there were binlog commit groups (?)</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
