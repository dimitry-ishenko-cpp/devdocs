<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h3> <p>HASH partitioning is a form of <a href="../partitioning-tables/index.html">partitioning</a> in which the server takes care of the partition in which to place the data, ensuring an even distribution among the partitions.</p> <p>It requires a column value, or an expression based on a column value, which is hashed, as well as the number of partitions into which to divide the table.</p> <p><em>partitioning_expression</em> needs to return a non-constant, deterministic integer. It is evaluated for each insert and update, so overly complex expressions can lead to performance issues.</p> <p><em>number_of_partitions</em> is a positive integer specifying the number of partitions into which to divide the table. If the <code>PARTITIONS</code> clause is omitted, the default number of partitions is one.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="examples">Examples</h3> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 DATETIME) 
  PARTITION BY HASH(TO_DAYS(c2)) 
  PARTITIONS 5;
