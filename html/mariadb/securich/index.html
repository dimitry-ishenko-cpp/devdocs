<p>SecuRich is a library of <a href="../stored-procedures/index.html">stored procedures</a> that adds security features to MariaDB and MySQL. It is maintained by Darren Cassar, and can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.securich.com/">securich.com</a>.</p> <p>Its main purpose is to emulate <a href="../roles/index.html">roles</a>, but this feature has been supported in the server since <a href="../what-is-mariadb-100/index.html">MariaDB 10.0</a>. However other interesting features are available via SecuRich, such as the ability to block a user, clone a user or set a password that will expire (also supported since <a href="../what-is-mariadb-104/index.html">MariaDB 10.4</a> - see <a href="../user-password-expiry/index.html">User Password Expiry</a>).</p> <p>To use SecuRich features, its stored procedures should be used instead of the usual security-related SQL statements. For example, drop_user() should be used instead of <a href="../drop-user/index.html">DROP USER</a>. However, if a combination of SecuRich procedure and normal SQL statements is used, SecuRich can reconcile its tables with the system tables.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
