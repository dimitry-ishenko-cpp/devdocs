<h1>MyISAM Overview</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The MyISAM storage engine was the default storage engine from MySQL 3.23 until it was replaced as default by <a href="../innodb/index.html">InnoDB</a> in MariaDB and MySQL 5.5. Historically, MyISAM is a replacement for the older ISAM engine, removed in MySQL 4.1.</p> <p>It's a light, non-transactional engine with great performance, is easy to copy between systems and has a small data footprint.</p> <p>You're encouraged to rather use the <a href="../aria/index.html">Aria</a> storage engine for new applications, which has even better performance in most cases and the goal of being crash-safe.</p> <p>A MyISAM table is stored in three files on disk. There's a table definition file with an extension of <code>.frm</code>, a data file with the extension <code>.MYD</code>, and an index file with the extension <code>.MYI</code>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="myisam-features">MyISAM features</h2> <ul>
<li>Does not support <a href="../transactions/index.html">transactions</a>. </li>
<li>Does not support foreign keys. </li>
<li>Supports <a href="../full-text-indexes/index.html">FULLTEXT indexes</a>. </li>
<li>Supports <a href="../gis-functionality/index.html">GIS</a> data types. </li>
<li>Storage limit of 256TB. </li>
<li>Maximum of 64 indexes per table. </li>
<li>Maximum of 32 columns per index. </li>
<li>Maximum index length of 1000 bytes. </li>
<li>Limit of (2<sup>32</sup>)<sup>2</sup> (1.844E+19) rows per table. </li>
<li>Supports large files up to 63-bits in length where the underlying system supports this. </li>
<li>All data is stored with the low byte first, so all files will still work if copied to other systems or other machines. </li>
<li>The data file and the index file can be placed on different devices to improve speed. </li>
<li>Supports table locking, not row locking. </li>
<li>Supports a key buffer that is <a href="../segmented-key-cache/index.html">segmented</a> in MariaDB. </li>
<li>Supports <a href="../concurrent-inserts/index.html">concurrent inserts</a>. </li>
<li>Supports fixed length, dynamic and compressed formats - see <a href="../myisam-storage-formats/index.html">MyISAM Storage Formats</a>. </li>
<li>Numeric index values are stored with the high byte first, which enables more efficient index compression. </li>
<li>Data values are stored with the low byte first, making it mostly machine and operating system independent. The only exceptions are if a machine doesn't use two's-complement signed integers and the IEEE floating-point format. </li>
<li>Can be copied between databases or systems with normal system tools, as long as the files are not open on either system. Use <a href="../flush/index.html">FLUSH_TABLES</a> to ensure files are not in use. </li>
<li>There are a number of tools for working with MyISAM tables. These include: <ul>
<li>
<a href="../mariadb-check/index.html">mariadb-check</a> for checking or repairing </li>
<li>
<a href="../myisamchk/index.html">myisamchk</a> for checking or repairing </li>
<li>
<a href="../myisampack/index.html">myisampack</a> for compressing </li>
</ul> </li>
<li>It is possible to build a <a href="../merge/index.html">MERGE</a> table on the top of one or more MyISAM tables.</li>
