<h1>Triggers and Implicit Locks</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>A <a href="../triggers/index.html">trigger</a> may reference multiple tables, and if a <code><a href="../lock-tables/index.html">LOCK TABLES</a></code> statement is used on one of the tables, other tables may at the same time also implicitly be locked due to the trigger.</p> <p>If the trigger only reads from the other table, that table will be read locked. If the trigger writes to the other table, it will be write locked. If a table is read-locked for reading via <code>LOCK TABLES</code>, but needs to be write-locked because it could be modified by a trigger, a write lock is taken.</p> <p>All locks are acquired together when the <code>LOCK TABLES</code> statement is issued and they are released together on <code>UNLOCK TABLES</code>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="example">Example</h2> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">LOCK TABLE table1 WRITE
</pre>
<p>Assume <code>table1</code> contains the following trigger:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TRIGGER trigger1 AFTER INSERT ON table1 FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO table2 VALUES (1);
  UPDATE table3 SET writes = writes+1
    WHERE id = NEW.id AND EXISTS (SELECT id FROM table4);
END;
</pre>
<p>Not only is <code>table1</code> write locked, <code>table2</code> and <code>table3</code> are also write locked, due to the possible <code><a href="../insert/index.html">INSERT</a></code> and <code><a href="../update/index.html">UPDATE</a></code>, while <code>table4</code> is read locked due to the <code><a href="../select/index.html">SELECT</a></code>.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
