<h1>Installing and Testing SphinxSE with MariaDB</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>To use <a href="../sphinx-storage-engine/index.html">SphinxSE</a> with MariaDB you need to first <a href="../installing-sphinx/index.html">download and install Sphinx</a>.</p> <p>Complete Sphinx documentation is available on the <a href="http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/">Sphinx website</a>. </p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="tips-for-installing-sphinx">Tips for Installing Sphinx</h2> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="libexpat">libexpat</h3> <p>One library we know you will need on Linux before you can install Sphinx is <code>libexpat</code>. If it is not installed, you will get the warning <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">checking for libexpat... not found</code>. On Suse the package is called <code>libexpat-devel</code>, on Ubuntu the package is called <code>libexpat1-dev</code>.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="mariadb-detection">MariaDB detection</h3> <p>If you run into problems with MariaDB not being detected, use the following options:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"> --with-mysql            compile with MySQL support (default is enabled)
 --with-mysql-includes   path to MySQL header files
 --with-mysql-libs       path to MySQL libraries
</pre>
<p>The above will tell the <code>configure</code> script where your MySQL/MariaDB installation is.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="testing-sphinx">Testing Sphinx</h2> <p>After installing Sphinx, you can check that things are working in MariaDB by doing the following:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">cd installation-dir/mysql-test
./mysql-test-run --suite=sphinx
</pre>
<p>If the above test doesn't pass, check the logs in the <code>'var'</code> directory. If there is a problem with the sphinx installation, the reason can probably be found in the log file at: <code>var/log/sphinx.sphinx/searchd/sphinx.log</code>.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
