<h1>Event Limitations</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The following restrictions apply to <a href="../stored-programs-and-views-events/index.html">Events</a>.</p> <ul>
<li>All of the restrictions listed in <a href="../stored-routine-limitations/index.html">Stored Routine Limitations</a>. </li>
<li>Events cannot return a resultset. </li>
<li>Event names are case insensitive, so it's not possible to define two events in the same database if their case insensitive names will match. This restriction has applied since MariaDB/MySQL 5.1.8. If you are upgrading from an older version of MySQL, and have events that could clash, these events need to be renamed before the upgrade. </li>
<li>Events do not support dates beyond the maximum that can be represented in the Unix epoch (2038-01-19). </li>
<li>Events cannot be created, dropped or altered by another stored program, trigger or event. </li>
<li>Events cannot create, drop or alter stored programs or triggers </li>
<li>Event timings cannot be strictly predicted. The intervals MONTH, YEAR_MONTH, QUARTER and YEAR are all resolved in months. All others are resolved in seconds. A delay of up to two seconds is possible in extreme cases, and events scheduled to run at the same second cannot be executed in a given order. The <code>LAST_EXECUTED</code> column in the <code><a href="../information-schema-events-table/index.html">INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS</a></code> table will however always be accurate to within a second. </li>
<li>A new connection is used for each execution of statements within the body of an event, so the session counts for <a href="../server-status-variables/index.html">server status variables</a> such as Com_delete and Com_select will not reflect these. </li>
<li>Because the Event Scheduler depends on grant tables for its functionality, it is automatically disabled when the server is running with <a href="../mariadbd-options/index.html#-skip-grant-tables"><code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--skip-grant-tables</code></a>.</li>
