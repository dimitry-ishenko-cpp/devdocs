<h1>Using and Maintaining the Binary Log</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> See <a href="../overview-of-the-binary-log/index.html">Overview of the Binary Log</a> for a general overview of what the binary log is, and <a href="../activating-the-binary-log/index.html">Activating the Binary Log</a> for how to make sure it's running on your system.</p> <p>For details on using the binary log for replication, see the <a href="../replication/index.html">Replication</a> section.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="purging-log-files">Purging Log Files</h2> <p>To delete all binary log files on the server, run the <a href="../reset-master/index.html">RESET MASTER</a> command. To delete all binary logs before a certain datetime, or up to a certain number, use <a href="../sql-commands-purge-logs/index.html">PURGE BINARY LOGS</a>.</p> <div class="cstm-style graybox">
<p>If a replica is active but has yet to read from a binary log file you attempt to delete, the statement will fail with an error. However, if the replica is not connected and has yet to read from a log file you delete, the file will be deleted, but the replica will be unable to continue replicating once it connects again.</p> </div>
<p>Log files can also be removed automatically with the <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#expire_logs_days">expire_logs_days</a> system variable. This is set to 0 by default (no removal), but can be set to a time, in days, after which a binary log file will be automatically removed. Log files will only be checked for being older than <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#expire_logs_days">expire_logs_days</a> upon log rotation, so if your binary log only fills up slowly and does not reach <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#max_binlog_size">max_binlog_size</a> on a daily basis, you may see older log files still being kept. You can also force log rotation, and so expiry deletes, by running <a href="../flush/index.html">FLUSH BINARY LOGS</a> on a regular basis. Always set <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#expire_logs_days">expire_logs_days</a> higher than any possible replica lag.</p> <p>From <a href="../what-is-mariadb-106/index.html">MariaDB 10.6</a>, the <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#binlog_expire_logs_seconds">binlog_expire_logs_seconds</a> variable allows more precise control over binlog deletion, and takes precedence if both are non-zero.</p> <div class="cstm-style graybox">
<p>If the binary log index file has been removed, or incorrectly manually edited, all of the above forms of purging log files will fail. The .index file is a plain text file, and can be manually recreated or edited so that it lists only the binary log files that are present, in numeric/age order.</p> </div>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="examples">Examples</h3> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'mariadb-bin.000063';

</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="safely-purging-binary-log-files-while-replicating">Safely Purging Binary Log Files While Replicating</h3> <p>To be sure replication is not broken while deleting log files, perform the following steps:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Get a listing of binary log files on the primary by running <a href="../show-binary-logs/index.html">SHOW BINARY LOGS</a>. </li>
<li>Go to each replica server and run <a href="../show-slave-status/index.html">SHOW SLAVE STATUS</a> to check which binary log file each replica is currently reading. </li>
<li>Find the earliest log file still being read by a replica. No log files before this one will be needed. </li>
<li>If you wish, make a backup of the log files to be deleted </li>
<li>Purge all log files before (not including) the file identified above. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="binary-log-format">Binary Log Format</h2> <p>There are three formats for the binary log. The default is statement-based logging, while row-based logging and a mix of the two formats are also possible. See <a href="../binary-log-formats/index.html">Binary Log Formats</a> for a full discussion.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="selectively-logging-to-the-binary-log">Selectively Logging to the Binary Log</h2> <p>By default, all changes to data or data structure are logged. This behavior can be changed by starting the server with the <code>--binlog-ignore-db=database_name</code> or <code>--binlog-do-db=database_name</code> <a href="../mysqld-options-full-list/index.html">options</a>.</p> <p><code>--binlog-ignore-db=database_name</code> specified a database to ignore for logging purposes, while <code>--binlog-do-db=database_name</code> will not log any statements unless they apply to the specified database.</p> <div class="cstm-style graybox">
<p>Neither option accepts comma-delimited lists of multiple databases as an option, since a database name can contain a comma. To apply to multiple databases, use the option multiple times.</p> </div>
<p><code>--binlog-ignore-db=database_name</code> behaves differently depending on whether statement-based or row-based logging is used. For statement-based logging, the server will not log any statement where the <em>default database</em> is database_name. The default database is set with the <a href="../use/index.html">USE</a> statement.</p> <p>Similarly, <code>--binlog-do-db=database_name</code> also behaves differently depending on whether statement-based or row-based logging is used. </p> <p>For statement-based logging, the server will only log statement where the <em>default database</em> is database_name. The default database is set with the <a href="../use/index.html">USE</a> statement.</p> <p>For row-based logging, the server will log any updates to any tables in the named database/s, irrespective of the current database.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="examples">Examples</h3> <p>Assume the server has started with the option <code>--binlog-ignore-db=employees</code>. The following example <em>is</em> logged if statement-based logging is used, and <em>is not</em> logged with row-based logging.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">USE customers;
UPDATE employees.details SET bonus=bonus*1.2;
</pre>
<p>This is because statement-based logging examines the default database, in this case, <code>customers</code>. Since <code>customers</code> is not specified in the ignore list, the statement will be logged. If row-based logging is used, the example will not be logged as updates are written to the tables in the <code>employees</code> database.</p> <p>Assume instead the server started with the option <code>--binlog-do-db=employees</code>. The following example <em>is not</em> logged if statement-based logging is used, and <em>is</em> logged with row-based logging.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">USE customers;
UPDATE employees.details SET bonus=bonus*1.2;
</pre>
<p>This is again because statement-based logging examines the default database, in this case, <code>customers</code>. Since <code>customers</code> is not specified in the do list, the statement will not be logged. If row-based logging is used, the example will be logged as updates are written to the tables in the <code>employees</code> database.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="effects-of-full-disk-errors-on-binary-logging">Effects of Full Disk Errors on Binary Logging</h2> <p>If MariaDB encounters a full disk error while trying to write to a binary log file, then it will keep retrying the write every 60 seconds. Log messages will get written to the error log every 600 seconds. For example:</p> <pre class="fixed wrap" data-language="sql">2018-11-27  2:46:46 140278181563136 [Warning] mysqld: Disk is full writing '/var/lib/mariadb-bin.00001' (Errcode: 28 "No space left on device"). Waiting for someone to free space... (Expect up to 60 secs delay for server to continue after freeing disk space)
2018-11-27  2:46:46 140278181563136 [Warning] mysqld: Retry in 60 secs. Message reprinted in 600 secs
</pre>
<p>However, if MariaDB encounters a full disk error while trying to open a new binary log file, then it will disable binary logging entirely. A log message like the following will be written to the error log:</p> <pre class="fixed wrap" data-language="sql">2018-11-27  3:30:49 140278181563136 [ERROR] Could not open '/var/lib/mariadb-bin.00002 for logging (error 28). Turning logging off for the whole duration of the MySQL server process. To turn it on again: fix the cause, shutdown the MySQL server and restart it.
2018-11-27  3:30:49 140278181563136 [ERROR] mysqld: Error writing file '(null)' (errno: 9 "Bad file descriptor")
2018-11-27  3:30:49 140278181563136 [ERROR] mysqld: Error writing file '(null)' (errno: 28 "No space left on device")
