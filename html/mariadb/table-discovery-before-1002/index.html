<h1>Table Discovery (before 10.0.2)</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <div class="cstm-style redbox">
<p>This page describes the <strong>old</strong> discovery API, created in MySQL for NDB Cluster. It no longer works in MariaDB. New table discovery API is documented <a href="../table-discovery/index.html">here</a>.</p> </div>
<p>There are four parts of it.</p> <p>First, when a server finds that a table (for example, mentioned in the <code>SELECT</code> query) does not exist, it asks every engine whether it knows anything about this table. For this it uses <strong>discover()</strong> method of the handlerton. The method is defined as</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">int discover(handlerton *hton, THD* thd, const char *db, const char *name,
             unsigned char **frmblob, size_t *frmlen);
</pre>
<p>It takes the database and a table name as arguments and is returns 0 if the table exists in the engine and 1 otherwise. If it returned 0, it is supposed to allocate (with <code>my_malloc()</code>) a buffer and store the complete binary image of the <code>.frm</code> file of that table. The server will write it down to disk, creating table's <code>.frm</code>. The output parameters <code>frmblob</code> and <code>frmlen</code> are used to return the information about the buffer to the caller. The caller is responsible for freeing the buffer with <code>my_free()</code>.</p> <p>Second, in some cases the server only wants to know if the table exists, but it does not really need to open it and will not use its <code>.frm</code> file image. Then using the <code>discover()</code> method would be an overkill, and the server uses a lightweight <strong>table_exists_in_engine()</strong> method. This method is defined as</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">int table_exists_in_engine(handlerton *hton, THD* thd,
                           const char *db, const char *name);
</pre>
<p>and it returns one of the <code>HA_ERR_</code> codes, typically <code>HA_ERR_NO_SUCH_TABLE</code> or <code>
HA_ERR_TABLE_EXIST</code>.</p> <p>Third, there can be a situation when the server thinks that the table exists (it found and successfully read the <code>.frm</code> file), but from the engine point of view the <code>.frm</code> file is incorrect. For example, the table was already deleted from the engine, or its definition was modified (again, modified only in the engine). In this case the <code>.frm</code> file is outdated, and the server needs to re-discover the table. The engine conveys this to the server by returning <code>HA_ERR_TABLE_DEF_CHANGED</code> error code from the handler's <strong>open()</strong> method. On receiving this error the server will use the <code>discover()</code> method to get the new <code>.frm</code> image. This also means that <em>after</em> the table is opened, the server does not expect its metadata to change. The engine thus should ensure (with some kind of locking, perhaps) that a table metadata cannot be modified, as long as the table stays opened.</p> <p>And fourth, a user might want to retrieve a list of tables in a specific database. With <code>SHOW TABLES</code> or by quering <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</code> tables. The user expects to see all tables, but the server cannot discover them one by one, because it doesnt know table names. In this case, the server uses a special discovery technique. It is <strong>find_files()</strong> method in the handlerton, defines as</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">int find_files(handlerton *hton, THD *thd,
               const char *db, const char *path,
               const char *wild, bool dir, List&lt;LEX_STRING&gt; *files);
</pre>
<p>and it, typically for Storage Engine API, returns 0 on success and 1 on failure. The arguments mean <code>db</code> - the name of the database, <code>path</code> - the path to it, <code>wild</code> an SQL wildcard pattern (for example, from <code>SHOW TABLES LIKE '...'</code>, and <code>dir</code>, if set, means to discover <em>databases</em> instead of <em>tables</em>.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
