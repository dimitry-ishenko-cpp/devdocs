<h1>Information Schema INNODB_CMPMEM and INNODB_CMPMEM_RESET Tables</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The <code>INNODB_CMPMEM</code> and <code>INNODB_CMPMEM_RESET</code> tables contain status information on compressed pages in the <a href="../innodb-buffer-pool/index.html">buffer pool</a> (see InnoDB <a href="../innodb-storage-formats/index.html#compressed">COMPRESSED</a> format).</p> <p>The <a href="../grant/index.html#global-privileges">PROCESS</a> privilege is required to query this table.</p> <p>These tables contain the following columns:</p> <div class="cstm-style darkheader-nospace-borders">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Column Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>PAGE_SIZE</code></td>
<td>Compressed page size, in bytes. This value is unique in the table; other values are totals which refer to pages of this size.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>BUFFER_POOL_INSTANCE</code></td>
<td>Buffer Pool identifier. From <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1051-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.5.1</a> returns a value of 0, since multiple InnoDB buffer pool instances has been removed.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>PAGES_USED</code></td>
<td>Number of pages of the size <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> which are currently in the buffer pool.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>PAGES_FREE</code></td>
<td>Number of pages of the size <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> which are currently free, and thus are available for allocation. This value represents the buffer pool's fragmentation. A totally unfragmented buffer pool has at most 1 free page.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>RELOCATION_OPS</code></td>
<td>How many times a page of the size <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> has been relocated. This happens when data exceeds a page (because a row must be copied into a new page) and when two pages are merged (because their data shrunk and can now be contained in one page).</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>RELOCATION_TIME</code></td>
<td>Time (in seconds) spent in relocation operations for pages of the size <code>PAGE_SIZE</code>. This column is reset when the <code>INNODB_CMPMEM_RESET</code> table is queried.</td>
</tr> </table> </div>
<p>These tables can be used to measure the effectiveness of InnoDB table compression. When you have to decide a value for <code>KEY_BLOCK_SIZE</code>, you can create more than one version of the table (one for each candidate value) and run a realistic workload on them. Then, these tables can be used to see how the operations performed with different page sizes.</p> <p><code>INNODB_CMPMEM</code> and <code>INNODB_CMPMEM_RESET</code> have the same columns and always contain the same values, but when <code>INNODB_CMPMEM_RESET</code> is queried, the <code>RELOCATION_TIME</code> column from both the tables are cleared. <code>INNODB_CMPMEM_RESET</code> can be used, for example, if a script periodically logs the performances of compression in the last period of time. <code>INNODB_CMPMEM</code> can be used to see the cumulated statistics.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="example">Example</h2> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM information_schema.INNODB_CMPMEM\G
