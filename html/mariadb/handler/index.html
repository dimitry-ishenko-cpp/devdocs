<h1> HANDLER </h1> <div> <div class="creole"> <p>The <code>HANDLER</code> statements give you direct access to reading rows from the storage engine. This is much faster than normal access through <a href="../select/index.html">SELECT</a> as there is less parsing involved and no optimizer involved.</p> <p>You can use <a href="../prepared-statements/index.html">prepared statements</a> for <code>HANDLER READ</code>, which should give you a speed comparable to <a href="../handlersocket/index.html">HandlerSocket</a>.
