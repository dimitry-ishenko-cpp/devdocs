In that case, it is recommended to always set <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/index.html#sync_binlog">sync_binlog=1</a>. If you can't do that, then it is recommended to set <a href="../xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/index.html#innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit">innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</a> to <code>3</code>, rather than <code>1</code>. See <a href="../binary-log-group-commit-and-innodb-flushing-performance/index.html#non-durable-binary-log-settings">Non-durable Binary Log Settings</a> for more information.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="amortizing-disk-flush-costs">Amortizing Disk Flush Costs</h2> <p>After every transaction <a href="../commit/index.html">COMMIT</a>, the server normally has to flush any changes the transaction made to the <a href="../xtradbinnodb-redo-log/index.html">InnoDB redo log</a> and the <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a> to disk (i.e. by calling system calls such as <code>fsync()</code> or <code>fdatasync()</code> or similar). This helps ensure that the data changes made by the transaction are stored durably on the disk. Disk flushing is a time-consuming operation, and can easily impose limits on throughput in terms of the number of transactions-per-second (TPS) which can be committed.</p> <p>The idea with group commit is to amortize the costs of each flush to disk over multiple commits from multiple parallel transactions. For example, if there are 10 transactions trying to commit in parallel, then we can force all of them to be flushed disk at once with a single system call, rather than do one system call for each commit. This can greatly reduce the need for flush operations, and can consequently greatly improve the throughput of transactions-per-second (TPS).</p> <p>However, to see the positive effects of group commit, the workload must have sufficient parallelism. A good rule of thumb is that at least three parallel transactions are needed for group commit to be effective. For example, while the first transaction is waiting for its flush operation to complete, the other two transactions will queue up waiting for their turn to flush their changes to disk. When the first transaction is done, a single system call can be used to flush the two queued-up transactions, saving in this case one of the three system calls.</p> <p>In addition to sufficient parallelism, it is also necessary to have enough transactions per second wanting to commit that the flush operations are a bottleneck. If no such bottleneck exists (i.e. transactions never or rarely need to wait for the flush of another to complete), then group commit will provide little to no improvement.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="changing-group-commit-frequency">Changing Group Commit Frequency</h2> <p>The frequency of group commits can be changed by configuring the <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#binlog_commit_wait_usec">binlog_commit_wait_usec</a> and <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#binlog_commit_wait_count">binlog_commit_wait_count</a> system variables.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="measuring-group-commit-ratio">Measuring Group Commit Ratio</h2> <p>Two status variables are available for checking how effective group commit is at reducing flush overhead. These are the <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-status-variables/index.html#binlog_commits">Binlog_commits</a> and <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-status-variables/index.html#binlog_group_commits">Binlog_group_commits</a> status variables. We can obtain those values with the following query:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW GLOBAL STATUS WHERE Variable_name IN('Binlog_commits', 'Binlog_group_commits');
</pre>
<p><a href="../replication-and-binary-log-status-variables/index.html#binlog_commits">Binlog_commits</a> is the total number of transactions committed to the <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a>.</p> <p><a href="../replication-and-binary-log-status-variables/index.html#binlog_group_commits">Binlog_group_commits</a> is the total number of groups committed to the <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a>. As explained in the previous sections of this page, a group commit is when a group of transactions is flushed to the <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a> together by sharing a single flush system call. When <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/index.html#sync_binlog">sync_binlog=1</a> is set, then this is also the total number of flush system calls executed in the process of flushing commits to the <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a>.</p> <p>Thus the extent to which group commit is effective at reducing the number of flush system calls on the binary log can be determined by the ratio between these two status variables. <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-status-variables/index.html#binlog_commits">Binlog_commits</a> will always be as equal to or greater than <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-status-variables/index.html#binlog_group_commits">Binlog_group_commits</a>. The greater the difference is between these status variables, the more effective group commit was at reducing flush overhead.</p> <p>To calculate the group commit ratio, we actually need the values of these status variables from two snapshots. Then we can calculate the ratio with the following formula:</p> <p><code>transactions/group commit</code> = (<code>Binlog_commits</code> (<em>snapshot2</em>) - <code>Binlog_commits</code> (<em>snapshot1</em>))/(<code>Binlog_group_commits</code> (<em>snapshot2</em>) - <code>Binlog_group_commits</code> (<em>snapshot1</em>))</p> <p>For example, if we had the following first snapshot:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW GLOBAL STATUS WHERE Variable_name IN('Binlog_commits', 'Binlog_group_commits');
+----------------------+-------+
| Variable_name        | Value |
+----------------------+-------+
| Binlog_commits       | 120   |
| Binlog_group_commits | 120   |
+----------------------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>And the following second snapshot:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW GLOBAL STATUS WHERE Variable_name IN('Binlog_commits', 'Binlog_group_commits');
+----------------------+-------+
| Variable_name        | Value |
+----------------------+-------+
| Binlog_commits       | 220   |
| Binlog_group_commits | 145   |
+----------------------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>Then we would have:</p> <p><code>transactions/group commit</code> = (220 - 120) / (145 - 120) = 100 / 25 = 4 <code>transactions/group commit</code></p> <p>If your group commit ratio is too close to 1, then it may help to <a href="index.html#changing-group-commit-frequency">change your group commit frequency</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="use-of-group-commit-with-parallel-replication">Use of Group Commit with Parallel Replication</h2> <p>Group commit is also used to enable <a href="../parallel-replication/index.html#conservative-mode-of-in-order-parallel-replication">conservative mode of in-order parallel replication</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="effects-of-group-commit-on-innodb-performance">Effects of Group Commit on InnoDB Performance</h2> <p>When both <a href="../xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/index.html#innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit">innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1</a> (the default) is set and the <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a> is enabled, there is now one less sync to disk inside InnoDB during commit (2 syncs shared between a group of transactions instead of 3).
