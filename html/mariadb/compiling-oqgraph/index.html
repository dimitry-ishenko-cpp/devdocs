<h1>Compiling OQGRAPH</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>To compile OQGraph v2 you need to have the boost library with the versions not earlier than 1.40 and not later than 1.55 and gcc version not earlier than 4.5.</p> <div class="mariadb_from_10_0_7 mariadb from_10_0_7 product">
<strong class="product_title">MariaDB starting with <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1007-release-notes/">10.0.7</a></strong><p>OQGraph v3 compiles fine with the newer boost libraries, but it additionally needs the Judy library installed.</p> </div>
<p>When all build prerequisites are met, OQGraph is enabled and compiled automatically. To enable or disable OQGRAPH explicitly, see the generic <a href="../specifying-what-plugins-to-build/index.html">plugin build instructions</a>.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="finding-out-why-oqgraph-didnt-compile">Finding Out Why OQGRAPH Didn't Compile</h3> <p>If OQGRAPH gets compiled properly, there should be a file like:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">storage/oqgraph/ha_oqgraph.so
</pre>
<p>If this is not the case, then you can find out if there is any modules missing that are required by OQGRAPH by doing:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">cmake . -LAH | grep -i oqgraph
