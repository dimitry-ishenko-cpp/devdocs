<h1>Why Source RPMs (SRPMs) Aren't Packaged For Some Platforms</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>MariaDB source RPMs (SRPMs) are not packaged on all platforms for which MariaDB RPMs are packaged.</p> <p>The reason is that MariaDB's build process relies heavily on <code><a href="https://cmake.org">cmake</a></code> for a lot of things. In this specific case, MariaDB's build process relies on <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cpack/PackageGenerators">CMake CPack Package Generators</a> to build RPMs. The specific package generator that it uses to build RPMs is called <code><a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/module/CPackRPM.html">CPackRPM</a></code>.</p> <p>Support for source RPMs in <code><a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/module/CPackRPM.html">CPackRPM</a></code> became usable with MariaDB's build system starting from around <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/release/3.10.html">cmake 3.10</a>. This means that we do not produce source RPMs on platforms where the installed <code><a href="https://cmake.org">cmake</a></code> version is older than that.</p> <p>See also <a href="../building-mariadb-from-a-source-rpm/index.html">Building MariaDB from a Source RPM</a>.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
