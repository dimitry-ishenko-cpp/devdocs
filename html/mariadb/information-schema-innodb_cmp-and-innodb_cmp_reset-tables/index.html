<h1>Information Schema INNODB_CMP and INNODB_CMP_RESET Tables</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The <code>INNODB_CMP</code> and <code>INNODB_CMP_RESET</code> tables contain status information on compression operations related to <a href="../innodb-storage-formats/index.html#compressed">compressed XtraDB/InnoDB tables</a>.</p> <p>The <code><a href="../grant/index.html#global-privileges">PROCESS</a></code> privilege is required to query this table.</p> <p>These tables contain the following columns:</p> <div class="cstm-style darkheader-nospace-borders">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Column Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>PAGE_SIZE</code></td>
<td>Compressed page size, in bytes. This value is unique in the table; other values are totals which refer to pages of this size.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>COMPRESS_OPS</code></td>
<td>How many times a page of the size <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> has been compressed. This happens when a new page is created because the compression log runs out of space. This value includes both successful operations and <em>compression failures</em>.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>COMPRESS_OPS_OK</code></td>
<td>How many times a page of the size <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> has been successfully compressed. This value should be as close as possible to <code>COMPRESS_OPS</code>. If it is notably lower, either avoid compressing some tables, or increase the <code>KEY_BLOCK_SIZE</code> for some compressed tables.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>COMPRESS_TIME</code></td>
<td>Time (in seconds) spent to compress pages of the size <code>PAGE_SIZE</code>. This value includes time spent in <em>compression failures</em>.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>UNCOMPRESS_OPS</code></td>
<td>How many times a page of the size <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> has been uncompressed. This happens when an uncompressed version of a page is created in the buffer pool, or when a <em>compression failure</em> occurs.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>UNCOMPRESS_TIME</code></td>
<td>Time (in seconds) spent to uncompress pages of the size <code>PAGE_SIZE</code>.</td>
</tr> </table> </div>
<p>These tables can be used to measure the effectiveness of XtraDB/InnoDB table compression. When you have to decide a value for <code>KEY_BLOCK_SIZE</code>, you can create more than one version of the table (one for each candidate value) and run a realistic workload on them. Then, these tables can be used to see how the operations performed with different page sizes.</p> <p><code>INNODB_CMP</code> and <code>INNODB_CMP_RESET</code> have the same columns and always contain the same values, but when <code>INNODB_CMP_RESET</code> is queried, both the tables are cleared. <code>INNODB_CMP_RESET</code> can be used, for example, if a script periodically logs the performances of compression in the last period of time. <code>INNODB_CMP</code> can be used to see the cumulated statistics.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="examples">Examples</h2> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM information_schema.INNODB_CMP\G
