<h1>MyISAM Storage Formats</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> The <a href="../myisam/index.html">MyISAM</a> storage engine supports three different table storage formats.</p> <p>These are FIXED, DYNAMIC and COMPRESSED. FIXED and DYNAMIC can be set with the ROW FORMAT option in the <a href="../create-table/index.html">CREATE TABLE</a> statement, or will be chosen automatically depending on the columns the table contains. COMPRESSED can only be set via the <a href="../myisampack/index.html">myisampack</a> tool.</p> <p>The <a href="../show-table-status/index.html">SHOW TABLE STATUS</a> statement can be used to see the storage format used by a table. Note that <code>COMPRESSED</code> tables are reported as <code>DYNAMIC</code> in that context.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="fixed-length">Fixed-length</h2> <p>Fixed-length (or static) tables contain records of a fixed-length. Each column is the same length for all records, regardless of the actual contents. It is the default format if a table has no <a href="../blob/index.html">BLOB</a>, <a href="../text/index.html">TEXT</a>, <a href="../varchar/index.html">VARCHAR</a> or <a href="../varbinary/index.html">VARBINARY</a> fields, and no ROW FORMAT is provided. You can also specify a fixed table with ROW_FORMAT=FIXED in the table definition.</p> <div class="cstm-style graybox">
<p>Tables containing BLOB or TEXT fields cannot be FIXED, as by design these are both dynamic fields. However, no error or warning will be raised if you specify FIXED.</p> </div>
<p>Fixed-length tables have a number of characteristics</p> <ul>
<li>fast, since MariaDB will always know where a record begins </li>
<li>easy to repair: <a href="../myisamchk/index.html">myisamchk</a> is always able to recover all rows, except for the last one if it is not entirely written </li>
<li>easy to cache </li>
<li>take up more space than dynamic or compressed tables, as the maximum amount of storage space will be allocated to each record. </li>
<li>reconstructing after a crash is uncomplicated due to the fixed positions </li>
<li>no fragmentation or need to re-organize, unless records have been deleted and you want to free the space up. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="dynamic">Dynamic</h2> <p>Dynamic tables contain records of a variable length. It is the default format if a table has any BLOB, TEXT, VARCHAR or VARBINARY fields, and no ROW FORMAT is provided. You can also specify a DYNAMIC table with ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC in the table definition. If the table contains BLOB or TEXT columns, its format is always DYNAMIC, and the ROW FORMAT option is ignored.</p> <p>Dynamic tables have a number of characteristics</p> <ul>
<li>Each row contains a header indicating the length of the row. </li>
<li>Rows tend to become fragmented easily. UPDATING a record to be longer will likely ensure it is stored in different places on the disk. Use <a href="../optimize-table/index.html">OPTIMIZE TABLE</a> when the fragmentation is too high. </li>
<li>All string columns with a length of four or more are dynamic. </li>
<li>They require much less space than fixed-length tables. </li>
<li>Restoring after a crash is more complicated than with FIXED tables. Some fragments may be lost. </li>
</ul> <p>If a DYNAMIC table has some frequently-accessed fixed-length columns, it could be a good idea to move them into a separate FIXED table to avoid fragmentation.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="compressed">Compressed</h2> <p>Compressed tables are a read-only format, created with the <a href="../myisampack/index.html">myisampack</a> tool. This can be done while the server is running, but external lock must not be disabled. <a href="../myisamchk/index.html">myisamchk</a> is used to uncompress them.</p> <p>Compressed tables have a number of characteristics:</p> <ul>
<li>while the data is read-only, DDL statements such as <a href="../drop-table/index.html">DROP TABLE</a> and <a href="../truncate-table/index.html">TRUNCATE TABLE</a> will still function. </li>
<li>take much less space than fixed or dynamic tables. Each data has usually a 40-70% compression ratio </li>
<li>rows are compressed separately, reducing access overhead. </li>
<li>row headers will be from one to three bytes. </li>
<li>rows can be compressed with different compression types, including <ul>
<li>prefix space compression </li>
<li>suffix space compression </li>
<li>columns with small sets of values are converted to ENUM </li>
<li>numeric zeros are stored with only one bit </li>
<li>integer columns will be reduced to the smallest int type that can hold the contents </li>
</ul> </li>
