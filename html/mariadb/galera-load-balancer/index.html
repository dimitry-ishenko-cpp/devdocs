<h1>Galera Load Balancer</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Galera Load Balancer is a simple Load Balancer specifically designed for <a href="../galera/index.html">Galera Cluster</a>. Like Galera, it only runs on Linux. Galera Load Balancer is developed and mantained by Codership. Documentation is available <a href="http://www.fromdual.com/galera-load-balancer-documentation">on fromdual.com</a>.</p> <p>Galera Load Balancer is inspired by pen, which is a generic TCP load balancer. However, since pen is a generic TCP connections load balancer, the techniques it uses are not well-suited to the particular use case of database servers. Galera Load Balancer is optimized for this type of workload.</p> <p>Several balancing policies are supported. Each node can be assigned a different weight. Nodes with a higher weight are preferred. Depending on the selected policy, other nodes can even be ignored, until the preferred nodes crash.</p> <p>A lightweight daemon called glbd receives the connections from clients and it redirects them to nodes. No specific client exists for this demo: a generic TCP client, like nc, can be used to send administrative commands and read the usage statistics.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
