<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="query-memory-allocation">Query Memory Allocation</h2> <p>There are two variables that dictates how memory are allocated by MariaDB while parsing and executing a query. <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#query_prealloc_size">query_prealloc_size</a> defines the standard buffer for memory used for query execution and <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#query_alloc_block_size">query_alloc_block_size</a> that is size of memory blocks if <code>query_prealloc_size</code> was not big enough. Getting these variables right will reduce memory fragmentation in the server.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="mutex-bottleneck">Mutex Bottleneck</h2> <p>MySQL was designed in the days of single-CPU machines, and designed to be easily ported to many different architectures. Unfortunately, that lead to some sloppiness in how to interlock actions. There are a small number (too small) of "mutexes" to gain access to several critical processes. Of note:</p> <ul>
<li>MyISAM's key_buffer </li>
<li>The Query Cache </li>
<li>InnoDB's buffer_pool With multi-core boxes, the mutex problem is causing performance problems. In general, past 4-8 cores, MySQL gets slower, not faster. MySQL 5.5 and Percona's XtraDB made that somewhat better in InnoDB; the practical limit for cores is more like 32, and performance tends plateaus after that rather than declining. 5.6 claims to scale up to about 48 cores. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="hyperthreading-and-multiple-cores-cpus">HyperThreading and Multiple Cores (CPUs)</h2> <p>Short answers (for older versions of MySQL and MariaDB):</p> <ul>
<li>Turn off HyperThreading </li>
<li>Turn off any cores beyond 8 </li>
<li>HyperThreading is mostly a thing of the past, so this section may not apply. </li>
</ul> <p>HyperThreading is great for marketing, lousy for performance. It involves having two processing units sharing a single hardware cache. If both units are doing the same thing, the cache will be reasonably useful. If the units are doing different things, they will be clobbering each other's cache entries.</p> <p>Furthermore MySQL is not great on using multiple cores. So, if you turn off HT, the remaining cores run a little faster.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="32-bit-os-and-mariadb">32-bit OS and MariaDB</h2> <p>First, the OS (and the hardware?) may conspire to not let you use all 4GB, if that is what you have. If you have more than 4GB of RAM, the excess beyond 4GB is _totally_ inaccessable and unusable on a 32-bit OS.</p> <p>Secondly, the OS probably has a limit on how much RAM it will allow any process to use.</p> <p>Example: FreeBSD's maxdsiz, which defaults to 512MB.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">$ ulimit -a
...
max memory size (kbytes, -m) 524288
</pre>
<p>So, once you have determined how much RAM is available to mysqld, then apply the 20%/70%, but round down some.</p> <p>If you get an error like <code>[ERROR] /usr/libexec/mysqld: Out of memory (Needed xxx bytes)</code>, it probably means that MySQL exceeded what the OS is willing to give it. Decrease the cache settings.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="64-bit-os-with-32-bit-mariadb">64-bit OS with 32-bit MariaDB</h2> <p>The OS is not limited by 4GB, but MariaDB is.</p> <p>If you have at least 4GB of RAM, then maybe these would be good:</p> <ul>
<li>
<a href="../myisam-system-variables/index.html#key_buffer_size">key_buffer_size</a> = 20% of _all_ of RAM, but not more than 3G </li>
<li>
<a href="../xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/index.html#innodb_buffer_pool_size">innodb_buffer_pool_size</a> = 3G </li>
</ul> <p>You should probably upgrade MariaDB to 64-bit.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="64-bit-os-and-mariadb">64-bit OS and MariaDB</h2> <p>MyISAM only: <a href="../myisam-system-variables/index.html#key_buffer_size">key_buffer_size</a>: Use about 20% of RAM.

If you have lots of RAM and are using 5.5 (or later), then consider having multiple pools. Recommend 1-16 <a href="../innodb-system-variables/index.html#innodb_buffer_pool_instances">innodb_buffer_pool_instances</a>, such that each one is no smaller than 1GB. (Sorry, no metric on how much this will help; probably not a lot.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, set <a href="../myisam-system-variables/index.html#key_buffer_size">key_buffer_size</a> = 20M (tiny, but non-zero)</p> <p>If you have a mixture of engines, lower both numbers.</p> <p>max_connections, thread_stack Each "thread" takes some amount of RAM.

If you have <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#max_connections">max_connections</a> = 1000, then you are talking about 200MB, maybe more.

Previously, it was minor tunable variable. Zero will slow down thread (connection) creation. A small (say, 10), non-zero number is good. The setting has essentially no impact on RAM usage.</p> <p>It is the number of extra processes to hang onto. It does not restrict the number of threads; <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#max_connections">max_connections</a> does.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="binary-logs">Binary Logs</h2> <p>If you have turned on <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary logging</a> (via <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#log_bin">log_bin</a>) for replication and/or point-in-time recovery, the system will create binary logs forever. That is, they can slowly fill up the disk. Suggest setting <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#expire_logs_days">expire_logs_days</a> = 14 to keep only 14 days' worth of logs.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="swappiness">Swappiness</h2> <p>RHEL, in its infinite wisdom, decided to let you control how aggressively the OS will pre-emptively swap RAM. This is good in general, but lousy for MariaDB.</p> <p>MariaDB would love for RAM allocations to be reasonably stable -- the caches are (mostly) pre-allocated; the threads, etc, are (mostly) of limited scope. ANY swapping is likely to severely hurt performance of MariaDB.</p> <p>With a high value for swappiness, you lose some RAM because the OS is trying to keep a lot of space free for future allocations (that MySQL is not likely to need).</p> <p>With swappiness = 0, the OS will probably crash rather than swap. I would rather have MariaDB limping than die. The latest recommendation is swappiness = 1. (2015)</p> <p><a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2014/04/28/oom-relation-vm-swappiness0-new-kernel/">More confirmation</a></p> <p>Somewhere in between (say, 5?) might be a good value for a MariaDB-only server.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="numa">NUMA</h2> <p>OK, it's time to complicate the architecture of how a CPU talks to RAM. NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) enters the picture. Each CPU (or maybe socket with several cores) has a part of the RAM hanging off each. This leads to memory access being faster for local RAM, but slower (tens of cycles slower) for RAM hanging off other CPUs.</p> <p>Then the OS enters the picture. In at least one case (RHEL?), two things seem to be done:</p> <ul>
<li>OS allocations are pinned to the 'first' CPU's RAM.] </li>
<li>Other allocations go by default to the first CPU until it is full. </li>
</ul> <p>Now for the problem.</p> <ul>
<li>The OS and MariaDB have allocated all the 'first' RAM. </li>
<li>MariaDB has allocated some of the second RAM. </li>
<li>The OS needs to allocate something. Ouch -- it is out of room in the one CPU where it is willing to allocate its stuff, so it swaps out some of MariaDB. Bad. </li>
</ul> <p>dmesg | grep -i numa # to see if you have numa</p> <p>Probable solution: Configure the BIOS to "interleave" the RAM allocations. This should prevent the premature swapping, at the cost of off-CPU RAM accesses half the time. Well, you have the costly accesses anyway, since you really want to use all of RAM. Older MySQL versions: numactl --interleave=all. Or: <a href="../innodb-system-variables/index.html#innodb_numa_interleave">innodb_numa_interleave</a>=1</p> <p>Another possible solution: Turn numa off (if the OS has a way of doing that)</p> <p>Overall performance loss/gain: A few percent.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="huge-pages">Huge Pages</h2> <p>This is another hardware performance gimmick.</p> <p>For a CPU to access RAM, especially mapping a 64-bit address to somewhere in, say, 128GB or 'real' RAM, the TLB is used. (TLB = Translation Lookup Buffer.) Think of the TLB as a hardware associative memory lookup table; given a 64-bit virtual address, what is the real address.</p> <p>Because it is an associative memory of finite size, sometimes there will be "misses" that require reaching into real RAM to resolve the lookup. This is costly, so should be avoided.</p> <p>Normally, RAM is 'paged' in 4KB pieces; the TLB actually maps the top (64-12) bits into a specific page. Then the bottom 12 bits of the virtual address are carried over intact.</p> <p>For example, 128GB of RAM broken 4KB pages means 32M page-table entries. This is a lot, and probably far exceeds the capacity of the TLB. So, enter the "Huge page" trick.</p> <p>With the help of both the hardware and the OS, it is possible to have some of RAM in huge pages, of say 4MB (instead of 4KB). This leads to far fewer TLB entries, but it means the unit of paging is 4MB for such parts of RAM. Hence, huge pages tend to be non-pagable.</p> <p>Now RAM is broken into pagable and non pagable parts; what parts can reasonably be non pagable? In MariaDB, the <a href="../xtradbinnodb-buffer-pool/index.html">Innodb Buffer Pool</a> is a perfect candidate. So, by correctly configuring these, InnoDB can run a little faster:</p> <ul>
<li>Huge pages enabled </li>
<li>Tell the OS to allocate the right amount (namely to match the buffer_pool) </li>
<li>Tell MariaDB to use huge pages </li>
</ul> <ul><li>
<a href="http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?22,384707,385002">innodb memory usage vs swap</a> </li></ul> <p>That thread has more details on what to look for and what to set.</p> <p>Overall performance gain: A few percent.

I mention it in case you have changed the value to something huge; this would stealing from other possible uses of RAM.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="how-to-set-variables">How to Set Variables</h2> <p>In the text file my.cnf (my.ini on Windows), add or modify a line to say something like</p> <p><a href="../innodb-system-variables/index.html#innodb_buffer_pool_size">innodb_buffer_pool_size</a> = 5G</p> <p>That is, VARIABLE name, "=", and a value. Some abbreviations are allowed, such as M for million (1048576), G for billion.</p> <p>For the server to see it, the settings must be in the "[mysqld]" section of the file.</p> <p>The settings in my.cnf or my.ini will not take effect until you restart the server.</p> <p>Most settings can be changed on the live system by connecting as user root (or other user with SUPER privilege) and doing something like</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SET @@global.key_buffer_size = 77000000;
</pre>
<p>Note: No M or G suffix is allowed here.</p> <p>To see the setting a global VARIABLE do something like</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE "key_buffer_size";
+-----------------+----------+
| Variable_name   | Value    |
+-----------------+----------+
| key_buffer_size | 76996608 |
+-----------------+----------+
</pre>
<p>Note that this particular setting was rounded down to some multiple that MariaDB liked.</p> <p>You may want to do both (SET, and modify my.cnf) in order to make the change immediately and have it so that the next restart (for whatever reason) will again get the value.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="web-server">Web Server</h2> <p>A web server like Apache runs multiple threads. If each thread opens a connection to MariaDB, you could run out of connections. Make sure MaxClients (or equivalent) is set to some civilized number (under 50).</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="tools">Tools</h2> <ul>

</ul> <p>There are several tools that advise on memory. One misleading entry they come up with</p> <p>Maximum possible memory usage: 31.3G (266% of installed RAM)</p> <p>Don't let it scare you -- the formulas used are excessively conservative. They assume all of <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#max_connections">max_connections</a> are in use and active, and doing something memory-intensive.</p> <p>Total fragmented tables: 23 This implies that OPTIMIZE TABLE _might_ help. I suggest it for tables with either a high percentage of "free space" (see SHOW TABLE STATUS) or where you know you do a lot of DELETEs and/or UPDATEs. Still, don't bother to OPTIMIZE too often. Once a month might suffice.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="mysql-57">MySQL 5.7</h2> <p>5.7 stores a lot more information in RAM, leading to the footprint being perhaps half a GB more than 5.6.
