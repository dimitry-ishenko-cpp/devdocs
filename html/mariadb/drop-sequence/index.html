<h1>DROP SEQUENCE</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="syntax">Syntax</h2> <pre class="highlight fixed" data-language="sql">DROP [TEMPORARY] SEQUENCE [IF EXISTS] [/*COMMENT TO SAVE*/]
    sequence_name [, sequence_name] ...</pre> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h2> <p><code>DROP SEQUENCE</code> removes one or more <a href="../sequences/index.html">sequences</a> created with <a href="../create-sequence/index.html">CREATE SEQUENCE</a>. You must have the <code>DROP</code> privilege for each sequence. MariaDB returns an error indicating by name which non-existing tables it was unable to drop, but it also drops all of the tables in the list that do exist.</p> <p>Important: When a table is dropped, user privileges on the table are not automatically dropped. See <a href="../grant/index.html">GRANT</a>.</p> <p>If another connection is using the sequence, a metadata lock is active, and this statement will wait until the lock is released. This is also true for non-transactional tables.</p> <p>For each referenced sequence, DROP SEQUENCE drops a temporary sequence with that name, if it exists. If it does not exist, and the <code>TEMPORARY</code> keyword is not used, it drops a non-temporary sequence with the same name, if it exists. The <code>TEMPORARY</code> keyword ensures that a non-temporary sequence will not accidentally be dropped.</p> <p>Use <code>IF EXISTS</code> to prevent an error from occurring for sequences that do not exist. A NOTE is generated for each non-existent sequence when using <code>IF EXISTS</code>. See <a href="../show-warnings/index.html">SHOW WARNINGS</a>.</p> <p>DROP SEQUENCE requires the <a href="../grant/index.html">DROP privilege</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="notes">Notes</h2> <p>DROP SEQUENCE only removes sequences, not tables. However, <a href="../drop-table/index.html">DROP TABLE</a> can remove both sequences and tables.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="see-also">See Also</h2> <ul start="1">
