<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>A sequence is an object that generates a sequence of numeric values, as specified by the <a href="../create-sequence/index.html">CREATE SEQUENCE</a> statement. </p> <p>CREATE SEQUENCE will create a sequence that generates new values when called with NEXT VALUE FOR sequence_name. It's an alternative to <a href="../auto_increment/index.html">AUTO INCREMENT</a> when one wants to have more control of how the numbers are generated. As the SEQUENCE caches values (up to the CACHE value in the <a href="../create-sequence/index.html">CREATE SEQUENCE</a> statement, by default 1000) it can in some cases be much faster than AUTO INCREMENT. Another benefit is that one can access the last value generated by all used sequences, which solves one of the limitations with <a href="../last_insert_id/index.html">LAST_INSERT_ID()</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="creating-a-sequence">Creating a Sequence</h2> <p>The <a href="../create-sequence/index.html">CREATE SEQUENCE</a> statement is used to create a sequence. Here is an example of a sequence starting at 100, incrementing by 10 each time:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE SEQUENCE s START WITH 100 INCREMENT BY 10;
</pre>
<p>The CREATE SEQUENCE statement, along with defaults, can be viewd with the <a href="../show-create-sequence/index.html">SHOW CREATE SEQUENCE STATEMENT</a>, for example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW CREATE SEQUENCE s\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: s
Create Table: CREATE SEQUENCE `s` start with 100 minvalue 1 maxvalue 9223372036854775806 
  increment by 10 cache 1000 nocycle ENGINE=InnoDB
</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="using-sequence-objects">Using Sequence Objects</h2> <p>To get the <a href="../next-value-for-sequence_name/index.html">next value from a sequence</a>, use</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">NEXT VALUE FOR sequence_name
</pre>
<p>or</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">NEXTVAL(sequence_name)
</pre>
<p>or in Oracle mode (<a href="../sql-mode/index.html">SQL_MODE=ORACLE</a>)</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sequence_name.nextval
</pre>
<p>For <a href="../previous-value-for-sequence_name/index.html">retrieving the last value</a> used by the current connection from a sequence use:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">PREVIOUS VALUE FOR sequence_name
</pre>
<p>or</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">LASTVAL(sequence_name)
</pre>
<p>or in Oracle mode (<a href="../sql-mode/index.html">SQL_MODE=ORACLE</a>)</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sequence_name.currval
</pre>
<p>For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT NEXTVAL(s);
+------------+
| NEXTVAL(s) |
+------------+
|        100 |
+------------+

SELECT NEXTVAL(s);
+------------+
| NEXTVAL(s) |
+------------+
|        110 |
+------------+

SELECT LASTVAL(s);
+------------+
| LASTVAL(s) |
+------------+
|        110 |
+------------+
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="using-sequences-in-default">Using Sequences in DEFAULT</h3> <p>Sequences can be used in DEFAULT:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">create sequence s1;
create table t1 (a int primary key default (next value for s1), b int);
insert into t1 (b) values (1),(2);
select * from t1;
+---+------+
| a | b    |
+---+------+
| 1 |    1 |
| 2 |    2 |
+---+------+
</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="changing-a-sequence">Changing a Sequence</h2> <p>The <a href="../alter-sequence/index.html">ALTER SEQUENCE</a> statement is used for changing sequences. For example, to restart the sequence at another value:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">ALTER SEQUENCE s RESTART 50;

SELECT NEXTVAL(s);
+------------+
| NEXTVAL(s) |
+------------+
|         50 |
+------------+
</pre>
<p>The <a href="../setval/index.html">SETVAL function</a> can also be used to set the next value to be returned for a SEQUENCE, for example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT SETVAL(s, 100);
+----------------+
| SETVAL(s, 100) |
+----------------+
|            100 |
+----------------+
</pre>
<p><code>SETVAL</code> can only be used to increase the sequence value. Attempting to set a lower value will fail, returning NULL:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT SETVAL(s, 50);
+---------------+
| SETVAL(s, 50) |
+---------------+
|          NULL |
+---------------+
</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="dropping-a-sequence">Dropping a Sequence</h2> <p>The <a href="../drop-sequence/index.html">DROP SEQUENCE</a> statement is used to drop a sequence, for example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">DROP SEQUENCE s;
</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="replication">Replication</h2> <p>If one wants to use Sequences in a master-master setup or with Galera one should use <code>INCREMENT=0</code>. This will tell the Sequence to use <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/index.html#auto_increment_increment">auto_increment_increment</a> and <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/index.html#auto_increment_offset">auto_increment_offset</a> to generate unique values for each server.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="standards-compliance">Standards Compliance</h2> <p>MariaDB supports both ANSI SQL and Oracle syntax for sequences.</p> <p>However as <code>SEQUENCE</code> is implemented as a special kind of table, it uses the same namespace as tables. The benefits are that sequences show up in <a href="../show-tables/index.html">SHOW TABLES</a>, and one can also create a sequence with <a href="../create-table/index.html">CREATE TABLE</a> and drop it with <a href="../drop-table/index.html">DROP TABLE</a>. One can <a href="../select/index.html">SELECT</a> from it as from any other table. This ensures that all old tools that work with tables should work with sequences.</p> <p>Since sequence objects act as regular tables in many contexts, they will be affected by <a href="../lock-tables/index.html">LOCK TABLES</a>. This is not the case in other DBMS, such as Oracle, where LOCK TABLE does not affect sequences.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="notes">Notes</h2> <p>One of the goals with the Sequence implementation is that all old tools, such as <a href="../mariadb-dump/index.html">mariadb-dump</a> (previously mysqldump), should work unchanged, while still keeping the normal usage of sequence standard compatibly.</p> <p>To make this possible, <code>sequence</code> is currently implemented as a table with a few exclusive properties.</p> <p>The special properties for sequence tables are:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>A sequence table has always one row. </li>
<li>When one creates a sequence, either with <a href="../create-table/index.html">CREATE TABLE</a> or <a href="../create-sequence/index.html">CREATE SEQUENCE</a>, one row will be inserted. </li>
<li>If one tries to insert into a sequence table, the single row will be updated. This allows <a href="../mariadb-dump/index.html">mariadb-dump</a> to work but also gives the additional benefit that one can change all properties of a sequence with a single insert. New applications should of course also use <code>ALTER SEQUENCE</code>. </li>
<li>
<a href="../update/index.html">UPDATE</a> or <a href="../delete/index.html">DELETE</a> can't be performed on Sequence objects. </li>
<li>Doing a select on the sequence shows the current state of the sequence, except the values that are reserved in the cache. The <code>next_value</code> column shows the next value not reserved by the cache. </li>
<li>
<a href="../flush/index.html">FLUSH TABLES</a> will close the sequence and the next sequence number generated will be according to what's stored in the Sequence object. In effect, this will discard the cached values. </li>
<li>A number of normal table operations work on Sequence tables. See next section. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="table-operations-that-work-with-sequences">Table Operations that Work with Sequences</h2> <ul start="1">
<li>
<a href="../show-create-table/index.html">SHOW CREATE TABLE sequence_name</a>. This shows the table structure that is behind the <code>SEQUENCE</code> including the field names that can be used with <a href="../select/index.html">SELECT</a> or even <a href="../create-table/index.html">CREATE TABLE</a>. </li>
<li>
<a href="../create-table/index.html">CREATE TABLE sequence-structure ... SEQUENCE=1</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="../alter-table/index.html">ALTER TABLE sequence RENAME TO sequence2</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="../rename-table/index.html">RENAME TABLE sequence_name TO new_sequence_name</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="../drop-table/index.html">DROP TABLE sequence_name</a>. This is allowed mainly to get old tools like <a href="../mariadb-dump/index.html">mariadb-dump</a> to work with sequence tables. </li>
<li>
<a href="../show-tables/index.html">SHOW TABLES</a> </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="implementation">Implementation</h2> <p>Internally, sequence tables are created as a normal table without rollback (the <a href="../innodb/index.html">InnoDB</a>, <a href="../aria/index.html">Aria</a> and <a href="../myisam/index.html">MySAM</a> engines support this), wrapped by a sequence engine object. This allowed us to create sequences with almost no performance impact for normal tables. (The cost is one 'if' per insert if the <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a> is enabled).</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="underlying-table-structure">Underlying Table Structure</h2> <p>The following example shows the table structure of sequences and how it can be used as a table.
