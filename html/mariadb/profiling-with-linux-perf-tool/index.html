<h1>Profiling with Linux perf tool</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Linux <code>perf</code> tool can be used to do non-intrusive profiling.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="frequency-based-sampling">Frequency Based Sampling</h2> <p>This mechanism can be used to answer the question, what is MariaDB doing on my CPU.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="recording-a-sample">Recording a sample</h3> <p>Perf records at a high frequency, so only a short recording is sufficient to answer the question. If this is too short adjust the frequency at which perf does its recordings.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sudo perf record -p ${pidof mysqld} -g -o sample.perf -- sleep 5
</pre>
<p>The <code>-g</code> option here records the calling stack. Because seeing time in a mutex function isn't particularly interesting without knowing which mutex it is.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="viewing-a-sample">Viewing a sample</h3> <p>To view a recording, you need the debug symbols for your executable. See <a href="../how-to-produce-a-full-stack-trace-for-mysqld/index.html#obtaining-debugging-symbols-for-your-mysqld-binary">this page</a> on getting the debug symbols available.</p> <p>Changing the ownership of the recording means you can run perf report without sudo.</p> <p>This shows where in the process MariaDB is spending most of its time at the top level. MariaDB uses threads per user connection so this will usually show a significant time in a `handle_connection` function. There are background threads that also run, so this can quickly show if its connection related time or a background thread.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sudo chown $USER: sample.perf
perf report -i sample.perf -g
</pre>
<p>To see which low level functions are consuming the most time, <code>--no-children</code> means that each function listed include only the time that is being spend it this function and excluding the other functions it calls.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">perf report -i sample.perf -g --no-children
</pre>
<p>Expanding out the function shows the complete call stack again. Multiple functions may have called the function you are looking at so there may be a different frequency breakdown.</p> <p>A more complete example of performance analysis using perf is on this <a href="https://www.percona.com/community-blog/2020/02/05/finding-mysql-scaling-problems-using-perf/">Percona community blog article</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="dynamic-tracepoints">Dynamic Tracepoints</h2> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="adding-dynamic-tracepoints">Adding dynamic tracepoints</h3> <p>One can add tracepoints at function entry/exit (and other locations too):</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sudo perf probe -x /path/to/ha_rocksdb.so  --add rocksdb_prepare
sudo perf probe -x /path/to/ha_rocksdb.so  --add rocksdb_prepare%return
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="viewing-the-tracepoints">Viewing the tracepoints</h3> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sudo perf probe -l 
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="running-the-profiler">Running the profiler</h3> <p>Something like:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">perf record -e 'probe_ha_rocksdb:*' -a -- sleep 60
</pre>
<p>Note: <code>-a</code> means system-wide.</p> <p>There's also <code>-p $PID</code> option</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">perf record -e 'probe_ha_rocksdb:*' -p $(pidof mysqld) -- sleep 60
