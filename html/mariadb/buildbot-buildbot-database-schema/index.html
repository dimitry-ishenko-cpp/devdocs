<h1>Buildbot Database Schema</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>This page describes the database schema used by Buildbot to save results from test runs.</p> <p>The idea is to be able to use this data from outside of Buildbot for things like additional web pages presenting test results, or search/data mining facilities for searching for test failures.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="accessing-the-database">Accessing the database</h2> <p>The plan is to make remote database connections available to community members. For this, we need to set up a slave host replicating the master Buildbot database (which would in any case be good to isolate the running Buildbot from possibly high load from queries).</p> <p>However, for now the database access is only available locally on the machine (hasky) running the buildbot master.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="schema">Schema</h2> <p>The most current information about the schema used is available in the file <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">buildbot/process/mtrlogobserver.py</code> in the Buildbot sources. As the code evolves and more kinds of information is made available in the database, the schema might be extended, but the schema description in the source code should always be up-to-date.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="the-codetest_runcode-table">The <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">test_run</code> table</h3> <p>This table has one row for every test run that Buildbot does. Thus, each row corresponds to one cell in the [<a href="http://askmonty.org/buildbot/waterfall">http://askmonty.org/buildbot/waterfall</a> Waterfall display]. The format of the table is as follows:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE test_run(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    branch VARCHAR(100),
    revision VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    platform VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

    KEY (branch, revision),
    KEY (dt),
    KEY (platform, bbnum)
) ENGINE=innodb
</pre>
<ul start="1">
<li>
<strong>id:</strong> Primary key, just an auto_increment id. </li>
<li>
<strong>branch:</strong> This is the name of the bzr branch of the test run. </li>
<li>
<strong>revision:</strong> The Bzr revision number tested. </li>
<li>
<strong>platform:</strong> The name of the builder that ran the test. </li>
<li>
<strong>dt:</strong> Date when the buildbot run was started. </li>
<li>
<strong>bbnum:</strong> The Buildbot '''build number''' which together with <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">platform</code> uniquely identifies a build within Buildbot. </li>
<li>
<strong>typ:</strong> Concise abbreviation describing the kind of test. For example <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">pr</code> for --ps-protocol with row based replication, or <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">nm</code> for normal run with mixed-mode replication. </li>
<li>
<strong>info:</strong> Short textual description of the kind of test run. </li>
</ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="the-codetest_failurecode-table">The <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">test_failure</code> table</h3> <p>This table has one row for every test failure encountered:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE test_failure(

<li>
<strong>test_run_id:</strong> This identifies the test run in which the test failure occured (eg. it is a foreign key to <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">id</code> in table <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">test_run</code>). </li>
<li>
<strong>test_name:</strong> The name of the test that failed, eg. <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">main.information_schema</code>. </li>
<li>
<strong>test_variant:</strong> Some tests are run multiple times in different variants. Ie. many replication tests are run under both statement-based, mixed-mode, and row-based replication. The variant will be 'stmt', 'mix', or 'row' accordingly. For tests that do not have multiple variants, the value will be the empty string (ie. not a <strong>NULL</strong> value). </li>
<li>
<strong>info_text:</strong> This is a short description that mysql-test-run.pl sometimes gives for some kinds of test failures (for example "timeout"). </li>
<li>
<strong>failure_text:</strong> This is the entire output from mysql-test-run.pl concerning this test failure. It usually contains the diff against the result file, a stacktrace for a crash, etc. This is useful to run <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><span class="k">LIKE</span>
</code> queries against when searching for test failures similar to one being investigated. </li>

A typical example of this is a memory leak or a crash during server shutdown.</p> <p>Such a failure can not be attributed to a specific test case, as it could be caused by any of the tests run against the server since last restart, or could even be a general problem not caused by any test case.

<li>
<strong>list_idx:</strong> This is a counter for each test name (ie. it starts over from 0 again for each different value of &lt;code&gt;test_run_id&lt;/code&gt; ''and'' &lt;code&gt;list_id&lt;/code&gt;). </li>
