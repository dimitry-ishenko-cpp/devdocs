<h1>Amazon Web Services (AWS) Key Management Service (KMS) Encryption Plugin Advanced Usage</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <p>This document assumes you've already set up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, created a master key in the Key Management Service (KMS), and have done the basic work to set up the MariaDB AWS KMS plugin. These steps are all described in <a href="../mariadb-enterprise-aws-kms-encryption-plugin-setup-guide/index.html">Amazon Web Services (AWS) Key Management Service (KMS) Encryption Plugin Setup Guide</a>.</p> <p>Ultimately, keeping all the credentials required to read the key on a single host means that a user who has gained access to the host has enough information to read the encrypted files in the datadir, read the encrypted keys from the datadir, interact with AWS KMS to decrypt the encrypted keys, and then used the decrypted keys to decrypt the encrypted data.</p> <p>Theoretically, a superuser can read the memory of the MariaDB server process to read the decrypted keys or restart MariaDB with password authentication disabled in order to dump data, or add new users to MariaDB in order to allow a user to connect and dump the data. Resolving these issues is beyond the scope of this document. A user who gains root access to your operating system or root access to your MariaDB server will have the ability to decrypt your data. Plan accordingly.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="managing-aws-credentials">Managing AWS credentials</h2> <p>Putting the AWS credentials in a file inside the MariaDB home directory is not ideal. By default, any user with the FILE privilege can read any files that the MariaDB server has permission to read, which would include the credentials file. To protect against this, you should set <code>secure_file_priv</code> to restrict the location the server will allow a user to read from when executing <code>LOAD DATA INFILE</code> or the <code>LOAD_FILE()</code> function.</p> <p>But putting them in other locations requires passing additional data to the server, which in the case of CentOS 7 requires customizing the systemd startup procedure. This is most easily done by creating a "drop-in" file in /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/. The file should end in ".conf" but can otherwise be named whatever you like. After making any changes to systemd files, execute <code>systemctl daemon-reload</code> and then start (or restart) the service as usual.</p> <p>You can place the credentials file in a location of your choosing and then refer to that file by setting the <code>AWS_CREDENTIAL_PROFILES_FILE</code> environment variable in the drop-in file:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">[Service]
Environment=AWS_CREDENTIAL_PROFILES_FILE=/etc/aws-kms-credentials
</pre>
<p>The credentials file will need to be readable by the "mysql" user, but it does not need to be readable by any other user.</p> <p>AWS credentials can also be put directly into a "drop-in" systemd file that will be read when starting the MariaDB service:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># cat /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/aws-kms.conf
[Service]
Environment=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIRSG2XYZATCJLZ4A
Environment=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ux91LZIxCp4ZXabcdefgIViQNtTan42QAmJqJVqV
</pre>
<p>However, any OS user can read this information from systemd, which could be considered a security risk. Another solution is to put the credentials in a separate file that is only readable by root and then refer to that file using an <code>EnvironmentFile</code> directive in a drop-in systemd file.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># cat /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/aws-kms.env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIRSG2XYZATCJLZ4A
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ux91LZIxCp4ZXabcdefgIViQNtTan42QAmJqJVqV

# chown root /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/aws-kms.env
# chmod 600 /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/aws-kms.env

# cat /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/aws-kms.conf
[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/aws-kms.env
</pre>
<p>That has the advantage the the credentials can only be read directly by root. systemd adds those variables to the environment of the MariaDB server when starting it, and MariaDB can use the credentials to interact with AWS. Note, though, that any process running as the "mysql" user can still read the credentials from the proc filesystem on Linux.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">$ whoami

<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="aws-kms-key-policy">AWS KMS Key Policy</h2> <p>AWS KMS allows flexible, user-editable key policy. This offers fine-grained control over which users can operate on keys. The possibilities range from simply restricting which IP addresses are allowed to perform operations on the key, to requiring a MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) device to use the key, to enforcing separation of responsibilities by creating an additional user with limited privileges to enable and disable the key. All 3 of these options will be outlined in this section.</p> <p>For more details about customizing the Key Policy for your master keys, please consult the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-overview">AWS Key Management Service Key Policy</a> documentation.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="source-ip-restrictions">Source IP restrictions</h3> <p>A simple, common-sense restriction to put in place is to restrict the range of IP addresses that are allowed to use your master key. This way, even if someone obtains API credentials, they'll be unable to use them to decrypt your encryptions keys from a different host.</p> <p>To restrict API access from only a specific IP address or range of IP addresses, you'll need to manually edit the key policy.</p> <ol start="1">
<li>Load the IAM console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/</a>. </li>
<li>Click "Encryption Keys" in the left-hand sidebar. </li>
<li>Click the name of your encryption key to view its details. </li>
<li>Click the link labeled "Switch to policy view", to the right of the heading of the "Key Policy" section. </li>
<li>Locate the section that contains <code>"Sid": "Allow use of the key"</code>. </li>
<li>Add this text below the <code>"Sid"</code> line:<pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">      "Condition": {

          ]
        }
      },
</pre> ... replacing <code>10.1.2.3/32</code> above with an IP address or range of IP addresses in CIDR format. For example, a single address would be <code>192.168.12.34/32</code>, while a range of addresses might be <code>192.168.0.0/24</code>. </li>
<li>Click "Save Changes". </li>
<li>Click "Proceed" if prompted with a warning about using the default view in the future. </li>
</ol> <p>Access to the API will now be restricted to requests coming from the IP address or range of IP addresses specified in the policy.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="using-a-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-device">Using a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device</h3> <p>One approach is to modify the key policy for the master key so that MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is required in order to use the key. This is achieved with a wrapper that handles prompting the user for an MFA token, acquires temporary, limited-privilege credentials from the AWS Security Token Service (STS), and puts those credentials into the environment of the MariaDB server process. The credentials can expire after as little as 15 minutes.</p> <p>To require an MFA token for users of the key, you'll need to manually edit the key policy.</p> <ol start="1">
<li>Load the IAM console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/</a>. </li>
<li>Click "Encryption Keys" in the left-hand sidebar. </li>
<li>Click the name of your encryption key to view its details. </li>

      },
</pre> </li>
<li>Click "Save Changes". </li>
<li>Click "Proceed" if prompted with a warning about using the default view in the future. </li>
</ol> <p>Now, add an MFA device for your user. You'll need to have a hardware MFA device or an application such as Google Authenticator installed on your smartphone.</p> <ol start="1">
<li>Click "Users" in the left-hand sidebar. </li>
<li>Click the name of your user. </li>
<li>Click the "Security Credentials" tab. </li>
<li>In the "Sign-In Credentials" section, click the "Manage MFA Device" button. </li>
<li>Complete the steps to activate your MFA device. </li>
<li>Copy the ARN for your MFA device. You will need to use this when configuring the wrapper program. </li>
</ol> <p>Now, set up the wrapper program.</p> <ol start="1">
<li>Copy the iam-kms-wrapper file to /usr/local/bin/, and ensure that it is executable. </li>
<li>Create a drop-in systemd config file in <code>/etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/</code>:<pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/aws-kms.env
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/iam-kms-wrapper --config=/etc/my.cnf.d/iam-kms-wrapper.config /usr/sbin/mysqld $MYSQLD_OPTS
</pre> </li>
<li>Execute <code>systemctl daemon-reload</code>. </li>
<li>Create a file at <code>/etc/my.cnf.d/iam-kms-wrapper.config</code> with these contents, using the ARN for your MFA device as the value for <code>kms_mfa_id</code>:<pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">[kms]
kms_mfa_id = arn:aws:iam::551888187628:mfa/MDBEnc
kms_mfa_socket = /tmp/kms_mfa_socket
</pre> </li>
</ol> <p>When you start the MariaDB service now, the wrapper will temporarily create a socket file at the location given by the <code>kms_mfa_socket</code> option. The wrapper will read the MFA code from the socket and will use it to authenticate to KMS. To give the MFA code, simply write the digits to the socket file using <code>echo</code>: <code>echo 111676 &gt; /tmp/kms_mfa_socket</code>.</p> <p>The <code>systemctl</code> command will block until MariaDB starts, so you will need to write the code to the socket file via a separate terminal.</p> <p>Note that the temporary credentials put into the environment of the MariaDB process will expire after a period of time defined by the request to the AWS Security Token Service (STS). In the example below, they will expire after 900 seconds. After that time, MariaDB may be unable to generate new encrypted data keys, which means that, for example, an attempt to create a table with a previously-unused key ID would fail.</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="wrapper-program-example">Wrapper program example</h4> <p>Here's an example wrapper program written in go. Build this into an executable named <code>iam-kms-wrapper</code> and use it as instructed above. This could of course be written in any language for which an appropriate AWS SDK exists, but go has the benefit of compiling to a static binary, which means you do not have to worry about interpreter versions or installing complex dependencies on the host that runs your MariaDB server.</p> <pre class="fixed wrap" data-language="sql">package main

<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="disabling-keys-when-not-needed">Disabling keys when not needed</h3> <p>Another possibility is to use the API to disable access to the master key and enable it only when a trusted administrator knows that the MariaDB service needs to be started. A specialized tool on a separate host could be used to enable the key for a very short period of time while the service starts and then quickly disable the key.</p> <p>To do this, you can create an extra IAM User that can only use the kms:EnableKey and kms:DisableKey API endpoints for your key.

</ol> <p>You've now added a new IAM user and you've given that user privileges to enable and disable your key.

</pre>
<p>In order for MariaDB to start, this new user will have to enable the master key, then the DBA can start MariaDB, and this user can once again disable the master key after the service has started. Note that in this workflow, MariaDB will be unable to create new encryption keys, such as would be done when a user creates a table that refers to a non-existent key ID. The AWS KMS plugin will encounter an error if it tries to generate a new encryption key while the master key is disabled. In that scenario, the key administrator would have to enable the key before the operation could succeed. Here's what you should expect to see in the journal if MariaDB tries to interact with a disabled master key:</p> <pre class="fixed wrap" data-language="sql">[ERROR] AWS KMS plugin : GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext failed : DisabledException - Unable to parse ExceptionName: DisabledException Message: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:551888181234:key/abcdf8f6-084b-4cff-99ca-abcdef6c7907c is disabled.

<h4 class="anchored_heading" id="adding-mfa">Adding MFA</h4> <p>It's also possible to add MFA to this technique so that the user that enables &amp; disables the master key has to authenticate using an MFA device.
