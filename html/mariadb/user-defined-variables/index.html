<h1>User-Defined Variables</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> User-defined variables are variables which can be created by the user and exist in the session. This means that no one can access user-defined variables that have been set by another user, and when the session is closed these variables expire. However, these variables can be shared between several queries and <a href="../stored-programs-and-views/index.html">stored programs</a>.</p> <p>User-defined variables names must be preceded by a single <em>at</em> character (<code>@</code>). While it is safe to use a reserved word as a user-variable name, the only allowed characters are ASCII letters, digits, dollar sign (<code>$</code>), underscore (<code>_</code>) and dot (<code>.</code>). If other characters are used, the name can be quoted in one of the following ways:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>@`var_name` </li>
<li>@'var_name' </li>
<li>@"var_name" </li>
</ul> <p>These characters can be escaped as usual.</p> <p>User-variables names are case insensitive, though they were case sensitive in MySQL 4.1 and older versions.</p> <p>User-defined variables cannot be declared. They can be read even if no value has been set yet; in that case, they are NULL. To set a value for a user-defined variable you can use:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<a href="../set/index.html">SET</a> statement; </li>
<li>
<a href="../assignment-operator/index.html">:=</a> operator within a SQL statement; </li>
<li>
<a href="../select-into/index.html">SELECT ... INTO</a>. </li>
</ul> <p>Since user-defined variables type cannot be declared, the only way to force their type is using <a href="../cast/index.html">CAST()</a> or <a href="../convert/index.html">CONVERT()</a>:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SET @str = CAST(123 AS CHAR(5));
</pre>
<p>If a variable has not been used yet, its value is NULL:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT @x IS NULL;
+------------+
| @x IS NULL |
+------------+
|          1 |
+------------+
</pre>
<p>It is unsafe to read a user-defined variable and set its value in the same statement (unless the command is SET), because the order of these actions is undefined.</p> <p>User-defined variables can be used in most MariaDB's statements and clauses which accept an SQL expression. However there are some exceptions, like the <a href="../select/index.html#limit">LIMIT</a> clause.</p> <p>They must be used to <a href="../prepare-statement/index.html">PREPARE</a> a prepared statement:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">@sql = 'DELETE FROM my_table WHERE c&gt;1;';
PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
EXECUTE stmt;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
</pre>
<p>Another common use is to include a counter in a query:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SET @var = 0;
SELECT a, b, c, (@var:=@var+1) AS counter FROM my_table;
</pre>
