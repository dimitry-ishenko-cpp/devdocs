<h1>Secure Connections Overview</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <p>By default, MariaDB transmits data between the server and clients without encrypting it. This is generally acceptable when the server and client run on the same host or in networks where security is guaranteed through other means. However, in cases where the server and client exist on separate networks or they are in a high-risk network, the lack of encryption does introduce security concerns as a malicious actor could potentially eavesdrop on the traffic as it is sent over the network between them.</p> <p>To mitigate this concern, MariaDB allows you to encrypt data in transit between the server and clients using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. TLS was formerly known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL), but strictly speaking the SSL protocol is a predecessor to TLS and, that version of the protocol is now considered insecure. The documentation still uses the term SSL often and for compatibility reasons TLS-related server system and status variables still use the prefix <code>ssl_</code>, but internally, MariaDB only supports its secure successors.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="checking-mariadb-server-for-tls-support">Checking MariaDB Server for TLS Support</h2> <p>In order for MariaDB Server to use TLS, it needs to be compiled with TLS support. All MariaDB packages distributed by MariaDB Foundation and MariaDB Corporation are compiled with TLS support.</p> <p>If you aren't sure whether your MariaDB Server binary was compiled with TLS support, then you can check the value of the <code><a href="../ssl-system-variables/index.html#have_ssl">have_ssl</a></code> system variable. For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'have_ssl';
+---------------+----------+
| Variable_name | Value    |
+---------------+----------+
| have_ssl      | DISABLED |
+---------------+----------+
</pre>
<p>The possible values are:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>If it is <code>DISABLED</code>, then the server was compiled with TLS support, but TLS is not enabled. </li>
<li>If it is <code>YES</code>, then the server was compiled with TLS support, and TLS is enabled. </li>
<li>If it is <code>NO</code>, then the server was not compiled with TLS support. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="tls-libraries">TLS Libraries</h2> <p>When MariaDB is compiled with TLS and cryptography support, it is usually either statically linked with MariaDB's bundled TLS and cryptography library, which might be <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl/">wolfSSL</a> or <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/products/yassl/">yaSSL</a>, or dynamically linked with the system's TLS and cryptography library, which might be <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>, <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/">GnuTLS</a>, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/secauthn/secure-channel">Schannel</a>.</p> <p>See <a href="../tls-and-cryptography-libraries-used-by-mariadb/index.html">TLS and Cryptography Libraries Used by MariaDB</a> for more information about which libraries are used on which platforms.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="tls-protocol-versions">TLS Protocol Versions</h2> <p>There are 4 versions of the TLS protocol:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<code>TLSv1.0</code> </li>
<li>
<code>TLSv1.1</code> </li>
<li>
<code>TLSv1.2</code> </li>
<li>
<code>TLSv1.3</code> </li>

<strong class="product_title">MariaDB starting with <a href="../what-is-mariadb-104/index.html">10.4</a></strong><p>The <code><a href="../ssltls-system-variables/index.html#tls_version">tls_version</a></code> system variable was first introduced in <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1046-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.4.6</a>.</p> </div>
<p>In some cases, it might make sense to only enable specific TLS protocol versions. For example, it would make sense if your organization has to comply with a specific security standard. It would also make sense if a vulnerability is found in a specific TLS protocol version, and you would like to ensure that your server does not use the vulnerable protocol version.</p> <div class="cstm-style greenbox">
<p>The <a href="https://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/resource-guide-migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls">PCI DSS v3.2</a> recommends using a minimum protocol version of TLSv1.2.</p> </div>
<p>On the <strong>server</strong> side, users can enable specific TLS protocol versions by setting the <code><a href="../ssltls-system-variables/index.html#tls_version">tls_version</a></code> system variable. This system variable accepts a comma-separated list of TLS protocol versions. A TLS protocol version will only be enabled if it is present in this list. All other TLS protocol versions will not be permitted. This system variable can be specified as a command-line argument to <a href="../mysqld-options/index.html">mysqld</a> or it can be specified in a relevant server <a href="../configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/index.html#option-groups">option group</a> in an <a href="../configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/index.html">option file</a>. For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">[mariadb]
...
tls_version = TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
</pre>
<p>You can check which TLS protocol versions are enabled on a server by executing <code><a href="../show-variables/index.html">SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES</a></code>. For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'tls_version';
</pre>
<p>On the <strong>client</strong> side, users can enable specific TLS protocol versions by setting the <code>--tls-version</code> option. This option accepts a comma-separated list of TLS protocol versions. A TLS protocol version will only be enabled if it is present in this list. All other TLS protocol versions will not be permitted. For example, to specify this option in a relevant client <a href="../configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/index.html#option-groups">option group</a> in an <a href="../configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/index.html">option file</a>, you could set the following:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">[client-mariadb]
...
tls_version = TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
</pre>
<p>Or if you wanted to specify it on the command-line with the <a href="../mariadb-command-line-client/index.html">mariadb</a> client, then you could execute something like this:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">$ mariadb -u myuser -p -h myserver.mydomain.com \
