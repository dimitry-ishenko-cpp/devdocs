<h1>Multi master replication and deadlock detection in Galera with Mariadbs</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="question formatted"> <p>Hi, </p> <p>We have multi master Galera replication setup where three master mariadbs are continuously updated. 1. Because of which occasionally a transaction encounters deadlock. 2. The JDBC queries slow down their executions if we allow continuous table updates. </p> <p>Add to the mix an event that purges the tables and we noticed a deletion of more than 200000 entries held the lock for more than 15 seconds. </p> <p>How can we rectify this problem? Is there a way to improve DB performance in replication setup? We also used non replicated setup and the portal does not encounter any JDBC connection errors. </p> <p>Your insights are much appreciated. </p> <p>Thanks</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
