This affected how we started merging XtraDB in.</p> <p>Now Percona maintains a normal source repository on launchpad (<code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">lp:percona-server</code>). But we continue to merge the old way to preserve the history of our changes.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="merging">Merging</h3> <p>There used to be a <code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">lp:percona-xtradb</code> tree, that we were merging from as:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">bzr merge lp:percona-xtradb
</pre>
<p>Now we have to maintain our own XtraDB-5.5 repository to merge from. It is <code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">lp:~maria-captains/maria/xtradb-mergetree-5.5</code>. Follow the procedures as described in <a href="../merging-with-a-merge-tree/index.html">Merging with a merge tree</a> to merge from it.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
