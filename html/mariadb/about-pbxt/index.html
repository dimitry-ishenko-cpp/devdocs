<h1>About PBXT</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> <a href="http://www.primebase.org">PBXT</a> was a storage engine that was included in the MariaDB source and binaries by default until <a href="../what-is-mariadb-53/index.html">MariaDB 5.3</a>.</p> <p>Since <a href="../what-is-mariadb-55/index.html">MariaDB 5.5</a>, the PBXT storage engine has been disabled by default and must be <a href="../how-to-build-pbxt/index.html">explicitly built</a> to use it. The reason is that PBXT is not actively maintained anymore. It has a few bugs that are not fixed and it's not actively used.</p> <p>The PBXT versions in various releases are:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>version 1.0.11 in <a href="http://askmonty.org/wiki/MariaDB:Download:MariaDB_5.1.47">MariaDB 5.1.47</a> </li>
<li>version 1.0.08d in <a href="http://askmonty.org/wiki/MariaDB:Download:MariaDB_5.1.44b">MariaDB 5.1.44b</a> </li>
</ul> <p>PBXT is a general purpose transactional storage engine. PBXT is fully "ACID" compliant, which means it can be used as an alternative to other MariaDB transactional engines (such as XtraDB or InnoDB).</p> <p>PBXT features include the following:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<strong>MVCC Support:</strong> MVCC stands for Multi-version Concurrency Control. MVCC allows reading the database without locking. </li>
<li>
<strong>Fully ACID compliant:</strong> This means that all transactions are: atomic, consistent, isolated and durable. </li>
<li>
<strong>Row-level locking:</strong> When updating, PBXT uses row-level locking. Row-level locking is also used during SELECT FOR UPDATE. </li>
<li>
<strong>Fast Rollback and Recovery:</strong> PBXT uses a specialized method to identify garbage which makes "undo" unnecessary. This make both rollback of transactions and recovery after restart very fast. </li>
<li>
<strong>Deadlock Detection:</strong> PBXT identifies all kinds of deadlocks immediately. </li>
<li>
<strong>Write-once:</strong> PBXT uses a log-based storage which makes it possible to write transactional data directly to the database, without first being writen to the transaction log. </li>
<li>
<strong>Referential Integrity:</strong> PBXT supports <a href="../foreign-keys/index.html">foreign key</a> definitions, including cascaded updates and deletes. </li>
<li>
<strong>BLOB streaming:</strong> In combination with the <a href="http://www.blobstreaming.org">BLOB Streaming engine</a> PBXT can stream binary and media directly in and out of the database. </li>
</ul> <p>PBXT will not take any resources (disk space or CPU processing) until you create your first PBXT table.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="xtstat">xtstat</h2> <p>The included <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">xtstat</code> program can be used to monitor all internal activity of PBXT. See <a href="../xtstat/index.html">xtstat</a> for more information.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="more-information">More information</h2> <p>Further documentation for PBXT can be found here: <a href="http://www.primebase.org/documentation">http://www.primebase.org/documentation</a></p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
