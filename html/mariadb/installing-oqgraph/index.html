<h1>Installing OQGRAPH</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> The Open Query GRAPH computation engine, or OQGRAPH as the engine itself is called, allows you to handle hierarchies (tree structures) and complex graphs (nodes having many connections in several directions).</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="installation">Installation</h2> <p>The OQGRAPH storage engine exists as a separate package in the repositories for <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1007-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.0.7</a> and later. On Ubuntu and Debian the package is called <code>mariadb-oqgraph-engine-10.0</code> or <code>mariadb-plugin-oqgraph</code>. On Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora the package is called <code>MariaDB-oqgraph-engine</code>. To install the plugin, first install the appropriate package and then install the plugin using the <a href="../install-soname/index.html">INSTALL SONAME</a> or <a href="../install-plugin/index.html">INSTALL PLUGIN</a> commands.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="debian-and-ubuntu">Debian and Ubuntu</h3> <p>On Debian and Ubuntu, install the package as follows:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sudo apt-get install mariadb-plugin-oqgraph
</pre>
<p>or (for <a href="../what-is-mariadb-100/index.html">MariaDB 10.0</a>)</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sudo apt-get install mariadb-oqgraph-engine-10.0 
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="fedorared-hatcentos">Fedora/Red Hat/CentOS</h3> <p>Note that OQGRAPH v3 requires libjudy, which is not in the official Red Hat/Fedora repositories. This needs to be installed first, for example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
</pre>
<p>Then install the package, as follows:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sudo yum install MariaDB-oqgraph-engine
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="installing-the-plugin">Installing the Plugin</h3> <p>On either system you can then launch the <code>mysql</code> command-line client and install the plugin in MariaDB as follows:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">INSTALL SONAME 'ha_oqgraph';
