<h1>Aria Encryption Overview</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <p>MariaDB can encrypt data in tables that use the <a href="../aria/index.html">Aria storage engine</a>. This includes both user-created tables and internal on-disk temporary tables that use the Aria storage engine. This ensures that your Aria data is only accessible through MariaDB.</p> <p>For encryption with the InnoDB and XtraDB storage engines, see <a href="../encrypting-data-for-innodb-xtradb/index.html">Encrypting Data for InnoDB/XtraDB</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="basic-configuration">Basic Configuration</h2> <p>In order to enable encryption for tables using the <a href="../aria/index.html">Aria storage engine</a>, there are a couple server system variables that you need to set and configure. Most users will want to set <code><a href="../aria-system-variables/index.html#aria_encrypt_tables">aria_encrypt_tables</a></code> and <code><a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#encrypt_tmp_disk_tables">encrypt_tmp_disk_tables</a></code>.</p> <p>Users of data-at-rest encryption will also need to have a <a href="../encryption-key-management/index.html">key management and encryption plugin</a> configured. Some examples are <a href="../file-key-management-encryption-plugin/index.html">File Key Management Plugin</a> and <a href="../aws-key-management-encryption-plugin/index.html">AWS Key Management Plugin</a>.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">[mariadb]

# File Key Management
plugin_load_add = file_key_management
file_key_management_filename = /etc/mysql/encryption/keyfile.enc
file_key_management_filekey = FILE:/etc/mysql/encryption/keyfile.key
file_key_management_encryption_algorithm = AES_CTR

<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="determining-whether-a-table-is-encrypted">Determining Whether a Table is Encrypted</h2> <p>The <a href="../xtradb-and-innodb/index.html">InnoDB storage engine</a> has the <a href="../information-schema-innodb_tablespaces_encryption-table/index.html">information_schema.INNODB_TABLESPACES_ENCRYPTION table</a> that can be used to get information about which tables are encrypted. Aria does not currently have anything like that (see <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-17324">MDEV-17324</a> about that).</p> <p>To determine whether an Aria table is encrypted, you currently have to search the data file for some plain text that you know is in the data.</p> <p>For example, let's say that we have the following table:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM db1.aria_tab LIMIT 1;
+----+------+
| id | str  |
+----+------+
|  1 | str1 |
+----+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec

</pre>
<p>Then, we could search the data file that belongs to <code>db1.aria_tab</code> for <code>str1</code> using a command-line tool, such as <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/strings">strings</a>:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">$ sudo strings /var/lib/mysql/db1/aria_tab.MAD | grep "str1"
str1
</pre>
<p>If you can find the plain text of the string, then you know that the table is not encrypted.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="encryption-and-the-aria-log">Encryption and the Aria Log</h2> <p>Only Aria tables are currently encrypted. The <a href="../aria-faq/index.html#differences-between-aria-and-myisam">Aria log</a> is not yet encrypted. See <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-8587">MDEV-8587</a> about that.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
