Lunch will be served, courtesy of Facebook.</p> <h1 class="anchored_heading" id="target-audience">Target Audience</h1> <p>Developers who are writing storage engines and plugins, knowing the plugin architecture of either MySQL, the extensions in MariaDB as well as the differences in Drizzle. User defined function (UDF) writers are welcome too.</p> <p>Its expanded from just an invited audience of MySQL storage engine vendors this year.</p> <p>Seats are limited to <strong>twenty-four (24)</strong> attendees.</p> <h1 class="anchored_heading" id="whos-attending">Who's Attending</h1> <p>If you're attending, <strong>this is the signup form!</strong> Please fill up your name, email address, company, and any other contact information you may have (like Facebook, Twitter).

</ol> <h1 class="anchored_heading" id="notes">Notes</h1> <h1 class="anchored_heading" id="linking-with-the-storage-engine-advisory-board-at-oracle">Linking with the Storage Engine Advisory Board at Oracle</h1> <p>Volker Odoba - member of the storage engine advisory board at Oracle</p> <ul start="1">
<li>an explanation from Oracle as to why/if/when Oracle will take patches to extend the storage engine layer from the community </li>
<li>its been mentioned that you might have to pay to be on the advisory board (i.e. you must be a customer) </li>
<li>next meeting is at Oracle OpenWorld in October </li>
<li>Schooner, Primebase, InnoDB, Infobright, Kickfire was there (now no longer since they do not exist) </li>
</ul> <h1 class="anchored_heading" id="topics">Topics</h1> <ul start="1">
<li>HBase storage engine layer to work with dynamic columns </li>
<li>Discovery (Shared metadata) </li>
<li>Materialised views </li>
<li>Online ALTER TABLE </li>
<li>Parallel replication (not SE, but a related topic) </li>
<li>Group commit </li>
<li>Parallel execution </li>
<li>Fulltext search for every storage engine </li>
<li>Cross-engine Online Backup </li>
<li>Finish off server definition interface for FederatedX. Make it generic enough so that Spider can also use it. </li>
<li>Pluggable data types </li>
<li>Indexing/Dynamic Functions </li>
<li>Fast load </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="hbase-by-chip-turner">HBase by Chip Turner</h2> <p>Distributed key value store. Single index on a given table. Distributed servers each serving a row, multiple rows. Lexicographically sorted. No C API, there's a proxy API and Chip is fixing that now. Current protocol is serialized Java. Eventually each HBase server will speak Thrift. See <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/ThriftApi">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/ThriftApi</a> and <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/">http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/</a></p> <p>Index Condition Pushdown and MRR are useful here.</p> <p>Messages is a HBase application.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="index-condition-pushdown">Index Condition Pushdown</h2> <ul start="1">
<li>idx_cond_push() </li>
<li>opt_index_condition_pushdown.cc </li>
<li>EXPLAIN will say Using index condition </li>
<li>Don't copy HA_NDBCLUSTER::COND_PUSH() since it is not done in a seinsble way. Much smarter implementations are possible with easy code - psergey </li>
<li>This will be continued in discussion via email (sphinx, infobright, tokutek, spider, oqgraph) <ul start="1"><li>TODO: Timour will create a Worklog entry and involve appropriate attendees </li></ul> </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="discovery">Discovery</h2> <p>Cluster with many MySQL servers connected to it. It was originally designed for MySQL Cluster. </p> <ul start="1"><li>TODO: Serg to write an explanation here. Session led by him. </li></ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="loadable-indexes">Loadable Indexes</h2> <ul start="1">
<li>TODO: Paul, Kentoku, Richard, and Serg to discuss further </li>
<li>Fulltext search </li>
<li>Dynamic indexing method to existing storage engines are required. Do you want to store the data and index in the engine? It is not necessary (Kentoku). Want to implement just an index, not a storage engine. Storage format might be completely different. </li>
<li>Practical use of having indexes for all engines? GIS. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="parallel-execution">Parallel Execution</h2> <ul start="1"><li>Read in two threads, will that be a problem for the storage engine? Two handlers within the same transaction ID calling in. Could just be a switch for the storage engine. Same THD in two different threads. </li></ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="online-backup">Online Backup</h2> <ul start="1">
<li>Status hasn't changed since last year after Oracle cancelled it. No work has been done on this. </li>
<li>Needs about 6 months sponsorship of one person's salary to get such a feature enabled </li>
<li>Mark doesn't like running hot backup in the server and thinks its not generally a good idea. He prefers using xtrabackup, a separate process from the server. xtrabackup is a transactional log reader (Domas has joined us and is now enlightening everyone on xtrabackup features). <ul start="1"><li>Replication team and this meeting are the only folk that ask for this </li></ul> </li>
<li>MyISAM has implemented backups twice now, and it has never made it outside </li>
<li>Focus on what will gain you traction. Look on Percona Server. It just focuses on what customers want. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="pluggableabstract-data-types">Pluggable/abstract data types</h2> <ul start="1"><li>UUID, IPv4/IPv6 address, complex numbers, etc. </li></ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="online-alter">Online ALTER</h2> <ul start="1">
<li>Zardosht has an example from MySQL Cluster. He likes the implementation in MySQL Cluster 7.1. They have a different alter table API, and they've ported this to TokuDB with support for MySQL 5.1 and <a href="../what-is-mariadb-51/index.html">MariaDB 5.1</a>/5.2. </li>
<li>Wait and see the work that Oracle is doing? </li>
<li>Old 6.0.3 - online alter and metadata alter - serg checked </li>
<li>Zardosht's patch will work with <a href="../what-is-mariadb-53/index.html">MariaDB 5.3</a>, but once there's <a href="../what-is-mariadb-55/index.html">MariaDB 5.5</a> based on MySQL 5.5 he's terribly worried about porting </li>
