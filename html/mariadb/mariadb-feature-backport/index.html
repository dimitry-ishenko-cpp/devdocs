<li>BKA itself was used by a customer with a proprietary engine, and also by NDB, so can be assumed tested. </li>

<p><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=4614">MySQL Worklog #4614</a> and <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=4690">MySQL Worklog #4690</a> are considered droppable.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="plan-for-action-committed">Plan for action (committed)</h2> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="general-considerations">General considerations</h3> <p>It seems to be infeasible to take mysql-6.0 and fix it until it has release quality. We'll have to do it other way around: start from mariadb-5.2 codebase and pull features to there, one by one. This process will be called "backport".</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="backport-mrrbka-sergeyp">Backport MRR/BKA (SergeyP)</h3> <p>MRR/BKA has been there for longer time than other features and so is more stable and so is a natural candidate for the first step.</p> <p>Needed actions:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Backport MRR/BKA code <ul start="1">
<li>According to Igor, code at SQL layer should be easy to move </li>
<li>Code inside MyISAM and Maria should be easily movable </li>
<li>TODO what to do about MRR/NDB? We need to get it to compile at least. </li>
<li>The trickest engine is InnoDB/XtraDB <ul start="1"><li>will need to take changes that we've made to InnoDB and apply them to XtraDB (TODO will Percona accept that? Or we'll have to maintain patches-to-patches?) </li></ul> </li>
</ul> </li>
<li>We'll also need to fix the known MRR/InnoDB bugs </li>
</ul> <p>After MRR has been pushed, it received a number of code cleanups, bugfixes, and interface adjustments (motivated by BKA and NDB/Falcon implementations). This means that there is no single MRR patch, instead one should go through revisions and cherry-pick MRR-related patches (one of the ways to narrow down the number of revisions: most (all?) MRR fixes were made by sergefp@mysql.com,</p> <p>with exception of this fix:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"> 2726 Guilhem Bichot    2009-03-13
      Fix for multiple symptoms sharing the same cause:
      BUG#42297 Maria: crash in multi-range-read code
      BUG#42298 Maria: SELECT with join returns no rows
      ...
</pre>
<p>In addition to backport, we need the following adjustments:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Let DS-MRR support clustered primary keys (needed when using BKA). </li>
<li>
<del>Remove conditions used for key access from the condition pushed to index (We sometimes get "Using index condition" where there was no "Using where")</del> Considered done as we're unable to find any examples for this. </li>
<li>
<del>Introduce a separate @@optimizer_switch flag for turning on/out ICP.</del> DONE. </li>
<li>Rename multi_range_read_info_const() to look like it is not a part of MRR interface </li>
</ul> <p>All of the above is filed as <a href="http://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=67">MWL#67</a>: <a href="http://askmonty.org/worklog/Server-Sprint/index.pl?tid=67">http://askmonty.org/worklog/Server-Sprint/index.pl?tid=67</a></p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="milestone-bka-1-bka-backported">Milestone BKA-1: BKA backported</h4> <p>After the above is done, BKA will work in <a href="../what-is-mariadb-52/index.html">MariaDB 5.2</a> codebase in the same way as it worked in MySQL 6.0, but without MRR/InnoDB bugs.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="subquery-optimization-efficient-not-in-execution-with-null-timour">Subquery optimization: Efficient NOT IN execution with NULL (Timour)</h3> <p>Implement <a href="http://askmonty.org/worklog/Server-Sprint/index.pl?tid=68">http://askmonty.org/worklog/Server-Sprint/index.pl?tid=68</a></p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="plan-for-action-planned">Plan for action (planned)</h2> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="step-take-bka-into-account-in-join-optimizer-sergeyp-or-igor">Step: Take BKA into account in join optimizer (SergeyP or Igor)</h3> <p>Implement this item</p> <ul start="1"><li>[No WL]: Make the join optimizer account for BKA. </li></ul> <p>According to Igor:</p> <p>Within this milestone, assume a certain join_cache_level setting (it is likely the estimates will be so rough that it won't matter)</p> <p>TODO: clarify if this includes making the choice between doing MRR scan and then filesorting vs doing non-MRR scan but not having to sort.</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="milestone-bka-2-bka-with-cost-based-optimization">Milestone BKA-2: BKA with cost-based optimization</h4> <p>After the above is done, we'll have MRR/BKA with cost-based optimization.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="step-subqueries-start-backport-and-bugfixing">Step: Subqueries, start: backport and bugfixing</h3> <p>This step includes backporting all pushed 6.0's subquery optimizations and fixing open wrong-result or crash bugs, including addressing of these problems:</p> <ul start="1"><li>Semi-join optimizations, including semi-join materialization has issues: <ul start="1">
<li>The "outer join and semi-join problem" </li>
<li>The different-datatypes-comparison problem </li>
</ul> </li></ul> <p>At the moment it seems the preferred course of action is to first fix the bugs and then backport.</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="milestone-subq-get-on-track">Milestone SUBQ-GET-ON-TRACK</h4> <p>After the above is done, we'll be able to assume that we "got on track" with subquery development and will be able to proceed further in many directions.</p> <p>NOTE: it is not fully known what we'll discover when this milestone is reacheed. Perhaps, we'll discover that subquery cost model needs some adjustments (but there's always a way out, penalize all non-5.1 plans so that the 5.1 plan wins in near competitions and thus there are no regressions).</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="step-from-subqueries">Step: FROM subqueries</h3> <p>After the semi-join subqueries are done, the biggest and most annoying gap in subquery optimizations will be poor FROM subquery handling. Thus, the next item is to take the available code for</p> <ul start="1"><li>
<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=3485">MySQL Worklog #3485</a>: Subquery optimization: FROM (SELECT) </li></ul> <p>and finish that.</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="milestone-subq-from-subqueries">Milestone SUBQ-FROM-SUBQUERIES</h4> <ul start="1"><li>This milestone adds <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=3485">MySQL Worklog #3485</a>. </li></ul> <p>(is there really sense to have a linear plan that extends further than this? Let's reach this point and release?)</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="step-more-subqueries-1">Step: More subqueries 1</h3> <p>This is a step that has high ROI, can be done more-or-less indepdendently of the other work, and doesn't require in-depth knowlege of new subquery code/features:</p> <ul start="1"><li>
<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=1117">MySQL Worklog #1117</a>: Subquery optimization: Avoid recalculating subquery if external fields have not changed </li></ul> <p>this can be passed over to somebody who haven't worked with subquery code before.</p> <p>(note: this task has a natural extension: create and use a cache of external_field_values-&gt;subquery_result mappings.</p> <p>Btw, certain nose-trunk databases do not seem to handle this case.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="step-more-subqueries-2">Step: More subqueries 2</h3> <p>Another separate, high-ROI item:</p> <ul start="1"><li>
