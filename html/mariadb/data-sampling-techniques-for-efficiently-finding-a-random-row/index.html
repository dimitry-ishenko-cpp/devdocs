<h1>Data Sampling: Techniques for Efficiently Finding a Random Row</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="fetching-random-rows-from-a-table-beyond-order-by-rand">Fetching random rows from a table (beyond ORDER BY RAND())</h2> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="the-problem">The problem</h3> <p>One would like to do "SELECT ... ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 10" to get 10 rows at random. But this is slow. The optimizer does</p> <ul>
<li>Fetch all the rows -- this is costly </li>
<li>Append <a href="../rand/index.html">RAND()</a> to the rows </li>
<li>Sort the rows -- also costly </li>
<li>Pick the first 10. </li>
</ul> <p>All the algorithms given below are "fast", but most introduce flaws:</p> <ul>
<li>Bias -- some rows are more like to be fetched than others. </li>
<li>Repetitions -- If two random sets contain the same row, they are likely to contain other dups. </li>
<li>Sometimes failing to fetch the desired number of rows. </li>
</ul> <p>"Fast" means avoiding reading all the rows. There are many techniques that require a full table scan, or at least an index scan. They are not acceptable for this list. There is even a technique that averages half a scan; it is relegated to a footnote.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="metrics">Metrics</h3> <p>Here's a way to measure performance without having a big table.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">    FLUSH STATUS;
    SELECT ...;
    SHOW SESSION STATUS LIKE 'Handler%';
</pre>
<p>If some of the "Handler" numbers look like the number of rows in the table, then there was a table scan.</p> <p>None of the queries presented here need a full table (or index) scan. Each has a time proportional to the number of rows returned.</p> <p>Virtually all published algorithms involve a table scan. The previously published version of this blog had, embarrassingly, several algorithms that had table scans.</p> <p>Sometimes the scan can be avoided via a subquery. For example, the first of these will do a table scan; the second will not.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT *  FROM RandTest AS a
  WHERE id = FLOOR(@min + (@max - @min + 1) * RAND());  -- BAD: table scan
SELECT *
 FROM RandTest AS a
 JOIN (
   SELECT FLOOR(@min + (@max - @min + 1) * RAND()) AS id -- Good; single eval.
      ) b  USING (id);

<li>Requirement: <a href="../auto_increment/index.html">AUTO_INCREMENT</a> id </li>
<li>Requirement: No gaps in id </li>
</ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">  SELECT r.*
      FROM (
          SELECT FLOOR(mm.min_id + (mm.max_id - mm.min_id + 1) * RAND()) AS id

<p>(Of course, you might be able to simplify this. For example, min_id is likely to be 1. Or precalculate limits into @min and @max.)</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="case-consecutive-auto_increment-without-gaps-10-rows">Case: Consecutive AUTO_INCREMENT without gaps, 10 rows</h3> <ul>
<li>Requirement: AUTO_INCREMENT id </li>

</pre>
<p>The FLOOR expression could lead to duplicates, hence the inflated inner LIMIT. There could (rarely) be so many duplicates that the inflated LIMIT leads to fewer than the desired 10 different rows. One approach to that Flaw is to rerun the query if it delivers too few rows.</p> <p>A variant:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">  SELECT r.*

<li>Requirement: AUTO_INCREMENT, possibly with gaps due to DELETEs, etc </li>
