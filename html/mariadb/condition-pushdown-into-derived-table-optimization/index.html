<h1>Condition Pushdown into Derived Table Optimization</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> If a query uses a derived table (or a view), the first action that the query optimizer will attempt is to apply the <a href="../derived-table-merge-optimization/index.html">derived-table-merge-optimization</a> and merge the derived table into its parent select. However, that optimization is only applicable when the select inside the derived table has a join as the top-level operation. If it has a <a href="../group-by/index.html">GROUP-BY</a>, <a href="../select/index.html#distinct">DISTINCT</a>, or uses <a href="../window-functions/index.html">window functions</a>, then <a href="../derived-table-merge-optimization/index.html">derived-table-merge-optimization</a> is not applicable. </p> <p>In that case, the Condition Pushdown optimization is applicable.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="introduction-to-condition-pushdown">Introduction to Condition Pushdown</h2> <p>Consider an example</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">create view OCT_TOTALS as
select
  customer_id,
  SUM(amount) as TOTAL_AMT
from orders
where  order_date BETWEEN '2017-10-01' and '2017-10-31'
group by customer_id;

select * from OCT_TOTALS where customer_id=1
</pre>
<p>The naive way to execute the above is to</p> <ol start="1">
<li>Compute the OCT_TOTALS contents (for all customers). </li>
<li>The, select the line with customer_id=1 </li>
</ol> <p>This is obviously inefficient, if there are 1000 customers, then one will be doing up to 1000 times more work than necessary.</p> <p>However, the optimizer can take the condition <code>customer_id=1</code> and push it down into the OCT_TOTALS view.</p> <p>(TODO: elaborate here)</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="condition-pushdown-properties">Condition Pushdown Properties</h2> <ul start="1">
