<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Checking master version</td>
<td>Checking the master's version, which only occurs very briefly after establishing a connection with the master.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Connecting to master</td>
<td>Attempting to connect to master.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Queueing master event to the relay log</td>
<td>Event is being copied to the <a href="../relay-log/index.html">relay log</a> after being read, where it can be processed by the SQL thread.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Reconnecting after a failed binlog dump request</td>
<td>Attempting to reconnect to the master after a previously failed binary log dump request.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Reconnecting after a failed master event read</td>
<td>Attempting to reconnect to the master after a previously failed request. After successfully connecting, the state will change to <code>Waiting for master to send event</code>.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Registering slave on master</td>
<td>Registering the slave on the master, which only occurs very briefly after establishing a connection with the master.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Requesting binlog dump</td>
<td>Requesting the contents of the binary logs from the given log file name and position. Only occurs very briefly after establishing a connection with the master.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Waiting for master to send event</td>
<td>Waiting for <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a> events to arrive after successfully connecting. If there are no new events on the master, this state can persist for as many seconds as specified by the <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/index.html#slave_net_timeout">slave_net_timeout</a> system variable, after which the thread will reconnect.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Waiting for slave mutex on exit</td>
<td>Waiting for slave mutex while the thread is stopping. Only occurs very briefly.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Waiting for the slave SQL thread to free enough relay log space.</td>

<a href="../relay-log/index.html">Relay log</a> has reached its maximum size, determined by <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/index.html#relay_log_space_limit">relay_log_space_limit</a> (no limit by default), so waiting for the SQL thread to free up space by processing enough relay log events.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Waiting for master update</td>
<td>State before connecting to master.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>Waiting to reconnect after a failed binlog dump request</td>
<td>Waiting to reconnect after a binary log dump request has failed due to disconnection. The length of time in this state is determined by the <code>MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY</code> clause of the <a href="../change-master-to/index.html">CHANGE MASTER TO</a> statement.</td>
</tr> <tr>

<td>Sleeping while waiting to reconnect after a disconnection error. The time in seconds is determined by the <code>MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY</code> clause of the <a href="../change-master-to/index.html">CHANGE MASTER TO</a> statement.</td>
