<h1>Choosing the Right Storage Engine</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> A high-level overview of the main reasons for choosing a particular storage engine:</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="topic-list">Topic List</h2> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="general-purpose">General Purpose</h3> <ul>
<li>
<a href="../innodb/index.html">InnoDB</a> is a good general transaction storage engine, and, from <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index.html">MariaDB 10.2</a>, the best choice in most cases. It is the default storage engine from <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index.html">MariaDB 10.2</a>. For earlier releases, XtraDB was a performance enhanced fork of InnoDB and is usually preferred. </li>
<li>
<a href="../aria/index.html">Aria</a>, MariaDB's more modern improvement on <a href="../myisam/index.html">MyISAM</a>, has a small footprint and allows for easy copying between systems. </li>

<a href="../myisam/index.html">MyISAM</a> has a small footprint and allows for easy copying between systems. MyISAM is MySQL's oldest storage engine. There is usually little reason to use it except for legacy purposes. Aria is MariaDB's more modern improvement. </li>
<li>
<a href="../xtradb/index.html">XtraDB</a> was the best choice in <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">MariaDB 10.1</a> and earlier in the majority of cases. It was a performance-enhanced fork of InnoDB and was MariaDB's default engine until <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">MariaDB 10.1</a>. </li>
</ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="scaling-partitioning">Scaling, Partitioning</h3> <p>When you want to split your database load on several servers or optimize for scaling. We also suggest looking at <a href="../galera/index.html">Galera</a>, a synchronous multi-master cluster.</p> <ul>
<li>
<a href="../spider/index.html">Spider</a> uses partitioning to provide data sharding through multiple servers. </li>
<li>
<a href="../columnstore/index.html">ColumnStore</a> utilizes a massively parallel distributed data architecture and is designed for big data scaling to process petabytes of data. </li>
<li>The <a href="../merge/index.html">MERGE</a> storage engine is a collection of identical <a href="../myisam/index.html">MyISAM</a> tables that can be used as one. "Identical" means that all tables have identical column and index information. </li>
<li>
<a href="../tokudb/index.html">TokuDB</a> is a transactional storage engine which is optimized for workloads that do not fit in memory, and provides a good compression ratio. TokuDB has been deprecated by its upstream developers, and is disabled in <a href="../what-is-mariadb-105/index.html">MariaDB 10.5</a>, and removed in <a href="../what-is-mariadb-106/index.html">MariaDB 10.6</a> </li>
</ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="compression-archive">Compression / Archive</h3> <ul>
<li>
<a href="../myrocks/index.html">MyRocks</a> enables greater compression than InnoDB, as well as less write amplification giving better endurance of flash storage and improving overall throughput. </li>
<li>The <a href="../archive/index.html">Archive</a> storage engine is, unsurprisingly, best used for archiving. </li>

<li>
<a href="../connect/index.html">CONNECT</a> allows access to different kinds of text files and remote resources as if they were regular MariaDB tables. </li>
<li>The <a href="../csv/index.html">CSV</a> storage engine can read and append to files stored in CSV (comma-separated-values) format. However, since <a href="../what-is-mariadb-100/index.html">MariaDB 10.0</a>, CONNECT is a better choice and is more flexibly able to read and write such files. </li>
<li>
<a href="../federatedx/index.html">FederatedX</a> uses libmysql to talk to the data source, the data source being a remote RDBMS. Currently, since FederatedX only uses libmysql, it can only talk to another MySQL RDBMS. </li>
