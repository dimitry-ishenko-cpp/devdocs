<h1>MariaDB 5.5.33 Debian and Ubuntu Installation Issues</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Shortly after the <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-5533-release-notes/">MariaDB 5.5.33</a> release we became aware of some installation issues with the Debian and Ubuntu repositories. These issues were fixed in <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-5533a-release-notes/">MariaDB 5.5.33a</a>, but due to how apt works, steps need to be taken to solve the broken dependencies before upgrading.</p> <p>We know of three scenarios when dependencies were broken. The steps to fix each of them are pretty much the same, only the list of broken dependencies and hence the list of packages to take care of them differs. The basic idea is to downgrade those certain packages to 5.5.32 temporarily before upgrading them to 5.5.33a.</p> <p>If you ran into issues when moving from <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-5532-release-notes/">MariaDB 5.5.32</a> to <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-5533-release-notes/">MariaDB 5.5.33</a>, look through each of the three scenarios to see which one applies to you and then follow the steps to apply that fix.</p>  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="applying-the-fix">Applying the fix</h2> <p>To get your system ready to apply the fix, do the following:</p> <ul start="1"><li>Comment out the standard <a href="../what-is-mariadb-55/index.html">MariaDB 5.5</a> repo in the <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> or <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mariadb.repo</code> file (or wherever you have the repositories configured). </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Add a <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-5532-release-notes/">MariaDB 5.5.32</a> repository to the <code>sources.list</code>. The easiest way is to add the following. Just replace '<code>{os}</code>' and '<code>{dist}</code>' with the appropriate values. </li></ul> <pre class="fixed indent1" data-language="sql">deb http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/mariadb/mariadb-5.5.32/repo/{os} {dist} main
</pre>
<div style="margin-left:2em">
<div style="margin-left:2em">
<p>For example, on Debian Wheezy the line would be:</p> </div> </div> <pre class="fixed indent2" data-language="sql">deb http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/mariadb/mariadb-5.5.32/repo/debian wheezy main
</pre>
<div style="margin-left:2em">
<div style="margin-left:2em">
<p>And on Ubuntu Raring the line would be:</p> </div> </div> <pre class="fixed indent2" data-language="sql">deb http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/mariadb/mariadb-5.5.32/repo/ubuntu raring main
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>Then run '<code>sudo apt-get update</code>' </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Then '<code>sudo apt-get install</code>' the list of packages to downgrade as given in the applicable section below. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Next, modify our sources.list to remove the 5.5.32 repo and switch back to the normal 5.5 repo </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Then '<code>sudo apt-get update</code>' to get things back to normal </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>As a final optional step, once your normal mirror has at least <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-5533a-release-notes/">MariaDB 5.5.33a</a> you can '<code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code>' to upgrade. To check what version of MariaDB our mirror has, run the following command (after running '<code>sudo apt-get update</code>'): </li></ul> <pre class="fixed indent1" data-language="sql">apt-cache show mariadb-server | grep Version
