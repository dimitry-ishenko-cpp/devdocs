<h1>Sequence Storage Engine</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <div class="cstm-style greenbox">
<p>This article is about the Sequence storage engine. For details about sequence objects, see <a href="../sequences/index.html">Sequences</a>.</p> </div>
<p>A <strong>Sequence</strong> engine allows the creation of ascending or descending sequences of numbers (positive integers) with a given starting value, ending value and increment.</p> <p>It creates completely virtual, ephemeral tables automatically when you need them. There is no way to create a Sequence table explicitly. Nor are they ever written to disk or create <code>.frm</code> files. They are read-only, <a href="../transactions/index.html">transactional</a>, and <a href="../xa-transactions/index.html">support XA</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="installing">Installing</h2> <p>The Sequence engine is installed by default, and <a href="../show-engines/index.html">SHOW ENGINES</a> will list the Sequence storage engine as supported:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW ENGINES\G

<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="usage-and-examples">Usage and Examples</h2> <p>To use a Sequence table, you simply select from it, as in</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM seq_1_to_5;
+-----+
| seq |
+-----+
|   1 |
|   2 |
|   3 |
|   4 |
|   5 |
+-----+
</pre>
<p>To use a sequence in a statement, you select from the table named by a pattern <strong>seq_</strong><code>FROM</code><strong>_to_</strong><code>TO</code> or <strong>seq_</strong><code>FROM</code><strong>_to_</strong><code>TO</code><strong>_step_</strong><code>STEP</code>.</p> <p>In the case of an odd step, the sequence will commence with the <code>FROM</code>, and end at the final result before <code>TO</code>.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM seq_1_to_15_step_3;
+-----+
| seq |
+-----+
|   1 |
|   4 |
|   7 |
|  10 |
|  13 |
+-----+
</pre>
<p>A sequence can go backwards too. In this case the final value will always be the <code>TO</code> value, so that a descending sequence has the same values as an ascending sequence:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM seq_5_to_1_step_2;
+-----+
| seq |
+-----+
|   5 |
|   3 |
|   1 |
+-----+
</pre>
<pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM seq_15_to_1_step_3;
+-----+
| seq |
+-----+
|  13 |
|  10 |
|   7 |
|   4 |
|   1 |
+-----+
</pre>
<pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM seq_15_to_2_step_3;
+-----+
| seq |
+-----+
|  14 |
|  11 |
|   8 |
|   5 |
|   2 |
+-----+
</pre>
<p>This engine is particularly useful with joins and subqueries. For example, this query finds all prime numbers below 50:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT seq FROM seq_2_to_50 s1 WHERE 0 NOT IN
     (SELECT s1.seq % s2.seq FROM seq_2_to_50 s2 WHERE s2.seq &lt;= sqrt(s1.seq));
+-----+
| seq |
+-----+
|   2 |
|   3 |
|   5 |
|   7 |
|  11 |
|  13 |
|  17 |
|  19 |
|  23 |
|  29 |
|  31 |
|  37 |
|  41 |
|  43 |
|  47 |
+-----+
</pre>
<p>And almost (without 2, the only even prime number) the same result with joins:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT s1.seq FROM seq_2_to_50 s1 JOIN seq_2_to_50 s2 
  WHERE s1.seq &gt; s2.seq AND s1.seq % s2.seq &lt;&gt; 0 
  GROUP BY s1.seq HAVING s1.seq - COUNT(*) = 2;
+-----+
| seq |
+-----+
|   3 |
|   5 |
|   7 |
|  11 |
|  13 |
|  17 |
|  19 |
|  23 |
|  29 |
|  31 |
|  37 |
|  41 |
|  43 |
|  47 |
+-----+
</pre>
<p>Sequence tables can also be useful in date calculations. For example, to find the day of the week that a particular date has fallen on over a 40 year period (perhaps for birthday planning ahead!):</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT DAYNAME('1980-12-05' + INTERVAL (seq) YEAR) day,
    '1980-12-05' + INTERVAL (seq) YEAR date FROM seq_0_to_40;
+-----------+------------+
| day       | date       |
+-----------+------------+
| Friday    | 1980-12-05 |
| Saturday  | 1981-12-05 |
| Sunday    | 1982-12-05 |
...
| Friday    | 2014-12-05 |
| Saturday  | 2015-12-05 |
| Monday    | 2016-12-05 |
| Tuesday   | 2017-12-05 |
| Wednesday | 2018-12-05 |
| Thursday  | 2019-12-05 |
| Saturday  | 2020-12-05 |
+-----------+------------+

<p>Although Sequence tables can only directly make use of positive integers, they can indirectly be used to return negative results by making use of the <a href="../cast/index.html">CAST</a> statement. For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT CAST(seq AS INT) - 5 x FROM seq_5_to_1;
+----+
| x  |
+----+
|  0 |
| -1 |
| -2 |
| -3 |
| -4 |
+----+
</pre>
<p><a href="../cast/index.html">CAST</a> is required to avoid a <code>BIGINT UNSIGNED value is out of range</code> error.</p> <p>Sequence tables, while virtual, are still tables, so they must be in a database. This means that a default database must be selected (for example, via the <a href="../use/index.html">USE</a> command) to be able to query a Sequence table. The <a href="../information-schema/index.html">information_schema</a> database cannot be used as the default for a Sequence table.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="table-name-conflicts">Table Name Conflicts</h2> <p>If the SEQUENCE storage engine is installed, it is not possible to create a table with a name which follows the SEQUENCE pattern:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE seq_1_to_100 (col INT) ENGINE = InnoDB;
ERROR 1050 (42S01): Table 'seq_1_to_100' already exists
</pre>
<p>However, a SEQUENCE table can be converted to another engine and the new table can be referred in any statement:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">ALTER TABLE seq_1_to_100 ENGINE = BLACKHOLE;

SELECT * FROM seq_1_to_100;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>While a SEQUENCE table cannot be dropped, it is possible to drop the converted table. The SEQUENCE table with the same name will still exist:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">DROP TABLE seq_1_to_100;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM seq_1_to_100;
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|      100 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>A temporary table with a SEQUENCE-like name can always be created and used:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE seq_1_to_100 (col INT) ENGINE = InnoDB;

SELECT * FROM seq_1_to_100;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
