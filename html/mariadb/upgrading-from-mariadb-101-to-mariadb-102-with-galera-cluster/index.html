<h1>Upgrading from MariaDB 10.1 to MariaDB 10.2 with Galera Cluster</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <div class="mariadb_from_10_1 mariadb from_10_1 product">
<strong class="product_title">MariaDB starting with <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">10.1</a></strong><p>Since <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">MariaDB 10.1</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep">MySQL-wsrep</a> patch has been merged into MariaDB Server. Therefore, in <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">MariaDB 10.1</a> and above, the functionality of MariaDB Galera Cluster can be obtained by installing the standard MariaDB Server packages and the Galera wsrep provider library package.</p> </div> <p>Beginning in <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">MariaDB 10.1</a>, <a href="../what-is-mariadb-galera-cluster/index.html">Galera Cluster</a> ships with the MariaDB Server. Upgrading a Galera Cluster node is very similar to upgrading a server from <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">MariaDB 10.1</a> to <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index.html">MariaDB 10.2</a>. For more information on that process as well as incompatibilities between versions, see the <a href="../upgrading-from-mariadb-101-to-mariadb-102/index.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="performing-a-rolling-upgrade">Performing a Rolling Upgrade</h2> <p>The following steps can be used to perform a rolling upgrade from <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">MariaDB 10.1</a> to <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index.html">MariaDB 10.2</a> when using Galera Cluster. In a rolling upgrade, each node is upgraded individually, so the cluster is always operational. There is no downtime from the application's perspective.</p> <p>First, before you get started:</p> <ol start="1">
<li>First, take a look at <a href="../upgrading-from-mariadb-101-to-mariadb-102/index.html">Upgrading from MariaDB 10.1 to MariaDB 10.2</a> to see what has changed between the major versions. <ol start="1">
<li>Check whether any system variables or options have been changed or removed. Make sure that your server's configuration is compatible with the new MariaDB version before upgrading. </li>
<li>Check whether replication has changed in the new MariaDB version in any way that could cause issues while the cluster contains upgraded and non-upgraded nodes. </li>
<li>Check whether any new features have been added to the new MariaDB version. If a new feature in the new MariaDB version cannot be replicated to the old MariaDB version, then do not use that feature until all cluster nodes have been upgrades to the new MariaDB version. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li>Next, make sure that the Galera version numbers are compatible. <ol start="1">
<li>If you are upgrading from the most recent <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">MariaDB 10.1</a> release to <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index.html">MariaDB 10.2</a>, then the versions will be compatible. Both <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">MariaDB 10.1</a> and <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index.html">MariaDB 10.2</a> use Galera 3 (i.e. Galera wsrep provider versions 25.3.x), so they should be compatible. </li>
<li>See <a href="../what-is-mariadb-galera-cluster/index.html#galera-wsrep-provider-versions">What is MariaDB Galera Cluster?: Galera wsrep provider Versions</a> for information on which MariaDB releases uses which Galera wsrep provider versions. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li>Ideally, you want to have a large enough gcache to avoid a <a href="../introduction-to-state-snapshot-transfers-ssts/index.html">State Snapshot Transfer (SST)</a> during the rolling upgrade. The gcache size can be configured by setting <code><a href="../wsrep_provider_options/index.html#gcachesize">gcache.size</a></code> For example: <br> <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">wsrep_provider_options="gcache.size=2G"</code> </li>
</ol> <div class="cstm-style bluebox">
<p>Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database. This is always a good idea to do before an upgrade. We would recommend <a href="../mariabackup/index.html">Mariabackup</a>.</p> </div> <p>Then, for each node, perform the following steps:</p> <ol start="1">
<li>Modify the repository configuration, so the system's package manager installs <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index.html">MariaDB 10.2</a>. For example, <ul start="1">
<li>On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see <a href="../installing-mariadb-deb-files/index.html#updating-the-mariadb-apt-repository-to-a-new-major-release">Updating the MariaDB APT repository to a New Major Release</a> for more information. </li>
<li>On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see <a href="../yum/index.html#updating-the-mariadb-yum-repository-to-a-new-major-release">Updating the MariaDB YUM repository to a New Major Release</a> for more information. </li>
<li>On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see <a href="../installing-mariadb-with-zypper/index.html#updating-the-mariadb-zypp-repository-to-a-new-major-release">Updating the MariaDB ZYpp repository to a New Major Release</a> for more information. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li>If you use a load balancing proxy such as MaxScale or HAProxy, make sure to drain the server from the pool so it does not receive any new connections. </li>
<li>Set <code><a href="../xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/index.html#innodb_fast_shutdown">innodb_fast_shutdown</a></code> to <code>0</code>. It can be changed dynamically with <code><a href="../set/index.html#global-session">SET GLOBAL</a></code>. For example: <br> <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown=0;</code> <ul start="1"><li>This step is not necessary when upgrading to <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1025-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.2.5</a> or later. Omitting it can make the upgrade process far faster. See <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-12289">MDEV-12289</a> for more information. </li></ul> </li>
<li>
<a href="../starting-and-stopping-mariadb-starting-and-stopping-mariadb/index.html">Stop MariaDB</a>. </li>
<li>Uninstall the old version of MariaDB and the Galera wsrep provider. <ul start="1">
<li>On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following: <br> <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">sudo apt-get remove mariadb-server galera</code> </li>
<li>On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following: <br> <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">sudo yum remove MariaDB-server galera</code> </li>
<li>On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following: <br> <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">sudo zypper remove MariaDB-server galera</code> </li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Install the new version of MariaDB and the Galera wsrep provider. <ul start="1">
<li>On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see <a href="../installing-mariadb-deb-files/index.html#installing-mariadb-packages-with-apt">Installing MariaDB Packages with APT</a> for more information. </li>
<li>On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see <a href="../yum/index.html#installing-mariadb-packages-with-yum">Installing MariaDB Packages with YUM</a> for more information. </li>
<li>On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see <a href="../installing-mariadb-with-zypper/index.html#installing-mariadb-packages-with-zypp">Installing MariaDB Packages with ZYpp</a> for more information. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Make any desired changes to configuration options in <a href="../configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/index.html">option files</a>, such as <code>my.cnf</code>. This includes removing any system variables or options that are no longer supported. <ul start="1"><li>In order to use Galera Cluster without problems in <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index.html">MariaDB 10.2</a>, the <code><a href="../xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/index.html#innodb_lock_schedule_algorithm">innodb_lock_schedule_algorithm</a></code> system variable must be set to <code>FCFS</code>. In <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10212-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.2.12</a> and later, this system variable is automatically set to this value when Galera Cluster is enabled. In <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10211-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.2.11</a> and before, this system variable must be set to this value manually. See <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-12837">MDEV-12837</a> for more information. </li></ul> </li>
<li>On Linux distributions that use <code>systemd</code> you may need to increase the service startup timeout as the default timeout of 90 seconds may not be sufficient. See <a href="../systemd/index.html#configuring-the-systemd-service-timeout">Systemd: Configuring the Systemd Service Timeout</a> for more information. </li>
<li>
<a href="../starting-and-stopping-mariadb-starting-and-stopping-mariadb/index.html">Start MariaDB</a>. </li>
<li>Run <code><a href="../mysql_upgrade/index.html">mysql_upgrade</a></code> with the <code>--skip-write-binlog</code> option. <ul start="1"><li>
<code>mysql_upgrade</code> does two things: <ol start="1">
<li>Ensures that the system tables in the <code><a href="../the-mysql-database-tables/index.html">mysq</a>l</code> database are fully compatible with the new version. </li>
<li>Does a very quick check of all tables and marks them as compatible with the new version of MariaDB . </li>
</ol> </li></ul> </li>
</ol> <p>When this process is done for one node, move onto the next node.</p> <div class="cstm-style bluebox">
<p>Note that when upgrading the Galera wsrep provider, sometimes the Galera protocol version can change. The Galera wsrep provider should not start using the new protocol version until all cluster nodes have been upgraded to the new version, so this is not generally an issue during a rolling upgrade. However, this can cause issues if you restart a non-upgraded node in a cluster where the rest of the nodes have been upgraded.</p> </div>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="additional-details">Additional details</h3> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="checking-status-of-the-state-transfer">Checking Status of the State Transfer</h4> <p>When a node rejoins the cluster after being upgraded, it may have to perform a state transfer, such as an <a href="../getting-started-with-mariadb-galera-cluster/index.html#incremental-state-transfers-ists">Incremental State Transfer (IST)</a> or a <a href="../introduction-to-state-snapshot-transfers-ssts/index.html">State Snapshot Transfer(SST)</a>. It is recommended to ensure that the node's state transfer is complete before upgrading the next node in the cluster.</p> <h5 class="anchored_heading" id="state-transfers-that-provide-access-to-the-server">State Transfers that Provide Access to the Server</h5> <p>If the node is synchronizing with the cluster by performing a state transfer that allows access to the server, such as an <a href="../getting-started-with-mariadb-galera-cluster/index.html#incremental-state-transfers-ists">Incremental State Transfer (IST)</a> or a <a href="../introduction-to-state-snapshot-transfers-ssts/index.html">State Snapshot Transfer(SST)</a> that uses the <code><a href="../mysqldump/index.html">mysqldump</a></code> SST method, then you can check the status of the state transfer by connecting to the server through the <code>mysql</code> client, then checking the <code><a href="../galera-cluster-status-variables/index.html#wsrep_local_state_uuid">wsrep_local_state_uuid</a></code> and <code><a href="../galera-cluster-status-variables/index.html#wsrep_cluster_state_uuid">wsrep_cluster_state_uuid</a></code> status variables. When they equal each other, the node is in sync with the cluster.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">select if((SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE AS "uuid"
FROM information_schema.GLOBAL_STATUS
WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = "wsrep_cluster_state_uuid")=(SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE AS "uuid"
FROM information_schema.GLOBAL_STATUS
WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = "wsrep_local_state_uuid"), "Synced", "Not Synced") as "Cluster Status"; 

+----------------+
| Cluster Status |
+----------------+
| Synced         |
+----------------+
</pre>
<p>When the local and cluster UUID's come into sync, the node is again online and functioning as a part of the cluster.</p> <h5 class="anchored_heading" id="state-transfers-that-require-the-server-to-be-down">State Transfers that Require the Server to be Down</h5> <p>Some state transfers require the server to be unavailable, such as all <a href="../introduction-to-state-snapshot-transfers-ssts/index.html">State Snapshot Transfer(SST)</a> methods other than <code>mysqldump</code>, so <code>mysql</code> client access is unavailable while the state transfer is happening. In those cases, you may have to monitor the progress of the state transfer in the <a href="../error-log/index.html">error log</a>. You'll know when the SST is complete when the joiner node changes its state to <code>SYNCED</code>. For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">2018-08-30 14:44:15 140694729484032 [Note] WSREP: Shifting JOINED -&gt; SYNCED (TO: 210248566)
