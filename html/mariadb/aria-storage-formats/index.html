<h1>Aria Storage Formats</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> The <a href="../aria/index.html">Aria</a> storage engine supports three different table storage formats.</p> <p>These are FIXED, DYNAMIC and PAGE, and they can be set with the ROW FORMAT option in the <a href="../create-table/index.html">CREATE TABLE</a> statement. PAGE is the default format, while FIXED and DYNAMIC are essentially the same as the <a href="../myisam-storage-formats/index.html">MyISAM formats</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="../show-table-status/index.html">SHOW TABLE STATUS</a> statement can be used to see the storage format used by a table.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="fixed-length">Fixed-length</h2> <p>Fixed-length (or static) tables contain records of a fixed-length. Each column is the same length for all records, regardless of the actual contents. It is the default format if a table has no BLOB, TEXT, VARCHAR or VARBINARY fields, and no ROW FORMAT is provided. You can also specify a fixed table with ROW_FORMAT=FIXED in the table definition.</p> <div class="cstm-style graybox">
<p>Tables containing BLOB or TEXT fields cannot be FIXED, as by design these are both dynamic fields.</p> </div>
<p>Fixed-length tables have a number of characteristics</p> <ul>
<li>fast, since MariaDB will always know where a record begins </li>
<li>easy to cache </li>
<li>take up more space than dynamic tables, as the maximum amount of storage space will be allocated to each record. </li>
<li>reconstructing after a crash is uncomplicated due to the fixed positions </li>
<li>no fragmentation or need to re-organize, unless records have been deleted and you want to free the space up. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="dynamic">Dynamic</h2> <p>Dynamic tables contain records of a variable length. It is the default format if a table has any BLOB, TEXT, VARCHAR or VARBINARY fields, and no ROW FORMAT is provided. You can also specify a DYNAMIC table with ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC in the table definition.</p> <p>Dynamic tables have a number of characteristics</p> <ul>
<li>Each row contains a header indicating the length of the row. </li>
<li>Rows tend to become fragmented easily. UPDATING a record to be longer will likely ensure it is stored in different places on the disk. </li>
<li>All string columns with a length of four or more are dynamic. </li>
<li>They require much less space than fixed-length tables. </li>
<li>Restoring after a crash is more complicated than with FIXED tables. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="page">Page</h2> <p>Page format is the default format for Aria tables, and is the only format that can be used if TRANSACTIONAL=1.</p> <p>Page tables have a number of characteristics:</p> <ul>
<li>It's cached by the page cache, which gives better random performance as it uses fewer system calls. </li>
<li>Does not fragment as easily easily as the DYNAMIC format during UPDATES. The maximum number of fragments are very low. </li>
<li>Updates more quickly than dynamic tables. </li>
<li>Has a slight storage overhead, mainly notable on very small rows </li>
<li>Slower to perform a full table scan </li>
<li>Slower if there are multiple duplicated keys, as Aria will first write a row, then keys, and only then check for duplicates </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="transactional">Transactional</h2> <p>See <a href="../aria-storage-engine/index.html">Aria Storage Engine</a> for the impact of the TRANSACTIONAL option on the row format.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
