<h1>Creating User-Defined Functions</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <p><a href="../user-defined-functions/index.html">User-defined functions</a> allow MariaDB to be extended with a new function that works like a native (built-in) MariaDB function such as <a href="../abs/index.html">ABS()</a> or <a href="../concat/index.html">CONCAT()</a>. There are alternative ways to add a new function: writing a native function (which requires modifying and compiling the server source code), or writing a stored function.</p> <p>Statements making use of user-defined functions are not safe for replication.</p> <p>Functions are written in C or C++, and to make use of them, the operating system must support dynamic loading. </p> <p>Each new SQL function requires corresponding functions written in C/C++. In the list below, at least the main function - x() - and one other, are required. <em>x</em> should be replaced by the name of the function you are creating.</p> <p>All functions need to be thread-safe, so not global or static variables that change can be allocated. Memory is allocated in <em>x_init()/ and freed in </em>x_deinit()<em>. </em></p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="simple-functions">Simple Functions</h2> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="x">x()</h3> <p>Required for all UDFs; this is where the results are calculated.</p>  <table>

<li>Check the number of arguments to X() (the SQL equivalent). </li>
<li>Verify the argument types, or to force arguments to be of a particular type after the function is called. </li>
<li>Specify whether the result can be NULL. </li>
<li>Specify the maximum result length. </li>
<li>For REAL functions, specify the maximum number of decimals for the result. </li>
<li>Allocate any required memory. </li>
</ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="x_deinit">x_deinit()</h3> <p>De-initialization function for x(). Used to de-allocate memory that was allocated in x_init().</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h3> <p>Each time the SQL function <em>X()</em> is called:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>MariaDB will first call the C/C++ initialization function, <em>x_init()</em>, assuming it exists. All setup will be performed, and if it returns an error, the SQL statement is aborted and no further functions are called. </li>
<li>If there is no <em>x_init()</em> function, or it has been called and did not return an error, <em>x()</em> is then called once per row. </li>
<li>After all rows have finished processing, <em>x_deinit()</em> is called, if present, to clean up by de-allocating any memory that was allocated in <em>x_init()</em>. </li>
