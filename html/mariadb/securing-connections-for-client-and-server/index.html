<h1>Securing Connections for Client and Server</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <p>By default, MariaDB transmits data between the server and clients without encrypting it. This is generally acceptable when the server and client run on the same host or in networks where security is guaranteed through other means. However, in cases where the server and client exist on separate networks or they are in a high-risk network, the lack of encryption does introduce security concerns as a malicious actor could potentially eavesdrop on the traffic as it is sent over the network between them.</p> <p>To mitigate this concern, MariaDB allows you to encrypt data in transit between the server and clients using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. TLS was formerly known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL), but strictly speaking the SSL protocol is a predecessor to TLS and, that version of the protocol is now considered insecure. The documentation still uses the term SSL often and for compatibility reasons TLS-related server system and status variables still use the prefix <code>ssl_</code>, but internally, MariaDB only supports its secure successors.</p> <p>In order to secure connections between the server and client, you need to ensure that your server was compiled with TLS support. See <a href="../secure-connections-overview/index.html">Secure Connections Overview</a> to determine how to check whether a server was compiled with TLS support.</p> <p>You also need an X509 certificate, a private key, and the Certificate Authority (CA) chain to verify the X509 certificate for the server. If you want to use two-way TLS, then you will also need an X509 certificate, a private key, and the Certificate Authority (CA) chain to verify the X509 certificate for the client. If you want to use self-signed certificates that are created with OpenSSL, then see <a href="../certificate-creation-with-openssl/index.html">Certificate Creation with OpenSSL</a> for information on how to create those. </p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="enabling-tls">Enabling TLS</h2> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="enabling-tls-for-mariadb-server">Enabling TLS for MariaDB Server</h3> <p>In order to enable TLS on a MariaDB server that was compiled with TLS support, there are a number of system variables that you need to set, such as:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>You need to set the path to the server's X509 certificate by setting the <a href="../ssltls-system-variables/index.html#ssl_cert">ssl_cert</a> system variable. </li>
<li>You need to set the path to the server's private key by setting the <a href="../ssltls-system-variables/index.html#ssl_key">ssl_key</a> system variable. </li>
<li>You need to set the path to the certificate authority (CA) chain that can verify the server's certificate by setting either the <a href="../ssltls-system-variables/index.html#ssl_ca">ssl_ca</a> or the <a href="../ssltls-system-variables/index.html#ssl_capath">ssl_capath</a> system variables. </li>
<li>If you want to restrict the server to certain ciphers, then you also need to set the <a href="../ssltls-system-variables/index.html#ssl_cipher">ssl_cipher</a> system variable. </li>
</ul> <p>For example, to set these variables for the server, add the system variables to a relevant server <a href="../configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/index.html#option-groups">option group</a> in an <a href="../configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/index.html">option file</a>:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">[mariadb]
...
ssl_cert = /etc/my.cnf.d/certificates/server-cert.pem
ssl_key = /etc/my.cnf.d/certificates/server-key.pem
ssl_ca = /etc/my.cnf.d/certificates/ca.pem
</pre>
<p>And then <a href="../starting-and-stopping-mariadb-starting-and-stopping-mariadb/index.html">restart the server</a> to make the changes persistent.</p> <p>Once the server is back up, you can check that TLS is enabled by checking the value of the <a href="../ssltls-system-variables/index.html#have_ssl">have_ssl</a> system variable. For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_ssl';

| have_ssl      | YES   |

<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="requiring-tls">Requiring TLS</h2> <p>From <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1052-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.5.2</a>, the <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#require_secure_transport">require_secure_transport</a> system variable is available. When set (by default it is off), connections attempted using insecure transport will be rejected. Secure transports are SSL/TLS, Unix sockets or named pipes. Note that requirements set for specific user accounts will take precedence over this setting.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="requiring-tls-for-specific-user-accounts">Requiring TLS for Specific User Accounts</h3> <p>You can set certain TLS-related restrictions for specific user accounts. For instance, you might use this with user accounts that require access to sensitive data while sending it across networks that you do not control. These restrictions can be enabled for a user account with the <a href="../create-user/index.html">CREATE USER</a>, <a href="../alter-user/index.html">ALTER USER</a>, or <a href="../grant/index.html">GRANT</a> statements. For example:</p> <ul start="1"><li>A user account must connect via TLS if the user account is defined with the <code>REQUIRE SSL</code> clause. </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">ALTER USER 'alice'@'%' 
   REQUIRE SSL;

<ul start="1"><li>A user account must connect via TLS with a specific cipher if the user account is defined with the <code>REQUIRE CIPHER</code> clause. </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">ALTER USER 'alice'@'%' 
   REQUIRE CIPHER 'ECDH-RSA-AES256-SHA384';
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>A user account must connect via TLS with a valid client certificate if the user account is defined with the <code>REQUIRE X509</code> clause. </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">ALTER USER 'alice'@'%' 
   REQUIRE X509;
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>A user account must connect via TLS with a specific client certificate if the user account is defined with the <code>REQUIRE SUBJECT</code> clause. </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">ALTER USER 'alice'@'%' 
   REQUIRE SUBJECT '/CN=alice/O=My Dom, Inc./C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Portland';
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>A user account must connect via TLS with a client certificate that must be signed by a specific certificate authority if the user account is defined with the <code>REQUIRE ISSUER</code> clause. </li></ul> <pre class="fixed wrap" data-language="sql">ALTER USER 'alice'@'%' 
   REQUIRE SUBJECT '/CN=alice/O=My Dom, Inc./C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Portland'
   AND ISSUER '/C=FI/ST=Somewhere/L=City/ O=Some Company/CN=Peter Parker/emailAddress=p.parker@marvel.com';
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="requiring-tls-for-specific-user-accounts-from-specific-hosts">Requiring TLS for Specific User Accounts from Specific Hosts</h3> <p>A user account can have different definitions depending on what host the user account is logging in from. Therefore, it is possible to have different TLS requirements for the same username for different hosts. For example:</p> <pre class="fixed wrap" data-language="sql">CREATE USER 'alice'@'localhost' 
   REQUIRE NONE;

CREATE USER 'alice'@'%'
   REQUIRE SUBJECT '/CN=alice/O=My Dom, Inc./C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Portland'
   AND ISSUER '/C=FI/ST=Somewhere/L=City/ O=Some Company/CN=Peter Parker/emailAddress=p.parker@marvel.com'
   AND CIPHER 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384';
</pre>
<p>In the above example, the <code>alice</code> user account does not require TLS when logging in from localhost. However, when the <code>alice</code> user account logs in from any other host, they must use TLS with the given cipher, and they must provide a valid client certificate with the given subject that must have been signed by the given issuer.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
