<h1>Scalar Subqueries</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>A scalar subquery is a <a href="../subqueries/index.html">subquery</a> that returns a single value. This is the simplest form of a subquery, and can be used in most places a literal or single column value is valid.</p> <p>The data type, length and <a href="../data-types-character-sets-and-collations/index.html">character set and collation</a> are all taken from the result returned by the subquery. The result of a subquery can always be NULL, that is, no result returned. Even if the original value is defined as NOT NULL, this is disregarded.</p> <p>A subquery cannot be used where only a literal is expected, for example <a href="../load-data-infile/index.html">LOAD DATA INFILE</a> expects a literal string containing the file name, and LIMIT requires a literal integer.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="examples">Examples</h2> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE sq1 (num TINYINT);

CREATE TABLE sq2 (num TINYINT);

INSERT INTO sq1 VALUES (1);

INSERT INTO sq2 VALUES (10* (SELECT num FROM sq1));

SELECT * FROM sq2;
+------+
| num  |
+------+
|   10 |
+------+
</pre>
<p>Inserting a second row means the subquery is no longer a scalar, and this particular query is not valid:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">INSERT INTO sq1 VALUES (2);

INSERT INTO sq2 VALUES (10* (SELECT num FROM sq1));
ERROR 1242 (21000): Subquery returns more than 1 row
</pre>
<p>No rows in the subquery, so the scalar is NULL:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">INSERT INTO sq2 VALUES (10* (SELECT num FROM sq3 WHERE num='3'));

SELECT * FROM sq2;
+------+
| num  |
+------+
|   10 |
| NULL |
+------+
</pre>
<p>A more traditional scalar subquery, as part of a WHERE clause:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM sq1 WHERE num = (SELECT MAX(num)/10 FROM sq2); 
+------+
| num  |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
