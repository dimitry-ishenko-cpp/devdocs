<h1>MyISAM Index Storage Space</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Regular <a href="../myisam/index.html">MyISAM</a> tables make use of <a href="../storage-engine-index-types/index.html#b-tree-indexes">B-tree indexes</a>.</p> <p>String indexes are space-compressed, which reduces the size of <a href="../varchar/index.html">VARCHARs</a> that don't use the full length, or a string that has trailing spaces. String indexes also make use of prefix-compression, where strings with identical prefixes are compressed.</p> <p>Numeric indexes can also be prefix-compressed compressed if the <a href="../create-table/index.html#table-options">PACK_KEYS=1</a> option is used. Regardless, the high byte is always stored first, which allows a reduced index size.</p> <p>In the worst case, with no strings being space-compressed, the total index storage space will be (index_length+4)/0.67 per index.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
