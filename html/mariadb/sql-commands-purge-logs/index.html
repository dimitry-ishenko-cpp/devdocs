<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h2> <p>The <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">PURGE BINARY LOGS</code> statement deletes all the <a href="../binary-log/index.html">binary log</a> files listed in the log index file prior to the specified log file name or date. <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">BINARY</code> and <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">MASTER</code> are synonyms. Deleted log files also are removed from the list recorded in the index file, so that the given log file becomes the first in the list.</p> <p>The datetime expression is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'. </p> <div class="cstm-style graybox">
<p>If a replica is active but has yet to read from a binary log file you attempt to delete, the statement will fail with an error. However, if the replica is not connected and has yet to read from a log file you delete, the file will be deleted, but the replica will be unable to continue replicating once it connects again.</p> </div>
<p>This statement has no effect if the server was not started with the <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#log_bin">--log-bin</a> option to enable binary logging.</p> <p>To list the binary log files on the server, use <a href="../show-binary-logs/index.html">SHOW BINARY LOGS</a>. To see which files they are reading, use <a href="../show-slave-status/index.html">SHOW SLAVE STATUS</a> (or <a href="../show-replica-status/index.html">SHOW REPLICA STATUS</a> from <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1051-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.5.1</a>). You can only delete the files that are older than the oldest file that is used by the slaves.</p> <p>To delete all binary log files, use <a href="../reset-master/index.html">RESET MASTER</a>. To move to a new log file (for example if you want to remove the current log file), use <a href="../flush/index.html">FLUSH LOGS</a> before you execute <code>PURGE LOGS</code>.</p> <p>If the <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#expire_logs_days">expire_logs_days</a> server system variable is not set to 0, the server automatically deletes binary log files after the given number of days. From <a href="../what-is-mariadb-106/index.html">MariaDB 10.6</a>, the <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index.html#binlog_expire_logs_seconds">binlog_expire_logs_seconds</a> variable allows more precise control over binlog deletion, and takes precedence if both are non-zero.</p> <p>Requires the <a href="super.html">SUPER</a> privilege or, from <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1052-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.5.2</a>, the <a href="../grant/index.html#binlog-admin">BINLOG ADMIN</a> privilege, to run.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="examples">Examples</h2> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'mariadb-bin.000063';
