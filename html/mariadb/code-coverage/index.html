<h1>Code Coverage</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>We are working on getting more of the MariaDB source covered by our mysql-test-run (MTR) test suite. This is an ongoing (and slow) task as there is still a lot of old code with not very good coverage.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="goals-for-new-code">Goals for new code</h2> <p>For new code in MariaDB, we aim much higher:</p> <p>The goals are:</p> <ol start="1">
<li>All new lines of code should ideally be tested by MTR. </li>
<li>Code which cannot reasonably be tested by MTR needs to be tested by another tool and those code lines marked with /* purecov: tested */. <ul start="1"><li>In this case the tool used for testing should be documented in the <a href="../worklog/index.html">worklog</a> entry for the code or in the commit message. </li></ul> </li>
<li>Code that can't reasonably be tested (such as error conditions) should be marked with '/* purecov: inspected */' so that a reviewer of the code can easily spot this code. </li>
<li>Code that is suspected to be deadcode should have a 'DBUG_ASSERT(0)' or be marked with '/* purecov: deadcode */' so that we have a chance to notice if the code is ever executed. </li>
</ol> <p>The reason we are using 'purecov' to mark lines is an attribution to the <a href="ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/rational/docs/v2002/dev_tools/purecov/html/ht_intro_pc.htm.html">purecov</a> tool we originally used for code coverage in the early years of MySQL.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="markers">Markers</h2> <p>The recommended markers are:</p> <p><code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><span class="cm">/* purecov: tested */</span>
</code></p> <ul start="1" style="list-style: none"><li>For code lines that are tested by something <em>other</em> than mysql-test-run: </li></ul> <p><code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><span class="cm">/* purecov: inspected */</span>
</code></p> <ul start="1" style="list-style: none"><li>For code lines that are hard to test but for which one has read the line multiple times to ensure it is correct. A code reviewer should also inspect these lines with care as they have not been properly tested. </li></ul> <p><code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><span class="cm">/* purecov: deadcode */</span>
</code></p> <ul start="1" style="list-style: none"><li>For code lines that one suspects will never be called. Having this marker allows us to generate a warning during mysql-test-run code coverage if this line is executed. </li></ul> <p>The comment must be placed on the line/lines that are affected.</p> <p>For code blocks larger than 1 line one can use the block syntax:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">/* purecov: begin tested */
....
/* purecov: end */
</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="running-mysql-test-run-with-gcov">Running mysql-test-run with gcov</h2> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3> <ol start="1">
<li>First make sure that gcov 4.9 is installed.Older versions of the gocv library (lgcov) can't handle running several instances of a program in parallel. This causes the generated .gov files to not contain all executed lines when running mysql-test-run with the --parallel option or running test that starts several mysqld servers, like replication or spider tests. </li>
<li>Compile MariaDB with BUILD/compile-pentium64-gcov (if your machine does not have a pentium CPU, hack this script, or just live with the pentium-specific stuff) </li>
</ol> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="running-mysql-test-run">Running mysql-test-run</h3> <p>To be able to see the level of coverage within the current test suite, do the following:</p> <ol start="1">
<li>In the mysql-test directory, run this command: <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">./mysql-test-run -gcov
</code> </li>
<li>To see which lines are not yet covered, look at <code>source_file_name.gcov</code> in the source tree. In <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index.html">MariaDB 10.1</a> or below it's in the CMakeFiles directory where the object files are stored. In <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index.html">MariaDB 10.2</a> it's stored together with the source files. </li>
<li>Think hard about a test case which will cover those lines that are not tested, and write one. </li>
</ol> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="tools">Tools</h2> <ul start="1">
<li>You can use the <a href="code-coverage-with-dgcov/dgcov_tool.html">code-coverage-with-dgcov/dgcov tool</a> to check the coverage for the new code. This is especially written and maintained for MariaDB. </li>
<li>For code coverage you also use the <a href="http://fedora13.selfip.org/lcov/">lcov</a> tool. </li>
