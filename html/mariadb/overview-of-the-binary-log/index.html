<h1>Overview of the Binary Log</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The binary log contains a record of all changes to the databases, both data and structure, as well as how long each statement took to execute. It consists of a set of binary log files and an index.</p> <p>This means that statements such as <a href="../create/index.html">CREATE</a>, <a href="../alter/index.html">ALTER</a>, <a href="../insert/index.html">INSERT</a>, <a href="../update/index.html">UPDATE</a> and <a href="../delete/index.html">DELETE</a> will be logged, but statements that have no effect on the data, such as SELECT and SHOW, will not be logged. If you want to log these (at a cost in performance), use the <a href="../general-query-log/index.html">general query log</a>.</p> <p>If a statement may potentially have an effect, but doesn't, such as an UPDATE or DELETE that returns no rows, it will still be logged (this applies to the default statement-based logging, not to row-based logging - see <a href="../binary-log-formats/index.html">Binary Log Formats</a>).</p> <p>The purpose of the binary log is to allow <a href="../replication/index.html">replication</a>, where data is sent from one or more masters to one or more slave servers based on the contents of the binary log, as well as assisting in backup operations.</p> <p>A MariaDB server with the binary log enabled will run slightly more slowly.</p> <p>It is important to protect the binary log, as it may contain sensitive information, including passwords.</p> <p>Binary logs are stored in a binary, not plain text, format, and so are not viewable with a regular editor. However, MariaDB includes <a href="../mariadb-binlog/index.html">mariadb-binlog</a>, a commandline tool for plain text processing of binary logs.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
