<h1>Troubleshooting Connection Issues</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> <br><br><br> If you are completely new to MariaDB and relational databases, you may want to start with the <a href="../a-mariadb-primer/index.html">MariaDB Primer</a>. Also, make sure you understand the connection parameters discussed in the <a href="../connecting-to-mariadb/index.html">Connecting to MariaDB</a> article. <br><br><br> There are a number of common problems that can occur when connecting to MariaDB. <br><br><br></p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="server-not-running-in-specified-location">Server Not Running in Specified Location</h3> <p>If the error you get is something like:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">mariadb -uname -p -uname -p
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through 
  socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2 "No such file or directory")
</pre>
<p>or</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">mariadb -uname -p --port=3307 --protocol=tcp
ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on  'localhost' 
  (111 "Connection refused")
</pre>
<p>the server is either not running, or not running on the specified port, socket or pipe. Make sure you are using the correct <a href="../connecting-to-mariadb/index.html#host">host</a>, <a href="../connecting-to-mariadb/index.html#port">port</a>, <a href="../connecting-to-mariadb/index.html#pipe">pipe</a>, <a href="../connecting-to-mariadb/index.html#socket">socket</a> and <a href="../connecting-to-mariadb/index.html#protocol">protocol</a> options, or alternatively, see <a href="../getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/index.html">Getting, Installing and Upgrading MariaDB</a>, <a href="../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/index.html">Starting and Stopping MariaDB</a> or <a href="../troubleshooting-installation-issues/index.html">Troubleshooting Installation Issues</a>.</p> <p>The socket file can be in a non-standard path. In this case, the <code>socket</code> option is probably written in the my.cnf file. Check that its value is identical in the [mysqld] and [client] sections; if not, the client will look for a socket in a wrong place.</p> <p>If unsure where the Unix socket file is running, it's possible to find this out, for example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">netstat -ln | grep mysqld
unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     33209505 /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="unable-to-connect-from-a-remote-location">Unable to Connect from a Remote Location</h3> <p>Usually, the MariaDB server does not by default accept connections from a remote client or connecting with tcp and a hostname and has to be configured to permit these.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">(/my/maria-10.4) ./client/mysql --host=myhost --protocol=tcp --port=3306 test
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'myhost' (115)

<p>To solve this, see <a href="../configuring-mariadb-for-remote-client-access/index.html">Configuring MariaDB for Remote Client Access</a></p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="authentication-problems">Authentication Problems</h3> <p>Note that from <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1043-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.4.3</a>, the <a href="../authentication-plugin-unix-socket/index.html">unix_socket authentication plugin</a> is enabled by default on Unix-like systems. This uses operating system credentials when connecting to MariaDB via the local Unix socket file. See <a href="../authentication-plugin-unix-socket/index.html">unix_socket authentication plugin</a> for instructions on connecting and on switching to password-based authentication as well as <a href="../authentication-from-mariadb-104/index.html">Authentication from MariaDB 10.4</a> for an overview of the <a href="../what-is-mariadb-104/index.html">MariaDB 10.4</a> changes..</p> <p>Authentication is granted to a particular username/host combination. <code>user1'@'localhost'</code>, for example, is not the same as <code>user1'@'166.78.144.191'</code>. See the <a href="../grant/index.html">GRANT</a> article for details on granting permissions.</p> <p>Passwords are hashed with <a href="../password/index.html">PASSWORD</a> function. If you have set a password with the <a href="../set-password/index.html">SET PASSWORD</a> statement, the <a href="../password/index.html">PASSWORD</a> function must be used at the same time. For example, <code>SET PASSWORD FOR 'bob'@'%.loc.gov' = PASSWORD('newpass')</code> rather than just <code>SET PASSWORD FOR 'bob'@'%.loc.gov' = 'newpass'</code>;</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="problems-exporting-query-results">Problems Exporting Query Results</h4> <p>If you can run regular queries, but get an authentication error when running the <a href="../select-into-outfile/index.html">SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</a>, <a href="../select-into-dumpfile/index.html">SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE</a> or <a href="../load-data-infile/index.html">LOAD DATA INFILE</a> statements, you do not have permission to write files to the server. This requires the FILE privilege. See the <a href="../grant/index.html">GRANT</a> article.</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="access-to-the-server-but-not-to-a-database">Access to the Server, but not to a Database</h4> <p>If you can connect to the server, but not to a database, for example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">USE test;
ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'ian'@'localhost' to database 'test'
</pre>
<p>or can connect to a particular database, but not another, for example <code>mariadb -uname -p -u name db1</code> works but not <code>mariadb -uname -p -u name db2</code>, you have not been granted permission for the particular database. See the <a href="../grant/index.html">GRANT</a> article.</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="option-files-and-environment-variables">Option Files and Environment Variables</h4> <p>It's possible that option files or environment variables may be providing incorrect connection parameters. Check the values provided in any option files read by the client you are using (see <a href="../mysqld-configuration-files-and-groups/index.html">mysqld Configuration Files and Groups</a> and the documentation for the particular client you're using - see <a href="../clients-and-utilities/index.html">Clients and Utilities</a>).</p> <p>Option files can usually be suppressed with <code>no-defaults</code> option, for example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">mariadb-import --no-defaults ...
</pre>
<h4 class="anchored_heading" id="unable-to-connect-to-a-running-server-lost-root-password">Unable to Connect to a Running Server / Lost root Password</h4> <p>If you are unable to connect to a server, for example because you have lost the root password, you can start the server without using the privilege tables by running the <a href="../mysqld-options/index.html#-skip-grant-tables">--skip-grant-tables</a> option, which gives users full access to all tables. You can then run <a href="../flush/index.html">FLUSH PRIVILEGES</a> to resume using the grant tables, followed by <a href="../set-password/index.html">SET PASSWORD</a> to change the password for an account.</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="localhost-and">localhost and %</h4> <p>You may have created a user with something like:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE USER melisa identified by 'password';
</pre>
<p>This creates a user with the '%' wildcard host. </p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">select user,host from mysql.user where user='melisa';
+--------+------+
| user   | host |
+--------+------+
| melisa | %    |
+--------+------+
</pre>
<p>However, you may still be failing to login from localhost. Some setups create anonymous users, including localhost. So the following records exist in the user table:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">select user,host from mysql.user where user='melisa' or user='';
+--------+-----------+
| user   | host      |
+--------+-----------+
| melisa | %         |
|        | localhost |
+--------+-----------+
</pre>
<p>Since you are connecting from localhost, the anonymous credentials, rather than those for the 'melisa' user, are used. The solution is either to add a new user specific to localhost, or to remove the anonymous localhost user.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="see-also">See Also</h3> <ul start="1">
