<h1>MASTER_GTID_WAIT</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="syntax">Syntax</h2> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">MASTER_GTID_WAIT(gtid-list[, timeout)
</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h2> <p>This function takes a string containing a comma-separated list of <a href="../global-transaction-id/index.html">global transaction id's</a> (similar to the value of, for example, <a href="../global-transaction-id/index.html#gtid_binlog_pos">gtid_binlog_pos</a>). It waits until the value of <a href="../global-transaction-id/index.html#gtid_slave_pos">gtid_slave_pos</a> has the same or higher seq_no within all replication domains specified in the gtid-list; in other words, it waits until the slave has reached the specified GTID position.</p> <p>An optional second argument gives a timeout in seconds. If the timeout expires before the specified GTID position is reached, then the function returns -1. Passing NULL or a negative number for the timeout means no timeout, and the function will wait indefinitely.</p> <p> If the wait completes without a timeout, 0 is returned. Passing NULL for the gtid-list makes the function return NULL immediately, without waiting.</p> <p>The gtid-list may be the empty string, in which case MASTER_GTID_WAIT() returns immediately. If the gtid-list contains fewer domains than <a href="../global-transaction-id/index.html#gtid_slave_pos">gtid_slave_pos</a>, then only those domains are waited upon. If gtid-list contains a domain that is not present in @@gtid_slave_pos, then MASTER_GTID_WAIT() will wait until an event containing such domain_id arrives on the slave (or until timed out or killed).</p> <p>MASTER_GTID_WAIT() can be useful to ensure that a slave has caught up to a master. Simply take the value of <a href="../global-transaction-id/index.html#gtid_binlog_pos">gtid_binlog_pos</a> on the master, and use it in a MASTER_GTID_WAIT() call on the slave; when the call completes, the slave will have caught up with that master position.</p> <p>MASTER_GTID_WAIT() can also be used in client applications together with the <a href="../global-transaction-id/index.html#last_gtid">last_gtid</a> session variable. This is useful in a read-scaleout <a href="../replication/index.html">replication</a> setup, where the application writes to a single master but divides the reads out to a number of slaves to distribute the load. In such a setup, there is a risk that an application could first do an update on the master, and then a bit later do a read on a slave, and if the slave is not fast enough, the data read from the slave might not include the update just made, possibly confusing the application and/or the end-user. One way to avoid this is to request the value of <a href="../global-transaction-id/index.html#last_gtid">last_gtid</a> on the master just after the update. Then before doing the read on the slave, do a MASTER_GTID_WAIT() on the value obtained from the master; this will ensure that the read is not performed until the slave has replicated sufficiently far for the update to have become visible.</p> <p>Note that MASTER_GTID_WAIT() can be used even if the slave is configured not to use GTID for connections (<a href="../change-master-to/index.html#master_use_gtid">CHANGE MASTER TO master_use_gtid=no</a>). This is because from MariaDB 10, GTIDs are always logged on the master server, and always recorded on the slave servers.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="differences-to-master_pos_wait">Differences to MASTER_POS_WAIT()</h2> <ul start="1"><li>MASTER_GTID_WAIT() is global; it waits for any master connection to reach the specified GTID position. <a href="../master_pos_wait/index.html">MASTER_POS_WAIT()</a> works only against a specific connection. This also means that while MASTER_POS_WAIT() aborts if its master connection is terminated with <a href="../stop-slave/index.html">STOP SLAVE</a> or due to an error, MASTER_GTID_WAIT() continues to wait while slaves are stopped. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>MASTER_GTID_WAIT() can take its timeout as a floating-point value, so a timeout in fractional seconds is supported, eg. MASTER_GTID_WAIT("0-1-100", 0.5). (The minimum wait is one microsecond, 0.000001 seconds). </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>MASTER_GTID_WAIT() allows one to specify a timeout of zero in order to do a non-blocking check to see if the slaves have progressed to a specific GTID position (MASTER_POS_WAIT() takes a zero timeout as meaning an infinite wait). To do an infinite MASTER_GTID_WAIT(), specify a negative timeout, or omit the timeout argument. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>MASTER_GTID_WAIT() does not return the number of events executed since the wait started, nor does it return NULL if a slave thread is stopped. It always returns either 0 for successful wait completed, or -1 for timeout reached (or NULL if the specified gtid-pos is NULL). </li></ul> <p>Since MASTER_GTID_WAIT() looks only at the seq_no part of the GTIDs, not the server_id, care is needed if a slave becomes diverged from another server so that two different GTIDs with the same seq_no (in the same domain) arrive at the same server. This situation is in any case best avoided; setting <a href="../global-transaction-id/index.html#gtid_strict_mode">gtid_strict_mode</a> is recommended, as this will prevent any such out-of-order sequence numbers from ever being replicated on a slave.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
