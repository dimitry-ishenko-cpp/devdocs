<h1>Cassandra Storage Engine Future Plans</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <div class="cstm-style bluebox">
<p>CassandraSE is no longer actively being developed and has been removed in <a href="../what-is-mariadb-106/index.html">MariaDB 10.6</a>. See <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-23024">MDEV-23024</a>.</p> </div> <p>These are possible future directions for <a href="../cassandra-storage-engine/index.html">Cassandra Storage Engine</a>. <strong>This is mostly brainstorming, nobody has committed to implementing this</strong>.</p> <p>Unlike MySQL/MariaDB, Cassandra is not suitable for transaction processing. (the only limited scenario that they handle well is append-only databases)</p> <p>Instead, they focus on ability to deliver real-time analytics. This is achieved via the following combination:</p> <ol start="1"><li>Insert/update operations are reduced to inserting a newer version, their implementation (SSTree) allows to make lots of updates at a low cost </li></ol> <ol start="1"><li>The data model is targeted at denormalized data, cassandra docs and user stories all mention the practice of creating/populating a dedicated column family (=table) for each type of query you're going to run. </li></ol> <p>In other words, Cassandra encourages creation/use of materialized VIEWs. Having lots of materialized VIEWs makes updates expensive, but their low cost and non-conflicting nature should offset that.</p> <p>How does one use Cassandra together with an SQL database? I can think of these use cases:</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="use-case-1">use case 1</h2> <ol start="1">
<li>The "OLTP as in SQL" is kept in the SQL database. </li>
<li>Data that's too big for SQL database (such as web views, or clicks) is stored in Cassandra, but can also be accessed from SQL. </li>
</ol> <p>As an example, one can think of a web shop, which provides real-time peeks into analytics data, like amazon's "people who looked at this item, also looked at ..." , or "*today*'s best sellers in this category are ...", etc</p> <p> Generally, CQL (Cassandra Query Language) allows to query Cassandra's data in an SQL-like fashion. </p> <p>Access through a storage engine will additionally allow:</p> <ol start="1">
<li>to get all of the data from one point, instead of rwo </li>
<li>joins betwen SQL and Cassandra's data *might* be more efficent due to Batched Key Access (this remains to be seen) </li>
<li>?? </li>
</ol> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="use-case-2">use case 2</h2> <p>Suppose, all of the system's data is actually stored in an OLTP SQL database. </p> <p>Cassandra is only used as an accelerator for analytical queries. Cassandra won't allow arbitrary, ad-hoc dss-type queries, it will require the DBA to create and maintain appropriate column families (however, it is supposed to give a nearly-instant answers to analytics-type questions).</p> <p>Tasks that currently have no apparent solutions:</p> <ol start="1">
<li>There is no way to replicate data from MySQL/MariaDB into Cassandra. It would be nice if one could update data in MySQL and that would cause appropriate inserts made into all relevant column families in Cassandra. </li>
<li>...</li>
