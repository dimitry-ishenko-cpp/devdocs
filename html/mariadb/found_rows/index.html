</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h2> <p>A <a href="../select/index.html">SELECT</a> statement may include a <a href="../select/index.html#limit">LIMIT</a> clause to restrict the number of rows the server returns to the client. In some cases, it is desirable to know how many rows the statement would have returned without the LIMIT, but without running the statement again. To obtain this row count, include a <a href="../select/index.html#sql_calc_found_rows">SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</a> option in the SELECT statement, and then invoke FOUND_ROWS() afterwards.</p> <p>You can also use FOUND_ROWS() to obtain the number of rows returned by a <a href="../select/index.html">SELECT</a> which does not contain a <a href="../select/index.html#limit">LIMIT</a> clause. In this case you don't need to use the <a href="../select/index.html#sql_calc_found_rows">SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</a> option. This can be useful for example in a <a href="../stored-procedures/index.html">stored procedure</a>.</p> <p>Also, this function works with some other statements which return a resultset, including <a href="../show/index.html">SHOW</a>, <a href="../describe/index.html">DESC</a> and <a href="../help-command/index.html">HELP</a>. For <a href="../delete/index.html">DELETE ... RETURNING</a> you should use <a href="../information-functions-row_count/index.html">ROW_COUNT()</a>. It also works as a <a href="../prepared-statements/index.html">prepared statement</a>, or after executing a prepared statement.</p> <p>Statements which don't return any results don't affect FOUND_ROWS() - the previous value will still be returned.</p> <p><strong>Warning:</strong> When used after a <a href="../call/index.html">CALL</a> statement, this function returns the number of rows selected by the last query in the procedure, not by the whole procedure.</p> <p>Statements using the FOUND_ROWS() function are not <a href="../unsafe-statements-for-replication/index.html">safe for replication</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="examples">Examples</h2> <pre class="fixed wrap" data-language="sql">SHOW ENGINES\G
