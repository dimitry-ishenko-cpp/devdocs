<h1>Limitations/Differences with a MariaDB Server Compiled for Debugging</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>A MariaDB server configured with <code>--with-debug=full</code> has the following differences from a normal MariaDB server:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>You can have maximum of 1000 tables locked at the same time in one statement. (Define <code>MAX_LOCKS</code> in mysys/thrlock.c). This is to detect loops in the used lists. </li>
<li>You can have maximum of 1000 threads locking the same table. (Define <code>MAX_THREADS</code> in mysys/thrlock.c). This is to detect loops in the used lists. </li>
<li>Deadlock detection of mutex will be done at runtime. If wrong mutex handling is found an error will be printed to the error log. (Define <code>SAFE_MUTEX</code>) </li>
<li>Memory overrun/underrun and not freed memory will be reported to the error log (Define <code>SAFEMALLOC</code>) </li>
<li>You can get a trace of what <code>mysqld</code> (and most other binaries) is doing by starting it with the <code>--debug</code> option. The trace is usually put in <code>/tmp</code> or <code>C:\</code> </li>
