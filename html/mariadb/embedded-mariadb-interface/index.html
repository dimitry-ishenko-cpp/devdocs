<h1>Embedded MariaDB Interface</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The embedded MariaDB server, <code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">libmysqld</code> has the identical interface as the <a href="../client-library-for-c/index.html">C client library</a><code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">libmysqclient</code>.</p> <p>The normal usage of the embedded server is to use the normal <code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">mysql.h</code> include file in your application and link with <code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">libmysqld</code> instead of <code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">libmysqlclient</code>.</p> <p>The intention is that one should be able to move from a server/client version of MariaDB to a single server version of MariaDB by just changing which library you link with.</p> <p>This means that the embedded C client API only changes when the normal C API changes, usually only between major releases.</p> <p>The only major change required in your application if you are going to use the embedded server is that you have to call the following functions from your application:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">int mysql_library_init(int argc, char **argv, char **groups)
void mysql_library_end(void);
</pre>
<p>This is also safe to do when using the standard C library.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="notes">Notes</h2> <ul start="1">
<li>libmysqld.so has many more exported symbols than the C library to allow one to expose and use more parts of MariaDB. In normal applications one should not use them, as they may change between every release. </li>
<li>Before <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-5560-release-notes/">MariaDB 5.5.60</a> (<a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10035-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.0.35</a>, <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10133-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.1.33</a>, <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10215-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.2.15</a>, <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1037-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.3.7</a>), the embedded server library did not support SSL when it was used to connect to remote servers. </li>
<li>Starting with <a href="../what-is-mariadb-105/index.html">MariaDB 10.5</a> the embedded server library and related test binaries are no longer part of binary tarball release archives. </li>
