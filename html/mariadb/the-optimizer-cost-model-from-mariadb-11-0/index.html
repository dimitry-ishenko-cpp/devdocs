<h1>The Optimizer Cost Model from MariaDB 11.0</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="background">Background</h2> <p>Before <a href="../what-is-mariadb-110/index.html">MariaDB 11.0</a>, the MariaDB Query optimizer used a 'basic cost' of 1 for:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>One disk access </li>
<li>Fetching a key </li>
<li>Fetching a row based on the rowid (= unique row identifier) from the key </li>
</ul> <p>There were some smaller costs:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>filter lookup: 0.01 </li>
<li>Examining a where clause: 0.20 </li>
<li>Comparing two keys: 0.05 </li>
<li>Fetching a row through an index from a temporary memory table: 0.05 </li>
</ul> <p>The above costs are reasonable for finding out the best index to use. However, they where not good for finding out if we should use a table scan, index scan or range lookup. The cost for the different engines were not properly calibrated.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="new-cost-model">New Cost Model</h2> <p>In <a href="../what-is-mariadb-110/index.html">MariaDB 11.0</a> we have fixed the above shortcomings by changing the basic cost for 'storage engine operations' to be 1 millisecond. This means that for most queries the query cost (<code>LAST_QUERY_COST</code>) should be close (or at least proportional) to the time the server is spending in the storage engine + join_cache + sorting.</p> <p>Note that the user level costs are in <strong>microseconds</strong> (as milliseconds would have so many zero's that it makes it hard to compare values).</p> <p>The engine costs have also been separated into smaller parts to make things more accurate.</p> <p>The "disk"-read cost now assumes a mid level SSD disk with 400MB/second. This can be changed by the end user by modifying <code>OPTIMIZER_DISK_READ_COST</code>.</p> <p>All engine specific costs are visible in <code>information_schema.optimizer_costs</code>.</p> <p>For example:</p> <p>The "default" cost for an engine can be found with:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"> select * from information_schema.optimizer_costs where engine="default"\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                         ENGINE: default
       OPTIMIZER_DISK_READ_COST: 10.240000
OPTIMIZER_INDEX_BLOCK_COPY_COST: 0.035600
     OPTIMIZER_KEY_COMPARE_COST: 0.011361
        OPTIMIZER_KEY_COPY_COST: 0.015685
      OPTIMIZER_KEY_LOOKUP_COST: 0.435777
   OPTIMIZER_KEY_NEXT_FIND_COST: 0.082347
      OPTIMIZER_DISK_READ_RATIO: 0.020000
        OPTIMIZER_ROW_COPY_COST: 0.060866
      OPTIMIZER_ROW_LOOKUP_COST: 0.130839
   OPTIMIZER_ROW_NEXT_FIND_COST: 0.045916
   OPTIMIZER_ROWID_COMPARE_COST: 0.002653
      OPTIMIZER_ROWID_COPY_COST: 0.002653
</pre>
<p>The above costs are the default (base) for all engines and should be reasonable for engines that does not have a clustered index (like <a href="../myisam/index.html">MyISAM</a>, <a href="../aria/index.html">Aria</a> etc). The default costs can be changed by specifying just the cost as an argument, like <code>mariadbd --optimizer-disk-read-cost=20</code> or from SQL: <code>set global optimizer_disk_read_cost=20</code>. An engine specific cost can be tuned by prefixing the cost with the engine name, like <code>set global innodb.optimizer_disk_read_cost=20</code>. </p> <p>An engine can tune some or all of the above cost in the storage engine interface. Here follows the cost for the <a href="../innodb/index.html">InnoDB storage engine</a>.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">select * from information_schema.optimizer_costs where engine="innodb"\G

<p>As can be seen, the <code>ROW_LOOKUP_COST</code> is close to the <code>KEY_LOOKUP_COST</code>, which is because InnoDB has clustered primary key indexes and is using it to find the row from a secondary index.</p> <p>Some engines, like <code>HEAP</code>/<code>MEMORY</code> implement their own cost functions as different indexes in the same engine can have different costs. This is why some of the cost numbers for these engines are 0.</p> <p>There are also some SQL level costs that are independent of the storage engine:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">select * from information_schema.global_variables where variable_name like "%where%cost%" or variable_name like "%scan%cost%";

This is to avoid the following problem: <ul start="1"><li>table t1 with 1 million_rows is scanned <ul start="1"><li>For each row we do a lookup in table t2, which has only 10 rows </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>If we would count all lookups in t2, there would be 1 million lookups. If this would be the case, the optimizer would choose to use a join cache on the rows in t1 and do a table scan over t2.</p> <ul start="1"><li>The cost of sorting (filesort) is now more accurate, which allows the optimizer to better choose between index scan and filesort for <code>ORDER BY/GROUP BY</code> queries. </li></ul> <p>A lot of rule-based cost has been changed to be cost-based:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>The decision to use an index (and which index) for resolving <code>ORDER BY/GROUP BY</code> were only partly cost-based before. </li>
<li>The old optimizer would limit the number of ‘expected key lookups’ to 10% of the number of rows. This would cause the optimizer to use an index to scan a big part of a table when a full table scan would be much faster. This code is now removed. </li>
<li>InnoDB would limit the number of rows in a range to 50% of the total rows, which would confuse the optimizer for big ranges. The cap is now removed. </li>
<li>If there was a usable filter for an index, it was sometimes used without checking the complete cost of the filter. </li>
<li>‘Aggregate distinct optimization with indexes’ is now cost-based. This will change many queries from "Using index for group-by (scanning)” to “Using index for group-by”. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="other-notable-plan-changes">Other Notable Plan Changes</h2> <ul start="1">
<li>Indexes can now be used for <code>ORDER BY/GROUP BY</code> in sub queries (instead of filesort) </li>
<li>Derived tables and queries with <code>UNION</code> can now create a distinct key (instead of a key with duplicates) to speed up key accesses. </li>
<li>Indexes with more used key parts are preferred if the number of resulting rows is the same: <ul start="1">
<li>
<code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">key_part_1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">key_part_2</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
</code> </li>
<li>This will now use a <code>RANGE</code> over both key parts instead of using lookups on key_part_1. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li>For very small tables, index lookup is preferred over table scan. </li>
<li>
<code>EXPLAIN</code> does not report "Using index" for scans using a clustered primary key as technically this a table scan. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="when-the-optimizer-changes-matter">When the Optimizer Changes Matter</h2> <p>The new, improved optimizer should be able to find a better plan</p> <ul start="1">
<li>If you are using queries with more than two tables. </li>
<li>If you have indexes with a lot of identical values. </li>
<li>If you are using ranges that cover more than 10% of a table. <ul start="1"><li>
<code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="k">key</span> <span class="k">between</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="mi">1000</span>  <span class="c1">-- Table has values 1-2000 </span>
</code> </li></ul> </li>
<li>If you have complex queries when not all used columns are or can be indexed. <ul><li>In which case you may need to depend on selectivity to get the right plan. </li></ul> </li>
<li>If you are using queries mixing different storage engines. <ul start="1"><li>Like using tables from both InnoDB and Memory in the same query. </li></ul> </li>
<li>If you have had to use <code>FORCE INDEX</code> to get a good plan. </li>
<li>If using <a href="../analyze-table/index.html">ANALYZE TABLE</a> made your plans worse (or not good enough). </li>
<li>If your queries have lots of derived tables (subselects). </li>
<li>You are using <code>ORDER BY / GROUP BY</code> that could be resolved via indexes. </li>
