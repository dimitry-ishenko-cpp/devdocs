<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h2> <p>The <code>DECLARE ... HANDLER</code> statement specifies handlers that each may deal with one or more conditions. If one of these conditions occurs, the specified statement is executed. statement can be a simple statement (for example, <code>SET var_name = value</code>), or it can be a compound statement written using <a href="../begin-end/index.html">BEGIN and END</a>.</p> <p>Handlers must be declared after local variables, a <code>CONDITION</code> and a <a href="../programmatic-and-compound-statements-cursors/index.html">CURSOR</a>.</p> <p>For a <code>CONTINUE</code> handler, execution of the current program continues after execution of the handler statement. For an EXIT handler, execution terminates for the <a href="../begin-end/index.html">BEGIN ... END</a> compound statement in which the handler is declared. (This is true even if the condition occurs in an inner block.) The <code>UNDO</code> handler type statement is not supported.</p> <p>If a condition occurs for which no handler has been declared, the default action is <code>EXIT</code>.</p> <p>A condition_value for <code>DECLARE ... HANDLER</code> can be any of the following values:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>An <a href="../sqlstate/index.html">SQLSTATE</a> value (a 5-character string literal) or a MariaDB error code (a number). You should not use <code>SQLSTATE</code> value '00000' or MariaDB error code 0, because those indicate sucess rather than an error condition. For a list of <code>SQLSTATE</code> values and MariaDB error codes, see <a href="../mariadb-error-codes/index.html">MariaDB Error Codes</a>. </li>
<li>A condition name previously specified with <code>DECLARE ... CONDITION</code>. It must be in the same stored program. See <a href="../declare-condition/index.html">DECLARE CONDITION</a>. </li>
<li>
<code>SQLWARNING</code> is shorthand for the class of SQLSTATE values that begin with '01'. </li>
<li>
<code>NOT FOUND</code> is shorthand for the class of <code>SQLSTATE</code> values that begin with '02'. This is relevant only the context of cursors and is used to control what happens when a cursor reaches the end of a data set. If no more rows are available, a No Data condition occurs with <code>SQLSTATE</code> value 02000. To detect this condition, you can set up a handler for it (or for a <code>NOT FOUND</code> condition). An example is shown in <a href="../cursor-overview/index.html">Cursor Overview</a>. This condition also occurs for <a href="../select-into/index.html">SELECT ... INTO</a> var_list statements that retrieve no rows. </li>
<li>SQLEXCEPTION is shorthand for the class of SQLSTATE values that do not begin with '00', '01', or '02'. </li>
</ul> <p>When an error raises, in some cases it could be handled by multiple <code>HANDLER</code>s. For example, there may be an handler for 1050 error, a separate handler for the 42S01 SQLSTATE, and another separate handler for the <code>SQLEXCEPTION</code> class: in theory all occurrences of <code>HANDLER</code> may catch the 1050 error, but MariaDB chooses the <code>HANDLER</code> with the highest precedence. Here are the precedence rules:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Handlers which refer to an error code have the highest precedence. </li>
<li>Handlers which refer to a SQLSTATE come next. </li>
<li>Handlers which refer to an error class have the lowest precedence. </li>
</ul> <p>In some cases, a statement could produce multiple errors. If this happens, in some cases multiple handlers could have the highest precedence. In such cases, the choice of the handler is indeterminate.</p> <p>Note that if an error occurs within a <code>CONTINUE HANDLER</code> block, it can be handled by another <code>HANDLER</code>. However, a <code>HANDLER</code> which is already in the stack (that is, it has been called to handle an error and its execution didn't finish yet) cannot handle new errors<span>â€”</span>this prevents endless loops. For example, suppose that a stored procedure contains a <code>CONTINUE HANDLER</code> for <code>SQLWARNING</code> and another <code>CONTINUE HANDLER</code> for <code>NOT FOUND</code>. At some point, a NOT FOUND error occurs, and the execution enters the <code>NOT FOUND HANDLER</code>. But within that handler, a warning occurs, and the execution enters the <code>SQLWARNING HANDLER</code>. If another <code>NOT FOUND</code> error occurs, it cannot be handled again by the <code>NOT FOUND HANDLER</code>, because its execution is not finished.</p> <p>When a <code>DECLARE HANDLER</code> block can handle more than one error condition, it may be useful to know which errors occurred. To do so, you can use the <a href="../get-diagnostics/index.html">GET DIAGNOSTICS</a> statement.</p> <p>An error that is handled by a <code>DECLARE HANDLER</code> construct can be issued again using the <a href="../resignal/index.html">RESIGNAL</a> statement.</p> <p>Below is an example using <code>DECLARE HANDLER</code>:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE test.t (s1 INT, PRIMARY KEY (s1));

DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE handlerdemo ( )
     BEGIN
       DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '23000' SET @x2 = 1;
       SET @x = 1;
       INSERT INTO test.t VALUES (1);
       SET @x = 2;
       INSERT INTO test.t VALUES (1);
