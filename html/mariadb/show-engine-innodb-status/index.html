<h1>SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p><code>SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS</code> is a specific form of the <a href="../show-engine/index.html">SHOW ENGINE</a> statement that displays the <a href="../innodb-monitors/index.html">InnoDB Monitor</a> output, which is extensive InnoDB information which can be useful in diagnosing problems.</p> <p>The following sections are displayed</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<strong>Status:</strong> Shows the timestamp, monitor name and the number of seconds, or the elapsed time between the current time and the time the InnoDB Monitor output was last displayed. The per-second averages are based upon this time. </li>
<li>
<strong>BACKGROUND THREAD:</strong> srv_master_thread lines show work performed by the main background thread. </li>
<li>
<strong>SEMAPHORES:</strong> Threads waiting for a semaphore and stats on how the number of times threads have needed a spin or a wait on a mutex or rw-lock semaphore. If this number of threads is large, there may be I/O or contention issues. Reducing the size of the <a href="../xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/index.html#innodb_thread_concurrency">innodb_thread_concurrency</a> system variable may help if contention is related to thread scheduling. <code>Spin rounds per wait</code> shows the number of spinlock rounds per OS wait for a mutex. </li>
<li>
<strong>LATEST FOREIGN KEY ERROR:</strong> Only shown if there has been a foreign key constraint error, it displays the failed statement and information about the constraint and the related tables. </li>
<li>
<strong>LATEST DETECTED DEADLOCK:</strong> Only shown if there has been a deadlock, it displays the transactions involved in the deadlock and the statements being executed, held and required locked and the transaction rolled back to. </li>
<li>
<strong>TRANSACTIONS:</strong> The output of this section can help identify lock contention, as well as reasons for the deadlocks. </li>
<li>
<strong>FILE I/O:</strong> InnoDB thread information as well as pending I/O operations and I/O performance statistics. </li>
<li>
<strong>INSERT BUFFER AND ADAPTIVE HASH INDEX:</strong> InnoDB insert buffer (old name for the <a href="../innodb-change-buffering/index.html">change buffer</a>) and adaptive hash index status information, including the number of each type of operation performed, and adaptive hash index performance. </li>
<li>
<strong>LOG:</strong> InnoDB log information, including current log sequence number, how far the log has been flushed to disk, the position at which InnoDB last took a checkpoint, pending writes and write performance statistics. </li>
<li>
<strong>BUFFER POOL AND MEMORY:</strong> Information on buffer pool pages read and written, which allows you to see the number of data file I/O operations performed by your queries. See <a href="../innodb-buffer-pool/index.html">InnoDB Buffer Pool</a> for more. Similar information is also available from the <a href="../information-schema-innodb_buffer_pool_stats-table/index.html">INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_STATS</a> table. </li>
<li>
<strong>ROW OPERATIONS:</strong>Information about the main thread, including the number and performance rate for each type of row operation. </li>
</ul> <p>If the <a href="../xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/index.html#innodb_status_output_locks">innodb_status_output_locks</a> system variable is set to <code>1</code>, extended lock information will be displayed.</p> <p>Example output:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">=====================================
