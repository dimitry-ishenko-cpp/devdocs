<h1>Subquery Limitations</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> <br><br> There are a number of limitations regarding <a href="../subqueries/index.html">subqueries</a>, which are discussed below. <br><br> The following tables and data will be used in the examples that follow: <br><br><br></p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE staff(name VARCHAR(10),age TINYINT);

CREATE TABLE customer(name VARCHAR(10),age TINYINT);
</pre>
<pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">INSERT INTO staff VALUES 
('Bilhah',37), ('Valerius',61), ('Maia',25);

INSERT INTO customer VALUES 
('Thanasis',48), ('Valerius',61), ('Brion',51);
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="order-by-and-limit">ORDER BY and LIMIT</h3> <p>To use <a href="../order-by/index.html">ORDER BY</a> or limit <a href="../limit/index.html">LIMIT</a> in <a href="../subqueries/index.html">subqueries</a> both must be used.. For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM staff WHERE name IN (SELECT name FROM customer ORDER BY name);
+----------+------+
| name     | age  |
+----------+------+
| Valerius |   61 |

</pre>
<p>is valid, but </p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM staff WHERE name IN (SELECT NAME FROM customer ORDER BY name LIMIT 1);
ERROR 1235 (42000): This version of MariaDB doesn't 
  yet support 'LIMIT &amp; IN/ALL/ANY/SOME subquery'
</pre>
<p>is not.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="modifying-and-selecting-from-the-same-table">Modifying and Selecting from the Same Table</h3> <p>It's not possible to both modify and select from the same table in a subquery. For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">DELETE FROM staff WHERE name = (SELECT name FROM staff WHERE age=61);
ERROR 1093 (HY000): Table 'staff' is specified twice, both 
  as a target for 'DELETE' and as a separate source for data
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="row-comparison-operations">Row Comparison Operations</h3> <p>There is only partial support for row comparison operations. The expression in</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">expr op {ALL|ANY|SOME} subquery,
</pre>
<p>must be scalar and the subquery can only return a single column.</p> <p>However, because of the way <code>IN</code> is implemented (it is rewritten as a sequence of <code>=</code> comparisons and <code>AND</code>), the expression in </p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">expression [NOT] IN subquery
</pre>
<p>is permitted to be an n-tuple and the subquery can return rows of n-tuples. </p> <p>For example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM staff WHERE (name,age) NOT IN (
  SELECT name,age FROM customer WHERE age &gt;=51]
);
+--------+------+
| name   | age  |
+--------+------+
| Bilhah |   37 |
| Maia   |   25 |
+--------+------+
</pre>
<p>is permitted, but </p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM staff WHERE (name,age) = ALL (
  SELECT name,age FROM customer WHERE age &gt;=51
);
ERROR 1241 (21000): Operand should contain 1 column(s)
</pre>
<p>is not.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="correlated-subqueries">Correlated Subqueries</h3> <p>Subqueries in the FROM clause cannot be correlated subqueries. They cannot be evaluated for each row of the outer query since they are evaluated to produce a result set during when the query is executed.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="stored-functions">Stored Functions</h3> <p>A subquery can refer to a <a href="../stored-functions/index.html">stored function</a> which modifies data. This is an extension to the SQL standard, but can result in indeterminate outcomes. For example, take:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT ... WHERE x IN (SELECT f() ...);
</pre>
<p>where <em>f()</em> inserts rows. The function <em>f()</em> could be executed a different number of times depending on how the optimizer chooses to handle the query.</p> <p>This sort of construct is therefore not safe to use in replication that is not <a href="../binary-log-formats/index.html">row-based</a>, as there could be different results on the master and the slave.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
