<h1>Creating a New Merge Tree</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <div class="cstm-style redbox">
<p>This article is obsolete. We don't use bzr anymore. This howto needs to be rewritten to explain how to create a merge tree in git.</p> </div>
<p><strong>Merge tree</strong> in the context of this HOWTO is a tree created specifically to simplify merges of third-party packages into MariaDB. WIth a merge tree there's a clear separation between upstream changes and our changes and in most cases bzr can do the merges automatically.</p> <p>Here's how I created a merge tree for pcre:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>prerequisites: we already have pcre in the MariaDB tree, together with our changes (otherwise one can trivially create a bzr repository out of source pcre tarball). </li>
<li>create an empty repository: </li>
</ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">mkdir pcre
cd pcre
bzr init
</pre>
<ul start="1">
<li>download pcre source tarball of the same version that we have in the tree — <code>pcre-8.34.tar.bz2</code> </li>
<li>unpack it in the same place where the files are in the source tree: </li>
</ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">tar xf ~/pcre-8.34.tar.bz2
mv pcre-8.34 pcre
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>Add files to the repository <strong>with the same file-ids as in the MariaDB tree!</strong> </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">bzr add --file-ids-from ~/Abk/mysql/10.0
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>All done. Commit and push </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">bzr commit -m pcre-8.34
bzr push --remember lp:~maria-captains/maria/pcre-mergetree
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>Now null-merge that into your MariaDB tree. Note, that for the initial merge you need to specify the revision range <code>0..1</code> </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">cd ~/Abk/mysql/10.0
bzr merge -r 0..1 ~/mergetrees/pcre/
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>Remove pcre files that shouldn't be in MariaDB tree, revert all changes that came from pcre (remember — it's a null-merge, pcre-8.34 is already in MariaDB tree), rename files in place as needed, resolve conflicts: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">bzr rm `bzr added`
bzr revert --no-backup `bzr modified`
bzr resolve pcre
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>Verify that the tree is unchanged and commit: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">bzr status
bzr commit -m 'pcre-8.34 mergetree initial merge'
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>Congratulations, your new merge tree is ready! </li></ul> <p>Now see <a href="../merging-with-a-merge-tree/index.html">Merging with a merge tree</a>.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
