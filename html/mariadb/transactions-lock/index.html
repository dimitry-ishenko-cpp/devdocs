<p>MariaDB enables client sessions to acquire table locks explicitly for the purpose of cooperating with other sessions for access to tables, or to prevent other sessions from modifying tables during periods when a session requires exclusive access to them. A session can acquire or release locks only for itself. One session cannot acquire locks for another session or release locks held by another session.</p> <p>Locks may be used to emulate transactions or to get more speed when updating tables.</p> <p><code>LOCK TABLES</code> explicitly acquires table locks for the current client session. Table locks can be acquired for base tables or views. To use <code>LOCK TABLES</code>, you must have the <code>LOCK TABLES</code> privilege, and the <code>SELECT</code> privilege for each object to be locked. See <code><a href="../grant/index.html">GRANT</a></code></p> <p>For view locking, <code>LOCK TABLES</code> adds all base tables used in the view to the set of tables to be locked and locks them automatically. If you lock a table explicitly with <code>LOCK TABLES</code>, any tables used in triggers are also locked implicitly, as described in <a href="../triggers-and-implicit-locks/index.html">Triggers and Implicit Locks</a>.</p> <p><a href="../transactions-unlock-tables/index.html">UNLOCK TABLES</a> explicitly releases any table locks held by the current session. <br><br></p> <div class="mariadb_from_10_3_0 mariadb from_10_3_0 product">

<li>
<code>LOCK TABLES</code> <a href="../mariadb-galera-cluster-known-limitations/index.html">doesn't work when using Galera cluster</a>. You may experience crashes or locks when used with Galera. </li>
<li>
<code>LOCK TABLES</code> works on XtraDB/InnoDB tables only if the <a href="../xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/index.html#innodb_table_locks">innodb_table_locks</a> system variable is set to 1 (the default) and <a href="../server-system-variables/index.html#autocommit">autocommit</a> is set to 0 (1 is default). Please note that no error message will be returned on LOCK TABLES with innodb_table_locks = 0. </li>
<li>
<code>LOCK TABLES</code> <a href="../sql-statements-that-cause-an-implicit-commit/index.html">implicitly commits</a> the active transaction, if any. Also, starting a transaction always releases all table locks acquired with LOCK TABLES. This means that there is no way to have table locks and an active transaction at the same time. The only exceptions are the transactions in <a href="../start-transaction/index.html#autocommit">autocommit</a> mode. To preserve the data integrity between transactional and non-transactional tables, the <a href="../get_lock/index.html">GET_LOCK()</a> function can be used. </li>
<li>When using <code>LOCK TABLES</code> on a <code>TEMPORARY</code> table, it will always be locked with a <code>WRITE</code> lock. </li>
<li>While a connection holds an explicit read lock on a table, it cannot modify it. If you try, the following error will be produced: </li>
