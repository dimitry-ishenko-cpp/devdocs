<h1>Delayed Replication</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <div class="cstm-style bluebox text">
<p>The terms <em>master</em> and <em>slave</em> have historically been used in replication, but the terms terms <em>primary</em> and <em>replica</em> are now preferred. The old terms are used still used in parts of the documentation, and in MariaDB commands, although <a href="../what-is-mariadb-105/index.html">MariaDB 10.5</a> has begun the process of renaming. The documentation process is ongoing. See <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18777">MDEV-18777</a> to follow progress on this effort.</p> </div>
<p> Delayed replication allows specifying that a replica should lag behind the primary by (at least) a specified amount of time (specified in seconds). Before executing an event, the replica will first wait, if necessary, until the given time has passed since the event was created on the primary. The result is that the replica will reflect the state of the primary some time back in the past.</p> <p>The default is zero, or no delay, and the maximum value is 2147483647, or about 68 years.</p> <p>Delayed replication is enabled using the MASTER_DELAY option to <a href="../change-master-to/index.html">CHANGE MASTER</a>:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">  CHANGE MASTER TO master_delay=3600;
</pre>
<p>A zero delay disables delayed replication. The replica must be stopped when changing the delay value.</p> <p>Three fields in <a href="../show-slave-status/index.html">SHOW SLAVE STATUS</a> are associated with delayed replication:</p> <ol start="1">
<li>SQL_Delay: This is the value specified by MASTER_DELAY in CHANGE MASTER (or 0 if none). </li>
<li>SQL_Remaining_Delay. When the replica is delaying the execution of an event due to MASTER_DELAY, this is the number of seconds of delay remaining before the event will be applied. Otherwise, the value is NULL. </li>
<li>Slave_SQL_Running_State. This shows the state of the SQL driver threads, same as in <a href="../show-processlist/index.html">SHOW PROCESSLIST</a>. When the replica is delaying the execution of an event due to MASTER_DELAY, this fields displays: "Waiting until MASTER_DELAY seconds after master executed event". </li>
</ol> <p>When using older versions prior to <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1023-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.2.3</a>, a 3rd party tool called <a href="https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-slave-delay.html">pt-slave-delay</a> can be used. It is part of the Percona Toolkit. Note that pt-slave-delay does not support MariaDB multi-channel replication syntax.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
