<h1>Catalog Status Variables</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>When using a MariaDB Server with <a href="../catalogs/index.html">catalogs</a> support, all status information is collected for the whole server, per catalog and per user.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW SERVER STATUS;
</pre>
<p>shows the status for the whole server. Note that only the super user in the 'def' catalog has privileges for the above statement.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW GLOBAL STATUS;
SHOW CATALOG STATUS;
</pre>
<p>Both commands show the status for the current catalog. The reason that <code>GLOBAL</code> shows catalog status is that because catalogs are 'multi-tenant', a catalog user should not be able to see the status from other users (for most things).</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW [SESSION] STATUS;
</pre>
<p>Shows the status for the current connection.</p> <p>The main "new thing" is that catalogs enable SAS providers to see the status for a single tenant (catalog user). This makes it much easier to find 'bad neighbors' (tenants that cause problems for other tenants) so that they can be moved to other servers.</p> <p>When the MariaDB server is not configured for catalogs, the following commands are equivalent:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW GLOBAL STATUS
SHOW SERVER STATUS 
SHOW CATALOG STATUS
</pre>
