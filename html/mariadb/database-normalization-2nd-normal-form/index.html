<h1>Database Normalization: 2nd Normal Form</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <div class="cstm-style bluebox">
<p>This article follows on from <a href="../database-normalization-1st-normal-form/index.html">Database Normalization: 1st Normal Form</a>.</p> </div>
<p>After converting to first normal form, the following table structure was achieved:</p> <div class="cstm-style darkheader-nospace-borders">
<table>
<tr><th>Plant location table</th></tr> <tr><td><em>Location code</em></td></tr> <tr><td>Location name</td></tr> <tr><td><em>Plant code</em></td></tr> <tr><td>Plant name</td></tr> <tr><td>Soil category</td></tr> <tr><td>Soil description</td></tr> </table> </div>
<p>Is this in 2nd normal form?</p> <p>A table is in 2nd normal form if:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>it is in 1st normal form </li>
<li>it includes no partial dependencies (where an attribute is only dependent on part of a primary key) </li>
</ul> <div class="cstm-style bluebox">
<p>For an attribute to be only dependent on part of the primary key, the primary key must consist of more than one field. If the primary key contains only one field, the table is automatically in 2nd normal form if it is in 1st normal form</p> </div>
<p>Let's examine all the fields. <em>Location name</em> is only dependent on <em>location code</em>. <em>Plant name</em>, <em>soil category</em>, and <em>soil description</em> are only dependent on <em>plant code</em> (this assumes that each plant only occurs in one soil type, which is the case in this example). So you remove each of these fields and place them in a separate table, with the key being that part of the original key on which they are dependent. For example, with <em>plant name</em>, the key is <em>plant code</em>. This leaves you with the tables below:</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="plant-location-table-with-partial-dependencies-removed">Plant location table with partial dependencies removed</h3> <div class="cstm-style darkheader-nospace-borders">
<table>
<tr><th>Plant location table</th></tr> <tr><td><em>Plant code</em></td></tr> <tr><td><em>Location code</em></td></tr> </table> </div>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="table-resulting-from-fields-dependent-on-plant-code">Table resulting from fields dependent on plant code</h3> <div class="cstm-style darkheader-nospace-borders">
<table>
<tr><th>Plant table</th></tr> <tr><td><em>Plant code</em></td></tr> <tr><td>Plant name</td></tr> <tr><td>Soil category</td></tr> <tr><td>Soil description</td></tr> </table> </div>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="table-resulting-from-fields-dependent-on-location-code">Table resulting from fields dependent on location code</h3> <div class="cstm-style darkheader-nospace-borders">
<table>
<tr><th>Location table</th></tr> <tr><td><em>Location code</em></td></tr> <tr><td>Location name</td></tr> </table> </div>
<p>The resulting tables are now in 2nd normal form. The process for turning a table into 3rd normal form is continued in the next article.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
