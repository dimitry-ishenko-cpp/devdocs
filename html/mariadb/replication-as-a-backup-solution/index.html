<h1>Replication as a Backup Solution</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p><a href="../replication/index.html">Replication</a> can be used to support the <a href="../backing-up-and-restoring/index.html">backup</a> strategy.</p> <div class="cstm-style redbox">
<p>Replication alone is <em>not</em> sufficient for backup. It assists in protecting against hardware failure on the primary server, but does not protect against data loss. An accidental or malicious <code>DROP DATABASE</code> or <code>TRUNCATE TABLE</code> statement will be replicated onto the replica as well. Care needs to be taken to prevent data getting out of sync between the primary and the replica.</p> </div>
<div class="cstm-style bluebox text">
<p>The terms <em>master</em> and <em>slave</em> have historically been used in replication, but the terms terms <em>primary</em> and <em>replica</em> are now preferred. The old terms are used still used in parts of the documentation, and in MariaDB commands, although <a href="../what-is-mariadb-105/index.html">MariaDB 10.5</a> has begun the process of renaming. The documentation process is ongoing. See <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18777">MDEV-18777</a> to follow progress on this effort.</p> </div> <p>Replication is most commonly used to support backups as follows:</p> <ul>
<li>A primary server replicates to a replica </li>
<li>Backups are then run off the replica without any impact on the primary. </li>
</ul> <p>Backups can have a significant effect on a server, and a high-availability primary may not be able to be stopped, locked or simply handle the extra load of a backup. Running the backup from a replica has the advantage of being able to shutdown or lock the replica and perform a backup without any impact on the primary server.</p> <p>Note that when backing up off a replica server, it is important to ensure that the servers keep the data in sync. See for example <a href="../replication-and-foreign-keys/index.html">Replication and Foreign Keys</a> for a situation when identical statements can result in different data on a replica and a primary.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="see-also">See Also</h2> <ul>
