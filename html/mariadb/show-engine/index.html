See <code><a href="../show-engine-innodb-status/index.html">SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS</a></code> for more.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="show-engine-innodb-mutex">SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX</h3> <p><code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX</code> displays InnoDB mutex statistics.</p> <p>The statement displays the following output fields:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<strong>Type:</strong> Always InnoDB. </li>
<li>
<strong>Name:</strong> The source file where the mutex is implemented, and the line number in the file where the mutex is created. The line number is dependent on the MariaDB version. </li>
<li>
<strong>Status:</strong> This field displays the following values if <code>UNIV_DEBUG</code> was defined at compilation time (for example, in include/univ.h in the InnoDB part of the source tree). Only the <code>os_waits</code> value is displayed if <code>UNIV_DEBUG</code> was not defined. Without <code>UNIV_DEBUG</code>, the information on which the output is based is insufficient to distinguish regular mutexes and mutexes that protect rw-locks (which allow multiple readers or a single writer). Consequently, the output may appear to contain multiple rows for the same mutex. <ul start="1">
<li>
<strong>count</strong> indicates how many times the mutex was requested. </li>
<li>
<strong>spin_waits</strong> indicates how many times the spinlock had to run. </li>
<li>
<strong>spin_rounds</strong> indicates the number of spinlock rounds. (spin_rounds divided by spin_waits provides the average round count.) </li>
<li>
<strong>os_waits</strong> indicates the number of operating system waits. This occurs when the spinlock did not work (the mutex was not locked during the spinlock and it was necessary to yield to the operating system and wait). </li>
<li>
<strong>os_yields</strong> indicates the number of times a the thread trying to lock a mutex gave up its timeslice and yielded to the operating system (on the presumption that allowing other threads to run will free the mutex so that it can be locked). </li>
<li>
<strong>os_wait_times</strong> indicates the amount of time (in ms) spent in operating system waits, if the timed_mutexes system variable is 1 (ON). If timed_mutexes is 0 (OFF), timing is disabled, so os_wait_times is 0. timed_mutexes is off by default. </li>
</ul> </li>
</ul> <p>Information from this statement can be used to diagnose system problems. For example, large values of spin_waits and spin_rounds may indicate scalability problems.</p> <p>The <code><a href="../information-schema/index.html">information_schema</a>.<a href="../information-schema-innodb_mutexes-table/index.html">INNODB_MUTEXES</a></code> table provides similar information.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="show-engine-performance_schema-status">SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS</h3> <p>This statement shows how much memory is used for <code><a href="../performance-schema/index.html">performance_schema</a></code> tables and internal buffers.</p> <p>The output contains the following fields:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<strong>Type:</strong> Always <code>performance_schema</code>. </li>
<li>
<strong>Name:</strong> The name of a table, the name of an internal buffer, or the <code>performance_schema</code> word, followed by a dot and an attribute. Internal buffers names are enclosed by parenthesis. <code>performance_schema</code> means that the attribute refers to the whole database (it is a total). </li>
<li>
<strong>Status:</strong> The value for the attribute. </li>
</ul> <p>The following attributes are shown, in this order, for all tables:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<strong>row_size:</strong> The memory used for an individual record. This value will never change. </li>
<li>
<strong>row_count:</strong> The number of rows in the table or buffer. For some tables, this value depends on a server system variable. </li>
<li>
<strong>memory:</strong> For tables and <code>performance_schema</code>, this is the result of <code>row_size</code> * <code>row_count</code>. </li>
</ul> <p>For internal buffers, the attributes are:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<strong>count</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>size</strong> </li>
