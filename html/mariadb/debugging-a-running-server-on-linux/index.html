<h1>Debugging a Running Server (on Linux)</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> Even if you don't have a server that is <a href="../compiling-mariadb-for-debugging/index.html">compiled for debugging</a>, there are still ways to get more information out from it if things go wrong.</p> <p>When things go wrong, it's always better to have a version of mysqld daemon that is not stripped.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">shell&gt; file /usr/sbin/mysqld
</pre>
<p>If this doesn't say 'stripped' then you are fine. If not, you should either <a href="https://downloads.mariadb.org">download a binary with debugging information</a> or <a href="../compiling-mariadb-for-debugging/index.html#building-with-debug-symbols">compile it, without stripping the binary</a>.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="debugging-memory-consumption-with-tcmalloc">Debugging Memory Consumption With tcmalloc</h3> <p>If you have a problem with a mysqld process that keeps on growing, you can use tcmalloc to find out what is allocating memory:</p> <p>Depending on the system you have to install the <code>tcmalloc</code> (OpenSuse) or the <code>google-perftools-lib</code> (RedHat, Centos) package.</p> <p>The following set of commands starts mysqld with memory profiling and if you kill it with SIGABRT, you will get a core dump that you can examine:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">HEAPPROFILE=/tmp/mysqld.prof /usr/sbin/mysqld_safe --malloc-lib=tcmalloc --core-file-size=unlimited --core-file
</pre>
<p>or if you prefer to invoke mysqld directly:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">ulimit -c unlimted
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libtcmalloc.so.4 HEAPPROFILE=/tmp/mysqld.prof /usr/sbin/mysqld --core-file
</pre>
<p>You can of course add other <a href="../mysqld-options/index.html">mysqld options</a> to the end of the above line.</p> <p>Now start your client/application that uses MariaDB. You can find where memory is allocated in the <code>/tmp/mysqld.prof</code> file. If you find any memory issues, please report this in the <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa">MariaDB bug tracker</a>!</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="ptrace-protection-and-attaching-gdb-to-a-mysqld-instance">ptrace Protection and Attaching GDB to a mysqld Instance</h3> <p>New Ubuntu releases do not allow one process to examine the memory of an arbitrary user's process. As a result, when trying to attach GDB to a running MariaDB (or any other process) instance, one gets the following error in GDB:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">ptrace: Operation not permitted
</pre>
<p>More details are available in the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Roadmap/KernelHardening#ptrace%20Protection">Ubuntu Wiki</a>.</p> <p>To allow GDB to attach, one needs to edit the value of the <code>/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope</code> sysctl value.</p> <ul start="1">
<li>To change it temporarily, open a root shell and issue:<pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
</pre> </li>
<li>To change it permanently, edit as root: <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">/etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf
</pre> and set the value to <code>0</code>. </li>
</ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="debugging-a-server-that-hangs">Debugging a Server That Hangs</h3> <p>If your mysqld server hangs, you may want to debug it to know what happened.</p> <p>Preferably the server should be compiled for debugging, but it's not strictly necessary:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_VALGRIND=ON .
make -j4
</pre>
<p>To know what the server is doing:</p> <ul start="1"><li>Find out the process number of mysqld </li></ul> <pre class="fixed indent1" data-language="sql">ps -edalf | grep mysqld
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>Attach to the process and get a back trace: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed indent1" data-language="sql">gdb -p 'pid of mysqld' path-to-mysqld
set height 0
set logging file /tmp/mysqld.log
set logging on
thread apply all backtrace full
</pre>
<p>After the above, you have a full backtrace, including all local variables, in the <code>mysqld.log</code> file. Note that you will only get all variables if the server is not stripped.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
