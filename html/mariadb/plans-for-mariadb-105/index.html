<h1>Plans for MariaDB 10.5</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <p><a href="../what-is-mariadb-105/index.html">MariaDB 10.5</a> is stable, so no new features will be added. See <a href="../plans-for-mariadb-106/index.html">Plans for MariaDB 10.6</a> instead.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="jira">JIRA</h2> <p>We manage our development plans in JIRA, so the definitive list will be there. <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/issues/?jql=project+%3D+MDEV+AND+issuetype+%3D+Task+AND+fixVersion+in+%2810.5%29+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC">This search</a> shows what we <strong>currently</strong> plan for 10.5. It shows all tasks with the <strong>Fix-Version</strong> being 10.5. Not all these tasks will really end up in 10.5, but tasks with the "red" priorities have a much higher chance of being done in time for 10.5. Practically, you can think of these tasks as "features that <strong>will</strong> be in 10.5". Tasks with the "green" priorities probably won't be in 10.5. Think of them as "bonus features that would be <strong>nice to have</strong> in 10.5".</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="contributing">Contributing</h2> <p>If you want to be part of developing any of these features, see <a href="../contributing-to-the-mariadb-project/index.html">Contributing to the MariaDB Project</a>. You can also add new features to this list or to <a href="../jira-project-planning-and-tracking/index.html">JIRA</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="see-also">See Also</h2> <ul start="1">
