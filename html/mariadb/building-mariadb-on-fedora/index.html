<h1>Building MariaDB on Fedora</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>In the event that you are using the Linux-based operating system Fedora or any of its derivatives and would like to compile MariaDB from source code, you can do so using the MariaDB build in the official repositories. </p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="installing-build-dependencies">Installing Build Dependencies</h2> <p>MariaDB requires a number of packages to compile from source. Fortunately, you can use the package in the Fedora repository to retrieve most of the relevant build dependencies through DNF.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># dnf builddep mariadb-server
</pre>
<p>Running DNF in this way pulls the build dependencies for the release of MariaDB compiled by your version of Fedora. These may not be all the dependencies you need to build the particular version of MariaDB you want to use, but it will retrieve most of them.</p> <p>You'll also need to install Git to retrieve the source repository:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># dnf install git
</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="building-mariadb">Building MariaDB</h2> <p>Once you have the base dependencies installed, you can retrieve the source code and start building MariaDB. The source code is available on GitHub. Use the <code>--branch</code> option to specify the particular version of MariaDB you want to build.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">$ git clone --branch 10.3 https://github.com/MariaDB/server.git mariadb-server
</pre>
<p>With the source repository cloned onto your system, you can start building MariaDB. Change into the new <code>mariadb-server/</code> directory and run CMake to prepare the build.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">$ mkdir mariadb-build
$ cd mariadb-build
$ cmake -DRPM=fedora ../mariadb-server
</pre>
<p>Once CMake readies the relevant Makefile for your system, use Make to build MariaDB.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">$ make package
