<h1>Installing MariaDB Server on macOS Using Homebrew</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> MariaDB Server is available for installation on macOS (formerly Mac OS X) via the <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> package manager. </p> <p>MariaDB Server is available as a Homebrew "bottle", a pre-compiled package. This means you can install it without having to build from source yourself. This saves time.</p> <p>After installing Homebrew, MariaDB Server can be installed with this command:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">brew install mariadb
</pre>
<p>After installation, start MariaDB Server:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">mysql.server start
</pre>
<p>To auto-start MariaDB Server, use Homebrew's services functionality, which configures auto-start with the launchctl utility from <a href="../launchd/index.html">launchd</a>:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">brew services start mariadb
</pre>
<p>After MariaDB Server is started, you can log in as your user:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">mysql
</pre>
<p>Or log in as root:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sudo mysql -u root
</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="upgrading-mariadb">Upgrading MariaDB</h2> <p>First you may need to update your brew installation:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">brew update
</pre>
<p>Then, to upgrade MariaDB Server:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">brew upgrade mariadb
</pre>
<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="building-mariadb-server-from-source">Building MariaDB Server from source</h2> <p>In addition to the "bottled" MariaDB Server package available from Homebrew, you can use Homebrew to build MariaDB from source. This is useful if you want to use a different version of the server or enable some different capabilities that are not included in the bottle package.</p> <p>Two components not included in the bottle package (as of MariaDB Server 10.1.19) are the CONNECT and OQGRAPH engines, because they have non-standard dependencies. To build MariaDB Server with these engines, you must first install <code>boost</code> and <code>judy</code>. As of December 2016, judy is in the Homebrew "boneyard", but the old formula still works on macOS Sierra. Follow these steps to install the dependencies and build the server:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">brew install boost homebrew/boneyard/judy
brew install mariadb --build-from-source
</pre>
<p>You can also use Homebrew to build and install a pre-release version of MariaDB Server (for example MariaDB Server 10.2, when the highest GA version is MariaDB Server 10.1). Use this command to build and install a "development" version of MariaDB Server:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">brew install mariadb --devel
</pre>
