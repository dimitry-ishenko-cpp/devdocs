<h1>Roles Overview</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h2> <p>A role bundles a number of privileges together. It assists larger organizations where, typically, a number of users would have the same privileges, and, previously, the only way to change the privileges for a group of users was by changing each user's privileges individually. </p> <p>Alternatively, multiple external users could have been assigned the same user, and there would have been no way to see which actual user was responsible for which action.</p> <p>With roles, managing this is easy. For example, there could be a number of users assigned to a journalist role, with identical privileges. Changing the privileges for all the journalists is a matter of simply changing the role's privileges, while the individual user is still linked with any changes that take place.</p> <p>Roles are created with the <a href="../create-role/index.html">CREATE ROLE</a> statement, and dropped with the <a href="../drop-role/index.html">DROP ROLE</a> statement. Roles are then assigned to a user with an extension to the <a href="../grant/index.html#roles">GRANT</a> statement, while privileges are assigned to a role in the regular way with <a href="../grant/index.html">GRANT</a>. Similarly, the <a href="../revoke/index.html">REVOKE</a> statement can be used to both revoke a role from a user, or revoke a privilege from a role.</p> <p>Once a user has connected, he can obtain all privileges associated with a role by <strong>setting</strong> a role with the <a href="../set-role/index.html">SET ROLE</a> statement. The <a href="../current_role/index.html">CURRENT_ROLE</a> function returns the currently set role for the session, if any.</p> <p>Only roles granted directly to a user can be set, roles granted to other roles cannot. Instead the privileges granted to a role, which is, in turn, granted to another role (grantee), will be immediately available to any user who sets this second grantee role.</p> <p>The <a href="../set-default-role/index.html">SET DEFAULT ROLE</a> statement allows one to set a default role for a user. A default role is automatically enabled when a user connects (an implicit SET ROLE statement is executed immediately after a connection is established).</p> <p>Roles were implemented as a GSoC 2013 project by Vicentiu Ciorbaru. </p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="system-tables">System Tables</h2> <p>Information about roles and who they've been granted to can be found in the <a href="../information-schema-applicable_roles-table/index.html">Information Schema APPLICABLE_ROLES table</a> as well as the <a href="../mysqlroles_mapping-table/index.html">mysql.ROLES_MAPPING table</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="../information-schema-enabled_roles-table/index.html">Information Schema ENABLED_ROLES table</a> shows the enabled roles for the current session.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="examples">Examples</h2> <p>Creating a role and granting a privilege:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE ROLE journalist;

GRANT SHOW DATABASES ON *.* TO journalist;

GRANT journalist to hulda;
</pre>
<p>Note, that hulda has no <code>SHOW DATABASES</code> privilege, even though she was granted the journalist role. She needs to <strong>set</strong> the role first:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
+--------------------+

SELECT CURRENT_ROLE;
+--------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE |
+--------------+
| NULL         |
+--------------+

SET ROLE journalist;

SELECT CURRENT_ROLE;
+--------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE |
+--------------+
| journalist   |
+--------------+

SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+

| performance_schema |
| test               |
| ...                |
+--------------------+

SET ROLE NONE;
</pre>
<p>Roles can be granted to roles:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE ROLE writer;

GRANT SELECT ON data.* TO writer;

GRANT writer TO journalist;
</pre>
<p>But one does not need to set a role granted to a role. For example, hulda will automatically get all writer privileges when she sets the journalist role:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT CURRENT_ROLE;
+--------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE |
+--------------+
| NULL         |
+--------------+

SHOW TABLES FROM data;

SET ROLE journalist;

SELECT CURRENT_ROLE;
+--------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE |
+--------------+
| journalist   |
+--------------+

SHOW TABLES FROM data;

| Tables_in_data               |

<h2 class="anchored_heading" id="roles-and-views-and-stored-routines">Roles and Views (and Stored Routines)</h2> <p>When a user sets a role, he, in a sense, has two identities with two associated sets of privileges. But a view (or a stored routine) can have only one definer. So, when a view (or a stored routine) is created with the <code>SQL SECURITY DEFINER</code>, one can specify whether the definer should be <code>CURRENT_USER</code> (and the view will have none of the privileges of the user's role) or <code>CURRENT_ROLE</code> (in this case, the view will use role's privileges, but none of the user's privileges). As a result, sometimes one can create a view that is impossible to use.</p> <pre class="fixed wrap" data-language="sql">CREATE ROLE r1;
