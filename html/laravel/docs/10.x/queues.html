Thankfully, Laravel allows you to easily create queued jobs that may be processed in the background. By moving time intensive tasks to a queue, your application can respond to web requests with blazing speed and provide a better user experience to your customers.</p> <p>Laravel queues provide a unified queueing API across a variety of different queue backends, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon SQS</a>, <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a>, or even a relational database.</p> <p>Laravel's queue configuration options are stored in your application's <code>config/queue.php</code> configuration file. In this file, you will find connection configurations for each of the queue drivers that are included with the framework, including the database, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon SQS</a>, <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a>, and <a href="https://beanstalkd.github.io/">Beanstalkd</a> drivers, as well as a synchronous driver that will execute jobs immediately (for use during local development). A <code>null</code> queue driver is also included which discards queued jobs.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> Laravel now offers Horizon, a beautiful dashboard and configuration system for your Redis powered queues. Check out the full <a href="horizon.html">Horizon documentation</a> for more information.</p> </blockquote>  <h3 id="connections-vs-queues">Connections Vs. Queues</h3> <p>Before getting started with Laravel queues, it is important to understand the distinction between "connections" and "queues". In your <code>config/queue.php</code> configuration file, there is a <code>connections</code> configuration array. This option defines the connections to backend queue services such as Amazon SQS, Beanstalk, or Redis. However, any given queue connection may have multiple "queues" which may be thought of as different stacks or piles of queued jobs.</p> <p>Note that each connection configuration example in the <code>queue</code> configuration file contains a <code>queue</code> attribute. This is the default queue that jobs will be dispatched to when they are sent to a given connection. In other words, if you dispatch a job without explicitly defining which queue it should be dispatched to, the job will be placed on the queue that is defined in the <code>queue</code> attribute of the connection configuration:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast;
 
// This job is sent to the default connection's default queue...
ProcessPodcast::dispatch();
 
// This job is sent to the default connection's "emails" queue...
ProcessPodcast::dispatch()-&gt;onQueue('emails');</pre> <p>Some applications may not need to ever push jobs onto multiple queues, instead preferring to have one simple queue. However, pushing jobs to multiple queues can be especially useful for applications that wish to prioritize or segment how jobs are processed, since the Laravel queue worker allows you to specify which queues it should process by priority. For example, if you push jobs to a <code>high</code> queue, you may run a worker that gives them higher processing priority:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --queue=high,default</pre>  <h3 id="driver-prerequisites">Driver Notes &amp; Prerequisites</h3>  <h4 id="database">Database</h4> <p>In order to use the <code>database</code> queue driver, you will need a database table to hold the jobs. To generate a migration that creates this table, run the <code>queue:table</code> Artisan command. Once the migration has been created, you may migrate your database using the <code>migrate</code> command:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:table
 
php artisan migrate</pre> <p>Finally, don't forget to instruct your application to use the <code>database</code> driver by updating the <code>QUEUE_CONNECTION</code> variable in your application's <code>.env</code> file:</p> <pre data-language="php">QUEUE_CONNECTION=database</pre>  <h4 id="redis">Redis</h4> <p>In order to use the <code>redis</code> queue driver, you should configure a Redis database connection in your <code>config/database.php</code> configuration file.</p> <p><strong>Redis Cluster</strong></p> <p>If your Redis queue connection uses a Redis Cluster, your queue names must contain a <a href="https://redis.io/docs/reference/cluster-spec/#hash-tags">key hash tag</a>. This is required in order to ensure all of the Redis keys for a given queue are placed into the same hash slot:</p> <pre data-language="php">'redis' =&gt; [
    'driver' =&gt; 'redis',
    'connection' =&gt; 'default',
    'queue' =&gt; '{default}',
    'retry_after' =&gt; 90,
],</pre> <p><strong>Blocking</strong></p> <p>When using the Redis queue, you may use the <code>block_for</code> configuration option to specify how long the driver should wait for a job to become available before iterating through the worker loop and re-polling the Redis database.</p> <p>Adjusting this value based on your queue load can be more efficient than continually polling the Redis database for new jobs. For instance, you may set the value to <code>5</code> to indicate that the driver should block for five seconds while waiting for a job to become available:</p> <pre data-language="php">'redis' =&gt; [
    'driver' =&gt; 'redis',
    'connection' =&gt; 'default',
    'queue' =&gt; 'default',
    'retry_after' =&gt; 90,
    'block_for' =&gt; 5,
],</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> Setting <code>block_for</code> to <code>0</code> will cause queue workers to block indefinitely until a job is available. This will also prevent signals such as <code>SIGTERM</code> from being handled until the next job has been processed.</p> </blockquote>  <h4 id="other-driver-prerequisites">Other Driver Prerequisites</h4> <p>The following dependencies are needed for the listed queue drivers. These dependencies may be installed via the Composer package manager:</p> <div class="content-list" markdown="1"> <ul> <li>Amazon SQS: <code>aws/aws-sdk-php ~3.0</code> </li> <li>Beanstalkd: <code>pda/pheanstalk ~4.0</code> </li> <li>Redis: <code>predis/predis ~1.0</code> or phpredis PHP extension</li> </ul> </div>  <h2 id="creating-jobs">Creating Jobs</h2>  <h3 id="generating-job-classes">Generating Job Classes</h3> <p>By default, all of the queueable jobs for your application are stored in the <code>app/Jobs</code> directory. If the <code>app/Jobs</code> directory doesn't exist, it will be created when you run the <code>make:job</code> Artisan command:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan make:job ProcessPodcast</pre> <p>The generated class will implement the <code>Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue</code> interface, indicating to Laravel that the job should be pushed onto the queue to run asynchronously.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> Job stubs may be customized using <a href="artisan.html#stub-customization">stub publishing</a>.</p> </blockquote>  <h3 id="class-structure">Class Structure</h3> <p>Job classes are very simple, normally containing only a <code>handle</code> method that is invoked when the job is processed by the queue. To get started, let's take a look at an example job class. In this example, we'll pretend we manage a podcast publishing service and need to process the uploaded podcast files before they are published:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Jobs;
 
use App\Models\Podcast;
use App\Services\AudioProcessor;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
 
class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;
 
    /**
     * Create a new job instance.
     */
    public function __construct(
        public Podcast $podcast,
    ) {}
 
    /**
     * Execute the job.
     */
    public function handle(AudioProcessor $processor): void
    {
        // Process uploaded podcast...
    }
}</pre> <p>In this example, note that we were able to pass an <a href="eloquent.html">Eloquent model</a> directly into the queued job's constructor. Because of the <code>SerializesModels</code> trait that the job is using, Eloquent models and their loaded relationships will be gracefully serialized and unserialized when the job is processing.</p> <p>If your queued job accepts an Eloquent model in its constructor, only the identifier for the model will be serialized onto the queue. When the job is actually handled, the queue system will automatically re-retrieve the full model instance and its loaded relationships from the database. This approach to model serialization allows for much smaller job payloads to be sent to your queue driver.</p>  <h4 id="handle-method-dependency-injection">
<code>handle</code> Method Dependency Injection</h4> <p>The <code>handle</code> method is invoked when the job is processed by the queue. Note that we are able to type-hint dependencies on the <code>handle</code> method of the job. The Laravel <a href="container.html">service container</a> automatically injects these dependencies.</p> <p>If you would like to take total control over how the container injects dependencies into the <code>handle</code> method, you may use the container's <code>bindMethod</code> method. The <code>bindMethod</code> method accepts a callback which receives the job and the container. Within the callback, you are free to invoke the <code>handle</code> method however you wish. Typically, you should call this method from the <code>boot</code> method of your <code>App\Providers\AppServiceProvider</code> <a href="providers.html">service provider</a>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast;
use App\Services\AudioProcessor;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application;
 
$this-&gt;app-&gt;bindMethod([ProcessPodcast::class, 'handle'], function (ProcessPodcast $job, Application $app) {
    return $job-&gt;handle($app-&gt;make(AudioProcessor::class));
});</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> Binary data, such as raw image contents, should be passed through the <code>base64_encode</code> function before being passed to a queued job. Otherwise, the job may not properly serialize to JSON when being placed on the queue.</p> </blockquote>  <h4 id="handling-relationships">Queued Relationships</h4> <p>Because loaded relationships also get serialized, the serialized job string can sometimes become quite large. To prevent relations from being serialized, you can call the <code>withoutRelations</code> method on the model when setting a property value. This method will return an instance of the model without its loaded relationships:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Create a new job instance.
 */
public function __construct(Podcast $podcast)
{
    $this-&gt;podcast = $podcast-&gt;withoutRelations();
}</pre> <p>Furthermore, when a job is deserialized and model relationships are re-retrieved from the database, they will be retrieved in their entirety. Any previous relationship constraints that were applied before the model was serialized during the job queueing process will not be applied when the job is deserialized. Therefore, if you wish to work with a subset of a given relationship, you should re-constrain that relationship within your queued job.</p> <p>If a job receives a collection or array of Eloquent models instead of a single model, the models within that collection will not have their relationships restored when the job is deserialized and executed. This is to prevent excessive resource usage on jobs that deal with large numbers of models.</p>  <h3 id="unique-jobs">Unique Jobs</h3> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> Unique jobs require a cache driver that supports <a href="cache.html#atomic-locks">locks</a>. Currently, the <code>memcached</code>, <code>redis</code>, <code>dynamodb</code>, <code>database</code>, <code>file</code>, and <code>array</code> cache drivers support atomic locks. In addition, unique job constraints do not apply to jobs within batches.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sometimes, you may want to ensure that only one instance of a specific job is on the queue at any point in time. You may do so by implementing the <code>ShouldBeUnique</code> interface on your job class. This interface does not require you to define any additional methods on your class:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeUnique;
 
class UpdateSearchIndex implements ShouldQueue, ShouldBeUnique
{
    ...
}</pre> <p>In the example above, the <code>UpdateSearchIndex</code> job is unique. So, the job will not be dispatched if another instance of the job is already on the queue and has not finished processing.</p> <p>In certain cases, you may want to define a specific "key" that makes the job unique or you may want to specify a timeout beyond which the job no longer stays unique. To accomplish this, you may define <code>uniqueId</code> and <code>uniqueFor</code> properties or methods on your job class:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
use App\Product;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeUnique;
 
class UpdateSearchIndex implements ShouldQueue, ShouldBeUnique
{
    /**
     * The product instance.
     *
     * @var \App\Product
     */
    public $product;
 
    /**
     * The number of seconds after which the job's unique lock will be released.
     *
     * @var int
     */
    public $uniqueFor = 3600;
 
    /**
     * The unique ID of the job.
     */
    public function uniqueId(): string
    {
        return $this-&gt;product-&gt;id;
    }
}</pre> <p>In the example above, the <code>UpdateSearchIndex</code> job is unique by a product ID. So, any new dispatches of the job with the same product ID will be ignored until the existing job has completed processing. In addition, if the existing job is not processed within one hour, the unique lock will be released and another job with the same unique key can be dispatched to the queue.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> If your application dispatches jobs from multiple web servers or containers, you should ensure that all of your servers are communicating with the same central cache server so that Laravel can accurately determine if a job is unique.</p> </blockquote>  <h4 id="keeping-jobs-unique-until-processing-begins">Keeping Jobs Unique Until Processing Begins</h4> <p>By default, unique jobs are "unlocked" after a job completes processing or fails all of its retry attempts. However, there may be situations where you would like your job to unlock immediately before it is processed. To accomplish this, your job should implement the <code>ShouldBeUniqueUntilProcessing</code> contract instead of the <code>ShouldBeUnique</code> contract:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
use App\Product;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeUniqueUntilProcessing;
 
class UpdateSearchIndex implements ShouldQueue, ShouldBeUniqueUntilProcessing
{
    // ...
}</pre>  <h4 id="unique-job-locks">Unique Job Locks</h4> <p>Behind the scenes, when a <code>ShouldBeUnique</code> job is dispatched, Laravel attempts to acquire a <a href="cache.html#atomic-locks">lock</a> with the <code>uniqueId</code> key. If the lock is not acquired, the job is not dispatched. This lock is released when the job completes processing or fails all of its retry attempts. By default, Laravel will use the default cache driver to obtain this lock. However, if you wish to use another driver for acquiring the lock, you may define a <code>uniqueVia</code> method that returns the cache driver that should be used:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;
 
class UpdateSearchIndex implements ShouldQueue, ShouldBeUnique
{
    ...
 
    /**
     * Get the cache driver for the unique job lock.
     */
    public function uniqueVia(): Repository
    {
        return Cache::driver('redis');
    }
}</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> If you only need to limit the concurrent processing of a job, use the <a href="queues.html#preventing-job-overlaps"><code>WithoutOverlapping</code></a> job middleware instead.</p> </blockquote>  <h2 id="job-middleware">Job Middleware</h2> <p>Job middleware allow you to wrap custom logic around the execution of queued jobs, reducing boilerplate in the jobs themselves. For example, consider the following <code>handle</code> method which leverages Laravel's Redis rate limiting features to allow only one job to process every five seconds:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis;
 
/**
 * Execute the job.
 */
public function handle(): void
{
    Redis::throttle('key')-&gt;block(0)-&gt;allow(1)-&gt;every(5)-&gt;then(function () {
        info('Lock obtained...');
 
        // Handle job...
    }, function () {
        // Could not obtain lock...
 
        return $this-&gt;release(5);
    });
}</pre> <p>While this code is valid, the implementation of the <code>handle</code> method becomes noisy since it is cluttered with Redis rate limiting logic. In addition, this rate limiting logic must be duplicated for any other jobs that we want to rate limit.</p> <p>Instead of rate limiting in the handle method, we could define a job middleware that handles rate limiting. Laravel does not have a default location for job middleware, so you are welcome to place job middleware anywhere in your application. In this example, we will place the middleware in an <code>app/Jobs/Middleware</code> directory:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Jobs\Middleware;
 
use Closure;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis;
 
class RateLimited
{
    /**
     * Process the queued job.
     *
     * @param  \Closure(object): void  $next
     */
    public function handle(object $job, Closure $next): void
    {
        Redis::throttle('key')
                -&gt;block(0)-&gt;allow(1)-&gt;every(5)
                -&gt;then(function () use ($job, $next) {
                    // Lock obtained...
 
                    $next($job);
                }, function () use ($job) {
                    // Could not obtain lock...
 
                    $job-&gt;release(5);
                });
    }
}</pre> <p>As you can see, like <a href="middleware.html">route middleware</a>, job middleware receive the job being processed and a callback that should be invoked to continue processing the job.</p> <p>After creating job middleware, they may be attached to a job by returning them from the job's <code>middleware</code> method.

Like <a href="routing.html#defining-rate-limiters">route rate limiters</a>, job rate limiters are defined using the <code>RateLimiter</code> facade's <code>for</code> method.</p> <p>For example, you may wish to allow users to backup their data once per hour while imposing no such limit on premium customers.

Each time the job exceeds the rate limit, this middleware will release the job back to the queue with an appropriate delay based on the rate limit duration.</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\RateLimited;

However, you can instruct Laravel to apply the key across job classes using the <code>shared</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\WithoutOverlapping;
 
class ProviderIsDown
{
    // ...
 
 
    public function middleware(): array
    {
        return [
            (new WithoutOverlapping("status:{$this-&gt;provider}"))-&gt;shared(),
        ];
    }
}
 
class ProviderIsUp
{
    // ...
 
 
    public function middleware(): array
    {
        return [
            (new WithoutOverlapping("status:{$this-&gt;provider}"))-&gt;shared(),
        ];
    }
}</pre>  <h3 id="throttling-exceptions">Throttling Exceptions</h3> <p>Laravel includes a <code>Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\ThrottlesExceptions</code> middleware that allows you to throttle exceptions. Once the job throws a given number of exceptions, all further attempts to execute the job are delayed until a specified time interval lapses. This middleware is particularly useful for jobs that interact with third-party services that are unstable.</p> <p>For example, let's imagine a queued job that interacts with a third-party API that begins throwing exceptions. To throttle exceptions, you can return the <code>ThrottlesExceptions</code> middleware from your job's <code>middleware</code> method. Typically, this middleware should be paired with a job that implements <a href="#time-based-attempts">time based attempts</a>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use DateTime;
use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\ThrottlesExceptions;
 
/**
 * Get the middleware the job should pass through.
 *
 * @return array&lt;int, object&gt;
 */
public function middleware(): array
{
    return [new ThrottlesExceptions(10, 5)];
}
 
/**
 * Determine the time at which the job should timeout.
 */
public function retryUntil(): DateTime
{
    return now()-&gt;addMinutes(5);
}</pre> <p>The first constructor argument accepted by the middleware is the number of exceptions the job can throw before being throttled, while the second constructor argument is the number of minutes that should elapse before the job is attempted again once it has been throttled. In the code example above, if the job throws 10 exceptions within 5 minutes, we will wait 5 minutes before attempting the job again.</p> <p>When a job throws an exception but the exception threshold has not yet been reached, the job will typically be retried immediately. However, you may specify the number of minutes such a job should be delayed by calling the <code>backoff</code> method when attaching the middleware to the job:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\ThrottlesExceptions;
 
/**
 * Get the middleware the job should pass through.
 *
 * @return array&lt;int, object&gt;
 */
public function middleware(): array
{
    return [(new ThrottlesExceptions(10, 5))-&gt;backoff(5)];
}</pre> <p>Internally, this middleware uses Laravel's cache system to implement rate limiting, and the job's class name is utilized as the cache "key". You may override this key by calling the <code>by</code> method when attaching the middleware to your job. This may be useful if you have multiple jobs interacting with the same third-party service and you would like them to share a common throttling "bucket":</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\ThrottlesExceptions;
 
/**
 * Get the middleware the job should pass through.
 *
 * @return array&lt;int, object&gt;
 */
public function middleware(): array
{
    return [(new ThrottlesExceptions(10, 10))-&gt;by('key')];
}</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> If you are using Redis, you may use the <code>Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\ThrottlesExceptionsWithRedis</code> middleware, which is fine-tuned for Redis and more efficient than the basic exception throttling middleware.</p> </blockquote>  <h2 id="dispatching-jobs">Dispatching Jobs</h2> <p>Once you have written your job class, you may dispatch it using the <code>dispatch</code> method on the job itself. The arguments passed to the <code>dispatch</code> method will be given to the job's constructor:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

ProcessPodcast::dispatchUnless($accountSuspended, $podcast);</pre> <p>In new Laravel applications, the <code>sync</code> driver is the default queue driver. This driver executes jobs synchronously in the foreground of the current request, which is often convenient during local development. If you would like to actually begin queueing jobs for background processing, you may specify a different queue driver within your application's <code>config/queue.php</code> configuration file.</p>  <h3 id="delayed-dispatching">Delayed Dispatching</h3> <p>If you would like to specify that a job should not be immediately available for processing by a queue worker, you may use the <code>delay</code> method when dispatching the job. For example, let's specify that a job should not be available for processing until 10 minutes after it has been dispatched:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

This will still allow the user to begin using the application even though a queued job is still executing. This should typically only be used for jobs that take about a second, such as sending an email. Since they are processed within the current HTTP request, jobs dispatched in this fashion do not require a queue worker to be running in order for them to be processed:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\SendNotification;
 
SendNotification::dispatchAfterResponse();</pre> <p>You may also <code>dispatch</code> a closure and chain the <code>afterResponse</code> method onto the <code>dispatch</code> helper to execute a closure after the HTTP response has been sent to the browser:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Mail\WelcomeMessage;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
 
dispatch(function () {
    Mail::to('taylor@example.com')-&gt;send(new WelcomeMessage);
})-&gt;afterResponse();</pre>  <h3 id="synchronous-dispatching">Synchronous Dispatching</h3> <p>If you would like to dispatch a job immediately (synchronously), you may use the <code>dispatchSync</code> method. When using this method, the job will not be queued and will be executed immediately within the current process:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

        return redirect('/podcasts');
    }
}</pre>  <h3 id="jobs-and-database-transactions">Jobs &amp; Database Transactions</h3> <p>While it is perfectly fine to dispatch jobs within database transactions, you should take special care to ensure that your job will actually be able to execute successfully. When dispatching a job within a transaction, it is possible that the job will be processed by a worker before the parent transaction has committed. When this happens, any updates you have made to models or database records during the database transaction(s) may not yet be reflected in the database. In addition, any models or database records created within the transaction(s) may not exist in the database.</p> <p>Thankfully, Laravel provides several methods of working around this problem. First, you may set the <code>after_commit</code> connection option in your queue connection's configuration array:</p> <pre data-language="php">'redis' =&gt; [
    'driver' =&gt; 'redis',
    // ...
    'after_commit' =&gt; true,
],</pre> <p>When the <code>after_commit</code> option is <code>true</code>, you may dispatch jobs within database transactions; however, Laravel will wait until the open parent database transactions have been committed before actually dispatching the job. Of course, if no database transactions are currently open, the job will be dispatched immediately.</p> <p>If a transaction is rolled back due to an exception that occurs during the transaction, the jobs that were dispatched during that transaction will be discarded.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> Setting the <code>after_commit</code> configuration option to <code>true</code> will also cause any queued event listeners, mailables, notifications, and broadcast events to be dispatched after all open database transactions have been committed.</p> </blockquote>  <h4 id="specifying-commit-dispatch-behavior-inline">Specifying Commit Dispatch Behavior Inline</h4> <p>If you do not set the <code>after_commit</code> queue connection configuration option to <code>true</code>, you may still indicate that a specific job should be dispatched after all open database transactions have been committed. To accomplish this, you may chain the <code>afterCommit</code> method onto your dispatch operation:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast;
 
ProcessPodcast::dispatch($podcast)-&gt;afterCommit();</pre> <p>Likewise, if the <code>after_commit</code> configuration option is set to <code>true</code>, you may indicate that a specific job should be dispatched immediately without waiting for any open database transactions to commit:</p> <pre data-language="php">ProcessPodcast::dispatch($podcast)-&gt;beforeCommit();</pre>  <h3 id="job-chaining">Job Chaining</h3> <p>Job chaining allows you to specify a list of queued jobs that should be run in sequence after the primary job has executed successfully. If one job in the sequence fails, the rest of the jobs will not be run. To execute a queued job chain, you may use the <code>chain</code> method provided by the <code>Bus</code> facade. Laravel's command bus is a lower level component that queued job dispatching is built on top of:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\OptimizePodcast;
use App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast;
use App\Jobs\ReleasePodcast;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;
 
Bus::chain([
    new ProcessPodcast,
    new OptimizePodcast,
    new ReleasePodcast,
])-&gt;dispatch();</pre> <p>In addition to chaining job class instances, you may also chain closures:</p> <pre data-language="php">Bus::chain([
    new ProcessPodcast,
    new OptimizePodcast,
    function () {
        Podcast::update(/* ... */);
    },
])-&gt;dispatch();</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> Deleting jobs using the <code>$this-&gt;delete()</code> method within the job will not prevent chained jobs from being processed. The chain will only stop executing if a job in the chain fails.</p> </blockquote>  <h4 id="chain-connection-queue">Chain Connection &amp; Queue</h4> <p>If you would like to specify the connection and queue that should be used for the chained jobs, you may use the <code>onConnection</code> and <code>onQueue</code> methods. These methods specify the queue connection and queue name that should be used unless the queued job is explicitly assigned a different connection / queue:</p> <pre data-language="php">Bus::chain([
    new ProcessPodcast,
    new OptimizePodcast,
    new ReleasePodcast,
])-&gt;onConnection('redis')-&gt;onQueue('podcasts')-&gt;dispatch();</pre>  <h4 id="chain-failures">Chain Failures</h4> <p>When chaining jobs, you may use the <code>catch</code> method to specify a closure that should be invoked if a job within the chain fails. The given callback will receive the <code>Throwable</code> instance that caused the job failure:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;
use Throwable;
 
Bus::chain([
    new ProcessPodcast,

])-&gt;catch(function (Throwable $e) {
    // A job within the chain has failed...
})-&gt;dispatch();</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> Since chain callbacks are serialized and executed at a later time by the Laravel queue, you should not use the <code>$this</code> variable within chain callbacks.</p> </blockquote>  <h3 id="customizing-the-queue-and-connection">Customizing The Queue &amp; Connection</h3>  <h4 id="dispatching-to-a-particular-queue">Dispatching To A Particular Queue</h4> <p>By pushing jobs to different queues, you may "categorize" your queued jobs and even prioritize how many workers you assign to various queues. Keep in mind, this does not push jobs to different queue "connections" as defined by your queue configuration file, but only to specific queues within a single connection. To specify the queue, use the <code>onQueue</code> method when dispatching the job:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

This will apply to all jobs processed by the worker unless the job being processed specifies the number of times it may be attempted:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --tries=3</pre> <p>If a job exceeds its maximum number of attempts, it will be considered a "failed" job.

For this reason, Laravel allows you to specify a "timeout" value. By default, the timeout value is 60 seconds. If a job is processing for longer than the number of seconds specified by the timeout value, the worker processing the job will exit with an error. Typically, the worker will be restarted automatically by a <a href="#supervisor-configuration">process manager configured on your server</a>.</p> <p>The maximum number of seconds that jobs can run may be specified using the <code>--timeout</code> switch on the Artisan command line:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --timeout=30</pre> <p>If the job exceeds its maximum attempts by continually timing out, it will be marked as failed.</p> <p>You may also define the maximum number of seconds a job should be allowed to run on the job class itself.

    // All jobs completed successfully...
})-&gt;name('Import CSV')-&gt;dispatch();</pre>  <h4 id="batch-connection-queue">Batch Connection &amp; Queue</h4> <p>If you would like to specify the connection and queue that should be used for the batched jobs, you may use the <code>onConnection</code> and <code>onQueue</code> methods. All batched jobs must execute within the same connection and queue:</p> <pre data-language="php">$batch = Bus::batch([

This pattern can be useful when you need to batch thousands of jobs which may take too long to dispatch during a web request. So, instead, you may wish to dispatch an initial batch of "loader" jobs that hydrate the batch with even more jobs:</p> <pre data-language="php">$batch = Bus::batch([

This makes it convenient to display information about the batch's completion progress in your application's UI.</p> <p>To retrieve a batch by its ID, you may use the <code>Bus</code> facade's <code>findBatch</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;

    }
 
    if ($this-&gt;batch()-&gt;cancelled()) {
        return;
    }
}</pre> <p>As you may have noticed in the previous examples, batched jobs should typically determine if their corresponding batch has been cancelled before continuing execution. However, for convenience, you may assign the <code>SkipIfBatchCancelled</code> <a href="#job-middleware">middleware</a> to the job instead. As its name indicates, this middleware will instruct Laravel to not process the job if its corresponding batch has been cancelled:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\SkipIfBatchCancelled;

public function middleware(): array

This callback is only invoked for the first job that fails within the batch.</p>  <h4 id="allowing-failures">Allowing Failures</h4> <p>When a job within a batch fails, Laravel will automatically mark the batch as "cancelled". If you wish, you may disable this behavior so that a job failure does not automatically mark the batch as cancelled. This may be accomplished by calling the <code>allowFailures</code> method while dispatching the batch:</p> <pre data-language="php">$batch = Bus::batch([

})-&gt;allowFailures()-&gt;dispatch();</pre>  <h4 id="retrying-failed-batch-jobs">Retrying Failed Batch Jobs</h4> <p>For convenience, Laravel provides a <code>queue:retry-batch</code> Artisan command that allows you to easily retry all of the failed jobs for a given batch. The <code>queue:retry-batch</code> command accepts the UUID of the batch whose failed jobs should be retried:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:retry-batch 32dbc76c-4f82-4749-b610-a639fe0099b5</pre>  <h3 id="pruning-batches">Pruning Batches</h3> <p>Without pruning, the <code>job_batches</code> table can accumulate records very quickly. To mitigate this, you should <a href="scheduling.html">schedule</a> the <code>queue:prune-batches</code> Artisan command to run daily:</p> <pre data-language="php">$schedule-&gt;command('queue:prune-batches')-&gt;daily();</pre> <p>By default, all finished batches that are more than 24 hours old will be pruned. You may use the <code>hours</code> option when calling the command to determine how long to retain batch data. For example, the following command will delete all batches that finished over 48 hours ago:</p> <pre data-language="php">$schedule-&gt;command('queue:prune-batches --hours=48')-&gt;daily();</pre> <p>Sometimes, your <code>jobs_batches</code> table may accumulate batch records for batches that never completed successfully, such as batches where a job failed and that job was never retried successfully. You may instruct the <code>queue:prune-batches</code> command to prune these unfinished batch records using the <code>unfinished</code> option:</p> <pre data-language="php">$schedule-&gt;command('queue:prune-batches --hours=48 --unfinished=72')-&gt;daily();</pre> <p>Likewise, your <code>jobs_batches</code> table may also accumulate batch records for cancelled batches. You may instruct the <code>queue:prune-batches</code> command to prune these cancelled batch records using the <code>cancelled</code> option:</p> <pre data-language="php">$schedule-&gt;command('queue:prune-batches --hours=48 --cancelled=72')-&gt;daily();</pre>  <h2 id="queueing-closures">Queueing Closures</h2> <p>Instead of dispatching a job class to the queue, you may also dispatch a closure. This is great for quick, simple tasks that need to be executed outside of the current request cycle. When dispatching closures to the queue, the closure's code content is cryptographically signed so that it can not be modified in transit:</p> <pre data-language="php">$podcast = App\Podcast::find(1);
 
dispatch(function () use ($podcast) {
    $podcast-&gt;publish();
});</pre> <p>Using the <code>catch</code> method, you may provide a closure that should be executed if the queued closure fails to complete successfully after exhausting all of your queue's <a href="#max-job-attempts-and-timeout">configured retry attempts</a>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Throwable;
 
dispatch(function () use ($podcast) {
    $podcast-&gt;publish();

    // This job has failed...
});</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> Since <code>catch</code> callbacks are serialized and executed at a later time by the Laravel queue, you should not use the <code>$this</code> variable within <code>catch</code> callbacks.</p> </blockquote>  <h2 id="running-the-queue-worker">Running The Queue Worker</h2>  <h3 id="the-queue-work-command">The <code>queue:work</code> Command</h3> <p>Laravel includes an Artisan command that will start a queue worker and process new jobs as they are pushed onto the queue. You may run the worker using the <code>queue:work</code> Artisan command. Note that once the <code>queue:work</code> command has started, it will continue to run until it is manually stopped or you close your terminal:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> To keep the <code>queue:work</code> process running permanently in the background, you should use a process monitor such as <a href="#supervisor-configuration">Supervisor</a> to ensure that the queue worker does not stop running.</p> </blockquote> <p>You may include the <code>-v</code> flag when invoking the <code>queue:work</code> command if you would like the processed job IDs to be included in the command's output:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work -v</pre> <p>Remember, queue workers are long-lived processes and store the booted application state in memory. As a result, they will not notice changes in your code base after they have been started. So, during your deployment process, be sure to <a href="#queue-workers-and-deployment">restart your queue workers</a>. In addition, remember that any static state created or modified by your application will not be automatically reset between jobs.</p> <p>Alternatively, you may run the <code>queue:listen</code> command. When using the <code>queue:listen</code> command, you don't have to manually restart the worker when you want to reload your updated code or reset the application state; however, this command is significantly less efficient than the <code>queue:work</code> command:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:listen</pre>  <h4 id="running-multiple-queue-workers">Running Multiple Queue Workers</h4> <p>To assign multiple workers to a queue and process jobs concurrently, you should simply start multiple <code>queue:work</code> processes. This can either be done locally via multiple tabs in your terminal or in production using your process manager's configuration settings. <a href="#supervisor-configuration">When using Supervisor</a>, you may use the <code>numprocs</code> configuration value.</p>  <h4 id="specifying-the-connection-queue">Specifying The Connection &amp; Queue</h4> <p>You may also specify which queue connection the worker should utilize. The connection name passed to the <code>work</code> command should correspond to one of the connections defined in your <code>config/queue.php</code> configuration file:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work redis</pre> <p>By default, the <code>queue:work</code> command only processes jobs for the default queue on a given connection. However, you may customize your queue worker even further by only processing particular queues for a given connection. For example, if all of your emails are processed in an <code>emails</code> queue on your <code>redis</code> queue connection, you may issue the following command to start a worker that only processes that queue:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work redis --queue=emails</pre>  <h4 id="processing-a-specified-number-of-jobs">Processing A Specified Number Of Jobs</h4> <p>The <code>--once</code> option may be used to instruct the worker to only process a single job from the queue:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --once</pre> <p>The <code>--max-jobs</code> option may be used to instruct the worker to process the given number of jobs and then exit. This option may be useful when combined with <a href="#supervisor-configuration">Supervisor</a> so that your workers are automatically restarted after processing a given number of jobs, releasing any memory they may have accumulated:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --max-jobs=1000</pre>  <h4 id="processing-all-queued-jobs-then-exiting">Processing All Queued Jobs &amp; Then Exiting</h4> <p>The <code>--stop-when-empty</code> option may be used to instruct the worker to process all jobs and then exit gracefully. This option can be useful when processing Laravel queues within a Docker container if you wish to shutdown the container after the queue is empty:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --stop-when-empty</pre>  <h4 id="processing-jobs-for-a-given-number-of-seconds">Processing Jobs For A Given Number Of Seconds</h4> <p>The <code>--max-time</code> option may be used to instruct the worker to process jobs for the given number of seconds and then exit. This option may be useful when combined with <a href="#supervisor-configuration">Supervisor</a> so that your workers are automatically restarted after processing jobs for a given amount of time, releasing any memory they may have accumulated:</p> <pre data-language="shell"># Process jobs for one hour and then exit...
php artisan queue:work --max-time=3600</pre>  <h4 id="worker-sleep-duration">Worker Sleep Duration</h4> <p>When jobs are available on the queue, the worker will keep processing jobs with no delay in between jobs. However, the <code>sleep</code> option determines how many seconds the worker will "sleep" if there are no jobs available. Of course, while sleeping, the worker will not process any new jobs:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --sleep=3</pre>  <h4 id="resource-considerations">Resource Considerations</h4> <p>Daemon queue workers do not "reboot" the framework before processing each job. Therefore, you should release any heavy resources after each job completes. For example, if you are doing image manipulation with the GD library, you should free the memory with <code>imagedestroy</code> when you are done processing the image.</p>  <h3 id="queue-priorities">Queue Priorities</h3> <p>Sometimes you may wish to prioritize how your queues are processed. For example, in your <code>config/queue.php</code> configuration file, you may set the default <code>queue</code> for your <code>redis</code> connection to <code>low</code>. However, occasionally you may wish to push a job to a <code>high</code> priority queue like so:</p> <pre data-language="php">dispatch((new Job)-&gt;onQueue('high'));</pre> <p>To start a worker that verifies that all of the <code>high</code> queue jobs are processed before continuing to any jobs on the <code>low</code> queue, pass a comma-delimited list of queue names to the <code>work</code> command:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --queue=high,low</pre>  <h3 id="queue-workers-and-deployment">Queue Workers &amp; Deployment</h3> <p>Since queue workers are long-lived processes, they will not notice changes to your code without being restarted. So, the simplest way to deploy an application using queue workers is to restart the workers during your deployment process. You may gracefully restart all of the workers by issuing the <code>queue:restart</code> command:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:restart</pre> <p>This command will instruct all queue workers to gracefully exit after they finish processing their current job so that no existing jobs are lost. Since the queue workers will exit when the <code>queue:restart</code> command is executed, you should be running a process manager such as <a href="#supervisor-configuration">Supervisor</a> to automatically restart the queue workers.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> The queue uses the <a href="cache.html">cache</a> to store restart signals, so you should verify that a cache driver is properly configured for your application before using this feature.</p> </blockquote>  <h3 id="job-expirations-and-timeouts">Job Expirations &amp; Timeouts</h3>  <h4 id="job-expiration">Job Expiration</h4> <p>In your <code>config/queue.php</code> configuration file, each queue connection defines a <code>retry_after</code> option. This option specifies how many seconds the queue connection should wait before retrying a job that is being processed. For example, if the value of <code>retry_after</code> is set to <code>90</code>, the job will be released back onto the queue if it has been processing for 90 seconds without being released or deleted. Typically, you should set the <code>retry_after</code> value to the maximum number of seconds your jobs should reasonably take to complete processing.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> The only queue connection which does not contain a <code>retry_after</code> value is Amazon SQS. SQS will retry the job based on the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html">Default Visibility Timeout</a> which is managed within the AWS console.</p> </blockquote>  <h4 id="worker-timeouts">Worker Timeouts</h4> <p>The <code>queue:work</code> Artisan command exposes a <code>--timeout</code> option. By default, the <code>--timeout</code> value is 60 seconds. If a job is processing for longer than the number of seconds specified by the timeout value, the worker processing the job will exit with an error. Typically, the worker will be restarted automatically by a <a href="#supervisor-configuration">process manager configured on your server</a>:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --timeout=60</pre> <p>The <code>retry_after</code> configuration option and the <code>--timeout</code> CLI option are different, but work together to ensure that jobs are not lost and that jobs are only successfully processed once.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> The <code>--timeout</code> value should always be at least several seconds shorter than your <code>retry_after</code> configuration value. This will ensure that a worker processing a frozen job is always terminated before the job is retried. If your <code>--timeout</code> option is longer than your <code>retry_after</code> configuration value, your jobs may be processed twice.</p> </blockquote>  <h2 id="supervisor-configuration">Supervisor Configuration</h2> <p>In production, you need a way to keep your <code>queue:work</code> processes running. A <code>queue:work</code> process may stop running for a variety of reasons, such as an exceeded worker timeout or the execution of the <code>queue:restart</code> command.</p> <p>For this reason, you need to configure a process monitor that can detect when your <code>queue:work</code> processes exit and automatically restart them. In addition, process monitors can allow you to specify how many <code>queue:work</code> processes you would like to run concurrently. Supervisor is a process monitor commonly used in Linux environments and we will discuss how to configure it in the following documentation.</p>  <h4 id="installing-supervisor">Installing Supervisor</h4> <p>Supervisor is a process monitor for the Linux operating system, and will automatically restart your <code>queue:work</code> processes if they fail. To install Supervisor on Ubuntu, you may use the following command:</p> <pre data-language="shell">sudo apt-get install supervisor</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> If configuring and managing Supervisor yourself sounds overwhelming, consider using <a href="https://forge.laravel.com">Laravel Forge</a>, which will automatically install and configure Supervisor for your production Laravel projects.</p> </blockquote>  <h4 id="configuring-supervisor">Configuring Supervisor</h4> <p>Supervisor configuration files are typically stored in the <code>/etc/supervisor/conf.d</code> directory. Within this directory, you may create any number of configuration files that instruct supervisor how your processes should be monitored. For example, let's create a <code>laravel-worker.conf</code> file that starts and monitors <code>queue:work</code> processes:</p> <pre data-language="ini">[program:laravel-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /home/forge/app.com/artisan queue:work sqs --sleep=3 --tries=3 --max-time=3600
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
user=forge
numprocs=8
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/home/forge/app.com/worker.log
stopwaitsecs=3600</pre> <p>In this example, the <code>numprocs</code> directive will instruct Supervisor to run eight <code>queue:work</code> processes and monitor all of them, automatically restarting them if they fail. You should change the <code>command</code> directive of the configuration to reflect your desired queue connection and worker options.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> You should ensure that the value of <code>stopwaitsecs</code> is greater than the number of seconds consumed by your longest running job. Otherwise, Supervisor may kill the job before it is finished processing.</p> </blockquote>  <h4 id="starting-supervisor">Starting Supervisor</h4> <p>Once the configuration file has been created, you may update the Supervisor configuration and start the processes using the following commands:</p> <pre data-language="shell">sudo supervisorctl reread
 
sudo supervisorctl update
 
sudo supervisorctl start laravel-worker:*</pre> <p>For more information on Supervisor, consult the <a href="http://supervisord.org/index.html">Supervisor documentation</a>.</p>  <h2 id="dealing-with-failed-jobs">Dealing With Failed Jobs</h2> <p>Sometimes your queued jobs will fail. Don't worry, things don't always go as planned! Laravel includes a convenient way to <a href="#max-job-attempts-and-timeout">specify the maximum number of times a job should be attempted</a>. After an asynchronous job has exceeded this number of attempts, it will be inserted into the <code>failed_jobs</code> database table. <a href="queues.html#synchronous-dispatching">Synchronously dispatched jobs</a> that fail are not stored in this table and their exceptions are immediately handled by the application.</p> <p>A migration to create the <code>failed_jobs</code> table is typically already present in new Laravel applications. However, if your application does not contain a migration for this table, you may use the <code>queue:failed-table</code> command to create the migration:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:failed-table
 
php artisan migrate</pre> <p>When running a <a href="#running-the-queue-worker">queue worker</a> process, you may specify the maximum number of times a job should be attempted using the <code>--tries</code> switch on the <code>queue:work</code> command. If you do not specify a value for the <code>--tries</code> option, jobs will only be attempted once or as many times as specified by the job class' <code>$tries</code> property:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work redis --tries=3</pre> <p>Using the <code>--backoff</code> option, you may specify how many seconds Laravel should wait before retrying a job that has encountered an exception. By default, a job is immediately released back onto the queue so that it may be attempted again:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work redis --tries=3 --backoff=3</pre> <p>If you would like to configure how many seconds Laravel should wait before retrying a job that has encountered an exception on a per-job basis, you may do so by defining a <code>backoff</code> property on your job class:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * The number of seconds to wait before retrying the job.
 *
 * @var int
 */
public $backoff = 3;</pre> <p>If you require more complex logic for determining the job's backoff time, you may define a <code>backoff</code> method on your job class:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
* Calculate the number of seconds to wait before retrying the job.
*/
public function backoff(): int
{
    return 3;
}</pre> <p>You may easily configure "exponential" backoffs by returning an array of backoff values from the <code>backoff</code> method. In this example, the retry delay will be 1 second for the first retry, 5 seconds for the second retry, and 10 seconds for the third retry:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
* Calculate the number of seconds to wait before retrying the job.
*
* @return array&lt;int, int&gt;

public function backoff(): array
{
    return [1, 5, 10];
}</pre>  <h3 id="cleaning-up-after-failed-jobs">Cleaning Up After Failed Jobs</h3> <p>When a particular job fails, you may want to send an alert to your users or revert any actions that were partially completed by the job.

However, if the model has been deleted while the job was waiting to be processed by a worker, your job may fail with a <code>ModelNotFoundException</code>.</p> <p>For convenience, you may choose to automatically delete jobs with missing models by setting your job's <code>deleteWhenMissingModels</code> property to <code>true</code>. When this property is set to <code>true</code>, Laravel will quietly discard the job without raising an exception:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Delete the job if its models no longer exist.
 *
 * @var bool
 */
public $deleteWhenMissingModels = true;</pre>  <h3 id="pruning-failed-jobs">Pruning Failed Jobs</h3> <p>You may prune the records in your application's <code>failed_jobs</code> table by invoking the <code>queue:prune-failed</code> Artisan command:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:prune-failed</pre> <p>By default, all the failed job records that are more than 24 hours old will be pruned. If you provide the <code>--hours</code> option to the command, only the failed job records that were inserted within the last N number of hours will be retained. For example, the following command will delete all the failed job records that were inserted more than 48 hours ago:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:prune-failed --hours=48</pre>  <h3 id="storing-failed-jobs-in-dynamodb">Storing Failed Jobs In DynamoDB</h3> <p>Laravel also provides support for storing your failed job records in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb">DynamoDB</a> instead of a relational database table. However, you must create a DynamoDB table to store all of the failed job records. Typically, this table should be named <code>failed_jobs</code>, but you should name the table based on the value of the <code>queue.failed.table</code> configuration value within your application's <code>queue</code> configuration file.</p> <p>The <code>failed_jobs</code> table should have a string primary partition key named <code>application</code> and a string primary sort key named <code>uuid</code>. The <code>application</code> portion of the key will contain your application's name as defined by the <code>name</code> configuration value within your application's <code>app</code> configuration file. Since the application name is part of the DynamoDB table's key, you can use the same table to store failed jobs for multiple Laravel applications.</p> <p>In addition, ensure that you install the AWS SDK so that your Laravel application can communicate with Amazon DynamoDB:</p> <pre data-language="shell">composer require aws/aws-sdk-php</pre> <p>Next, set the <code>queue.failed.driver</code> configuration option's value to <code>dynamodb</code>. In addition, you should define <code>key</code>, <code>secret</code>, and <code>region</code> configuration options within the failed job configuration array. These options will be used to authenticate with AWS. When using the <code>dynamodb</code> driver, the <code>queue.failed.database</code> configuration option is unnecessary:</p> <pre data-language="php">'failed' =&gt; [
    'driver' =&gt; env('QUEUE_FAILED_DRIVER', 'dynamodb'),
    'key' =&gt; env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
    'secret' =&gt; env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
    'region' =&gt; env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION', 'us-east-1'),
    'table' =&gt; 'failed_jobs',
],</pre>  <h3 id="disabling-failed-job-storage">Disabling Failed Job Storage</h3> <p>You may instruct Laravel to discard failed jobs without storing them by setting the <code>queue.failed.driver</code> configuration option's value to <code>null</code>. Typically, this may be accomplished via the <code>QUEUE_FAILED_DRIVER</code> environment variable:</p> <pre data-language="ini">QUEUE_FAILED_DRIVER=null</pre>  <h3 id="failed-job-events">Failed Job Events</h3> <p>If you would like to register an event listener that will be invoked when a job fails, you may use the <code>Queue</code> facade's <code>failing</code> method. For example, we may attach a closure to this event from the <code>boot</code> method of the <code>AppServiceProvider</code> that is included with Laravel:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Providers;
 
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Queue;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Queue\Events\JobFailed;
 
class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        // ...
    }
 
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Queue::failing(function (JobFailed $event) {
            // $event-&gt;connectionName
            // $event-&gt;job
            // $event-&gt;exception
        });
    }
}</pre>  <h2 id="clearing-jobs-from-queues">Clearing Jobs From Queues</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> When using <a href="horizon.html">Horizon</a>, you should use the <code>horizon:clear</code> command to clear jobs from the queue instead of the <code>queue:clear</code> command.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you would like to delete all jobs from the default queue of the default connection, you may do so using the <code>queue:clear</code> Artisan command:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:clear</pre> <p>You may also provide the <code>connection</code> argument and <code>queue</code> option to delete jobs from a specific connection and queue:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:clear redis --queue=emails</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> Clearing jobs from queues is only available for the SQS, Redis, and database queue drivers. In addition, the SQS message deletion process takes up to 60 seconds, so jobs sent to the SQS queue up to 60 seconds after you clear the queue might also be deleted.</p> </blockquote>  <h2 id="monitoring-your-queues">Monitoring Your Queues</h2> <p>If your queue receives a sudden influx of jobs, it could become overwhelmed, leading to a long wait time for jobs to complete. If you wish, Laravel can alert you when your queue job count exceeds a specified threshold.</p> <p>To get started, you should schedule the <code>queue:monitor</code> command to <a href="scheduling.html">run every minute</a>. The command accepts the names of the queues you wish to monitor as well as your desired job count threshold:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:monitor redis:default,redis:deployments --max=100</pre> <p>Scheduling this command alone is not enough to trigger a notification alerting you of the queue's overwhelmed status. When the command encounters a queue that has a job count exceeding your threshold, an <code>Illuminate\Queue\Events\QueueBusy</code> event will be dispatched. You may listen for this event within your application's <code>EventServiceProvider</code> in order to send a notification to you or your development team:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Notifications\QueueHasLongWaitTime;
use Illuminate\Queue\Events\QueueBusy;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Notification;
 
/**
 * Register any other events for your application.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Event::listen(function (QueueBusy $event) {
        Notification::route('mail', 'dev@example.com')
                -&gt;notify(new QueueHasLongWaitTime(
                    $event-&gt;connection,
                    $event-&gt;queue,
                    $event-&gt;size
                ));
    });
}</pre>  <h2 id="testing">Testing</h2> <p>When testing code that dispatches jobs, you may wish to instruct Laravel to not actually execute the job itself, since the job's code can be tested directly and separately of the code that dispatches it. Of course, to test the job itself, you may instantiate a job instance and invoke the <code>handle</code> method directly in your test.</p> <p>You may use the <code>Queue</code> facade's <code>fake</code> method to prevent queued jobs from actually being pushed to the queue. After calling the <code>Queue</code> facade's <code>fake</code> method, you may then assert that the application attempted to push jobs to the queue:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace Tests\Feature;
 
use App\Jobs\AnotherJob;
use App\Jobs\FinalJob;
use App\Jobs\ShipOrder;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Queue;
use Tests\TestCase;
 
class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_orders_can_be_shipped(): void
    {
        Queue::fake();
 
        // Perform order shipping...
 
        // Assert that no jobs were pushed...
        Queue::assertNothingPushed();
 
        // Assert a job was pushed to a given queue...
        Queue::assertPushedOn('queue-name', ShipOrder::class);
 
        // Assert a job was pushed twice...
        Queue::assertPushed(ShipOrder::class, 2);
 
        // Assert a job was not pushed...
        Queue::assertNotPushed(AnotherJob::class);
 
        // Assert that a Closure was pushed to the queue...
        Queue::assertClosurePushed();
    }
}</pre> <p>You may pass a closure to the <code>assertPushed</code> or <code>assertNotPushed</code> methods in order to assert that a job was pushed that passes a given "truth test". If at least one job was pushed that passes the given truth test then the assertion will be successful:</p> <pre data-language="php">Queue::assertPushed(function (ShipOrder $job) use ($order) {
    return $job-&gt;order-&gt;id === $order-&gt;id;
});</pre>  <h3 id="faking-a-subset-of-jobs">Faking A Subset Of Jobs</h3> <p>If you only need to fake specific jobs while allowing your other jobs to execute normally, you may pass the class names of the jobs that should be faked to the <code>fake</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">public function test_orders_can_be_shipped(): void
{
    Queue::fake([
        ShipOrder::class,
    ]);
 
    // Perform order shipping...
 
    // Assert a job was pushed twice...
    Queue::assertPushed(ShipOrder::class, 2);
}</pre> <p>You may fake all jobs except for a set of specified jobs using the <code>except</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">Queue::fake()-&gt;except([
    ShipOrder::class,
]);</pre>  <h3 id="testing-job-chains">Testing Job Chains</h3> <p>To test job chains, you will need to utilize the <code>Bus</code> facade's faking capabilities. The <code>Bus</code> facade's <code>assertChained</code> method may be used to assert that a <a href="queues.html#job-chaining">chain of jobs</a> was dispatched. The <code>assertChained</code> method accepts an array of chained jobs as its first argument:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\RecordShipment;
use App\Jobs\ShipOrder;
use App\Jobs\UpdateInventory;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;
 
Bus::fake();
 
// ...
 
Bus::assertChained([
    ShipOrder::class,
    RecordShipment::class,
    UpdateInventory::class
]);</pre> <p>As you can see in the example above, the array of chained jobs may be an array of the job's class names. However, you may also provide an array of actual job instances. When doing so, Laravel will ensure that the job instances are of the same class and have the same property values of the chained jobs dispatched by your application:</p> <pre data-language="php">Bus::assertChained([
    new ShipOrder,
    new RecordShipment,
    new UpdateInventory,
]);</pre> <p>You may use the <code>assertDispatchedWithoutChain</code> method to assert that a job was pushed without a chain of jobs:</p> <pre data-language="php">Bus::assertDispatchedWithoutChain(ShipOrder::class);</pre>  <h3 id="testing-job-batches">Testing Job Batches</h3> <p>The <code>Bus</code> facade's <code>assertBatched</code> method may be used to assert that a <a href="queues.html#job-batching">batch of jobs</a> was dispatched. The closure given to the <code>assertBatched</code> method receives an instance of <code>Illuminate\Bus\PendingBatch</code>, which may be used to inspect the jobs within the batch:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Bus\PendingBatch;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;
 
Bus::fake();
 
// ...
 
Bus::assertBatched(function (PendingBatch $batch) {
    return $batch-&gt;name == 'import-csv' &amp;&amp;
           $batch-&gt;jobs-&gt;count() === 10;
});</pre>  <h4 id="testing-job-batch-interaction">Testing Job / Batch Interaction</h4> <p>In addition, you may occasionally need to test an individual job's interaction with its underlying batch. For example, you may need to test if a job cancelled further processing for its batch. To accomplish this, you need to assign a fake batch to the job via the <code>withFakeBatch</code> method. The <code>withFakeBatch</code> method returns a tuple containing the job instance and the fake batch:</p> <pre data-language="php">[$job, $batch] = (new ShipOrder)-&gt;withFakeBatch();
 
$job-&gt;handle();
 
$this-&gt;assertTrue($batch-&gt;cancelled());
$this-&gt;assertEmpty($batch-&gt;added);</pre>  <h2 id="job-events">Job Events</h2> <p>Using the <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> methods on the <code>Queue</code> <a href="facades.html">facade</a>, you may specify callbacks to be executed before or after a queued job is processed. These callbacks are a great opportunity to perform additional logging or increment statistics for a dashboard. Typically, you should call these methods from the <code>boot</code> method of a <a href="providers.html">service provider</a>. For example, we may use the <code>AppServiceProvider</code> that is included with Laravel:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Providers;
 
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Queue;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Queue\Events\JobProcessed;
use Illuminate\Queue\Events\JobProcessing;
 
class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        // ...
    }
 
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Queue::before(function (JobProcessing $event) {
            // $event-&gt;connectionName
            // $event-&gt;job
            // $event-&gt;job-&gt;payload()
        });
 
        Queue::after(function (JobProcessed $event) {
            // $event-&gt;connectionName
            // $event-&gt;job
            // $event-&gt;job-&gt;payload()
        });
    }
}</pre> <p>Using the <code>looping</code> method on the <code>Queue</code> <a href="facades.html">facade</a>, you may specify callbacks that execute before the worker attempts to fetch a job from a queue. For example, you might register a closure to rollback any transactions that were left open by a previously failed job:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Queue;
 
Queue::looping(function () {
    while (DB::transactionLevel() &gt; 0) {
        DB::rollBack();
    }
