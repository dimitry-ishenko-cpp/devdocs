In this document, we'll cover some great starting points for making sure your Laravel application is deployed properly.</p>  <h2 id="server-requirements">Server Requirements</h2> <p>The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. You should ensure that your web server has the following minimum PHP version and extensions:</p> <div class="content-list" markdown="1"> <ul> <li>PHP &gt;= 8.1</li> <li>Ctype PHP Extension</li> <li>cURL PHP Extension</li> <li>DOM PHP Extension</li> <li>Fileinfo PHP Extension</li> <li>Filter PHP Extension</li> <li>Hash PHP Extension</li> <li>Mbstring PHP Extension</li> <li>OpenSSL PHP Extension</li> <li>PCRE PHP Extension</li> <li>PDO PHP Extension</li> <li>Session PHP Extension</li> <li>Tokenizer PHP Extension</li> <li>XML PHP Extension</li> </ul> </div>  <h2 id="server-configuration">Server Configuration</h2>  <h3 id="nginx">Nginx</h3> <p>If you are deploying your application to a server that is running Nginx, you may use the following configuration file as a starting point for configuring your web server. Most likely, this file will need to be customized depending on your server's configuration. <strong>If you would like assistance in managing your server, consider using a first-party Laravel server management and deployment service such as <a href="https://forge.laravel.com">Laravel Forge</a>.</strong></p> <p>Please ensure, like the configuration below, your web server directs all requests to your application's <code>public/index.php</code> file. You should never attempt to move the <code>index.php</code> file to your project's root, as serving the application from the project root will expose many sensitive configuration files to the public Internet:</p> <pre data-language="nginx">server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /srv/example.com/public;
 
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
 
    index index.php;
 
    charset utf-8;
 
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }
 
    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
 
    error_page 404 /index.php;
 
    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
 
    location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
        deny all;
    }
}</pre>  <h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>  <h3 id="autoloader-optimization">Autoloader Optimization</h3> <p>When deploying to production, make sure that you are optimizing Composer's class autoloader map so Composer can quickly find the proper file to load for a given class:</p> <pre data-language="shell">composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev</pre> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> In addition to optimizing the autoloader, you should always be sure to include a <code>composer.lock</code> file in your project's source control repository. Your project's dependencies can be installed much faster when a <code>composer.lock</code> file is present.</p> </blockquote>  <h3 id="optimizing-configuration-loading">Caching Configuration</h3> <p>When deploying your application to production, you should make sure that you run the <code>config:cache</code> Artisan command during your deployment process:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan config:cache</pre> <p>This command will combine all of Laravel's configuration files into a single, cached file, which greatly reduces the number of trips the framework must make to the filesystem when loading your configuration values.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Warning</strong><br> If you execute the <code>config:cache</code> command during your deployment process, you should be sure that you are only calling the <code>env</code> function from within your configuration files. Once the configuration has been cached, the <code>.env</code> file will not be loaded and all calls to the <code>env</code> function for <code>.env</code> variables will return <code>null</code>.</p> </blockquote>  <h3 id="caching-events">Caching Events</h3> <p>If your application is utilizing <a href="events.html#event-discovery">event discovery</a>, you should cache your application's event to listener mappings during your deployment process. This can be accomplished by invoking the <code>event:cache</code> Artisan command during deployment:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan event:cache</pre>  <h3 id="optimizing-route-loading">Caching Routes</h3> <p>If you are building a large application with many routes, you should make sure that you are running the <code>route:cache</code> Artisan command during your deployment process:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan route:cache</pre> <p>This command reduces all of your route registrations into a single method call within a cached file, improving the performance of route registration when registering hundreds of routes.</p>  <h3 id="optimizing-view-loading">Caching Views</h3> <p>When deploying your application to production, you should make sure that you run the <code>view:cache</code> Artisan command during your deployment process:</p> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan view:cache</pre> <p>This command precompiles all your Blade views so they are not compiled on demand, improving the performance of each request that returns a view.</p>  <h2 id="debug-mode">Debug Mode</h2> <p>The debug option in your config/app.php configuration file determines how much information about an error is actually displayed to the user. By default, this option is set to respect the value of the <code>APP_DEBUG</code> environment variable, which is stored in your application's <code>.env</code> file.</p> <p><strong>In your production environment, this value should always be <code>false</code>. If the <code>APP_DEBUG</code> variable is set to <code>true</code> in production, you risk exposing sensitive configuration values to your application's end users.</strong></p>  <h2 id="deploying-with-forge-or-vapor">Easy Deployment With Forge / Vapor</h2>  <h4 id="laravel-forge">Laravel Forge</h4> <p>If you aren't quite ready to manage your own server configuration or aren't comfortable configuring all of the various services needed to run a robust Laravel application, <a href="https://forge.laravel.com">Laravel Forge</a> is a wonderful alternative.</p> <p>Laravel Forge can create servers on various infrastructure providers such as DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, and more.
