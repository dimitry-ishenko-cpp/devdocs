<h1>Laravel Mix</h1> <ul> <li> <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a> </li> </ul>  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p><a href="https://github.com/laravel-mix/laravel-mix">Laravel Mix</a>, a package developed by <a href="https://laracasts.com">Laracasts</a> creator Jeffrey Way, provides a fluent API for defining <a href="https://webpack.js.org">webpack</a> build steps for your Laravel application using several common CSS and JavaScript pre-processors.</p> <p>In other words, Mix makes it a cinch to compile and minify your application's CSS and JavaScript files. Through simple method chaining, you can fluently define your asset pipeline. For example:</p> <pre data-language="js">mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
    .postCss('resources/css/app.css', 'public/css');</pre> <p>If you've ever been confused and overwhelmed about getting started with webpack and asset compilation, you will love Laravel Mix. However, you are not required to use it while developing your application; you are free to use any asset pipeline tool you wish, or even none at all.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong><br> Vite has replaced Laravel Mix in new Laravel installations. For Mix documentation, please visit the <a href="https://laravel-mix.com/">official Laravel Mix</a> website. If you would like to switch to Vite, please see our <a href="https://github.com/laravel/vite-plugin/blob/main/UPGRADE.md#migrating-from-laravel-mix-to-vite">Vite migration guide</a>.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
