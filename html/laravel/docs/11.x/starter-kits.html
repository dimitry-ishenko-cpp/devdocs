These kits automatically scaffold your application with the routes, controllers, and views you need to register and authenticate your application's users.</p> <p>While you are welcome to use these starter kits, they are not required. You are free to build your own application from the ground up by simply installing a fresh copy of Laravel. Either way, we know you will build something great!</p>  <h2 id="laravel-breeze">Laravel Breeze</h2> <p><a href="https://github.com/laravel/breeze">Laravel Breeze</a> is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's <a href="authentication.html">authentication features</a>, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. In addition, Breeze includes a simple "profile" page where the user may update their name, email address, and password.</p> <p>Laravel Breeze's default view layer is made up of simple <a href="blade.html">Blade templates</a> styled with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>. Additionally, Breeze provides scaffolding options based on <a href="https://livewire.laravel.com">Livewire</a> or <a href="https://inertiajs.com">Inertia</a>, with the choice of using Vue or React for the Inertia-based scaffolding.</p> <img src="https://laravel.com/img/docs/breeze-register.png"> <h4>Laravel Bootcamp</h4> <p>If you're new to Laravel, feel free to jump into the <a href="https://bootcamp.laravel.com">Laravel Bootcamp</a>. The Laravel Bootcamp will walk you through building your first Laravel application using Breeze. It's a great way to get a tour of everything that Laravel and Breeze have to offer.</p>  <h3 id="laravel-breeze-installation">Installation</h3> <p>First, you should <a href="installation.html">create a new Laravel application</a>. If you create your application using the <a href="installation.html#creating-a-laravel-project">Laravel installer</a>, you will be prompted to install Laravel Breeze during the installation process. Otherwise, you will need to follow the manual installation instructions below.</p> <p>If you have already created a new Laravel application without a starter kit, you may manually install Laravel Breeze using Composer:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">composer require laravel/breeze --dev</pre> </div> <p>After Composer has installed the Laravel Breeze package, you should run the <code>breeze:install</code> Artisan command. This command publishes the authentication views, routes, controllers, and other resources to your application. Laravel Breeze publishes all of its code to your application so that you have full control and visibility over its features and implementation.</p> <p>The <code>breeze:install</code> command will prompt you for your preferred frontend stack and testing framework:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan breeze:install
 
php artisan migrate
npm install
npm run dev</pre> </div>  <h3 id="breeze-and-blade">Breeze and Blade</h3> <p>The default Breeze "stack" is the Blade stack, which utilizes simple <a href="blade.html">Blade templates</a> to render your application's frontend. The Blade stack may be installed by invoking the <code>breeze:install</code> command with no other additional arguments and selecting the Blade frontend stack. After Breeze's scaffolding is installed, you should also compile your application's frontend assets:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan breeze:install
 
php artisan migrate
npm install
npm run dev</pre> </div> <p>Next, you may navigate to your application's <code>/login</code> or <code>/register</code> URLs in your web browser. All of Breeze's routes are defined within the <code>routes/auth.php</code> file.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>
</svg></div> </div> <p class="mb-0 lg:ml-6 callout"> To learn more about compiling your application's CSS and JavaScript, check out Laravel's <a href="vite.html#running-vite">Vite documentation</a>.</p> </div>  <h3 id="breeze-and-livewire">Breeze and Livewire</h3> <p>Laravel Breeze also offers <a href="https://livewire.laravel.com">Livewire</a> scaffolding. Livewire is a powerful way of building dynamic, reactive, front-end UIs using just PHP.</p> <p>Livewire is a great fit for teams that primarily use Blade templates and are looking for a simpler alternative to JavaScript-driven SPA frameworks like Vue and React.</p> <p>To use the Livewire stack, you may select the Livewire frontend stack when executing the <code>breeze:install</code> Artisan command. After Breeze's scaffolding is installed, you should run your database migrations:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan breeze:install
 
php artisan migrate</pre> </div>  <h3 id="breeze-and-inertia">Breeze and React / Vue</h3> <p>Laravel Breeze also offers React and Vue scaffolding via an <a href="https://inertiajs.com">Inertia</a> frontend implementation. Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page React and Vue applications using classic server-side routing and controllers.</p> <p>Inertia lets you enjoy the frontend power of React and Vue combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast <a href="https://vitejs.dev">Vite</a> compilation. To use an Inertia stack, you may select the Vue or React frontend stacks when executing the <code>breeze:install</code> Artisan command.</p> <p>When selecting the Vue or React frontend stack, the Breeze installer will also prompt you to determine if you would like <a href="https://inertiajs.com/server-side-rendering">Inertia SSR</a> or TypeScript support. After Breeze's scaffolding is installed, you should also compile your application's frontend assets:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan breeze:install
 
php artisan migrate
npm install
npm run dev</pre> </div> <p>Next, you may navigate to your application's <code>/login</code> or <code>/register</code> URLs in your web browser. All of Breeze's routes are defined within the <code>routes/auth.php</code> file.</p>  <h3 id="breeze-and-next">Breeze and Next.js / API</h3> <p>Laravel Breeze can also scaffold an authentication API that is ready to authenticate modern JavaScript applications such as those powered by <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next</a>, <a href="https://nuxt.com">Nuxt</a>, and others. To get started, select the API stack as your desired stack when executing the <code>breeze:install</code> Artisan command:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan breeze:install
 
php artisan migrate</pre> </div> <p>During installation, Breeze will add a <code>FRONTEND_URL</code> environment variable to your application's <code>.env</code> file. This URL should be the URL of your JavaScript application. This will typically be <code>http://localhost:3000</code> during local development. In addition, you should ensure that your <code>APP_URL</code> is set to <code>http://localhost:8000</code>, which is the default URL used by the <code>serve</code> Artisan command.</p>  <h4 id="next-reference-implementation">Next.js Reference Implementation</h4> <p>Finally, you are ready to pair this backend with the frontend of your choice. A Next reference implementation of the Breeze frontend is <a href="https://github.com/laravel/breeze-next">available on GitHub</a>. This frontend is maintained by Laravel and contains the same user interface as the traditional Blade and Inertia stacks provided by Breeze.</p>  <h2 id="laravel-jetstream">Laravel Jetstream</h2> <p>While Laravel Breeze provides a simple and minimal starting point for building a Laravel application, Jetstream augments that functionality with more robust features and additional frontend technology stacks. <strong>For those brand new to Laravel, we recommend learning the ropes with Laravel Breeze before graduating to Laravel Jetstream.</strong></p> <p>Jetstream provides a beautifully designed application scaffolding for Laravel and includes login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via Laravel Sanctum, and optional team management. Jetstream is designed using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a> and offers your choice of <a href="https://livewire.laravel.com">Livewire</a> or <a href="https://inertiajs.com">Inertia</a> driven frontend scaffolding.</p> <p>Complete documentation for installing Laravel Jetstream can be found within the <a href="https://jetstream.laravel.com">official Jetstream documentation</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
