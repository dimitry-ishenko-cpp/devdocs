For example, a blog post may have many comments or an order could be related to the user who placed it. Eloquent makes managing and working with these relationships easy, and supports a variety of common relationships:</p> <div class="content-list" markdown="1"> <ul> <li> <a href="#one-to-one">One To One</a> </li> <li> <a href="#one-to-many">One To Many</a> </li> <li> <a href="#many-to-many">Many To Many</a> </li> <li> <a href="#has-one-through">Has One Through</a> </li> <li> <a href="#has-many-through">Has Many Through</a> </li> <li> <a href="#one-to-one-polymorphic-relations">One To One (Polymorphic)</a> </li> <li> <a href="#one-to-many-polymorphic-relations">One To Many (Polymorphic)</a> </li> <li> <a href="#many-to-many-polymorphic-relations">Many To Many (Polymorphic)</a> </li> </ul> </div>  <h2 id="defining-relationships">Defining Relationships</h2> <p>Eloquent relationships are defined as methods on your Eloquent model classes. Since relationships also serve as powerful <a href="queries.html">query builders</a>, defining relationships as methods provides powerful method chaining and querying capabilities. For example, we may chain additional query constraints on this <code>posts</code> relationship:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user-&gt;posts()-&gt;where('active', 1)-&gt;get();</pre> <p>But, before diving too deep into using relationships, let's learn how to define each type of relationship supported by Eloquent.</p>  <h3 id="one-to-one">One to One</h3> <p>A one-to-one relationship is a very basic type of database relationship. For example, a <code>User</code> model might be associated with one <code>Phone</code> model. To define this relationship, we will place a <code>phone</code> method on the <code>User</code> model. The <code>phone</code> method should call the <code>hasOne</code> method and return its result. The <code>hasOne</code> method is available to your model via the model's <code>Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model</code> base class:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasOne;
 
class User extends Model
{
    /**
     * Get the phone associated with the user.
     */
    public function phone(): HasOne
    {
        return $this-&gt;hasOne(Phone::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>The first argument passed to the <code>hasOne</code> method is the name of the related model class. Once the relationship is defined, we may retrieve the related record using Eloquent's dynamic properties. Dynamic properties allow you to access relationship methods as if they were properties defined on the model:</p> <pre data-language="php">$phone = User::find(1)-&gt;phone;</pre> <p>Eloquent determines the foreign key of the relationship based on the parent model name. In this case, the <code>Phone</code> model is automatically assumed to have a <code>user_id</code> foreign key. If you wish to override this convention, you may pass a second argument to the <code>hasOne</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">return $this-&gt;hasOne(Phone::class, 'foreign_key');</pre> <p>Additionally, Eloquent assumes that the foreign key should have a value matching the primary key column of the parent. In other words, Eloquent will look for the value of the user's <code>id</code> column in the <code>user_id</code> column of the <code>Phone</code> record. If you would like the relationship to use a primary key value other than <code>id</code> or your model's <code>$primaryKey</code> property, you may pass a third argument to the <code>hasOne</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">return $this-&gt;hasOne(Phone::class, 'foreign_key', 'local_key');</pre>  <h4 id="one-to-one-defining-the-inverse-of-the-relationship">Defining the Inverse of the Relationship</h4> <p>So, we can access the <code>Phone</code> model from our <code>User</code> model. Next, let's define a relationship on the <code>Phone</code> model that will let us access the user that owns the phone. We can define the inverse of a <code>hasOne</code> relationship using the <code>belongsTo</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
 
class Phone extends Model
{
    /**
     * Get the user that owns the phone.
     */
    public function user(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this-&gt;belongsTo(User::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>When invoking the <code>user</code> method, Eloquent will attempt to find a <code>User</code> model that has an <code>id</code> which matches the <code>user_id</code> column on the <code>Phone</code> model.</p> <p>Eloquent determines the foreign key name by examining the name of the relationship method and suffixing the method name with <code>_id</code>. So, in this case, Eloquent assumes that the <code>Phone</code> model has a <code>user_id</code> column. However, if the foreign key on the <code>Phone</code> model is not <code>user_id</code>, you may pass a custom key name as the second argument to the <code>belongsTo</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the user that owns the phone.
 */
public function user(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo(User::class, 'foreign_key');
}</pre> <p>If the parent model does not use <code>id</code> as its primary key, or you wish to find the associated model using a different column, you may pass a third argument to the <code>belongsTo</code> method specifying the parent table's custom key:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the user that owns the phone.
 */
public function user(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo(User::class, 'foreign_key', 'owner_key');
}</pre>  <h3 id="one-to-many">One to Many</h3> <p>A one-to-many relationship is used to define relationships where a single model is the parent to one or more child models. For example, a blog post may have an infinite number of comments. Like all other Eloquent relationships, one-to-many relationships are defined by defining a method on your Eloquent model:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;
 
class Post extends Model
{
    /**
     * Get the comments for the blog post.
     */
    public function comments(): HasMany
    {
        return $this-&gt;hasMany(Comment::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>Remember, Eloquent will automatically determine the proper foreign key column for the <code>Comment</code> model. By convention, Eloquent will take the "snake case" name of the parent model and suffix it with <code>_id</code>. So, in this example, Eloquent will assume the foreign key column on the <code>Comment</code> model is <code>post_id</code>.</p> <p>Once the relationship method has been defined, we can access the <a href="eloquent-collections.html">collection</a> of related comments by accessing the <code>comments</code> property. Remember, since Eloquent provides "dynamic relationship properties", we can access relationship methods as if they were defined as properties on the model:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Post;
 
$comments = Post::find(1)-&gt;comments;
 
foreach ($comments as $comment) {
    // ...
}</pre> <p>Since all relationships also serve as query builders, you may add further constraints to the relationship query by calling the <code>comments</code> method and continuing to chain conditions onto the query:</p> <pre data-language="php">$comment = Post::find(1)-&gt;comments()
                    -&gt;where('title', 'foo')
                    -&gt;first();</pre> <p>Like the <code>hasOne</code> method, you may also override the foreign and local keys by passing additional arguments to the <code>hasMany</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">return $this-&gt;hasMany(Comment::class, 'foreign_key');
 
return $this-&gt;hasMany(Comment::class, 'foreign_key', 'local_key');</pre>  <h3 id="one-to-many-inverse">One to Many (Inverse) / Belongs To</h3> <p>Now that we can access all of a post's comments, let's define a relationship to allow a comment to access its parent post. To define the inverse of a <code>hasMany</code> relationship, define a relationship method on the child model which calls the <code>belongsTo</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
 
class Comment extends Model
{
    /**
     * Get the post that owns the comment.
     */
    public function post(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this-&gt;belongsTo(Post::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>Once the relationship has been defined, we can retrieve a comment's parent post by accessing the <code>post</code> "dynamic relationship property":</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Comment;
 
$comment = Comment::find(1);
 
return $comment-&gt;post-&gt;title;</pre> <p>In the example above, Eloquent will attempt to find a <code>Post</code> model that has an <code>id</code> which matches the <code>post_id</code> column on the <code>Comment</code> model.</p> <p>Eloquent determines the default foreign key name by examining the name of the relationship method and suffixing the method name with a <code>_</code> followed by the name of the parent model's primary key column. So, in this example, Eloquent will assume the <code>Post</code> model's foreign key on the <code>comments</code> table is <code>post_id</code>.</p> <p>However, if the foreign key for your relationship does not follow these conventions, you may pass a custom foreign key name as the second argument to the <code>belongsTo</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the post that owns the comment.
 */
public function post(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo(Post::class, 'foreign_key');
}</pre> <p>If your parent model does not use <code>id</code> as its primary key, or you wish to find the associated model using a different column, you may pass a third argument to the <code>belongsTo</code> method specifying your parent table's custom key:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the post that owns the comment.
 */
public function post(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo(Post::class, 'foreign_key', 'owner_key');
}</pre>  <h4 id="default-models">Default Models</h4> <p>The <code>belongsTo</code>, <code>hasOne</code>, <code>hasOneThrough</code>, and <code>morphOne</code> relationships allow you to define a default model that will be returned if the given relationship is <code>null</code>. This pattern is often referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern">Null Object pattern</a> and can help remove conditional checks in your code. In the following example, the <code>user</code> relation will return an empty <code>App\Models\User</code> model if no user is attached to the <code>Post</code> model:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the author of the post.
 */
public function user(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo(User::class)-&gt;withDefault();
}</pre> <p>To populate the default model with attributes, you may pass an array or closure to the <code>withDefault</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the author of the post.
 */
public function user(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo(User::class)-&gt;withDefault([
        'name' =&gt; 'Guest Author',
    ]);
}
 
/**
 * Get the author of the post.
 */
public function user(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo(User::class)-&gt;withDefault(function (User $user, Post $post) {
        $user-&gt;name = 'Guest Author';
    });
}</pre>  <h4 id="querying-belongs-to-relationships">Querying Belongs To Relationships</h4> <p>When querying for the children of a "belongs to" relationship, you may manually build the <code>where</code> clause to retrieve the corresponding Eloquent models:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Post;
 
$posts = Post::where('user_id', $user-&gt;id)-&gt;get();</pre> <p>However, you may find it more convenient to use the <code>whereBelongsTo</code> method, which will automatically determine the proper relationship and foreign key for the given model:</p> <pre data-language="php">$posts = Post::whereBelongsTo($user)-&gt;get();</pre> <p>You may also provide a <a href="eloquent-collections.html">collection</a> instance to the <code>whereBelongsTo</code> method. When doing so, Laravel will retrieve models that belong to any of the parent models within the collection:</p> <pre data-language="php">$users = User::where('vip', true)-&gt;get();
 
$posts = Post::whereBelongsTo($users)-&gt;get();</pre> <p>By default, Laravel will determine the relationship associated with the given model based on the class name of the model; however, you may specify the relationship name manually by providing it as the second argument to the <code>whereBelongsTo</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">$posts = Post::whereBelongsTo($user, 'author')-&gt;get();</pre>  <h3 id="has-one-of-many">Has One of Many</h3> <p>Sometimes a model may have many related models, yet you want to easily retrieve the "latest" or "oldest" related model of the relationship. For example, a <code>User</code> model may be related to many <code>Order</code> models, but you want to define a convenient way to interact with the most recent order the user has placed. You may accomplish this using the <code>hasOne</code> relationship type combined with the <code>ofMany</code> methods:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the user's most recent order.
 */
public function latestOrder(): HasOne
{
    return $this-&gt;hasOne(Order::class)-&gt;latestOfMany();
}</pre> </div> <p>Likewise, you may define a method to retrieve the "oldest", or first, related model of a relationship:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the user's oldest order.
 */
public function oldestOrder(): HasOne
{
    return $this-&gt;hasOne(Order::class)-&gt;oldestOfMany();
}</pre> </div> <p>By default, the <code>latestOfMany</code> and <code>oldestOfMany</code> methods will retrieve the latest or oldest related model based on the model's primary key, which must be sortable. However, sometimes you may wish to retrieve a single model from a larger relationship using a different sorting criteria.</p> <p>For example, using the <code>ofMany</code> method, you may retrieve the user's most expensive order. The <code>ofMany</code> method accepts the sortable column as its first argument and which aggregate function (<code>min</code> or <code>max</code>) to apply when querying for the related model:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the user's largest order.
 */
public function largestOrder(): HasOne
{
    return $this-&gt;hasOne(Order::class)-&gt;ofMany('price', 'max');
}</pre> </div> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-red-600"> <div class="opacity-75">
<svg width="6" height="35" viewbox="0 0 6 35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>exclamation</title>
</svg> </div> </div> <p class="mb-0 lg:ml-6 callout"> Because PostgreSQL does not support executing the <code>MAX</code> function against UUID columns, it is not currently possible to use one-of-many relationships in combination with PostgreSQL UUID columns.</p> </div>  <h4 id="converting-many-relationships-to-has-one-relationships">Converting "Many" Relationships to Has One Relationships</h4> <p>Often, when retrieving a single model using the <code>latestOfMany</code>, <code>oldestOfMany</code>, or <code>ofMany</code> methods, you already have a "has many" relationship defined for the same model. For convenience, Laravel allows you to easily convert this relationship into a "has one" relationship by invoking the <code>one</code> method on the relationship:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the user's orders.
 */
public function orders(): HasMany
{
    return $this-&gt;hasMany(Order::class);
}
 
/**
 * Get the user's largest order.
 */
public function largestOrder(): HasOne
{
    return $this-&gt;orders()-&gt;one()-&gt;ofMany('price', 'max');
}</pre> </div>  <h4 id="advanced-has-one-of-many-relationships">Advanced Has One of Many Relationships</h4> <p>It is possible to construct more advanced "has one of many" relationships. For example, a <code>Product</code> model may have many associated <code>Price</code> models that are retained in the system even after new pricing is published. In addition, new pricing data for the product may be able to be published in advance to take effect at a future date via a <code>published_at</code> column.</p> <p>So, in summary, we need to retrieve the latest published pricing where the published date is not in the future. In addition, if two prices have the same published date, we will prefer the price with the greatest ID. To accomplish this, we must pass an array to the <code>ofMany</code> method that contains the sortable columns which determine the latest price. In addition, a closure will be provided as the second argument to the <code>ofMany</code> method. This closure will be responsible for adding additional publish date constraints to the relationship query:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the current pricing for the product.
 */
public function currentPricing(): HasOne
{
    return $this-&gt;hasOne(Price::class)-&gt;ofMany([
        'published_at' =&gt; 'max',
        'id' =&gt; 'max',
    ], function (Builder $query) {
        $query-&gt;where('published_at', '&lt;', now());
    });
}</pre> </div>  <h3 id="has-one-through">Has One Through</h3> <p>The "has-one-through" relationship defines a one-to-one relationship with another model. However, this relationship indicates that the declaring model can be matched with one instance of another model by proceeding <em>through</em> a third model.</p> <p>For example, in a vehicle repair shop application, each <code>Mechanic</code> model may be associated with one <code>Car</code> model, and each <code>Car</code> model may be associated with one <code>Owner</code> model. While the mechanic and the owner have no direct relationship within the database, the mechanic can access the owner <em>through</em> the <code>Car</code> model. Let's look at the tables necessary to define this relationship:</p> <pre data-language="php">mechanics
    id - integer
    name - string
 
cars
    id - integer
    model - string
    mechanic_id - integer
 
owners
    id - integer
    name - string
    car_id - integer</pre> <p>Now that we have examined the table structure for the relationship, let's define the relationship on the <code>Mechanic</code> model:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasOneThrough;
 
class Mechanic extends Model
{
    /**
     * Get the car's owner.
     */
    public function carOwner(): HasOneThrough
    {
        return $this-&gt;hasOneThrough(Owner::class, Car::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>The first argument passed to the <code>hasOneThrough</code> method is the name of the final model we wish to access, while the second argument is the name of the intermediate model.</p> <p>Or, if the relevant relationships have already been defined on all of the models involved in the relationship, you may fluently define a "has-one-through" relationship by invoking the <code>through</code> method and supplying the names of those relationships. For example, if the <code>Mechanic</code> model has a <code>cars</code> relationship and the <code>Car</code> model has an <code>owner</code> relationship, you may define a "has-one-through" relationship connecting the mechanic and the owner like so:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">// String based syntax...
return $this-&gt;through('cars')-&gt;has('owner');
 
// Dynamic syntax...
return $this-&gt;throughCars()-&gt;hasOwner();</pre> </div>  <h4 id="has-one-through-key-conventions">Key Conventions</h4> <p>Typical Eloquent foreign key conventions will be used when performing the relationship's queries. If you would like to customize the keys of the relationship, you may pass them as the third and fourth arguments to the <code>hasOneThrough</code> method. The third argument is the name of the foreign key on the intermediate model. The fourth argument is the name of the foreign key on the final model. The fifth argument is the local key, while the sixth argument is the local key of the intermediate model:</p> <pre data-language="php">class Mechanic extends Model
{
    /**
     * Get the car's owner.
     */
    public function carOwner(): HasOneThrough
    {
        return $this-&gt;hasOneThrough(
            Owner::class,
            Car::class,
            'mechanic_id', // Foreign key on the cars table...
            'car_id', // Foreign key on the owners table...
            'id', // Local key on the mechanics table...
            'id' // Local key on the cars table...
        );
    }
}</pre> <p>Or, as discussed earlier, if the relevant relationships have already been defined on all of the models involved in the relationship, you may fluently define a "has-one-through" relationship by invoking the <code>through</code> method and supplying the names of those relationships. This approach offers the advantage of reusing the key conventions already defined on the existing relationships:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">// String based syntax...
return $this-&gt;through('cars')-&gt;has('owner');
 
// Dynamic syntax...
return $this-&gt;throughCars()-&gt;hasOwner();</pre> </div>  <h3 id="has-many-through">Has Many Through</h3> <p>The "has-many-through" relationship provides a convenient way to access distant relations via an intermediate relation. For example, let's assume we are building a deployment platform like <a href="https://vapor.laravel.com">Laravel Vapor</a>. A <code>Project</code> model might access many <code>Deployment</code> models through an intermediate <code>Environment</code> model. Using this example, you could easily gather all deployments for a given project. Let's look at the tables required to define this relationship:</p> <pre data-language="php">projects
    id - integer
    name - string
 
environments
    id - integer
    project_id - integer
    name - string
 
deployments
    id - integer
    environment_id - integer
    commit_hash - string</pre> <p>Now that we have examined the table structure for the relationship, let's define the relationship on the <code>Project</code> model:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasManyThrough;
 
class Project extends Model
{
    /**
     * Get all of the deployments for the project.
     */
    public function deployments(): HasManyThrough
    {
        return $this-&gt;hasManyThrough(Deployment::class, Environment::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>The first argument passed to the <code>hasManyThrough</code> method is the name of the final model we wish to access, while the second argument is the name of the intermediate model.</p> <p>Or, if the relevant relationships have already been defined on all of the models involved in the relationship, you may fluently define a "has-many-through" relationship by invoking the <code>through</code> method and supplying the names of those relationships. For example, if the <code>Project</code> model has a <code>environments</code> relationship and the <code>Environment</code> model has a <code>deployments</code> relationship, you may define a "has-many-through" relationship connecting the project and the deployments like so:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">// String based syntax...
return $this-&gt;through('environments')-&gt;has('deployments');
 
// Dynamic syntax...
return $this-&gt;throughEnvironments()-&gt;hasDeployments();</pre> </div> <p>Though the <code>Deployment</code> model's table does not contain a <code>project_id</code> column, the <code>hasManyThrough</code> relation provides access to a project's deployments via <code>$project-&gt;deployments</code>. To retrieve these models, Eloquent inspects the <code>project_id</code> column on the intermediate <code>Environment</code> model's table. After finding the relevant environment IDs, they are used to query the <code>Deployment</code> model's table.</p>  <h4 id="has-many-through-key-conventions">Key Conventions</h4> <p>Typical Eloquent foreign key conventions will be used when performing the relationship's queries. If you would like to customize the keys of the relationship, you may pass them as the third and fourth arguments to the <code>hasManyThrough</code> method. The third argument is the name of the foreign key on the intermediate model. The fourth argument is the name of the foreign key on the final model. The fifth argument is the local key, while the sixth argument is the local key of the intermediate model:</p> <pre data-language="php">class Project extends Model
{

        );
    }
}</pre> <p>Or, as discussed earlier, if the relevant relationships have already been defined on all of the models involved in the relationship, you may fluently define a "has-many-through" relationship by invoking the <code>through</code> method and supplying the names of those relationships. This approach offers the advantage of reusing the key conventions already defined on the existing relationships:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">// String based syntax...
return $this-&gt;through('environments')-&gt;has('deployments');
 
// Dynamic syntax...
return $this-&gt;throughEnvironments()-&gt;hasDeployments();</pre> </div>  <h2 id="many-to-many">Many to Many Relationships</h2> <p>Many-to-many relations are slightly more complicated than <code>hasOne</code> and <code>hasMany</code> relationships. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a user that has many roles and those roles are also shared by other users in the application. For example, a user may be assigned the role of "Author" and "Editor"; however, those roles may also be assigned to other users as well. So, a user has many roles and a role has many users.</p>  <h4 id="many-to-many-table-structure">Table Structure</h4> <p>To define this relationship, three database tables are needed: <code>users</code>, <code>roles</code>, and <code>role_user</code>. The <code>role_user</code> table is derived from the alphabetical order of the related model names and contains <code>user_id</code> and <code>role_id</code> columns. This table is used as an intermediate table linking the users and roles.</p> <p>Remember, since a role can belong to many users, we cannot simply place a <code>user_id</code> column on the <code>roles</code> table. This would mean that a role could only belong to a single user. In order to provide support for roles being assigned to multiple users, the <code>role_user</code> table is needed. We can summarize the relationship's table structure like so:</p> <pre data-language="php">users
    id - integer
    name - string
 
roles
    id - integer
    name - string
 
role_user
    user_id - integer
    role_id - integer</pre>  <h4 id="many-to-many-model-structure">Model Structure</h4> <p>Many-to-many relationships are defined by writing a method that returns the result of the <code>belongsToMany</code> method. The <code>belongsToMany</code> method is provided by the <code>Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model</code> base class that is used by all of your application's Eloquent models. For example, let's define a <code>roles</code> method on our <code>User</code> model. The first argument passed to this method is the name of the related model class:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;
 
class User extends Model
{
    /**
     * The roles that belong to the user.
     */
    public function roles(): BelongsToMany
    {
        return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(Role::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>Once the relationship is defined, you may access the user's roles using the <code>roles</code> dynamic relationship property:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\User;
 
$user = User::find(1);
 
foreach ($user-&gt;roles as $role) {
    // ...
}</pre> <p>Since all relationships also serve as query builders, you may add further constraints to the relationship query by calling the <code>roles</code> method and continuing to chain conditions onto the query:</p> <pre data-language="php">$roles = User::find(1)-&gt;roles()-&gt;orderBy('name')-&gt;get();</pre> <p>To determine the table name of the relationship's intermediate table, Eloquent will join the two related model names in alphabetical order. However, you are free to override this convention. You may do so by passing a second argument to the <code>belongsToMany</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(Role::class, 'role_user');</pre> <p>In addition to customizing the name of the intermediate table, you may also customize the column names of the keys on the table by passing additional arguments to the <code>belongsToMany</code> method. The third argument is the foreign key name of the model on which you are defining the relationship, while the fourth argument is the foreign key name of the model that you are joining to:</p> <pre data-language="php">return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(Role::class, 'role_user', 'user_id', 'role_id');</pre>  <h4 id="many-to-many-defining-the-inverse-of-the-relationship">Defining the Inverse of the Relationship</h4> <p>To define the "inverse" of a many-to-many relationship, you should define a method on the related model which also returns the result of the <code>belongsToMany</code> method. To complete our user / role example, let's define the <code>users</code> method on the <code>Role</code> model:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;
 
class Role extends Model
{
    /**
     * The users that belong to the role.
     */
    public function users(): BelongsToMany
    {
        return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(User::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>As you can see, the relationship is defined exactly the same as its <code>User</code> model counterpart with the exception of referencing the <code>App\Models\User</code> model. Since we're reusing the <code>belongsToMany</code> method, all of the usual table and key customization options are available when defining the "inverse" of many-to-many relationships.</p>  <h3 id="retrieving-intermediate-table-columns">Retrieving Intermediate Table Columns</h3> <p>As you have already learned, working with many-to-many relations requires the presence of an intermediate table. Eloquent provides some very helpful ways of interacting with this table. For example, let's assume our <code>User</code> model has many <code>Role</code> models that it is related to. After accessing this relationship, we may access the intermediate table using the <code>pivot</code> attribute on the models:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\User;
 
$user = User::find(1);
 
foreach ($user-&gt;roles as $role) {
    echo $role-&gt;pivot-&gt;created_at;
}</pre> <p>Notice that each <code>Role</code> model we retrieve is automatically assigned a <code>pivot</code> attribute. This attribute contains a model representing the intermediate table.</p> <p>By default, only the model keys will be present on the <code>pivot</code> model. If your intermediate table contains extra attributes, you must specify them when defining the relationship:</p> <pre data-language="php">return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(Role::class)-&gt;withPivot('active', 'created_by');</pre> <p>If you would like your intermediate table to have <code>created_at</code> and <code>updated_at</code> timestamps that are automatically maintained by Eloquent, call the <code>withTimestamps</code> method when defining the relationship:</p> <pre data-language="php">return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(Role::class)-&gt;withTimestamps();</pre> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-red-600"> <div class="opacity-75">

However, you are free to customize the name of this attribute to better reflect its purpose within your application.</p> <p>For example, if your application contains users that may subscribe to podcasts, you likely have a many-to-many relationship between users and podcasts. If this is the case, you may wish to rename your intermediate table attribute to <code>subscription</code> instead of <code>pivot</code>. This can be done using the <code>as</code> method when defining the relationship:</p> <pre data-language="php">return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(Podcast::class)
                -&gt;as('subscription')
                -&gt;withTimestamps();</pre> <p>Once the custom intermediate table attribute has been specified, you may access the intermediate table data using the customized name:</p> <pre data-language="php">$users = User::with('podcasts')-&gt;get();
 
foreach ($users-&gt;flatMap-&gt;podcasts as $podcast) {
    echo $podcast-&gt;subscription-&gt;created_at;
}</pre>  <h3 id="filtering-queries-via-intermediate-table-columns">Filtering Queries via Intermediate Table Columns</h3> <p>You can also filter the results returned by <code>belongsToMany</code> relationship queries using the <code>wherePivot</code>, <code>wherePivotIn</code>, <code>wherePivotNotIn</code>, <code>wherePivotBetween</code>, <code>wherePivotNotBetween</code>, <code>wherePivotNull</code>, and <code>wherePivotNotNull</code> methods when defining the relationship:</p> <pre data-language="php">return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(Role::class)
                -&gt;wherePivot('approved', 1);
 
return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(Role::class)
                -&gt;wherePivotIn('priority', [1, 2]);
 
return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(Role::class)
                -&gt;wherePivotNotIn('priority', [1, 2]);

                -&gt;where('rank', 'gold')

Custom pivot models give you the opportunity to define additional behavior on the pivot model, such as methods and casts.</p> <p>Custom many-to-many pivot models should extend the <code>Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot</code> class while custom polymorphic many-to-many pivot models should extend the <code>Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphPivot</code> class.

Using a one-to-one polymorphic relation allows you to have a single table of unique images that may be associated with posts and users.

The <code>imageable_id</code> column will contain the ID value of the post or user, while the <code>imageable_type</code> column will contain the class name of the parent model. The <code>imageable_type</code> column is used by Eloquent to determine which "type" of parent model to return when accessing the <code>imageable</code> relation.

}</pre>  <h4 id="many-to-many-polymorphic-retrieving-the-relationship">Retrieving the Relationship</h4> <p>Once your database table and models are defined, you may access the relationships via your models. For example, to access all of the tags for a post, you may use the <code>tags</code> dynamic relationship property:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Post;
 
$post = Post::find(1);
 
foreach ($post-&gt;tags as $tag) {
    // ...
}</pre> <p>You may retrieve the parent of a polymorphic relation from the polymorphic child model by accessing the name of the method that performs the call to <code>morphedByMany</code>. In this case, that is the <code>posts</code> or <code>videos</code> methods on the <code>Tag</code> model:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Tag;
 
$tag = Tag::find(1);
 
foreach ($tag-&gt;posts as $post) {
    // ...
}
 
foreach ($tag-&gt;videos as $video) {
    // ...
}</pre>  <h3 id="custom-polymorphic-types">Custom Polymorphic Types</h3> <p>By default, Laravel will use the fully qualified class name to store the "type" of the related model. For instance, given the one-to-many relationship example above where a <code>Comment</code> model may belong to a <code>Post</code> or a <code>Video</code> model, the default <code>commentable_type</code> would be either <code>App\Models\Post</code> or <code>App\Models\Video</code>, respectively. However, you may wish to decouple these values from your application's internal structure.</p> <p>For example, instead of using the model names as the "type", we may use simple strings such as <code>post</code> and <code>video</code>. By doing so, the polymorphic "type" column values in our database will remain valid even if the models are renamed:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Relation;
 
Relation::enforceMorphMap([
    'post' =&gt; 'App\Models\Post',
    'video' =&gt; 'App\Models\Video',
]);</pre> <p>You may call the <code>enforceMorphMap</code> method in the <code>boot</code> method of your <code>App\Providers\AppServiceProvider</code> class or create a separate service provider if you wish.</p> <p>You may determine the morph alias of a given model at runtime using the model's <code>getMorphClass</code> method. Conversely, you may determine the fully-qualified class name associated with a morph alias using the <code>Relation::getMorphedModel</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Relation;
 
$alias = $post-&gt;getMorphClass();
 
$class = Relation::getMorphedModel($alias);</pre> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-red-600"> <div class="opacity-75">

While not typically recommended for normal application development, this may occasionally be useful when developing Laravel packages.</p> <p>The <code>resolveRelationUsing</code> method accepts the desired relationship name as its first argument. The second argument passed to the method should be a closure that accepts the model instance and returns a valid Eloquent relationship definition. Typically, you should configure dynamic relationships within the boot method of a <a href="providers.html">service provider</a>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Order;
use App\Models\Customer;
 
Order::resolveRelationUsing('customer', function (Order $orderModel) {

In addition, all types of Eloquent relationships also serve as <a href="queries.html">query builders</a>, allowing you to continue to chain constraints onto the relationship query before finally executing the SQL query against your database.</p> <p>For example, imagine a blog application in which a <code>User</code> model has many associated <code>Post</code> models:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;
 
class User extends Model
{
    /**
     * Get all of the posts for the user.
     */
    public function posts(): HasMany
    {
        return $this-&gt;hasMany(Post::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>You may query the <code>posts</code> relationship and add additional constraints to the relationship like so:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\User;
 
$user = User::find(1);
 
$user-&gt;posts()-&gt;where('active', 1)-&gt;get();</pre> <p>You are able to use any of the Laravel <a href="queries.html">query builder's</a> methods on the relationship, so be sure to explore the query builder documentation to learn about all of the methods that are available to you.</p>  <h4 id="chaining-orwhere-clauses-after-relationships">Chaining <code>orWhere</code> Clauses After Relationships</h4> <p>As demonstrated in the example above, you are free to add additional constraints to relationships when querying them. However, use caution when chaining <code>orWhere</code> clauses onto a relationship, as the <code>orWhere</code> clauses will be logically grouped at the same level as the relationship constraint:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user-&gt;posts()
        -&gt;where('active', 1)
        -&gt;orWhere('votes', '&gt;=', 100)
        -&gt;get();</pre> <p>The example above will generate the following SQL. As you can see, the <code>or</code> clause instructs the query to return <em>any</em> post with greater than 100 votes. The query is no longer constrained to a specific user:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="sql">select *
from posts
where user_id = ? and active = 1 or votes &gt;= 100</pre> </div> <p>In most situations, you should use <a href="queries.html#logical-grouping">logical groups</a> to group the conditional checks between parentheses:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
 
$user-&gt;posts()
        -&gt;where(function (Builder $query) {
            return $query-&gt;where('active', 1)
                         -&gt;orWhere('votes', '&gt;=', 100);
        })
        -&gt;get();</pre> <p>The example above will produce the following SQL. Note that the logical grouping has properly grouped the constraints and the query remains constrained to a specific user:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="sql">select *
from posts
where user_id = ? and (active = 1 or votes &gt;= 100)</pre> </div>  <h3 id="relationship-methods-vs-dynamic-properties">Relationship Methods vs. Dynamic Properties</h3> <p>If you do not need to add additional constraints to an Eloquent relationship query, you may access the relationship as if it were a property. For example, continuing to use our <code>User</code> and <code>Post</code> example models, we may access all of a user's posts like so:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\User;
 
$user = User::find(1);
 
foreach ($user-&gt;posts as $post) {
    // ...
}</pre> <p>Dynamic relationship properties perform "lazy loading", meaning they will only load their relationship data when you actually access them. Because of this, developers often use <a href="#eager-loading">eager loading</a> to pre-load relationships they know will be accessed after loading the model. Eager loading provides a significant reduction in SQL queries that must be executed to load a model's relations.</p>  <h3 id="querying-relationship-existence">Querying Relationship Existence</h3> <p>When retrieving model records, you may wish to limit your results based on the existence of a relationship. For example, imagine you want to retrieve all blog posts that have at least one comment. To do so, you may pass the name of the relationship to the <code>has</code> and <code>orHas</code> methods:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Post;
 
// Retrieve all posts that have at least one comment...
$posts = Post::has('comments')-&gt;get();</pre> <p>You may also specify an operator and count value to further customize the query:</p> <pre data-language="php">// Retrieve all posts that have three or more comments...
$posts = Post::has('comments', '&gt;=', 3)-&gt;get();</pre> <p>Nested <code>has</code> statements may be constructed using "dot" notation. For example, you may retrieve all posts that have at least one comment that has at least one image:</p> <pre data-language="php">// Retrieve posts that have at least one comment with images...
$posts = Post::has('comments.images')-&gt;get();</pre> <p>If you need even more power, you may use the <code>whereHas</code> and <code>orWhereHas</code> methods to define additional query constraints on your <code>has</code> queries, such as inspecting the content of a comment:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
 
// Retrieve posts with at least one comment containing words like code%...
$posts = Post::whereHas('comments', function (Builder $query) {

For example, we may query for all posts that have unapproved comments:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Post;
 
$posts = Post::whereRelation('comments', 'is_approved', false)-&gt;get();</pre> <p>Of course, like calls to the query builder's <code>where</code> method, you may also specify an operator:</p> <pre data-language="php">$posts = Post::whereRelation(

)-&gt;get();</pre>  <h3 id="querying-relationship-absence">Querying Relationship Absence</h3> <p>When retrieving model records, you may wish to limit your results based on the absence of a relationship. For example, imagine you want to retrieve all blog posts that <strong>don't</strong> have any comments. To do so, you may pass the name of the relationship to the <code>doesntHave</code> and <code>orDoesntHave</code> methods:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Post;
 
$posts = Post::doesntHave('comments')-&gt;get();</pre> <p>If you need even more power, you may use the <code>whereDoesntHave</code> and <code>orWhereDoesntHave</code> methods to add additional query constraints to your <code>doesntHave</code> queries, such as inspecting the content of a comment:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
 
$posts = Post::whereDoesntHave('comments', function (Builder $query) {
    $query-&gt;where('content', 'like', 'code%');

These methods accept the name of the relationship as their first argument. Next, the methods accept the names of the related models that you wish to include in the query. Finally, you may provide a closure which customizes the relationship query:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Comment;

This means the relationship data is not actually loaded until you first access the property. However, Eloquent can "eager load" relationships at the time you query the parent model. Eager loading alleviates the "N + 1" query problem. To illustrate the N + 1 query problem, consider a <code>Book</code> model that "belongs to" to an <code>Author</code> model:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
 
class Book extends Model
{
    /**

     */
    public function author(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this-&gt;belongsTo(Author::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>Now, let's retrieve all books and their authors:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Book;
 
$books = Book::all();
 
foreach ($books as $book) {
    echo $book-&gt;author-&gt;name;
}</pre> <p>This loop will execute one query to retrieve all of the books within the database table, then another query for each book in order to retrieve the book's author. So, if we have 25 books, the code above would run 26 queries: one for the original book, and 25 additional queries to retrieve the author of each book.</p> <p>Thankfully, we can use eager loading to reduce this operation to just two queries. When building a query, you may specify which relationships should be eager loaded using the <code>with</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">$books = Book::with('author')-&gt;get();
 
foreach ($books as $book) {
    echo $book-&gt;author-&gt;name;
}</pre> <p>For this operation, only two queries will be executed - one query to retrieve all of the books and one query to retrieve all of the authors for all of the books:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="sql">select * from books

For example, let's eager load all of the book's authors and all of the author's personal contacts:</p> <pre data-language="php">$books = Book::with('author.contacts')-&gt;get();</pre> <p>Alternatively, you may specify nested eager loaded relationships by providing a nested array to the <code>with</code> method, which can be convenient when eager loading multiple nested relationships:</p> <pre data-language="php">$books = Book::with([

</svg> </div> </div> <p class="mb-0 lg:ml-6 callout"> When using this feature, you should always include the <code>id</code> column and any relevant foreign key columns in the list of columns you wish to retrieve.</p> </div>  <h4 id="eager-loading-by-default">Eager Loading by Default</h4> <p>Sometimes you might want to always load some relationships when retrieving a model. To accomplish this, you may define a <code>$with</code> property on the model:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
 
class Book extends Model
{
    /**
     * The relationships that should always be loaded.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $with = ['author'];
 
    /**
     * Get the author that wrote the book.
     */
    public function author(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this-&gt;belongsTo(Author::class);
    }
 
    /**
     * Get the genre of the book.
     */
    public function genre(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this-&gt;belongsTo(Genre::class);
    }
}</pre> <p>If you would like to remove an item from the <code>$with</code> property for a single query, you may use the <code>without</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">$books = Book::without('author')-&gt;get();</pre> <p>If you would like to override all items within the <code>$with</code> property for a single query, you may use the <code>withOnly</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">$books = Book::withOnly('genre')-&gt;get();</pre>  <h3 id="constraining-eager-loads">Constraining Eager Loads</h3> <p>Sometimes you may wish to eager load a relationship but also specify additional query conditions for the eager loading query. You can accomplish this by passing an array of relationships to the <code>with</code> method where the array key is a relationship name and the array value is a closure that adds additional constraints to the eager loading query:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
 
$users = User::with(['posts' =&gt; function (Builder $query) {
    $query-&gt;where('title', 'like', '%code%');
}])-&gt;get();</pre> <p>In this example, Eloquent will only eager load posts where the post's <code>title</code> column contains the word <code>code</code>. You may call other <a href="queries.html">query builder</a> methods to further customize the eager loading operation:</p> <pre data-language="php">$users = User::with(['posts' =&gt; function (Builder $query) {
    $query-&gt;orderBy('created_at', 'desc');
}])-&gt;get();</pre>  <h4 id="constraining-eager-loading-of-morph-to-relationships">Constraining Eager Loading of <code>morphTo</code> Relationships</h4> <p>If you are eager loading a <code>morphTo</code> relationship, Eloquent will run multiple queries to fetch each type of related model. You may add additional constraints to each of these queries using the <code>MorphTo</code> relation's <code>constrain</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphTo;
 
$comments = Comment::with(['commentable' =&gt; function (MorphTo $morphTo) {
    $morphTo-&gt;constrain([
        Post::class =&gt; function ($query) {
            $query-&gt;whereNull('hidden_at');
        },
        Video::class =&gt; function ($query) {
            $query-&gt;where('type', 'educational');
        },
    ]);
}])-&gt;get();</pre> <p>In this example, Eloquent will only eager load posts that have not been hidden and videos that have a <code>type</code> value of "educational".</p>  <h4 id="constraining-eager-loads-with-relationship-existence">Constraining Eager Loads With Relationship Existence</h4> <p>You may sometimes find yourself needing to check for the existence of a relationship while simultaneously loading the relationship based on the same conditions. For example, you may wish to only retrieve <code>User</code> models that have child <code>Post</code> models matching a given query condition while also eager loading the matching posts. You may accomplish this using the <code>withWhereHas</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\User;
 
$users = User::withWhereHas('posts', function ($query) {
    $query-&gt;where('featured', true);
})-&gt;get();</pre>  <h3 id="lazy-eager-loading">Lazy Eager Loading</h3> <p>Sometimes you may need to eager load a relationship after the parent model has already been retrieved. For example, this may be useful if you need to dynamically decide whether to load related models:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Book;
 
$books = Book::all();
 
if ($someCondition) {
    $books-&gt;load('author', 'publisher');
}</pre> <p>If you need to set additional query constraints on the eager loading query, you may pass an array keyed by the relationships you wish to load. The array values should be closure instances which receive the query instance:</p> <pre data-language="php">$author-&gt;load(['books' =&gt; function (Builder $query) {
    $query-&gt;orderBy('published_date', 'asc');
}]);</pre> <p>To load a relationship only when it has not already been loaded, use the <code>loadMissing</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">$book-&gt;loadMissing('author');</pre>  <h4 id="nested-lazy-eager-loading-morphto">Nested Lazy Eager Loading and <code>morphTo</code>
</h4> <p>If you would like to eager load a <code>morphTo</code> relationship, as well as nested relationships on the various entities that may be returned by that relationship, you may use the <code>loadMorph</code> method.</p> <p>This method accepts the name of the <code>morphTo</code> relationship as its first argument, and an array of model / relationship pairs as its second argument. To help illustrate this method, let's consider the following model:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphTo;
 
class ActivityFeed extends Model
{
    /**
     * Get the parent of the activity feed record.
     */
    public function parentable(): MorphTo
    {
        return $this-&gt;morphTo();
    }
}</pre> <p>In this example, let's assume <code>Event</code>, <code>Photo</code>, and <code>Post</code> models may create <code>ActivityFeed</code> models. Additionally, let's assume that <code>Event</code> models belong to a <code>Calendar</code> model, <code>Photo</code> models are associated with <code>Tag</code> models, and <code>Post</code> models belong to an <code>Author</code> model.</p> <p>Using these model definitions and relationships, we may retrieve <code>ActivityFeed</code> model instances and eager load all <code>parentable</code> models and their respective nested relationships:</p> <pre data-language="php">$activities = ActivityFeed::with('parentable')
    -&gt;get()
    -&gt;loadMorph('parentable', [
        Event::class =&gt; ['calendar'],
        Photo::class =&gt; ['tags'],
        Post::class =&gt; ['author'],
    ]);</pre>  <h3 id="preventing-lazy-loading">Preventing Lazy Loading</h3> <p>As previously discussed, eager loading relationships can often provide significant performance benefits to your application. Therefore, if you would like, you may instruct Laravel to always prevent the lazy loading of relationships. To accomplish this, you may invoke the <code>preventLazyLoading</code> method offered by the base Eloquent model class. Typically, you should call this method within the <code>boot</code> method of your application's <code>AppServiceProvider</code> class.</p> <p>The <code>preventLazyLoading</code> method accepts an optional boolean argument that indicates if lazy loading should be prevented. For example, you may wish to only disable lazy loading in non-production environments so that your production environment will continue to function normally even if a lazy loaded relationship is accidentally present in production code:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
 
/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Model::preventLazyLoading(! $this-&gt;app-&gt;isProduction());
}</pre> </div> <p>After preventing lazy loading, Eloquent will throw a <code>Illuminate\Database\LazyLoadingViolationException</code> exception when your application attempts to lazy load any Eloquent relationship.</p> <p>You may customize the behavior of lazy loading violations using the <code>handleLazyLoadingViolationsUsing</code> method. For example, using this method, you may instruct lazy loading violations to only be logged instead of interrupting the application's execution with exceptions:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">Model::handleLazyLoadingViolationUsing(function (Model $model, string $relation) {
    $class = $model::class;
 
    info("Attempted to lazy load [{$relation}] on model [{$class}].");
});</pre> </div>  <h2 id="inserting-and-updating-related-models">Inserting and Updating Related Models</h2>  <h3 id="the-save-method">The <code>save</code> Method</h3> <p>Eloquent provides convenient methods for adding new models to relationships. For example, perhaps you need to add a new comment to a post. Instead of manually setting the <code>post_id</code> attribute on the <code>Comment</code> model you may insert the comment using the relationship's <code>save</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Comment;
use App\Models\Post;
 
$comment = new Comment(['message' =&gt; 'A new comment.']);
 
$post = Post::find(1);
 
$post-&gt;comments()-&gt;save($comment);</pre> <p>Note that we did not access the <code>comments</code> relationship as a dynamic property. Instead, we called the <code>comments</code> method to obtain an instance of the relationship. The <code>save</code> method will automatically add the appropriate <code>post_id</code> value to the new <code>Comment</code> model.</p> <p>If you need to save multiple related models, you may use the <code>saveMany</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">$post = Post::find(1);
 
$post-&gt;comments()-&gt;saveMany([
    new Comment(['message' =&gt; 'A new comment.']),
    new Comment(['message' =&gt; 'Another new comment.']),
]);</pre> <p>The <code>save</code> and <code>saveMany</code> methods will persist the given model instances, but will not add the newly persisted models to any in-memory relationships that are already loaded onto the parent model. If you plan on accessing the relationship after using the <code>save</code> or <code>saveMany</code> methods, you may wish to use the <code>refresh</code> method to reload the model and its relationships:</p> <pre data-language="php">$post-&gt;comments()-&gt;save($comment);
 
$post-&gt;refresh();
 
// All comments, including the newly saved comment...
$post-&gt;comments;</pre>  <h4 id="the-push-method">Recursively Saving Models and Relationships</h4> <p>If you would like to <code>save</code> your model and all of its associated relationships, you may use the <code>push</code> method. In this example, the <code>Post</code> model will be saved as well as its comments and the comment's authors:</p> <pre data-language="php">$post = Post::find(1);
 
$post-&gt;comments[0]-&gt;message = 'Message';
$post-&gt;comments[0]-&gt;author-&gt;name = 'Author Name';
 
$post-&gt;push();</pre> <p>The <code>pushQuietly</code> method may be used to save a model and its associated relationships without raising any events:</p> <pre data-language="php">$post-&gt;pushQuietly();</pre>  <h3 id="the-create-method">The <code>create</code> Method</h3> <p>In addition to the <code>save</code> and <code>saveMany</code> methods, you may also use the <code>create</code> method, which accepts an array of attributes, creates a model, and inserts it into the database. The difference between <code>save</code> and <code>create</code> is that <code>save</code> accepts a full Eloquent model instance while <code>create</code> accepts a plain PHP <code>array</code>. The newly created model will be returned by the <code>create</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Post;
 
$post = Post::find(1);
 
$comment = $post-&gt;comments()-&gt;create([
    'message' =&gt; 'A new comment.',
]);</pre> <p>You may use the <code>createMany</code> method to create multiple related models:</p> <pre data-language="php">$post = Post::find(1);
 
$post-&gt;comments()-&gt;createMany([
    ['message' =&gt; 'A new comment.'],
    ['message' =&gt; 'Another new comment.'],
]);</pre> <p>The <code>createQuietly</code> and <code>createManyQuietly</code> methods may be used to create a model(s) without dispatching any events:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user = User::find(1);
 
$user-&gt;posts()-&gt;createQuietly([
    'title' =&gt; 'Post title.',
]);
 
$user-&gt;posts()-&gt;createManyQuietly([
    ['title' =&gt; 'First post.'],
    ['title' =&gt; 'Second post.'],
]);</pre> <p>You may also use the <code>findOrNew</code>, <code>firstOrNew</code>, <code>firstOrCreate</code>, and <code>updateOrCreate</code> methods to <a href="eloquent.html#upserts">create and update models on relationships</a>.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>

In this example, the <code>User</code> model defines a <code>belongsTo</code> relationship to the <code>Account</code> model. This <code>associate</code> method will set the foreign key on the child model:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\Account;
 
$account = Account::find(10);
 
$user-&gt;account()-&gt;associate($account);
 
$user-&gt;save();</pre> <p>To remove a parent model from a child model, you may use the <code>dissociate</code> method. This method will set the relationship's foreign key to <code>null</code>:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user-&gt;account()-&gt;dissociate();
 
$user-&gt;save();</pre>  <h3 id="updating-many-to-many-relationships">Many to Many Relationships</h3>  <h4 id="attaching-detaching">Attaching / Detaching</h4> <p>Eloquent also provides methods to make working with many-to-many relationships more convenient. For example, let's imagine a user can have many roles and a role can have many users. You may use the <code>attach</code> method to attach a role to a user by inserting a record in the relationship's intermediate table:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Models\User;
 
$user = User::find(1);
 
$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;attach($roleId);</pre> <p>When attaching a relationship to a model, you may also pass an array of additional data to be inserted into the intermediate table:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;attach($roleId, ['expires' =&gt; $expires]);</pre> <p>Sometimes it may be necessary to remove a role from a user. To remove a many-to-many relationship record, use the <code>detach</code> method. The <code>detach</code> method will delete the appropriate record out of the intermediate table; however, both models will remain in the database:</p> <pre data-language="php">// Detach a single role from the user...
$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;detach($roleId);
 
// Detach all roles from the user...
$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;detach();</pre> <p>For convenience, <code>attach</code> and <code>detach</code> also accept arrays of IDs as input:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user = User::find(1);
 
$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;detach([1, 2, 3]);
 
$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;attach([
    1 =&gt; ['expires' =&gt; $expires],
    2 =&gt; ['expires' =&gt; $expires],
]);</pre>  <h4 id="syncing-associations">Syncing Associations</h4> <p>You may also use the <code>sync</code> method to construct many-to-many associations. The <code>sync</code> method accepts an array of IDs to place on the intermediate table. Any IDs that are not in the given array will be removed from the intermediate table. So, after this operation is complete, only the IDs in the given array will exist in the intermediate table:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;sync([1, 2, 3]);</pre> <p>You may also pass additional intermediate table values with the IDs:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;sync([1 =&gt; ['expires' =&gt; true], 2, 3]);</pre> <p>If you would like to insert the same intermediate table values with each of the synced model IDs, you may use the <code>syncWithPivotValues</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;syncWithPivotValues([1, 2, 3], ['active' =&gt; true]);</pre> <p>If you do not want to detach existing IDs that are missing from the given array, you may use the <code>syncWithoutDetaching</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;syncWithoutDetaching([1, 2, 3]);</pre>  <h4 id="toggling-associations">Toggling Associations</h4> <p>The many-to-many relationship also provides a <code>toggle</code> method which "toggles" the attachment status of the given related model IDs. If the given ID is currently attached, it will be detached. Likewise, if it is currently detached, it will be attached:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;toggle([1, 2, 3]);</pre> <p>You may also pass additional intermediate table values with the IDs:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;toggle([
    1 =&gt; ['expires' =&gt; true],
    2 =&gt; ['expires' =&gt; true],
]);</pre>  <h4 id="updating-a-record-on-the-intermediate-table">Updating a Record on the Intermediate Table</h4> <p>If you need to update an existing row in your relationship's intermediate table, you may use the <code>updateExistingPivot</code> method. This method accepts the intermediate record foreign key and an array of attributes to update:</p> <pre data-language="php">$user = User::find(1);
 
$user-&gt;roles()-&gt;updateExistingPivot($roleId, [
    'active' =&gt; false,
]);</pre>  <h2 id="touching-parent-timestamps">Touching Parent Timestamps</h2> <p>When a model defines a <code>belongsTo</code> or <code>belongsToMany</code> relationship to another model, such as a <code>Comment</code> which belongs to a <code>Post</code>, it is sometimes helpful to update the parent's timestamp when the child model is updated.</p> <p>For example, when a <code>Comment</code> model is updated, you may want to automatically "touch" the <code>updated_at</code> timestamp of the owning <code>Post</code> so that it is set to the current date and time. To accomplish this, you may add a <code>touches</code> property to your child model containing the names of the relationships that should have their <code>updated_at</code> timestamps updated when the child model is updated:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
 
class Comment extends Model
{
    /**
     * All of the relationships to be touched.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $touches = ['post'];
 
    /**
     * Get the post that the comment belongs to.
     */
    public function post(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this-&gt;belongsTo(Post::class);
    }
