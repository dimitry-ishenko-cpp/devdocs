Check out the <a href="https://bootcamp.laravel.com">Laravel Bootcamp</a> for a hands-on tour of the framework while we walk you through building your first Laravel application.</p> </div>  <h3 id="why-laravel">Why Laravel?</h3> <p>There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.</p> <h4>A Progressive Framework</h4> <p>We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean that Laravel grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps into web development, Laravel's vast library of documentation, guides, and <a href="https://laracasts.com">video tutorials</a> will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.</p> <p>If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for <a href="container.html">dependency injection</a>, <a href="testing.html">unit testing</a>, <a href="queues.html">queues</a>, <a href="broadcasting.html">real-time events</a>, and more. Laravel is fine-tuned for building professional web applications and ready to handle enterprise work loads.</p> <h4>A Scalable Framework</h4> <p>Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and Laravel's built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze. In fact, Laravel applications have been easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.</p> <p>Need extreme scaling? Platforms like <a href="https://vapor.laravel.com">Laravel Vapor</a> allow you to run your Laravel application at nearly limitless scale on AWS's latest serverless technology.</p> <h4>A Community Framework</h4> <p>Laravel combines the best packages in the PHP ecosystem to offer the most robust and developer friendly framework available. In addition, thousands of talented developers from around the world have <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework">contributed to the framework</a>. Who knows, maybe you'll even become a Laravel contributor.</p>  <h2 id="creating-a-laravel-project">Creating a Laravel Project</h2> <p>Before creating your first Laravel project, make sure that your local machine has PHP and <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> installed. If you are developing on macOS or Windows, PHP, Composer, Node and NPM can be installed in minutes via <a href="#local-installation-using-herd">Laravel Herd</a>.</p> <p>After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via Composer's <code>create-project</code> command:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre>composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app</pre> </div> <p>Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing <a href="https://github.com/laravel/installer">the Laravel installer</a> via Composer. The Laravel installer allows you to select your preferred testing framework, database, and starter kit when creating new applications:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre>composer global require laravel/installer
 
laravel new example-app</pre> </div> <p>Once the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using Laravel Artisan's <code>serve</code> command:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre>cd example-app
 
php artisan serve</pre> </div> <p>Once you have started the Artisan development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a>. Next, you're ready to <a href="#next-steps">start taking your next steps into the Laravel ecosystem</a>. Of course, you may also want to <a href="#databases-and-migrations">configure a database</a>.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>

Each option is documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.</p> <p>Laravel needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review the <code>config/app.php</code> file and its documentation. It contains several options such as <code>timezone</code> and <code>locale</code> that you may wish to change according to your application.</p>  <h3 id="environment-based-configuration">Environment Based Configuration</h3> <p>Since many of Laravel's configuration option values may vary depending on whether your application is running on your local machine or on a production web server, many important configuration values are defined using the <code>.env</code> file that exists at the root of your application.</p> <p>Your <code>.env</code> file should not be committed to your application's source control, since each developer / server using your application could require a different environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event an intruder gains access to your source control repository, since any sensitive credentials would be exposed.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>

By default, your application's <code>.env</code> configuration file specifies that Laravel will be interacting with a SQLite database.</p> <p>During the creation of the project, Laravel created a <code>database/database.sqlite</code> file for you, and ran the necessary migrations to create the application's database tables.</p> <p>If you prefer to use another database driver such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, you can update your <code>.env</code> configuration file to use the appropriate database. For example, if you wish to use MySQL, update your <code>.env</code> configuration file's <code>DB_*</code> variables like so:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="ini">DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=</pre> </div> <p>If you choose to use a database other than SQLite, you will need to create the database and run your application's <a href="migrations.html">database migrations</a>:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan migrate</pre> </div> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>

The installer automatically downloads the latest version of PHP and configures your Mac to always run <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a> in the background.</p> <p>Herd for macOS uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq">dnsmasq</a> to support "parked" directories. Any Laravel application in a parked directory will automatically be served by Herd. By default, Herd creates a parked directory at <code>~/Herd</code> and you can access any Laravel application in this directory on the <code>.test</code> domain using its directory name.</p> <p>After installing Herd, the fastest way to create a new Laravel project is using the Laravel CLI, which is bundled with Herd:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre>cd ~/Herd
laravel new my-app
cd my-app
herd open</pre> </div> <p>Of course, you can always manage your parked directories and other PHP settings via Herd's UI, which can be opened from the Herd menu in your system tray.</p> <p>You can learn more about Herd by checking out the <a href="https://herd.laravel.com/docs">Herd documentation</a>.</p>  <h3 id="herd-on-windows">Herd on Windows</h3> <p>You can download the Windows installer for Herd on the <a href="https://herd.laravel.com/windows">Herd website</a>. After the installation finishes, you can start Herd to complete the onboarding process and access the Herd UI for the first time.</p> <p>The Herd UI is accessible by left-clicking on Herd's system tray icon. A right-click opens the quick menu with access to all tools that you need on a daily basis.</p> <p>During installation, Herd creates a "parked" directory in your home directory at <code>%USERPROFILE%\Herd</code>. Any Laravel application in a parked directory will automatically be served by Herd, and you can access any Laravel application in this directory on the <code>.test</code> domain using its directory name.</p> <p>After installing Herd, the fastest way to create a new Laravel project is using the Laravel CLI, which is bundled with Herd. To get started, open Powershell and run the following commands:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre>cd ~\Herd

So, there are a variety of options for developing and running a Laravel project on your local machine. While you may wish to explore these options at a later time, Laravel provides <a href="sail.html">Sail</a>, a built-in solution for running your Laravel project using <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a>.</p> <p>Docker is a tool for running applications and services in small, light-weight "containers" which do not interfere with your local machine's installed software or configuration. This means you don't have to worry about configuring or setting up complicated development tools such as web servers and databases on your local machine. To get started, you only need to install <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker Desktop</a>.</p> <p>Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration.

These packages allow you to use Laravel as a full-stack framework while enjoying many of the UI benefits provided by single-page JavaScript applications.</p> <p>If you are using Laravel as a full stack framework, we also strongly encourage you to learn how to compile your application's CSS and JavaScript using <a href="vite.html">Vite</a>.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>

For example, you might use Laravel as an API backend for your <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a> application. In this context, you may use Laravel to provide <a href="sanctum.html">authentication</a> and data storage / retrieval for your application, while also taking advantage of Laravel's powerful services such as queues, emails, notifications, and more.</p> <p>If this is how you plan to use Laravel, you may want to check out our documentation on <a href="routing.html">routing</a>, <a href="sanctum.html">Laravel Sanctum</a>, and the <a href="eloquent.html">Eloquent ORM</a>.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>
