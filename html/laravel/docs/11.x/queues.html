Thankfully, Laravel allows you to easily create queued jobs that may be processed in the background. By moving time intensive tasks to a queue, your application can respond to web requests with blazing speed and provide a better user experience to your customers.</p> <p>Laravel queues provide a unified queueing API across a variety of different queue backends, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon SQS</a>, <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a>, or even a relational database.</p> <p>Laravel's queue configuration options are stored in your application's <code>config/queue.php</code> configuration file. In this file, you will find connection configurations for each of the queue drivers that are included with the framework, including the database, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon SQS</a>, <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a>, and <a href="https://beanstalkd.github.io/">Beanstalkd</a> drivers, as well as a synchronous driver that will execute jobs immediately (for use during local development). A <code>null</code> queue driver is also included which discards queued jobs.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>
</svg></div> </div> <p class="mb-0 lg:ml-6 callout"> Laravel now offers Horizon, a beautiful dashboard and configuration system for your Redis powered queues. Check out the full <a href="horizon.html">Horizon documentation</a> for more information.</p> </div>  <h3 id="connections-vs-queues">Connections vs. Queues</h3> <p>Before getting started with Laravel queues, it is important to understand the distinction between "connections" and "queues". In your <code>config/queue.php</code> configuration file, there is a <code>connections</code> configuration array. This option defines the connections to backend queue services such as Amazon SQS, Beanstalk, or Redis. However, any given queue connection may have multiple "queues" which may be thought of as different stacks or piles of queued jobs.</p> <p>Note that each connection configuration example in the <code>queue</code> configuration file contains a <code>queue</code> attribute. This is the default queue that jobs will be dispatched to when they are sent to a given connection. In other words, if you dispatch a job without explicitly defining which queue it should be dispatched to, the job will be placed on the queue that is defined in the <code>queue</code> attribute of the connection configuration:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast;
 
// This job is sent to the default connection's default queue...
ProcessPodcast::dispatch();
 
// This job is sent to the default connection's "emails" queue...
ProcessPodcast::dispatch()-&gt;onQueue('emails');</pre> <p>Some applications may not need to ever push jobs onto multiple queues, instead preferring to have one simple queue. However, pushing jobs to multiple queues can be especially useful for applications that wish to prioritize or segment how jobs are processed, since the Laravel queue worker allows you to specify which queues it should process by priority. For example, if you push jobs to a <code>high</code> queue, you may run a worker that gives them higher processing priority:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --queue=high,default</pre> </div>  <h3 id="driver-prerequisites">Driver Notes and Prerequisites</h3>  <h4 id="database">Database</h4> <p>In order to use the <code>database</code> queue driver, you will need a database table to hold the jobs. Typically, this is included in Laravel's default <code>0001_01_01_000002_create_jobs_table.php</code> <a href="migrations.html">database migration</a>; however, if your application does not contain this migration, you may use the <code>make:queue-table</code> Artisan command to create it:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan make:queue-table
 
php artisan migrate</pre> </div>  <h4 id="redis">Redis</h4> <p>In order to use the <code>redis</code> queue driver, you should configure a Redis database connection in your <code>config/database.php</code> configuration file.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-red-600"> <div class="opacity-75">

This is required in order to ensure all of the Redis keys for a given queue are placed into the same hash slot:</p> <pre data-language="php">'redis' =&gt; [

    'after_commit' =&gt; false,
],</pre> <p><strong>Blocking</strong></p> <p>When using the Redis queue, you may use the <code>block_for</code> configuration option to specify how long the driver should wait for a job to become available before iterating through the worker loop and re-polling the Redis database.</p> <p>Adjusting this value based on your queue load can be more efficient than continually polling the Redis database for new jobs. For instance, you may set the value to <code>5</code> to indicate that the driver should block for five seconds while waiting for a job to become available:</p> <pre data-language="php">'redis' =&gt; [
    'driver' =&gt; 'redis',
    'connection' =&gt; env('REDIS_QUEUE_CONNECTION', 'default'),

To get started, let's take a look at an example job class. In this example, we'll pretend we manage a podcast publishing service and need to process the uploaded podcast files before they are published:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Jobs;
 
use App\Models\Podcast;
use App\Services\AudioProcessor;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Queue\Queueable;
 
class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Queueable;
 
    /**
     * Create a new job instance.
     */
    public function __construct(
        public Podcast $podcast,
    ) {}
 
    /**
     * Execute the job.
     */
    public function handle(AudioProcessor $processor): void
    {
        // Process uploaded podcast...
    }
}</pre> <p>In this example, note that we were able to pass an <a href="eloquent.html">Eloquent model</a> directly into the queued job's constructor. Because of the <code>Queueable</code> trait that the job is using, Eloquent models and their loaded relationships will be gracefully serialized and unserialized when the job is processing.</p> <p>If your queued job accepts an Eloquent model in its constructor, only the identifier for the model will be serialized onto the queue. When the job is actually handled, the queue system will automatically re-retrieve the full model instance and its loaded relationships from the database. This approach to model serialization allows for much smaller job payloads to be sent to your queue driver.</p>  <h4 id="handle-method-dependency-injection">
<code>handle</code> Method Dependency Injection</h4> <p>The <code>handle</code> method is invoked when the job is processed by the queue. Note that we are able to type-hint dependencies on the <code>handle</code> method of the job. The Laravel <a href="container.html">service container</a> automatically injects these dependencies.</p> <p>If you would like to take total control over how the container injects dependencies into the <code>handle</code> method, you may use the container's <code>bindMethod</code> method. The <code>bindMethod</code> method accepts a callback which receives the job and the container. Within the callback, you are free to invoke the <code>handle</code> method however you wish. Typically, you should call this method from the <code>boot</code> method of your <code>App\Providers\AppServiceProvider</code> <a href="providers.html">service provider</a>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast;
use App\Services\AudioProcessor;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application;
 
$this-&gt;app-&gt;bindMethod([ProcessPodcast::class, 'handle'], function (ProcessPodcast $job, Application $app) {
    return $job-&gt;handle($app-&gt;make(AudioProcessor::class));
});</pre> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-red-600"> <div class="opacity-75">

</svg> </div> </div> <p class="mb-0 lg:ml-6 callout"> Binary data, such as raw image contents, should be passed through the <code>base64_encode</code> function before being passed to a queued job. Otherwise, the job may not properly serialize to JSON when being placed on the queue.</p> </div>  <h4 id="handling-relationships">Queued Relationships</h4> <p>Because all loaded Eloquent model relationships also get serialized when a job is queued, the serialized job string can sometimes become quite large. Furthermore, when a job is deserialized and model relationships are re-retrieved from the database, they will be retrieved in their entirety. Any previous relationship constraints that were applied before the model was serialized during the job queueing process will not be applied when the job is deserialized. Therefore, if you wish to work with a subset of a given relationship, you should re-constrain that relationship within your queued job.</p> <p>Or, to prevent relations from being serialized, you can call the <code>withoutRelations</code> method on the model when setting a property value. This method will return an instance of the model without its loaded relationships:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Create a new job instance.
 */
public function __construct(Podcast $podcast)
{
    $this-&gt;podcast = $podcast-&gt;withoutRelations();
}</pre> <p>If you are using PHP constructor property promotion and would like to indicate that an Eloquent model should not have its relations serialized, you may use the <code>WithoutRelations</code> attribute:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Attributes\WithoutRelations;
 
/**
 * Create a new job instance.
 */
public function __construct(
    #[WithoutRelations]
    public Podcast $podcast
) {
}</pre> <p>If a job receives a collection or array of Eloquent models instead of a single model, the models within that collection will not have their relationships restored when the job is deserialized and executed. This is to prevent excessive resource usage on jobs that deal with large numbers of models.</p>  <h3 id="unique-jobs">Unique Jobs</h3> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-red-600"> <div class="opacity-75">

Currently, the <code>memcached</code>, <code>redis</code>, <code>dynamodb</code>, <code>database</code>, <code>file</code>, and <code>array</code> cache drivers support atomic locks. In addition, unique job constraints do not apply to jobs within batches.</p> </div> <p>Sometimes, you may want to ensure that only one instance of a specific job is on the queue at any point in time. You may do so by implementing the <code>ShouldBeUnique</code> interface on your job class. This interface does not require you to define any additional methods on your class:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeUnique;

To accomplish this, you may define <code>uniqueId</code> and <code>uniqueFor</code> properties or methods on your job class:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

However, there may be situations where you would like your job to unlock immediately before it is processed. To accomplish this, your job should implement the <code>ShouldBeUniqueUntilProcessing</code> contract instead of the <code>ShouldBeUnique</code> contract:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
use App\Models\Product;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

If the lock is not acquired, the job is not dispatched. This lock is released when the job completes processing or fails all of its retry attempts. By default, Laravel will use the default cache driver to obtain this lock. However, if you wish to use another driver for acquiring the lock, you may define a <code>uniqueVia</code> method that returns the cache driver that should be used:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;
 
class UpdateSearchIndex implements ShouldQueue, ShouldBeUnique
{
    ...
 
    /**

To get started, simply add the <code>ShouldBeEncrypted</code> interface to the job class. Once this interface has been added to the class, Laravel will automatically encrypt your job before pushing it onto a queue:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

}</pre>  <h2 id="job-middleware">Job Middleware</h2> <p>Job middleware allow you to wrap custom logic around the execution of queued jobs, reducing boilerplate in the jobs themselves. For example, consider the following <code>handle</code> method which leverages Laravel's Redis rate limiting features to allow only one job to process every five seconds:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis;
 
/**
 * Execute the job.
 */
public function handle(): void
{
    Redis::throttle('key')-&gt;block(0)-&gt;allow(1)-&gt;every(5)-&gt;then(function () {
        info('Lock obtained...');
 
        // Handle job...
    }, function () {
        // Could not obtain lock...
 
        return $this-&gt;release(5);
    });
}</pre> <p>While this code is valid, the implementation of the <code>handle</code> method becomes noisy since it is cluttered with Redis rate limiting logic. In addition, this rate limiting logic must be duplicated for any other jobs that we want to rate limit.</p> <p>Instead of rate limiting in the handle method, we could define a job middleware that handles rate limiting. Laravel does not have a default location for job middleware, so you are welcome to place job middleware anywhere in your application. In this example, we will place the middleware in an <code>app/Jobs/Middleware</code> directory:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Jobs\Middleware;
 
use Closure;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis;
 
class RateLimited
{
    /**
     * Process the queued job.

                    // Could not obtain lock...
 
                    $job-&gt;release(5);
                });
    }
}</pre> <p>As you can see, like <a href="middleware.html">route middleware</a>, job middleware receive the job being processed and a callback that should be invoked to continue processing the job.</p> <p>After creating job middleware, they may be attached to a job by returning them from the job's <code>middleware</code> method. This method does not exist on jobs scaffolded by the <code>make:job</code> Artisan command, so you will need to manually add it to your job class:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\Middleware\RateLimited;
 
/**

Like <a href="routing.html#defining-rate-limiters">route rate limiters</a>, job rate limiters are defined using the <code>RateLimiter</code> facade's <code>for</code> method.</p> <p>For example, you may wish to allow users to backup their data once per hour while imposing no such limit on premium customers. To accomplish this, you may define a <code>RateLimiter</code> in the <code>boot</code> method of your <code>AppServiceProvider</code>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Cache\RateLimiting\Limit;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;
 
/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    RateLimiter::for('backups', function (object $job) {
        return $job-&gt;user-&gt;vipCustomer()
                    ? Limit::none()
                    : Limit::perHour(1)-&gt;by($job-&gt;user-&gt;id);
    });
}</pre> <p>In the example above, we defined an hourly rate limit; however, you may easily define a rate limit based on minutes using the <code>perMinute</code> method. In addition, you may pass any value you wish to the <code>by</code> method of the rate limit; however, this value is most often used to segment rate limits by customer:</p> <pre data-language="php">return Limit::perMinute(50)-&gt;by($job-&gt;user-&gt;id);</pre> <p>Once you have defined your rate limit, you may attach the rate limiter to your job using the <code>Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\RateLimited</code> middleware. Each time the job exceeds the rate limit, this middleware will release the job back to the queue with an appropriate delay based on the rate limit duration.</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\RateLimited;

}</pre> <p>Releasing a rate limited job back onto the queue will still increment the job's total number of <code>attempts</code>. You may wish to tune your <code>tries</code> and <code>maxExceptions</code> properties on your job class accordingly. Or, you may wish to use the <a href="#time-based-attempts"><code>retryUntil</code> method</a> to define the amount of time until the job should no longer be attempted.</p> <p>If you do not want a job to be retried when it is rate limited, you may use the <code>dontRelease</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**

This can be helpful when a queued job is modifying a resource that should only be modified by one job at a time.</p> <p>For example, let's imagine you have a queued job that updates a user's credit score and you want to prevent credit score update job overlaps for the same user ID. To accomplish this, you can return the <code>WithoutOverlapping</code> middleware from your job's <code>middleware</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\WithoutOverlapping;

 */
public function middleware(): array
{
    return [(new WithoutOverlapping($this-&gt;order-&gt;id))-&gt;dontRelease()];
}</pre> <p>The <code>WithoutOverlapping</code> middleware is powered by Laravel's atomic lock feature. Sometimes, your job may unexpectedly fail or timeout in such a way that the lock is not released. Therefore, you may explicitly define a lock expiration time using the <code>expireAfter</code> method. For example, the example below will instruct Laravel to release the <code>WithoutOverlapping</code> lock three minutes after the job has started processing:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * Get the middleware the job should pass through.
 *
 * @return array&lt;int, object&gt;

So, although two different job classes may use the same lock key, they will not be prevented from overlapping. However, you can instruct Laravel to apply the key across job classes using the <code>shared</code> method:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\WithoutOverlapping;

    }
}</pre> </div>  <h3 id="throttling-exceptions">Throttling Exceptions</h3> <p>Laravel includes a <code>Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\ThrottlesExceptions</code> middleware that allows you to throttle exceptions. Once the job throws a given number of exceptions, all further attempts to execute the job are delayed until a specified time interval lapses. This middleware is particularly useful for jobs that interact with third-party services that are unstable.</p> <p>For example, let's imagine a queued job that interacts with a third-party API that begins throwing exceptions. To throttle exceptions, you can return the <code>ThrottlesExceptions</code> middleware from your job's <code>middleware</code> method. Typically, this middleware should be paired with a job that implements <a href="#time-based-attempts">time based attempts</a>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use DateTime;
use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\ThrottlesExceptions;
 
/**
 * Get the middleware the job should pass through.
 *
 * @return array&lt;int, object&gt;
 */
public function middleware(): array
{
    return [new ThrottlesExceptions(10, 5)];
}
 
/**
 * Determine the time at which the job should timeout.
 */
public function retryUntil(): DateTime
{
    return now()-&gt;addMinutes(5);
}</pre> <p>The first constructor argument accepted by the middleware is the number of exceptions the job can throw before being throttled, while the second constructor argument is the number of minutes that should elapse before the job is attempted again once it has been throttled. In the code example above, if the job throws 10 exceptions within 5 minutes, we will wait 5 minutes before attempting the job again.</p> <p>When a job throws an exception but the exception threshold has not yet been reached, the job will typically be retried immediately. However, you may specify the number of minutes such a job should be delayed by calling the <code>backoff</code> method when attaching the middleware to the job:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\ThrottlesExceptions;
 
/**
 * Get the middleware the job should pass through.
 *
 * @return array&lt;int, object&gt;
 */
public function middleware(): array
{
    return [(new ThrottlesExceptions(10, 5))-&gt;backoff(5)];
}</pre> <p>Internally, this middleware uses Laravel's cache system to implement rate limiting, and the job's class name is utilized as the cache "key". You may override this key by calling the <code>by</code> method when attaching the middleware to your job. This may be useful if you have multiple jobs interacting with the same third-party service and you would like them to share a common throttling "bucket":</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\ThrottlesExceptions;
 
/**
 * Get the middleware the job should pass through.
 *
 * @return array&lt;int, object&gt;
 */
public function middleware(): array
{
    return [(new ThrottlesExceptions(10, 10))-&gt;by('key')];
}</pre> <p>By default, this middleware will throttle every exception. You can modify this behaviour by invoking the <code>when</code> method when attaching the middleware to your job. The exception will then only be throttled if closure provided to the <code>when</code> method returns <code>true</code>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Http\Client\HttpClientException;
use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\ThrottlesExceptions;
 
/**
 * Get the middleware the job should pass through.

public function middleware(): array
{
    return [(new ThrottlesExceptions(10, 10))-&gt;when(
        fn (Throwable $throwable) =&gt; $throwable instanceof HttpClientException
    )];
}</pre> <p>If you would like to have the throttled exceptions reported to your application's exception handler, you can do so by invoking the <code>report</code> method when attaching the middleware to your job. Optionally, you may provide a closure to the <code>report</code> method and the exception will only be reported if the given closure returns <code>true</code>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Http\Client\HttpClientException;

This will still allow the user to begin using the application even though a queued job is still executing. This should typically only be used for jobs that take about a second, such as sending an email. Since they are processed within the current HTTP request, jobs dispatched in this fashion do not require a queue worker to be running in order for them to be processed:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\SendNotification;

}</pre>  <h3 id="jobs-and-database-transactions">Jobs &amp; Database Transactions</h3> <p>While it is perfectly fine to dispatch jobs within database transactions, you should take special care to ensure that your job will actually be able to execute successfully. When dispatching a job within a transaction, it is possible that the job will be processed by a worker before the parent transaction has committed. When this happens, any updates you have made to models or database records during the database transaction(s) may not yet be reflected in the database. In addition, any models or database records created within the transaction(s) may not exist in the database.</p> <p>Thankfully, Laravel provides several methods of working around this problem. First, you may set the <code>after_commit</code> connection option in your queue connection's configuration array:</p> <pre data-language="php">'redis' =&gt; [
    'driver' =&gt; 'redis',
    // ...
    'after_commit' =&gt; true,
],</pre> <p>When the <code>after_commit</code> option is <code>true</code>, you may dispatch jobs within database transactions; however, Laravel will wait until the open parent database transactions have been committed before actually dispatching the job. Of course, if no database transactions are currently open, the job will be dispatched immediately.</p> <p>If a transaction is rolled back due to an exception that occurs during the transaction, the jobs that were dispatched during that transaction will be discarded.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>

To accomplish this, you may chain the <code>afterCommit</code> method onto your dispatch operation:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast;
 
ProcessPodcast::dispatch($podcast)-&gt;afterCommit();</pre> <p>Likewise, if the <code>after_commit</code> configuration option is set to <code>true</code>, you may indicate that a specific job should be dispatched immediately without waiting for any open database transactions to commit:</p> <pre data-language="php">ProcessPodcast::dispatch($podcast)-&gt;beforeCommit();</pre>  <h3 id="job-chaining">Job Chaining</h3> <p>Job chaining allows you to specify a list of queued jobs that should be run in sequence after the primary job has executed successfully. If one job in the sequence fails, the rest of the jobs will not be run. To execute a queued job chain, you may use the <code>chain</code> method provided by the <code>Bus</code> facade. Laravel's command bus is a lower level component that queued job dispatching is built on top of:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\OptimizePodcast;

Therefore, Laravel provides various ways to specify how many times or for how long a job may be attempted.</p> <p>One approach to specifying the maximum number of times a job may be attempted is via the <code>--tries</code> switch on the Artisan command line. This will apply to all jobs processed by the worker unless the job being processed specifies the number of times it may be attempted:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --tries=3</pre> </div> <p>If a job exceeds its maximum number of attempts, it will be considered a "failed" job. For more information on handling failed jobs, consult the <a href="#dealing-with-failed-jobs">failed job documentation</a>. If <code>--tries=0</code> is provided to the <code>queue:work</code> command, the job will be retried indefinitely.</p> <p>You may take a more granular approach by defining the maximum number of times a job may be attempted on the job class itself. If the maximum number of attempts is specified on the job, it will take precedence over the <code>--tries</code> value provided on the command line:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

 */
public function tries(): int
{
    return 5;
}</pre>  <h4 id="time-based-attempts">Time Based Attempts</h4> <p>As an alternative to defining how many times a job may be attempted before it fails, you may define a time at which the job should no longer be attempted. This allows a job to be attempted any number of times within a given time frame. To define the time at which a job should no longer be attempted, add a <code>retryUntil</code> method to your job class. This method should return a <code>DateTime</code> instance:</p> <pre data-language="php">use DateTime;

For this reason, Laravel allows you to specify a "timeout" value. By default, the timeout value is 60 seconds.

Typically, the worker will be restarted automatically by a <a href="#supervisor-configuration">process manager configured on your server</a>.</p> <p>The maximum number of seconds that jobs can run may be specified using the <code>--timeout</code> switch on the Artisan command line:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --timeout=30</pre> </div> <p>If the job exceeds its maximum attempts by continually timing out, it will be marked as failed.</p> <p>You may also define the maximum number of seconds a job should be allowed to run on the job class itself.

}</pre> <p>Sometimes, IO blocking processes such as sockets or outgoing HTTP connections may not respect your specified timeout. Therefore, when using these features, you should always attempt to specify a timeout using their APIs as well.

This migration may be generated using the <code>make:queue-batches-table</code> Artisan command:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan make:queue-batches-table
 
php artisan migrate</pre> </div>  <h3 id="defining-batchable-jobs">Defining Batchable Jobs</h3> <p>To define a batchable job, you should <a href="#creating-jobs">create a queueable job</a> as normal; however, you should add the <code>Illuminate\Bus\Batchable</code> trait to the job class.

    }
}</pre>  <h3 id="dispatching-batches">Dispatching Batches</h3> <p>To dispatch a batch of jobs, you should use the <code>batch</code> method of the <code>Bus</code> facade. Of course, batching is primarily useful when combined with completion callbacks. So, you may use the <code>then</code>, <code>catch</code>, and <code>finally</code> methods to define completion callbacks for the batch. Each of these callbacks will receive an <code>Illuminate\Bus\Batch</code> instance when they are invoked. In this example, we will imagine we are queueing a batch of jobs that each process a given number of rows from a CSV file:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\ImportCsv;
use Illuminate\Bus\Batch;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;

return $batch-&gt;id;</pre> <p>The batch's ID, which may be accessed via the <code>$batch-&gt;id</code> property, may be used to <a href="#inspecting-batches">query the Laravel command bus</a> for information about the batch after it has been dispatched.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-red-600"> <div class="opacity-75">

To assign an arbitrary name to a batch, you may call the <code>name</code> method while defining the batch:</p> <pre data-language="php">$batch = Bus::batch([

All batched jobs must execute within the same connection and queue:</p> <pre data-language="php">$batch = Bus::batch([
    // ...
])-&gt;then(function (Batch $batch) {
    // All jobs completed successfully...
})-&gt;onConnection('redis')-&gt;onQueue('imports')-&gt;dispatch();</pre>  <h3 id="chains-and-batches">Chains and Batches</h3> <p>You may define a set of <a href="#job-chaining">chained jobs</a> within a batch by placing the chained jobs within an array. For example, we may execute two job chains in parallel and execute a callback when both job chains have finished processing:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\ReleasePodcast;
use App\Jobs\SendPodcastReleaseNotification;
use Illuminate\Bus\Batch;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;
 
Bus::batch([

])-&gt;then(function (Batch $batch) {
    // ...
})-&gt;dispatch();</pre> <p>Conversely, you may run batches of jobs within a <a href="#job-chaining">chain</a> by defining batches within the chain. For example, you could first run a batch of jobs to release multiple podcasts then a batch of jobs to send the release notifications:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\FlushPodcastCache;
use App\Jobs\ReleasePodcast;
use App\Jobs\SendPodcastReleaseNotification;

        new SendPodcastReleaseNotification(2),
    ]),
])-&gt;dispatch();</pre>  <h3 id="adding-jobs-to-batches">Adding Jobs to Batches</h3> <p>Sometimes it may be useful to add additional jobs to a batch from within a batched job. This pattern can be useful when you need to batch thousands of jobs which may take too long to dispatch during a web request. So, instead, you may wish to dispatch an initial batch of "loader" jobs that hydrate the batch with even more jobs:</p> <pre data-language="php">$batch = Bus::batch([

Instead, you may utilize <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/TTL.html">DynamoDB's native TTL functionality</a> to automatically remove records for old batches.</p> <p>If you defined your DynamoDB table with a <code>ttl</code> attribute, you may define configuration parameters to instruct Laravel how to prune batch records. The <code>queue.batching.ttl_attribute</code> configuration value defines the name of the attribute holding the TTL, while the <code>queue.batching.ttl</code> configuration value defines the number of seconds after which a batch record can be removed from the DynamoDB table, relative to the last time the record was updated:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">'batching' =&gt; [

This is great for quick, simple tasks that need to be executed outside of the current request cycle. When dispatching closures to the queue, the closure's code content is cryptographically signed so that it can not be modified in transit:</p> <pre data-language="php">$podcast = App\Podcast::find(1);
 
dispatch(function () use ($podcast) {
    $podcast-&gt;publish();
});</pre> <p>Using the <code>catch</code> method, you may provide a closure that should be executed if the queued closure fails to complete successfully after exhausting all of your queue's <a href="#max-job-attempts-and-timeout">configured retry attempts</a>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Throwable;
 
dispatch(function () use ($podcast) {

You may run the worker using the <code>queue:work</code> Artisan command. Note that once the <code>queue:work</code> command has started, it will continue to run until it is manually stopped or you close your terminal:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work</pre> </div> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>
</svg></div> </div> <p class="mb-0 lg:ml-6 callout"> To keep the <code>queue:work</code> process running permanently in the background, you should use a process monitor such as <a href="#supervisor-configuration">Supervisor</a> to ensure that the queue worker does not stop running.</p> </div> <p>You may include the <code>-v</code> flag when invoking the <code>queue:work</code> command if you would like the processed job IDs to be included in the command's output:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work -v</pre> </div> <p>Remember, queue workers are long-lived processes and store the booted application state in memory. As a result, they will not notice changes in your code base after they have been started. So, during your deployment process, be sure to <a href="#queue-workers-and-deployment">restart your queue workers</a>. In addition, remember that any static state created or modified by your application will not be automatically reset between jobs.</p> <p>Alternatively, you may run the <code>queue:listen</code> command. When using the <code>queue:listen</code> command, you don't have to manually restart the worker when you want to reload your updated code or reset the application state; however, this command is significantly less efficient than the <code>queue:work</code> command:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:listen</pre> </div>  <h4 id="running-multiple-queue-workers">Running Multiple Queue Workers</h4> <p>To assign multiple workers to a queue and process jobs concurrently, you should simply start multiple <code>queue:work</code> processes. This can either be done locally via multiple tabs in your terminal or in production using your process manager's configuration settings. <a href="#supervisor-configuration">When using Supervisor</a>, you may use the <code>numprocs</code> configuration value.</p>  <h4 id="specifying-the-connection-queue">Specifying the Connection and Queue</h4> <p>You may also specify which queue connection the worker should utilize. The connection name passed to the <code>work</code> command should correspond to one of the connections defined in your <code>config/queue.php</code> configuration file:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work redis</pre> </div> <p>By default, the <code>queue:work</code> command only processes jobs for the default queue on a given connection. However, you may customize your queue worker even further by only processing particular queues for a given connection. For example, if all of your emails are processed in an <code>emails</code> queue on your <code>redis</code> queue connection, you may issue the following command to start a worker that only processes that queue:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work redis --queue=emails</pre> </div>  <h4 id="processing-a-specified-number-of-jobs">Processing a Specified Number of Jobs</h4> <p>The <code>--once</code> option may be used to instruct the worker to only process a single job from the queue:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --once</pre> </div> <p>The <code>--max-jobs</code> option may be used to instruct the worker to process the given number of jobs and then exit. This option may be useful when combined with <a href="#supervisor-configuration">Supervisor</a> so that your workers are automatically restarted after processing a given number of jobs, releasing any memory they may have accumulated:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --max-jobs=1000</pre> </div>  <h4 id="processing-all-queued-jobs-then-exiting">Processing All Queued Jobs and Then Exiting</h4> <p>The <code>--stop-when-empty</code> option may be used to instruct the worker to process all jobs and then exit gracefully. This option can be useful when processing Laravel queues within a Docker container if you wish to shutdown the container after the queue is empty:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --stop-when-empty</pre> </div>  <h4 id="processing-jobs-for-a-given-number-of-seconds">Processing Jobs for a Given Number of Seconds</h4> <p>The <code>--max-time</code> option may be used to instruct the worker to process jobs for the given number of seconds and then exit.

php artisan queue:work --max-time=3600</pre> </div>  <h4 id="worker-sleep-duration">Worker Sleep Duration</h4> <p>When jobs are available on the queue, the worker will keep processing jobs with no delay in between jobs. However, the <code>sleep</code> option determines how many seconds the worker will "sleep" if there are no jobs available. Of course, while sleeping, the worker will not process any new jobs:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --sleep=3</pre> </div>  <h4 id="maintenance-mode-queues">Maintenance Mode and Queues</h4> <p>While your application is in <a href="configuration.html#maintenance-mode">maintenance mode</a>, no queued jobs will be handled. The jobs will continue to be handled as normal once the application is out of maintenance mode.</p> <p>To force your queue workers to process jobs even if maintenance mode is enabled, you may use <code>--force</code> option:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --force</pre> </div>  <h4 id="resource-considerations">Resource Considerations</h4> <p>Daemon queue workers do not "reboot" the framework before processing each job. Therefore, you should release any heavy resources after each job completes. For example, if you are doing image manipulation with the GD library, you should free the memory with <code>imagedestroy</code> when you are done processing the image.</p>  <h3 id="queue-priorities">Queue Priorities</h3> <p>Sometimes you may wish to prioritize how your queues are processed. For example, in your <code>config/queue.php</code> configuration file, you may set the default <code>queue</code> for your <code>redis</code> connection to <code>low</code>. However, occasionally you may wish to push a job to a <code>high</code> priority queue like so:</p> <pre data-language="php">dispatch((new Job)-&gt;onQueue('high'));</pre> <p>To start a worker that verifies that all of the <code>high</code> queue jobs are processed before continuing to any jobs on the <code>low</code> queue, pass a comma-delimited list of queue names to the <code>work</code> command:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --queue=high,low</pre> </div>  <h3 id="queue-workers-and-deployment">Queue Workers and Deployment</h3> <p>Since queue workers are long-lived processes, they will not notice changes to your code without being restarted. So, the simplest way to deploy an application using queue workers is to restart the workers during your deployment process. You may gracefully restart all of the workers by issuing the <code>queue:restart</code> command:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:restart</pre> </div> <p>This command will instruct all queue workers to gracefully exit after they finish processing their current job so that no existing jobs are lost. Since the queue workers will exit when the <code>queue:restart</code> command is executed, you should be running a process manager such as <a href="#supervisor-configuration">Supervisor</a> to automatically restart the queue workers.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>

This option specifies how many seconds the queue connection should wait before retrying a job that is being processed. For example, if the value of <code>retry_after</code> is set to <code>90</code>, the job will be released back onto the queue if it has been processing for 90 seconds without being released or deleted. Typically, you should set the <code>retry_after</code> value to the maximum number of seconds your jobs should reasonably take to complete processing.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-red-600"> <div class="opacity-75">

By default, the <code>--timeout</code> value is 60 seconds. If a job is processing for longer than the number of seconds specified by the timeout value, the worker processing the job will exit with an error. Typically, the worker will be restarted automatically by a <a href="#supervisor-configuration">process manager configured on your server</a>:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work --timeout=60</pre> </div> <p>The <code>retry_after</code> configuration option and the <code>--timeout</code> CLI option are different, but work together to ensure that jobs are not lost and that jobs are only successfully processed once.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-red-600"> <div class="opacity-75">

</svg> </div> </div> <p class="mb-0 lg:ml-6 callout"> The <code>--timeout</code> value should always be at least several seconds shorter than your <code>retry_after</code> configuration value. This will ensure that a worker processing a frozen job is always terminated before the job is retried. If your <code>--timeout</code> option is longer than your <code>retry_after</code> configuration value, your jobs may be processed twice.</p> </div>  <h2 id="supervisor-configuration">Supervisor Configuration</h2> <p>In production, you need a way to keep your <code>queue:work</code> processes running. A <code>queue:work</code> process may stop running for a variety of reasons, such as an exceeded worker timeout or the execution of the <code>queue:restart</code> command.</p> <p>For this reason, you need to configure a process monitor that can detect when your <code>queue:work</code> processes exit and automatically restart them. In addition, process monitors can allow you to specify how many <code>queue:work</code> processes you would like to run concurrently. Supervisor is a process monitor commonly used in Linux environments and we will discuss how to configure it in the following documentation.</p>  <h4 id="installing-supervisor">Installing Supervisor</h4> <p>Supervisor is a process monitor for the Linux operating system, and will automatically restart your <code>queue:work</code> processes if they fail. To install Supervisor on Ubuntu, you may use the following command:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">sudo apt-get install supervisor</pre> </div> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>

Within this directory, you may create any number of configuration files that instruct supervisor how your processes should be monitored. For example, let's create a <code>laravel-worker.conf</code> file that starts and monitors <code>queue:work</code> processes:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="ini">[program:laravel-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d

killasgroup=true
user=forge
numprocs=8
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/home/forge/app.com/worker.log
stopwaitsecs=3600</pre> </div> <p>In this example, the <code>numprocs</code> directive will instruct Supervisor to run eight <code>queue:work</code> processes and monitor all of them, automatically restarting them if they fail. You should change the <code>command</code> directive of the configuration to reflect your desired queue connection and worker options.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-red-600"> <div class="opacity-75">

Don't worry, things don't always go as planned! Laravel includes a convenient way to <a href="#max-job-attempts-and-timeout">specify the maximum number of times a job should be attempted</a>. After an asynchronous job has exceeded this number of attempts, it will be inserted into the <code>failed_jobs</code> database table. <a href="queues.html#synchronous-dispatching">Synchronously dispatched jobs</a> that fail are not stored in this table and their exceptions are immediately handled by the application.</p> <p>A migration to create the <code>failed_jobs</code> table is typically already present in new Laravel applications. However, if your application does not contain a migration for this table, you may use the <code>make:queue-failed-table</code> command to create the migration:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan make:queue-failed-table
 
php artisan migrate</pre> </div> <p>When running a <a href="#running-the-queue-worker">queue worker</a> process, you may specify the maximum number of times a job should be attempted using the <code>--tries</code> switch on the <code>queue:work</code> command. If you do not specify a value for the <code>--tries</code> option, jobs will only be attempted once or as many times as specified by the job class' <code>$tries</code> property:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work redis --tries=3</pre> </div> <p>Using the <code>--backoff</code> option, you may specify how many seconds Laravel should wait before retrying a job that has encountered an exception. By default, a job is immediately released back onto the queue so that it may be attempted again:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">php artisan queue:work redis --tries=3 --backoff=3</pre> </div> <p>If you would like to configure how many seconds Laravel should wait before retrying a job that has encountered an exception on a per-job basis, you may do so by defining a <code>backoff</code> property on your job class:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
 * The number of seconds to wait before retrying the job.
 *
 * @var int
 */
public $backoff = 3;</pre> <p>If you require more complex logic for determining the job's backoff time, you may define a <code>backoff</code> method on your job class:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
* Calculate the number of seconds to wait before retrying the job.
*/
public function backoff(): int
{
    return 3;
}</pre> <p>You may easily configure "exponential" backoffs by returning an array of backoff values from the <code>backoff</code> method. In this example, the retry delay will be 1 second for the first retry, 5 seconds for the second retry, 10 seconds for the third retry, and 10 seconds for every subsequent retry if there are more attempts remaining:</p> <pre data-language="php">/**
* Calculate the number of seconds to wait before retrying the job.

*/
public function backoff(): array
{
    return [1, 5, 10];
}</pre>  <h3 id="cleaning-up-after-failed-jobs">Cleaning Up After Failed Jobs</h3> <p>When a particular job fails, you may want to send an alert to your users or revert any actions that were partially completed by the job. To accomplish this, you may define a <code>failed</code> method on your job class. The <code>Throwable</code> instance that caused the job to fail will be passed to the <code>failed</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

Since the application name is part of the DynamoDB table's key, you can use the same table to store failed jobs for multiple Laravel applications.</p> <p>In addition, ensure that you install the AWS SDK so that your Laravel application can communicate with Amazon DynamoDB:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="shell">composer require aws/aws-sdk-php</pre> </div> <p>Next, set the <code>queue.failed.driver</code> configuration option's value to <code>dynamodb</code>. In addition, you should define <code>key</code>, <code>secret</code>, and <code>region</code> configuration options within the failed job configuration array. These options will be used to authenticate with AWS. When using the <code>dynamodb</code> driver, the <code>queue.failed.database</code> configuration option is unnecessary:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">'failed' =&gt; [
    'driver' =&gt; env('QUEUE_FAILED_DRIVER', 'dynamodb'),
    'key' =&gt; env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
    'secret' =&gt; env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
    'region' =&gt; env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION', 'us-east-1'),
    'table' =&gt; 'failed_jobs',
],</pre> </div>  <h3 id="disabling-failed-job-storage">Disabling Failed Job Storage</h3> <p>You may instruct Laravel to discard failed jobs without storing them by setting the <code>queue.failed.driver</code> configuration option's value to <code>null</code>. Typically, this may be accomplished via the <code>QUEUE_FAILED_DRIVER</code> environment variable:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="ini">QUEUE_FAILED_DRIVER=null</pre> </div>  <h3 id="failed-job-events">Failed Job Events</h3> <p>If you would like to register an event listener that will be invoked when a job fails, you may use the <code>Queue</code> facade's <code>failing</code> method. For example, we may attach a closure to this event from the <code>boot</code> method of the <code>AppServiceProvider</code> that is included with Laravel:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

If you wish, Laravel can alert you when your queue job count exceeds a specified threshold.</p> <p>To get started, you should schedule the <code>queue:monitor</code> command to <a href="scheduling.html">run every minute</a>.

When the command encounters a queue that has a job count exceeding your threshold, an <code>Illuminate\Queue\Events\QueueBusy</code> event will be dispatched. You may listen for this event within your application's <code>AppServiceProvider</code> in order to send a notification to you or your development team:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">use App\Notifications\QueueHasLongWaitTime;

The <code>Bus</code> facade's <code>assertChained</code> method may be used to assert that a <a href="queues.html#job-chaining">chain of jobs</a> was dispatched. The <code>assertChained</code> method accepts an array of chained jobs as its first argument:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\RecordShipment;
use App\Jobs\ShipOrder;
use App\Jobs\UpdateInventory;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;
 
Bus::fake();
 
// ...
 
Bus::assertChained([
    ShipOrder::class,
    RecordShipment::class,
    UpdateInventory::class
]);</pre> <p>As you can see in the example above, the array of chained jobs may be an array of the job's class names. However, you may also provide an array of actual job instances. When doing so, Laravel will ensure that the job instances are of the same class and have the same property values of the chained jobs dispatched by your application:</p> <pre data-language="php">Bus::assertChained([
    new ShipOrder,
    new RecordShipment,
    new UpdateInventory,
]);</pre> <p>You may use the <code>assertDispatchedWithoutChain</code> method to assert that a job was pushed without a chain of jobs:</p> <pre data-language="php">Bus::assertDispatchedWithoutChain(ShipOrder::class);</pre>  <h4 id="testing-chain-modifications">Testing Chain Modifications</h4> <p>If a chained job <a href="#adding-jobs-to-the-chain">prepends or appends jobs to an existing chain</a>, you may use the job's <code>assertHasChain</code> method to assert that the job has the expected chain of remaining jobs:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">$job = new ProcessPodcast;
 
$job-&gt;handle();
 
$job-&gt;assertHasChain([
    new TranscribePodcast,
    new OptimizePodcast,
    new ReleasePodcast,
]);</pre> </div> <p>The <code>assertDoesntHaveChain</code> method may be used to assert that the job's remaining chain is empty:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">$job-&gt;assertDoesntHaveChain();</pre> </div>  <h4 id="testing-chained-batches">Testing Chained Batches</h4> <p>If your job chain <a href="#chains-and-batches">contains a batch of jobs</a>, you may assert that the chained batch matches your expectations by inserting a <code>Bus::chainedBatch</code> definition within your chain assertion:</p> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\ShipOrder;
use App\Jobs\UpdateInventory;
use Illuminate\Bus\PendingBatch;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;
 
Bus::assertChained([
    new ShipOrder,
    Bus::chainedBatch(function (PendingBatch $batch) {
        return $batch-&gt;jobs-&gt;count() === 3;
    }),
    new UpdateInventory,
]);</pre>  <h3 id="testing-job-batches">Testing Job Batches</h3> <p>The <code>Bus</code> facade's <code>assertBatched</code> method may be used to assert that a <a href="queues.html#job-batching">batch of jobs</a> was dispatched. The closure given to the <code>assertBatched</code> method receives an instance of <code>Illuminate\Bus\PendingBatch</code>, which may be used to inspect the jobs within the batch:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Bus\PendingBatch;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;
 
Bus::fake();

Bus::assertBatched(function (PendingBatch $batch) {
    return $batch-&gt;name == 'import-csv' &amp;&amp;
           $batch-&gt;jobs-&gt;count() === 10;
});</pre> <p>You may use the <code>assertBatchCount</code> method to assert that a given number of batches were dispatched:</p> <pre data-language="php">Bus::assertBatchCount(3);</pre> <p>You may use <code>assertNothingBatched</code> to assert that no batches were dispatched:</p> <pre data-language="php">Bus::assertNothingBatched();</pre>  <h4 id="testing-job-batch-interaction">Testing Job / Batch Interaction</h4> <p>In addition, you may occasionally need to test an individual job's interaction with its underlying batch. For example, you may need to test if a job cancelled further processing for its batch. To accomplish this, you need to assign a fake batch to the job via the <code>withFakeBatch</code> method. The <code>withFakeBatch</code> method returns a tuple containing the job instance and the fake batch:</p> <pre data-language="php">[$job, $batch] = (new ShipOrder)-&gt;withFakeBatch();
 
$job-&gt;handle();
 
$this-&gt;assertTrue($batch-&gt;cancelled());
$this-&gt;assertEmpty($batch-&gt;added);</pre>  <h3 id="testing-job-queue-interactions">Testing Job / Queue Interactions</h3> <p>Sometimes, you may need to test that a queued job <a href="#manually-releasing-a-job">releases itself back onto the queue</a>. Or, you may need to test that the job deleted itself. You may test these queue interactions by instantiating the job and invoking the <code>withFakeQueueInteractions</code> method.</p> <p>Once the job's queue interactions have been faked, you may invoke the <code>handle</code> method on the job. After invoking the job, the <code>assertReleased</code>, <code>assertDeleted</code>, and <code>assertFailed</code> methods may be used to make assertions against the job's queue interactions:</p> <div class="code-container"> <pre data-language="php">use App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast;
 
$job = (new ProcessPodcast)-&gt;withFakeQueueInteractions();
 
$job-&gt;handle();
 
$job-&gt;assertReleased(delay: 30);
$job-&gt;assertDeleted();
$job-&gt;assertFailed();</pre> </div>  <h2 id="job-events">Job Events</h2> <p>Using the <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> methods on the <code>Queue</code> <a href="facades.html">facade</a>, you may specify callbacks to be executed before or after a queued job is processed. These callbacks are a great opportunity to perform additional logging or increment statistics for a dashboard. Typically, you should call these methods from the <code>boot</code> method of a <a href="providers.html">service provider</a>. For example, we may use the <code>AppServiceProvider</code> that is included with Laravel:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Providers;
 
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Queue;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Queue\Events\JobProcessed;
use Illuminate\Queue\Events\JobProcessing;
 
class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        // ...
    }
 
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Queue::before(function (JobProcessing $event) {
            // $event-&gt;connectionName
            // $event-&gt;job
            // $event-&gt;job-&gt;payload()
        });
 
        Queue::after(function (JobProcessed $event) {
            // $event-&gt;connectionName
            // $event-&gt;job
            // $event-&gt;job-&gt;payload()
        });
    }
}</pre> <p>Using the <code>looping</code> method on the <code>Queue</code> <a href="facades.html">facade</a>, you may specify callbacks that execute before the worker attempts to fetch a job from a queue. For example, you might register a closure to rollback any transactions that were left open by a previously failed job:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Queue;
 
Queue::looping(function () {
    while (DB::transactionLevel() &gt; 0) {
        DB::rollBack();
    }
