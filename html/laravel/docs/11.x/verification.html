Rather than forcing you to re-implement this feature by hand for each application you create, Laravel provides convenient built-in services for sending and verifying email verification requests.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>
</svg></div> </div> <p class="mb-0 lg:ml-6 callout"> Want to get started fast? Install one of the <a href="starter-kits.html">Laravel application starter kits</a> in a fresh Laravel application. The starter kits will take care of scaffolding your entire authentication system, including email verification support.</p> </div>  <h3 id="model-preparation">Model Preparation</h3> <p>Before getting started, verify that your <code>App\Models\User</code> model implements the <code>Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail</code> contract:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
 
class User extends Authenticatable implements MustVerifyEmail
{
    use Notifiable;
 
    // ...
}</pre> <p>Once this interface has been added to your model, newly registered users will automatically be sent an email containing an email verification link. This happens seamlessly because Laravel automatically registers the <code>Illuminate\Auth\Listeners\SendEmailVerificationNotification</code> <a href="events.html">listener</a> for the <code>Illuminate\Auth\Events\Registered</code> event.</p> <p>If you are manually implementing registration within your application instead of using <a href="starter-kits.html">a starter kit</a>, you should ensure that you are dispatching the <code>Illuminate\Auth\Events\Registered</code> event after a user's registration is successful:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Auth\Events\Registered;
 
event(new Registered($user));</pre>  <h3 id="database-preparation">Database Preparation</h3> <p>Next, your <code>users</code> table must contain an <code>email_verified_at</code> column to store the date and time that the user's email address was verified. Typically, this is included in Laravel's default <code>0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php</code> database migration.</p>  <h2 id="verification-routing">Routing</h2> <p>To properly implement email verification, three routes will need to be defined. First, a route will be needed to display a notice to the user that they should click the email verification link in the verification email that Laravel sent them after registration.</p> <p>Second, a route will be needed to handle requests generated when the user clicks the email verification link in the email.</p> <p>Third, a route will be needed to resend a verification link if the user accidentally loses the first verification link.</p>  <h3 id="the-email-verification-notice">The Email Verification Notice</h3> <p>As mentioned previously, a route should be defined that will return a view instructing the user to click the email verification link that was emailed to them by Laravel after registration. This view will be displayed to users when they try to access other parts of the application without verifying their email address first. Remember, the link is automatically emailed to the user as long as your <code>App\Models\User</code> model implements the <code>MustVerifyEmail</code> interface:</p> <pre data-language="php">Route::get('/email/verify', function () {
    return view('auth.verify-email');
})-&gt;middleware('auth')-&gt;name('verification.notice');</pre> <p>The route that returns the email verification notice should be named <code>verification.notice</code>. It is important that the route is assigned this exact name since the <code>verified</code> middleware <a href="#protecting-routes">included with Laravel</a> will automatically redirect to this route name if a user has not verified their email address.</p> <div class="mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 shadow-lg lg:flex lg:items-center callout"> <div class="w-20 h-20 mb-6 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 lg:mb-0 bg-purple-600"> <div class="opacity-75"><svg width="28" height="40" viewbox="0 0 28 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>lightbulb</title>
</svg></div> </div> <p class="mb-0 lg:ml-6 callout"> When manually implementing email verification, you are required to define the contents of the verification notice view yourself. If you would like scaffolding that includes all necessary authentication and verification views, check out the <a href="starter-kits.html">Laravel application starter kits</a>.</p> </div>  <h3 id="the-email-verification-handler">The Email Verification Handler</h3> <p>Next, we need to define a route that will handle requests generated when the user clicks the email verification link that was emailed to them. This route should be named <code>verification.verify</code> and be assigned the <code>auth</code> and <code>signed</code> middlewares:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\EmailVerificationRequest;
 
Route::get('/email/verify/{id}/{hash}', function (EmailVerificationRequest $request) {
    $request-&gt;fulfill();
 
    return redirect('/home');
})-&gt;middleware(['auth', 'signed'])-&gt;name('verification.verify');</pre> <p>Before moving on, let's take a closer look at this route. First, you'll notice we are using an <code>EmailVerificationRequest</code> request type instead of the typical <code>Illuminate\Http\Request</code> instance. The <code>EmailVerificationRequest</code> is a <a href="validation.html#form-request-validation">form request</a> that is included with Laravel. This request will automatically take care of validating the request's <code>id</code> and <code>hash</code> parameters.</p> <p>Next, we can proceed directly to calling the <code>fulfill</code> method on the request. This method will call the <code>markEmailAsVerified</code> method on the authenticated user and dispatch the <code>Illuminate\Auth\Events\Verified</code> event. The <code>markEmailAsVerified</code> method is available to the default <code>App\Models\User</code> model via the <code>Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User</code> base class. Once the user's email address has been verified, you may redirect them wherever you wish.</p>  <h3 id="resending-the-verification-email">Resending the Verification Email</h3> <p>Sometimes a user may misplace or accidentally delete the email address verification email. To accommodate this, you may wish to define a route to allow the user to request that the verification email be resent. You may then make a request to this route by placing a simple form submission button within your <a href="#the-email-verification-notice">verification notice view</a>:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Http\Request;
 
Route::post('/email/verification-notification', function (Request $request) {
    $request-&gt;user()-&gt;sendEmailVerificationNotification();
 
    return back()-&gt;with('message', 'Verification link sent!');
})-&gt;middleware(['auth', 'throttle:6,1'])-&gt;name('verification.send');</pre>  <h3 id="protecting-routes">Protecting Routes</h3> <p><a href="middleware.html">Route middleware</a> may be used to only allow verified users to access a given route. Laravel includes a <code>verified</code> <a href="middleware.html#middleware-alias">middleware alias</a>, which is an alias for the <code>Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\EnsureEmailIsVerified</code> middleware class. Since this alias is already automatically registered by Laravel, all you need to do is attach the <code>verified</code> middleware to a route definition. Typically, this middleware is paired with the <code>auth</code> middleware:</p> <pre data-language="php">Route::get('/profile', function () {
    // Only verified users may access this route...
})-&gt;middleware(['auth', 'verified']);</pre> <p>If an unverified user attempts to access a route that has been assigned this middleware, they will automatically be redirected to the <code>verification.notice</code> <a href="routing.html#named-routes">named route</a>.</p>  <h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>  <h4 id="verification-email-customization">Verification Email Customization</h4> <p>Although the default email verification notification should satisfy the requirements of most applications, Laravel allows you to customize how the email verification mail message is constructed.</p> <p>To get started, pass a closure to the <code>toMailUsing</code> method provided by the <code>Illuminate\Auth\Notifications\VerifyEmail</code> notification. The closure will receive the notifiable model instance that is receiving the notification as well as the signed email verification URL that the user must visit to verify their email address. The closure should return an instance of <code>Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage</code>. Typically, you should call the <code>toMailUsing</code> method from the <code>boot</code> method of your application's <code>AppServiceProvider</code> class:</p> <pre data-language="php">use Illuminate\Auth\Notifications\VerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage;
 
/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    // ...
 
    VerifyEmail::toMailUsing(function (object $notifiable, string $url) {
        return (new MailMessage)
            -&gt;subject('Verify Email Address')
            -&gt;line('Click the button below to verify your email address.')
            -&gt;action('Verify Email Address', $url);
    });
