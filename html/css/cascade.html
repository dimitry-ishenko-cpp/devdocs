<header><h1>Introducing the CSS Cascade</h1></header><div class="section-content">
<p>The <strong>cascade</strong> is an algorithm that defines how user agents combine property values originating from different sources. The cascade defines the origin and layer that takes precedence when declarations in more than one <a href="#origin_types">origin</a>, <a href="@layer.html">cascade layer</a>, or <a href="@scope.html"><code>@scope</code></a> block set a value for a property on an element.</p> <p>The cascade lies at the core of CSS, as emphasized by the name: <em><strong>Cascading</strong></em> Style Sheets. When a <a href="css_selectors.html">selector</a> matches an element, the property value from the origin with the highest precedence gets applied, even if the selector from a lower precedence origin or layer has greater <a href="specificity.html">specificity</a>.</p> <p>This article explains what the cascade is and the order in which <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS">CSS</a> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a> cascade, covering cascade layers and origin type. Understanding origin precedence is key to understanding the cascade.</p>

<div class="section-content">
<p>The CSS cascade algorithm's job is to select CSS declarations in order to determine the correct values for CSS properties. CSS declarations come from different origin types: <strong><a href="#user-agent_stylesheets">User-agent stylesheets</a></strong>, <strong><a href="#author_stylesheets">Author stylesheets</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="#user_stylesheets">User stylesheets</a></strong>.</p> <p>Though style sheets come from these different origins and can be within different <a href="@layer.html">layers</a> in each of these origins, they overlap in terms of their default scope; to make this work, the cascade algorithm defines how they interact. Before addressing the interactions, we'll define some key terms in the next few sections.</p>
</div></section><section aria-labelledby="user-agent_stylesheets"><h3 id="user-agent_stylesheets">User-agent stylesheets</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>User-agents, or browsers, have basic style sheets that give default styles to any document. These style sheets are named <strong>user-agent stylesheets</strong>. Most browsers use actual stylesheets for this purpose, while others simulate them in code. The end result is the same.</p> <p>Some browsers let users modify the user-agent stylesheet, but this is rare and not something that can be controlled.</p> <p>Although some constraints on user-agent stylesheets are set by the HTML specification, browsers have a lot of latitude: that means some differences exist between browsers. To simplify the development process, Web developers may use a CSS reset stylesheet, such as <a href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css" target="_blank">normalize.css</a>, which sets common properties values to a known state for all browsers before beginning to make alterations to suit their specific needs.</p> <p>Unless the user-agent stylesheet includes an <a href="specificity.html#the_!important_exception"><code>!important</code></a> next to a property, making it "important", styles declared by author styles, including a reset style sheet, take precedence over the user-agent styles, regardless of the specificity of the associated selector.</p>
</div></section><section aria-labelledby="author_stylesheets"><h3 id="author_stylesheets">Author stylesheets</h3>
<div class="section-content"><p><strong>Author stylesheets</strong> are the most common type of style sheet; these are the styles written by web developers. These styles can reset user-agent styles, as noted above, and define the styles for the design of a given web page or application. The author, or web developer, defines the styles for the document using one or more linked or imported stylesheets, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style"><code>&lt;style&gt;</code></a> blocks, and inline styles defined with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/style"><code>style</code></a> attribute. These author styles define the look and feel of the website — its theme.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="user_stylesheets"><h3 id="user_stylesheets">User stylesheets</h3>
<div class="section-content"><p>In most browsers, the user (or reader) of the website can choose to override styles using a custom <strong>user stylesheet</strong> designed to tailor the experience to the user's wishes. Depending on the user agent, <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/user-style-sheet-3469931" target="_blank">user styles can be configured</a> directly or added via browser extensions.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="cascade_layers"><h3 id="cascade_layers">Cascade layers</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>The cascade order is based on origin type. The cascade within each origin type is based on the declaration order of <a href="@layer.html">cascade layers</a> within that type. For all origins - user-agent, author, or user - styles can be declared within or outside of named or anonymous layers. When declared using <a href="@import.html"><code>layer</code>, <code>layer()</code></a> or <a href="@layer.html"><code>@layer</code></a>, styles are placed into the specified named layer, or into an anonymous layer if no name is provided. Styles declared outside of a layer are treated as being part of an anonymous last declared layer.</p> <p>Let's take a look at cascading origin type before diving into cascade layers within each origin type.</p>
</div></section><section aria-labelledby="cascading_order"><h2 id="cascading_order">Cascading order</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>The cascading algorithm determines how to find the value to apply for each property for each document element. The following steps apply to the cascading algorithm:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Relevance</strong>: It first filters all the rules from the different sources to keep only the rules that apply to a given element. That means rules whose selector matches the given element and which are part of an appropriate <code>media</code> at-rule.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Origin and importance</strong>: Then it sorts these rules according to their importance, that is, whether or not they are followed by <code>!important</code>, and by their origin. Ignoring layers for the moment, the cascade order is as follows:</p> <figure class="table-container"><div class="_table"><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Order (low to high)</th> <th>Origin</th> <th>Importance</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>user-agent (browser)</td> <td>normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>user</td> <td>normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>author (developer)</td> <td>normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>CSS @keyframe animations</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>author (developer)</td> <td><code>!important</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>user</td> <td><code>!important</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>user-agent (browser)</td> <td><code>!important</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>CSS transitions</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div></figure> </li> <li> <p><strong>Specificity</strong>: In case of equality with an origin, the <a href="specificity.html">specificity</a> of a rule is considered to choose one value or another. The specificity of the selectors are compared, and the declaration with the highest specificity wins.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scoping proximity</strong>: When two selectors in the origin layer with precedence have the same specificity, the property value within scoped rules with the smallest number of hops up the DOM hierarchy to the scope root wins. See <a href="@scope.html#how_scope_conflicts_are_resolved">How <code>@scope</code> conflicts are resolved</a> for more details and an example.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Order of appearance</strong>: In the origin with precedence, if there are competing values for a property that are in style block matching selectors of equal specificity and scoping proximity, the last declaration in the style order is applied.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The cascade is in ascending order, meaning animations have precedence of normal values, whether those are declared in user, author, or user-agent styles, important values take precedence over animations, and transitions have precedence over important values.</p> <div class="notecard note"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Transitions and animations</strong></p> <p>Property values set by animation <a href="@keyframes.html"><code>@keyframes</code></a> are more important than all normal styles (those with no <a href="specificity.html#the_!important_exception"><code>!important</code></a> set).</p> <p>Property values being set in a <a href="transition.html"><code>transition</code></a> take precedence over all other values set, even those marked with <code>!important</code>.</p> </div> <p>The cascade algorithm is applied <em>before</em> the specificity algorithm, meaning if <code>:root p { color: red;}</code> is declared in the user stylesheet (row 2) and a less specific <code>p {color: blue;}</code> is in the author stylesheet (row 3), the paragraphs will be blue.</p>
</div></section><section aria-labelledby="basic_example"><h2 id="basic_example">Basic example</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Before taking a deeper look at how cascade layers impact the cascade, let's look at an example involving multiple sources of CSS across the various origins, and work through the steps of the cascade algorithm:</p> <p>Here we have a user agent style sheet, two author style sheets, and a user stylesheet, with no inline styles within the HTML:</p> <p><strong>User-agent CSS:</strong></p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="css">li {
  margin-left: 10px;
}
</pre></div> <p><strong>Author CSS 1:</strong></p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="css">li {
  margin-left: 0;
} /* This is a reset */
</pre></div> <p><strong>Author CSS 2:</strong></p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="css">@media screen {
  li {
    margin-left: 3px;
  }
}

@media print {
  li {
    margin-left: 1px;
  }
}

@layer namedLayer {
  li {
    margin-left: 5px;
  }
}
</pre></div> <p><strong>User CSS:</strong></p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="css">.specific {
  margin-left: 1em;
}
</pre></div> <p><strong>HTML:</strong></p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li class="specific"&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre></div> <p>In this case, declarations inside <code>li</code> and <code>.specific</code> rules should apply.</p> <p>Once again, there are five steps in the cascade algorithm, in order:</p> <ol> <li>Relevance</li> <li>Origin and importance</li> <li>Specificity</li> <li>Scoping proximity</li> <li>Order of appearance</li> </ol> <p>The <code>1px</code> is for print media. Due to lack of <em>relevance</em> based on its media type, it is removed from consideration.</p> <p>No declaration is marked as <code>!important</code>, so the precedence order is author style sheets over user style sheets over user-agent stylesheet. Based on <em>origin and importance</em>, the <code>1em</code> from the user stylesheet and the <code>10px</code> from the user-agent stylesheet are removed from consideration.</p> <p>Note that even though the user style on <code>.specific</code> of <code>1em</code> has a higher specificity, it's a normal declaration in a user style sheet. As such, it has a lower precedence than any author styles, and gets removed by the origin and importance step of the algorithm before specificity even comes into play.</p> <p>There are three declarations in author stylesheets:</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="css">li {
  margin-left: 0;
} /* from author css 1 */
</pre></div> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="css">@media screen {
  li {
    margin-left: 3px;
  }
}
</pre></div> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="css">@layer namedLayer {
  li {
    margin-left: 5px;
  }
}
</pre></div> <p>The last one, the <code>5px</code> is part of a cascade layer. Normal declarations in layers have lower precedence than normal styles not in a layer within the same origin type. This is also removed by step 2 of the algorithm, <em>origin and importance</em>.</p> <p>This leaves the <code>0</code> and the <code>3px</code>, which both have the same selector, hence the same <em>specificity</em>. Neither of them are inside a <code>@scope</code> block, so scoping proximity does not come into play in this example either.</p> <p>We then look at <em>order of appearance</em>. The second one, the last of the two unlayered author styles, wins.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="css">margin-left: 3px;
</pre></div> <div class="notecard note"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The declaration defined in the user CSS, while it may have greater specificity, is not chosen as the cascade algorithm's <em>origin and importance</em> is applied before the <em>specificity</em> algorithm. The declaration defined in a cascade layer, though it may come later in the code, will not have precedence either as normal styles in cascade layers have less precedence than normal unlayered styles. <em>Order of appearance</em> only matters when both origin, importance, and specificity are equal.</p> </div>
</div></section><section aria-labelledby="author_styles_inline_styles_layers_and_precedence"><h2 id="author_styles_inline_styles_layers_and_precedence">Author styles: inline styles, layers, and precedence</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>The <a href="#cascading_order">table in Cascading order</a> provided a precedence order overview. The table summarized the user-agent, user, and author origin type styles in two lines each with "origin type - normal" and "origin type - !important". The precedence within each origin type is more nuanced. Styles can be contained within layers within their origin type, and, with author styles, there is also the issue of where inline styles land in the cascade order.</p> <p>The order in which layers are declared is important in determining precedence. Normal styles in a layer take precedence over styles declared in prior layers; with normal styles declared outside of any layer taking precedence over normal layered styles regardless of specificity.</p> <p>In this example, the author used CSS's <a href="@import.html"><code>@import</code></a> rule to import five external style sheets within a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style"><code>&lt;style&gt;</code></a> information element.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="html">&lt;style&gt;
  @import unlayeredStyles.css;
  @import AStyles.css layer(A);
  @import moreUnlayeredStyles.css;
  @import BStyles.css layer(B);
  @import CStyles.css layer(C);
  p {
    color: red;
    padding: 1em !important;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre></div> <p>and then in the body of the document we have inline styles:</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="html">&lt;p style="line-height: 1.6em; text-decoration: overline !important;"&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
</pre></div> <p> In the CSS code block above, three cascade layers named "A", "B", and "C", were created, in that order. Three stylesheets were imported directly into layers and two were imported without creating or being assigned to a layer. The "All unlayered styles" in the list below (normal author style precedence - order 4) includes styles from these two stylesheets and the additional unlayered CSS style blocks. In addition, there are two inline styles, a normal <code>line-height</code> declaration and an important <code>text-decoration</code> declaration: </p> <figure class="table-container"><div class="_table"><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Order (low to high)</th> <th>Author style</th> <th>Importance</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>A - first layer</td> <td>normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>B - second layer</td> <td>normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>C - last layer</td> <td>normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>All unlayered styles</td> <td>normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>inline <code>style</code>
</td> <td>normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>animations</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>All unlayered styles</td> <td><code>!important</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>C - last layer</td> <td><code>!important</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>B - second layer</td> <td><code>!important</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>A - first layer</td> <td><code>!important</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>11</td> <td>inline <code>style</code>
</td> <td><code>!important</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>12</td> <td>transitions</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div></figure> <p>In all origin types, the non important styles contained in layers have the lowest precedence. In our example, the normal styles associated with the first declared layer (A) have lower precedence than normal styles in the second declared layer (B), which have lower precedence than normal styles in the third declared layer (C). These layered styles have lower precedence than all normal unlayered styles, which includes normal styles from <code>unlayeredStyles.css</code>, <code>moreUnlayeredStyles.css</code>, and the <code>color</code> of <code>p</code> in the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> itself.</p> <p>If any of the layered styles in A, B, or C, have selectors with higher specificity matching an element, similar to <code>:root body p { color: black;}</code>, it doesn't matter. Those declarations are removed from consideration because of <em>origin</em>; normal layered styles have less precedence than normal unlayered styles. If, however, the more specific selector <code>:root body p { color: black;}</code> was found in <code>unlayeredStyles.css</code>, as both <em>origin and importance</em> have the same precedence, <em>specificity</em> would mean the more specific, black declaration would win.</p> <p>The layer order of precedence is inverted for styles declared as <code>!important</code>. Important styles declared in a layer take precedence over important styles declared outside of a layer. Important styles in the first declared layer (A) take precedence over important declarations found in layer B, which takes precedence over C, which have precedence over important declarations in the unlayered styles.</p>
</div></section><section aria-labelledby="inline_styles"><h3 id="inline_styles">Inline styles</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Only relevant to author styles are inline styles, declared with the <code>style</code> attribute. Normal inline styles take precedence over any other normal author styles, no matter the specificity of the selector. If <code>line-height: 2;</code> were declared in a <code>:root body p</code> selector block in any of the five imported stylesheets, the line height would still be <code>1.6</code>.</p> <p>Normal inline styles take precedence over any other normal author styles unless the property is being altered by a CSS animation.</p> <p>All important inline styles take precedence over all author styles, important and not, inline and not, layered and not. Important styles also take precedence over animated properties, but not transitioning properties. Three things can override an important inline style: 1) an important user style, 2) an important user agent style, or 3) a property value being transitioned.</p>
</div></section><section aria-labelledby="importance_and_layers"><h3 id="importance_and_layers">Importance and layers</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>The origin type precedence order is inverted for important styles. Important styles declared outside of any cascade layer have lower precedence than those declared as part of a layer. Important values that come in early layers have precedence over important styles declared in subsequent cascade layers.</p> <p>Take for example the following CSS:</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="css">p {
  color: red;
}
@layer B {
  :root p {
    color: blue;
  }
}
</pre></div> <p>Even though the red is declared first and has a less specific selector, because unlayered CSS takes precedence over layered CSS, the paragraph will be red. Had we included an inline style on the paragraph setting it to a different color, such as <code>&lt;p style="color: black"&gt;</code>, the paragraph would be black.</p> <p>When we add <code>!important</code> to this bit of CSS, the precedence order is reversed with the stylesheet:</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="css">p {
  color: red !important;
}
@layer B {
  :root p {
    color: blue !important;
  }
}
</pre></div> <p>Now the paragraph will be blue. The <code>!important</code> in the earliest declared layer takes precedence of subsequent layers and unlayered important declarations. If the inline style contained !important, such as <code>&lt;p style="color: black !important"&gt;</code>, again the paragraph would be black. Inline importance does take precedence over all other author declared <code>!important</code> declarations, no matter the specificity.</p> <div class="notecard note"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>!important</code> flag reverses the precedence of cascade layers. For this reason, try not to use <code>!important</code> to override external styles. Instead, use <a href="@import.html"><code>@import</code></a> together with the <code>layer</code> keyword or <code>layer()</code> function to import external style sheets (from frameworks, widget stylesheets, libraries, etc.) into layers. Importing stylesheets into a layer as the first declaration in your CSS demotes their precedence, and author-defined layers, defined later in your CSS, will have higher precedence. The <code>!important</code> flag should only be used sparingly, if ever, to guard required styles against later overrides, in the first declared layer.</p> </div> <p>Styles that are transitioning take precedence over all important styles, no matter who or how they are declared.</p>

<p>Now that we have a better understanding of origin type and cascade layer precedence, we realize the table in <a href="#cascading_order">Cascading order</a> could have more accurately been represented by the following table:</p> <figure class="table-container"><div class="_table"><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Precedence Order<br>(low to high)</th> <th>Style Origin</th> <th>Importance</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan="3">1</td> <td>user-agent - first declared layer</td> <td rowspan="3">normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>user-agent - last declared layer</td> </tr> <tr> <td>user-agent - unlayered styles</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="3">2</td> <td>user - first declared layer</td> <td rowspan="3">normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>user - last declared layer</td> </tr> <tr> <td>user - unlayered styles</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="4">3</td> <td>author - first declared layer</td> <td rowspan="4">normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>author - last declared layer</td> </tr> <tr> <td>author - unlayered styles</td> </tr> <tr> <td>inline <code>style</code>

If several <code>@font-face</code> rules with the same descriptor are defined, only the most appropriate <code>@font-face</code>, as a whole, is considered.
