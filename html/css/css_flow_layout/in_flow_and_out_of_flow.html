<p>The following example contains a heading, a paragraph, a list, and a final paragraph that contains a <code>strong</code> element. The heading and paragraphs are block level, the <code>strong</code> element inline. The list, which is displayed using flexbox to arrange the items into a row, is also participating in block and inline layout - the container has an outside <code>display</code> type of <code>block</code>.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="html">&lt;div class="box"&gt;

    over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the
    grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney.

The box of our paragraph is still displaying according to the rules of normal flow. This is why, to make space around a floated item, you must add a margin to the item, in order to push the line boxes away from it. You cannot apply anything to the following in-flow content to achieve that.</p>

<p>Giving an item <code>position: absolute</code> or <code>position: fixed</code> removes it from flow, and any space that it would have taken up is removed.

Whether that involves clearing floats, or ensuring that an element with <code>position: absolute</code> does not sit on top of some other content. For this reason methods which remove elements from being in-flow should be used with understanding of the effect that they have.</p>
