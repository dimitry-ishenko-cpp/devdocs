<header><h1>Flow layout and writing modes</h1></header><div class="section-content">
<p>The CSS 2.1 specification, which details how normal flow behaves, assumes a horizontal writing mode. <a href="block_and_inline_layout_in_normal_flow.html">Layout</a> properties should work in the same way in vertical writing modes. In this guide, we look at how flow layout behaves when used with different document writing modes.</p> <p>This is not a comprehensive guide to the use of writing modes in CSS, the aim here is to document the areas where flow layout interacts with writing modes in possibly unanticipated ways. The <a href="#see_also">See also</a> section provides links to more writing modes resources.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="writing_modes_specification"><h2 id="writing_modes_specification">Writing modes specification</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>The CSS Writing Modes Level 3 Specification defines the impact a change the document writing mode has on flow layout. In the writing modes introduction, <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-writing-modes-3/#text-flow" target="_blank">the specification says</a>,</p> <blockquote> <p>"A writing mode in CSS is determined by the <a href="../writing-mode.html"><code>writing-mode</code></a>, <a href="../direction.html"><code>direction</code></a>, and <a href="../text-orientation.html"><code>text-orientation</code></a> properties. It is defined primarily in terms of its inline base direction and block flow direction."</p> </blockquote> <p>The specification defines the <em>inline base direction</em> as the direction in which content is ordered on a line. This defines the start and end of the inline direction. The start is where sentences start and the end is where a line of text ends before it would begin to wrap onto a new line.</p> <p>The <em>block flow direction</em> is the direction in which boxes, for example paragraphs, stack in that writing mode. The CSS writing-mode property controls the block flow direction. If you want to change your page, or part of your page, to <code>vertical-lr</code> then you can set <code>writing-mode: vertical-lr</code> on the element and this will change the direction of the blocks and therefore the inline direction as well.</p> <p>While certain languages will use a particular writing mode or text direction, we can also use these properties for creative effect, such as running a heading vertically.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="html">&lt;div class="box"&gt;

    One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
    over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the
    grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names
    were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and
    were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all
    scientific knowledge and new discovery.

<div class="section-content"><p>In most cases, flow layout works as you would expect it to when changing the writing mode of the document or parts of the document. This can be used to properly typeset vertical languages or for creative reasons. CSS is making this easier by way of introducing logical properties and values so that when working in a vertical writing mode sizing can be based on element's inline and block size. This will be useful when creating components which can work in different writing-modes.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="see_also"><h2 id="see_also">See also</h2>
