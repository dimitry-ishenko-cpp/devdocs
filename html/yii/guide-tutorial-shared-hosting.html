</ol></div> <p>Shared hosting environments are often quite limited about configuration and directory structure. Still in most cases you can run Yii 2.0 on a shared hosting environment with a few adjustments.</p> <h2>Deploying a basic project template 
</h2>
<p>Since in a shared hosting environment there's typically only one webroot, use the basic project template if you can. Refer to the <a href="guide-start-installation.html">Installing Yii chapter</a> and install the basic project template locally. After you have the application working locally, we'll make some adjustments so it can be hosted on your shared hosting server.</p> <h3>Renaming webroot 
</h3>
<p>Connect to your shared host using FTP or by other means. You will probably see something like the following.</p> <pre data-language="php">config
logs
www
</pre> <p>In the above, <code>www</code> is your webserver webroot directory. It could be named differently. Common names are: <code>www</code>, <code>htdocs</code>, and <code>public_html</code>.</p> <p>The webroot in our basic project template is named <code>web</code>. Before uploading the application to your webserver rename your local webroot to match your server, i.e., from <code>web</code> to <code>www</code>, <code>public_html</code> or whatever the name of your hosting webroot.</p> <h3>FTP root directory is writeable 
</h3>
<p>If you can write to the root level directory i.e. where <code>config</code>, <code>logs</code> and <code>www</code> are, then upload <code>assets</code>, <code>commands</code> etc. as is to the root level directory.</p> <h3>Add extras for webserver 
</h3>
<p>If your webserver is Apache you'll need to add an <code>.htaccess</code> file with the following content to <code>web</code> (or <code>public_html</code> or whatever) (where the <code>index.php</code> file is located):</p> <pre data-language="php">Options +FollowSymLinks
IndexIgnore */*

RewriteEngine on

# if a directory or a file exists, use it directly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# otherwise forward it to index.php
RewriteRule . index.php
</pre> <p>In case of nginx you should not need any extra config files.</p> <h3>Check requirements 
</h3>
<p>In order to run Yii, your webserver must meet its requirements. The very minimum requirement is PHP 5.4. In order to check the requirements copy <code>requirements.php</code> from your root directory into the webroot directory and run it via browser using <code>http://example.com/requirements.php</code> URL. Don't forget to delete the file afterwards.</p> <h2>Deploying an advanced project template 
</h2>
<p>Deploying an advanced application to shared hosting is a bit trickier than a basic application but it could be achieved. Follow instructions described in <a href="https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced/blob/master/docs/guide/topic-shared-hosting.md">advanced project template documentation</a>.</p> <div class="_attribution">
