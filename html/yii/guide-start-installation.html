</ol></div> <p>You can install Yii in two ways, using the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> package manager or by downloading an archive file. The former is the preferred way, as it allows you to install new <a href="guide-structure-extensions.html">extensions</a> or update Yii by simply running a single command.</p> <p>Standard installations of Yii result in both the framework and a project template being downloaded and installed. A project template is a working Yii project implementing some basic features, such as login, contact form, etc. Its code is organized in a recommended way. Therefore, it can serve as a good starting point for your projects.</p> <p>In this and the next few sections, we will describe how to install Yii with the so-called <em>Basic Project Template</em> and how to implement new features on top of this template. Yii also provides another template called the <a href="https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced/blob/master/docs/guide/README.md">Advanced Project Template</a> which is better used in a team development environment to develop applications with multiple tiers.</p> <blockquote class="info">
<p><strong>Info: </strong>The Basic Project Template is suitable for developing 90 percent of Web applications. It differs from the Advanced Project Template mainly in how their code is organized. If you are new to Yii, we strongly recommend you stick to the Basic Project Template for its simplicity yet sufficient functionalities.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Installing via Composer 
</h2>
<h3>Installing Composer 
</h3>
<p>If you do not already have Composer installed, you may do so by following the instructions at <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">getcomposer.org</a>. On Linux and Mac OS X, you'll run the following commands:</p> <pre data-language="php">curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
</pre> <p>On Windows, you'll download and run <a href="https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe">Composer-Setup.exe</a>.</p> <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md">Troubleshooting section of the Composer Documentation</a> if you encounter any problems. If you are new to Composer, we also recommend to read at least the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md">Basic usage section</a> of the Composer documentation.</p> <p>In this guide all composer commands assume you have installed composer <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally">globally</a> so that it is available as the <code>composer</code> command. If you are using the <code>composer.phar</code> in the local directory instead, you have to adjust the example commands accordingly.</p> <p>If you had Composer already installed before, make sure you use an up to date version. You can update Composer by running <code>composer self-update</code>.</p> <blockquote class="note">
<p><strong>Note: </strong>During the installation of Yii, Composer will need to request a lot of information from the Github API. The number of requests depends on the number of dependencies your application has and may be bigger than the <strong>Github API rate limit</strong>. If you hit this limit, Composer may ask for your Github login credentials to obtain a Github API access token. On fast connections you may hit this limit earlier than Composer can handle so we recommend to configure the access token before installing Yii. Please refer to the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#api-rate-limit-and-oauth-tokens">Composer documentation about Github API tokens</a> for instructions on how to do this.</p> </blockquote> <h3>Installing Yii 
</h3>
<p>With Composer installed, you can install Yii application template by running the following command under a Web-accessible folder:</p> <pre data-language="php">composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
</pre> <p>This will install the latest stable version of Yii application template in a directory named <code>basic</code>. You can choose a different directory name if you want.</p> <blockquote class="info">
<p><strong>Info: </strong>If the <code>composer create-project</code> command fails you may also refer to the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md">Troubleshooting section of the Composer Documentation</a> for common errors. When you have fixed the error, you can resume the aborted installation by running <code>composer update</code> inside of the <code>basic</code> directory.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="tip">
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>If you want to install the latest development version of Yii, you may use the following command instead, which adds a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability">stability option</a>:</p> <pre data-language="php">composer create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
</pre> <p>Note that the development version of Yii should not be used for production as it may break your running code.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Installing from an Archive File 
</h2>
<p>Installing Yii from an archive file involves three steps:</p> <ol> <li>Download the archive file from <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/download/">yiiframework.com</a>.</li> <li>Unpack the downloaded file to a Web-accessible folder.</li> <li>
<p>Modify the <code>config/web.php</code> file by entering a secret key for the <code>cookieValidationKey</code> configuration item (this is done automatically if you are installing Yii using Composer):</p> <pre data-language="php">// !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
'cookieValidationKey' =&gt; 'enter your secret key here',
</pre> </li> </ol> <h2>Other Installation Options 
</h2>
<p>The above installation instructions show how to install Yii, which also creates a basic Web application that works out of the box. This approach is a good starting point for most projects, either small or big. It is especially suitable if you just start learning Yii.</p> <p>But there are other installation options available:</p> <ul> <li>If you only want to install the core framework and would like to build an entire application from scratch, you may follow the instructions as explained in <a href="guide-tutorial-start-from-scratch.html">Building Application from Scratch</a>.</li> <li>If you want to start with a more sophisticated application, better suited to team development environments, you may consider installing the <a href="https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced/blob/master/docs/guide/README.md">Advanced Project Template</a>.</li> </ul> <h2>Verifying the Installation 
</h2>
<p>After installation is done, either configure your web server (see next section) or use the <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php">built-in PHP web server</a> by running the following console command while in the project <code>web</code> directory:</p> <pre data-language="php">php yii serve
</pre> <blockquote class="note">
<p><strong>Note: </strong>By default the HTTP-server will listen to port 8080. However if that port is already in use or you wish to serve multiple applications this way, you might want to specify what port to use. Just add the --port argument:</p> </blockquote> <pre data-language="php">php yii serve --port=8888
</pre> <p>You can use your browser to access the installed Yii application with the following URL:</p> <pre data-language="php">http://localhost:8080/
</pre> <p><img src="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/images/start-app-installed.png" alt="Successful Installation of Yii"></p> <p>You should see the above "Congratulations!" page in your browser. If not, please check if your PHP installation satisfies Yii's requirements. You can check if the minimum requirements are met using one of the following approaches:</p> <ul> <li>Copy <code>/requirements.php</code> to <code>/web/requirements.php</code> and then use a browser to access it via <code>http://localhost/requirements.php</code>
</li> <li>
<p>Run the following commands:</p> <pre data-language="php">cd basic
php requirements.php
</pre> </li> </ul> <p>You should configure your PHP installation so that it meets the minimum requirements of Yii. Most importantly, you should have PHP 5.4 or above. Ideally latest PHP 7. You should also install the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php">PDO PHP Extension</a> and a corresponding database driver (such as <code>pdo_mysql</code> for MySQL databases), if your application needs a database.</p> <h2>Configuring Web Servers 
</h2>
<blockquote class="info">
<p><strong>Info: </strong>You may skip this subsection for now if you are just test driving Yii with no intention of deploying it to a production server.</p> </blockquote> <p>The application installed according to the above instructions should work out of box with either an <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP server</a> or an <a href="http://nginx.org/">Nginx HTTP server</a>, on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux running PHP 5.4 or higher. Yii 2.0 is also compatible with facebook's <a href="http://hhvm.com/">HHVM</a>. However, there are some edge cases where HHVM behaves different than native PHP, so you have to take some extra care when using HHVM.</p> <p>On a production server, you may want to configure your Web server so that the application can be accessed via the URL <code>http://www.example.com/index.php</code> instead of <code>http://www.example.com/basic/web/index.php</code>. Such configuration requires pointing the document root of your Web server to the <code>basic/web</code> folder. You may also want to hide <code>index.php</code> from the URL, as described in the <a href="guide-runtime-routing.html">Routing and URL Creation</a> section. In this subsection, you'll learn how to configure your Apache or Nginx server to achieve these goals.</p> <blockquote class="info">
<p><strong>Info: </strong>By setting <code>basic/web</code> as the document root, you also prevent end users from accessing your private application code and sensitive data files that are stored in the sibling directories of <code>basic/web</code>. Denying access to those other folders is a security improvement.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="info">
<p><strong>Info: </strong>If your application will run in a shared hosting environment where you do not have permission to modify its Web server configuration, you may still adjust the structure of your application for better security. Please refer to the <a href="guide-tutorial-shared-hosting.html">Shared Hosting Environment</a> section for more details.</p> </blockquote> <h3>Recommended Apache Configuration 
</h3>
<p>Use the following configuration in Apache's <code>httpd.conf</code> file or within a virtual host configuration. Note that you should replace <code>path/to/basic/web</code> with the actual path for <code>basic/web</code>.</p> <pre data-language="php"># Set document root to be "basic/web"
DocumentRoot "path/to/basic/web"

&lt;Directory "path/to/basic/web"&gt;
    # use mod_rewrite for pretty URL support
    RewriteEngine on
    # If a directory or a file exists, use the request directly
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    # Otherwise forward the request to index.php
    RewriteRule . index.php

    # ...other settings...
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre> <h3>Recommended Nginx Configuration 
</h3>
<p>To use <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/">Nginx</a>, you should install PHP as an <a href="http://php.net/install.fpm">FPM SAPI</a>. You may use the following Nginx configuration, replacing <code>path/to/basic/web</code> with the actual path for <code>basic/web</code> and <code>mysite.local</code> with the actual hostname to serve.</p> <pre data-language="php">server {
    charset utf-8;
    client_max_body_size 128M;

    listen 80; ## listen for ipv4
    #listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on; ## listen for ipv6

    server_name mysite.local;
    root        /path/to/basic/web;
    index       index.php;

    access_log  /path/to/basic/log/access.log;
    error_log   /path/to/basic/log/error.log;

    location / {
        # Redirect everything that isn't a real file to index.php
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    # uncomment to avoid processing of calls to non-existing static files by Yii
    #location ~ \.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|swf|ico|pdf|mov|fla|zip|rar)$ {
    #    try_files $uri =404;
    #}
    #error_page 404 /404.html;

    # deny accessing php files for the /assets directory
    location ~ ^/assets/.*\.php$ {
        deny all;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        #fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
        try_files $uri =404;
    }

    location ~* /\. {
        deny all;
    }
}
</pre> <p>When using this configuration, you should also set <code>cgi.fix_pathinfo=0</code> in the <code>php.ini</code> file in order to avoid many unnecessary system <code>stat()</code> calls.</p> <p>Also note that when running an HTTPS server, you need to add <code>fastcgi_param HTTPS on;</code> so that Yii can properly detect if a connection is secure.</p> <div class="_attribution">
