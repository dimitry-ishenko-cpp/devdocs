<h1 id="page-subtitle">function file_munge_filename</h1>     <pre class="signature">file_munge_filename($filename, $extensions, $alerts = TRUE)</pre> <p>Modifies a filename as needed for security purposes.</p> <p>Munging a file name prevents unknown file extensions from masking exploit files. When web servers such as Apache decide how to process a URL request, they use the file extension. If the extension is not recognized, Apache skips that extension and uses the previous file extension. For example, if the file being requested is exploit.php.pps, and Apache does not recognize the '.pps' extension, it treats the file as PHP and executes it. To make this file name safe for Apache and prevent it from executing as PHP, the .php extension is "munged" into .php_, making the safe file name exploit.php_.pps.</p> <p>Specifically, this function adds an underscore to all extensions that are between 2 and 5 characters in length, internal to the file name, and not included in $extensions.</p> <p>Function behavior is also controlled by the configuration 'system.file:allow_insecure_uploads'. If it evaluates to TRUE, no alterations will be made, if it evaluates to FALSE, the filename is 'munged'. *</p> <h3>Parameters</h3> <p> <strong>$filename</strong>: File name to modify.</p> <p><strong>$extensions</strong>: A space-separated list of extensions that should not be altered.</p> <p><strong>$alerts</strong>: If TRUE, <a href="../../../core-includes-bootstrap.inc/function/drupal_set_message/8.1.x.html" title="Sets a message to display to the user." class="local">drupal_set_message</a>() will be called to display a message if the file name was changed.</p> <h3>Return value</h3> <p> string The potentially modified $filename.</p> <h3>Related topics</h3>   <dl api-related-topics> <dt><a href="../../group/file/8.1.x.html">File interface</a></dt> <dd>Common file handling functions.</dd> </dl>    <h3>File</h3>
