<h1 id="page-subtitle">function update_resolve_dependencies</h1>     <pre class="signature">update_resolve_dependencies($starting_updates)</pre> <p>Resolves dependencies in a set of module updates, and orders them correctly.</p> <p>This function receives a list of requested module updates and determines an appropriate order to run them in such that all update dependencies are met. Any updates whose dependencies cannot be met are included in the returned array but have the key 'allowed' set to FALSE; the calling function should take responsibility for ensuring that these updates are ultimately not performed.</p> <p>In addition, the returned array also includes detailed information about the dependency chain for each update, as provided by the depth-first search algorithm in <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-component-graph-graph.php/function/graph-searchandsort/8.1.x.html" title="Performs a depth-first search and sort on the directed acyclic graph." class="local">Drupal\Component\Graph\Graph::searchAndSort</a>().</p> <h3>Parameters</h3> <p> <strong>$starting_updates</strong>: An array whose keys contain the names of modules with updates to be run and whose values contain the number of the first requested update for that module.</p> <h3>Return value</h3> <p> An array whose keys are the names of all update functions within the provided modules that would need to be run in order to fulfill the request, arranged in the order in which the update functions should be run. (This includes the provided starting update for each module and all subsequent updates that are available.) The values are themselves arrays containing all the keys provided by the <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-component-graph-graph.php/function/graph-searchandsort/8.1.x.html" title="Performs a depth-first search and sort on the directed acyclic graph." class="local">Drupal\Component\Graph\Graph::searchAndSort</a>() algorithm, which encode detailed information about the dependency chain for this update function (for example: 'paths', 'reverse_paths', 'weight', and 'component'), as well as the following additional keys:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>'allowed'</strong>: A boolean which is TRUE when the update function's dependencies are met, and FALSE otherwise. Calling functions should inspect this value before running the update.</li> <li>
<strong>'missing_dependencies'</strong>: An array containing the names of any other update functions that are required by this one but that are unavailable to be run. This array will be empty when 'allowed' is TRUE.</li> <li>
<strong>'module'</strong>: The name of the module that this update function belongs to.</li> <li>
<strong>'number'</strong>: The number of this update function within that module.</li> </ul> <h3>See also</h3> <p> <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-component-graph-graph.php/function/graph-searchandsort/8.1.x.html" title="Performs a depth-first search and sort on the directed acyclic graph." class="local">\Drupal\Component\Graph\Graph::searchAndSort</a>()</p>  <h3>File</h3>
