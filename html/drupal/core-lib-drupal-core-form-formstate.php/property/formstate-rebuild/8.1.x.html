<h1 id="page-subtitle">protected property FormState::$rebuild</h1>      <p>Normally, after the entire form processing is completed and submit handlers have run, a form is considered to be done and <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-form-formsubmitterinterface.php/function/formsubmitterinterface-redirectform/8.1.x.html" title="Redirects the user to a URL after a form has been processed." class="local">\Drupal\Core\Form\FormSubmitterInterface::redirectForm</a>() will redirect the user to a new page using a GET request (so a browser refresh does not re-submit the form). However, if 'rebuild' has been set to TRUE, then a new copy of the form is immediately built and sent to the browser, instead of a redirect. This is used for multi-step forms, such as wizards and confirmation forms. Normally, self::$rebuild is set by a submit handler, since its is usually logic within a submit handler that determines whether a form is done or requires another step. However, a validation handler may already set self::$rebuild to cause the form processing to bypass submit handlers and rebuild the form instead, even if there are no validation errors.</p> <p>This property is uncacheable.</p> <p><strong>Type:</strong> bool</p> <h3>See also</h3> <p> self::setRebuild()</p> <h3>File</h3>
