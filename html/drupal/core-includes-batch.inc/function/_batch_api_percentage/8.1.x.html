<h1 id="page-subtitle">function _batch_api_percentage</h1>     <pre class="signature">_batch_api_percentage($total, $current)</pre> <p>Formats the percent completion for a batch set.</p> <h3>Parameters</h3> <p> <strong>int $total</strong>: The total number of operations.</p> <p><strong>int|float $current</strong>: The number of the current operation. This may be a floating point number rather than an integer in the case of a multi-step operation that is not yet complete; in that case, the fractional part of $current represents the fraction of the operation that has been completed.</p> <h3>Return value</h3> <p> string The properly formatted percentage, as a string. We output percentages using the correct number of decimal places so that we never print "100%" until we are finished, but we also never print more decimal places than are meaningful.</p> <h3>See also</h3> <p> <a href="../_batch_process/8.1.x.html" title="Processes sets in a batch." class="local">_batch_process</a>()</p>  <h3>File</h3>
