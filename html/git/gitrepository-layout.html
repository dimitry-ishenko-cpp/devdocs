This mechanism is called a <code>gitfile</code> and is usually managed via the <code>git submodule</code> and <code>git worktree</code> commands. It is often used for a working tree of a submodule checkout, to allow you in the containing superproject to <code>git checkout</code> a branch that does not have the submodule. The <code>checkout</code> has to remove the entire submodule working tree, without losing the submodule repository.</p>   <p>These things may exist in a Git repository.</p>  <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitrepository-layout.txt-objects"> objects </dt> <dd> <p>Object store associated with this repository.

A repository with this kind of incomplete object store is not suitable to be published for use with dumb transports but otherwise is OK as long as <code>objects/info/alternates</code> points at the object stores it borrows from.</p>  <p>This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/objects" will be used instead.</p>  </li> </ol> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitrepository-layout.txt-objects0-9a-f0-9a-f"> objects/[0-9a-f][0-9a-f] </dt> <dd> <p>A newly created object is stored in its own file.

It is legal if the named branch <code>name</code> does not (yet) exist. In some legacy setups, it is a symbolic link instead of a symref that points at the current branch.</p>  <p>HEAD can also record a specific commit directly, instead of being a symref to point at the current branch.

This version specifies the rules for operating on the on-disk repository data. An implementation of git which does not understand a particular version advertised by an on-disk repository MUST NOT operate on that repository; doing so risks not only producing wrong results, but actually losing data.</p>   <p>Because of this rule, version bumps should be kept to an absolute minimum. Instead, we generally prefer these strategies:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>bumping format version numbers of individual data files (e.g., index, packfiles, etc). This restricts the incompatibilities only to those files.</p> </li> <li> <p>introducing new data that gracefully degrades when used by older clients (e.g., pack bitmap files are ignored by older clients, which simply do not take advantage of the optimization they provide).</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>A whole-repository format version bump should only be part of a change that cannot be independently versioned. For instance, if one were to change the reachability rules for objects, or the rules for locking refs, that would require a bump of the repository format version.</p>   <p>Note that this applies only to accessing the repository’s disk contents directly. An older client which understands only format <code>0</code> may still connect via <code>git://</code> to a repository using format <code>1</code>, as long as the server process understands format <code>1</code>.</p>   <p>The preferred strategy for rolling out a version bump (whether whole repository or for a single file) is to teach git to read the new format, and allow writing the new format with a config switch or command line option (for experimentation or for those who do not care about backwards compatibility with older gits). Then after a long period to allow the reading capability to become common, we may switch to writing the new format by default.</p>   <p>The currently defined format versions are:</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_version_0">
Version <code>0</code>
</h3>  <p>This is the format defined by the initial version of git, including but not limited to the format of the repository directory, the repository configuration file, and the object and ref storage. Specifying the complete behavior of git is beyond the scope of this document.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_version_1">
Version <code>1</code>
</h3>  <p>This format is identical to version <code>0</code>, with the following exceptions:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>When reading the <code>core.repositoryformatversion</code> variable, a git implementation which supports version 1 MUST also read any configuration keys found in the <code>extensions</code> section of the configuration file.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a version-1 repository specifies any <code>extensions.*</code> keys that the running git has not implemented, the operation MUST NOT proceed. Similarly, if the value of any known key is not understood by the implementation, the operation MUST NOT proceed.</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>Note that if no extensions are specified in the config file, then <code>core.repositoryformatversion</code> SHOULD be set to <code>0</code> (setting it to <code>1</code> provides no benefit, and makes the repository incompatible with older implementations of git).</p>   <p>The defined extensions are given in the <code>extensions.*</code> section of <a href="git-config.html">git-config[1]</a>.
