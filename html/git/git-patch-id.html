As such, itâ€™s "reasonably stable", but at the same time also reasonably unique, i.e., two patches that have the same "patch ID" are almost guaranteed to be the same thing.</p>   <p>The main usecase for this command is to look for likely duplicate commits.</p>   <p>When dealing with <code>git diff-tree</code> output, it takes advantage of the fact that the patch is prefixed with the object name of the commit, and outputs two 40-byte hexadecimal strings. The first string is the patch ID, and the second string is the commit ID. This can be used to make a mapping from patch ID to commit ID.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_options">Options</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-patch-id.txt---verbatim"> --verbatim </dt> <dd> <p>Calculate the patch-id of the input as it is given, do not strip any whitespace.</p> <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>This is the default if patchid.verbatim is true.</pre> </div> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-patch-id.txt---stable"> --stable </dt> <dd> <p>Use a "stable" sum of hashes as the patch ID. With this option:</p> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Reordering file diffs that make up a patch does not affect the ID. In particular, two patches produced by comparing the same two trees with two different settings for "-O&lt;orderfile&gt;" result in the same patch ID signature, thereby allowing the computed result to be used as a key to index some meta-information about the change between the two trees;</p> </li> <li> <p>Result is different from the value produced by git 1.9 and older or produced when an "unstable" hash (see --unstable below) is configured - even when used on a diff output taken without any use of "-O&lt;orderfile&gt;", thereby making existing databases storing such "unstable" or historical patch-ids unusable.</p> </li> <li> <p>All whitespace within the patch is ignored and does not affect the id.</p> <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>This is the default if patchid.stable is set to true.</pre> </div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-patch-id.txt---unstable"> --unstable </dt> <dd> <p>Use an "unstable" hash as the patch ID. With this option, the result produced is compatible with the patch-id value produced by git 1.9 and older and whitespace is ignored. Users with pre-existing databases storing patch-ids produced by git 1.9 and older (who do not deal with reordered patches) may want to use this option.</p> <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>This is the default.</pre> </div> </div> </dd> </dl> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
