Two commits are said to correspond when the diff between their patches (i.e. the author information, the commit message and the commit diff) is reasonably small compared to the patches' size. See ``Algorithm`` below for details.</p>   <p>Finally, the list of matching commits is shown in the order of the second commit range, with unmatched commits being inserted just after all of their ancestors have been shown.</p>   <p>There are three ways to specify the commit ranges:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p><code>&lt;range1&gt; &lt;range2&gt;</code>: Either commit range can be of the form <code>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;rev&gt;^!</code> or <code>&lt;rev&gt;^-&lt;n&gt;</code>.

It is intended to be human-readable porcelain output, not something that can be used across versions of Git to get a textually stable <code>range-diff</code> (as opposed to something like the <code>--stable</code> option to <a href="git-patch-id.html">git-patch-id[1]</a>). There’s also no equivalent of <a href="git-apply.html">git-apply[1]</a> for <code>range-diff</code>, the output is not intended to be machine-readable.</p>   <p>This is particularly true when passing in diff options. Currently some options like <code>--stat</code> can, as an emergent effect, produce output that’s quite useless in the context of <code>range-diff</code>. Future versions of <code>range-diff</code> may learn to interpret such options in a manner specific to <code>range-diff</code> (e.g. for <code>--stat</code> producing human-readable output which summarizes how the diffstat changed).</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_configuration">Configuration</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>This command uses the <code>diff.color.*</code> and <code>pager.range-diff</code> settings (the latter is on by default).

3:  bedead &lt; -:  ------- TO-UNDO</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In this example, there are 3 old and 3 new commits, where the developer removed the 3rd, added a new one before the first two, and modified the commit message of the 2nd commit as well its diff.</p>   <p>When the output goes to a terminal, it is color-coded by default, just like regular <code>git diff</code>'s output. In addition, the first line (adding a commit) is green, the last line (deleting a commit) is red, the second line (with a perfect match) is yellow like the commit header of <code>git
show</code>'s output, and the third line colors the old commit red, the new one green and the rest like <code>git show</code>'s commit header.</p>   <p>A naive color-coded diff of diffs is actually a bit hard to read, though, as it colors the entire lines red or green. The line that added "What is unexpected" in the old commit, for example, is completely red, even if the intent of the old commit was to add something.</p>   <p>To help with that, <code>range</code> uses the <code>--dual-color</code> mode by default. In this mode, the diff of diffs will retain the original diff colors, and prefix the lines with -/+ markers that have their <strong>background</strong> red or green, to make it more obvious that they describe how the diff itself changed.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_algorithm">Algorithm</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>The general idea is this: we generate a cost matrix between the commits in both commit ranges, then solve the least-cost assignment.</p>   <p>The cost matrix is populated thusly: for each pair of commits, both diffs are generated and the "diff of diffs" is generated, with 3 context lines, then the number of lines in that diff is used as cost.</p>   <p>To avoid false positives (e.g. when a patch has been removed, and an unrelated patch has been added between two iterations of the same patch series), the cost matrix is extended to allow for that, by adding fixed-cost entries for wholesale deletes/adds.</p>   <p>Example: Let commits <code>1--2</code> be the first iteration of a patch series and <code>A--C</code> the second iteration. Let’s assume that <code>A</code> is a cherry-pick of <code>2,</code> and <code>C</code> is a cherry-pick of <code>1</code> but with a small modification (say, a fixed typo). Visualize the commits as a bipartite graph:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    1            A

    2            B

                 C</pre> </div> </div>  <p>We are looking for a "best" explanation of the new series in terms of the old one. We can represent an "explanation" as an edge in the graph:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    1            A
               /
    2 --------'  B

                 C</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This explanation comes for "free" because there was no change. Similarly <code>C</code> could be explained using <code>1</code>, but that comes at some cost c&gt;0 because of the modification:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    1 ----.      A
          |    /
    2 ----+---'  B
          |
          `----- C
          c&gt;0</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In mathematical terms, what we are looking for is some sort of a minimum cost bipartite matching; <code>1</code> is matched to <code>C</code> at some cost, etc. The underlying graph is in fact a complete bipartite graph; the cost we associate with every edge is the size of the diff between the two commits' patches. To explain also new commits, we introduce dummy nodes on both sides:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    1 ----.      A
          |    /
    2 ----+---'  B
          |
    o     `----- C
          c&gt;0
    o            o

    o            o</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The cost of an edge <code>o--C</code> is the size of <code>C</code>'s diff, modified by a fudge factor that should be smaller than 100%. The cost of an edge <code>o--o</code> is free. The fudge factor is necessary because even if <code>1</code> and <code>C</code> have nothing in common, they may still share a few empty lines and such, possibly making the assignment <code>1--C</code>, <code>o--o</code> slightly cheaper than <code>1--o</code>, <code>o--C</code> even if <code>1</code> and <code>C</code> have nothing in common. With the fudge factor we require a much larger common part to consider patches as corresponding.</p>   <p>The overall time needed to compute this algorithm is the time needed to compute n+m commit diffs and then n*m diffs of patches, plus the time needed to compute the least-cost assignment between n and m diffs. Git uses an implementation of the Jonker-Volgenant algorithm to solve the assignment problem, which has cubic runtime complexity. The matching found in this case will look like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    1 ----.      A
          |    /
    2 ----+---'  B
       .--+-----'
    o -'  `----- C
