<h1>Interface DriverAction</h1>      <br> <pre data-language="java">public interface DriverAction</pre> <div>
<p>An interface that must be implemented when a <a href="driver.html">Driver</a> wants to be notified by <code>DriverManager</code>. </p>
<p> A <code>DriverAction</code> implementation is not intended to be used directly by applications. A JDBC Driver may choose to create its <code>DriverAction</code> implementation in a private class to avoid it being called directly. </p>
<p> The JDBC driver's static initialization block must call <a href="drivermanager.html#registerDriver-java.sql.Driver-java.sql.DriverAction-">DriverManager.registerDriver(java.sql.Driver, java.sql.DriverAction)</a> in order to inform <code>DriverManager</code> which <code>DriverAction</code> implementation to call when the JDBC driver is de-registered.</p>

<code><a href="driveraction.html#deregister--">deregister</a>()</code> <p>Method called by <a href="drivermanager.html#deregisterDriver-java.sql.Driver-">DriverManager.deregisterDriver(Driver)</a> to notify the JDBC driver that it was de-registered.</p> </td> </tr> </table>    <div>    <h2 id="method.detail">Methods</h2>   <h3 id="deregister--">deregister</h3> <pre data-language="java">voidÂ deregister()</pre> <div>
<p>Method called by <a href="drivermanager.html#deregisterDriver-java.sql.Driver-">DriverManager.deregisterDriver(Driver)</a> to notify the JDBC driver that it was de-registered. </p>
<p> The <code>deregister</code> method is intended only to be used by JDBC Drivers and not by applications. JDBC drivers are recommended to not implement <code>DriverAction</code> in a public class. If there are active connections to the database at the time that the <code>deregister</code> method is called, it is implementation specific as to whether the connections are closed or allowed to continue. Once this method is called, it is implementation specific as to whether the driver may limit the ability to create new connections to the database, invoke other <code>Driver</code> methods or throw a <code>SQLException</code>. Consult your JDBC driver's documentation for additional information on its behavior.</p>
