  <h2 id="package.description">Package java.applet Description</h2> <div>
<p>Provides the classes necessary to create an applet and the classes an applet uses to communicate with its applet context. </p>
<p> The applet framework involves two entities: the <i>applet</i> and the <i>applet context</i>. An applet is an embeddable window (see the Panel class) with a few extra methods that the applet context can use to initialize, start, and stop the applet. </p>
<p> The applet context is an application that is responsible for loading and running applets. For example, the applet context could be a Web browser or an applet development environment. </p>
