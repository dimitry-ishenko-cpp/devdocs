  <h2 id="package.description">Package org.omg.PortableServer.CurrentPackage Description</h2> <div>

<p> Provides method implementations with access to the identity of the object on which the method was invoked. The <code>Current</code> package supports servants that implement multiple objects, but can be used within the context of POA-dispatched method invocations on any servant. To provide location transparency, ORBs are required to support use of <code>Current</code> in the context of both locally and remotely invoked operations. An instance of <code>Current</code> can be obtained by the application by issuing the <code>CORBA::ORB::resolve_initial_references("POACurrent")</code> operation. Thereafter, it can be used within the context of a method dispatched by the POA to obtain the <code>POA</code> and <code>ObjectId</code> that identify the object on which that operation was invoked. </p>
