<p> This package is implemented by a MIME-based package processor that enables the interpretation and creation of optimized binary data within an MIME-based package format. </p>
<p> Soap MTOM[1], XOP([2][3]) and WS-I AP[4] standardize approaches to optimized transmission of binary datatypes as an attachment. To optimally support these standards within a message passing environment, this package enables an integrated solution between a MIME-based package processor and JAXB unmarshall/marshal processes. </p>
