  <div id="layout"> <div id="layout-content"> <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2> <p class="para"> The syntax and semantics of the regular expressions supported by PCRE are described below. Regular expressions are also described in the Perl documentation and in a number of other books, some of which have copious examples. Jeffrey Friedl's "Mastering Regular Expressions", published by O'Reilly (ISBN 1-56592-257-3), covers them in great detail. The description here is intended as reference documentation. </p> <p class="para"> A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject string from left to right. Most characters stand for themselves in a pattern, and match the corresponding characters in the subject. As a trivial example, the pattern <code class="literal">The quick brown fox</code> matches a portion of a subject string that is identical to itself. </p> </div>
