  <div id="layout"> <div id="layout-content"> <h2 class="title">Meta-characters</h2> <p class="para"> The power of regular expressions comes from the ability to include alternatives and repetitions in the pattern. These are encoded in the pattern by the use of <em>meta-characters</em>, which do not stand for themselves but instead are interpreted in some special way. </p> <p class="para"> There are two different sets of meta-characters: those that are recognized anywhere in the pattern except within square brackets, and those that are recognized in square brackets. Outside square brackets, the meta-characters are as follows: </p>
<table class="doctable table"> <caption><strong>Meta-characters outside square brackets</strong></caption> <thead> <tr> <th>Meta-character</th>
<th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody class="tbody"> <tr> <td>\</td>
<td>general escape character with several uses</td> </tr> <tr> <td>^</td>
<td>assert start of subject (or line, in multiline mode)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>$</td>
<td>assert end of subject or before a terminating newline (or end of line, in multiline mode)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>.</td>
<td>match any character except newline (by default)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>[</td>
<td>start character class definition</td> </tr> <tr> <td>]</td>
<td>end character class definition</td> </tr> <tr> <td>|</td>
<td>start of alternative branch</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(</td>
<td>start subpattern</td> </tr> <tr> <td>)</td>
<td>end subpattern</td> </tr> <tr> <td>?</td>
<td>extends the meaning of (, also 0 or 1 quantifier, also makes greedy quantifiers lazy (see <a href="regexp.reference.repetition.html" class="link">repetition</a>)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>*</td>
<td>0 or more quantifier</td> </tr> <tr> <td>+</td>
<td>1 or more quantifier</td> </tr> <tr> <td>{</td>
<td>start min/max quantifier</td> </tr> <tr> <td>}</td>
<td>end min/max quantifier</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Part of a pattern that is in square brackets is called a <a href="regexp.reference.character-classes.html" class="link">character class</a>. In a character class the only meta-characters are: <table class="doctable table"> <caption><strong>Meta-characters inside square brackets (<em>character classes</em>)</strong></caption> <thead> <tr> <th>Meta-character</th>
<th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody class="tbody"> <tr> <td>\</td>
<td>general escape character</td> </tr> <tr> <td>^</td>
<td>negate the class, but only if the first character</td> </tr> <tr> <td>-</td>
<td>indicates character range</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> The following sections describe the use of each of the meta-characters. </div>
