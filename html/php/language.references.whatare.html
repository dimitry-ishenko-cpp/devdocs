  <div id="layout"> <div id="layout-content"><div id="language.references.whatare" class="sect1"> <h2 class="title">What References Are</h2> <p class="simpara"> References in PHP are a means to access the same variable content by different names. They are not like C pointers; for instance, you cannot perform pointer arithmetic using them, they are not actual memory addresses, and so on. See <a href="language.references.arent.html" class="xref">What References Are Not</a> for more information. Instead, they are <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.gc.refcounting-basics.php" class="link">symbol table</a> aliases. Note that in PHP, variable name and variable content are different, so the same content can have different names. The closest analogy is with Unix filenames and files - variable names are directory entries, while variable content is the file itself. References can be likened to hardlinking in Unix filesystem. </p> </div></div>
