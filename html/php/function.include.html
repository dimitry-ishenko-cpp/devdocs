If the file isn't found in the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path" class="link">include_path</a>, <code class="literal">include</code> will finally check in the calling script's own directory and the current working directory before failing. The <code class="literal">include</code> construct will emit an <strong><code>E_WARNING</code></strong> if it cannot find a file; this is different behavior from <span class="function"><a href="function.require.html" class="function">require</a></span>, which will emit an <strong><code>E_ERROR</code></strong>. </p> <p class="simpara"> Note that both <code class="literal">include</code> and <code class="literal">require</code> raise additional <strong><code>E_WARNING</code></strong>s, if the file cannot be accessed, before raising the final <strong><code>E_WARNING</code></strong> or <strong><code>E_ERROR</code></strong>, respectively. </p> <p class="simpara"> If a path is defined — whether absolute (starting with a drive letter or <code class="literal">\</code> on Windows, or <code class="literal">/</code> on Unix/Linux systems) or relative to the current directory (starting with <code class="literal">.</code> or <code class="literal">..</code>) — the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path" class="link">include_path</a> will be ignored altogether. For example, if a filename begins with <code class="literal">../</code>, the parser will look in the parent directory to find the requested file. </p> <p class="simpara"> For more information on how PHP handles including files and the include path, see the documentation for <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path" class="link">include_path</a>. </p> <p class="simpara"> When a file is included, the code it contains inherits the <a href="language.variables.scope.html" class="link">variable scope</a> of the line on which the include occurs. Any variables available at that line in the calling file will be available within the called file, from that point forward. However, all functions and classes defined in the included file have the global scope. </p>

?&gt;</pre> </div> </div> <p class="simpara"> When a file is included, parsing drops out of PHP mode and into HTML mode at the beginning of the target file, and resumes again at the end. For this reason, any code inside the target file which should be executed as PHP code must be enclosed within <a href="language.basic-syntax.phpmode.html" class="link">valid PHP start and end tags</a>. </p> <p class="simpara"> If "<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php#ini.allow-url-include" class="link">URL include wrappers</a>" are enabled in PHP, you can specify the file to be included using a URL (via HTTP or other supported wrapper - see <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php" class="xref">Supported Protocols and Wrappers</a> for a list of protocols) instead of a local pathname. If the target server interprets the target file as PHP code, variables may be passed to the included file using a URL request string as used with HTTP GET. This is not strictly speaking the same thing as including the file and having it inherit the parent file's variable scope; the script is actually being run on the remote server and the result is then being included into the local script. </p>

<strong class="warning">Warning</strong> <h1 class="title">Security warning</h1> <p class="para"> Remote file may be processed at the remote server (depending on the file extension and the fact if the remote server runs PHP or not) but it still has to produce a valid PHP script because it will be processed at the local server. If the file from the remote server should be processed there and outputted only, <span class="function"><a href="function.readfile.html" class="function">readfile()</a></span> is much better function to use. Otherwise, special care should be taken to secure the remote script to produce a valid and desired code. </p> </div> <p class="para"> See also <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.remote-files.php" class="link">Remote files</a>, <span class="function"><a href="function.fopen.html" class="function">fopen()</a></span> and <span class="function"><a href="function.file.html" class="function">file()</a></span> for related information. </p> <p class="simpara"> Handling Returns: <code class="literal">include</code> returns <code class="literal">FALSE</code> on failure and raises a warning. Successful includes, unless overridden by the included file, return <code class="literal">1</code>. It is possible to execute a <span class="function"><a href="function.return.html" class="function">return</a></span> statement inside an included file in order to terminate processing in that file and return to the script which called it. Also, it's possible to return values from included files. You can take the value of the include call as you would for a normal function. This is not, however, possible when including remote files unless the output of the remote file has <a href="language.basic-syntax.phpmode.html" class="link">valid PHP start and end tags</a> (as with any local file). You can declare the needed variables within those tags and they will be introduced at whichever point the file was included. </p> <p class="para"> Because <code class="literal">include</code> is a special language construct, parentheses are not needed around its argument. Take care when comparing return value. </p>

?&gt;</pre> </div> </div> <p class="simpara"> <code class="literal">$bar</code> is the value <code class="literal">1</code> because the include was successful. Notice the difference between the above examples. The first uses <span class="function"><a href="function.return.html" class="function">return</a></span> within the included file while the other does not. If the file can't be included, <strong><code>false</code></strong> is returned and <strong><code>E_WARNING</code></strong> is issued. </p> <p class="para"> If there are functions defined in the included file, they can be used in the main file independent if they are before <span class="function"><a href="function.return.html" class="function">return</a></span> or after. If the file is included twice, PHP will raise a fatal error because the functions were already declared. It is recommended to use <span class="function"><a href="function.include-once.html" class="function">include_once</a></span> instead of checking if the file was already included and conditionally return inside the included file. </p> <p class="simpara"> Another way to "include" a PHP file into a variable is to capture the output by using the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.outcontrol.php" class="link">Output Control Functions</a> with <code class="literal">include</code>. For example: </p> 
<div class="example" id="example-431"> <p><strong>Example #6 Using output buffering to include a PHP file into a string</strong></p> <div class="example-contents"> <pre class="phpcode" data-language="php">&lt;?php
$string = get_include_contents('somefile.php');

function get_include_contents($filename) {
    if (is_file($filename)) {
