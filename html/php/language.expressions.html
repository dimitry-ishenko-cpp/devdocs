<div id="language.expressions" class="chapter"> <h1 class="title">Expressions</h1> <p class="simpara"> Expressions are the most important building blocks of PHP. In PHP, almost anything you write is an expression. The simplest yet most accurate way to define an expression is "anything that has a value". </p> <p class="simpara"> The most basic forms of expressions are constants and variables. When you type <code class="code">$a = 5</code>, you're assigning <code class="code">5</code> into <var class="varname">$a</var>. <code class="code">5</code>, obviously, has the value 5, or in other words <code class="code">5</code> is an expression with the value of 5 (in this case, <code class="code">5</code> is an integer constant). </p> <p class="simpara"> After this assignment, you'd expect <var class="varname">$a</var>'s value to be 5 as well, so if you wrote <code class="code">$b = $a</code>, you'd expect it to behave just as if you wrote <code class="code">$b = 5</code>. In other words, <var class="varname">$a</var> is an expression with the value of 5 as well. If everything works right, this is exactly what will happen. </p> <p class="para"> Slightly more complex examples for expressions are functions. For instance, consider the following function: </p>
<div class="informalexample"> <div class="example-contents"> <pre class="phpcode" data-language="php">&lt;?php
function foo ()
{
    return 5;
}
?&gt;</pre> </div> </div> <p class="simpara"> Assuming you're familiar with the concept of functions (if you're not, take a look at the chapter about <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.functions.php" class="link">functions</a>), you'd assume that typing <code class="code">$c = foo()</code> is essentially just like writing <code class="code">$c = 5</code>, and you're right. Functions are expressions with the value of their return value. Since <code class="code">foo()</code> returns 5, the value of the expression '<code class="code">foo()</code>' is 5. Usually functions don't just return a static value but compute something. </p> <p class="simpara"> Of course, values in PHP don't have to be integers, and very often they aren't. PHP supports four scalar value types: <span class="type"><a href="language.types.integer.html" class="type int">int</a></span> values, floating point values (<span class="type"><a href="language.types.float.html" class="type float">float</a></span>), <span class="type"><a href="language.types.string.html" class="type string">string</a></span> values and <span class="type"><a href="language.types.boolean.html" class="type bool">bool</a></span> values (scalar values are values that you can't 'break' into smaller pieces, unlike arrays, for instance). PHP also supports two composite (non-scalar) types: arrays and objects. Each of these value types can be assigned into variables or returned from functions. </p> <p class="simpara"> PHP takes expressions much further, in the same way many other languages do. PHP is an expression-oriented language, in the sense that almost everything is an expression. Consider the example we've already dealt with, <code class="code">$a = 5</code>. It's easy to see that there are two values involved here, the value of the integer constant <code class="code">5</code>, and the value of <var class="varname">$a</var> which is being updated to 5 as well. But the truth is that there's one additional value involved here, and that's the value of the assignment itself. The assignment itself evaluates to the assigned value, in this case 5. In practice, it means that <code class="code">$a = 5</code>, regardless of what it does, is an expression with the value 5. Thus, writing something like <code class="code">$b = ($a = 5)</code> is like writing <code class="code">$a = 5; $b = 5;</code> (a semicolon marks the end of a statement). Since assignments are parsed in a right to left order, you can also write <code class="code">$b = $a = 5</code>. </p> <p class="simpara"> Another good example of expression orientation is pre- and post-increment and decrement. Users of PHP and many other languages may be familiar with the notation of <code class="code">variable++</code> and <code class="code">variable--</code>. These are <a href="language.operators.increment.html" class="link"> increment and decrement operators</a>. In PHP, like in C, there are two types of increment - pre-increment and post-increment. Both pre-increment and post-increment essentially increment the variable, and the effect on the variable is identical. The difference is with the value of the increment expression. Pre-increment, which is written <code class="code">++$variable</code>, evaluates to the incremented value (PHP increments the variable before reading its value, thus the name 'pre-increment'). Post-increment, which is written <code class="code">$variable++</code> evaluates to the original value of <var class="varname">$variable</var>, before it was incremented (PHP increments the variable after reading its value, thus the name 'post-increment'). </p> <p class="simpara"> A very common type of expressions are <a href="language.operators.comparison.html" class="link">comparison</a> expressions. These expressions evaluate to either <strong><code><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php#constant.false">false</a></code></strong> or <strong><code><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php#constant.true">true</a></code></strong>. PHP supports &gt; (bigger than), &gt;= (bigger than or equal to), == (equal), != (not equal), &lt; (smaller than) and &lt;= (smaller than or equal to). The language also supports a set of strict equivalence operators: === (equal to and same type) and !== (not equal to or not same type). These expressions are most commonly used inside conditional execution, such as <code class="code">if</code> statements. </p> <p class="simpara"> The last example of expressions we'll deal with here is combined operator-assignment expressions. You already know that if you want to increment <var class="varname">$a</var> by 1, you can simply write <code class="code">$a++</code> or <code class="code">++$a</code>. But what if you want to add more than one to it, for instance 3? You could write <code class="code">$a++</code> multiple times, but this is obviously not a very efficient or comfortable way. A much more common practice is to write <code class="code">$a =
    $a + 3</code>. <code class="code">$a + 3</code> evaluates to the value of <var class="varname">$a</var> plus 3, and is assigned back into <var class="varname">$a</var>, which results in incrementing <var class="varname">$a</var> by 3. In PHP, as in several other languages like C, you can write this in a shorter way, which with time would become clearer and quicker to understand as well. Adding 3 to the current value of <var class="varname">$a</var> can be written <code class="code">$a += 3</code>. This means exactly "take the value of <var class="varname">$a</var>, add 3 to it, and assign it back into <var class="varname">$a</var>". In addition to being shorter and clearer, this also results in faster execution. The value of <code class="code">$a += 3</code>, like the value of a regular assignment, is the assigned value. Notice that it is NOT 3, but the combined value of <var class="varname">$a</var> plus 3 (this is the value that's assigned into <var class="varname">$a</var>). Any two-place operator can be used in this operator-assignment mode, for example <code class="code">$a -= 5</code> (subtract 5 from the value of <var class="varname">$a</var>), <code class="code">$b *= 7</code> (multiply the value of <var class="varname">$b</var> by 7), etc. </p> <p class="para"> There is one more expression that may seem odd if you haven't seen it in other languages, the ternary conditional operator: </p> 
<div class="informalexample"> <div class="example-contents"> <pre class="phpcode" data-language="php">&lt;?php
$first ? $second : $third
?&gt;</pre> </div> </div> <p class="para"> If the value of the first subexpression is <strong><code><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php#constant.true">true</a></code></strong> (non-zero), then the second subexpression is evaluated, and that is the result of the conditional expression. Otherwise, the third subexpression is evaluated, and that is the value. </p> <p class="para"> The following example should help you understand pre- and post-increment and expressions in general a bit better: </p> 
<div class="informalexample"> <div class="example-contents"> <pre class="phpcode" data-language="php">&lt;?php
function double($i)
{
    return $i*2;
}
$b = $a = 5;        /* assign the value five into the variable $a and $b */
$c = $a++;          /* post-increment, assign original value of $a 
                       (5) to $c */
$e = $d = ++$b;     /* pre-increment, assign the incremented value of 
                       $b (6) to $d and $e */

/* at this point, both $d and $e are equal to 6 */

$f = double($d++);  /* assign twice the value of $d before
                       the increment, 2*6 = 12 to $f */
$g = double(++$e);  /* assign twice the value of $e after
                       the increment, 2*7 = 14 to $g */
$h = $g += 10;      /* first, $g is incremented by 10 and ends with the 
                       value of 24. the value of the assignment (24) is 
                       then assigned into $h, and $h ends with the value 
                       of 24 as well. */
?&gt;</pre> </div> </div> <p class="simpara"> Some expressions can be considered as statements. In this case, a statement has the form of '<code class="code">expr ;</code>' that is, an expression followed by a semicolon. In <code class="code">$b = $a = 5;</code>, <code class="code">$a = 5</code> is a valid expression, but it's not a statement by itself. <code class="code">$b = $a = 5;</code>, however, is a valid statement. </p> <p class="simpara"> One last thing worth mentioning is the truth value of expressions. In many events, mainly in conditional execution and loops, you're not interested in the specific value of the expression, but only care about whether it means <strong><code><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php#constant.true">true</a></code></strong> or <strong><code><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php#constant.false">false</a></code></strong>. The constants <strong><code><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php#constant.true">true</a></code></strong> and <strong><code><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php#constant.false">false</a></code></strong> (case-insensitive) are the two possible boolean values. When necessary, an expression is automatically converted to boolean. See the <a href="language.types.type-juggling.html#language.types.typecasting" class="link">section about type-casting</a> for details about how. </p> <p class="simpara"> PHP provides a full and powerful implementation of expressions, and documenting it entirely goes beyond the scope of this manual. The above examples should give you a good idea about what expressions are and how you can construct useful expressions. Throughout the rest of this manual we'll write <var class="varname">expr</var> to indicate any valid PHP expression. </p> </div> </div>
