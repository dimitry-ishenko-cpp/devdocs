  <div id="layout"> <div id="layout-content"><div id="function.include-once" class="sect1"> <h2 class="title">include_once</h2> <p class="verinfo">(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)</p> <p class="para"> The <code class="literal">include_once</code> statement includes and evaluates the specified file during the execution of the script. This is a behavior similar to the <span class="function"><a href="function.include.html" class="function">include</a></span> statement, with the only difference being that if the code from a file has already been included, it will not be included again, and include_once returns <strong><code>true</code></strong>. As the name suggests, the file will be included just once. </p> <p class="para"> <code class="literal">include_once</code> may be used in cases where the same file might be included and evaluated more than once during a particular execution of a script, so in this case it may help avoid problems such as function redefinitions, variable value reassignments, etc. </p> <p class="para"> See the <span class="function"><a href="function.include.html" class="function">include</a></span> documentation for information about how this function works. </p> </div></div>
