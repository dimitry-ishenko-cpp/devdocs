<h1 id="label-Marshal+Format">
<a href="marshal.html"><code>Marshal</code></a> Format</h1> <p>The <a href="marshal.html"><code>Marshal</code></a> format is used to serialize ruby objects. The format can store arbitrary objects through three user-defined extension mechanisms.</p> <p>For documentation on using <a href="marshal.html"><code>Marshal</code></a> to serialize and deserialize objects, see the <a href="marshal.html"><code>Marshal</code></a> module.</p> <p>This document calls a serialized set of objects a stream. The Ruby implementation can load a set of objects from a <a href="string.html"><code>String</code></a>, an <a href="io.html"><code>IO</code></a> or an object that implements a <code>getc</code> method.</p> <h2 id="label-Stream+Format">Stream Format</h2> <p>The first two bytes of the stream contain the major and minor version, each as a single byte encoding a digit. The version implemented in Ruby is 4.8 (stored as “x04x08”) and is supported by ruby 1.8.0 and newer.</p> <p>Different major versions of the <a href="marshal.html"><code>Marshal</code></a> format are not compatible and cannot be understood by other major versions. Lesser minor versions of the format can be understood by newer minor versions. Format 4.7 can be loaded by a 4.8 implementation but format 4.8 cannot be loaded by a 4.7 implementation.</p> <p>Following the version bytes is a stream describing the serialized object. The stream contains nested objects (the same as a Ruby object) but objects in the stream do not necessarily have a direct mapping to the Ruby object model.</p> <p>Each object in the stream is described by a byte indicating its type followed by one or more bytes describing the object. When “object” is mentioned below it means any of the types below that defines a Ruby object.</p> <h3 id="label-true-2C+false-2C+nil">true, false, nil</h3> <p>These objects are each one byte long. “T” is represents <code>true</code>, “F” represents <code>false</code> and “0” represents <code>nil</code>.</p> <h3 id="label-Fixnum+and+long">Fixnum and long</h3> <p>“i” represents a signed 32 bit value using a packed format. One through five bytes follows the type. The value loaded will always be a Fixnum. On 32 bit platforms (where the precision of a Fixnum is less than 32 bits) loading large values will cause overflow on CRuby.</p> <p>The fixnum type is used to represent both ruby Fixnum objects and the sizes of marshaled arrays, hashes, instance variables and other types. In the following sections “long” will mean the format described below, which supports full 32 bit precision.</p> <p>The first byte has the following special values:</p> <dl class="rdoc-list note-list">
<dt>“x00” </dt>
<dd> <p>The value of the integer is 0. No bytes follow.</p> </dd>
<dt>“x01” </dt>
<dd> <p>The total size of the integer is two bytes. The following byte is a positive integer in the range of 0 through 255. Only values between 123 and 255 should be represented this way to save bytes.</p> </dd>
<dt>“xff” </dt>
<dd> <p>The total size of the integer is two bytes. The following byte is a negative integer in the range of -1 through -256.</p> </dd>
<dt>“x02” </dt>
<dd> <p>The total size of the integer is three bytes. The following two bytes are a positive little-endian integer.</p> </dd>
<dt>“xfe” </dt>
<dd> <p>The total size of the integer is three bytes. The following two bytes are a negative little-endian integer.</p> </dd>
<dt>“x03” </dt>
<dd> <p>The total size of the integer is four bytes. The following three bytes are a positive little-endian integer.</p> </dd>
<dt>“xfd” </dt>
<dd> <p>The total size of the integer is four bytes. The following three bytes are a negative little-endian integer.</p> </dd>
<dt>“x04” </dt>
<dd> <p>The total size of the integer is five bytes. The following four bytes are a positive little-endian integer. For compatibility with 32 bit ruby, only Fixnums less than 1073741824 should be represented this way. For sizes of stream objects full precision may be used.</p> </dd>
<dt>“xfc” </dt>
<dd> <p>The total size of the integer is five bytes. The following four bytes are a negative little-endian integer. For compatibility with 32 bit ruby, only Fixnums greater than -10737341824 should be represented this way. For sizes of stream objects full precision may be used.</p> </dd>
</dl> <p>Otherwise the first byte is a sign-extended eight-bit value with an offset. If the value is positive the value is determined by subtracting 5 from the value. If the value is negative the value is determined by adding 5 to the value.</p> <p>There are multiple representations for many values. CRuby always outputs the shortest representation possible.</p> <h3 id="label-Symbols+and+Byte+Sequence">Symbols and Byte Sequence</h3> <p>“:” represents a real symbol. A real symbol contains the data needed to define the symbol for the rest of the stream as future occurrences in the stream will instead be references (a symbol link) to this one. The reference is a zero-indexed 32 bit value (so the first occurrence of <code>:hello</code> is 0).</p> <p>Following the type byte is byte sequence which consists of a long indicating the number of bytes in the sequence followed by that many bytes of data. Byte sequences have no encoding.</p> <p>For example, the following stream contains the <a href="symbol.html"><code>Symbol</code></a> <code>:hello</code>:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">"\x04\x08:\x0ahello"
</pre> <p>“;” represents a <a href="symbol.html"><code>Symbol</code></a> link which references a previously defined <a href="symbol.html"><code>Symbol</code></a>. Following the type byte is a long containing the index in the lookup table for the linked (referenced) <a href="symbol.html"><code>Symbol</code></a>.</p> <p>For example, the following stream contains <code>[:hello, :hello]</code>:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">"\x04\b[\a:\nhello;\x00"
</pre> <p>When a “symbol” is referenced below it may be either a real symbol or a symbol link.</p> <h3 id="label-Object+References">
<a href="object.html"><code>Object</code></a> References</h3> <p>Separate from but similar to symbol references, the stream contains only one copy of each object (as determined by object_id) for all objects except true, false, nil, Fixnums and Symbols (which are stored separately as described above) a one-indexed 32 bit value will be stored and reused when the object is encountered again. (The first object has an index of 1).</p> <p>“@” represents an object link. Following the type byte is a long giving the index of the object.</p> <p>For example, the following stream contains an <a href="array.html"><code>Array</code></a> of the same <code>"hello"</code> object twice:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">"\004\b[\a\"\nhello@\006"
</pre> <h3 id="label-Instance+Variables">Instance Variables</h3> <p>“I” indicates that instance variables follow the next object. An object follows the type byte. Following the object is a length indicating the number of instance variables for the object. Following the length is a set of name-value pairs. The names are symbols while the values are objects. The symbols must be instance variable names (<code>:@name</code>).</p> <p>An <a href="object.html"><code>Object</code></a> (“o” type, described below) uses the same format for its instance variables as described here.</p> <p>For a <a href="string.html"><code>String</code></a> and <a href="regexp.html"><code>Regexp</code></a> (described below) a special instance variable <code>:E</code> is used to indicate the <a href="encoding.html"><code>Encoding</code></a>.</p> <h3 id="label-Extended">Extended</h3> <p>“e” indicates that the next object is extended by a module. An object follows the type byte. Following the object is a symbol that contains the name of the module the object is extended by.</p> <h3 id="label-Array"><a href="array.html"><code>Array</code></a></h3> <p>“[” represents an <a href="array.html"><code>Array</code></a>. Following the type byte is a long indicating the number of objects in the array. The given number of objects follow the length.</p> <h3 id="label-Bignum">Bignum</h3> <p>“l” represents a Bignum which is composed of three parts:</p> <dl class="rdoc-list note-list">
<dt>sign </dt>
<dd> <p>A single byte containing “+” for a positive value or “-” for a negative value.</p> </dd>
<dt>length </dt>
<dd> <p>A long indicating the number of bytes of Bignum data follows, divided by two. Multiply the length by two to determine the number of bytes of data that follow.</p> </dd>
<dt>data </dt>
<dd> <p>Bytes of Bignum data representing the number.</p> </dd>
</dl> <p>The following ruby code will reconstruct the Bignum value from an array of bytes:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">result = 0

bytes.each_with_index do |byte, exp|
 result += (byte * 2 ** (exp * 8))
end
</pre> <h3 id="label-Class+and+Module">
<a href="class.html"><code>Class</code></a> and <a href="module.html"><code>Module</code></a>
</h3> <p>“c” represents a <a href="class.html"><code>Class</code></a> object, “m” represents a <a href="module.html"><code>Module</code></a> and “M” represents either a class or module (this is an old-style for compatibility). No class or module content is included, this type is only a reference. Following the type byte is a byte sequence which is used to look up an existing class or module, respectively.</p> <p>Instance variables are not allowed on a class or module.</p> <p>If no class or module exists an exception should be raised.</p> <p>For “c” and “m” types, the loaded object must be a class or module, respectively.</p>  <p>“d” represents a <span><code>Data</code></span> object. (<span><code>Data</code></span> objects are wrapped pointers from ruby extensions.) Following the type byte is a symbol indicating the class for the <span><code>Data</code></span> object and an object that contains the state of the <span><code>Data</code></span> object.</p> <p>To dump a <span><code>Data</code></span> object Ruby calls _dump_data. To load a <span><code>Data</code></span> object Ruby calls _load_data with the state of the object on a newly allocated instance.</p> <h3 id="label-Float"><a href="float.html"><code>Float</code></a></h3> <p>“f” represents a <a href="float.html"><code>Float</code></a> object. Following the type byte is a byte sequence containing the float value. The following values are special:</p> <dl class="rdoc-list note-list">

<dd> <p>Positive infinity</p> </dd>
<dt>“-inf” </dt>
<dd> <p>Negative infinity</p> </dd>
<dt>“nan” </dt>
<dd> <p>Not a Number</p> </dd>
</dl> <p>Otherwise the byte sequence contains a C double (loadable by strtod(3)). Older minor versions of <a href="marshal.html"><code>Marshal</code></a> also stored extra mantissa bits to ensure portability across platforms but 4.8 does not include these. See</p> <dl class="rdoc-list label-list">
