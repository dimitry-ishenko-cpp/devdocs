 <p><em><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack">Corepack</a></em> is an experimental tool to help with managing versions of your package managers. It exposes binary proxies for each <a href="#supported-package-managers">supported package manager</a> that, when called, will identify whatever package manager is configured for the current project, transparently install it if needed, and finally run it without requiring explicit user interactions.</p> <p>This feature simplifies two core workflows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It eases new contributor onboarding, since they won't have to follow system-specific installation processes anymore just to have the package manager you want them to.</p> </li> <li> <p>It allows you to ensure that everyone in your team will use exactly the package manager version you intend them to, without them having to manually synchronize it each time you need to make an update.</p> </li> </ul> <section><h3 id="workflows">Workflows
</h3> <h4 id="enabling-the-feature">Enabling the feature
</h4> <p>Due to its experimental status, Corepack currently needs to be explicitly enabled to have any effect. To do that, run <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#corepack-enable--name"><code>corepack enable</code></a>, which will set up the symlinks in your environment next to the <code>node</code> binary (and overwrite the existing symlinks if necessary).</p> <p>From this point forward, any call to the <a href="#supported-package-managers">supported binaries</a> will work without further setup. Should you experience a problem, run <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#corepack-disable--name"><code>corepack disable</code></a> to remove the proxies from your system (and consider opening an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack">Corepack repository</a> to let us know).</p> <h4 id="configuring-a-package">Configuring a package
</h4> <p>The Corepack proxies will find the closest <a href="packages.html#nodejs-packagejson-field-definitions"><code>package.json</code></a> file in your current directory hierarchy to extract its <a href="packages.html#packagemanager"><code>"packageManager"</code></a> property.</p> <p>If the value corresponds to a <a href="#supported-package-managers">supported package manager</a>, Corepack will make sure that all calls to the relevant binaries are run against the requested version, downloading it on demand if needed, and aborting if it cannot be successfully retrieved.</p> <p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#corepack-use-nameversion"><code>corepack use</code></a> to ask Corepack to update your local <code>package.json</code> to use the package manager of your choice:</p> <pre data-language="js">corepack use pnpm@7.x # sets the latest 7.x version in the package.json
corepack use yarn@* # sets the latest version in the package.json copy</pre> <h4 id="upgrading-the-global-versions">Upgrading the global versions
</h4> <p>When running outside of an existing project (for example when running <code>yarn init</code>), Corepack will by default use predefined versions roughly corresponding to the latest stable releases from each tool. Those versions can be overridden by running the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#corepack-install--g--global---all--nameversion"><code>corepack install</code></a> command along with the package manager version you wish to set:</p> <pre data-language="js">corepack install --global yarn@x.y.z copy</pre> <p>Alternately, a tag or range may be used:</p> <pre data-language="js">corepack install --global pnpm@*
corepack install --global yarn@stable copy</pre> <h4 id="offline-workflow">Offline workflow
</h4> <p>Many production environments don't have network access. Since Corepack usually downloads the package manager releases straight from their registries, it can conflict with such environments. To avoid that happening, call the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#corepack-pack---all--nameversion"><code>corepack pack</code></a> command while you still have network access (typically at the same time you're preparing your deploy image). This will ensure that the required package managers are available even without network access.</p> <p>The <code>pack</code> command has <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#utility-commands">various flags</a>. Consult the detailed <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#readme">Corepack documentation</a> for more information.</p> </section><section><h3 id="supported-package-managers">Supported package managers

</h3> <h4 id="how-does-corepack-interact-with-npm">How does Corepack interact with npm?
</h4> <p>While Corepack could support npm like any other package manager, its shims aren't enabled by default. This has a few consequences:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It's always possible to run a <code>npm</code> command within a project configured to be used with another package manager, since Corepack cannot intercept it.</p> </li> <li> <p>While <code>npm</code> is a valid option in the <a href="packages.html#packagemanager"><code>"packageManager"</code></a> property, the lack of shim will cause the global npm to be used.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="running-npm-install--g-yarn-doesnt-work">Running <code>npm install -g yarn</code> doesn't work
</h4> <p>npm prevents accidentally overriding the Corepack binaries when doing a global install. To avoid this problem, consider one of the following options:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Don't run this command; Corepack will provide the package manager binaries anyway and will ensure that the requested versions are always available, so installing the package managers explicitly isn't needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the <code>--force</code> flag to <code>npm install</code>; this will tell npm that it's fine to override binaries, but you'll erase the Corepack ones in the process. (Run <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#corepack-enable--name"><code>corepack enable</code></a> to add them back.)</p> </li> </ul></section><div class="_attribution">
