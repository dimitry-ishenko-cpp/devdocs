<h1>6.4. Returning Data from Modified Rows </h1>    <p>Sometimes it is useful to obtain data from modified rows while they are being manipulated. The <code class="command">INSERT</code>, <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, <code class="command">DELETE</code>, and <code class="command">MERGE</code> commands all have an optional <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause that supports this. Use of <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> avoids performing an extra database query to collect the data, and is especially valuable when it would otherwise be difficult to identify the modified rows reliably.</p> <p>The allowed contents of a <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause are the same as a <code class="command">SELECT</code> command's output list (see <a class="xref" href="queries-select-lists.html" title="7.3. Select Lists">Section 7.3</a>). It can contain column names of the command's target table, or value expressions using those columns. A common shorthand is <code class="literal">RETURNING *</code>, which selects all columns of the target table in order.</p> <p>In an <code class="command">INSERT</code>, the data available to <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> is the row as it was inserted. This is not so useful in trivial inserts, since it would just repeat the data provided by the client. But it can be very handy when relying on computed default values. For example, when using a <a class="link" href="datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL" title="8.1.4. Serial Types"><code class="type">serial</code></a> column to provide unique identifiers, <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> can return the ID assigned to a new row:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE TABLE users (firstname text, lastname text, id serial primary key);

INSERT INTO users (firstname, lastname) VALUES ('Joe', 'Cool') RETURNING id;
</pre> <p>The <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause is also very useful with <code class="literal">INSERT ... SELECT</code>.</p> <p>In an <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, the data available to <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> is the new content of the modified row. For example:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.10
  WHERE price &lt;= 99.99
  RETURNING name, price AS new_price;
</pre> <p>In a <code class="command">DELETE</code>, the data available to <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> is the content of the deleted row. For example:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
DELETE FROM products
  WHERE obsoletion_date = 'today'
  RETURNING *;
</pre> <p>In a <code class="command">MERGE</code>, the data available to <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> is the content of the source row plus the content of the inserted, updated, or deleted target row. Since it is quite common for the source and target to have many of the same columns, specifying <code class="literal">RETURNING *</code> can lead to a lot of duplicated columns, so it is often more useful to qualify it so as to return just the source or target row. For example:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
MERGE INTO products p USING new_products n ON p.product_no = n.product_no
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (n.product_no, n.name, n.price)
  WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET name = n.name, price = n.price
  RETURNING p.*;
</pre> <p>If there are triggers (<a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/triggers.html" title="Chapter 37. Triggers">Chapter 37</a>) on the target table, the data available to <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> is the row as modified by the triggers. Thus, inspecting columns computed by triggers is another common use-case for <code class="literal">RETURNING</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
