For each candidate change row, the status of <code class="literal">MATCHED</code>, <code class="literal">NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE</code>, or <code class="literal">NOT MATCHED [BY TARGET]</code> is set just once, after which <code class="literal">WHEN</code> clauses are evaluated in the order specified. For each candidate change row, the first clause to evaluate as true is executed. No more than one <code class="literal">WHEN</code> clause is executed for any candidate change row.</p> <p><code class="command">MERGE</code> actions have the same effect as regular <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, <code class="command">INSERT</code>, or <code class="command">DELETE</code> commands of the same names. The syntax of those commands is different, notably that there is no <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause and no table name is specified. All actions refer to the target table, though modifications to other tables may be made using triggers.</p> <p>When <code class="literal">DO NOTHING</code> is specified, the source row is skipped. Since actions are evaluated in their specified order, <code class="literal">DO NOTHING</code> can be handy to skip non-interesting source rows before more fine-grained handling.</p> <p>The optional <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause causes <code class="command">MERGE</code> to compute and return value(s) based on each row inserted, updated, or deleted. Any expression using the source or target table's columns, or the <a class="link" href="functions-merge-support.html#MERGE-ACTION"><code class="function">merge_action()</code></a> function can be computed. When an <code class="command">INSERT</code> or <code class="command">UPDATE</code> action is performed, the new values of the target table's columns are used. When a <code class="command">DELETE</code> is performed, the old values of the target table's columns are used. The syntax of the <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> list is identical to that of the output list of <code class="command">SELECT</code>.</p> <p>There is no separate <code class="literal">MERGE</code> privilege. If you specify an update action, you must have the <code class="literal">UPDATE</code> privilege on the column(s) of the target table that are referred to in the <code class="literal">SET</code> clause. If you specify an insert action, you must have the <code class="literal">INSERT</code> privilege on the target table. If you specify a delete action, you must have the <code class="literal">DELETE</code> privilege on the target table. If you specify a <code class="literal">DO NOTHING</code> action, you must have the <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege on at least one column of the target table. You will also need <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege on any column(s) of the <code>data_source</code> and of the target table referred to in any <code class="literal">condition</code> (including <code class="literal">join_condition</code>) or <code class="literal">expression</code>. Privileges are tested once at statement start and are checked whether or not particular <code class="literal">WHEN</code> clauses are executed.</p> <p><code class="command">MERGE</code> is not supported if the target table is a materialized view, foreign table, or if it has any rules defined on it.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.156.6"> <h2>Parameters</h2> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code>with_query</code></dt> <dd> <p>The <code class="literal">WITH</code> clause allows you to specify one or more subqueries that can be referenced by name in the <code class="command">MERGE</code> query.

</pre> <p>The <code>total_count</code> is the total number of rows changed (whether inserted, updated, or deleted). If <code>total_count</code> is 0, no rows were changed in any way.</p> <p>If the <code class="command">MERGE</code> command contains a <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause, the result will be similar to that of a <code class="command">SELECT</code> statement containing the columns and values defined in the <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> list, computed over the row(s) inserted, updated, or deleted by the command.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.156.8"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>The following steps take place during the execution of <code class="command">MERGE</code>.</p> <div class="orderedlist"> <ol class="orderedlist" type="1"> <li> <p>Perform any <code class="literal">BEFORE STATEMENT</code> triggers for all actions specified, whether or not their <code class="literal">WHEN</code> clauses match.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perform a join from source to target table. The resulting query will be optimized normally and will produce a set of candidate change rows. For each candidate change row,</p> <div class="orderedlist"> <ol class="orderedlist" type="a"> <li> <p>Evaluate whether each row is <code class="literal">MATCHED</code>, <code class="literal">NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE</code>, or <code class="literal">NOT MATCHED [BY TARGET]</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test each <code class="literal">WHEN</code> condition in the order specified until one returns true.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a condition returns true, perform the following actions:</p> <div class="orderedlist"> <ol class="orderedlist" type="i"> <li> <p>Perform any <code class="literal">BEFORE ROW</code> triggers that fire for the action's event type.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perform the specified action, invoking any check constraints on the target table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perform any <code class="literal">AFTER ROW</code> triggers that fire for the action's event type.</p> </li> </ol> </div> <p>If the target relation is a view with <code class="literal">INSTEAD OF ROW</code> triggers for the action's event type, they are used to perform the action instead.</p> </li> </ol> </div> </li> <li> <p>Perform any <code class="literal">AFTER STATEMENT</code> triggers for actions specified, whether or not they actually occur. This is similar to the behavior of an <code class="command">UPDATE</code> statement that modifies no rows.</p> </li> </ol> </div> <p>In summary, statement triggers for an event type (say, <code class="command">INSERT</code>) will be fired whenever we <span class="emphasis"><em>specify</em></span> an action of that kind. In contrast, row-level triggers will fire only for the specific event type being <span class="emphasis"><em>executed</em></span>. So a <code class="command">MERGE</code> command might fire statement triggers for both <code class="command">UPDATE</code> and <code class="command">INSERT</code>, even though only <code class="command">UPDATE</code> row triggers were fired.</p> <p>You should ensure that the join produces at most one candidate change row for each target row. In other words, a target row shouldn't join to more than one data source row. If it does, then only one of the candidate change rows will be used to modify the target row; later attempts to modify the row will cause an error. This can also occur if row triggers make changes to the target table and the rows so modified are then subsequently also modified by <code class="command">MERGE</code>. If the repeated action is an <code class="command">INSERT</code>, this will cause a uniqueness violation, while a repeated <code class="command">UPDATE</code> or <code class="command">DELETE</code> will cause a cardinality violation; the latter behavior is required by the SQL standard. This differs from historical PostgreSQL behavior of joins in <code class="command">UPDATE</code> and <code class="command">DELETE</code> statements where second and subsequent attempts to modify the same row are simply ignored.</p> <p>If a <code class="literal">WHEN</code> clause omits an <code class="literal">AND</code> sub-clause, it becomes the final reachable clause of that kind (<code class="literal">MATCHED</code>, <code class="literal">NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE</code>, or <code class="literal">NOT MATCHED [BY TARGET]</code>). If a later <code class="literal">WHEN</code> clause of that kind is specified it would be provably unreachable and an error is raised. If no final reachable clause is specified of either kind, it is possible that no action will be taken for a candidate change row.</p> <p>The order in which rows are generated from the data source is indeterminate by default. A <code>source_query</code> can be used to specify a consistent ordering, if required, which might be needed to avoid deadlocks between concurrent transactions.</p> <p>When <code class="command">MERGE</code> is run concurrently with other commands that modify the target table, the usual transaction isolation rules apply; see <a class="xref" href="transaction-iso.html" title="13.2. Transaction Isolation">Section 13.2</a> for an explanation on the behavior at each isolation level. You may also wish to consider using <code class="command">INSERT ... ON CONFLICT</code> as an alternative statement which offers the ability to run an <code class="command">UPDATE</code> if a concurrent <code class="command">INSERT</code> occurs.
