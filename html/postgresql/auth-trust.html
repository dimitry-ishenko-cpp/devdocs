<h1>20.4. Trust Authentication </h1>    <p>When <code class="literal">trust</code> authentication is specified, PostgreSQL assumes that anyone who can connect to the server is authorized to access the database with whatever database user name they specify (even superuser names). Of course, restrictions made in the <code class="literal">database</code> and <code class="literal">user</code> columns still apply. This method should only be used when there is adequate operating-system-level protection on connections to the server.</p> <p><code class="literal">trust</code> authentication is appropriate and very convenient for local connections on a single-user workstation. It is usually <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> appropriate by itself on a multiuser machine. However, you might be able to use <code class="literal">trust</code> even on a multiuser machine, if you restrict access to the server's Unix-domain socket file using file-system permissions. To do this, set the <code class="varname">unix_socket_permissions</code> (and possibly <code class="varname">unix_socket_group</code>) configuration parameters as described in <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/runtime-config-connection.html" title="19.3.Â Connections and Authentication">Section 19.3</a>. Or you could set the <code class="varname">unix_socket_directories</code> configuration parameter to place the socket file in a suitably restricted directory.</p> <p>Setting file-system permissions only helps for Unix-socket connections. Local TCP/IP connections are not restricted by file-system permissions. Therefore, if you want to use file-system permissions for local security, remove the <code class="literal">host ... 127.0.0.1 ...</code> line from <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code>, or change it to a non-<code class="literal">trust</code> authentication method.</p> <p><code class="literal">trust</code> authentication is only suitable for TCP/IP connections if you trust every user on every machine that is allowed to connect to the server by the <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> lines that specify <code class="literal">trust</code>. It is seldom reasonable to use <code class="literal">trust</code> for any TCP/IP connections other than those from <span class="systemitem">localhost</span> (127.0.0.1).</p><div class="_attribution">
