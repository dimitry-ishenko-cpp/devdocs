</pre>  <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.79.5"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code class="command">CREATE RULE</code> defines a new rule applying to a specified table or view. <code class="command">CREATE OR REPLACE RULE</code> will either create a new rule, or replace an existing rule of the same name for the same table.</p> <p>The PostgreSQL rule system allows one to define an alternative action to be performed on insertions, updates, or deletions in database tables. Roughly speaking, a rule causes additional commands to be executed when a given command on a given table is executed. Alternatively, an <code class="literal">INSTEAD</code> rule can replace a given command by another, or cause a command not to be executed at all. Rules are used to implement SQL views as well. It is important to realize that a rule is really a command transformation mechanism, or command macro. The transformation happens before the execution of the command starts. If you actually want an operation that fires independently for each physical row, you probably want to use a trigger, not a rule. More information about the rules system is in <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/rules.html" title="Chapter 39. The Rule System">Chapter 39</a>.</p> <p>Presently, <code class="literal">ON SELECT</code> rules can only be attached to views. Such a rule must be named <code class="literal">"_RETURN"</code>, must be an unconditional <code class="literal">INSTEAD</code> rule, and must have an action that consists of a single <code class="command">SELECT</code> command. This command defines the visible contents of the view. (The view itself is basically a dummy table with no storage.) It's best to regard such a rule as an implementation detail. While a view can be redefined via <code class="literal">CREATE OR REPLACE RULE "_RETURN" AS ...</code>, it's better style to use <code class="literal">CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW</code>.</p> <p>You can create the illusion of an updatable view by defining <code class="literal">ON INSERT</code>, <code class="literal">ON UPDATE</code>, and <code class="literal">ON DELETE</code> rules (or any subset of those that's sufficient for your purposes) to replace update actions on the view with appropriate updates on other tables. If you want to support <code class="command">INSERT RETURNING</code> and so on, then be sure to put a suitable <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause into each of these rules.</p> <p>There is a catch if you try to use conditional rules for complex view updates: there <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be an unconditional <code class="literal">INSTEAD</code> rule for each action you wish to allow on the view. If the rule is conditional, or is not <code class="literal">INSTEAD</code>, then the system will still reject attempts to perform the update action, because it thinks it might end up trying to perform the action on the dummy table of the view in some cases. If you want to handle all the useful cases in conditional rules, add an unconditional <code class="literal">DO INSTEAD NOTHING</code> rule to ensure that the system understands it will never be called on to update the dummy table. Then make the conditional rules non-<code class="literal">INSTEAD</code>; in the cases where they are applied, they add to the default <code class="literal">INSTEAD NOTHING</code> action. (This method does not currently work to support <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> queries, however.)</p> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>A view that is simple enough to be automatically updatable (see <a class="xref" href="sql-createview.html" title="CREATE VIEW">CREATE VIEW</a>) does not require a user-created rule in order to be updatable. While you can create an explicit rule anyway, the automatic update transformation will generally outperform an explicit rule.</p> <p>Another alternative worth considering is to use <code class="literal">INSTEAD OF</code> triggers (see <a class="xref" href="sql-createtrigger.html" title="CREATE TRIGGER">CREATE TRIGGER</a>) in place of rules.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.79.6"> <h2>Parameters</h2> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code>name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name of a rule to create.

This clause will be used to compute the outputs if the rule is triggered by an <code class="command">INSERT RETURNING</code>, <code class="command">UPDATE RETURNING</code>, or <code class="command">DELETE RETURNING</code> command respectively. When the rule is triggered by a command without <code class="literal">RETURNING</code>, the rule's <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause will be ignored. The current implementation allows only unconditional <code class="literal">INSTEAD</code> rules to contain <code class="literal">RETURNING</code>; furthermore there can be at most one <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause among all the rules for the same event. (This ensures that there is only one candidate <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause to be used to compute the results.) <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> queries on the view will be rejected if there is no <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause in any available rule.</p> <p>It is very important to take care to avoid circular rules. For example, though each of the following two rule definitions are accepted by PostgreSQL, the <code class="command">SELECT</code> command would cause PostgreSQL to report an error because of recursive expansion of a rule:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE RULE "_RETURN" AS
    ON SELECT TO t1
    DO INSTEAD
        SELECT * FROM t2;

CREATE RULE "_RETURN" AS
    ON SELECT TO t2
    DO INSTEAD
        SELECT * FROM t1;

SELECT * FROM t1;
</pre> <p>Presently, if a rule action contains a <code class="command">NOTIFY</code> command, the <code class="command">NOTIFY</code> command will be executed unconditionally, that is, the <code class="command">NOTIFY</code> will be issued even if there are not any rows that the rule should apply to. For example, in:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE RULE notify_me AS ON UPDATE TO mytable DO ALSO NOTIFY mytable;

UPDATE mytable SET name = 'foo' WHERE id = 42;
</pre> <p>one <code class="command">NOTIFY</code> event will be sent during the <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, whether or not there are any rows that match the condition <code class="literal">id = 42</code>. This is an implementation restriction that might be fixed in future releases.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.79.8"> <h2>Compatibility</h2> <p><code class="command">CREATE RULE</code> is a PostgreSQL language extension, as is the entire query rewrite system.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.79.9"> <h2>See Also</h2>
