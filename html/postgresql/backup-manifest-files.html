<h1>69.2. Backup Manifest File Object </h1>    <p>The object which describes a single file contains either a <code class="literal">Path</code> key or an <code class="literal">Encoded-Path</code> key. Normally, the <code class="literal">Path</code> key will be present. The associated string value is the path of the file relative to the root of the backup directory. Files located in a user-defined tablespace will have paths whose first two components are <code class="filename">pg_tblspc</code> and the OID of the tablespace. If the path is not a string that is legal in UTF-8, or if the user requests that encoded paths be used for all files, then the <code class="literal">Encoded-Path</code> key will be present instead. This stores the same data, but it is encoded as a string of hexadecimal digits. Each pair of hexadecimal digits in the string represents a single octet.</p> <p>The following two keys are always present:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code class="literal">Size</code></dt> <dd> <p>The expected size of this file, as an integer.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">Last-Modified</code></dt> <dd> <p>The last modification time of the file as reported by the server at the time of the backup. Unlike the other fields stored in the backup, this field is not used by <a class="xref" href="app-pgverifybackup.html" title="pg_verifybackup">pg_verifybackup</a>. It is included only for informational purposes.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>If the backup was taken with file checksums enabled, the following keys will be present:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code class="literal">Checksum-Algorithm</code></dt> <dd> <p>The checksum algorithm used to compute a checksum for this file. Currently, this will be the same for every file in the backup manifest, but this may change in future releases. At present, the supported checksum algorithms are <code class="literal">CRC32C</code>, <code class="literal">SHA224</code>, <code class="literal">SHA256</code>, <code class="literal">SHA384</code>, and <code class="literal">SHA512</code>.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">Checksum</code></dt> <dd> <p>The checksum computed for this file, stored as a series of hexadecimal characters, two for each byte of the checksum.</p> </dd> </dl> </div><div class="_attribution">
