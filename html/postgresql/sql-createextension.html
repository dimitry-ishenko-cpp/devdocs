<h1>CREATE EXTENSION</h1> <p>CREATE EXTENSION — install an extension</p>   <h2>Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE EXTENSION [ IF NOT EXISTS ] extension_name
    [ WITH ] [ SCHEMA schema_name ]
             [ VERSION version ]
             [ CASCADE ]
</pre>  <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.64.5"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code class="command">CREATE EXTENSION</code> loads a new extension into the current database. There must not be an extension of the same name already loaded.</p> <p>Loading an extension essentially amounts to running the extension's script file. The script will typically create new SQL objects such as functions, data types, operators and index support methods. <code class="command">CREATE EXTENSION</code> additionally records the identities of all the created objects, so that they can be dropped again if <code class="command">DROP EXTENSION</code> is issued.</p> <p>The user who runs <code class="command">CREATE EXTENSION</code> becomes the owner of the extension for purposes of later privilege checks, and normally also becomes the owner of any objects created by the extension's script.</p> <p>Loading an extension ordinarily requires the same privileges that would be required to create its component objects. For many extensions this means superuser privileges are needed. However, if the extension is marked <em class="firstterm">trusted</em> in its control file, then it can be installed by any user who has <code class="literal">CREATE</code> privilege on the current database. In this case the extension object itself will be owned by the calling user, but the contained objects will be owned by the bootstrap superuser (unless the extension's script explicitly assigns them to the calling user). This configuration gives the calling user the right to drop the extension, but not to modify individual objects within it.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.64.6"> <h2>Parameters</h2> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code class="literal">IF NOT EXISTS</code></dt> <dd> <p>Do not throw an error if an extension with the same name already exists. A notice is issued in this case. Note that there is no guarantee that the existing extension is anything like the one that would have been created from the currently-available script file.</p> </dd> <dt><code>extension_name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name of the extension to be installed. PostgreSQL will create the extension using details from the file <code class="literal">SHAREDIR/extension/</code><code>extension_name</code><code class="literal">.control</code>.</p> </dd> <dt><code>schema_name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name of the schema in which to install the extension's objects, given that the extension allows its contents to be relocated. The named schema must already exist. If not specified, and the extension's control file does not specify a schema either, the current default object creation schema is used.</p> <p>If the extension specifies a <code class="literal">schema</code> parameter in its control file, then that schema cannot be overridden with a <code class="literal">SCHEMA</code> clause. Normally, an error will be raised if a <code class="literal">SCHEMA</code> clause is given and it conflicts with the extension's <code class="literal">schema</code> parameter. However, if the <code class="literal">CASCADE</code> clause is also given, then <code>schema_name</code> is ignored when it conflicts. The given <code>schema_name</code> will be used for installation of any needed extensions that do not specify <code class="literal">schema</code> in their control files.</p> <p>Remember that the extension itself is not considered to be within any schema: extensions have unqualified names that must be unique database-wide. But objects belonging to the extension can be within schemas.</p> </dd> <dt><code>version</code></dt> <dd> <p>The version of the extension to install. This can be written as either an identifier or a string literal. The default version is whatever is specified in the extension's control file.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">CASCADE</code></dt> <dd> <p>Automatically install any extensions that this extension depends on that are not already installed. Their dependencies are likewise automatically installed, recursively. The <code class="literal">SCHEMA</code> clause, if given, applies to all extensions that get installed this way. Other options of the statement are not applied to automatically-installed extensions; in particular, their default versions are always selected.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.64.7"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>Before you can use <code class="command">CREATE EXTENSION</code> to load an extension into a database, the extension's supporting files must be installed. Information about installing the extensions supplied with PostgreSQL can be found in <a class="link" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/contrib.html" title="Appendix F. Additional Supplied Modules and Extensions">Additional Supplied Modules</a>.</p> <p>The extensions currently available for loading can be identified from the <a class="link" href="view-pg-available-extensions.html" title="52.2. pg_available_extensions"><code class="structname">pg_available_extensions</code></a> or <a class="link" href="view-pg-available-extension-versions.html" title="52.3. pg_available_extension_versions"><code class="structname">pg_available_extension_versions</code></a> system views.</p> <blockquote class="caution"> <h3 class="title">Caution</h3> <p>Installing an extension as superuser requires trusting that the extension's author wrote the extension installation script in a secure fashion. It is not terribly difficult for a malicious user to create trojan-horse objects that will compromise later execution of a carelessly-written extension script, allowing that user to acquire superuser privileges. However, trojan-horse objects are only hazardous if they are in the <code class="varname">search_path</code> during script execution, meaning that they are in the extension's installation target schema or in the schema of some extension it depends on. Therefore, a good rule of thumb when dealing with extensions whose scripts have not been carefully vetted is to install them only into schemas for which CREATE privilege has not been and will not be granted to any untrusted users. Likewise for any extensions they depend on.</p> <p>The extensions supplied with PostgreSQL are believed to be secure against installation-time attacks of this sort, except for a few that depend on other extensions. As stated in the documentation for those extensions, they should be installed into secure schemas, or installed into the same schemas as the extensions they depend on, or both.</p> </blockquote> <p>For information about writing new extensions, see <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/extend-extensions.html" title="36.17. Packaging Related Objects into an Extension">Section 36.17</a>.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.64.8"> <h2>Examples</h2> <p>Install the <a class="link" href="hstore.html" title="F.17. hstore — hstore key/value datatype">hstore</a> extension into the current database, placing its objects in schema <code class="literal">addons</code>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
