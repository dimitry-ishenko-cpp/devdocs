<h1>REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW</h1> <p>REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW â€” replace the contents of a materialized view</p>   <h2>Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="sql">
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW [ CONCURRENTLY ] name
    [ WITH [ NO ] DATA ]
</pre>  <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.162.5"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code class="command">REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW</code> completely replaces the contents of a materialized view. To execute this command you must have the <code class="literal">MAINTAIN</code> privilege on the materialized view. The old contents are discarded. If <code class="literal">WITH DATA</code> is specified (or defaults) the backing query is executed to provide the new data, and the materialized view is left in a scannable state. If <code class="literal">WITH NO DATA</code> is specified no new data is generated and the materialized view is left in an unscannable state.</p> <p><code class="literal">CONCURRENTLY</code> and <code class="literal">WITH NO DATA</code> may not be specified together.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.162.6"> <h2>Parameters</h2> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code class="literal">CONCURRENTLY</code></dt> <dd> <p>Refresh the materialized view without locking out concurrent selects on the materialized view. Without this option a refresh which affects a lot of rows will tend to use fewer resources and complete more quickly, but could block other connections which are trying to read from the materialized view. This option may be faster in cases where a small number of rows are affected.</p> <p>This option is only allowed if there is at least one <code class="literal">UNIQUE</code> index on the materialized view which uses only column names and includes all rows; that is, it must not be an expression index or include a <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause.</p> <p>This option can only be used when the materialized view is already populated.</p> <p>Even with this option only one <code class="literal">REFRESH</code> at a time may run against any one materialized view.</p> </dd> <dt><code>name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the materialized view to refresh.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.162.7"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>If there is an <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code> clause in the materialized view's defining query, the original contents of the materialized view will be ordered that way; but <code class="command">REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW</code> does not guarantee to preserve that ordering.</p> <p>While <code class="command">REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW</code> is running, the <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-SEARCH-PATH">search_path</a> is temporarily changed to <code class="literal">pg_catalog, pg_temp</code>.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.162.8"> <h2>Examples</h2> <p>This command will replace the contents of the materialized view called <code class="literal">order_summary</code> using the query from the materialized view's definition, and leave it in a scannable state:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW order_summary;
</pre> <p>This command will free storage associated with the materialized view <code class="literal">annual_statistics_basis</code> and leave it in an unscannable state:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW annual_statistics_basis WITH NO DATA;
</pre> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.162.9"> <h2>Compatibility</h2> <p><code class="command">REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW</code> is a PostgreSQL extension.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.162.10"> <h2>See Also</h2>
