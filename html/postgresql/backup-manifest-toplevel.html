<h1>77.1. Backup Manifest Top-level Object </h1>    <p>The backup manifest JSON document contains the following keys.</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code class="literal">PostgreSQL-Backup-Manifest-Version</code></dt> <dd> <p>The associated value is always the integer 1.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">Files</code></dt> <dd> <p>The associated value is always a list of objects, each describing one file that is present in the backup. No entries are present in this list for the WAL files that are needed in order to use the backup, or for the backup manifest itself. The structure of each object in the list is described in <a class="xref" href="backup-manifest-files.html" title="77.2. Backup Manifest File Object">Section 77.2</a>.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">WAL-Ranges</code></dt> <dd> <p>The associated value is always a list of objects, each describing a range of WAL records that must be readable from a particular timeline in order to make use of the backup. The structure of these objects is further described in <a class="xref" href="backup-manifest-wal-ranges.html" title="77.3. Backup Manifest WAL Range Object">Section 77.3</a>.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">Manifest-Checksum</code></dt> <dd> <p>This key is always present on the last line of the backup manifest file. The associated value is a SHA256 checksum of all the preceding lines. We use a fixed checksum method here to make it possible for clients to do incremental parsing of the manifest. While a SHA256 checksum is significantly more expensive than a CRC32C checksum, the manifest should normally be small enough that the extra computation won't matter very much.</p> </dd> </dl> </div><div class="_attribution">
