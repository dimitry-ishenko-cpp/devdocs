<h1>18.1. The PostgreSQL User Account </h1>    <p>As with any server daemon that is accessible to the outside world, it is advisable to run PostgreSQL under a separate user account. This user account should only own the data that is managed by the server, and should not be shared with other daemons. (For example, using the user <code class="literal">nobody</code> is a bad idea.) In particular, it is advisable that this user account not own the PostgreSQL executable files, to ensure that a compromised server process could not modify those executables.</p> <p>Pre-packaged versions of PostgreSQL will typically create a suitable user account automatically during package installation.</p> <p>To add a Unix user account to your system, look for a command <code class="command">useradd</code> or <code class="command">adduser</code>. The user name <span class="systemitem">postgres</span> is often used, and is assumed throughout this book, but you can use another name if you like.</p><div class="_attribution">
