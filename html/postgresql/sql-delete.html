</pre>  <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.100.5"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code class="command">DELETE</code> deletes rows that satisfy the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause from the specified table. If the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause is absent, the effect is to delete all rows in the table. The result is a valid, but empty table.</p> <blockquote class="tip"> <h3 class="title">Tip</h3> <p><a class="link" href="sql-truncate.html" title="TRUNCATE"><code class="command">TRUNCATE</code></a> provides a faster mechanism to remove all rows from a table.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are two ways to delete rows in a table using information contained in other tables in the database: using sub-selects, or specifying additional tables in the <code class="literal">USING</code> clause. Which technique is more appropriate depends on the specific circumstances.</p> <p>The optional <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause causes <code class="command">DELETE</code> to compute and return value(s) based on each row actually deleted. Any expression using the table's columns, and/or columns of other tables mentioned in <code class="literal">USING</code>, can be computed. The syntax of the <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> list is identical to that of the output list of <code class="command">SELECT</code>.</p> <p>You must have the <code class="literal">DELETE</code> privilege on the table to delete from it, as well as the <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege for any table in the <code class="literal">USING</code> clause or whose values are read in the <code>condition</code>.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.100.6"> <h2>Parameters</h2> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code>with_query</code></dt> <dd> <p>The <code class="literal">WITH</code> clause allows you to specify one or more subqueries that can be referenced by name in the <code class="command">DELETE</code> query. See <a class="xref" href="queries-with.html" title="7.8. WITH Queries (Common Table Expressions)">Section 7.8</a> and <a class="xref" href="sql-select.html" title="SELECT">SELECT</a> for details.</p> </dd> <dt><code>table_name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to delete rows from. If <code class="literal">ONLY</code> is specified before the table name, matching rows are deleted from the named table only. If <code class="literal">ONLY</code> is not specified, matching rows are also deleted from any tables inheriting from the named table. Optionally, <code class="literal">*</code> can be specified after the table name to explicitly indicate that descendant tables are included.</p> </dd> <dt><code>alias</code></dt> <dd> <p>A substitute name for the target table. When an alias is provided, it completely hides the actual name of the table. For example, given <code class="literal">DELETE FROM foo AS f</code>, the remainder of the <code class="command">DELETE</code> statement must refer to this table as <code class="literal">f</code> not <code class="literal">foo</code>.</p> </dd> <dt><code>from_item</code></dt> <dd> <p>A table expression allowing columns from other tables to appear in the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition. This uses the same syntax as the <a class="link" href="sql-select.html#SQL-FROM" title="FROM Clause"><code class="literal">FROM</code></a> clause of a <code class="command">SELECT</code> statement; for example, an alias for the table name can be specified. Do not repeat the target table as a <code>from_item</code> unless you wish to set up a self-join (in which case it must appear with an alias in the <code>from_item</code>).</p> </dd> <dt><code>condition</code></dt> <dd> <p>An expression that returns a value of type <code class="type">boolean</code>. Only rows for which this expression returns <code class="literal">true</code> will be deleted.</p> </dd> <dt><code>cursor_name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name of the cursor to use in a <code class="literal">WHERE CURRENT OF</code> condition. The row to be deleted is the one most recently fetched from this cursor. The cursor must be a non-grouping query on the <code class="command">DELETE</code>'s target table. Note that <code class="literal">WHERE CURRENT OF</code> cannot be specified together with a Boolean condition. See <a class="xref" href="sql-declare.html" title="DECLARE">DECLARE</a> for more information about using cursors with <code class="literal">WHERE CURRENT OF</code>.</p> </dd> <dt><code>output_expression</code></dt> <dd> <p>An expression to be computed and returned by the <code class="command">DELETE</code> command after each row is deleted. The expression can use any column names of the table named by <code>table_name</code> or table(s) listed in <code class="literal">USING</code>. Write <code class="literal">*</code> to return all columns.</p> </dd> <dt><code>output_name</code></dt> <dd> <p>A name to use for a returned column.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.100.7"> <h2>Outputs</h2> <p>On successful completion, a <code class="command">DELETE</code> command returns a command tag of the form</p> <pre>
DELETE count
</pre> <p>The <code>count</code> is the number of rows deleted. Note that the number may be less than the number of rows that matched the <code>condition</code> when deletes were suppressed by a <code class="literal">BEFORE DELETE</code> trigger. If <code>count</code> is 0, no rows were deleted by the query (this is not considered an error).</p> <p>If the <code class="command">DELETE</code> command contains a <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clause, the result will be similar to that of a <code class="command">SELECT</code> statement containing the columns and values defined in the <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> list, computed over the row(s) deleted by the command.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.100.8"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>PostgreSQL lets you reference columns of other tables in the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition by specifying the other tables in the <code class="literal">USING</code> clause. For example, to delete all films produced by a given producer, one can do:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
DELETE FROM films USING producers
  WHERE producer_id = producers.id AND producers.name = 'foo';
</pre> <p>What is essentially happening here is a join between <code class="structname">films</code> and <code class="structname">producers</code>, with all successfully joined <code class="structname">films</code> rows being marked for deletion. This syntax is not standard. A more standard way to do it is:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
DELETE FROM films
  WHERE producer_id IN (SELECT id FROM producers WHERE name = 'foo');
</pre> <p>In some cases the join style is easier to write or faster to execute than the sub-select style.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.100.9"> <h2>Examples</h2> <p>Delete all films but musicals:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
DELETE FROM films WHERE kind &lt;&gt; 'Musical';
</pre> <p>Clear the table <code class="literal">films</code>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
DELETE FROM films;
</pre> <p>Delete completed tasks, returning full details of the deleted rows:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
DELETE FROM tasks WHERE status = 'DONE' RETURNING *;
</pre> <p>Delete the row of <code class="structname">tasks</code> on which the cursor <code class="literal">c_tasks</code> is currently positioned:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
DELETE FROM tasks WHERE CURRENT OF c_tasks;
</pre> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.100.10"> <h2>Compatibility</h2> <p>This command conforms to the SQL standard, except that the <code class="literal">USING</code> and <code class="literal">RETURNING</code> clauses are PostgreSQL extensions, as is the ability to use <code class="literal">WITH</code> with <code class="command">DELETE</code>.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.100.11"> <h2>See Also</h2>
