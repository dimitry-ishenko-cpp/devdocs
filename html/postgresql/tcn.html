<h1>F.42. tcn — a trigger function to notify listeners of changes to table content </h1>    <p>The <code class="filename">tcn</code> module provides a trigger function that notifies listeners of changes to any table on which it is attached. It must be used as an <code class="literal">AFTER</code> trigger <code class="literal">FOR EACH ROW</code>.</p> <p>This module is considered <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">trusted</span>”</span>, that is, it can be installed by non-superusers who have <code class="literal">CREATE</code> privilege on the current database.</p> <p>Only one parameter may be supplied to the function in a <code class="literal">CREATE TRIGGER</code> statement, and that is optional. If supplied it will be used for the channel name for the notifications. If omitted <code class="literal">tcn</code> will be used for the channel name.</p> <p>The payload of the notifications consists of the table name, a letter to indicate which type of operation was performed, and column name/value pairs for primary key columns. Each part is separated from the next by a comma. For ease of parsing using regular expressions, table and column names are always wrapped in double quotes, and data values are always wrapped in single quotes. Embedded quotes are doubled.</p> <p>A brief example of using the extension follows.</p> <pre data-language="sql">
