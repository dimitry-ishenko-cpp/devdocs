BRIN</a></dt> </dl> </div> <p>PostgreSQL provides several index types: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN, and the extension <a class="link" href="bloom.html" title="F.6. bloom — bloom filter index access method">bloom</a>. Each index type uses a different algorithm that is best suited to different types of indexable clauses. By default, the <a class="link" href="sql-createindex.html" title="CREATE INDEX"><code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code></a> command creates B-tree indexes, which fit the most common situations. The other index types are selected by writing the keyword <code class="literal">USING</code> followed by the index type name. For example, to create a Hash index:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE INDEX name ON table USING HASH (column);
</pre> <div class="sect2" id="id-1.5.10.5.3.3">    <h2 class="title">11.2.1. B-Tree </h2>    <p>B-trees can handle equality and range queries on data that can be sorted into some ordering. In particular, the PostgreSQL query planner will consider using a B-tree index whenever an indexed column is involved in a comparison using one of these operators:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
&lt;   &lt;=   =   &gt;=   &gt;
</pre> <p>Constructs equivalent to combinations of these operators, such as <code class="literal">BETWEEN</code> and <code class="literal">IN</code>, can also be implemented with a B-tree index search. Also, an <code class="literal">IS NULL</code> or <code class="literal">IS NOT NULL</code> condition on an index column can be used with a B-tree index.</p> <p>The optimizer can also use a B-tree index for queries involving the pattern matching operators <code class="literal">LIKE</code> and <code class="literal">~</code> <span class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> the pattern is a constant and is anchored to the beginning of the string — for example, <code class="literal">col LIKE 'foo%'</code> or <code class="literal">col ~ '^foo'</code>, but not <code class="literal">col LIKE '%bar'</code>. However, if your database does not use the C locale you will need to create the index with a special operator class to support indexing of pattern-matching queries; see <a class="xref" href="indexes-opclass.html" title="11.10. Operator Classes and Operator Families">Section 11.10</a> below. It is also possible to use B-tree indexes for <code class="literal">ILIKE</code> and <code class="literal">~*</code>, but only if the pattern starts with non-alphabetic characters, i.e., characters that are not affected by upper/lower case conversion.</p> <p>B-tree indexes can also be used to retrieve data in sorted order. This is not always faster than a simple scan and sort, but it is often helpful.</p> </div> <div class="sect2" id="id-1.5.10.5.4.3">    <h2 class="title">11.2.2. Hash </h2>    <p>Hash indexes store a 32-bit hash code derived from the value of the indexed column. Hence, such indexes can only handle simple equality comparisons. The query planner will consider using a hash index whenever an indexed column is involved in a comparison using the equal operator:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
=
</pre> </div> <div class="sect2" id="id-1.5.10.5.5.3">    <h2 class="title">11.2.3. GiST </h2>    <p>GiST indexes are not a single kind of index, but rather an infrastructure within which many different indexing strategies can be implemented. Accordingly, the particular operators with which a GiST index can be used vary depending on the indexing strategy (the <em class="firstterm">operator class</em>). As an example, the standard distribution of PostgreSQL includes GiST operator classes for several two-dimensional geometric data types, which support indexed queries using these operators:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
&lt;&lt;   &amp;&lt;   &amp;&gt;   &gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;|   &amp;&lt;|   |&amp;&gt;   |&gt;&gt;   @&gt;   &lt;@   ~=   &amp;&amp;
</pre> <p>(See <a class="xref" href="functions-geometry.html" title="9.11. Geometric Functions and Operators">Section 9.11</a> for the meaning of these operators.) The GiST operator classes included in the standard distribution are documented in <a class="xref" href="gist.html#GIST-BUILTIN-OPCLASSES-TABLE" title="Table 64.1. Built-in GiST Operator Classes">Table 64.1</a>. Many other GiST operator classes are available in the <code class="literal">contrib</code> collection or as separate projects. For more information see <a class="xref" href="gist.html" title="64.2. GiST Indexes">Section 64.2</a>.</p> <p>GiST indexes are also capable of optimizing <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">nearest-neighbor</span>”</span> searches, such as</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT * FROM places ORDER BY location &lt;-&gt; point '(101,456)' LIMIT 10;

</pre> <p>which finds the ten places closest to a given target point. The ability to do this is again dependent on the particular operator class being used. In <a class="xref" href="gist.html#GIST-BUILTIN-OPCLASSES-TABLE" title="Table 64.1. Built-in GiST Operator Classes">Table 64.1</a>, operators that can be used in this way are listed in the column <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Ordering Operators</span>”</span>.</p> </div> <div class="sect2" id="id-1.5.10.5.6.3">    <h2 class="title">11.2.4. SP-GiST </h2>    <p>SP-GiST indexes, like GiST indexes, offer an infrastructure that supports various kinds of searches. SP-GiST permits implementation of a wide range of different non-balanced disk-based data structures, such as quadtrees, k-d trees, and radix trees (tries). As an example, the standard distribution of PostgreSQL includes SP-GiST operator classes for two-dimensional points, which support indexed queries using these operators:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
&lt;&lt;   &gt;&gt;   ~=   &lt;@   &lt;&lt;|   |&gt;&gt;
</pre> <p>(See <a class="xref" href="functions-geometry.html" title="9.11. Geometric Functions and Operators">Section 9.11</a> for the meaning of these operators.) The SP-GiST operator classes included in the standard distribution are documented in <a class="xref" href="spgist.html#SPGIST-BUILTIN-OPCLASSES-TABLE" title="Table 64.2. Built-in SP-GiST Operator Classes">Table 64.2</a>. For more information see <a class="xref" href="spgist.html" title="64.3. SP-GiST Indexes">Section 64.3</a>.</p> <p>Like GiST, SP-GiST supports <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">nearest-neighbor</span>”</span> searches. For SP-GiST operator classes that support distance ordering, the corresponding operator is listed in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Ordering Operators</span>”</span> column in <a class="xref" href="spgist.html#SPGIST-BUILTIN-OPCLASSES-TABLE" title="Table 64.2. Built-in SP-GiST Operator Classes">Table 64.2</a>.</p> </div> <div class="sect2" id="id-1.5.10.5.7.3">    <h2 class="title">11.2.5. GIN </h2>    <p>GIN indexes are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">inverted indexes</span>”</span> which are appropriate for data values that contain multiple component values, such as arrays. An inverted index contains a separate entry for each component value, and can efficiently handle queries that test for the presence of specific component values.</p> <p>Like GiST and SP-GiST, GIN can support many different user-defined indexing strategies, and the particular operators with which a GIN index can be used vary depending on the indexing strategy. As an example, the standard distribution of PostgreSQL includes a GIN operator class for arrays, which supports indexed queries using these operators:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
&lt;@   @&gt;   =   &amp;&amp;
</pre> <p>(See <a class="xref" href="functions-array.html" title="9.19. Array Functions and Operators">Section 9.19</a> for the meaning of these operators.) The GIN operator classes included in the standard distribution are documented in <a class="xref" href="gin.html#GIN-BUILTIN-OPCLASSES-TABLE" title="Table 64.3. Built-in GIN Operator Classes">Table 64.3</a>. Many other GIN operator classes are available in the <code class="literal">contrib</code> collection or as separate projects. For more information see <a class="xref" href="gin.html" title="64.4. GIN Indexes">Section 64.4</a>.</p> </div> <div class="sect2" id="id-1.5.10.5.8.3">    <h2 class="title">11.2.6. BRIN </h2>    <p>BRIN indexes (a shorthand for Block Range INdexes) store summaries about the values stored in consecutive physical block ranges of a table. Thus, they are most effective for columns whose values are well-correlated with the physical order of the table rows. Like GiST, SP-GiST and GIN, BRIN can support many different indexing strategies, and the particular operators with which a BRIN index can be used vary depending on the indexing strategy. For data types that have a linear sort order, the indexed data corresponds to the minimum and maximum values of the values in the column for each block range. This supports indexed queries using these operators:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
&lt;   &lt;=   =   &gt;=   &gt;
