<h1>10.6. <code class="literal">SELECT</code> Output Columns </h1>    <p>The rules given in the preceding sections will result in assignment of non-<code class="type">unknown</code> data types to all expressions in an SQL query, except for unspecified-type literals that appear as simple output columns of a <code class="command">SELECT</code> command. For example, in</p> <pre>
SELECT 'Hello World';
</pre> <p>there is nothing to identify what type the string literal should be taken as. In this situation PostgreSQL will fall back to resolving the literal's type as <code class="type">text</code>.</p> <p>When the <code class="command">SELECT</code> is one arm of a <code class="literal">UNION</code> (or <code class="literal">INTERSECT</code> or <code class="literal">EXCEPT</code>) construct, or when it appears within <code class="command">INSERT ... SELECT</code>, this rule is not applied since rules given in preceding sections take precedence. The type of an unspecified-type literal can be taken from the other <code class="literal">UNION</code> arm in the first case, or from the destination column in the second case.</p> <p><code class="literal">RETURNING</code> lists are treated the same as <code class="command">SELECT</code> output lists for this purpose.</p> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>Prior to PostgreSQL 10, this rule did not exist, and unspecified-type literals in a <code class="command">SELECT</code> output list were left as type <code class="type">unknown</code>. That had assorted bad consequences, so it's been changed.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
