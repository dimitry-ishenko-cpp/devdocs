<h1>73.4. Visibility Map </h1>    <p>Each heap relation has a Visibility Map (VM) to keep track of which pages contain only tuples that are known to be visible to all active transactions; it also keeps track of which pages contain only frozen tuples. It's stored alongside the main relation data in a separate relation fork, named after the filenode number of the relation, plus a <code class="literal">_vm</code> suffix. For example, if the filenode of a relation is 12345, the VM is stored in a file called <code class="filename">12345_vm</code>, in the same directory as the main relation file. Note that indexes do not have VMs.</p> <p>The visibility map stores two bits per heap page. The first bit, if set, indicates that the page is all-visible, or in other words that the page does not contain any tuples that need to be vacuumed. This information can also be used by <a class="link" href="indexes-index-only-scans.html" title="11.9. Index-Only Scans and Covering Indexes"><em class="firstterm">index-only scans</em></a> to answer queries using only the index tuple. The second bit, if set, means that all tuples on the page have been frozen. That means that even an anti-wraparound vacuum need not revisit the page.</p> <p>The map is conservative in the sense that we make sure that whenever a bit is set, we know the condition is true, but if a bit is not set, it might or might not be true. Visibility map bits are only set by vacuum, but are cleared by any data-modifying operations on a page.</p> <p>The <a class="xref" href="pgvisibility.html" title="F.36. pg_visibility — visibility map information and utilities">pg_visibility</a> module can be used to examine the information stored in the visibility map.</p><div class="_attribution">
