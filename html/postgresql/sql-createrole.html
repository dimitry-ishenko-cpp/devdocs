</pre>  <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.78.5"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code class="command">CREATE ROLE</code> adds a new role to a PostgreSQL database cluster. A role is an entity that can own database objects and have database privileges; a role can be considered a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">user</span>”</span>, a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">group</span>”</span>, or both depending on how it is used. Refer to <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/user-manag.html" title="Chapter 21. Database Roles">Chapter 21</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/client-authentication.html" title="Chapter 20. Client Authentication">Chapter 20</a> for information about managing users and authentication. You must have <code class="literal">CREATEROLE</code> privilege or be a database superuser to use this command.</p> <p>Note that roles are defined at the database cluster level, and so are valid in all databases in the cluster.</p> <p>During role creation it is possible to immediately assign the newly created role to be a member of an existing role, and also assign existing roles to be members of the newly created role. The rules for which initial role membership options are enabled are described below in the <code class="literal">IN ROLE</code>, <code class="literal">ROLE</code>, and <code class="literal">ADMIN</code> clauses. The <a class="xref" href="sql-grant.html" title="GRANT">GRANT</a> command has fine-grained option control during membership creation, and the ability to modify these options after the new role is created.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.78.6"> <h2>Parameters</h2> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code>name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name of the new role.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">SUPERUSER</code><code class="literal">NOSUPERUSER</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>These clauses determine whether the new role is a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">superuser</span>”</span>, who can override all access restrictions within the database. Superuser status is dangerous and should be used only when really needed. You must yourself be a superuser to create a new superuser. If not specified, <code class="literal">NOSUPERUSER</code> is the default.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">CREATEDB</code><code class="literal">NOCREATEDB</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>These clauses define a role's ability to create databases. If <code class="literal">CREATEDB</code> is specified, the role being defined will be allowed to create new databases. Specifying <code class="literal">NOCREATEDB</code> will deny a role the ability to create databases. If not specified, <code class="literal">NOCREATEDB</code> is the default. Only superuser roles or roles with <code class="literal">CREATEDB</code> can specify <code class="literal">CREATEDB</code>.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">CREATEROLE</code><code class="literal">NOCREATEROLE</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>These clauses determine whether a role will be permitted to create, alter, drop, comment on, and change the security label for other roles. See <a class="xref" href="role-attributes.html#ROLE-CREATION">role creation</a> for more details about what capabilities are conferred by this privilege. If not specified, <code class="literal">NOCREATEROLE</code> is the default.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">INHERIT</code><code class="literal">NOINHERIT</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>This affects the membership inheritance status when this role is added as a member of another role, both in this and future commands. Specifically, it controls the inheritance status of memberships added with this command using the <code class="literal">IN ROLE</code> clause, and in later commands using the <code class="literal">ROLE</code> clause. It is also used as the default inheritance status when adding this role as a member using the <code class="literal">GRANT</code> command. If not specified, <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> is the default.</p> <p>In PostgreSQL versions before 16, inheritance was a role-level attribute that controlled all runtime membership checks for that role.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">LOGIN</code><code class="literal">NOLOGIN</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>These clauses determine whether a role is allowed to log in; that is, whether the role can be given as the initial session authorization name during client connection. A role having the <code class="literal">LOGIN</code> attribute can be thought of as a user. Roles without this attribute are useful for managing database privileges, but are not users in the usual sense of the word. If not specified, <code class="literal">NOLOGIN</code> is the default, except when <code class="command">CREATE ROLE</code> is invoked through its alternative spelling <a class="link" href="sql-createuser.html" title="CREATE USER"><code class="command">CREATE USER</code></a>.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">REPLICATION</code><code class="literal">NOREPLICATION</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>These clauses determine whether a role is a replication role. A role must have this attribute (or be a superuser) in order to be able to connect to the server in replication mode (physical or logical replication) and in order to be able to create or drop replication slots. A role having the <code class="literal">REPLICATION</code> attribute is a very highly privileged role, and should only be used on roles actually used for replication. If not specified, <code class="literal">NOREPLICATION</code> is the default. Only superuser roles or roles with <code class="literal">REPLICATION</code> can specify <code class="literal">REPLICATION</code>.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">BYPASSRLS</code><code class="literal">NOBYPASSRLS</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>These clauses determine whether a role bypasses every row-level security (RLS) policy. <code class="literal">NOBYPASSRLS</code> is the default. Only superuser roles or roles with <code class="literal">BYPASSRLS</code> can specify <code class="literal">BYPASSRLS</code>.</p> <p>Note that pg_dump will set <code class="literal">row_security</code> to <code class="literal">OFF</code> by default, to ensure all contents of a table are dumped out. If the user running pg_dump does not have appropriate permissions, an error will be returned. However, superusers and the owner of the table being dumped always bypass RLS.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">CONNECTION LIMIT</code> <code>connlimit</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>If role can log in, this specifies how many concurrent connections the role can make. -1 (the default) means no limit. Note that only normal connections are counted towards this limit. Neither prepared transactions nor background worker connections are counted towards this limit.</p> </dd> <dt>[ <code class="literal">ENCRYPTED</code> ] <code class="literal">PASSWORD</code> '<code>password</code>'<code class="literal">PASSWORD NULL</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Sets the role's password. (A password is only of use for roles having the <code class="literal">LOGIN</code> attribute, but you can nonetheless define one for roles without it.) If you do not plan to use password authentication you can omit this option. If no password is specified, the password will be set to null and password authentication will always fail for that user. A null password can optionally be written explicitly as <code class="literal">PASSWORD NULL</code>.</p> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>Specifying an empty string will also set the password to null, but that was not the case before PostgreSQL version 10. In earlier versions, an empty string could be used, or not, depending on the authentication method and the exact version, and libpq would refuse to use it in any case. To avoid the ambiguity, specifying an empty string should be avoided.</p> </blockquote> <p>The password is always stored encrypted in the system catalogs. The <code class="literal">ENCRYPTED</code> keyword has no effect, but is accepted for backwards compatibility. The method of encryption is determined by the configuration parameter <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-PASSWORD-ENCRYPTION">password_encryption</a>. If the presented password string is already in MD5-encrypted or SCRAM-encrypted format, then it is stored as-is regardless of <code class="varname">password_encryption</code> (since the system cannot decrypt the specified encrypted password string, to encrypt it in a different format). This allows reloading of encrypted passwords during dump/restore.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">VALID UNTIL</code> '<code>timestamp</code>'</dt> <dd> <p>The <code class="literal">VALID UNTIL</code> clause sets a date and time after which the role's password is no longer valid. If this clause is omitted the password will be valid for all time.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">IN ROLE</code> <code>role_name</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>The <code class="literal">IN ROLE</code> clause causes the new role to be automatically added as a member of the specified existing roles. The new membership will have the <code class="literal">SET</code> option enabled and the <code class="literal">ADMIN</code> option disabled. The <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> option will be enabled unless the <code class="literal">NOINHERIT</code> option is specified.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">ROLE</code> <code>role_name</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>The <code class="literal">ROLE</code> clause causes one or more specified existing roles to be automatically added as members, with the <code class="literal">SET</code> option enabled. This in effect makes the new role a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">group</span>”</span>. Roles named in this clause with the role-level <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> attribute will have the <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> option enabled in the new membership. New memberships will have the <code class="literal">ADMIN</code> option disabled.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">ADMIN</code> <code>role_name</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>The <code class="literal">ADMIN</code> clause has the same effect as <code class="literal">ROLE</code>, but the named roles are added as members of the new role with <code class="literal">ADMIN</code> enabled, giving them the right to grant membership in the new role to others.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">SYSID</code> <code>uid</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>The <code class="literal">SYSID</code> clause is ignored, but is accepted for backwards compatibility.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.78.7"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>Use <a class="link" href="sql-alterrole.html" title="ALTER ROLE"><code class="command">ALTER ROLE</code></a> to change the attributes of a role, and <a class="link" href="sql-droprole.html" title="DROP ROLE"><code class="command">DROP ROLE</code></a> to remove a role. All the attributes specified by <code class="command">CREATE ROLE</code> can be modified by later <code class="command">ALTER ROLE</code> commands.</p> <p>The preferred way to add and remove members of roles that are being used as groups is to use <a class="link" href="sql-grant.html" title="GRANT"><code class="command">GRANT</code></a> and <a class="link" href="sql-revoke.html" title="REVOKE"><code class="command">REVOKE</code></a>.</p> <p>The <code class="literal">VALID UNTIL</code> clause defines an expiration time for a password only, not for the role per se. In particular, the expiration time is not enforced when logging in using a non-password-based authentication method.</p> <p>The role attributes defined here are non-inheritable, i.e., being a member of a role with, e.g., <code class="literal">CREATEDB</code> will not allow the member to create new databases even if the membership grant has the <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> option. Of course, if the membership grant has the <code class="literal">SET</code> option the member role would be able to <a class="link" href="sql-set-role.html" title="SET ROLE"><code class="command">SET ROLE</code></a> to the createdb role and then create a new database.</p> <p>The membership grants created by the <code class="literal">IN ROLE</code>, <code class="literal">ROLE</code>, and <code class="literal">ADMIN</code> clauses have the role executing this command as the grantor.</p> <p>The <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> attribute is the default for reasons of backwards compatibility: in prior releases of PostgreSQL, users always had access to all privileges of groups they were members of. However, <code class="literal">NOINHERIT</code> provides a closer match to the semantics specified in the SQL standard.</p> <p>PostgreSQL includes a program <a class="xref" href="app-createuser.html" title="createuser">createuser</a> that has the same functionality as <code class="command">CREATE ROLE</code> (in fact, it calls this command) but can be run from the command shell.</p> <p>The <code class="literal">CONNECTION LIMIT</code> option is only enforced approximately; if two new sessions start at about the same time when just one connection <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">slot</span>”</span> remains for the role, it is possible that both will fail. Also, the limit is never enforced for superusers.</p> <p>Caution must be exercised when specifying an unencrypted password with this command. The password will be transmitted to the server in cleartext, and it might also be logged in the client's command history or the server log. The command <a class="xref" href="app-createuser.html" title="createuser">createuser</a>, however, transmits the password encrypted. Also, <a class="xref" href="app-psql.html" title="psql">psql</a> contains a command <code class="command">\password</code> that can be used to safely change the password later.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.78.8"> <h2>Examples</h2> <p>Create a role that can log in, but don't give it a password:</p> <pre data-language="sql">

CREATE USER davide WITH PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4';

CREATE ROLE name [ WITH ADMIN role_name ]
</pre> <p>Multiple initial administrators, and all the other options of <code class="command">CREATE ROLE</code>, are PostgreSQL extensions.</p> <p>The SQL standard defines the concepts of users and roles, but it regards them as distinct concepts and leaves all commands defining users to be specified by each database implementation. In PostgreSQL we have chosen to unify users and roles into a single kind of entity. Roles therefore have many more optional attributes than they do in the standard.</p> <p>The behavior specified by the SQL standard is most closely approximated creating SQL-standard users as PostgreSQL roles with the <code class="literal">NOINHERIT</code> option, and SQL-standard roles as PostgreSQL roles with the <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> option.</p> <p>The <code class="literal">USER</code> clause has the same behavior as <code class="literal">ROLE</code> but has been deprecated:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
