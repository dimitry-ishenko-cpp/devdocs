<h1>29.6. Conflicts </h1>    <p>Logical replication behaves similarly to normal DML operations in that the data will be updated even if it was changed locally on the subscriber node. If incoming data violates any constraints the replication will stop. This is referred to as a <em class="firstterm">conflict</em>. When replicating <code class="command">UPDATE</code> or <code class="command">DELETE</code> operations, missing data will not produce a conflict and such operations will simply be skipped.</p> <p>Logical replication operations are performed with the privileges of the role which owns the subscription. Permissions failures on target tables will cause replication conflicts, as will enabled <a class="link" href="ddl-rowsecurity.html" title="5.9. Row Security Policies">row-level security</a> on target tables that the subscription owner is subject to, without regard to whether any policy would ordinarily reject the <code class="command">INSERT</code>, <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, <code class="command">DELETE</code> or <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> which is being replicated. This restriction on row-level security may be lifted in a future version of PostgreSQL.</p> <p>A conflict will produce an error and will stop the replication; it must be resolved manually by the user. Details about the conflict can be found in the subscriber's server log.</p> <p>The resolution can be done either by changing data or permissions on the subscriber so that it does not conflict with the incoming change or by skipping the transaction that conflicts with the existing data. When a conflict produces an error, the replication won't proceed, and the logical replication worker will emit the following kind of message to the subscriber's server log:</p> <pre>
ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "test_pkey"
DETAIL:  Key (c)=(1) already exists.
CONTEXT:  processing remote data for replication origin "pg_16395" during "INSERT" for replication target relation "public.test" in transaction 725 finished at 0/14C0378
</pre> <p>The LSN of the transaction that contains the change violating the constraint and the replication origin name can be found from the server log (LSN 0/14C0378 and replication origin <code class="literal">pg_16395</code> in the above case). The transaction that produced the conflict can be skipped by using <a class="link" href="sql-altersubscription.html#SQL-ALTERSUBSCRIPTION-PARAMS-SKIP"><code class="command">ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... SKIP</code></a> with the finish LSN (i.e., LSN 0/14C0378). The finish LSN could be an LSN at which the transaction is committed or prepared on the publisher. Alternatively, the transaction can also be skipped by calling the <a class="link" href="functions-admin.html#PG-REPLICATION-ORIGIN-ADVANCE"><code class="function">pg_replication_origin_advance()</code></a> function. Before using this function, the subscription needs to be disabled temporarily either by <a class="link" href="sql-altersubscription.html#SQL-ALTERSUBSCRIPTION-PARAMS-DISABLE"><code class="command">ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... DISABLE</code></a> or, the subscription can be used with the <a class="link" href="sql-createsubscription.html#SQL-CREATESUBSCRIPTION-PARAMS-WITH-DISABLE-ON-ERROR"><code class="literal">disable_on_error</code></a> option. Then, you can use <code class="function">pg_replication_origin_advance()</code> function with the <em class="parameter"><code>node_name</code></em> (i.e., <code class="literal">pg_16395</code>) and the next LSN of the finish LSN (i.e., 0/14C0379). The current position of origins can be seen in the <a class="link" href="view-pg-replication-origin-status.html" title="52.18. pg_replication_origin_status"><code class="structname">pg_replication_origin_status</code></a> system view. Please note that skipping the whole transaction includes skipping changes that might not violate any constraint. This can easily make the subscriber inconsistent.</p> <p>When the <a class="link" href="sql-createsubscription.html#SQL-CREATESUBSCRIPTION-PARAMS-WITH-STREAMING"><code class="literal">streaming</code></a> mode is <code class="literal">parallel</code>, the finish LSN of failed transactions may not be logged. In that case, it may be necessary to change the streaming mode to <code class="literal">on</code> or <code class="literal">off</code> and cause the same conflicts again so the finish LSN of the failed transaction will be written to the server log. For the usage of finish LSN, please refer to <a class="link" href="sql-altersubscription.html" title="ALTER SUBSCRIPTION"><code class="command">ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... SKIP</code></a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
