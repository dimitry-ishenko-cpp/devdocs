<h1>2.7. Aggregate Functions </h1>    <p>Like most other relational database products, PostgreSQL supports <em class="firstterm">aggregate functions</em>. An aggregate function computes a single result from multiple input rows. For example, there are aggregates to compute the <code class="function">count</code>, <code class="function">sum</code>, <code class="function">avg</code> (average), <code class="function">max</code> (maximum) and <code class="function">min</code> (minimum) over a set of rows.</p> <p>As an example, we can find the highest low-temperature reading anywhere with:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT max(temp_lo) FROM weather;
</pre> <pre>
 max
-----
  46
(1 row)
</pre> <p id="id-1.4.4.8.5.1"> If we wanted to know what city (or cities) that reading occurred in, we might try:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT city FROM weather WHERE temp_lo = max(temp_lo);     <em class="lineannotation">WRONG</em>
</pre> <p>but this will not work since the aggregate <code class="function">max</code> cannot be used in the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause. (This restriction exists because the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause determines which rows will be included in the aggregate calculation; so obviously it has to be evaluated before aggregate functions are computed.) However, as is often the case the query can be restated to accomplish the desired result, here by using a <em class="firstterm">subquery</em>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT city FROM weather
    WHERE temp_lo = (SELECT max(temp_lo) FROM weather);
</pre> <pre>
     city
---------------
 San Francisco
(1 row)
</pre> <p>This is OK because the subquery is an independent computation that computes its own aggregate separately from what is happening in the outer query.</p> <p id="id-1.4.4.8.6.2">  Aggregates are also very useful in combination with <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code> clauses. For example, we can get the number of readings and the maximum low temperature observed in each city with:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT city, count(*), max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    GROUP BY city;
</pre> <pre>
     city      | count | max
---------------+-------+-----
 Hayward       |     1 |  37
 San Francisco |     2 |  46
(2 rows)
</pre> <p>which gives us one output row per city. Each aggregate result is computed over the table rows matching that city. We can filter these grouped rows using <code class="literal">HAVING</code>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT city, count(*), max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    GROUP BY city
    HAVING max(temp_lo) &lt; 40;
</pre> <pre>
  city   | count | max
---------+-------+-----
 Hayward |     1 |  37
(1 row)
</pre> <p>which gives us the same results for only the cities that have all <code class="structfield">temp_lo</code> values below 40. Finally, if we only care about cities whose names begin with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">S</code></span>”</span>, we might do:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT city, count(*), max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    WHERE city LIKE 'S%'            -- (1)
    GROUP BY city;
</pre> <pre>
     city      | count | max
---------------+-------+-----
 San Francisco |     2 |  46
(1 row)
</pre> <div class="calloutlist"> <table summary="Callout list"> <tr> <td width="5%" align="left"> <p><a href="#co.tutorial-agg-like">(1)</a></p> </td> <td align="left"> <p>The <code class="literal">LIKE</code> operator does pattern matching and is explained in <a class="xref" href="functions-matching.html" title="9.7. Pattern Matching">Section 9.7</a>.</p> </td> </tr> </table> </div> <p>It is important to understand the interaction between aggregates and SQL's <code class="literal">WHERE</code> and <code class="literal">HAVING</code> clauses. The fundamental difference between <code class="literal">WHERE</code> and <code class="literal">HAVING</code> is this: <code class="literal">WHERE</code> selects input rows before groups and aggregates are computed (thus, it controls which rows go into the aggregate computation), whereas <code class="literal">HAVING</code> selects group rows after groups and aggregates are computed. Thus, the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause must not contain aggregate functions; it makes no sense to try to use an aggregate to determine which rows will be inputs to the aggregates. On the other hand, the <code class="literal">HAVING</code> clause always contains aggregate functions. (Strictly speaking, you are allowed to write a <code class="literal">HAVING</code> clause that doesn't use aggregates, but it's seldom useful. The same condition could be used more efficiently at the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> stage.)</p> <p>In the previous example, we can apply the city name restriction in <code class="literal">WHERE</code>, since it needs no aggregate. This is more efficient than adding the restriction to <code class="literal">HAVING</code>, because we avoid doing the grouping and aggregate calculations for all rows that fail the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> check.</p> <p>Another way to select the rows that go into an aggregate computation is to use <code class="literal">FILTER</code>, which is a per-aggregate option:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT city, count(*) FILTER (WHERE temp_lo &lt; 45), max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    GROUP BY city;
</pre> <pre>
     city      | count | max
---------------+-------+-----
 Hayward       |     1 |  37
 San Francisco |     1 |  46
(2 rows)
</pre> <p><code class="literal">FILTER</code> is much like <code class="literal">WHERE</code>, except that it removes rows only from the input of the particular aggregate function that it is attached to. Here, the <code class="literal">count</code> aggregate counts only rows with <code class="literal">temp_lo</code> below 45; but the <code class="literal">max</code> aggregate is still applied to all rows, so it still finds the reading of 46.</p><div class="_attribution">
