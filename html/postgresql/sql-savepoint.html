<h1>SAVEPOINT</h1> <p>SAVEPOINT â€” define a new savepoint within the current transaction</p>   <h2>Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="sql">
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name
</pre>  <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.170.6"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code class="command">SAVEPOINT</code> establishes a new savepoint within the current transaction.</p> <p>A savepoint is a special mark inside a transaction that allows all commands that are executed after it was established to be rolled back, restoring the transaction state to what it was at the time of the savepoint.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.170.7"> <h2>Parameters</h2> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code>savepoint_name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name to give to the new savepoint. If savepoints with the same name already exist, they will be inaccessible until newer identically-named savepoints are released.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.170.8"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>Use <a class="link" href="sql-rollback-to.html" title="ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT"><code class="command">ROLLBACK TO</code></a> to rollback to a savepoint. Use <a class="link" href="sql-release-savepoint.html" title="RELEASE SAVEPOINT"><code class="command">RELEASE SAVEPOINT</code></a> to destroy a savepoint, keeping the effects of commands executed after it was established.</p> <p>Savepoints can only be established when inside a transaction block. There can be multiple savepoints defined within a transaction.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.170.9"> <h2>Examples</h2> <p>To establish a savepoint and later undo the effects of all commands executed after it was established:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (1);
    SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (2);
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (3);
COMMIT;
</pre> <p>The above transaction will insert the values 1 and 3, but not 2.</p> <p>To establish and later destroy a savepoint:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (3);
    SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (4);
    RELEASE SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
COMMIT;
</pre> <p>The above transaction will insert both 3 and 4.</p> <p>To use a single savepoint name:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (1);
    SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (2);
    SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (3);

    -- rollback to the second savepoint
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    SELECT * FROM table1;               -- shows rows 1 and 2

    -- release the second savepoint
    RELEASE SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

    -- rollback to the first savepoint
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    SELECT * FROM table1;               -- shows only row 1
COMMIT;
</pre> <p>The above transaction shows row 3 being rolled back first, then row 2.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.170.10"> <h2>Compatibility</h2> <p>SQL requires a savepoint to be destroyed automatically when another savepoint with the same name is established. In PostgreSQL, the old savepoint is kept, though only the more recent one will be used when rolling back or releasing. (Releasing the newer savepoint with <code class="command">RELEASE SAVEPOINT</code> will cause the older one to again become accessible to <code class="command">ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</code> and <code class="command">RELEASE SAVEPOINT</code>.) Otherwise, <code class="command">SAVEPOINT</code> is fully SQL conforming.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.170.11"> <h2>See Also</h2>
