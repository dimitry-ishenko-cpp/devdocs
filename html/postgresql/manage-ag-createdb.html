<h1>22.2. Creating a Database </h1>    <p>In order to create a database, the PostgreSQL server must be up and running (see <a class="xref" href="server-start.html" title="18.3. Starting the Database Server">Section 18.3</a>).</p> <p>Databases are created with the SQL command <a class="xref" href="sql-createdatabase.html" title="CREATE DATABASE">CREATE DATABASE</a>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE DATABASE name;
</pre> <p>where <code>name</code> follows the usual rules for SQL identifiers. The current role automatically becomes the owner of the new database. It is the privilege of the owner of a database to remove it later (which also removes all the objects in it, even if they have a different owner).</p> <p>The creation of databases is a restricted operation. See <a class="xref" href="role-attributes.html" title="21.2. Role Attributes">Section 21.2</a> for how to grant permission.</p> <p id="id-1.6.9.5.6.6">Since you need to be connected to the database server in order to execute the <code class="command">CREATE DATABASE</code> command, the question remains how the <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> database at any given site can be created. The first database is always created by the <code class="command">initdb</code> command when the data storage area is initialized. (See <a class="xref" href="creating-cluster.html" title="18.2. Creating a Database Cluster">Section 18.2</a>.) This database is called <code class="literal">postgres</code>. So to create the first <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">ordinary</span>”</span> database you can connect to <code class="literal">postgres</code>.</p> <p id="id-1.6.9.5.7.4">Two additional databases, <code class="literal">template1</code> and <code class="literal">template0</code>, are also created during database cluster initialization. Whenever a new database is created within the cluster, <code class="literal">template1</code> is essentially cloned. This means that any changes you make in <code class="literal">template1</code> are propagated to all subsequently created databases. Because of this, avoid creating objects in <code class="literal">template1</code> unless you want them propagated to every newly created database. <code class="literal">template0</code> is meant as a pristine copy of the original contents of <code class="literal">template1</code>. It can be cloned instead of <code class="literal">template1</code> when it is important to make a database without any such site-local additions. More details appear in <a class="xref" href="manage-ag-templatedbs.html" title="22.3. Template Databases">Section 22.3</a>.</p> <p id="id-1.6.9.5.8.2">As a convenience, there is a program you can execute from the shell to create new databases, <code class="command">createdb</code>.</p> <pre data-language="sql">
createdb dbname
</pre> <p><code class="command">createdb</code> does no magic. It connects to the <code class="literal">postgres</code> database and issues the <code class="command">CREATE DATABASE</code> command, exactly as described above. The <a class="xref" href="app-createdb.html" title="createdb">createdb</a> reference page contains the invocation details. Note that <code class="command">createdb</code> without any arguments will create a database with the current user name.</p> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p><a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/client-authentication.html" title="Chapter 20. Client Authentication">Chapter 20</a> contains information about how to restrict who can connect to a given database.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sometimes you want to create a database for someone else, and have them become the owner of the new database, so they can configure and manage it themselves. To achieve that, use one of the following commands:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE DATABASE dbname OWNER rolename;
</pre> <p>from the SQL environment, or:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
createdb -O rolename dbname
</pre> <p>from the shell. Only the superuser is allowed to create a database for someone else (that is, for a role you are not a member of).</p><div class="_attribution">
