<h1>77.3. Backup Manifest WAL Range Object </h1>    <p>The object which describes a WAL range always has three keys:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code class="literal">Timeline</code></dt> <dd> <p>The timeline for this range of WAL records, as an integer.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">Start-LSN</code></dt> <dd> <p>The LSN at which replay must begin on the indicated timeline in order to make use of this backup. The LSN is stored in the format normally used by PostgreSQL; that is, it is a string consisting of two strings of hexadecimal characters, each with a length of between 1 and 8, separated by a slash.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">End-LSN</code></dt> <dd> <p>The earliest LSN at which replay on the indicated timeline may end when making use of this backup. This is stored in the same format as <code class="literal">Start-LSN</code>.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Ordinarily, there will be only a single WAL range. However, if a backup is taken from a standby which switches timelines during the backup due to an upstream promotion, it is possible for multiple ranges to be present, each with a different timeline. There will never be multiple WAL ranges present for the same timeline.</p><div class="_attribution">
