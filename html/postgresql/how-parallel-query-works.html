<h1>15.1. How Parallel Query Works </h1>    <p>When the optimizer determines that parallel query is the fastest execution strategy for a particular query, it will create a query plan that includes a <em class="firstterm">Gather</em> or <em class="firstterm">Gather Merge</em> node. Here is a simple example:</p> <pre>
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM pgbench_accounts WHERE filler LIKE '%x%';
                                     QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------------
 Gather  (cost=1000.00..217018.43 rows=1 width=97)
   Workers Planned: 2
   -&gt;  Parallel Seq Scan on pgbench_accounts  (cost=0.00..216018.33 rows=1 width=97)
         Filter: (filler ~~ '%x%'::text)
(4 rows)
</pre> <p>In all cases, the <code class="literal">Gather</code> or <code class="literal">Gather Merge</code> node will have exactly one child plan, which is the portion of the plan that will be executed in parallel. If the <code class="literal">Gather</code> or <code class="literal">Gather Merge</code> node is at the very top of the plan tree, then the entire query will execute in parallel. If it is somewhere else in the plan tree, then only the portion of the plan below it will run in parallel. In the example above, the query accesses only one table, so there is only one plan node other than the <code class="literal">Gather</code> node itself; since that plan node is a child of the <code class="literal">Gather</code> node, it will run in parallel.</p> <p><a class="link" href="using-explain.html" title="14.1. Using EXPLAIN">Using EXPLAIN</a>, you can see the number of workers chosen by the planner. When the <code class="literal">Gather</code> node is reached during query execution, the process that is implementing the user's session will request a number of <a class="link" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/bgworker.html" title="Chapter 48. Background Worker Processes">background worker processes</a> equal to the number of workers chosen by the planner. The number of background workers that the planner will consider using is limited to at most <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-PARALLEL-WORKERS-PER-GATHER">max_parallel_workers_per_gather</a>. The total number of background workers that can exist at any one time is limited by both <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-WORKER-PROCESSES">max_worker_processes</a> and <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-PARALLEL-WORKERS">max_parallel_workers</a>. Therefore, it is possible for a parallel query to run with fewer workers than planned, or even with no workers at all. The optimal plan may depend on the number of workers that are available, so this can result in poor query performance. If this occurrence is frequent, consider increasing <code class="varname">max_worker_processes</code> and <code class="varname">max_parallel_workers</code> so that more workers can be run simultaneously or alternatively reducing <code class="varname">max_parallel_workers_per_gather</code> so that the planner requests fewer workers.</p> <p>Every background worker process that is successfully started for a given parallel query will execute the parallel portion of the plan. The leader will also execute that portion of the plan, but it has an additional responsibility: it must also read all of the tuples generated by the workers. When the parallel portion of the plan generates only a small number of tuples, the leader will often behave very much like an additional worker, speeding up query execution. Conversely, when the parallel portion of the plan generates a large number of tuples, the leader may be almost entirely occupied with reading the tuples generated by the workers and performing any further processing steps that are required by plan nodes above the level of the <code class="literal">Gather</code> node or <code class="literal">Gather Merge</code> node. In such cases, the leader will do very little of the work of executing the parallel portion of the plan.</p> <p>When the node at the top of the parallel portion of the plan is <code class="literal">Gather Merge</code> rather than <code class="literal">Gather</code>, it indicates that each process executing the parallel portion of the plan is producing tuples in sorted order, and that the leader is performing an order-preserving merge. In contrast, <code class="literal">Gather</code> reads tuples from the workers in whatever order is convenient, destroying any sort order that may have existed.</p><div class="_attribution">
