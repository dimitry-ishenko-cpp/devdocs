<h1>5.6. System Columns </h1>    <p>Every table has several <em class="firstterm">system columns</em> that are implicitly defined by the system. Therefore, these names cannot be used as names of user-defined columns. (Note that these restrictions are separate from whether the name is a key word or not; quoting a name will not allow you to escape these restrictions.) You do not really need to be concerned about these columns; just know they exist.</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt id="DDL-SYSTEM-COLUMNS-TABLEOID">
<code class="structfield">tableoid</code> </dt> <dd id="id-1.5.4.8.4.1.2.1">  <p>The OID of the table containing this row. This column is particularly handy for queries that select from partitioned tables (see <a class="xref" href="ddl-partitioning.html" title="5.12. Table Partitioning">Section 5.12</a>) or inheritance hierarchies (see <a class="xref" href="ddl-inherit.html" title="5.11. Inheritance">Section 5.11</a>), since without it, it's difficult to tell which individual table a row came from. The <code class="structfield">tableoid</code> can be joined against the <code class="structfield">oid</code> column of <code class="structname">pg_class</code> to obtain the table name.</p> </dd> <dt id="DDL-SYSTEM-COLUMNS-XMIN">
<code class="structfield">xmin</code> </dt> <dd id="id-1.5.4.8.4.2.2.1">  <p>The identity (transaction ID) of the inserting transaction for this row version. (A row version is an individual state of a row; each update of a row creates a new row version for the same logical row.)</p> </dd> <dt id="DDL-SYSTEM-COLUMNS-CMIN">
<code class="structfield">cmin</code> </dt> <dd id="id-1.5.4.8.4.3.2.1">  <p>The command identifier (starting at zero) within the inserting transaction.</p> </dd> <dt id="DDL-SYSTEM-COLUMNS-XMAX">
<code class="structfield">xmax</code> </dt> <dd id="id-1.5.4.8.4.4.2.1">  <p>The identity (transaction ID) of the deleting transaction, or zero for an undeleted row version. It is possible for this column to be nonzero in a visible row version. That usually indicates that the deleting transaction hasn't committed yet, or that an attempted deletion was rolled back.</p> </dd> <dt id="DDL-SYSTEM-COLUMNS-CMAX">
<code class="structfield">cmax</code> </dt> <dd id="id-1.5.4.8.4.5.2.1">  <p>The command identifier within the deleting transaction, or zero.</p> </dd> <dt id="DDL-SYSTEM-COLUMNS-CTID">
<code class="structfield">ctid</code> </dt> <dd id="id-1.5.4.8.4.6.2.1">  <p>The physical location of the row version within its table. Note that although the <code class="structfield">ctid</code> can be used to locate the row version very quickly, a row's <code class="structfield">ctid</code> will change if it is updated or moved by <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code>. Therefore <code class="structfield">ctid</code> is useless as a long-term row identifier. A primary key should be used to identify logical rows.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Transaction identifiers are also 32-bit quantities. In a long-lived database it is possible for transaction IDs to wrap around. This is not a fatal problem given appropriate maintenance procedures; see <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/maintenance.html" title="Chapter 24. Routine Database Maintenance Tasks">Chapter 24</a> for details. It is unwise, however, to depend on the uniqueness of transaction IDs over the long term (more than one billion transactions).</p> <p>Command identifiers are also 32-bit quantities. This creates a hard limit of 2<sup>32</sup> (4 billion) SQL commands within a single transaction. In practice this limit is not a problem — note that the limit is on the number of SQL commands, not the number of rows processed. Also, only commands that actually modify the database contents will consume a command identifier.</p><div class="_attribution">
