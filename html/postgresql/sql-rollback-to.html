<h1>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</h1> <p>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT â€” roll back to a savepoint</p>   <h2>Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="sql">
ROLLBACK [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] TO [ SAVEPOINT ] savepoint_name
</pre>  <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.169.6"> <h2>Description</h2> <p>Roll back all commands that were executed after the savepoint was established and then start a new subtransaction at the same transaction level. The savepoint remains valid and can be rolled back to again later, if needed.</p> <p><code class="command">ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</code> implicitly destroys all savepoints that were established after the named savepoint.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.169.7"> <h2>Parameters</h2> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code>savepoint_name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The savepoint to roll back to.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.169.8"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>Use <a class="link" href="sql-release-savepoint.html" title="RELEASE SAVEPOINT"><code class="command">RELEASE SAVEPOINT</code></a> to destroy a savepoint without discarding the effects of commands executed after it was established.</p> <p>Specifying a savepoint name that has not been established is an error.</p> <p>Cursors have somewhat non-transactional behavior with respect to savepoints. Any cursor that is opened inside a savepoint will be closed when the savepoint is rolled back. If a previously opened cursor is affected by a <code class="command">FETCH</code> or <code class="command">MOVE</code> command inside a savepoint that is later rolled back, the cursor remains at the position that <code class="command">FETCH</code> left it pointing to (that is, the cursor motion caused by <code class="command">FETCH</code> is not rolled back). Closing a cursor is not undone by rolling back, either. However, other side-effects caused by the cursor's query (such as side-effects of volatile functions called by the query) <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> rolled back if they occur during a savepoint that is later rolled back. A cursor whose execution causes a transaction to abort is put in a cannot-execute state, so while the transaction can be restored using <code class="command">ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</code>, the cursor can no longer be used.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.169.9"> <h2>Examples</h2> <p>To undo the effects of the commands executed after <code class="literal">my_savepoint</code> was established:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
</pre> <p>Cursor positions are not affected by savepoint rollback:</p> <pre data-language="sql">

</pre> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.169.10"> <h2>Compatibility</h2> <p>The SQL standard specifies that the key word <code class="literal">SAVEPOINT</code> is mandatory, but PostgreSQL and Oracle allow it to be omitted. SQL allows only <code class="literal">WORK</code>, not <code class="literal">TRANSACTION</code>, as a noise word after <code class="literal">ROLLBACK</code>. Also, SQL has an optional clause <code class="literal">AND [ NO ] CHAIN</code> which is not currently supported by PostgreSQL. Otherwise, this command conforms to the SQL standard.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.169.11"> <h2>See Also</h2>
