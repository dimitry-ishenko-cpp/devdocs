<h1>22.4. Database Configuration </h1>    <p>Recall from <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/runtime-config.html" title="Chapter 19. Server Configuration">Chapter 19</a> that the PostgreSQL server provides a large number of run-time configuration variables. You can set database-specific default values for many of these settings.</p> <p>For example, if for some reason you want to disable the GEQO optimizer for a given database, you'd ordinarily have to either disable it for all databases or make sure that every connecting client is careful to issue <code class="literal">SET geqo TO off</code>. To make this setting the default within a particular database, you can execute the command:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
ALTER DATABASE mydb SET geqo TO off;
</pre> <p>This will save the setting (but not set it immediately). In subsequent connections to this database it will appear as though <code class="literal">SET geqo TO off;</code> had been executed just before the session started. Note that users can still alter this setting during their sessions; it will only be the default. To undo any such setting, use <code class="literal">ALTER DATABASE dbname RESET varname</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
