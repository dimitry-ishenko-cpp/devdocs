<h1>B.2. Handling of Invalid or Ambiguous Timestamps </h1>    <p>Ordinarily, if a date/time string is syntactically valid but contains out-of-range field values, an error will be thrown. For example, input specifying the 31st of February will be rejected.</p> <p>During a daylight-savings-time transition, it is possible for a seemingly valid timestamp string to represent a nonexistent or ambiguous timestamp. Such cases are not rejected; the ambiguity is resolved by determining which UTC offset to apply. For example, supposing that the <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-TIMEZONE">TimeZone</a> parameter is set to <code class="literal">America/New_York</code>, consider</p> <pre data-language="sql">
=&gt; SELECT '2018-03-11 02:30'::timestamptz;
      timestamptz
------------------------
 2018-03-11 03:30:00-04
(1 row)
</pre> <p>Because that day was a spring-forward transition date in that time zone, there was no civil time instant 2:30AM; clocks jumped forward from 2AM EST to 3AM EDT. PostgreSQL interprets the given time as if it were standard time (UTC-5), which then renders as 3:30AM EDT (UTC-4).</p> <p>Conversely, consider the behavior during a fall-back transition:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
=&gt; SELECT '2018-11-04 01:30'::timestamptz;
      timestamptz
------------------------
 2018-11-04 01:30:00-05
(1 row)
</pre> <p>On that date, there were two possible interpretations of 1:30AM; there was 1:30AM EDT, and then an hour later after clocks jumped back from 2AM EDT to 1AM EST, there was 1:30AM EST. Again, PostgreSQL interprets the given time as if it were standard time (UTC-5). We can force the other interpretation by specifying daylight-savings time:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
=&gt; SELECT '2018-11-04 01:30 EDT'::timestamptz;
      timestamptz
------------------------
 2018-11-04 01:30:00-04
(1 row)
</pre> <p>The precise rule that is applied in such cases is that an invalid timestamp that appears to fall within a jump-forward daylight savings transition is assigned the UTC offset that prevailed in the time zone just before the transition, while an ambiguous timestamp that could fall on either side of a jump-back transition is assigned the UTC offset that prevailed just after the transition. In most time zones this is equivalent to saying that <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the standard-time interpretation is preferred when in doubt</span>”</span>.</p> <p>In all cases, the UTC offset associated with a timestamp can be specified explicitly, using either a numeric UTC offset or a time zone abbreviation that corresponds to a fixed UTC offset. The rule just given applies only when it is necessary to infer a UTC offset for a time zone in which the offset varies.</p><div class="_attribution">
