EXISTS (subquery)
</pre> <p>The argument of <code class="token">EXISTS</code> is an arbitrary <code class="command">SELECT</code> statement, or <em class="firstterm">subquery</em>. The subquery is evaluated to determine whether it returns any rows. If it returns at least one row, the result of <code class="token">EXISTS</code> is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">true</span>”</span>; if the subquery returns no rows, the result of <code class="token">EXISTS</code> is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">false</span>”</span>.</p> <p>The subquery can refer to variables from the surrounding query, which will act as constants during any one evaluation of the subquery.</p> <p>The subquery will generally only be executed long enough to determine whether at least one row is returned, not all the way to completion. It is unwise to write a subquery that has side effects (such as calling sequence functions); whether the side effects occur might be unpredictable.</p> <p>Since the result depends only on whether any rows are returned, and not on the contents of those rows, the output list of the subquery is normally unimportant. A common coding convention is to write all <code class="literal">EXISTS</code> tests in the form <code class="literal">EXISTS(SELECT 1 WHERE ...)</code>. There are exceptions to this rule however, such as subqueries that use <code class="token">INTERSECT</code>.</p> <p>This simple example is like an inner join on <code class="literal">col2</code>, but it produces at most one output row for each <code class="literal">tab1</code> row, even if there are several matching <code class="literal">tab2</code> rows:</p> <pre>
SELECT col1
