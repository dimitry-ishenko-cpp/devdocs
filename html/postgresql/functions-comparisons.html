Row Constructor Comparison </h2>    <pre data-language="sql">
row_constructor operator row_constructor
</pre> <p>Each side is a row constructor, as described in <a class="xref" href="sql-expressions.html#SQL-SYNTAX-ROW-CONSTRUCTORS" title="4.2.13. Row Constructors">Section 4.2.13</a>. The two row constructors must have the same number of fields. The given <code>operator</code> is applied to each pair of corresponding fields. (Since the fields could be of different types, this means that a different specific operator could be selected for each pair.) All the selected operators must be members of some B-tree operator class, or be the negator of an <code class="literal">=</code> member of a B-tree operator class, meaning that row constructor comparison is only possible when the <code>operator</code> is <code class="literal">=</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;&gt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;=</code>, <code class="literal">&gt;</code>, or <code class="literal">&gt;=</code>, or has semantics similar to one of these.</p> <p>The <code class="literal">=</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;&gt;</code> cases work slightly differently from the others. Two rows are considered equal if all their corresponding members are non-null and equal; the rows are unequal if any corresponding members are non-null and unequal; otherwise the result of the row comparison is unknown (null).</p> <p>For the <code class="literal">&lt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;=</code>, <code class="literal">&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&gt;=</code> cases, the row elements are compared left-to-right, stopping as soon as an unequal or null pair of elements is found. If either of this pair of elements is null, the result of the row comparison is unknown (null); otherwise comparison of this pair of elements determines the result. For example, <code class="literal">ROW(1,2,NULL) &lt; ROW(1,3,0)</code> yields true, not null, because the third pair of elements are not considered.</p> <pre data-language="sql">
row_constructor IS DISTINCT FROM row_constructor
</pre> <p>This construct is similar to a <code class="literal">&lt;&gt;</code> row comparison, but it does not yield null for null inputs. Instead, any null value is considered unequal to (distinct from) any non-null value, and any two nulls are considered equal (not distinct). Thus the result will either be true or false, never null.</p> <pre data-language="sql">
row_constructor IS NOT DISTINCT FROM row_constructor
</pre> <p>This construct is similar to a <code class="literal">=</code> row comparison, but it does not yield null for null inputs. Instead, any null value is considered unequal to (distinct from) any non-null value, and any two nulls are considered equal (not distinct). Thus the result will always be either true or false, never null.</p> </div> <div class="sect2" id="COMPOSITE-TYPE-COMPARISON">    <h2 class="title">9.25.6. Composite Type Comparison </h2>    <pre data-language="sql">
record operator record
</pre> <p>The SQL specification requires row-wise comparison to return NULL if the result depends on comparing two NULL values or a NULL and a non-NULL. PostgreSQL does this only when comparing the results of two row constructors (as in <a class="xref" href="functions-comparisons.html#ROW-WISE-COMPARISON" title="9.25.5. Row Constructor Comparison">Section 9.25.5</a>) or comparing a row constructor to the output of a subquery (as in <a class="xref" href="functions-subquery.html" title="9.24. Subquery Expressions">Section 9.24</a>). In other contexts where two composite-type values are compared, two NULL field values are considered equal, and a NULL is considered larger than a non-NULL. This is necessary in order to have consistent sorting and indexing behavior for composite types.</p> <p>Each side is evaluated and they are compared row-wise. Composite type comparisons are allowed when the <code>operator</code> is <code class="literal">=</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;&gt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;=</code>, <code class="literal">&gt;</code> or <code class="literal">&gt;=</code>, or has semantics similar to one of these. (To be specific, an operator can be a row comparison operator if it is a member of a B-tree operator class, or is the negator of the <code class="literal">=</code> member of a B-tree operator class.) The default behavior of the above operators is the same as for <code class="literal">IS [ NOT ] DISTINCT FROM</code> for row constructors (see <a class="xref" href="functions-comparisons.html#ROW-WISE-COMPARISON" title="9.25.5. Row Constructor Comparison">Section 9.25.5</a>).</p> <p>To support matching of rows which include elements without a default B-tree operator class, the following operators are defined for composite type comparison: <code class="literal">*=</code>, <code class="literal">*&lt;&gt;</code>, <code class="literal">*&lt;</code>, <code class="literal">*&lt;=</code>, <code class="literal">*&gt;</code>, and <code class="literal">*&gt;=</code>. These operators compare the internal binary representation of the two rows. Two rows might have a different binary representation even though comparisons of the two rows with the equality operator is true. The ordering of rows under these comparison operators is deterministic but not otherwise meaningful. These operators are used internally for materialized views and might be useful for other specialized purposes such as replication and B-Tree deduplication (see <a class="xref" href="btree.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" title="64.1.4.3. Deduplication">Section 64.1.4.3</a>). They are not intended to be generally useful for writing queries, though.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
