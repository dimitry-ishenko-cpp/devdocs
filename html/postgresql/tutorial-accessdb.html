<h1>1.4. Accessing a Database </h1>    <p>Once you have created a database, you can access it by:</p>  <ul> <li> <p>Running the PostgreSQL interactive terminal program, called <em class="firstterm">psql</em>, which allows you to interactively enter, edit, and execute SQL commands.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using an existing graphical frontend tool like pgAdmin or an office suite with ODBC or JDBC support to create and manipulate a database. These possibilities are not covered in this tutorial.</p> </li> <li> <p>Writing a custom application, using one of the several available language bindings. These possibilities are discussed further in <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/client-interfaces.html" title="Part IV. Client Interfaces">Part IV</a>.</p> </li> </ul>  <p>You probably want to start up <code class="command">psql</code> to try the examples in this tutorial. It can be activated for the <code class="literal">mydb</code> database by typing the command:</p> <pre>
$ <strong class="userinput">psql mydb</strong>
</pre> <p>If you do not supply the database name then it will default to your user account name. You already discovered this scheme in the previous section using <code class="command">createdb</code>.</p> <p>In <code class="command">psql</code>, you will be greeted with the following message:</p> <pre>
psql (16.1)
Type "help" for help.

mydb=&gt;
</pre> <p id="id-1.4.3.5.4.3"> The last line could also be:</p> <pre>
mydb=#
</pre> <p>That would mean you are a database superuser, which is most likely the case if you installed the PostgreSQL instance yourself. Being a superuser means that you are not subject to access controls. For the purposes of this tutorial that is not important.</p> <p>If you encounter problems starting <code class="command">psql</code> then go back to the previous section. The diagnostics of <code class="command">createdb</code> and <code class="command">psql</code> are similar, and if the former worked the latter should work as well.</p> <p id="id-1.4.3.5.6.5">The last line printed out by <code class="command">psql</code> is the prompt, and it indicates that <code class="command">psql</code> is listening to you and that you can type SQL queries into a work space maintained by <code class="command">psql</code>. Try out these commands: </p> <pre>
mydb=&gt; <strong class="userinput">SELECT version();</strong>
                                         version
-------------------------------------------------------------------​-----------------------
 PostgreSQL 16.1 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 4.9.2-10) 4.9.2, 64-bit
(1 row)

mydb=&gt; <strong class="userinput">SELECT current_date;</strong>
    date
------------

(1 row)

mydb=&gt; <strong class="userinput">SELECT 2 + 2;</strong>
 ?column?

        4
(1 row)
</pre> <p>The <code class="command">psql</code> program has a number of internal commands that are not SQL commands. They begin with the backslash character, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">\</code></span>”</span>. For example, you can get help on the syntax of various PostgreSQL SQL commands by typing:</p> <pre>
mydb=&gt; <strong class="userinput">\h</strong>
</pre> <p>To get out of <code class="command">psql</code>, type:</p> <pre>
mydb=&gt; <strong class="userinput">\q</strong>
</pre> <p>and <code class="command">psql</code> will quit and return you to your command shell. (For more internal commands, type <code class="literal">\?</code> at the <code class="command">psql</code> prompt.) The full capabilities of <code class="command">psql</code> are documented in <a class="xref" href="app-psql.html" title="psql">psql</a>. In this tutorial we will not use these features explicitly, but you can use them yourself when it is helpful.</p><div class="_attribution">
