</pre>  <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.57.5"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code class="command">CREATE AGGREGATE</code> defines a new aggregate function. <code class="command">CREATE OR REPLACE AGGREGATE</code> will either define a new aggregate function or replace an existing definition. Some basic and commonly-used aggregate functions are included with the distribution; they are documented in <a class="xref" href="functions-aggregate.html" title="9.21. Aggregate Functions">Section 9.21</a>. If one defines new types or needs an aggregate function not already provided, then <code class="command">CREATE AGGREGATE</code> can be used to provide the desired features.</p> <p>When replacing an existing definition, the argument types, result type, and number of direct arguments may not be changed. Also, the new definition must be of the same kind (ordinary aggregate, ordered-set aggregate, or hypothetical-set aggregate) as the old one.</p> <p>If a schema name is given (for example, <code class="literal">CREATE AGGREGATE myschema.myagg ...</code>) then the aggregate function is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema.</p> <p>An aggregate function is identified by its name and input data type(s). Two aggregates in the same schema can have the same name if they operate on different input types. The name and input data type(s) of an aggregate must also be distinct from the name and input data type(s) of every ordinary function in the same schema. This behavior is identical to overloading of ordinary function names (see <a class="xref" href="sql-createfunction.html" title="CREATE FUNCTION">CREATE FUNCTION</a>).</p> <p>A simple aggregate function is made from one or two ordinary functions: a state transition function <code>sfunc</code>, and an optional final calculation function <code>ffunc</code>. These are used as follows:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
sfunc( internal-state, next-data-values ) ---&gt; next-internal-state
ffunc( internal-state ) ---&gt; aggregate-value
</pre> <p>PostgreSQL creates a temporary variable of data type <code>stype</code> to hold the current internal state of the aggregate. At each input row, the aggregate argument value(s) are calculated and the state transition function is invoked with the current state value and the new argument value(s) to calculate a new internal state value. After all the rows have been processed, the final function is invoked once to calculate the aggregate's return value. If there is no final function then the ending state value is returned as-is.</p> <p>An aggregate function can provide an initial condition, that is, an initial value for the internal state value. This is specified and stored in the database as a value of type <code class="type">text</code>, but it must be a valid external representation of a constant of the state value data type. If it is not supplied then the state value starts out null.</p> <p>If the state transition function is declared <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">strict</span>”</span>, then it cannot be called with null inputs. With such a transition function, aggregate execution behaves as follows. Rows with any null input values are ignored (the function is not called and the previous state value is retained). If the initial state value is null, then at the first row with all-nonnull input values, the first argument value replaces the state value, and the transition function is invoked at each subsequent row with all-nonnull input values. This is handy for implementing aggregates like <code class="function">max</code>. Note that this behavior is only available when <code>state_data_type</code> is the same as the first <code>arg_data_type</code>. When these types are different, you must supply a nonnull initial condition or use a nonstrict transition function.</p> <p>If the state transition function is not strict, then it will be called unconditionally at each input row, and must deal with null inputs and null state values for itself. This allows the aggregate author to have full control over the aggregate's handling of null values.</p> <p>If the final function is declared <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">strict</span>”</span>, then it will not be called when the ending state value is null; instead a null result will be returned automatically. (Of course this is just the normal behavior of strict functions.) In any case the final function has the option of returning a null value. For example, the final function for <code class="function">avg</code> returns null when it sees there were zero input rows.</p> <p>Sometimes it is useful to declare the final function as taking not just the state value, but extra parameters corresponding to the aggregate's input values. The main reason for doing this is if the final function is polymorphic and the state value's data type would be inadequate to pin down the result type. These extra parameters are always passed as NULL (and so the final function must not be strict when the <code class="literal">FINALFUNC_EXTRA</code> option is used), but nonetheless they are valid parameters. The final function could for example make use of <code class="function">get_fn_expr_argtype</code> to identify the actual argument type in the current call.</p> <p>An aggregate can optionally support <em class="firstterm">moving-aggregate mode</em>, as described in <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/xaggr.html#XAGGR-MOVING-AGGREGATES" title="38.12.1. Moving-Aggregate Mode">Section 38.12.1</a>. This requires specifying the <code class="literal">MSFUNC</code>, <code class="literal">MINVFUNC</code>, and <code class="literal">MSTYPE</code> parameters, and optionally the <code class="literal">MSSPACE</code>, <code class="literal">MFINALFUNC</code>, <code class="literal">MFINALFUNC_EXTRA</code>, <code class="literal">MFINALFUNC_MODIFY</code>, and <code class="literal">MINITCOND</code> parameters. Except for <code class="literal">MINVFUNC</code>, these parameters work like the corresponding simple-aggregate parameters without <code class="literal">M</code>; they define a separate implementation of the aggregate that includes an inverse transition function.</p> <p>The syntax with <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code> in the parameter list creates a special type of aggregate called an <em class="firstterm">ordered-set aggregate</em>; or if <code class="literal">HYPOTHETICAL</code> is specified, then a <em class="firstterm">hypothetical-set aggregate</em> is created. These aggregates operate over groups of sorted values in order-dependent ways, so that specification of an input sort order is an essential part of a call. Also, they can have <em class="firstterm">direct</em> arguments, which are arguments that are evaluated only once per aggregation rather than once per input row. Hypothetical-set aggregates are a subclass of ordered-set aggregates in which some of the direct arguments are required to match, in number and data types, the aggregated argument columns. This allows the values of those direct arguments to be added to the collection of aggregate-input rows as an additional <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hypothetical</span>”</span> row.</p> <p>An aggregate can optionally support <em class="firstterm">partial aggregation</em>, as described in <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/xaggr.html#XAGGR-PARTIAL-AGGREGATES" title="38.12.4. Partial Aggregation">Section 38.12.4</a>. This requires specifying the <code class="literal">COMBINEFUNC</code> parameter. If the <code>state_data_type</code> is <code class="type">internal</code>, it's usually also appropriate to provide the <code class="literal">SERIALFUNC</code> and <code class="literal">DESERIALFUNC</code> parameters so that parallel aggregation is possible. Note that the aggregate must also be marked <code class="literal">PARALLEL SAFE</code> to enable parallel aggregation.</p> <p>Aggregates that behave like <code class="function">MIN</code> or <code class="function">MAX</code> can sometimes be optimized by looking into an index instead of scanning every input row. If this aggregate can be so optimized, indicate it by specifying a <em class="firstterm">sort operator</em>. The basic requirement is that the aggregate must yield the first element in the sort ordering induced by the operator; in other words:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT agg(col) FROM tab;
</pre> <p>must be equivalent to:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SELECT col FROM tab ORDER BY col USING sortop LIMIT 1;
</pre> <p>Further assumptions are that the aggregate ignores null inputs, and that it delivers a null result if and only if there were no non-null inputs. Ordinarily, a data type's <code class="literal">&lt;</code> operator is the proper sort operator for <code class="function">MIN</code>, and <code class="literal">&gt;</code> is the proper sort operator for <code class="function">MAX</code>. Note that the optimization will never actually take effect unless the specified operator is the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">less than</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">greater than</span>”</span> strategy member of a B-tree index operator class.</p> <p>To be able to create an aggregate function, you must have <code class="literal">USAGE</code> privilege on the argument types, the state type(s), and the return type, as well as <code class="literal">EXECUTE</code> privilege on the supporting functions.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.57.6"> <h2>Parameters</h2> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code>name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the aggregate function to create.</p> </dd> <dt><code>argmode</code></dt> <dd> <p>The mode of an argument: <code class="literal">IN</code> or <code class="literal">VARIADIC</code>.

Do not write argument types there, however — the argument types of the support functions are determined from other parameters.</p> <p>Ordinarily, PostgreSQL functions are expected to be true functions that do not modify their input values. However, an aggregate transition function, <span class="emphasis"><em>when used in the context of an aggregate</em></span>, is allowed to cheat and modify its transition-state argument in place. This can provide substantial performance benefits compared to making a fresh copy of the transition state each time.</p> <p>Likewise, while an aggregate final function is normally expected not to modify its input values, sometimes it is impractical to avoid modifying the transition-state argument. Such behavior must be declared using the <code class="literal">FINALFUNC_MODIFY</code> parameter. The <code class="literal">READ_WRITE</code> value indicates that the final function modifies the transition state in unspecified ways. This value prevents use of the aggregate as a window function, and it also prevents merging of transition states for aggregate calls that share the same input values and transition functions. The <code class="literal">SHAREABLE</code> value indicates that the transition function cannot be applied after the final function, but multiple final-function calls can be performed on the ending transition state value. This value prevents use of the aggregate as a window function, but it allows merging of transition states. (That is, the optimization of interest here is not applying the same final function repeatedly, but applying different final functions to the same ending transition state value. This is allowed as long as none of the final functions are marked <code class="literal">READ_WRITE</code>.)</p> <p>If an aggregate supports moving-aggregate mode, it will improve calculation efficiency when the aggregate is used as a window function for a window with moving frame start (that is, a frame start mode other than <code class="literal">UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</code>). Conceptually, the forward transition function adds input values to the aggregate's state when they enter the window frame from the bottom, and the inverse transition function removes them again when they leave the frame at the top. So, when values are removed, they are always removed in the same order they were added. Whenever the inverse transition function is invoked, it will thus receive the earliest added but not yet removed argument value(s). The inverse transition function can assume that at least one row will remain in the current state after it removes the oldest row. (When this would not be the case, the window function mechanism simply starts a fresh aggregation, rather than using the inverse transition function.)</p> <p>The forward transition function for moving-aggregate mode is not allowed to return NULL as the new state value. If the inverse transition function returns NULL, this is taken as an indication that the inverse function cannot reverse the state calculation for this particular input, and so the aggregate calculation will be redone from scratch for the current frame starting position. This convention allows moving-aggregate mode to be used in situations where there are some infrequent cases that are impractical to reverse out of the running state value.</p> <p>If no moving-aggregate implementation is supplied, the aggregate can still be used with moving frames, but PostgreSQL will recompute the whole aggregation whenever the start of the frame moves. Note that whether or not the aggregate supports moving-aggregate mode, PostgreSQL can handle a moving frame end without recalculation; this is done by continuing to add new values to the aggregate's state. This is why use of an aggregate as a window function requires that the final function be read-only: it must not damage the aggregate's state value, so that the aggregation can be continued even after an aggregate result value has been obtained for one set of frame boundaries.</p> <p>The syntax for ordered-set aggregates allows <code class="literal">VARIADIC</code> to be specified for both the last direct parameter and the last aggregated (<code class="literal">WITHIN GROUP</code>) parameter. However, the current implementation restricts use of <code class="literal">VARIADIC</code> in two ways. First, ordered-set aggregates can only use <code class="literal">VARIADIC "any"</code>, not other variadic array types. Second, if the last direct parameter is <code class="literal">VARIADIC "any"</code>, then there can be only one aggregated parameter and it must also be <code class="literal">VARIADIC "any"</code>. (In the representation used in the system catalogs, these two parameters are merged into a single <code class="literal">VARIADIC "any"</code> item, since <code class="structname">pg_proc</code> cannot represent functions with more than one <code class="literal">VARIADIC</code> parameter.) If the aggregate is a hypothetical-set aggregate, the direct arguments that match the <code class="literal">VARIADIC "any"</code> parameter are the hypothetical ones; any preceding parameters represent additional direct arguments that are not constrained to match the aggregated arguments.</p> <p>Currently, ordered-set aggregates do not need to support moving-aggregate mode, since they cannot be used as window functions.</p> <p>Partial (including parallel) aggregation is currently not supported for ordered-set aggregates. Also, it will never be used for aggregate calls that include <code class="literal">DISTINCT</code> or <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code> clauses, since those semantics cannot be supported during partial aggregation.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.57.8"> <h2>Examples</h2> <p>See <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/xaggr.html" title="38.12. User-Defined Aggregates">Section 38.12</a>.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.57.9"> <h2>Compatibility</h2> <p><code class="command">CREATE AGGREGATE</code> is a PostgreSQL language extension.
