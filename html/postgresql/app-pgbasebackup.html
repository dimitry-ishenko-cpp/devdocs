<h1>pg_basebackup</h1> <p>pg_basebackup — take a base backup of a PostgreSQL cluster</p>   <h2>Synopsis</h2> <div class="cmdsynopsis"> <p id="id-1.9.4.10.4.1"><code class="command">pg_basebackup</code> [<code>option</code>...]</p> </div>  <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.4.10.5"> <h2>Description</h2> <p>pg_basebackup is used to take a base backup of a running PostgreSQL database cluster. The backup is taken without affecting other clients of the database, and can be used both for point-in-time recovery (see <a class="xref" href="continuous-archiving.html" title="25.3. Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)">Section 25.3</a>) and as the starting point for a log-shipping or streaming-replication standby server (see <a class="xref" href="warm-standby.html" title="26.2. Log-Shipping Standby Servers">Section 26.2</a>).</p> <p>pg_basebackup can take a full or incremental base backup of the database. When used to take a full backup, it makes an exact copy of the database cluster's files. When used to take an incremental backup, some files that would have been part of a full backup may be replaced with incremental versions of the same files, containing only those blocks that have been modified since the reference backup. An incremental backup cannot be used directly; instead, <a class="xref" href="app-pgcombinebackup.html" title="pg_combinebackup">pg_combinebackup</a> must first be used to combine it with the previous backups upon which it depends. See <a class="xref" href="continuous-archiving.html#BACKUP-INCREMENTAL-BACKUP" title="25.3.3. Making an Incremental Backup">Section 25.3.3</a> for more information about incremental backups, and <a class="xref" href="continuous-archiving.html#BACKUP-PITR-RECOVERY" title="25.3.5. Recovering Using a Continuous Archive Backup">Section 25.3.5</a> for steps to recover from a backup.</p> <p>In any mode, pg_basebackup makes sure the server is put into and out of backup mode automatically. Backups are always taken of the entire database cluster; it is not possible to back up individual databases or database objects. For selective backups, another tool such as <a class="xref" href="app-pgdump.html" title="pg_dump">pg_dump</a> must be used.</p> <p>The backup is made over a regular PostgreSQL connection that uses the replication protocol. The connection must be made with a user ID that has <code class="literal">REPLICATION</code> permissions (see <a class="xref" href="role-attributes.html" title="21.2. Role Attributes">Section 21.2</a>) or is a superuser, and <a class="link" href="auth-pg-hba-conf.html" title="20.1. The pg_hba.conf File"><code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code></a> must permit the replication connection. The server must also be configured with <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-MAX-WAL-SENDERS">max_wal_senders</a> set high enough to provide at least one walsender for the backup plus one for WAL streaming (if used).</p> <p>There can be multiple <code class="command">pg_basebackup</code>s running at the same time, but it is usually better from a performance point of view to take only one backup, and copy the result.</p> <p>pg_basebackup can make a base backup from not only a primary server but also a standby. To take a backup from a standby, set up the standby so that it can accept replication connections (that is, set <code class="varname">max_wal_senders</code> and <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-HOT-STANDBY">hot_standby</a>, and configure its <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> appropriately). You will also need to enable <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FULL-PAGE-WRITES">full_page_writes</a> on the primary.</p> <p>Note that there are some limitations in taking a backup from a standby:</p>  <ul> <li> <p>The backup history file is not created in the database cluster backed up.</p> </li> <li> <p>pg_basebackup cannot force the standby to switch to a new WAL file at the end of backup. When you are using <code class="literal">-X none</code>, if write activity on the primary is low, pg_basebackup may need to wait a long time for the last WAL file required for the backup to be switched and archived. In this case, it may be useful to run <code class="function">pg_switch_wal</code> on the primary in order to trigger an immediate WAL file switch.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the standby is promoted to be primary during backup, the backup fails.</p> </li> <li> <p>All WAL records required for the backup must contain sufficient full-page writes, which requires you to enable <code class="varname">full_page_writes</code> on the primary.</p> </li> </ul>  <p>Whenever pg_basebackup is taking a base backup, the server's <code class="structname">pg_stat_progress_basebackup</code> view will report the progress of the backup. See <a class="xref" href="progress-reporting.html#BASEBACKUP-PROGRESS-REPORTING" title="27.4.6. Base Backup Progress Reporting">Section 27.4.6</a> for details.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.4.10.6"> <h2>Options</h2> <p>The following command-line options control the location and format of the output:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt>

If it already exists, it must be empty.</p> <p>When the backup is in tar format, the target directory may be specified as <code class="literal">-</code> (dash), causing the tar file to be written to <code class="literal">stdout</code>.</p> <p>This option is required.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-F format</code><code class="option">--format=format</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Selects the format for the output. <code>format</code> can be one of the following:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt>
<code class="literal">p</code><code class="literal">plain</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Write the output as plain files, with the same layout as the source server's data directory and tablespaces. When the cluster has no additional tablespaces, the whole database will be placed in the target directory. If the cluster contains additional tablespaces, the main data directory will be placed in the target directory, but all other tablespaces will be placed in the same absolute path as they have on the source server. (See <code class="option">--tablespace-mapping</code> to change that.)</p> <p>This is the default format.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">t</code><code class="literal">tar</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Write the output as tar files in the target directory. The main data directory's contents will be written to a file named <code class="filename">base.tar</code>, and each other tablespace will be written to a separate tar file named after that tablespace's OID.</p> <p>If the target directory is specified as <code class="literal">-</code> (dash), the tar contents will be written to standard output, suitable for piping to (for example) gzip. This is only allowed if the cluster has no additional tablespaces and WAL streaming is not used.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </dd> <dt>

This eases setting up a standby server using the results of the backup.</p> <p>The <code class="filename">postgresql.auto.conf</code> file will record the connection settings and, if specified, the replication slot that pg_basebackup is using, so that streaming replication and <a class="link" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/logicaldecoding-explanation.html#LOGICALDECODING-REPLICATION-SLOTS-SYNCHRONIZATION" title="47.2.3. Replication Slot Synchronization">logical replication slot synchronization</a> will use the same settings later on.

<code class="option">-t target</code><code class="option">--target=target</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Instructs the server where to place the base backup. The default target is <code class="literal">client</code>, which specifies that the backup should be sent to the machine where pg_basebackup is running. If the target is instead set to <code class="literal">server:/some/path</code>, the backup will be stored on the machine where the server is running in the <code class="literal">/some/path</code> directory. Storing a backup on the server requires superuser privileges or having privileges of the <code class="literal">pg_write_server_files</code> role. If the target is set to <code class="literal">blackhole</code>, the contents are discarded and not stored anywhere. This should only be used for testing purposes, as you will not end up with an actual backup.</p> <p>Since WAL streaming is implemented by pg_basebackup rather than by the server, this option cannot be used together with <code class="literal">-Xstream</code>. Since that is the default, when this option is specified, you must also specify either <code class="literal">-Xfetch</code> or <code class="literal">-Xnone</code>.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-T olddir=newdir</code><code class="option">--tablespace-mapping=olddir=newdir</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Relocates the tablespace in directory <code>olddir</code> to <code>newdir</code> during the backup. To be effective, <code>olddir</code> must exactly match the path specification of the tablespace as it is defined on the source server. (But it is not an error if there is no tablespace in <code>olddir</code> on the source server.) Meanwhile <code>newdir</code> is a directory in the receiving host's filesystem. As with the main target directory, <code>newdir</code> need not exist already, but if it does exist it must be empty. Both <code>olddir</code> and <code>newdir</code> must be absolute paths. If either path needs to contain an equal sign (<code class="literal">=</code>), precede that with a backslash. This option can be specified multiple times for multiple tablespaces.</p> <p>If a tablespace is relocated in this way, the symbolic links inside the main data directory are updated to point to the new location. So the new data directory is ready to be used for a new server instance with all tablespaces in the updated locations.</p> <p>Currently, this option only works with plain output format; it is ignored if tar format is selected.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="option">--waldir=waldir</code></dt> <dd> <p>Sets the directory to write WAL (write-ahead log) files to. By default WAL files will be placed in the <code class="filename">pg_wal</code> subdirectory of the target directory, but this option can be used to place them elsewhere. <code>waldir</code> must be an absolute path. As with the main target directory, <code>waldir</code> need not exist already, but if it does exist it must be empty. This option can only be specified when the backup is in plain format.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-X method</code><code class="option">--wal-method=method</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Includes the required WAL (write-ahead log) files in the backup. This will include all write-ahead logs generated during the backup. Unless the method <code class="literal">none</code> is specified, it is possible to start a postmaster in the target directory without the need to consult the WAL archive, thus making the output a completely standalone backup.</p> <p>The following <code>method</code>s for collecting the write-ahead logs are supported:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt>
<code class="literal">n</code><code class="literal">none</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Don't include write-ahead logs in the backup.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">f</code><code class="literal">fetch</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>The write-ahead log files are collected at the end of the backup. Therefore, it is necessary for the source server's <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-WAL-KEEP-SIZE">wal_keep_size</a> parameter to be set high enough that the required log data is not removed before the end of the backup. If the required log data has been recycled before it's time to transfer it, the backup will fail and be unusable.</p> <p>When tar format is used, the write-ahead log files will be included in the <code class="filename">base.tar</code> file.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="literal">s</code><code class="literal">stream</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Stream write-ahead log data while the backup is being taken. This method will open a second connection to the server and start streaming the write-ahead log in parallel while running the backup. Therefore, it will require two replication connections not just one. As long as the client can keep up with the write-ahead log data, using this method requires no extra write-ahead logs to be saved on the source server.</p> <p>When tar format is used, the write-ahead log files will be written to a separate file named <code class="filename">pg_wal.tar</code> (if the server is a version earlier than 10, the file will be named <code class="filename">pg_xlog.tar</code>).</p> <p>This value is the default.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-z</code><code class="option">--gzip</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Enables gzip compression of tar file output, with the default compression level. Compression is only available when using the tar format, and the suffix <code class="filename">.gz</code> will automatically be added to all tar filenames.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-Z level</code><code class="option">-Z [{client|server}-]method[:detail]</code><code class="option">--compress=level</code><code class="option">--compress=[{client|server}-]method[:detail]</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Requests compression of the backup. If <code class="literal">client</code> or <code class="literal">server</code> is included, it specifies where the compression is to be performed. Compressing on the server will reduce transfer bandwidth but will increase server CPU consumption. The default is <code class="literal">client</code> except when <code class="literal">--target</code> is used. In that case, the backup is not being sent to the client, so only server compression is sensible. When <code class="literal">-Xstream</code>, which is the default, is used, server-side compression will not be applied to the WAL. To compress the WAL, use client-side compression, or specify <code class="literal">-Xfetch</code>.</p> <p>The compression method can be set to <code class="literal">gzip</code>, <code class="literal">lz4</code>, <code class="literal">zstd</code>, <code class="literal">none</code> for no compression or an integer (no compression if 0, <code class="literal">gzip</code> if greater than 0). A compression detail string can optionally be specified. If the detail string is an integer, it specifies the compression level. Otherwise, it should be a comma-separated list of items, each of the form <code>keyword</code> or <code>keyword=value</code>. Currently, the supported keywords are <code class="literal">level</code>, <code class="literal">long</code>, and <code class="literal">workers</code>. The detail string cannot be used when the compression method is specified as a plain integer.</p> <p>If no compression level is specified, the default compression level will be used. If only a level is specified without mentioning an algorithm, <code class="literal">gzip</code> compression will be used if the level is greater than 0, and no compression will be used if the level is 0.</p> <p>When the tar format is used with <code class="literal">gzip</code>, <code class="literal">lz4</code>, or <code class="literal">zstd</code>, the suffix <code class="filename">.gz</code>, <code class="filename">.lz4</code>, or <code class="filename">.zst</code>, respectively, will be automatically added to all tar filenames. When the plain format is used, client-side compression may not be specified, but it is still possible to request server-side compression. If this is done, the server will compress the backup for transmission, and the client will decompress and extract it.</p> <p>When this option is used in combination with <code class="literal">-Xstream</code>, <code class="literal">pg_wal.tar</code> will be compressed using <code class="literal">gzip</code> if client-side gzip compression is selected, but will not be compressed if any other compression algorithm is selected, or if server-side compression is selected.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>The following command-line options control the generation of the backup and the invocation of the program:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt>
<code class="option">-c {fast|spread}</code><code class="option">--checkpoint={fast|spread}</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Sets checkpoint mode to fast (immediate) or spread (the default) (see <a class="xref" href="continuous-archiving.html#BACKUP-LOWLEVEL-BASE-BACKUP" title="25.3.4. Making a Base Backup Using the Low Level API">Section 25.3.4</a>).</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-C</code><code class="option">--create-slot</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Specifies that the replication slot named by the <code class="literal">--slot</code> option should be created before starting the backup. An error is raised if the slot already exists.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-l label</code><code class="option">--label=label</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Sets the label for the backup. If none is specified, a default value of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">pg_basebackup base backup</code></span>”</span> will be used.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-n</code><code class="option">--no-clean</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>By default, when <code class="command">pg_basebackup</code> aborts with an error, it removes any directories it might have created before discovering that it cannot finish the job (for example, the target directory and write-ahead log directory). This option inhibits tidying-up and is thus useful for debugging.</p> <p>Note that tablespace directories are not cleaned up either way.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-N</code><code class="option">--no-sync</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>By default, <code class="command">pg_basebackup</code> will wait for all files to be written safely to disk. This option causes <code class="command">pg_basebackup</code> to return without waiting, which is faster, but means that a subsequent operating system crash can leave the base backup corrupt. Generally, this option is useful for testing but should not be used when creating a production installation.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-P</code><code class="option">--progress</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Enables progress reporting. Turning this on will deliver an approximate progress report during the backup. Since the database may change during the backup, this is only an approximation and may not end at exactly <code class="literal">100%</code>. In particular, when WAL log is included in the backup, the total amount of data cannot be estimated in advance, and in this case the estimated target size will increase once it passes the total estimate without WAL.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-r rate</code><code class="option">--max-rate=rate</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Sets the maximum transfer rate at which data is collected from the source server. This can be useful to limit the impact of pg_basebackup on the server. Values are in kilobytes per second. Use a suffix of <code class="literal">M</code> to indicate megabytes per second. A suffix of <code class="literal">k</code> is also accepted, and has no effect. Valid values are between 32 kilobytes per second and 1024 megabytes per second.</p> <p>This option always affects transfer of the data directory. Transfer of WAL files is only affected if the collection method is <code class="literal">fetch</code>.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-S slotname</code><code class="option">--slot=slotname</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>This option can only be used together with <code class="literal">-X stream</code>. It causes WAL streaming to use the specified replication slot. If the base backup is intended to be used as a streaming-replication standby using a replication slot, the standby should then use the same replication slot name as <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-PRIMARY-SLOT-NAME">primary_slot_name</a>. This ensures that the primary server does not remove any necessary WAL data in the time between the end of the base backup and the start of streaming replication on the new standby.</p> <p>The specified replication slot has to exist unless the option <code class="option">-C</code> is also used.</p> <p>If this option is not specified and the server supports temporary replication slots (version 10 and later), then a temporary replication slot is automatically used for WAL streaming.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="option">--sync-method=method</code></dt> <dd> <p>When set to <code class="literal">fsync</code>, which is the default, <code class="command">pg_basebackup</code> will recursively open and synchronize all files in the backup directory. When the plain format is used, the search for files will follow symbolic links for the WAL directory and each configured tablespace.</p> <p>On Linux, <code class="literal">syncfs</code> may be used instead to ask the operating system to synchronize the whole file system that contains the backup directory. When the plain format is used, <code class="command">pg_basebackup</code> will also synchronize the file systems that contain the WAL files and each tablespace. See <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-error-handling.html#GUC-RECOVERY-INIT-SYNC-METHOD">recovery_init_sync_method</a> for information about the caveats to be aware of when using <code class="literal">syncfs</code>.</p> <p>This option has no effect when <code class="option">--no-sync</code> is used.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-v</code><code class="option">--verbose</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Enables verbose mode. Will output some extra steps during startup and shutdown, as well as show the exact file name that is currently being processed if progress reporting is also enabled.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="option">--manifest-checksums=algorithm</code></dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the checksum algorithm that should be applied to each file included in the backup manifest. Currently, the available algorithms are <code class="literal">NONE</code>, <code class="literal">CRC32C</code>, <code class="literal">SHA224</code>, <code class="literal">SHA256</code>, <code class="literal">SHA384</code>, and <code class="literal">SHA512</code>. The default is <code class="literal">CRC32C</code>.</p> <p>If <code class="literal">NONE</code> is selected, the backup manifest will not contain any checksums. Otherwise, it will contain a checksum of each file in the backup using the specified algorithm. In addition, the manifest will always contain a <code class="literal">SHA256</code> checksum of its own contents. The <code class="literal">SHA</code> algorithms are significantly more CPU-intensive than <code class="literal">CRC32C</code>, so selecting one of them may increase the time required to complete the backup.</p> <p>Using a SHA hash function provides a cryptographically secure digest of each file for users who wish to verify that the backup has not been tampered with, while the CRC32C algorithm provides a checksum that is much faster to calculate; it is good at catching errors due to accidental changes but is not resistant to malicious modifications. Note that, to be useful against an adversary who has access to the backup, the backup manifest would need to be stored securely elsewhere or otherwise verified not to have been modified since the backup was taken.</p> <p><a class="xref" href="app-pgverifybackup.html" title="pg_verifybackup">pg_verifybackup</a> can be used to check the integrity of a backup against the backup manifest.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="option">--manifest-force-encode</code></dt> <dd> <p>Forces all filenames in the backup manifest to be hex-encoded.

This option is mostly intended to test that tools which read a backup manifest file properly handle this case.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="option">--no-estimate-size</code></dt> <dd> <p>Prevents the server from estimating the total amount of backup data that will be streamed, resulting in the <code class="structfield">backup_total</code> column in the <code class="structname">pg_stat_progress_basebackup</code> view always being <code class="literal">NULL</code>.</p> <p>Without this option, the backup will start by enumerating the size of the entire database, and then go back and send the actual contents. This may make the backup take slightly longer, and in particular it will take longer before the first data is sent. This option is useful to avoid such estimation time if it's too long.</p> <p>This option is not allowed when using <code class="option">--progress</code>.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="option">--no-manifest</code></dt> <dd> <p>Disables generation of a backup manifest. If this option is not specified, the server will generate and send a backup manifest which can be verified using <a class="xref" href="app-pgverifybackup.html" title="pg_verifybackup">pg_verifybackup</a>. The manifest is a list of every file present in the backup with the exception of any WAL files that may be included. It also stores the size, last modification time, and an optional checksum for each file.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="option">--no-slot</code></dt> <dd> <p>Prevents the creation of a temporary replication slot for the backup.</p> <p>By default, if log streaming is selected but no slot name is given with the <code class="option">-S</code> option, then a temporary replication slot is created (if supported by the source server).</p> <p>The main purpose of this option is to allow taking a base backup when the server has no free replication slots. Using a replication slot is almost always preferred, because it prevents needed WAL from being removed by the server during the backup.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="option">--no-verify-checksums</code></dt> <dd> <p>Disables verification of checksums, if they are enabled on the server the base backup is taken from.</p> <p>By default, checksums are verified and checksum failures will result in a non-zero exit status. However, the base backup will not be removed in such a case, as if the <code class="option">--no-clean</code> option had been used.

However, a database name supplied that way overrides the default database name (<code class="literal">replication</code>) for purposes of looking up the replication connection's password in <code class="filename">~/.pgpass</code>. Similarly, middleware or proxies used in connecting to PostgreSQL might utilize the name for purposes such as connection routing.

</dt> <dd> <p>Forces pg_basebackup to prompt for a password before connecting to the source server.</p> <p>This option is never essential, since pg_basebackup will automatically prompt for a password if the server demands password authentication. However, pg_basebackup will waste a connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password. In some cases it is worth typing <code class="option">-W</code> to avoid the extra connection attempt.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Other options are also available:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt>
<code class="option">-V</code><code class="option">--version</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Prints the pg_basebackup version and exits.</p> </dd> <dt>
<code class="option">-?</code><code class="option">--help</code>

Possible values are <code class="literal">always</code>, <code class="literal">auto</code> and <code class="literal">never</code>.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.4.10.8"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>At the beginning of the backup, a checkpoint needs to be performed on the source server. This can take some time (especially if the option <code class="literal">--checkpoint=fast</code> is not used), during which pg_basebackup will appear to be idle.</p> <p>The backup will include all files in the data directory and tablespaces, including the configuration files and any additional files placed in the directory by third parties, except certain temporary files managed by PostgreSQL and operating system files. But only regular files and directories are copied, except that symbolic links used for tablespaces are preserved. Symbolic links pointing to certain directories known to PostgreSQL are copied as empty directories. Other symbolic links and special device files are skipped. See <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/protocol-replication.html" title="53.4. Streaming Replication Protocol">Section 53.4</a> for the precise details.</p> <p>In plain format, tablespaces will be backed up to the same path they have on the source server, unless the option <code class="literal">--tablespace-mapping</code> is used. Without this option, running a plain format base backup on the same host as the server will not work if tablespaces are in use, because the backup would have to be written to the same directory locations as the original tablespaces.</p> <p>When tar format is used, it is the user's responsibility to unpack each tar file before starting a PostgreSQL server that uses the data. If there are additional tablespaces, the tar files for them need to be unpacked in the correct locations. In this case the symbolic links for those tablespaces will be created by the server according to the contents of the <code class="filename">tablespace_map</code> file that is included in the <code class="filename">base.tar</code> file.</p> <p>pg_basebackup works with servers of the same or an older major version, down to 9.1. However, WAL streaming mode (<code class="literal">-X stream</code>) only works with server version 9.3 and later, and tar format (<code class="literal">--format=tar</code>) only works with server version 9.5 and later.</p> <p>pg_basebackup will preserve group permissions for data files if group permissions are enabled on the source cluster.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.4.10.9"> <h2>Examples</h2> <p>To create a base backup of the server at <code class="literal">mydbserver</code> and store it in the local directory <code class="filename">/usr/local/pgsql/data</code>:</p> <pre>
$ <strong class="userinput">pg_basebackup -h mydbserver -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</strong>
</pre> <p>To create a backup of the local server with one compressed tar file for each tablespace, and store it in the directory <code class="filename">backup</code>, showing a progress report while running:</p> <pre>
$ <strong class="userinput">pg_basebackup -D backup -Ft -z -P</strong>
</pre> <p>To create a backup of a single-tablespace local database and compress this with bzip2:</p> <pre>
$ <strong class="userinput">pg_basebackup -D - -Ft -X fetch | bzip2 &gt; backup.tar.bz2</strong>
</pre> <p>(This command will fail if there are multiple tablespaces in the database.)</p> <p>To create a backup of a local database where the tablespace in <code class="filename">/opt/ts</code> is relocated to <code class="filename">./backup/ts</code>:</p> <pre>
$ <strong class="userinput">pg_basebackup -D backup/data -T /opt/ts=$(pwd)/backup/ts</strong>
</pre> <p>To create a backup of the local server with one tar file for each tablespace compressed with gzip at level 9, stored in the directory <code class="filename">backup</code>:</p> <pre>
$ <strong class="userinput">pg_basebackup -D backup -Ft --compress=gzip:9</strong>
