<h1>6.2. Updating Data </h1>    <p>The modification of data that is already in the database is referred to as updating. You can update individual rows, all the rows in a table, or a subset of all rows. Each column can be updated separately; the other columns are not affected.</p> <p>To update existing rows, use the <a class="xref" href="sql-update.html" title="UPDATE">UPDATE</a> command. This requires three pieces of information:</p> <div class="orderedlist"> <ol class="orderedlist compact" type="1"> <li> <p>The name of the table and column to update</p> </li> <li> <p>The new value of the column</p> </li> <li> <p>Which row(s) to update</p> </li> </ol> </div> <p>Recall from <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/ddl.html" title="Chapter 5. Data Definition">Chapter 5</a> that SQL does not, in general, provide a unique identifier for rows. Therefore it is not always possible to directly specify which row to update. Instead, you specify which conditions a row must meet in order to be updated. Only if you have a primary key in the table (independent of whether you declared it or not) can you reliably address individual rows by choosing a condition that matches the primary key. Graphical database access tools rely on this fact to allow you to update rows individually.</p> <p>For example, this command updates all products that have a price of 5 to have a price of 10:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
UPDATE products SET price = 10 WHERE price = 5;
</pre> <p>This might cause zero, one, or many rows to be updated. It is not an error to attempt an update that does not match any rows.</p> <p>Let's look at that command in detail. First is the key word <code class="literal">UPDATE</code> followed by the table name. As usual, the table name can be schema-qualified, otherwise it is looked up in the path. Next is the key word <code class="literal">SET</code> followed by the column name, an equal sign, and the new column value. The new column value can be any scalar expression, not just a constant. For example, if you want to raise the price of all products by 10% you could use:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.10;
</pre> <p>As you see, the expression for the new value can refer to the existing value(s) in the row. We also left out the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause. If it is omitted, it means that all rows in the table are updated. If it is present, only those rows that match the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition are updated. Note that the equals sign in the <code class="literal">SET</code> clause is an assignment while the one in the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause is a comparison, but this does not create any ambiguity. Of course, the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition does not have to be an equality test. Many other operators are available (see <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions.html" title="Chapter 9. Functions and Operators">Chapter 9</a>). But the expression needs to evaluate to a Boolean result.</p> <p>You can update more than one column in an <code class="command">UPDATE</code> command by listing more than one assignment in the <code class="literal">SET</code> clause. For example:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
UPDATE mytable SET a = 5, b = 3, c = 1 WHERE a &gt; 0;
