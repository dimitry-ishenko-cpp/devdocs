    <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">No Diagnostic Required</h1>            <p>"No diagnostic required" indicates that some phraseology is ill-formed according to the language rules, but a compiler need not issue any diagnostic or error message. Usually, the reason is that trying to detect these situations would result in prohibitively long compile times.</p>
