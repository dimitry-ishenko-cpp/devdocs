    <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Basic concepts</h1>            <p>This section provides definitions for the specific terminology and the concepts used when describing the C++ programming language.</p>
<p>A C++ program is a sequence of text files (typically header and source files) that contain <a href="declarations.html" title="cpp/language/declarations">declarations</a>. They undergo <a href="translation_phases.html" title="cpp/language/translation phases">translation</a> to become an executable program, which is executed when the C++ implementation calls its <a href="main_function.html" title="cpp/language/main function">main function</a>.</p>
<p>Certain words in a C++ program have special meaning, and these are known as <a href="../keyword.html" title="cpp/keyword">keywords</a>. Others can be used as <a href="identifiers.html" title="cpp/language/identifiers">identifiers</a>. <a href="../comment.html" title="cpp/comment">Comments</a> are ignored during translation. C++ programs also contain <a href="expressions.html#Literals" title="cpp/language/expressions">literals</a>, the values of characters inside them are determined by <a href="charset.html" title="cpp/language/charset">character sets and encodings</a>. Certain characters in the program have to be represented with <a href="escape.html" title="cpp/language/escape">escape sequences</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>entities</i> of a C++ program are values, <a href="objects.html" title="cpp/language/objects" class="mw-redirect">objects</a>, <a href="reference.html" title="cpp/language/reference">references</a><span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx17"><span>, <a href="structured_binding.html" title="cpp/language/structured binding">structured bindings</a></span><span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx17">(since C++17)</span></span></span>, <a href="functions.html" title="cpp/language/functions">functions</a>, <a href="enum.html" title="cpp/language/enum">enumerators</a>, <a href="type.html" title="cpp/language/type">types</a>, class members, <a href="templates.html" title="cpp/language/templates">templates</a>, <a href="template_specialization.html" title="cpp/language/template specialization">template specializations</a><span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx11"><span>, <a href="parameter_pack.html" title="cpp/language/parameter pack">parameter packs</a></span><span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx11">(since C++11)</span></span></span>, and <a href="namespace.html" title="cpp/language/namespace">namespaces</a>. Preprocessor <a href="../preprocessor/replace.html" title="cpp/preprocessor/replace">macros</a> are not C++ entities.</p>
<p><i><a href="declarations.html" title="cpp/language/declarations">Declarations</a></i> may introduce entities, associate them with <a href="name.html" title="cpp/language/name" class="mw-redirect">names</a> and define their properties. The declarations that define all properties required to use an entity are <a href="definition.html" title="cpp/language/definition">definitions</a>. A program must contain only one definition of any non-inline function or variable that is <a href="definition.html#ODR-use" title="cpp/language/definition">odr-used</a>.</p>
<p>Definitions of functions usually include sequences of <a href="statements.html" title="cpp/language/statements">statements</a>, some of which include <a href="expressions.html" title="cpp/language/expressions">expressions</a>, which specify the computations to be performed by the program.</p>
<p>Names encountered in a program are associated with the declarations that introduced them using <a href="lookup.html" title="cpp/language/lookup">name lookup</a>. Each name is only valid within a part of the program called its <a href="scope.html" title="cpp/language/scope">scope</a>. Some names have <a href="storage_duration.html" title="cpp/language/storage duration">linkage</a> which makes them refer to the same entities when they appear in different scopes or translation units.</p>
<p>Each object, reference, function, expression in C++ is associated with a <a href="type.html" title="cpp/language/type">type</a>, which may be <a href="types.html" title="cpp/language/types">fundamental</a>, compound, or <a href="classes.html" title="cpp/language/classes">user-defined</a>, complete or <a href="incomplete_type.html" title="cpp/language/incomplete type" class="mw-redirect">incomplete</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Declared objects and declared references that are not <a href="data_members.html" title="cpp/language/data members">non-static data members</a> are <i>variables</i>.</p>
