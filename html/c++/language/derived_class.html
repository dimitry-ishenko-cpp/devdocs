<h3 id="Public_inheritance"> Public inheritance</h3> <p>When a class uses <code>public</code> <a href="access.html" title="cpp/language/access">member access specifier</a> to derive from a base, all public members of the base class are accessible as public members of the derived class and all protected members of the base class are accessible as protected members of the derived class (private members of the base are never accessible unless friended).</p>
<p>Public inheritance models the subtyping relationship of object-oriented programming: the derived class object IS-A base class object. References and pointers to a derived object are expected to be usable by any code that expects references or pointers to any of its public bases (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle" class="extiw" title="enwiki:Liskov substitution principle">LSP</a>) or, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract" class="extiw" title="enwiki:Design by contract">DbC</a> terms, a derived class should maintain class invariants of its public bases, should not strengthen any precondition or weaken any postcondition of a member function it <a href="virtual.html" title="cpp/language/virtual">overrides</a>.</p>

<p>Protected inheritance may be used for "controlled polymorphism": within the members of Derived, as well as within the members of all further-derived classes, the derived class IS-A base: references and pointers to Derived may be used where references and pointers to Base are expected.</p>
<h3 id="Private_inheritance"> Private inheritance</h3> <p>When a class uses <code>private</code> <a href="access.html" title="cpp/language/access">member access specifier</a> to derive from a base, all public and protected members of the base class are accessible as private members of the derived class (private members of the base are never accessible unless friended).</p>
<p>Private inheritance is commonly used in policy-based design, since policies are usually empty classes, and using them as bases both enables static polymorphism and leverages <a href="ebo.html" title="cpp/language/ebo">empty-base optimization</a>.</p>
<p>Private inheritance can also be used to implement the composition relationship (the base class subobject is an implementation detail of the derived class object). Using a member offers better encapsulation and is generally preferred unless the derived class requires access to protected members (including constructors) of the base, needs to override a virtual member of the base, needs the base to be constructed before and destructed after some other base subobject, needs to share a virtual base or needs to control the construction of a virtual base. Use of members to implement composition is also not applicable in the case of multiple inheritance from a <a href="parameter_pack.html" title="cpp/language/parameter pack">parameter pack</a> or when the identities of the base classes are determined at compile time through template metaprogramming.</p>
<p>Similar to protected inheritance, private inheritance may also be used for controlled polymorphism: within the members of the derived (but not within further-derived classes), derived IS-A base.</p>
