<h3 id="Notes"> Notes</h3> <p>On x86 (including x86-64), <code>atomic_thread_fence</code> functions issue no CPU instructions and only affect compile-time code motion, except for <code>std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order::seq_cst)</code>.</p>
<p><code>atomic_thread_fence</code> imposes stronger synchronization constraints than an atomic store operation with the same <code><a href="memory_order.html" title="cpp/atomic/memory order">std::memory_order</a></code>. While an atomic store-release operation prevents all preceding reads and writes from moving past the store-release, an <code>atomic_thread_fence</code> with <code>memory_order_release</code> ordering prevents all preceding reads and writes from moving past all subsequent stores.</p>
<p>Fence-fence synchronization can be used to add synchronization to a sequence of several relaxed atomic operations, for example:</p>

    std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);
//  v0, v1, v2 might turn out to be -1, some or all of them.
//  Otherwise it is safe to read the non-atomic data because of the fences:
