    <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Comments</h1>            <p>Comments serve as a sort of in-code documentation. When inserted into a program, they are effectively ignored by the compiler; they are solely intended to be used as notes by the humans that read source code. Although specific documentation is not part of the C++ standard, several utilities exist that parse comments with different documentation formats.</p>

<span class="t-li">2)</span> Often known as "C++-style" or "single-line" comments.</div> <p>All comments are removed from the program at <a href="language/translation_phases.html" title="cpp/language/translation phases">translation phase 3</a> by replacing each comment with a single whitespace character.</p>
<h3 id="C-style"> C-style</h3> <p>C-style comments are usually used to comment large blocks of text, however, they can be used to comment single lines. To insert a C-style comment, simply surround text with <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>; this will cause the contents of the comment to be ignored by the compiler. Although it is not part of the C++ standard, <code>/**</code> and <code>*/</code> are often used to indicate documentation blocks; this is legal because the second asterisk is simply treated as part of the comment. C-style comments cannot be nested.</p>
<h3 id="C.2B.2B-style"> C++-style</h3> <p>C++-style comments are usually used to comment single lines, however, multiple C++-style comments can be placed together to form multi-line comments. C++-style comments tell the compiler to ignore all content between <code>//</code> and a new line.</p>
<h3 id="Notes"> Notes</h3> <p>Because comments <a href="language/translation_phases.html" title="cpp/language/translation phases">are removed</a> before the preprocessor stage, a macro cannot be used to form a comment and an unterminated C-style comment doesn't spill over from an #include'd file.</p>
<p>Besides commenting out, other mechanisms used for source code exclusion are</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">#if 0
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "this will not be executed or even compiled\n";
#endif</pre></div> <p>and</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">if (false)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "this will not be executed\n";
}</pre></div> <h3 id="Example"> Example</h3> <div class="t-example"> <div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
/* C-style comments can contain
multiple lines */
/* or just one */
 
/**************
 *  you can insert any *, but
 *  you can't make comments nested
 */
 
// C++-style comments can comment one line
 
// or, they can
// be strung together
 
int main()
{
    // comments are removed before preprocessing,
