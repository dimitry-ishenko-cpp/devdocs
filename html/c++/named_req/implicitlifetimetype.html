    <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">C++ named requirements: ImplicitLifetimeType</h1>            <p>Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.</p>
<h3 id="Requirements"> Requirements</h3> <p>The following types are collectively called <i>implicit-lifetime types</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="scalartype.html" title="cpp/named req/ScalarType">scalar types</a> </li>
<li> <a href="../language/classes.html#Implicit-lifetime_class" title="cpp/language/classes">implicit-lifetime class types</a> </li>
<li> array types </li>
<li> cv-qualified versions of these types </li>
</ul> <h3 id="Notes"> Notes</h3> <p>Certain operations may <a href="../language/object.html#Object_creation" title="cpp/language/object">implicitly create</a> and start the <a href="../language/lifetime.html" title="cpp/language/lifetime">lifetime</a> of objects of implicit-lifetime types, if doing so would prevent <a href="../language/ub.html" title="cpp/language/ub">undefined behavior</a>. However, such operations do not start the lifetimes of subobjects of such objects that are not themselves of implicit-lifetime types.</p>
<h3 id="Defect_reports"> Defect reports</h3> <p>The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.</p>
<table class="dsctable"> <tr> <th>DR </th> <th>Applied to </th> <th>Behavior as published </th> <th>Correct behavior </th>
