<h1 id="using-enzyme-with-browserify">Using enzyme with Browserify</h1> <p>If you are using a test runner that runs code in a browser-based environment, you may be using <a href="http://browserify.org/" target="_blank">browserify</a> in order to bundle your React code.</p> <p>Prior to enzyme 3.0 there were some issues with conditional requires that were used to maintain backwards compatibility with React versions. With enzyme 3.0+, this should no longer be an issue. If it is, please file a GitHub issue or make a PR to this documentation with instructions on how to set it up.</p><div class="_attribution">
