<h1 id="prop_test:COST">COST</h1> <p>This property describes the cost of a test. When parallel testing is enabled, tests in the test set will be run in descending order of cost. Projects can explicitly define the cost of a test by setting this property to a floating point value.</p> <p>When the cost of a test is not defined by the project, <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/ctest.1.html#manual:ctest(1)" title="ctest(1)" id="index-0-manual:ctest(1)"><code>ctest</code></a> will initially use a default cost of <code>0</code>. It computes a weighted average of the cost each time a test is run and uses that as an improved estimate of the cost for the next run. The more a test is re-run in the same build directory, the more representative the cost should become.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
