<h1 id="prop_test:FIXTURES_SETUP">FIXTURES_SETUP</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 3.7.</span></p> </div> <p>Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a setup test. These fixture names are distinct from test case names and are not required to have any similarity to the names of tests associated with them.</p> <p>Fixture setup tests are ordinary tests with all of the usual test functionality. Setting the <code>FIXTURES_SETUP</code> property for a test has two primary effects:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>CTest will ensure the test executes before any other test which lists the fixture name(s) in its <a class="reference internal" href="fixtures_required.html#prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED" title="FIXTURES_REQUIRED" id="index-0-prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED"><code>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</code></a> property.</li> <li>If CTest is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular expressions or the <code>--rerun-failed</code> option) and the setup test is not in the set of tests to run, it will automatically be added if any tests in the set require any fixture listed in <code>FIXTURES_SETUP</code>.</li> </ul> <p>A setup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its <code>FIXTURES_SETUP</code> property. It will execute only once for the whole CTest run, not once for each fixture. A fixture can also have more than one setup test defined. If there are multiple setup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with the usual <a class="reference internal" href="depends.html#prop_test:DEPENDS" title="DEPENDS" id="index-0-prop_test:DEPENDS"><code>DEPENDS</code></a> test property if necessary.</p> <p>A setup test is allowed to require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed in its <code>FIXTURES_SETUP</code> property. For example:</p> <pre data-language="cmake"># Ok: dependent fixture is different to setup
set_tests_properties(setupFoo PROPERTIES
  FIXTURES_SETUP    Foo
  FIXTURES_REQUIRED Bar
)

# Error: cannot require same fixture as setup
set_tests_properties(setupFoo PROPERTIES
  FIXTURES_SETUP    Foo
  FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo
)
</pre> <p>If any of a fixture's setup tests fail, none of the tests listing that fixture in its <a class="reference internal" href="fixtures_required.html#prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED" title="FIXTURES_REQUIRED" id="index-1-prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED"><code>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</code></a> property will be run. Cleanup tests will, however, still be executed.</p> <p>See <a class="reference internal" href="fixtures_required.html#prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED" title="FIXTURES_REQUIRED" id="index-2-prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED"><code>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</code></a> for a more complete discussion of how to use test fixtures.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
