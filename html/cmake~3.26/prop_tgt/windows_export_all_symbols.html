<h1 id="prop_tgt:WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS">WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 3.4.</span></p> </div> <p>This property is implemented only for MS-compatible tools on Windows.</p> <p>Enable this boolean property to automatically create a module definition (<code>.def</code>) file with all global symbols found in the input <code>.obj</code> files for a <code>SHARED</code> library (or executable with <a class="reference internal" href="enable_exports.html#prop_tgt:ENABLE_EXPORTS" title="ENABLE_EXPORTS" id="index-0-prop_tgt:ENABLE_EXPORTS"><code>ENABLE_EXPORTS</code></a>) on Windows. The module definition file will be passed to the linker causing all symbols to be exported from the <code>.dll</code>. For global <em>data</em> symbols, <code>__declspec(dllimport)</code> must still be used when compiling against the code in the <code>.dll</code>. All other function symbols will be automatically exported and imported by callers. This simplifies porting projects to Windows by reducing the need for explicit <code>dllexport</code> markup, even in <code>C++</code> classes.</p> <p>When this property is enabled, zero or more <code>.def</code> files may also be specified as source files of the target. The exports named by these files will be merged with those detected from the object files to generate a single module definition file to be passed to the linker. This can be used to export symbols from a <code>.dll</code> that are not in any of its object files but are added by the linker from dependencies (e.g. <code>msvcrt.lib</code>).</p> <p>This property is initialized by the value of the <a class="reference internal" href="../variable/cmake_windows_export_all_symbols.html#variable:CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS" title="CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS"><code>CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS</code></a> variable if it is set when a target is created.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
