<h1 id="prop_tgt:EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL">EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</h1> <p>Set this target property to a true (or false) value to exclude (or include) the target from the "all" target of the containing directory and its ancestors. If excluded, running e.g. <code>make</code> in the containing directory or its ancestors will not build the target by default.</p> <p>If this target property is not set then the target will be included in the "all" target of the containing directory. Furthermore, it will be included in the "all" target of its ancestor directories unless the <a class="reference internal" href="../prop_dir/exclude_from_all.html#prop_dir:EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL" title="EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL" id="index-0-prop_dir:EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL"><code>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</code></a> directory property is set.</p> <p>With <code>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</code> set to false or not set at all, the target will be brought up to date as part of doing a <code>make install</code> or its equivalent for the CMake generator being used.</p> <p>If a target has <code>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</code> set to true, it may still be listed in an <a class="reference internal" href="../command/install.html#command:install" title="install" id="index-0-command:install"><code>install(TARGETS)</code></a> command, but the user is responsible for ensuring that the target's build artifacts are not missing or outdated when an install is performed.</p> <p>This property may use "generator expressions" with the syntax <code>$&lt;...&gt;</code>. See the <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html#manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)" title="cmake-generator-expressions(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)"><code>cmake-generator-expressions(7)</code></a> manual for available expressions.</p> <p>Only the "Ninja Multi-Config" generator supports a property value that varies by configuration. For all other generators the value of this property must be the same for all configurations.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
