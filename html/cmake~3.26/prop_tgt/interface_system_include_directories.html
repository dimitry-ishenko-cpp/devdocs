<h1 id="prop_tgt:INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES">INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</h1> <p>List of public system include directories for a library.</p> <p>Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories which contain system headers, and therefore should not result in compiler warnings. Additionally, system include directories are searched after normal include directories regardless of the order specified.</p> <p>When the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/target_include_directories.html#command:target_include_directories" title="target_include_directories" id="index-0-command:target_include_directories"><code>target_include_directories()</code></a> command is given the <code>SYSTEM</code> keyword, it populates this property with values provided after the <code>PUBLIC</code> and <code>INTERFACE</code> keywords.</p> <p>Projects may also get and set the property directly, but must be aware that adding directories to this property does not make those directories used during compilation. Adding directories to this property marks directories as system directories which otherwise would be used in a non-system manner. This can appear similar to duplication, so prefer the high-level <a class="reference internal" href="../command/target_include_directories.html#command:target_include_directories" title="target_include_directories" id="index-1-command:target_include_directories"><code>target_include_directories()</code></a> command with the <code>SYSTEM</code> keyword and avoid setting the property directly.</p> <p>When target dependencies are specified using <a class="reference internal" href="../command/target_link_libraries.html#command:target_link_libraries" title="target_link_libraries" id="index-0-command:target_link_libraries"><code>target_link_libraries()</code></a>, CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to mark the same include directories as containing system headers.</p> <p>Contents of <code>INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> may use "generator expressions" with the syntax <code>$&lt;...&gt;</code>. See the <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html#manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)" title="cmake-generator-expressions(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)"><code>cmake-generator-expressions(7)</code></a> manual for available expressions.
