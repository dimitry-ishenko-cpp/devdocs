<h1 id="prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES">IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES</h1> <p>Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.</p> <p>Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of their implementation. On some platforms the linker searches for the dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the link. Set this property to the list of dependent shared libraries of an imported library. The list should be disjoint from the list of interface libraries in the <a class="reference internal" href="interface_link_libraries.html#prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES" title="INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES" id="index-0-prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES"><code>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</code></a> property. On platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the link command line. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
