<h1 id="prop_sf:OBJECT_DEPENDS">OBJECT_DEPENDS</h1> <p>Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.</p> <p>Specifies a <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-language.7.html#cmake-language-lists"><span class="std std-ref">semicolon-separated list</span></a> of full-paths to files on which any object files compiled from this source file depend.

Although the property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer necessary. If the generated header file is created by a custom command in the same target as the source file, the automatic dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency. If the generated header file is created by another target, an inter-target dependency should be created with the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/add_dependencies.html#command:add_dependencies" title="add_dependencies" id="index-0-command:add_dependencies"><code>add_dependencies()</code></a> command (if one does not already exist due to linking relationships).</p>  <div class="_attribution">
