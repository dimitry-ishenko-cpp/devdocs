<h1 id="prop_sf:SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION">SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 3.16.</span></p> </div> <p>Setting this property to true ensures the source file will be skipped by unity builds when its associated target has its <a class="reference internal" href="../prop_tgt/unity_build.html#prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD" title="UNITY_BUILD" id="index-0-prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD"><code>UNITY_BUILD</code></a> property set to true. The source file will instead be compiled on its own in the same way as it would with unity builds disabled.</p> <p>This property helps with "ODR (One definition rule)" problems where combining a particular source file with others might lead to build errors or other unintended side effects.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
