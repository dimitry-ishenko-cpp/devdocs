<h1 id="module:Dart">Dart</h1> <p>Configure a project for testing with CTest or old Dart Tcl Client</p> <p>This file is the backwards-compatibility version of the CTest module. It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client for driving dashboard submissions as well as testing with CTest. This module should be included in the CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project. Typical usage:</p> <pre data-language="none">include(Dart)
if(BUILD_TESTING)
  # ... testing related CMake code ...
endif()
</pre> <p>The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the Dart module to determine whether testing support should be enabled. The default is ON.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
