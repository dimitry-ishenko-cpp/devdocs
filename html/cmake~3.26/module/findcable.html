<h1 id="module:FindCABLE">FindCABLE</h1> <p>Find CABLE</p> <p>This module finds if CABLE is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are. This code sets the following variables:</p> <pre data-language="none">CABLE             the path to the cable executable
CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY the path to the Tcl wrapper library
CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR the path to the include directory
</pre> <p>To build Tcl wrappers, you should add shared library and link it to ${CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY}. You should also add ${CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR} as an include directory.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
