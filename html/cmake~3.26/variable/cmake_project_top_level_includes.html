The files will be included immediately after the toolchain file has been read (if one is specified) and platform variables have been set, but before any languages have been enabled. Therefore, language-specific variables, including things like <a class="reference internal" href="#" title="CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER"><code>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER</code></a>, might not be set.

It provides an injection point for things like configuring package managers, adding logic the user shares between projects (e.g. defining their own custom build types), and so on. It is primarily for users to add things specific to their environment, but not for specifying the toolchain details (use <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_toolchain_file.html#variable:CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE" title="CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE"><code>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</code></a> for that).</p> <p>By default, this variable is empty. It is intended to be set by the user.</p> <p>See also the <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_project_include.html#variable:CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE" title="CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE"><code>CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE</code></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_project_include_before.html#variable:CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE" title="CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE"><code>CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE</code></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#" title="CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE"><code>CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE</code></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="#" title="CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE_BEFORE" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE_BEFORE"><code>CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE_BEFORE</code></a> variables.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
