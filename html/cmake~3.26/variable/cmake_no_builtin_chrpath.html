<h1 id="variable:CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH">CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH</h1> <p>Do not use the builtin binary editor to fix runtime library search paths on installation.</p> <p>When an ELF or XCOFF binary needs to have a different runtime library search path after installation than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a builtin editor to change the runtime search path in the installed copy. If this variable is set to true then CMake will relink the binary before installation instead of using its builtin editor.</p> <p>For more information on RPATH handling see the <a class="reference internal" href="../prop_tgt/install_rpath.html#prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH" title="INSTALL_RPATH" id="index-0-prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH"><code>INSTALL_RPATH</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../prop_tgt/build_rpath.html#prop_tgt:BUILD_RPATH" title="BUILD_RPATH" id="index-0-prop_tgt:BUILD_RPATH"><code>BUILD_RPATH</code></a> target properties.</p> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 3.20: </span>This variable also applies to XCOFF binaries' LIBPATH. Prior to the addition of the XCOFF editor in CMake 3.20, this variable applied only to ELF binaries' RPATH/RUNPATH.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
