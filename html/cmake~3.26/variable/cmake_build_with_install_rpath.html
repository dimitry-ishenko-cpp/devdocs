<h1 id="variable:CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH">CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH</h1> <p>Use the install path for the <code>RPATH</code>.</p> <p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the <code>RPATH</code> when building executables etc on systems that use <code>RPATH</code>. When the software is installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install <code>RPATH</code>. If this variable is set to true then the software is always built with the install path for the <code>RPATH</code> and does not need to be relinked when installed.</p> <p>This is used to initialize the <a class="reference internal" href="../prop_tgt/build_with_install_rpath.html#prop_tgt:BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH" title="BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH" id="index-0-prop_tgt:BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH"><code>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH</code></a> target property for all targets.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
