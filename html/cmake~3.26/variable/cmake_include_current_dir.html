<h1 id="variable:CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR">CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR</h1> <p>Automatically add the current source and build directories to the include path.</p> <p>If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_current_source_dir.html#variable:CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR" title="CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR"><code>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="cmake_current_binary_dir.html#variable:CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR" title="CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR" id="index-0-variable:CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR"><code>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</code></a> to the include path for each directory. These additional include directories do not propagate down to subdirectories. This is useful mainly for out-of-source builds, where files generated into the build tree are included by files located in the source tree.</p> <p>By default <code>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR</code> is <code>OFF</code>.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
