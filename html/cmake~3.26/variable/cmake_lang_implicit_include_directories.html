<h1 id="variable:CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES">CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</h1> <p>Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.</p> <p>CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on compiler command lines for language <code>&lt;LANG&gt;</code>. This prevents system include directories from being treated as user include directories on some compilers, which is important for <code>C</code>, <code>CXX</code>, and <code>CUDA</code> to avoid overriding standard library headers.</p> <p>This value is not used for <code>Fortran</code> because it has no standard library headers and some compilers do not search their implicit include directories for module <code>.mod</code> files.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
