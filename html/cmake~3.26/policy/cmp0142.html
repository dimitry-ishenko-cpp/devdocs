This was left from very early versions of CMake in which per-config directories were not well modeled. Such paths often do not exist, resulting in warnings from the toolchain. CMake 3.25 and above prefer to not add such library search paths. This policy provides compatibility for projects that may have been accidentally relying on the old behavior.</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy is to append <code>$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)</code> to all library search paths. The <code>NEW</code> behavior is to not modify library search paths.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.25. Use the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> command to set it to <code>OLD</code> or <code>NEW</code> explicitly. Unlike many policies, CMake version 3.26.0-rc3 does <em>not</em> warn when this policy is not set and simply uses <code>OLD</code> behavior.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
