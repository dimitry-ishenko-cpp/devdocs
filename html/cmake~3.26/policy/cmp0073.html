<h1 id="policy:CMP0073">CMP0073</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 3.12.</span></p> </div> <p>Do not produce legacy <code>_LIB_DEPENDS</code> cache entries.</p> <p>Ancient CMake versions once used <code>&lt;tgt&gt;_LIB_DEPENDS</code> cache entries to propagate library link dependencies. This has long been done by other means, leaving the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/export_library_dependencies.html#command:export_library_dependencies" title="export_library_dependencies" id="index-0-command:export_library_dependencies"><code>export_library_dependencies()</code></a> command as the only user of these values. That command has long been disallowed by policy <a class="reference internal" href="cmp0033.html#policy:CMP0033" title="CMP0033" id="index-0-policy:CMP0033"><code>CMP0033</code></a>, but the <code>&lt;tgt&gt;_LIB_DEPENDS</code> cache entries were left for compatibility with possible non-standard uses by projects.</p> <p>CMake 3.12 and above now prefer to not produce these cache entries at all. This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated to avoid using them.</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy is to set <code>&lt;tgt&gt;_LIB_DEPENDS</code> cache entries. The <code>NEW</code> behavior for this policy is to not set them.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.12. Use the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> command to set it to <code>OLD</code> or <code>NEW</code> explicitly. Unlike most policies, CMake version 3.26.0-rc3 does <em>not</em> warn when this policy is not set and simply uses <code>OLD</code> behavior.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
