CMake's real implicit dependency scanner has evolved since then but is not exposed through this command. The scanning capabilities of this command are very limited and this functionality is better achieved through dedicated outside tools.</p> <p>CMake &gt;= 3.0 prefer that this command never be called. The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy is to allow the command to be called. The <code>NEW</code> behavior for this policy is to issue a <code>FATAL_ERROR</code> when the command is called.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0. CMake version 3.26.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses <code>OLD</code> behavior. Use the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> command to set it to <code>OLD</code> or <code>NEW</code> explicitly.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
