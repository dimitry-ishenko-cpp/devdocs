<h1 id="policy:CMP0010">CMP0010</h1> <p>Bad variable reference syntax is an error.</p> <p>In CMake 2.6.2 and below, incorrect variable reference syntax such as a missing close-brace (<code>${FOO</code>) was reported but did not stop processing of CMake code. This policy determines whether a bad variable reference is an error. The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy is to warn about the error, leave the string untouched, and continue. The <code>NEW</code> behavior for this policy is to report an error.</p> <p>If <a class="reference internal" href="cmp0053.html#policy:CMP0053" title="CMP0053" id="index-0-policy:CMP0053"><code>CMP0053</code></a> is set to <code>NEW</code>, this policy has no effect and is treated as always being <code>NEW</code>.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3. CMake version 3.26.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses <code>OLD</code> behavior. Use the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> command to set it to <code>OLD</code> or <code>NEW</code> explicitly.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
