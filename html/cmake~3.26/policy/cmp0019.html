<h1 id="policy:CMP0019">CMP0019</h1> <p>Do not re-expand variables in include and link information.</p> <p>CMake 2.8.10 and lower re-evaluated values given to the include_directories, link_directories, and link_libraries commands to expand any leftover variable references at the end of the configuration step. This was for strict compatibility with VERY early CMake versions because all variable references are now normally evaluated during CMake language processing. CMake 2.8.11 and higher prefer to skip the extra evaluation.</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy is to re-evaluate the values for strict compatibility. The <code>NEW</code> behavior for this policy is to leave the values untouched.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.11. CMake version 3.26.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses <code>OLD</code> behavior. Use the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> command to set it to <code>OLD</code> or <code>NEW</code> explicitly.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of a policy is <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-policies.7.html#manual:cmake-policies(7)" title="cmake-policies(7)" id="index-0-manual:cmake-policies(7)"><code>deprecated by definition</code></a> and may be removed in a future version of CMake.</p> </div>  <div class="_attribution">
