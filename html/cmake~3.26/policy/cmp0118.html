<h1 id="policy:CMP0118">CMP0118</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 3.20.</span></p> </div> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../prop_sf/generated.html#prop_sf:GENERATED" title="GENERATED" id="index-0-prop_sf:GENERATED"><code>GENERATED</code></a> source file property is now visible in all directories.</p> <p>Whether or not a source file is generated is an all-or-nothing global property of the source. Consequently, the associated <code>GENERATED</code> property is now visible from any directory scope, not only from the scope for which it was set.</p> <p>Additionally, the <code>GENERATED</code> property may now be set only to boolean values, and may not be turned off once turned on.</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior of this policy is to only allow <code>GENERATED</code> to be visible from the directory scope for which it was set. The <code>NEW</code> behavior on the other hand allows it to be visible from any scope.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.20. Use the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/cmake_policy.html#command:cmake_policy" title="cmake_policy" id="index-0-command:cmake_policy"><code>cmake_policy()</code></a> command to set it to <code>OLD</code> or <code>NEW</code> explicitly. Unlike many policies, CMake version 3.26.0-rc3 does <em>not</em> warn when this policy is not set and simply uses <code>OLD</code> behavior with regard to visibility of the <code>GENERATED</code> property. However, CMake does warn about setting the <code>GENERATED</code> property to a non-boolean value.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
