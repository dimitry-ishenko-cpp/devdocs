<h1 id="policy:CMP0060">CMP0060</h1> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 3.3.</span></p> </div> <p>Link libraries by full path even in implicit directories.</p> <p>Policy <a class="reference internal" href="cmp0003.html#policy:CMP0003" title="CMP0003" id="index-0-policy:CMP0003"><code>CMP0003</code></a> was introduced with the intention of always linking library files by full path when a full path is given to the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/target_link_libraries.html#command:target_link_libraries" title="target_link_libraries" id="index-0-command:target_link_libraries"><code>target_link_libraries()</code></a> command. However, on some platforms (e.g. HP-UX) the compiler front-end adds alternative library search paths for the current architecture (e.g. <code>/usr/lib/&lt;arch&gt;</code> has alternatives to libraries in <code>/usr/lib</code> for the current architecture). On such platforms the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/find_library.html#command:find_library" title="find_library" id="index-0-command:find_library"><code>find_library()</code></a> may find a library such as <code>/usr/lib/libfoo.so</code> that does not belong to the current architecture.</p> <p>Prior to policy <a class="reference internal" href="cmp0003.html#policy:CMP0003" title="CMP0003" id="index-1-policy:CMP0003"><code>CMP0003</code></a> projects would still build in such cases because the incorrect library path would be converted to <code>-lfoo</code> on the link line and the linker would find the proper library in the arch-specific search path provided by the compiler front-end implicitly. At the time we chose to remain compatible with such projects by always converting library files found in implicit link directories to <code>-lfoo</code> flags to ask the linker to search for them. This approach allowed existing projects to continue to build while still linking to libraries outside implicit link directories via full path (such as those in the build tree).</p> <p>CMake does allow projects to override this behavior by using an <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#imported-targets"><span class="std std-ref">IMPORTED library target</span></a> with its <a class="reference internal" href="../prop_tgt/imported_location.html#prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LOCATION" title="IMPORTED_LOCATION" id="index-0-prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LOCATION"><code>IMPORTED_LOCATION</code></a> property set to the desired full path to a library file. In fact, many <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-developer.7.html#find-modules"><span class="std std-ref">Find Modules</span></a> are learning to provide <a class="reference internal" href="../manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#imported-targets"><span class="std std-ref">Imported Targets</span></a> instead of just the traditional <code>Foo_LIBRARIES</code> variable listing library files. However, this makes the link line generated for a library found by a Find Module depend on whether it is linked through an imported target or not, which is inconsistent. Furthermore, this behavior has been a source of confusion because the generated link line for a library file depends on its location. It is also problematic for projects trying to link statically because flags like <code>-Wl,-Bstatic -lfoo -Wl,-Bdynamic</code> may be used to help the linker select <code>libfoo.a</code> instead of <code>libfoo.so</code> but then leak dynamic linking to following libraries. (See the <a class="reference internal" href="../prop_tgt/link_search_end_static.html#prop_tgt:LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC" title="LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC" id="index-0-prop_tgt:LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC"><code>LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC</code></a> target property for a solution typically used for that problem.)</p> <p>When the special case for libraries in implicit link directories was first introduced the list of implicit link directories was simply hard-coded (e.g. <code>/lib</code>, <code>/usr/lib</code>, and a few others). Since that time, CMake has learned to detect the implicit link directories used by the compiler front-end. If necessary, the <a class="reference internal" href="../command/find_library.html#command:find_library" title="find_library" id="index-1-command:find_library"><code>find_library()</code></a> command could be taught to use this information to help find libraries of the proper architecture.</p> <p>For these reasons, CMake 3.3 and above prefer to drop the special case and link libraries by full path even when they are in implicit link directories. Policy <code>CMP0060</code> provides compatibility for existing projects.</p> <p>The <code>OLD</code> behavior for this policy is to ask the linker to search for libraries whose full paths are known to be in implicit link directories. The <code>NEW</code> behavior for this policy is to link libraries by full path even if they are in implicit link directories.</p> <p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3. Unlike most policies, CMake version 3.26.0-rc3 does <em>not</em> warn by default when this policy is not set and simply uses <code>OLD</code> behavior.
