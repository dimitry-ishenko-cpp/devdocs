<h1 id="prop_gbl:GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES">GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES</h1> <p>Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.</p> <p>CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph at the beginning of native build system generation. It reports an error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist of all STATIC library targets. This property tells CMake to disallow all cycles completely, even among static libraries.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
