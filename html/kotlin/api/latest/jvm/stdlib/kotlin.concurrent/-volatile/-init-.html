<div data-kotlin-version="1.0" data-platform="Common"> <h5>For Common</h5> <p>Marks the backing field of the annotated <code>var</code> property as <code>volatile</code>, meaning that reads and writes to this field are atomic and writes are always made visible to other threads. If another thread reads the value of this field (e.g. through its accessor), it sees not only that value, but all side effects that led to writing that value.</p> <p>This annotation has effect in Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/Native.</p> <p>Note that only <em>backing field</em> operations are atomic when the field is annotated with <code>Volatile</code>. For example, if the property getter or setter make several operations with the backing field, a <em>property</em> operation, i.e. reading or setting it through these accessors, is not guaranteed to be atomic.</p> </div>
