<div class="getting-started-title"> <small>Mix and OTP</small> <h1>Dependencies and umbrella projects</h1> </div>  <blockquote> <p>This chapter is part of the <i>Mix and OTP guide</i> and it depends on previous chapters in this guide. For more information, <a href="introduction-to-mix.html">read the introduction guide</a> or check out the chapter index in the sidebar.</p> </blockquote> <p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to manage dependencies in Mix.</p> <p>Our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code> application is complete, so it’s time to implement the server that will handle the requests we defined in the first chapter:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">CREATE shopping
OK

PUT shopping milk 1
OK

PUT shopping eggs 3
OK

GET shopping milk
1
OK

DELETE shopping eggs
OK
</pre></div> <p>However, instead of adding more code to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code> application, we are going to build the TCP server as another application that is a client of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code> application. Since the whole runtime and Elixir ecosystem are geared towards applications, it makes sense to break our projects into smaller applications that work together rather than building a big, monolithic app.</p> <p>Before creating our new application, we must discuss how Mix handles dependencies. In practice, there are two kinds of dependencies we usually work with: internal and external dependencies. Mix supports mechanisms to work with both of them.</p> <h2 id="external-dependencies">External dependencies</h2> <p>External dependencies are the ones not tied to your business domain. For example, if you need an HTTP API for your distributed KV application, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug">Plug</a> project as an external dependency.</p> <p>Installing external dependencies is simple. Most commonly, we use the <a href="https://hex.pm">Hex Package Manager</a>, by listing the dependency inside the deps function in our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code> file:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">def deps do
  [{:plug, "~&gt; 1.0"}]
end
</pre></div> <p>This dependency refers to the latest version of Plug in the 1.x.x version series that has been pushed to Hex. This is indicated by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~&gt;</code> preceding the version number. For more information on specifying version requirements, see the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Version.html">documentation for the Version module</a>.</p> <p>Typically, stable releases are pushed to Hex. If you want to depend on an external dependency still in development, Mix is able to manage Git dependencies too:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">def deps do
  [{:plug, git: "https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug.git"}]
end
</pre></div> <p>You will notice that when you add a dependency to your project, Mix generates a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.lock</code> file that guarantees <em>repeatable builds</em>. The lock file must be checked in to your version control system, to guarantee that everyone who uses the project will use the same dependency versions as you.</p> <p>Mix provides many tasks for working with dependencies, which can be seen in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix help</code>:</p> <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ mix help
mix deps              # Lists dependencies and their status
mix deps.clean        # Deletes the given dependencies' files
mix deps.compile      # Compiles dependencies
mix deps.get          # Gets all out of date dependencies
mix deps.tree         # Prints the dependency tree
mix deps.unlock       # Unlocks the given dependencies
mix deps.update       # Updates the given dependencies
</pre></div> <p>The most common tasks are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix deps.get</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix deps.update</code>. Once fetched, dependencies are automatically compiled for you. You can read more about deps by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix help deps</code>, and in the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Deps.html">documentation for the Mix.Tasks.Deps module</a>.</p> <h2 id="internal-dependencies">Internal dependencies</h2> <p>Internal dependencies are the ones that are specific to your project. They usually don’t make sense outside the scope of your project/company/organization. Most of the time, you want to keep them private, whether due to technical, economic or business reasons.</p> <p>If you have an internal dependency, Mix supports two methods to work with them: Git repositories or umbrella projects.</p> <p>For example, if you push the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code> project to a Git repository, you’ll need to list it in your deps code in order to use it:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">def deps do
  [{:kv, git: "https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/kv.git"}]
end
</pre></div> <p>If the repository is private though, you may need to specify the private URL <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git@github.com:YOUR_ACCOUNT/kv.git</code>. In any case, Mix will be able to fetch it for you as long as you have the proper credentials.</p> <p>Using Git repositories for internal dependencies is somewhat discouraged in Elixir. Remember that the runtime and the Elixir ecosystem already provide the concept of applications. As such, we expect you to frequently break your code into applications that can be organized logically, even within a single project.</p> <p>However, if you push every application as a separate project to a Git repository, your projects may become very hard to maintain as you will spend a lot of time managing those Git repositories rather than writing your code.</p> <p>For this reason, Mix supports “umbrella projects”. Umbrella projects are used to build applications that run together in a single repository. That is exactly the style we are going to explore in the next sections.</p> <p>Let’s create a new Mix project. We are going to creatively name it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv_umbrella</code>, and this new project will have both the existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code> application and the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv_server</code> application inside. The directory structure will look like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">+ kv_umbrella
  + apps
    + kv
    + kv_server
</pre></div> <p>The interesting thing about this approach is that Mix has many conveniences for working with such projects, such as the ability to compile and test all applications inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps</code> with a single command. However, even though they are all listed together inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps</code>, they are still decoupled from each other, so you can build, test and deploy each application in isolation if you want to.</p> <p>So let’s get started!</p> <h2 id="umbrella-projects">Umbrella projects</h2> <p>Let’s start a new project using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix new</code>. This new project will be named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv_umbrella</code> and we need to pass the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--umbrella</code> option when creating it. Do not create this new project inside the existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code> project!</p> <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ mix new kv_umbrella --umbrella
* creating README.md
* creating .formatter.exs
* creating .gitignore
* creating mix.exs
* creating apps
* creating config
* creating config/config.exs
</pre></div> <p>From the printed information, we can see far fewer files are generated. The generated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code> file is different too. Let’s take a look (comments have been removed):</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">defmodule KvUmbrella.MixProject do
  use Mix.Project

  def project do
    [
      apps_path: "apps",
      start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod,
      deps: deps()
    ]
  end

  defp deps do
    []
  end
end
</pre></div> <p>What makes this project different from the previous one is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps_path: "apps"</code> entry in the project definition. This means this project will act as an umbrella. Such projects do not have source files nor tests, although they can have their own dependencies. Each child application must be defined inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps</code> directory.</p> <p>Let’s move inside the apps directory and start building <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv_server</code>. This time, we are going to pass the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--sup</code> flag, which will tell Mix to generate a supervision tree automatically for us, instead of building one manually as we did in previous chapters:</p> <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ cd kv_umbrella/apps
$ mix new kv_server --module KVServer --sup
</pre></div> <p>The generated files are similar to the ones we first generated for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code>, with a few differences. Let’s open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code>:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">defmodule KVServer.MixProject do
  use Mix.Project

  def project do
    [
      app: :kv_server,
      version: "0.1.0",
      build_path: "../../_build",
      config_path: "../../config/config.exs",
      deps_path: "../../deps",
      lockfile: "../../mix.lock",
      elixir: "~&gt; 1.14",
      start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod,
      deps: deps()
    ]
  end

  # Run "mix help compile.app" to learn about applications
  def application do
    [
      extra_applications: [:logger],
      mod: {KVServer.Application, []}
    ]
  end

  # Run "mix help deps" to learn about dependencies
  defp deps do
    [
      # {:dep_from_hexpm, "~&gt; 0.3.0"},
      # {:dep_from_git, git: "https://github.com/elixir-lang/my_dep.git", tag: "0.1.0"},
      # {:sibling_app_in_umbrella, in_umbrella: true},
    ]
  end
end
</pre></div> <p>First of all, since we generated this project inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv_umbrella/apps</code>, Mix automatically detected the umbrella structure and added four lines to the project definition:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">build_path: "../../_build",
config_path: "../../config/config.exs",
deps_path: "../../deps",
lockfile: "../../mix.lock",
</pre></div> <p>Those options mean all dependencies will be checked out to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv_umbrella/deps</code>, and they will share the same build, config, and lock files. We haven’t talked about configuration yet, but keep in mind all configuration and dependencies are shared across all projects in an umbrella, and it is not per application.</p> <p>The second change is in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">application</code> function inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code>:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">def application do
  [
    extra_applications: [:logger],
    mod: {KVServer.Application, []}
  ]
end
</pre></div> <p>Because we passed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--sup</code> flag, Mix automatically added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod: {KVServer.Application, []}</code>, specifying that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KVServer.Application</code> is our application callback module. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KVServer.Application</code> will start our application supervision tree.</p> <p>In fact, let’s open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/kv_server/application.ex</code>:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">defmodule KVServer.Application do
  # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html
  # for more information on OTP Applications
  @moduledoc false

  use Application

  @impl true
  def start(_type, _args) do
    # List all child processes to be supervised
    children = [
      # Starts a worker by calling: KVServer.Worker.start_link(arg)
      # {KVServer.Worker, arg},
    ]

    # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html
    # for other strategies and supported options
    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: KVServer.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
</pre></div> <p>Notice that it defines the application callback function, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start/2</code>, and instead of defining a supervisor named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KVServer.Supervisor</code> that uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Supervisor</code> module, it conveniently defined the supervisor inline! You can read more about such supervisors by reading <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html">the Supervisor module documentation</a>.</p> <p>We can already try out our first umbrella child. We could run tests inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/kv_server</code> directory, but that wouldn’t be much fun. Instead, go to the root of the umbrella project and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix test</code>:</p> <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">$ mix test
</pre></div> <p>And it works!</p> <p>Since we want <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv_server</code> to eventually use the functionality we defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code>, we need to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code> as a dependency to our application.</p> <h2 id="dependencies-within-an-umbrella-project">Dependencies within an umbrella project</h2> <p>Dependencies between applications in an umbrella project must still be explicitly defined and Mix makes it easy to do so. Open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/kv_server/mix.exs</code> and change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deps/0</code> function to the following:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">defp deps do
  [{:kv, in_umbrella: true}]
end
</pre></div> <p>The line above makes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> available as a dependency inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv_server</code> and automatically starts the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> application before the server starts.</p> <p>Finally, copy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code> application we have built so far to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps</code> directory in our new umbrella project. The final directory structure should match the structure we mentioned earlier:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">+ kv_umbrella
  + apps
    + kv
    + kv_server
</pre></div> <p>We now need to modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/kv/mix.exs</code> to contain the umbrella entries we have seen in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/kv_server/mix.exs</code>. Open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/kv/mix.exs</code> and add to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project/0</code> function:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">build_path: "../../_build",
config_path: "../../config/config.exs",
deps_path: "../../deps",
lockfile: "../../mix.lock",
</pre></div> <p>Now you can run tests for both projects from the umbrella root with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix test</code>. Sweet!</p> <h2 id="dont-drink-the-kool-aid">Don’t drink the kool aid</h2> <p>Umbrella projects are a convenience to help you organize and manage multiple applications. While it provides a degree of separation between applications, those applications are not fully decoupled, as they share the same configuration and the same dependencies.</p> <p>The pattern of keeping multiple applications in the same repository is known as “mono-repo”. Umbrella projects maximize this pattern by providing conveniences to compile, test and run multiple applications at once.</p> <p>If you find yourself in a position where you want to use different configurations in each application for the same dependency or use different dependency versions, then it is likely your codebase has grown beyond what umbrellas can provide.</p> <p>The good news is that breaking an umbrella apart is quite straightforward, as you simply need to move applications outside of the umbrella project’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/</code> directory and update the project’s mix.exs file to no longer set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build_path</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config_path</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deps_path</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lockfile</code> configuration. You can depend on private projects outside of the umbrella in multiple ways:</p> <ol> <li>Move it to a separate folder within the same repository and point to it using a path dependency (the mono-repo pattern)</li> <li>Move the repository to a separate Git repository and depend on it</li> <li>Publish the project to a private <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> organization</li> </ol> <h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2> <p>In this chapter, we have learned more about Mix dependencies and umbrella projects. While we may run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code> without a server, our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv_server</code> depends directly on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code>. By breaking them into separate applications, we gain more control in how they are developed and tested.</p> <p>When using umbrella applications, it is important to have a clear boundary between them. Our upcoming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv_server</code> must only access public APIs defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kv</code>. Think of your umbrella apps as any other dependency or even Elixir itself: you can only access what is public and documented. Reaching into private functionality in your dependencies is a poor practice that will eventually cause your code to break when a new version is up.</p> <p>Umbrella applications can also be used as a stepping stone for eventually extracting an application from your codebase. For example, imagine a web application that has to send “push notifications” to its users. The whole “push notifications system” can be developed as a separate application in the umbrella, with its own supervision tree and APIs. If you ever run into a situation where another project needs the push notifications system, the system can be moved to a private repository or a Hex package.</p> <p>Developers may also use umbrella projects to break large business domains apart. The caution here is to make sure the domains don’t depend on each other (also known as cyclic dependencies). If you run into such situations, it means those applications are not as isolated from each other as you originally thought, and you have architectural and design issues to solve.</p> <p>Finally, keep in mind that applications in an umbrella project all share the same configurations and dependencies. If two applications in your umbrella need to configure the same dependency in drastically different ways or even use different versions, you have probably outgrown the benefits brought by umbrellas. Remember you can break the umbrella and still leverage the benefits behind “mono-repos”.</p> <p>With our umbrella project up and running, it is time to start writing our server.</p><div class="_attribution">
