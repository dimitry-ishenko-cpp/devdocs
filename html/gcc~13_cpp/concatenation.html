This is called <em class="dfn">token pasting</em> or <em class="dfn">token concatenation</em>. The ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ preprocessing operator performs token pasting. When a macro is expanded, the two tokens on either side of each ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ operator are combined into a single token, which then replaces the ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ and the two original tokens in the macro expansion. Usually both will be identifiers, or one will be an identifier and the other a preprocessing number. When pasted, they make a longer identifier. This isn’t the only valid case. It is also possible to concatenate two numbers (or a number and a name, such as <code class="code">1.5</code> and <code class="code">e3</code>) into a number. Also, multi-character operators such as <code class="code">+=</code> can be formed by token pasting. </p> <p>However, two tokens that don’t together form a valid token cannot be pasted together. For example, you cannot concatenate <code class="code">x</code> with <code class="code">+</code> in either order. If you try, the preprocessor issues a warning and emits the two tokens. Whether it puts white space between the tokens is undefined. It is common to find unnecessary uses of ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ in complex macros. If you get this warning, it is likely that you can simply remove the ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’. </p> <p>Both the tokens combined by ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ could come from the macro body, but you could just as well write them as one token in the first place. Token pasting is most useful when one or both of the tokens comes from a macro argument. If either of the tokens next to an ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ is a parameter name, it is replaced by its actual argument before ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ executes. As with stringizing, the actual argument is not macro-expanded first. If the argument is empty, that ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ has no effect. </p> <p>Keep in mind that the C preprocessor converts comments to whitespace before macros are even considered. Therefore, you cannot create a comment by concatenating ‘<samp class="samp">/</samp>’ and ‘<samp class="samp">*</samp>’. You can put as much whitespace between ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ and its operands as you like, including comments, and you can put comments in arguments that will be concatenated. However, it is an error if ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ appears at either end of a macro body. </p> <p>Consider a C program that interprets named commands. There probably needs to be a table of commands, perhaps an array of structures declared as follows: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">struct command
{
  char *name;
  void (*function) (void);
};</pre></div>

<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">struct command commands[] =
{
  { "quit", quit_command },
  { "help", help_command },
  …
};</pre></div>
</div> <p>It would be cleaner not to have to give each command name twice, once in the string constant and once in the function name. A macro which takes the name of a command as an argument can make this unnecessary. The string constant can be created with stringizing, and the function name by concatenating the argument with ‘<samp class="samp">_command</samp>’. Here is how it is done: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#define COMMAND(NAME)  { #NAME, NAME ## _command }

struct command commands[] =
{
  COMMAND (quit),
  COMMAND (help),
  …
};</pre>
