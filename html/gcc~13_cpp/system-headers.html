Therefore, GCC gives code found in <em class="dfn">system headers</em> special treatment. All warnings, other than those generated by ‘<samp class="samp">#warning</samp>’ (see <a class="pxref" href="diagnostics.html">Diagnostics</a>), are suppressed while GCC is processing a system header. Macros defined in a system header are immune to a few warnings wherever they are expanded. This immunity is granted on an ad-hoc basis, when we find that a warning generates lots of false positives because of code in macros defined in system headers. </p> <p>Normally, only the headers found in specific directories are considered system headers. These directories are determined when GCC is compiled. There are, however, two ways to make normal headers into system headers: </p> <ul class="itemize mark-bullet"> <li>Header files found in directories added to the search path with the <samp class="option">-isystem</samp> and <samp class="option">-idirafter</samp> command-line options are treated as system headers for the purposes of diagnostics. </li>
<li>
 There is also a directive, <code class="code">#pragma GCC system_header</code>, which tells GCC to consider the rest of the current include file a system header, no matter where it was found. Code that comes before the ‘<samp class="samp">#pragma</samp>’ in the file is not affected. <code class="code">#pragma GCC system_header</code> has no effect in the primary source file. </li>
</ul> <p>On some targets, such as RS/6000 AIX, GCC implicitly surrounds all system headers with an ‘<samp class="samp">extern "C"</samp>’ block when compiling as C++. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
