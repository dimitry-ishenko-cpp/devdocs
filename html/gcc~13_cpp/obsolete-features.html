We discourage their use in new code. In some cases, we plan to remove the feature in a future version of GCC. </p> <ul class="mini-toc"> <li><a href="#Assertions" accesskey="1">Assertions</a></li> </ul> <div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Assertions"> <h2 class="subsection"><span>11.3.1 Assertions<a class="copiable-link" href="#Assertions"> ¶</a></span></h2>  <p><em class="dfn">Assertions</em> are a deprecated alternative to macros in writing conditionals to test what sort of computer or system the compiled program will run on. Assertions are usually predefined, but you can define them with preprocessing directives or command-line options. </p> <p>Assertions were intended to provide a more systematic way to describe the compiler’s target system and we added them for compatibility with existing compilers. In practice they are just as unpredictable as the system-specific predefined macros. In addition, they are not part of any standard, and only a few compilers support them. Therefore, the use of assertions is <strong class="strong">less</strong> portable than the use of system-specific predefined macros. We recommend you do not use them at all. </p>  <p>An assertion looks like this: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#<var class="var">predicate</var> (<var class="var">answer</var>)</pre>
</div> <p><var class="var">predicate</var> must be a single identifier. <var class="var">answer</var> can be any sequence of tokens; all characters are significant except for leading and trailing whitespace, and differences in internal whitespace sequences are ignored. (This is similar to the rules governing macro redefinition.) Thus, <code class="code">(x + y)</code> is different from <code class="code">(x+y)</code> but equivalent to <code class="code">( x + y )</code>. Parentheses do not nest inside an answer. </p>  <p>To test an assertion, you write it in an ‘<samp class="samp">#if</samp>’. For example, this conditional succeeds if either <code class="code">vax</code> or <code class="code">ns16000</code> has been asserted as an answer for <code class="code">machine</code>. </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#if #machine (vax) || #machine (ns16000)</pre>
</div> <p>You can test whether <em class="emph">any</em> answer is asserted for a predicate by omitting the answer in the conditional: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#if #machine</pre>
</div>  <p>Assertions are made with the ‘<samp class="samp">#assert</samp>’ directive. Its sole argument is the assertion to make, without the leading ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’ that identifies assertions in conditionals. </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#assert <var class="var">predicate</var> (<var class="var">answer</var>)</pre>
</div> <p>You may make several assertions with the same predicate and different answers. Subsequent assertions do not override previous ones for the same predicate. All the answers for any given predicate are simultaneously true. </p>   <p>Assertions can be canceled with the ‘<samp class="samp">#unassert</samp>’ directive. It has the same syntax as ‘<samp class="samp">#assert</samp>’. In that form it cancels only the answer which was specified on the ‘<samp class="samp">#unassert</samp>’ line; other answers for that predicate remain true. You can cancel an entire predicate by leaving out the answer: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">#unassert <var class="var">predicate</var></pre>
</div> <p>In either form, if no such assertion has been made, ‘<samp class="samp">#unassert</samp>’ has no effect. </p> <p>You can also make or cancel assertions using command-line options.
