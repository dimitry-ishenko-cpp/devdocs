On some systems, that string constant is copied into a special segment of the object file. On other systems, the directive is ignored. The ‘<samp class="samp">#sccs</samp>’ directive is a synonym for ‘<samp class="samp">#ident</samp>’. </p> <p>These directives are not part of the C standard, but they are not official GNU extensions either. What historical information we have been able to find, suggests they originated with System V. </p>  <p>The <em class="dfn">null directive</em> consists of a ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’ followed by a newline, with only whitespace (including comments) in between. A null directive is understood as a preprocessing directive but has no effect on the preprocessor output. The primary significance of the existence of the null directive is that an input line consisting of just a ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’ will produce no output, rather than a line of output containing just a ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’. Supposedly some old C programs contain such lines. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
