<h2 id="value">Value</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p> An integer value which specifies the number of STUN connectivity and/or consent requests that have been received to date on the connection described by this pair of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE">ICE</a> candidates. </p> <p> Because there's no way to tell the difference between requests made to check connectivity and requests made to check consent, the returned figure includes both. </p> <div class="notecard note" id="sect1"> <p> <strong>Note:</strong> The reported number of requests includes retransmissions. If a request had to be repeated due to network issues, it will be counted multiple times here. This differs from <a href="requestssent.html"><code>requestsSent</code></a>, which <em>does not</em> include retransmisions. </p> </div>
