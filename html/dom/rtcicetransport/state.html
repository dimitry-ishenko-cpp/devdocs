<header><h1>RTCIceTransport: state property</h1></header><div class="section-content">
<p>The <code>state</code> read-only property of the <a href="../rtcicetransport.html"><code>RTCIceTransport</code></a> interface returns the current state of the ICE transport, so you can determine the state of ICE gathering in which the ICE agent currently is operating.</p> <p> This differs from the <a href="gatheringstate.html"><code>gatheringState</code></a>, which only indicates whether or not ICE gathering is currently underway. It also differs from <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/connectionstate.html"><code>RTCPeerConnection.connectionState</code></a>, which aggregates the states across every <a href="../rtcicetransport.html"><code>RTCIceTransport</code></a> used by every <a href="../rtcrtpsender.html"><code>RTCRtpSender</code></a> and every <a href="../rtcrtpreceiver.html"><code>RTCRtpReceiver</code></a> on the entire connection. </p>

A value of <code>"disconnected"</code> means that a transient issue has occurred that has broken the connection, but that should resolve itself automatically without your code having to take any action.

<div class="section-content"><p>If an ICE restart occurs, the candidate gathering and connectivity check process is started over again; this will cause a transition from the <code>"connected"</code> state if the restart occurred while the state was <code>"completed"</code>. If the restart occurred during a transient <code>"disconnected"</code> state, the state transitions to <code>"checking"</code></p></div>
<h3 id="the_disconnected_state">The disconnected state</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p><code>"disconnected"</code> is a transient state that occurs when the connection between the two peers fails in a manner that the WebRTC infrastructure can automatically correct once the connection is available again. It is <em>not</em> a failure state. Instead, you can think of <code>"disconnected"</code> as being similar to <code>"checking"</code> but with the added information that the connection had been working but at the moment is not.</p> <p>Every <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent">user agent</a> and platform may have its own scenarios that can trigger the <code>"disconnected"</code> state. Possible causes include:</p> <ul> <li>The network interface being used by the connection has gone offline.</li> <li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/STUN">STUN</a> requests being sent to the remote device have gone unanswered repeatedly.</li> </ul> <p>The <code>"disconnected"</code> state can also occur when the transport has finished checking all existing candidate pairs and has not found a pair that will work—or a valid pair was found but rejected due to consent to use the pair being denied. In this scenario, the transport is still continuing to gather candidates, and/or to wait for candidates to be sent by the remote peer.</p>
