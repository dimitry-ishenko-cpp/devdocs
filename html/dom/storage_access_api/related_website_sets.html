<div class="notecard warning"> <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This feature is currently opposed by two browser vendors. See the <a href="#standards_positions">Standards positions</a> section below for details of opposition.</p> </div> <p>Related website sets are a mechanism for defining a set of related sites that share trusted content. As a result, browsers can grant default access for these sites to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Third-party_cookies">third-party cookies</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning#state_partitioning">unpartitioned state</a> when they have content embedded in other set members, without requiring users to grant access to the <a href="../storage_access_api.html">Storage Access API</a> via a permission prompt.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="concepts_and_usage">Concepts and usage</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Let's consider situations where you have a series of related websites with different domain names, and you want to give site content access to third-party cookies and unpartitioned state when loaded in a third-party context inside other related sites (i.e., embedded in an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>). Typical use cases are:</p> <ul> <li>App sites: A single application may be deployed over multiple sites, aiming to allow users to navigate between them seamlessly in a single session.</li> <li>Brand sites: A set of brand assets may be contained in a single site but then deployed over multiple domains, including session data relating to user preferences, customization, etc.</li> </ul> <p>Third-party cookie and unpartitioned state access is commonly blocked by browser policies. Still, you can work around it using the Storage Access API — see <a href="using.html">Using the Storage Access API</a> for details.</p> <p>Related website are a progressive enhancement mechanism that works alongside the Storage Access API. Supporting browsers grant third-party cookie and unpartitioned state access between websites in the same set <em>without</em> having to go through the usual user permission prompt workflow, once <a href="../document/requeststorageaccess.html"><code>Document.requestStorageAccess()</code></a> (or <a href="../document/requeststorageaccessfor.html"><code>Document.requestStorageAccessFor()</code></a>) is called. This results in a more user-friendly experience for users of sites in the set.</p> <p>You should bear in mind that:</p> <ul> <li>The Chrome-only <a href="../document/requeststorageaccessfor.html"><code>Document.requestStorageAccessFor()</code></a> method — which allows top-level sites to request storage access on behalf of embedded origin content — is only supported on domains within a related website set. See <a href="using.html">Using the Storage Access API</a> for an example.</li> <li>When Chrome first supported the standard Storage Access API (that is, the <a href="../document/hasstorageaccess.html"><code>Document.hasStorageAccess()</code></a> and <a href="../document/requeststorageaccess.html"><code>Document.requestStorageAccess()</code></a> methods), it required calling sites to be part of a related website set. This is no longer the case.</li> </ul>

<h2 id="how_does_rws_work">How does RWS work?</h2>
<div class="section-content"><p>A related website set consists of one primary site and up to five associated sites.</p></div>
<h3 id="json_structure">JSON structure</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>A set is represented by a JSON structure. A hypothetical example is as follows:</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="json">{
  "sets": [
    {
      "contact": "email address or group alias if available",
      "primary": "https://primary1.com",
      "associatedSites": [
        "https://associateA.com",
        "https://associateB.com",
        "https://associateC.com"
      ],
      "serviceSites": ["https://servicesiteA.com"],
      "rationaleBySite": {
        "https://associateA.com": "Explanation of affiliation with primary site",
        "https://associateB.com": "Explanation of affiliation with primary site",
        "https://associateC.com": "Explanation of affiliation with primary site",
        "https://serviceSiteA.com": "Explanation of service functionality support"
      },
      "ccTLDs": {
        "https://associateA.com": [
          "https://associateA.ca",
          "https://associateA.co.uk"
        ],
        "https://associateB.com": [
          "https://associateB.ru",
          "https://associateB.co.kr"
        ],
        "https://primary1.com": ["https://primary1.co.uk"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
</pre></div> <div class="notecard note"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The affiliation explanations must include a clear description of how the affiliation to the primary site is presented to users of those sites.</p> </div> <p>To use a set, its JSON must be added to the <code>related_website_sets.JSON</code> file available on the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/related_website_sets.JSON" target="_blank">Related Website Sets GitHub repository</a>, which Chrome then consumes to get the list of sets to apply RWS behavior to.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=".well-known_files">
<code>.well-known</code> files</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Each site in the set must also serve a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI" target="_blank"><code>.well-known</code></a> file at <code>/.well-known/related-website-set.json</code>, which serves to verify the set structure and the relationship between the sites in the set.</p> <p>The primary site's <code>.well-known</code> file must explicitly list out the full set structure. <code>https://primary1.com</code> in the above example would need a <code>https://primary1.com/.well-known/related-website-set.json</code> file similar to the following:</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="json">{
  "primary": "https://primary1.com",
  "associatedSites": [
    "https://associateA.com",
    "https://associateB.com",
    "https://associateC.com"
  ],
  "serviceSites": ["https://servicesiteA.com"],
  "rationaleBySite": {
    "https://associateA.com": "Explanation of affiliation with primary site",
    "https://associateB.com": "Explanation of affiliation with primary site",
    "https://associateC.com": "Explanation of affiliation with primary site",
    "https://serviceSiteA.com": "Explanation of service functionality support"
  },
  "ccTLDs": {
    "https://associateA.com": [
      "https://associateA.ca",
      "https://associateA.co.uk"
    ],
    "https://associateB.com": [
      "https://associateB.ru",
      "https://associateB.co.kr"
    ],
    "https://primary1.com": ["https://primary1.co.uk"]
  }
}
</pre></div> <p>Each associate and service site needs to specify its primary site in a <code>.well-known</code> file. Each non-primary site in the above example (e.g. <code>https://associateA.com</code>) would need a <code>/.well-known/related-website-set.json</code> file like this:</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="json">{
  "primary": "https://primary1.com"
}
</pre></div> <p>For full details of the process, JSON syntax, and other requirements for submitting sets, see the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/RWS-Submission_Guidelines.md" target="_blank">submission guidelines</a>. Only domain administrators can create a set containing their sites.</p> <p>Bear in mind that the <code>.well-known</code> files are also verified as part of the submission process, so they need to be put in place before the associated set is submitted.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="active_set_benefits">Active set benefits</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Once a set is active:</p> <ul> <li>Requests from sites in the set (via <a href="../document/requeststorageaccess.html"><code>Document.requestStorageAccess()</code></a>) to access third-party cookies and unpartitioned state that belong to sites in the set are automatically granted, and no user permission step is required.</li> <li>
<a href="../document/requeststorageaccessfor.html"><code>Document.requestStorageAccessFor()</code></a> calls can be made from top-level sites in the set to request third-party cookie access for other sites in the set.</li> </ul>
</div>
<h2 id="rws_security">RWS security</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>RWS has been designed with security in mind. It would be disastrous if a bad actor site were able to claim to be part of a set and gain the privileges that entails. Lets consider a theoretical bad actor site, <code>evilsite.example.com</code>, and look at some examples of attacks it could try to make, all of which would fail:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>evilsite.example.com</code>: If a site claiming to be in a set (<code>i.e.</code> by listing a primary in a <code>.well-known</code> file) is not included in the set submission and/or primary's <code>.well-known</code> file, it won't get the benefits of being in the set.</li> <li>
<code>evilsite.example.com</code>: The submission process requires that <code>.well-known</code> files hosted by non-primary sites explicitly list out their primary. If this primary doesn't match the set submission (i.e. if the associated/service sites expect to have a different primary, or don't expect to be in a set at all), the submission will be rejected.</li> <li>
<strong><code>site1.example.com</code> and <code>site2.example.com</code> are intentionally in the same set, but <code>site1.example.com</code> gets hijacked by <code>evilsite.example.com</code></strong>: The impact of a site hijacking attack within a set isn't any worse than it would usually be, once the other sites are updated accordingly: <ul> <li>The regular <a href="../storage_access_api.html">Storage Access API</a> requires an active opt-in by the embedded site, so <code>site2.example.com</code> can stop calling <code>document.requestStorageAccess()</code> when it's embedded in <code>site1.example.com</code>, avoiding a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF">CSRF</a> attack.</li> <li>Use of <code>requestStorageAccessFor()</code> requires <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a>, so <code>site2.example.com</code> could choose not to respond with the appropriate CORS headers when network requests are coming from <code>site1.example.com</code>, thereby avoiding a CSRF attack.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
