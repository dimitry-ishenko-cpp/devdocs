<header><h1>RTCIceCandidateStats: address property</h1></header><div class="section-content">
<p> The <code>address</code> property of the <a href="../rtcicecandidatestats.html"><code>RTCIceCandidateStats</code></a> dictionary indicates the address of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE">ICE</a> candidate. While it's preferred that the address be specified as an IPv4 or IPv6 numeric address, a fully-qualified domain name can be used as well. </p> <p> When a domain name is specified, the first IP address selected for that address is used, even if the domain name maps to multiple IP addresses. </p>
</div>
<h2 id="value">Value</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p> Either an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a fully-qualified domain name, which corresponds to the candidate. </p> <ul> <li> If the value of <code>address</code> is comprised entirely of digits from 0-9 with periods as separators, the value is interpreted as an IPv4 address. </li> <li> If the value is entirely comprised of hexadecimal digits and colon (":") characters, it is interpreted as an IPv6 address. </li> <li> Otherwise, the <code>address</code> is presumed to be a fully-qualified domain name, which is resolved first using an AAAA record (assuming IPv6 is available), then using an A record (if no result is found or the device only supports IPv4). If multiple IP addresses are returned in response to the query, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent">user agent</a> selects one, which is then used for the duration of ICE processing. </li> </ul>

<h2 id="usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>
<div class="section-content"><p> The <code>address</code> property was previously known as <code>ip</code>, and only permitted IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to be used. The addition of support for fully-qualified domain names to be used for the address brought about the renaming of the property. </p></div>
