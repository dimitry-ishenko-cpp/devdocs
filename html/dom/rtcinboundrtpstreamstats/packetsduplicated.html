<header><h1>RTCInboundRtpStreamStats: packetsDuplicated property</h1></header><div class="section-content">
<p>The <code>packetsDuplicated</code> property of the <a href="../rtcinboundrtpstreamstats.html"><code>RTCInboundRtpStreamStats</code></a> dictionary indicates the total number of packets discarded because they were duplicates of previously-received packets.</p> <p>These packets are not counted by the <a class="page-not-created" data-href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/packetsDiscarded.html"><code>packetsDiscarded</code></a> property.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="value">Value</h2>
<div class="section-content"><p>An integer value which specifies how many duplicate packets have been received by the local end of this RTP stream so far. These duplicate packets are not included in the <a class="page-not-created" data-href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/packetsDiscarded.html"><code>packetsDiscarded</code></a> property.</p></div>
<h2 id="usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Duplicate packets are detected when a packet has the same RTP sequence number as another packet that has previously been processed. Each time a packet is repeated, the value of <code>packetsDuplicated</code> is incremented, even if the same packet is received more than twice.</p> <p>You can get a more accurate tally of how many packets have been lost on the stream by adding <code>packetsDuplicated</code> to <a class="page-not-created" data-href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/packetsLost.html"><code>packetsLost</code></a>. The resulting value will be positive, although it will not match the count as computed in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3660" target="_blank">RFC 3660</a>.</p>
