<div class="notecard nonstandard" id="sect3"><p><strong>Non-standard:</strong> This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.</p></div> <p> The read-only <code>region</code> property of the <a href="../paymentaddress.html"><code>PaymentAddress</code></a> interface returns a string containing the top-level administrative subdivision of the country in which the address is located. For example, this may be a state, province, oblast, or prefecture. </p>

<h2 id="value">Value</h2>
<div class="section-content"><p> A string specifying the top-level administrative subdivision within the country in which the address is located. This region has different names in different countries, such as: state, province, oblast, prefecture, or county. </p></div>
<h2 id="usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>
<div class="section-content"><p> In some countries, like Belgium, it's uncommon for people to provide a region as part of their postal address. In such cases, the browser returns an empty string as the value of <code>region</code>. However, the address should still be acceptable to use for its intended purpose (e.g., to ship a product). However, always verify addresses to make sure what the user provides is usable. </p></div>
