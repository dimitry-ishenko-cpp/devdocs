<div class="notecard deprecated" id="sect1"><p><strong>Deprecated:</strong> This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the <a href="#browser_compatibility">compatibility table</a> at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.</p></div>
<div class="notecard nonstandard" id="sect2"><p><strong>Non-standard:</strong> This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.</p></div> <p> The read-only <code>region</code> property of the <a href="../paymentaddress.html"><code>PaymentAddress</code></a> interface returns a string containing the top-level administrative subdivision of the country in which the address is located. For example, this may be a state, province, oblast, or prefecture. </p>

<h2 id="value">Value</h2>
<div class="section-content"><p> A string specifying the top-level administrative subdivision within the country in which the address is located. This region has different names in different countries, such as: state, province, oblast, prefecture, or county. </p></div>
<h2 id="usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>
<div class="section-content"><p> In some countries, like Belgium, it's uncommon for people to provide a region as part of their postal address. In such cases, the browser returns an empty string as the value of <code>region</code>. However, the address should still be acceptable to use for its intended purpose (e.g., to ship a product). However, always verify addresses to make sure what the user provides is usable. </p></div>
