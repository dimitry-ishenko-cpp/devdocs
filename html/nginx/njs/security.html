<h1>Security</h1>
<p> All njs security issues should be reported to <code>security-alert@nginx.org</code>. </p>
<p> Patches are signed using one of the <a href="https://nginx.org/en/pgp_keys.html">PGP public keys</a>. </p>
<h4 id="considerations">Special considerations</h4>
<p> njs does not evaluate dynamic code and especially the code received from the network in any way. The only way to evaluate that code using njs is to configure the <a href="../http/ngx_http_js_module.html#js_import">js_import</a> directive in nginx. JavaScript code is loaded once during nginx start. </p>
<p> In nginx/njs threat model, JavaScript code is considered a trusted source in the same way as <code>nginx.conf</code> and sites certificates. What this means in practice: </p> <ul class="compact"> <li> memory disclosure and other security issues triggered by JavaScript code modification are not considered security issues, but as ordinary bugs </li> <li> measures should be taking for protecting JavaScript code used by njs </li> <li> if no <a href="../http/ngx_http_js_module.html#js_import">js_import</a> directives are present in <code>nginx.conf</code>, nginx is safe from JavaScript-related vulnerabilities </li> </ul>
