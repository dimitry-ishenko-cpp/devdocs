<h1>WebSocket proxying</h1>
<p> To turn a connection between a client and server from HTTP/1.1 into WebSocket, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-14.42">protocol switch</a> mechanism available in HTTP/1.1 is used. </p>
<p> There is one subtlety however: since the “Upgrade” is a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13.5.1">hop-by-hop</a> header, it is not passed from a client to proxied server. With forward proxying, clients may use the <code>CONNECT</code> method to circumvent this issue. This does not work with reverse proxying however, since clients are not aware of any proxy servers, and special processing on a proxy server is required. </p>
<p> Since version 1.3.13, nginx implements special mode of operation that allows setting up a tunnel between a client and proxied server if the proxied server returned a response with the code 101 (Switching Protocols), and the client asked for a protocol switch via the “Upgrade” header in a request. </p>
<p> As noted above, hop-by-hop headers including “Upgrade” and “Connection” are not passed from a client to proxied server, therefore in order for the proxied server to know about the client’s intention to switch a protocol to WebSocket, these headers have to be passed explicitly: </p> <pre data-language="nginx">
location /chat/ {
    proxy_pass http://backend;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}
</pre>
<p> A more sophisticated example in which a value of the “Connection” header field in a request to the proxied server depends on the presence of the “Upgrade” field in the client request header: </p> <pre data-language="nginx">
http {
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }

    server {
        ...

        location /chat/ {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        }
    }
</pre>

<p> By default, the connection will be closed if the proxied server does not transmit any data within 60 seconds. This timeout can be increased with the <a href="ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_read_timeout">proxy_read_timeout</a> directive. Alternatively, the proxied server can be configured to periodically send WebSocket ping frames to reset the timeout and check if the connection is still alive. </p><div class="_attribution">
