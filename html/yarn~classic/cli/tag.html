<h1>33. yarn tag</h1>  <p class="lead">Add, remove, or list tags on a package.</p> <h2 id="what-are-tags-">What are tags? </h2> <p>Distribution tags (or dist-tags) are a way of marking published versions of your package with a label. Users of your package can install it using this label instead of a version number.</p> <p>For example, if you had a <strong>stable</strong> release channel and a <strong>canary</strong> release channel, you could use tags as a way to allow the user to type:</p> <pre data-language="sh">yarn add your-package-name@stable
yarn add your-package-name@canary</pre> <p>Different tags have different meanings:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>latest</code>: The current version of the package</li> <li>
<code>stable</code>: The latest stable release of the package, normally the same as latest unless you have Long-term Support (LTS)</li> <li>
<code>beta</code>: A release before becoming latest and/or stable, used to share upcoming changes before they are finished.</li> <li>
<code>canary</code>: A “nightly” or pre-beta release, if your project is frequently updated and depended on by many people you may use this to share even earlier code.</li> <li>
<code>dev</code>: Sometimes you want to be able to test out a single revision through the registry while you’re still working on things, this is useful for that.</li> </ul> <p>Some projects will make up their own tags as they see appropriate or in place of one of the more standard ones. Such as <code>next</code> which is used the same as <code>beta</code>.</p> <p>Although these are widely considered the “standard” tags, the only one that has any real meaning is <code>latest</code> which is used for determining which version to install when no version is specified.</p> <h2 id="caveats-">Caveats </h2> <p>You cannot use tags that match potential version numbers since they share a namespace:</p> <pre data-language="sh">yarn add your-package-name@&lt;version&gt;
yarn add your-package-name@&lt;tag&gt;</pre> <p>Any tag that can also be used as a valid semver range will be rejected. For example, you cannot have a tag named <code>v2.3</code> because in semver it means <code>&gt;=2.3.0 &lt;2.4.0</code>.</p> <p>In general, avoid using tags that look like versions, they typically only confuse people anyways.</p> <h2 id="commands-">Commands </h2> <h3 id="yarn-tag-add-packageversion-tag-">
<code>yarn tag add &lt;package&gt;@&lt;version&gt; &lt;tag&gt;</code> </h3> <p>Add a tag named <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> for a specific <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> of a <code>&lt;package&gt;</code>.</p> <h3 id="yarn-tag-remove-package-tag-">
<code>yarn tag remove &lt;package&gt; &lt;tag&gt;</code> </h3> <p>Remove a tag named <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> from a <code>&lt;package&gt;</code> that is no longer in use.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> You do not need to delete a tag before moving it to another version in the package. It’s better not to.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="yarn-tag-list-package-">
<code>yarn tag list [&lt;package&gt;]</code> </h3> <p>List all of the tags for a <code>&lt;package&gt;</code>. If unspecified <code>&lt;package&gt;</code> will default to the package you’re currently inside the directory of.</p><div class="_attribution">
