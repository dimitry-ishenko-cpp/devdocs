<h1>19. yarn link</h1>  <p class="lead">Symlink a package folder during development.</p> <p>For development, a package can be linked into another project. This is often useful to test out new features or when trying to debug an issue in a package that manifests itself in another project.</p> <p>There are two commands to facilitate this workflow:</p> <h3 id="yarn-link-in-package-you-want-to-link-">
<code>yarn link</code> (in package you want to link) </h3> <p>This command is run in the package folder you’d like to consume. For example if you are working on <code>react</code> and would like to use your local version to debug a problem in <code>react-relay</code>, simply run <code>yarn link</code> inside of the <code>react</code> project.</p> <h3 id="yarn-link-package"><code>yarn link [package...]</code></h3> <p>Use <code>yarn link [package]</code> to link another package that you’d like to test into your current project. To follow the above example, in the <code>react-relay</code> project, you’d run <code>yarn link react</code> to use your local version of <code>react</code> that you previously linked.</p> <p>Complete example, assuming two project folders <code>react</code> and <code>react-relay</code> next to each other:</p> <pre data-language="sh">$ cd react
$ yarn link
yarn link vx.x.x
success Registered "react".
info You can now run `yarn link "react"` in the projects where you want to use this module and it will be used instead.</pre> <pre data-language="sh">$ cd ../react-relay
$ yarn link react
yarn link vx.x.x
success Registered "react".</pre> <p>This will create a symlink named <code>react-relay/node_modules/react</code> that links to your local copy of the <code>react</code> project.</p> <p>Links are registered in <code>~/.config/yarn/link</code>. If you want to specify a different folder you can run the command with this syntax <code>yarn link --link-folder path/to/dir/</code></p> <p>To reverse this process, simply use <code>yarn unlink</code> or <code>yarn unlink [package]</code>.
