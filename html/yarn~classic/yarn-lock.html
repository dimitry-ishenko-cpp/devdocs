<h1>5. yarn.lock</h1>  <p>In order to get consistent installs across machines, Yarn needs more information than the dependencies you configure in your <code>package.json</code>. Yarn needs to store exactly which versions of each dependency were installed.</p> <p>To do this Yarn uses a <code>yarn.lock</code> file in the root of your project. These “lockfiles” look like this:</p> <pre data-language="yaml"># THIS IS AN AUTOGENERATED FILE. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
# yarn lockfile v1

It’s similar to npm’s <code>npm-shrinkwrap.json</code>, however it’s not lossy and it creates reproducible results.</p> <h2 id="managed-by-yarn-">Managed by Yarn </h2> <p>Your <code>yarn.lock</code> file is auto-generated and should be handled entirely by Yarn. As you add/upgrade/remove dependencies with the Yarn CLI, it will automatically update your <code>yarn.lock</code> file. Do not edit this file directly as it is easy to break something.</p> <h2 id="current-package-only-">Current package only </h2> <p>During install, Yarn will only use the top-level <code>yarn.lock</code> file and will ignore any <code>yarn.lock</code> files that exist within dependencies. The top-level <code>yarn.lock</code> file includes everything Yarn needs to lock the versions of all packages in the entire dependency tree.</p> <h2 id="check-into-source-control-">Check into source control </h2> <p>All <code>yarn.lock</code> files should be checked into source control (e.g. git or mercurial). This allows Yarn to install the same exact dependency tree across all machines, whether it be your coworker’s laptop or a CI server.</p> <p>Framework and library authors should also check <code>yarn.lock</code> into source control. Don’t worry about publishing the <code>yarn.lock</code> file as it won’t have any effect on users of the library.</p> <p>See <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/11/24/lockfiles-for-all/">https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/11/24/lockfiles-for-all/</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
