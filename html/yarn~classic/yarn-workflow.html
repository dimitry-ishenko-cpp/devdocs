<h1>1. The Yarn Workflow</h1>  <p>Introducing a package manager into your project introduces a new workflow around dependencies. Yarn tries its best to stay out of your way and make each step of this workflow simple to understand.</p> <p>There are a few things you should know about the basic workflow:</p> <ol> <li>Creating a new project</li> <li>Adding/updating/removing dependencies</li> <li>Installing/reinstalling your dependencies</li> <li>Working with version control (e.g. git)</li> <li>Continuous Integration</li> </ol><div class="_attribution">
