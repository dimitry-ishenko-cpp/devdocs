<h1>2. Types of dependencies</h1>  <p>Dependencies serve many different purposes. Some dependencies are needed to build your project, others are needed when you’re running your program. As such there are a number of different types of dependencies that you can have (e.g. <code>dependencies</code>, <code>devDependencies</code>, and <code>peerDependencies</code>).</p> <p>Your <code>package.json</code> will contain all of these dependencies:</p> <pre data-language="json">{
  "name": "my-project",
  "dependencies": {
    "package-a": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "package-b": "^1.2.1"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "package-c": "^2.5.4"
  },
  "optionalDependencies": {
    "package-d": "^3.1.0"
  }
}</pre> <p>Most people only have <code>dependencies</code> and <code>devDependencies</code>, but each of these are important to understand.</p> <h3 id="dependencies-">
<code>dependencies</code> </h3> <p>These are your normal dependencies, or rather ones that you need when running your code (e.g. React or ImmutableJS).</p> <h3 id="devdependencies-">
<code>devDependencies</code> </h3> <p>These are your development dependencies. Dependencies that you need at some point in the development workflow but not while running your code (e.g. Babel or Flow).</p> <h3 id="peerdependencies-">
<code>peerDependencies</code> </h3> <p>Peer dependencies are a special type of dependency that would only ever come up if you were publishing your own package.</p> <p>Having a peer dependency means that your package needs a dependency that is the same exact dependency as the person installing your package. This is useful for packages like <code>react</code> that need to have a single copy of <code>react-dom</code> that is also used by the person installing it.</p> <h3 id="optionaldependencies-">
<code>optionalDependencies</code> </h3> <p>Optional dependencies are just that: optional. If they fail to install, Yarn will still say the install process was successful.</p> <p>This is useful for dependencies that won’t necessarily work on every machine and you have a fallback plan in case they are not installed (e.g. Watchman).</p> <h3 id="bundleddependencies-">
<code>bundledDependencies</code> </h3> <p>Array of package names that will be bundled when publishing the package.</p> <p>Bundled dependencies should be inside your project. The functionality is basically the same as normal dependencies. They will also be packed when running <code>yarn pack</code>.</p> <p>Normal dependencies are usually installed from the npm registry. Bundled dependencies are useful in cases normal dependencies are not sufficient:</p> <ul> <li>When you want to re-use a third party library that doesn’t come from the npm registry or that was modified.</li> <li>When you want to re-use your own projects as modules.</li> <li>When you want to distribute some files with your module.</li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
