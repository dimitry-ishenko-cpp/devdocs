<h1>State: A Component's Memory
</h1>
<div><p>Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called <em>state</em>.</p></div> <div class="note">

</h3> <p>In React, <code dir="ltr">useState</code>, as well as any other function starting with “<code dir="ltr">use</code>”, is called a Hook.</p> <p><em>Hooks</em> are special functions that are only available while React is <a href="render-and-commit.html#step-1-trigger-a-render">rendering</a> (which we’ll get into in more detail on the next page). They let you “hook into” different React features.</p> <p>State is just one of those features, but you will meet the other Hooks later.</p> <div class="note note-orange">
<h4>Pitfall</h4>
<div><p><strong>Hooks—functions starting with <code dir="ltr">use</code>—can only be called at the top level of your components or <a href="reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.html">your own Hooks.</a></strong> You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it’s helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component’s needs. You “use” React features at the top of your component similar to how you “import” modules at the top of your file.</p></div>
</div> <h3 id="anatomy-of-usestate">Anatomy of <code dir="ltr">useState</code> 
</h3> <p>When you call <a href="../reference/react/usestate.html"><code dir="ltr">useState</code></a>, you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>index</span><span>,</span> <span>setIndex</span><span>]</span> = <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre> <p>In this case, you want React to remember <code dir="ltr">index</code>.</p> <div class="note note-green">
<h4>Note</h4>
<div><p>The convention is to name this pair like <code dir="ltr">const [something, setSomething]</code>. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.</p></div>
</div> <p>The only argument to <code dir="ltr">useState</code> is the <strong>initial value</strong> of your state variable. In this example, the <code dir="ltr">index</code>’s initial value is set to <code dir="ltr">0</code> with <code dir="ltr">useState(0)</code>.</p> <p>Every time your component renders, <code dir="ltr">useState</code> gives you an array containing two values:</p> <ol> <li>The <strong>state variable</strong> (<code dir="ltr">index</code>) with the value you stored.</li> <li>The <strong>state setter function</strong> (<code dir="ltr">setIndex</code>) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.</li> </ol> <p>Here’s how that happens in action:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>index</span><span>,</span> <span>setIndex</span><span>]</span> = <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre> <ol> <li>
<strong>Your component renders the first time.</strong> Because you passed <code dir="ltr">0</code> to <code dir="ltr">useState</code> as the initial value for <code dir="ltr">index</code>, it will return <code dir="ltr">[0, setIndex]</code>. React remembers <code dir="ltr">0</code> is the latest state value.</li> <li>
<strong>You update the state.</strong> When a user clicks the button, it calls <code dir="ltr">setIndex(index + 1)</code>. <code dir="ltr">index</code> is <code dir="ltr">0</code>, so it’s <code dir="ltr">setIndex(1)</code>. This tells React to remember <code dir="ltr">index</code> is <code dir="ltr">1</code> now and triggers another render.</li> <li>
<strong>Your component’s second render.</strong> React still sees <code dir="ltr">useState(0)</code>, but because React <em>remembers</em> that you set <code dir="ltr">index</code> to <code dir="ltr">1</code>, it returns <code dir="ltr">[1, setIndex]</code> instead.</li> <li>And so on!</li> </ol> <h2 id="giving-a-component-multiple-state-variables">Giving a component multiple state variables

</pre> <p>It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like <code dir="ltr">index</code> and <code dir="ltr">showMore</code> in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it’s more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read <a href="choosing-the-state-structure.html">Choosing the State Structure</a> for more tips.</p> <details class="note note-blue"><summary tabindex="-1"><h5>
Deep Dive</h5>
<h4 id="how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return">How does React know which state to return? 
</h4></summary><div>
<p>You might have noticed that the <code dir="ltr">useState</code> call does not receive any information about <em>which</em> state variable it refers to. There is no “identifier” that is passed to <code dir="ltr">useState</code>, so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no.</p>
<p>Instead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks <strong>rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component.</strong> This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above (“only call Hooks at the top level”), Hooks will always be called in the same order. Additionally, a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">linter plugin</a> catches most mistakes.</p>
<p>Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to <code dir="ltr">0</code> before rendering. Each time you call <code dir="ltr">useState</code>, React gives you the next state pair and increments the index. You can read more about this mechanism in <a href="https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React Hooks: Not Magic, Just Arrays.</a></p>

<pre data-language="jsx"><span>let</span> <span>componentHooks</span> = <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

</pre>
<p>You don’t have to understand it to use React, but you might find this a helpful mental model.</p>
</div></details> <h2 id="state-is-isolated-and-private">State is isolated and private 
</h2> <p>State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, <strong>if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!</strong> Changing one of them will not affect the other.</p> <p>In this example, the <code dir="ltr">Gallery</code> component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:</p> 
<pre data-language="jsx"><span>import</span> <span>Gallery</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./Gallery.js'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>"Page"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>Gallery</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>Gallery</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

</pre> <p>This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it’s “local” to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two <code dir="ltr">&lt;Gallery /&gt;</code> components, so their state is stored separately.</p> <p>Also notice how the <code dir="ltr">Page</code> component doesn’t “know” anything about the <code dir="ltr">Gallery</code> state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, <strong>state is fully private to the component declaring it.</strong> The parent component can’t change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.</p> <p>What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to <em>remove</em> state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in <a href="sharing-state-between-components.html">Sharing State Between Components.</a></p> <section><h2 id="recap">Recap
</h2>
<ul> <li>Use a state variable when a component needs to “remember” some information between renders.</li> <li>State variables are declared by calling the <code dir="ltr">useState</code> Hook.</li> <li>Hooks are special functions that start with <code dir="ltr">use</code>. They let you “hook into” React features like state.</li> <li>Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including <code dir="ltr">useState</code>, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.</li> <li>The <code dir="ltr">useState</code> Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.</li> <li>You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.</li> <li>State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.</li> </ul></section> <div class="note">

<p>When you press “Next” on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible.</p>
<p>After fixing the crash, add a “Previous” button that shows the previous sculpture. It shouldn’t crash on the first sculpture.</p>
