<h1>Separating Events from Effects
</h1>
<div><p>Event handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if some value they read, like a prop or a state variable, is different from what it was during the last render. Sometimes, you also want a mix of both behaviors: an Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others. This page will teach you how to do that.</p></div> <div class="note">

</div> <h2 id="choosing-between-event-handlers-and-effects">Choosing between event handlers and Effects 
</h2> <p>First, let’s recap the difference between event handlers and Effects.</p> <p>Imagine you’re implementing a chat room component. Your requirements look like this:</p> <ol> <li>Your component should automatically connect to the selected chat room.</li> <li>When you click the “Send” button, it should send a message to the chat.</li> </ol> <p>Let’s say you’ve already implemented the code for them, but you’re not sure where to put it. Should you use event handlers or Effects? Every time you need to answer this question, consider <a href="synchronizing-with-effects.html#what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events"><em>why</em> the code needs to run.</a></p> <h3 id="event-handlers-run-in-response-to-specific-interactions">Event handlers run in response to specific interactions 
</h3> <p>From the user’s perspective, sending a message should happen <em>because</em> the particular “Send” button was clicked. The user will get rather upset if you send their message at any other time or for any other reason. This is why sending a message should be an event handler. Event handlers let you handle specific interactions:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>message</span><span>,</span> <span>setMessage</span><span>]</span> = <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>function</span> <span>handleSendClick</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>sendMessage</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> <span>value</span>=<span>{</span><span>message</span><span>}</span> <span>onChange</span>=<span>{</span><span>e</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setMessage</span><span>(</span><span>e</span>.<span>target</span>.<span>value</span><span>)</span><span>}</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>button</span> <span>onClick</span>=<span>{</span><span>handleSendClick</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>Send<span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>With an event handler, you can be sure that <code dir="ltr">sendMessage(message)</code> will <em>only</em> run if the user presses the button.</p> <h3 id="effects-run-whenever-synchronization-is-needed">Effects run whenever synchronization is needed 
</h3> <p>Recall that you also need to keep the component connected to the chat room. Where does that code go?</p> <p>The <em>reason</em> to run this code is not some particular interaction. It doesn’t matter why or how the user navigated to the chat room screen. Now that they’re looking at it and could interact with it, the component needs to stay connected to the selected chat server. Even if the chat room component was the initial screen of your app, and the user has not performed any interactions at all, you would <em>still</em> need to connect. This is why it’s an Effect:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>connection</span> = <span>createConnection</span><span>(</span><span>serverUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>roomId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>connection</span>.<span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>connection</span>.<span>disconnect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>roomId</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>With this code, you can be sure that there is always an active connection to the currently selected chat server, <em>regardless</em> of the specific interactions performed by the user. Whether the user has only opened your app, selected a different room, or navigated to another screen and back, your Effect ensures that the component will <em>remain synchronized</em> with the currently selected room, and will <a href="lifecycle-of-reactive-effects.html#why-synchronization-may-need-to-happen-more-than-once">re-connect whenever it’s necessary.</a></p>

</pre> <h2 id="reactive-values-and-reactive-logic">Reactive values and reactive logic 
</h2> <p>Intuitively, you could say that event handlers are always triggered “manually”, for example by clicking a button. Effects, on the other hand, are “automatic”: they run and re-run as often as it’s needed to stay synchronized.</p> <p>There is a more precise way to think about this.</p> <p>Props, state, and variables declared inside your component’s body are called <span data-step="2">reactive values</span>. In this example, <code dir="ltr">serverUrl</code> is not a reactive value, but <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> and <code dir="ltr">message</code> are. They participate in the rendering data flow:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>const</span> <span>serverUrl</span> = <span>'https://localhost:1234'</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>message</span><span>,</span> <span>setMessage</span><span>]</span> = <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>Reactive values like these can change due to a re-render. For example, the user may edit the <code dir="ltr">message</code> or choose a different <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> in a dropdown. Event handlers and Effects respond to changes differently:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Logic inside event handlers is <em>not reactive.</em></strong> It will not run again unless the user performs the same interaction (e.g. a click) again. Event handlers can read reactive values without “reacting” to their changes.</li> <li>
<strong>Logic inside Effects is <em>reactive.</em></strong> If your Effect reads a reactive value, <a href="lifecycle-of-reactive-effects.html#effects-react-to-reactive-values">you have to specify it as a dependency.</a> Then, if a re-render causes that value to change, React will re-run your Effect’s logic with the new value.</li> </ul> <p>Let’s revisit the previous example to illustrate this difference.</p> <h3 id="logic-inside-event-handlers-is-not-reactive">Logic inside event handlers is not reactive 
</h3> <p>Take a look at this line of code. Should this logic be reactive or not?</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code>    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>sendMessage</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ...</span></code></pre> <p>From the user’s perspective, <strong>a change to the <code dir="ltr">message</code> does <em>not</em> mean that they want to send a message.</strong> It only means that the user is typing. In other words, the logic that sends a message should not be reactive. It should not run again only because the <span data-step="2">reactive value</span> has changed. That’s why it belongs in the event handler:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code>  <span>function</span> <span>handleSendClick</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>sendMessage</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre> <p>Event handlers aren’t reactive, so <code dir="ltr">sendMessage(message)</code> will only run when the user clicks the Send button.</p> <h3 id="logic-inside-effects-is-reactive">Logic inside Effects is reactive 
</h3> <p>Now let’s return to these lines:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code>    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>connection</span> = <span>createConnection</span><span>(</span><span>serverUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>roomId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>connection</span>.<span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ...</span></code></pre> <p>From the user’s perspective, <strong>a change to the <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> <em>does</em> mean that they want to connect to a different room.</strong> In other words, the logic for connecting to the room should be reactive. You <em>want</em> these lines of code to “keep up” with the <span data-step="2">reactive value</span>, and to run again if that value is different. That’s why it belongs in an Effect:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code>  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>connection</span> = <span>createConnection</span><span>(</span><span>serverUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>roomId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>roomId</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre> <p>Effects are reactive, so <code dir="ltr">createConnection(serverUrl, roomId)</code> and <code dir="ltr">connection.connect()</code> will run for every distinct value of <code dir="ltr">roomId</code>. Your Effect keeps the chat connection synchronized to the currently selected room.</p> <h2 id="extracting-non-reactive-logic-out-of-effects">Extracting non-reactive logic out of Effects 
</h2> <p>Things get more tricky when you want to mix reactive logic with non-reactive logic.</p> <p>For example, imagine that you want to show a notification when the user connects to the chat. You read the current theme (dark or light) from the props so that you can show the notification in the correct color:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span><span>,</span> <span>theme</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>const</span> <span>connection</span> = <span>createConnection</span><span>(</span><span>serverUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>roomId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>connection</span>.<span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ...</span></code></pre> <p>However, <code dir="ltr">theme</code> is a reactive value (it can change as a result of re-rendering), and <a href="lifecycle-of-reactive-effects.html#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency">every reactive value read by an Effect must be declared as its dependency.</a> Now you have to specify <code dir="ltr">theme</code> as a dependency of your Effect:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span><span>,</span> <span>theme</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

</pre> <p>You can think of Effect Events as being very similar to event handlers. The main difference is that event handlers run in response to a user interactions, whereas Effect Events are triggered by you from Effects. Effect Events let you “break the chain” between the reactivity of Effects and code that should not be reactive.</p> <h3 id="reading-latest-props-and-state-with-effect-events">Reading latest props and state with Effect Events

<h4>Under Construction</h4>
<div><p>This section describes an <strong>experimental API that has not yet been released</strong> in a stable version of React.</p></div>
</div> <p>Effect Events let you fix many patterns where you might be tempted to suppress the dependency linter.</p> <p>For example, say you have an Effect to log the page visits:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>logVisit</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>Later, you add multiple routes to your site. Now your <code dir="ltr">Page</code> component receives a <code dir="ltr">url</code> prop with the current path. You want to pass the <code dir="ltr">url</code> as a part of your <code dir="ltr">logVisit</code> call, but the dependency linter complains:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>url</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>logVisit</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'url'</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>Think about what you want the code to do. You <em>want</em> to log a separate visit for different URLs since each URL represents a different page. In other words, this <code dir="ltr">logVisit</code> call <em>should</em> be reactive with respect to the <code dir="ltr">url</code>. This is why, in this case, it makes sense to follow the dependency linter, and add <code dir="ltr">url</code> as a dependency:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>url</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>logVisit</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// ✅ All dependencies declared</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>Now let’s say you want to include the number of items in the shopping cart together with every page visit:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>url</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>items</span> <span>}</span> = <span>useContext</span><span>(</span><span>ShoppingCartContext</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>numberOfItems</span> = <span>items</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>logVisit</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>numberOfItems</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'numberOfItems'</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>You used <code dir="ltr">numberOfItems</code> inside the Effect, so the linter asks you to add it as a dependency. However, you <em>don’t</em> want the <code dir="ltr">logVisit</code> call to be reactive with respect to <code dir="ltr">numberOfItems</code>. If the user puts something into the shopping cart, and the <code dir="ltr">numberOfItems</code> changes, this <em>does not mean</em> that the user visited the page again. In other words, <em>visiting the page</em> is, in some sense, an “event”. It happens at a precise moment in time.</p> <p>Split the code in two parts:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>url</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>items</span> <span>}</span> = <span>useContext</span><span>(</span><span>ShoppingCartContext</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>numberOfItems</span> = <span>items</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onVisit</span> = <span>useEffectEvent</span><span>(</span><span>visitedUrl</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>logVisit</span><span>(</span><span>visitedUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>numberOfItems</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>onVisit</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// ✅ All dependencies declared</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>Here, <code dir="ltr">onVisit</code> is an Effect Event. The code inside it isn’t reactive. This is why you can use <code dir="ltr">numberOfItems</code> (or any other reactive value!) without worrying that it will cause the surrounding code to re-execute on changes.</p> <p>On the other hand, the Effect itself remains reactive. Code inside the Effect uses the <code dir="ltr">url</code> prop, so the Effect will re-run after every re-render with a different <code dir="ltr">url</code>. This, in turn, will call the <code dir="ltr">onVisit</code> Effect Event.</p> <p>As a result, you will call <code dir="ltr">logVisit</code> for every change to the <code dir="ltr">url</code>, and always read the latest <code dir="ltr">numberOfItems</code>. However, if <code dir="ltr">numberOfItems</code> changes on its own, this will not cause any of the code to re-run.</p> <div class="note note-green">
<h4>Note</h4>
<div>
<p>You might be wondering if you could call <code dir="ltr">onVisit()</code> with no arguments, and read the <code dir="ltr">url</code> inside it:</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code>  <span>const</span> <span>onVisit</span> = <span>useEffectEvent</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>logVisit</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>numberOfItems</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>onVisit</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>This would work, but it’s better to pass this <code dir="ltr">url</code> to the Effect Event explicitly. <strong>By passing <code dir="ltr">url</code> as an argument to your Effect Event, you are saying that visiting a page with a different <code dir="ltr">url</code> constitutes a separate “event” from the user’s perspective.</strong> The <code dir="ltr">visitedUrl</code> is a <em>part</em> of the “event” that happened:</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code>  <span>const</span> <span>onVisit</span> = <span>useEffectEvent</span><span>(</span><span>visitedUrl</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>logVisit</span><span>(</span><span>visitedUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>numberOfItems</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>onVisit</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Since your Effect Event explicitly “asks” for the <code dir="ltr">visitedUrl</code>, now you can’t accidentally remove <code dir="ltr">url</code> from the Effect’s dependencies. If you remove the <code dir="ltr">url</code> dependency (causing distinct page visits to be counted as one), the linter will warn you about it. You want <code dir="ltr">onVisit</code> to be reactive with regards to the <code dir="ltr">url</code>, so instead of reading the <code dir="ltr">url</code> inside (where it wouldn’t be reactive), you pass it <em>from</em> your Effect.</p>
<p>This becomes especially important if there is some asynchronous logic inside the Effect:</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code>  <span>const</span> <span>onVisit</span> = <span>useEffectEvent</span><span>(</span><span>visitedUrl</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>logVisit</span><span>(</span><span>visitedUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>numberOfItems</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>onVisit</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>5000</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Delay logging visits</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, <code dir="ltr">url</code> inside <code dir="ltr">onVisit</code> corresponds to the <em>latest</em> <code dir="ltr">url</code> (which could have already changed), but <code dir="ltr">visitedUrl</code> corresponds to the <code dir="ltr">url</code> that originally caused this Effect (and this <code dir="ltr">onVisit</code> call) to run.</p>

<p>In the existing codebases, you may sometimes see the lint rule suppressed like this:</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>url</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>items</span> <span>}</span> = <span>useContext</span><span>(</span><span>ShoppingCartContext</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>numberOfItems</span> = <span>items</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>logVisit</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>numberOfItems</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:</span>
    <span>// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>After <code dir="ltr">useEffectEvent</code> becomes a stable part of React, we recommend <strong>never suppressing the linter</strong>.</p>
<p>The first downside of suppressing the rule is that React will no longer warn you when your Effect needs to “react” to a new reactive dependency you’ve introduced to your code. In the earlier example, you added <code dir="ltr">url</code> to the dependencies <em>because</em> React reminded you to do it. You will no longer get such reminders for any future edits to that Effect if you disable the linter. This leads to bugs.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a confusing bug caused by suppressing the linter. In this example, the <code dir="ltr">handleMove</code> function is supposed to read the current <code dir="ltr">canMove</code> state variable value in order to decide whether the dot should follow the cursor. However, <code dir="ltr">canMove</code> is always <code dir="ltr">true</code> inside <code dir="ltr">handleMove</code>.</p>
<p>Can you see why?</p>

<p>The problem with this code is in suppressing the dependency linter. If you remove the suppression, you’ll see that this Effect should depend on the <code dir="ltr">handleMove</code> function. This makes sense: <code dir="ltr">handleMove</code> is declared inside the component body, which makes it a reactive value. Every reactive value must be specified as a dependency, or it can potentially get stale over time!</p>
<p>The author of the original code has “lied” to React by saying that the Effect does not depend (<code dir="ltr">[]</code>) on any reactive values. This is why React did not re-synchronize the Effect after <code dir="ltr">canMove</code> has changed (and <code dir="ltr">handleMove</code> with it). Because React did not re-synchronize the Effect, the <code dir="ltr">handleMove</code> attached as a listener is the <code dir="ltr">handleMove</code> function created during the initial render. During the initial render, <code dir="ltr">canMove</code> was <code dir="ltr">true</code>, which is why <code dir="ltr">handleMove</code> from the initial render will forever see that value.</p>
<p><strong>If you never suppress the linter, you will never see problems with stale values.</strong></p>
<p>With <code dir="ltr">useEffectEvent</code>, there is no need to “lie” to the linter, and the code works as you would expect:</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that <code dir="ltr">useEffectEvent</code> is <em>always</em> the correct solution. You should only apply it to the lines of code that you don’t want to be reactive. In the above sandbox, you didn’t want the Effect’s code to be reactive with regards to <code dir="ltr">canMove</code>. That’s why it made sense to extract an Effect Event.</p>

</div>Fix a variable that doesn’t update

<p>This <code dir="ltr">Timer</code> component keeps a <code dir="ltr">count</code> state variable which increases every second. The value by which it’s increasing is stored in the <code dir="ltr">increment</code> state variable. You can control the <code dir="ltr">increment</code> variable with the plus and minus buttons.</p>
<p>However, no matter how many times you click the plus button, the counter is still incremented by one every second. What’s wrong with this code? Why is <code dir="ltr">increment</code> always equal to <code dir="ltr">1</code> inside the Effect’s code? Find the mistake and fix it.</p>
