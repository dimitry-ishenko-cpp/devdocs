<p>React Compiler is a new compiler currently in Beta, that we’ve open sourced to get early feedback from the community. While it has been used in production at companies like Meta, rolling out the compiler to production for your app will depend on the health of your codebase and how well you’ve followed the <a href="../reference/rules.html">Rules of React</a>.</p>
<p>The latest Beta release can be found with the <code dir="ltr">@beta</code> tag, and daily experimental releases with <code dir="ltr">@experimental</code>.</p>

</div> <p>React Compiler is a new compiler that we’ve open sourced to get early feedback from the community. It is a build-time only tool that automatically optimizes your React app. It works with plain JavaScript, and understands the <a href="../reference/rules.html">Rules of React</a>, so you don’t need to rewrite any code to use it.</p> <p>The compiler also includes an <a href="#installing-eslint-plugin-react-compiler">ESLint plugin</a> that surfaces the analysis from the compiler right in your editor. <strong>We strongly recommend everyone use the linter today.</strong> The linter does not require that you have the compiler installed, so you can use it even if you are not ready to try out the compiler.</p> <p>The compiler is currently released as <code dir="ltr">beta</code>, and is available to try out on React 17+ apps and libraries. To install the Beta:</p> <div>
 Terminal</div>
npm install -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@beta eslint-plugin-react-compiler@beta <p>Or, if you’re using Yarn:</p> <div>
 Terminal</div>
yarn add -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@beta eslint-plugin-react-compiler@beta <p>If you are not using React 19 yet, please see <a href="#using-react-compiler-with-react-17-or-18">the section below</a> for further instructions.</p> <h3 id="what-does-the-compiler-do">What does the compiler do? 
</h3> <p>In order to optimize applications, React Compiler automatically memoizes your code. You may be familiar today with memoization through APIs such as <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code>, <code dir="ltr">useCallback</code>, and <code dir="ltr">React.memo</code>. With these APIs you can tell React that certain parts of your application don’t need to recompute if their inputs haven’t changed, reducing work on updates. While powerful, it’s easy to forget to apply memoization or apply them incorrectly. This can lead to inefficient updates as React has to check parts of your UI that don’t have any <em>meaningful</em> changes.</p> <p>The compiler uses its knowledge of JavaScript and React’s rules to automatically memoize values or groups of values within your components and hooks. If it detects breakages of the rules, it will automatically skip over just those components or hooks, and continue safely compiling other code.</p> <div class="note note-green">
<h4>Note</h4>
<div><p>React Compiler can statically detect when Rules of React are broken, and safely opt-out of optimizing just the affected components or hooks. It is not necessary for the compiler to optimize 100% of your codebase.</p></div>
</div> <p>If your codebase is already very well-memoized, you might not expect to see major performance improvements with the compiler. However, in practice memoizing the correct dependencies that cause performance issues is tricky to get right by hand.</p> <details class="note note-blue"><summary tabindex="-1"><h5>
Deep Dive</h5>
<h4 id="what-kind-of-memoization-does-react-compiler-add">What kind of memoization does React Compiler add? 
</h4></summary><div>
<p>The initial release of React Compiler is primarily focused on <strong>improving update performance</strong> (re-rendering existing components), so it focuses on these two use cases:</p>
<ol> <li>
<strong>Skipping cascading re-rendering of components</strong> <ul> <li>Re-rendering <code dir="ltr">&lt;Parent /&gt;</code> causes many components in its component tree to re-render, even though only <code dir="ltr">&lt;Parent /&gt;</code> has changed</li> </ul> </li> <li>
<strong>Skipping expensive calculations from outside of React</strong> <ul> <li>For example, calling <code dir="ltr">expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects()</code> inside of your component or hook that needs that data</li> </ul> </li> </ol>
<h4 id="optimizing-re-renders">Optimizing Re-renders 
</h4>
<p>React lets you express your UI as a function of their current state (more concretely: their props, state, and context). In its current implementation, when a component’s state changes, React will re-render that component <em>and all of its children</em> — unless you have applied some form of manual memoization with <code dir="ltr">useMemo()</code>, <code dir="ltr">useCallback()</code>, or <code dir="ltr">React.memo()</code>. For example, in the following example, <code dir="ltr">&lt;MessageButton&gt;</code> will re-render whenever <code dir="ltr">&lt;FriendList&gt;</code>’s state changes:</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>FriendList</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>friends</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>onlineCount</span> = <span>useFriendOnlineCount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>friends</span>.<span>length</span> === <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>NoFriends</span> <span>/&gt;</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>onlineCount</span><span>}</span> online<span>&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>{</span><span>friends</span>.<span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>friend</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>&lt;</span><span>FriendListCard</span> <span>key</span>=<span>{</span><span>friend</span>.<span>id</span><span>}</span> <span>friend</span>=<span>{</span><span>friend</span><span>}</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>)</span><span>)</span><span>}</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>MessageButton</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhAMygOzgFwJYSYAEAYjHgpgCYAyeYOAFMEWuZVWEQL4CURwADrEicQgyKEANnkwIAwtEw4iAXiJQwCMhWoB5TDLmKsTXgG5hRInjRFGbXZwB0UygHMcACzWr1ABn4hEWsYBBxYYgAeADkIHQ4uAHoAPksRbisiMIiYYkYs6yiqPAA3FMLrIiiwAAcAQ0wU4GlZBSUcbklDNqikusaKkKrgR0TnAFt62sYHdmp+VRT7SqrqhOo6Bnl6mCoiAGsEAE9VUfmqZzwqLrHqM7ubolTVol5eTOGigFkEMDB6u4EAAhKA4HCEZ5DNZ9ErlLIWYTcEDcIA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>See this example in the React Compiler Playground</em></a></p>
<p>React Compiler automatically applies the equivalent of manual memoization, ensuring that only the relevant parts of an app re-render as state changes, which is sometimes referred to as “fine-grained reactivity”. In the above example, React Compiler determines that the return value of <code dir="ltr">&lt;FriendListCard /&gt;</code> can be reused even as <code dir="ltr">friends</code> changes, and can avoid recreating this JSX <em>and</em> avoid re-rendering <code dir="ltr">&lt;MessageButton&gt;</code> as the count changes.</p>
<h4 id="expensive-calculations-also-get-memoized">Expensive calculations also get memoized 
</h4>
<p>The compiler can also automatically memoize for expensive calculations used during rendering:</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>// **Not** memoized by React Compiler, since this is not a component or hook</span>
<span>function</span> <span>expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* ... */</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// Memoized by React Compiler since this is a component</span>
<span>function</span> <span>TableContainer</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>items</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// This function call would be memoized:</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>data</span> = <span>expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhAejQAgFTYHIQAuumAtgqRAJYBeCAJpgEYCemASggIZyGYDCEUgAcqAGwQwANJjBUAdokyEAFlTCZ1meUUxdMcIcIjyE8vhBiYVECAGsAOvIBmURYSonMCAB7CzcgBuCGIsAAowEIhgYACCnFxioQAyXDAA5gixMDBcLADyzvlMAFYIvGAAFACUmMCYaNiYAHStOFgAvk5OGJgAshTUdIysHNy8AkbikrIKSqpaWvqGIiZmhE6u7p7ymAAqXEwSguZcCpKV9VSEFBodtcBOmAYmYHz0XIT6ALzefgFUYKhCJRBAxeLcJIsVIZLI5PKFYplCqVa63aoAbm6u0wMAQhFguwAPPRAQA+YAfL4dIloUmBMlODogDpAA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>See this example in the React Compiler Playground</em></a></p>
<p>However, if <code dir="ltr">expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects</code> is truly an expensive function, you may want to consider implementing its own memoization outside of React, because:</p>
<ul> <li>React Compiler only memoizes React components and hooks, not every function</li> <li>React Compiler’s memoization is not shared across multiple components or hooks</li> </ul>
<p>So if <code dir="ltr">expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects</code> was used in many different components, even if the same exact items were passed down, that expensive calculation would be run repeatedly. We recommend <a href="../reference/react/usememo.html#how-to-tell-if-a-calculation-is-expensive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">profiling</a> first to see if it really is that expensive before making code more complicated.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>
<div><p><strong>You don’t have to fix all ESLint violations straight away.</strong> You can address them at your own pace to increase the amount of components and hooks being optimized, but it is not required to fix everything before you can use the compiler.</p></div>
</div> <h3 id="using-the-compiler-effectively">Rolling out the compiler to your codebase 
</h3> <h4 id="existing-projects">Existing projects 
</h4> <p>The compiler is designed to compile functional components and hooks that follow the <a href="../reference/rules.html">Rules of React</a>. It can also handle code that breaks those rules by bailing out (skipping over) those components or hooks. However, due to the flexible nature of JavaScript, the compiler cannot catch every possible violation and may compile with false negatives: that is, the compiler may accidentally compile a component/hook that breaks the Rules of React which can lead to undefined behavior.</p> <p>For this reason, to adopt the compiler successfully on existing projects, we recommend running it on a small directory in your product code first. You can do this by configuring the compiler to only run on a specific set of directories:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>const</span> <span>ReactCompilerConfig</span> = <span>{</span>
  <span>sources</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre> <p>When you have more confidence with rolling out the compiler, you can expand coverage to other directories as well and slowly roll it out to your whole app.</p> <h4 id="new-projects">New projects

</h3> <p>React Compiler works best with React 19 RC. If you are unable to upgrade, you can install the extra <code dir="ltr">react-compiler-runtime</code> package which will allow the compiled code to run on versions prior to 19. However, note that the minimum supported version is 17.</p> <div>
 Terminal</div>
npm install react-compiler-runtime@beta <p>You should also add the correct <code dir="ltr">target</code> to your compiler config, where <code dir="ltr">target</code> is the major version of React you are targeting:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>// babel.config.js</span>

<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre> <h3 id="using-the-compiler-on-libraries">Using the compiler on libraries 
</h3> <p>React Compiler can also be used to compile libraries. Because React Compiler needs to run on the original source code prior to any code transformations, it is not possible for an application’s build pipeline to compile the libraries they use. Hence, our recommendation is for library maintainers to independently compile and test their libraries with the compiler, and ship compiled code to npm.</p> <p>Because your code is pre-compiled, users of your library will not need to have the compiler enabled in order to benefit from the automatic memoization applied to your library. If your library targets apps not yet on React 19, specify a minimum <a href="#using-react-compiler-with-react-17-or-18"><code dir="ltr">target</code> and add <code dir="ltr">react-compiler-runtime</code> as a direct dependency</a>. The runtime package will use the correct implementation of APIs depending on the application’s version, and polyfill the missing APIs if necessary.</p> <p>Library code can often require more complex patterns and usage of escape hatches. For this reason, we recommend ensuring that you have sufficient testing in order to identify any issues that might arise from using the compiler on your library. If you identify any issues, you can always opt-out the specific components or hooks with the <a href="#something-is-not-working-after-compilation"><code dir="ltr">'use no memo'</code> directive</a>.</p> <p>Similarly to apps, it is not necessary to fully compile 100% of your components or hooks to see benefits in your library. A good starting point might be to identify the most performance sensitive parts of your library and ensuring that they don’t break the <a href="../reference/rules.html">Rules of React</a>, which you can use <code dir="ltr">eslint-plugin-react-compiler</code> to identify.</p> <h2 id="installation">Usage

To confirm this, try to make the issue go away by aggressively opting out any component or hook you think might be related via the <a href="#opt-out-of-the-compiler-for-a-component"><code dir="ltr">"use no memo"</code> directive</a>.</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>SuspiciousComponent</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"use no memo"</span><span>;</span> <span>// opts out this component from being compiled by React Compiler</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <div class="note note-green">
<h4>Note</h4>
<div>
<h4 id="use-no-memo">
<code dir="ltr">"use no memo"</code> 
</h4>
<p><code dir="ltr">"use no memo"</code> is a <em>temporary</em> escape hatch that lets you opt-out components and hooks from being compiled by the React Compiler. This directive is not meant to be long lived the same way as eg <a href="../reference/rsc/use-client.html"><code dir="ltr">"use client"</code></a> is.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to reach for this directive unless it’s strictly necessary. Once you opt-out a component or hook, it is opted-out forever until the directive is removed. This means that even if you fix the code, the compiler will still skip over compiling it unless you remove the directive.</p>
</div>
</div> <p>When you make the error go away, confirm that removing the opt out directive makes the issue come back. Then share a bug report with us (you can try to reduce it to a small repro, or if it’s open source code you can also just paste the entire source) using the <a href="https://playground.react.dev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React Compiler Playground</a> so we can identify and help fix the issue.</p> <h3 id="other-issues">Other issues
