<h1>Lifecycle of Reactive Effects
</h1>
<div><p>Effects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your Effect depends on props and state that change over time. React provides a linter rule to check that you’ve specified your Effect’s dependencies correctly. This keeps your Effect synchronized to the latest props and state.</p></div> <div class="note">
<h4>You will learn</h4>
<ul> <li>How an Effect’s lifecycle is different from a component’s lifecycle</li> <li>How to think about each individual Effect in isolation</li> <li>When your Effect needs to re-synchronize, and why</li> <li>How your Effect’s dependencies are determined</li> <li>What it means for a value to be reactive</li> <li>What an empty dependency array means</li> <li>How React verifies your dependencies are correct with a linter</li> <li>What to do when you disagree with the linter</li> </ul>
</div> <h2 id="the-lifecycle-of-an-effect">The lifecycle of an Effect 
</h2> <p>Every React component goes through the same lifecycle:</p> <ul> <li>A component <em>mounts</em> when it’s added to the screen.</li> <li>A component <em>updates</em> when it receives new props or state, usually in response to an interaction.</li> <li>A component <em>unmounts</em> when it’s removed from the screen.</li> </ul> <p><strong>It’s a good way to think about components, but <em>not</em> about Effects.</strong> Instead, try to think about each Effect independently from your component’s lifecycle. An Effect describes how to <a href="synchronizing-with-effects.html">synchronize an external system</a> to the current props and state. As your code changes, synchronization will need to happen more or less often.</p> <p>To illustrate this point, consider this Effect connecting your component to a chat server:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>const</span> <span>serverUrl</span> = <span>'https://localhost:1234'</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>roomId</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>Your Effect’s body specifies how to <strong>start synchronizing:</strong></p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code>    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>connection</span> = <span>createConnection</span><span>(</span><span>serverUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>roomId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ...</span></code></pre> <p>The cleanup function returned by your Effect specifies how to <strong>stop synchronizing:</strong></p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code>    <span>// ...</span>

    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ...</span></code></pre> <p>Intuitively, you might think that React would <strong>start synchronizing</strong> when your component mounts and <strong>stop synchronizing</strong> when your component unmounts. However, this is not the end of the story! Sometimes, it may also be necessary to <strong>start and stop synchronizing multiple times</strong> while the component remains mounted.</p> <p>Let’s look at <em>why</em> this is necessary, <em>when</em> it happens, and <em>how</em> you can control this behavior.</p> <div class="note note-green">
<h4>Note</h4>
<div><p>Some Effects don’t return a cleanup function at all. <a href="synchronizing-with-effects.html#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development">More often than not,</a> you’ll want to return one—but if you don’t, React will behave as if you returned an empty cleanup function.</p></div>

</h3> <p>Imagine this <code dir="ltr">ChatRoom</code> component receives a <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> prop that the user picks in a dropdown. Let’s say that initially the user picks the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> room as the <code dir="ltr">roomId</code>. Your app displays the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> chat room:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>const</span> <span>serverUrl</span> = <span>'https://localhost:1234'</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>/* "general" */</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>After the UI is displayed, React will run your Effect to <strong>start synchronizing.</strong> It connects to the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> room:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>/* "general" */</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>roomId</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// ...</span></code></pre> <p>So far, so good.</p> <p>Later, the user picks a different room in the dropdown (for example, <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code>). First, React will update the UI:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>/* "travel" */</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>Think about what should happen next. The user sees that <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code> is the selected chat room in the UI. However, the Effect that ran the last time is still connected to the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> room. <strong>The <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> prop has changed, so what your Effect did back then (connecting to the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> room) no longer matches the UI.</strong></p> <p>At this point, you want React to do two things:</p> <ol> <li>Stop synchronizing with the old <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> (disconnect from the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> room)</li> <li>Start synchronizing with the new <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> (connect to the <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code> room)</li> </ol> <p><strong>Luckily, you’ve already taught React how to do both of these things!</strong> Your Effect’s body specifies how to start synchronizing, and your cleanup function specifies how to stop synchronizing. All that React needs to do now is to call them in the correct order and with the correct props and state. Let’s see how exactly that happens.</p> <h3 id="how-react-re-synchronizes-your-effect">How React re-synchronizes your Effect 
</h3> <p>Recall that your <code dir="ltr">ChatRoom</code> component has received a new value for its <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> prop. It used to be <code dir="ltr">"general"</code>, and now it is <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code>. React needs to re-synchronize your Effect to re-connect you to a different room.</p> <p>To <strong>stop synchronizing,</strong> React will call the cleanup function that your Effect returned after connecting to the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> room. Since <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> was <code dir="ltr">"general"</code>, the cleanup function disconnects from the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> room:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>/* "general" */</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>connection</span> = <span>createConnection</span><span>(</span><span>serverUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>roomId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Connects to the "general" room</span>
    <span>connection</span>.<span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>connection</span>.<span>disconnect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Disconnects from the "general" room</span>
    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ...</span></code></pre> <p>Then React will run the Effect that you’ve provided during this render. This time, <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> is <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code> so it will <strong>start synchronizing</strong> to the <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code> chat room (until its cleanup function is eventually called too):</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>/* "travel" */</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>connection</span> = <span>createConnection</span><span>(</span><span>serverUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>roomId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Connects to the "travel" room</span>
    <span>connection</span>.<span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ...</span></code></pre> <p>Thanks to this, you’re now connected to the same room that the user chose in the UI. Disaster averted!</p> <p>Every time after your component re-renders with a different <code dir="ltr">roomId</code>, your Effect will re-synchronize. For example, let’s say the user changes <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> from <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code> to <code dir="ltr">"music"</code>. React will again <strong>stop synchronizing</strong> your Effect by calling its cleanup function (disconnecting you from the <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code> room). Then it will <strong>start synchronizing</strong> again by running its body with the new <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> prop (connecting you to the <code dir="ltr">"music"</code> room).</p> <p>Finally, when the user goes to a different screen, <code dir="ltr">ChatRoom</code> unmounts. Now there is no need to stay connected at all. React will <strong>stop synchronizing</strong> your Effect one last time and disconnect you from the <code dir="ltr">"music"</code> chat room.</p> <h3 id="thinking-from-the-effects-perspective">Thinking from the Effect’s perspective 
</h3> <p>Let’s recap everything that’s happened from the <code dir="ltr">ChatRoom</code> component’s perspective:</p> <ol> <li>
<code dir="ltr">ChatRoom</code> mounted with <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> set to <code dir="ltr">"general"</code>
</li> <li>
<code dir="ltr">ChatRoom</code> updated with <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> set to <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code>
</li> <li>
<code dir="ltr">ChatRoom</code> updated with <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> set to <code dir="ltr">"music"</code>
</li> <li>
<code dir="ltr">ChatRoom</code> unmounted</li> </ol> <p>During each of these points in the component’s lifecycle, your Effect did different things:</p> <ol> <li>Your Effect connected to the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> room</li> <li>Your Effect disconnected from the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> room and connected to the <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code> room</li> <li>Your Effect disconnected from the <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code> room and connected to the <code dir="ltr">"music"</code> room</li> <li>Your Effect disconnected from the <code dir="ltr">"music"</code> room</li> </ol> <p>Now let’s think about what happened from the perspective of the Effect itself:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code>  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>roomId</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre> <p>This code’s structure might inspire you to see what happened as a sequence of non-overlapping time periods:</p> <ol> <li>Your Effect connected to the <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> room (until it disconnected)</li> <li>Your Effect connected to the <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code> room (until it disconnected)</li> <li>Your Effect connected to the <code dir="ltr">"music"</code> room (until it disconnected)</li> </ol> <p>Previously, you were thinking from the component’s perspective. When you looked from the component’s perspective, it was tempting to think of Effects as “callbacks” or “lifecycle events” that fire at a specific time like “after a render” or “before unmount”. This way of thinking gets complicated very fast, so it’s best to avoid.</p> <p><strong>Instead, always focus on a single start/stop cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether a component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. All you need to do is to describe how to start synchronization and how to stop it. If you do it well, your Effect will be resilient to being started and stopped as many times as it’s needed.</strong></p> <p>This might remind you how you don’t think whether a component is mounting or updating when you write the rendering logic that creates JSX. You describe what should be on the screen, and React <a href="reacting-to-input-with-state.html">figures out the rest.</a></p> <h3 id="how-react-verifies-that-your-effect-can-re-synchronize">How React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize

</pre> <p>Notice that when the component mounts for the first time, you see three logs:</p> <ol> <li>
<code dir="ltr">✅ Connecting to "general" room at https://localhost:1234...</code> <em>(development-only)</em>
</li> <li>
<code dir="ltr">❌ Disconnected from "general" room at https://localhost:1234.</code> <em>(development-only)</em>
</li> <li><code dir="ltr">✅ Connecting to "general" room at https://localhost:1234...</code></li> </ol> <p>The first two logs are development-only. In development, React always remounts each component once.</p> <p><strong>React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize by forcing it to do that immediately in development.</strong> This might remind you of opening a door and closing it an extra time to check if the door lock works. React starts and stops your Effect one extra time in development to check <a href="synchronizing-with-effects.html#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development">you’ve implemented its cleanup well.</a></p> <p>The main reason your Effect will re-synchronize in practice is if some data it uses has changed. In the sandbox above, change the selected chat room. Notice how, when the <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> changes, your Effect re-synchronizes.</p> <p>However, there are also more unusual cases in which re-synchronization is necessary. For example, try editing the <code dir="ltr">serverUrl</code> in the sandbox above while the chat is open. Notice how the Effect re-synchronizes in response to your edits to the code. In the future, React may add more features that rely on re-synchronization.</p> <h3 id="how-react-knows-that-it-needs-to-re-synchronize-the-effect">How React knows that it needs to re-synchronize the Effect 
</h3> <p>You might be wondering how React knew that your Effect needed to re-synchronize after <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> changes. It’s because <em>you told React</em> that its code depends on <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> by including it in the <a href="synchronizing-with-effects.html#step-2-specify-the-effect-dependencies">list of dependencies:</a></p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// The roomId prop may change over time</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>roomId</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// So you tell React that this Effect "depends on" roomId</span>
  <span>// ...</span></code></pre> <p>Here’s how this works:</p> <ol> <li>You knew <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> is a prop, which means it can change over time.</li> <li>You knew that your Effect reads <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> (so its logic depends on a value that may change later).</li> <li>This is why you specified it as your Effect’s dependency (so that it re-synchronizes when <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> changes).</li> </ol> <p>Every time after your component re-renders, React will look at the array of dependencies that you have passed. If any of the values in the array is different from the value at the same spot that you passed during the previous render, React will re-synchronize your Effect.</p> <p>For example, if you passed <code dir="ltr">["general"]</code> during the initial render, and later you passed <code dir="ltr">["travel"]</code> during the next render, React will compare <code dir="ltr">"general"</code> and <code dir="ltr">"travel"</code>. These are different values (compared with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code dir="ltr">Object.is</code></a>), so React will re-synchronize your Effect. On the other hand, if your component re-renders but <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> has not changed, your Effect will remain connected to the same room.</p> <h3 id="each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process">Each Effect represents a separate synchronization process 
</h3> <p>Resist adding unrelated logic to your Effect only because this logic needs to run at the same time as an Effect you already wrote. For example, let’s say you want to send an analytics event when the user visits the room. You already have an Effect that depends on <code dir="ltr">roomId</code>, so you might feel tempted to add the analytics call there:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>logVisit</span><span>(</span><span>roomId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>connection</span> = <span>createConnection</span><span>(</span><span>serverUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>roomId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>connection</span>.<span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>connection</span>.<span>disconnect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>roomId</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</pre> <p>However, if you <a href="#thinking-from-the-effects-perspective">think from the Effect’s perspective,</a> you don’t need to think about mounting and unmounting at all. What’s important is you’ve specified what your Effect does to start and stop synchronizing. Today, it has no reactive dependencies. But if you ever want the user to change <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> or <code dir="ltr">serverUrl</code> over time (and they would become reactive), your Effect’s code won’t change. You will only need to add them to the dependencies.</p> <h3 id="all-variables-declared-in-the-component-body-are-reactive">All variables declared in the component body are reactive 
</h3> <p>Props and state aren’t the only reactive values. Values that you calculate from them are also reactive. If the props or state change, your component will re-render, and the values calculated from them will also change. This is why all variables from the component body used by the Effect should be in the Effect dependency list.</p> <p>Let’s say that the user can pick a chat server in the dropdown, but they can also configure a default server in settings. Suppose you’ve already put the settings state in a <a href="scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context.html">context</a> so you read the <code dir="ltr">settings</code> from that context. Now you calculate the <code dir="ltr">serverUrl</code> based on the selected server from props and the default server:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span><span>,</span> <span>selectedServerUrl</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// roomId is reactive</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>In this example, <code dir="ltr">serverUrl</code> is not a prop or a state variable. It’s a regular variable that you calculate during rendering. But it’s calculated during rendering, so it can change due to a re-render. This is why it’s reactive.</p> <p><strong>All values inside the component (including props, state, and variables in your component’s body) are reactive. Any reactive value can change on a re-render, so you need to include reactive values as Effect’s dependencies.</strong></p> <p>In other words, Effects “react” to all values from the component body.</p> <details class="note note-blue"><summary tabindex="-1"><h5>
Deep Dive</h5>
<h4 id="can-global-or-mutable-values-be-dependencies">Can global or mutable values be dependencies? 
</h4></summary><div>
<p>Mutable values (including global variables) aren’t reactive.</p>
<p><strong>A mutable value like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/pathname" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code dir="ltr">location.pathname</code></a> can’t be a dependency.</strong> It’s mutable, so it can change at any time completely outside of the React rendering data flow. Changing it wouldn’t trigger a re-render of your component. Therefore, even if you specified it in the dependencies, React <em>wouldn’t know</em> to re-synchronize the Effect when it changes. This also breaks the rules of React because reading mutable data during rendering (which is when you calculate the dependencies) breaks <a href="keeping-components-pure.html">purity of rendering.</a> Instead, you should read and subscribe to an external mutable value with <a href="you-might-not-need-an-effect.html#subscribing-to-an-external-store"><code dir="ltr">useSyncExternalStore</code>.</a></p>
<p><strong>A mutable value like <a href="../reference/react/useref.html#reference"><code dir="ltr">ref.current</code></a> or things you read from it also can’t be a dependency.</strong> The ref object returned by <code dir="ltr">useRef</code> itself can be a dependency, but its <code dir="ltr">current</code> property is intentionally mutable. It lets you <a href="referencing-values-with-refs.html">keep track of something without triggering a re-render.</a> But since changing it doesn’t trigger a re-render, it’s not a reactive value, and React won’t know to re-run your Effect when it changes.</p>
<p>As you’ll learn below on this page, a linter will check for these issues automatically.</p>

Both <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> and <code dir="ltr">serverUrl</code> may change over time, but you’re forgetting to re-synchronize your Effect when they change. You will remain connected to the initial <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> and <code dir="ltr">serverUrl</code> even after the user picks different values in the UI.</p> <p>To fix the bug, follow the linter’s suggestion to specify <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> and <code dir="ltr">serverUrl</code> as dependencies of your Effect:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>roomId</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// roomId is reactive</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>serverUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>setServerUrl</span><span>]</span> = <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>'https://localhost:1234'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// serverUrl is reactive</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>connection</span> = <span>createConnection</span><span>(</span><span>serverUrl</span><span>,</span> <span>roomId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<h4>Note</h4>
<div><p>In some cases, React <em>knows</em> that a value never changes even though it’s declared inside the component. For example, the <a href="../reference/react/usestate.html#setstate"><code dir="ltr">set</code> function</a> returned from <code dir="ltr">useState</code> and the ref object returned by <a href="../reference/react/useref.html"><code dir="ltr">useRef</code></a> are <em>stable</em>—they are guaranteed to not change on a re-render. Stable values aren’t reactive, so you may omit them from the list. Including them is allowed: they won’t change, so it doesn’t matter.</p></div>
</div> <h3 id="what-to-do-when-you-dont-want-to-re-synchronize">What to do when you don’t want to re-synchronize 
</h3> <p>In the previous example, you’ve fixed the lint error by listing <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> and <code dir="ltr">serverUrl</code> as dependencies.</p> <p><strong>However, you could instead “prove” to the linter that these values aren’t reactive values,</strong> i.e. that they <em>can’t</em> change as a result of a re-render. For example, if <code dir="ltr">serverUrl</code> and <code dir="ltr">roomId</code> don’t depend on rendering and always have the same values, you can move them outside the component. Now they don’t need to be dependencies:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>const</span> <span>serverUrl</span> = <span>'https://localhost:1234'</span><span>;</span> <span>// serverUrl is not reactive</span>
<span>const</span> <span>roomId</span> = <span>'general'</span><span>;</span> <span>// roomId is not reactive</span>

  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>You can also move them <em>inside the Effect.</em> They aren’t calculated during rendering, so they’re not reactive:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatRoom</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p><strong>Effects are reactive blocks of code.</strong> They re-synchronize when the values you read inside of them change. Unlike event handlers, which only run once per interaction, Effects run whenever synchronization is necessary.</p> <p><strong>You can’t “choose” your dependencies.</strong> Your dependencies must include every <a href="#all-variables-declared-in-the-component-body-are-reactive">reactive value</a> you read in the Effect. The linter enforces this. Sometimes this may lead to problems like infinite loops and to your Effect re-synchronizing too often. Don’t fix these problems by suppressing the linter! Here’s what to try instead:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Check that your Effect represents an independent synchronization process.</strong> If your Effect doesn’t synchronize anything, <a href="you-might-not-need-an-effect.html">it might be unnecessary.</a> If it synchronizes several independent things, <a href="#each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process">split it up.</a></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>If you want to read the latest value of props or state without “reacting” to it and re-synchronizing the Effect,</strong> you can split your Effect into a reactive part (which you’ll keep in the Effect) and a non-reactive part (which you’ll extract into something called an <em>Effect Event</em>). <a href="separating-events-from-effects.html">Read about separating Events from Effects.</a></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Avoid relying on objects and functions as dependencies.</strong> If you create objects and functions during rendering and then read them from an Effect, they will be different on every render. This will cause your Effect to re-synchronize every time. <a href="removing-effect-dependencies.html">Read more about removing unnecessary dependencies from Effects.</a></p> </li> </ul> <div class="note note-orange">
<h4>Pitfall</h4>
<div>
<p>The linter is your friend, but its powers are limited. The linter only knows when the dependencies are <em>wrong</em>. It doesn’t know <em>the best</em> way to solve each case. If the linter suggests a dependency, but adding it causes a loop, it doesn’t mean the linter should be ignored. You need to change the code inside (or outside) the Effect so that that value isn’t reactive and doesn’t <em>need</em> to be a dependency.</p>
<p>If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>// 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:</span>

</h4>
<p>In this example, the <code dir="ltr">ChatRoom</code> component connects to the chat room when the component mounts, disconnects when it unmounts, and reconnects when you select a different chat room. This behavior is correct, so you need to keep it working.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem. Whenever you type into the message box input at the bottom, <code dir="ltr">ChatRoom</code> <em>also</em> reconnects to the chat. (You can notice this by clearing the console and typing into the input.) Fix the issue so that this doesn’t happen.</p>
