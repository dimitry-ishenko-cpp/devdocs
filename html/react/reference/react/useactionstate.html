</h3>  <p>Call <code dir="ltr">useActionState</code> at the top level of your component to create component state that is updated <a href="../react-dom/components/form.html">when a form action is invoked</a>. You pass <code dir="ltr">useActionState</code> an existing form action function as well as an initial state, and it returns a new action that you use in your form, along with the latest form state and whether the Action is still pending. The latest form state is also passed to the function that you provided.</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>useActionState</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>The form state is the value returned by the action when the form was last submitted. If the form has not yet been submitted, it is the initial state that you pass.</p> <p>If used with a Server Function, <code dir="ltr">useActionState</code> allows the server’s response from submitting the form to be shown even before hydration has completed.</p> <p><a href="#usage">See more examples below.</a></p> <h4 id="parameters">Parameters 
</h4> <ul> <li>
<code dir="ltr">fn</code>: The function to be called when the form is submitted or button pressed. When the function is called, it will receive the previous state of the form (initially the <code dir="ltr">initialState</code> that you pass, subsequently its previous return value) as its initial argument, followed by the arguments that a form action normally receives.</li> <li>
<code dir="ltr">initialState</code>: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be any serializable value. This argument is ignored after the action is first invoked.</li> <li>
<strong>optional</strong> <code dir="ltr">permalink</code>: A string containing the unique page URL that this form modifies. For use on pages with dynamic content (eg: feeds) in conjunction with progressive enhancement: if <code dir="ltr">fn</code> is a <a href="../rsc/server-functions.html">server function</a> and the form is submitted before the JavaScript bundle loads, the browser will navigate to the specified permalink URL, rather than the current page’s URL. Ensure that the same form component is rendered on the destination page (including the same action <code dir="ltr">fn</code> and <code dir="ltr">permalink</code>) so that React knows how to pass the state through. Once the form has been hydrated, this parameter has no effect.</li> </ul>  <h4 id="returns">Returns 
</h4> <p><code dir="ltr">useActionState</code> returns an array with the following values:</p> <ol> <li>The current state. During the first render, it will match the <code dir="ltr">initialState</code> you have passed. After the action is invoked, it will match the value returned by the action.</li> <li>A new action that you can pass as the <code dir="ltr">action</code> prop to your <code dir="ltr">form</code> component or <code dir="ltr">formAction</code> prop to any <code dir="ltr">button</code> component within the form.</li> <li>The <code dir="ltr">isPending</code> flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.</li> </ol> <h4 id="caveats">Caveats 
</h4> <ul> <li>When used with a framework that supports React Server Components, <code dir="ltr">useActionState</code> lets you make forms interactive before JavaScript has executed on the client. When used without Server Components, it is equivalent to component local state.</li> <li>The function passed to <code dir="ltr">useActionState</code> receives an extra argument, the previous or initial state, as its first argument. This makes its signature different than if it were used directly as a form action without using <code dir="ltr">useActionState</code>.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="usage">Usage
