</h4> <ul> <li> <p><code dir="ltr">calculateValue</code>: The function calculating the value that you want to cache. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your function during the initial render. On next renders, React will return the same value again if the <code dir="ltr">dependencies</code> have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will call <code dir="ltr">calculateValue</code>, return its result, and store it so it can be reused later.</p> </li> <li> <p><code dir="ltr">dependencies</code>: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the <code dir="ltr">calculateValue</code> code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is <a href="../../learn/editor-setup.html#linting">configured for React</a>, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like <code dir="ltr">[dep1, dep2, dep3]</code>. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code dir="ltr">Object.is</code></a> comparison.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="returns">Returns 
</h4> <p>On the initial render, <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> returns the result of calling <code dir="ltr">calculateValue</code> with no arguments.</p> <p>During next renders, it will either return an already stored value from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or call <code dir="ltr">calculateValue</code> again, and return the result that <code dir="ltr">calculateValue</code> has returned.</p> <h4 id="caveats">Caveats 
</h4> <ul> <li>
<code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> is a Hook, so you can only call it <strong>at the top level of your component</strong> or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.</li> <li>In Strict Mode, React will <strong>call your calculation function twice</strong> in order to <a href="#my-calculation-runs-twice-on-every-re-render">help you find accidental impurities.</a> This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your calculation function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.</li> <li>React <strong>will not throw away the cached value unless there is a specific reason to do that.</strong> For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should be fine if you rely on <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> solely as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a <a href="usestate.html#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state">state variable</a> or a <a href="useref.html#avoiding-recreating-the-ref-contents">ref</a> may be more appropriate.</li> </ul> <div class="note note-green">

<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>Usually, this isn’t a problem because most calculations are very fast. However, if you’re filtering or transforming a large array, or doing some expensive computation, you might want to skip doing it again if data hasn’t changed. If both <code dir="ltr">todos</code> and <code dir="ltr">tab</code> are the same as they were during the last render, wrapping the calculation in <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> like earlier lets you reuse <code dir="ltr">visibleTodos</code> you’ve already calculated before.</p> <p>This type of caching is called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">memoization.</a></em></p> <div class="note note-green">

<h4 id="how-to-tell-if-a-calculation-is-expensive">How to tell if a calculation is expensive? 
</h4></summary><div>
<p>In general, unless you’re creating or looping over thousands of objects, it’s probably not expensive. If you want to get more confidence, you can add a console log to measure the time spent in a piece of code:</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>console</span>.<span>time</span><span>(</span><span>'filter array'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>visibleTodos</span> = <span>filterTodos</span><span>(</span><span>todos</span><span>,</span> <span>tab</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>console</span>.<span>timeEnd</span><span>(</span><span>'filter array'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Perform the interaction you’re measuring (for example, typing into the input). You will then see logs like <code dir="ltr">filter array: 0.15ms</code> in your console. If the overall logged time adds up to a significant amount (say, <code dir="ltr">1ms</code> or more), it might make sense to memoize that calculation. As an experiment, you can then wrap the calculation in <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> to verify whether the total logged time has decreased for that interaction or not:</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>console</span>.<span>time</span><span>(</span><span>'filter array'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>visibleTodos</span> = <span>useMemo</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>filterTodos</span><span>(</span><span>todos</span><span>,</span> <span>tab</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Skipped if todos and tab haven't changed</span>
<span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>todos</span><span>,</span> <span>tab</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>console</span>.<span>timeEnd</span><span>(</span><span>'filter array'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p><code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> won’t make the <em>first</em> render faster. It only helps you skip unnecessary work on updates.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users’ so it’s a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown. For example, Chrome offers a <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-61/#throttling" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CPU Throttling</a> option for this.</p>
<p>Also note that measuring performance in development will not give you the most accurate results. (For example, when <a href="strictmode.html">Strict Mode</a> is on, you will see each component render twice rather than once.) To get the most accurate timings, build your app for production and test it on a device like your users have.</p>

<h4 id="should-you-add-usememo-everywhere">Should you add useMemo everywhere? 
</h4></summary><div>
<p>If your app is like this site, and most interactions are coarse (like replacing a page or an entire section), memoization is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful.</p>
<p>Optimizing with <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> is only valuable in a few cases:</p>
<ul> <li>The calculation you’re putting in <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> is noticeably slow, and its dependencies rarely change.</li> <li>You pass it as a prop to a component wrapped in <a href="memo.html"><code dir="ltr">memo</code>.</a> You want to skip re-rendering if the value hasn’t changed. Memoization lets your component re-render only when dependencies aren’t the same.</li> <li>The value you’re passing is later used as a dependency of some Hook. For example, maybe another <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> calculation value depends on it. Or maybe you are depending on this value from <a href="useeffect.html"><code dir="ltr">useEffect.</code></a>
</li> </ul>
<p>There is no benefit to wrapping a calculation in <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside of this approach is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that’s “always new” is enough to break memoization for an entire component.</p>
<p><strong>In practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles:</strong></p>
<ol> <li>When a component visually wraps other components, let it <a href="../../learn/passing-props-to-a-component.html#passing-jsx-as-children">accept JSX as children.</a> This way, when the wrapper component updates its own state, React knows that its children don’t need to re-render.</li> <li>Prefer local state and don’t <a href="../../learn/sharing-state-between-components.html">lift state up</a> any further than necessary. For example, don’t keep transient state like forms and whether an item is hovered at the top of your tree or in a global state library.</li> <li>Keep your <a href="../../learn/keeping-components-pure.html">rendering logic pure.</a> If re-rendering a component causes a problem or produces some noticeable visual artifact, it’s a bug in your component! Fix the bug instead of adding memoization.</li> <li>Avoid <a href="../../learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect.html">unnecessary Effects that update state.</a> Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over.</li> <li>Try to <a href="../../learn/removing-effect-dependencies.html">remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.</a> For example, instead of memoization, it’s often simpler to move some object or a function inside an Effect or outside the component.</li> </ol>
<p>If a specific interaction still feels laggy, <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">use the React Developer Tools profiler</a> to see which components would benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it’s good to follow them in any case. In the long term, we’re researching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEMwh32soc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">doing granular memoization automatically</a> to solve this once and for all.</p>
</div></details>  <hr> <h3 id="skipping-re-rendering-of-components">Skipping re-rendering of components 
</h3> <p>In some cases, <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> can also help you optimize performance of re-rendering child components. To illustrate this, let’s say this <code dir="ltr">TodoList</code> component passes the <code dir="ltr">visibleTodos</code> as a prop to the child <code dir="ltr">List</code> component:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>TodoList</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>todos</span><span>,</span> <span>tab</span><span>,</span> <span>theme</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>{</span><span>theme</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>List</span> <span>items</span>=<span>{</span><span>visibleTodos</span><span>}</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>You’ve noticed that toggling the <code dir="ltr">theme</code> prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <code dir="ltr">&lt;List /&gt;</code> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the <code dir="ltr">List</code> component.</p> <p><strong>By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively.</strong> This is why, when <code dir="ltr">TodoList</code> re-renders with a different <code dir="ltr">theme</code>, the <code dir="ltr">List</code> component <em>also</em> re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you’ve verified that a re-render is slow, you can tell <code dir="ltr">List</code> to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in <a href="memo.html"><code dir="ltr">memo</code>:</a></p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>memo</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>List</span> = <span>memo</span><span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>List</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>items</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre> <p><strong>With this change, <code dir="ltr">List</code> will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the <em>same</em> as on the last render.</strong> This is where caching the calculation becomes important! Imagine that you calculated <code dir="ltr">visibleTodos</code> without <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code>:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>TodoList</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>todos</span><span>,</span> <span>tab</span><span>,</span> <span>theme</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p><strong>In the above example, the <code dir="ltr">filterTodos</code> function always creates a <em>different</em> array,</strong> similar to how the <code dir="ltr">{}</code> object literal always creates a new object.

In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in <a href="memo.html"><code dir="ltr">memo</code>,</a> and this lets it skip re-rendering.

<p>Instead of wrapping <code dir="ltr">List</code> in <a href="memo.html"><code dir="ltr">memo</code></a>, you could wrap the <code dir="ltr">&lt;List /&gt;</code> JSX node itself in <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code>:</p>

    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The behavior would be the same. If the <code dir="ltr">visibleTodos</code> haven’t changed, <code dir="ltr">List</code> won’t be re-rendered.</p>
<p>A JSX node like <code dir="ltr">&lt;List items={visibleTodos} /&gt;</code> is an object like <code dir="ltr">{ type: List, props: { items: visibleTodos } }</code>. Creating this object is very cheap, but React doesn’t know whether its contents is the same as last time or not. This is why by default, React will re-render the <code dir="ltr">List</code> component.</p>
<p>However, if React sees the same exact JSX as during the previous render, it won’t try to re-render your component. This is because JSX nodes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">immutable.</a> A JSX node object could not have changed over time, so React knows it’s safe to skip a re-render. However, for this to work, the node has to <em>actually be the same object</em>, not merely look the same in code. This is what <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> does in this example.</p>
<p>Manually wrapping JSX nodes into <code dir="ltr">useMemo</code> is not convenient. For example, you can’t do this conditionally. This is usually why you would wrap components with <a href="memo.html"><code dir="ltr">memo</code></a> instead of wrapping JSX nodes.</p>
