<h1>React calls Components and Hooks
</h1>
<div><p>React is responsible for rendering components and Hooks when necessary to optimize the user experience. It is declarative: you tell React what to render in your component‚Äôs logic, and React will figure out how best to display it to your user.</p></div> <ul>

</h2> <p>Components should only be used in JSX. Don‚Äôt call them as regular functions. React should call it.</p> <p>React must decide when your component function is called <a href="components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.html#how-does-react-run-your-code">during rendering</a>. In React, you do this using JSX.</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>BlogPost</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>Layout</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Article</span> <span>/&gt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Layout</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span> <span>// ‚úÖ Good: Only use components in JSX</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>BlogPost</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>Layout</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>Article</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Layout</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span> <span>// üî¥ Bad: Never call them directly</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>If a component contains Hooks, it‚Äôs easy to violate the <a href="rules-of-hooks.html">Rules of Hooks</a> when components are called directly in a loop or conditionally.</p> <p>Letting React orchestrate rendering also allows a number of benefits:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Components become more than functions.</strong> React can augment them with features like <em>local state</em> through Hooks that are tied to the component‚Äôs identity in the tree.</li> <li>
<strong>Component types participate in reconciliation.</strong> By letting React call your components, you also tell it more about the conceptual structure of your tree. For example, when you move from rendering <code dir="ltr">&lt;Feed&gt;</code> to the <code dir="ltr">&lt;Profile&gt;</code> page, React won‚Äôt attempt to re-use them.</li> <li>
<strong>React can enhance your user experience.</strong> For example, it can let the browser do some work between component calls so that re-rendering a large component tree doesn‚Äôt block the main thread.</li> <li>
<strong>A better debugging story.</strong> If components are first-class citizens that the library is aware of, we can build rich developer tools for introspection in development.</li> <li>
<strong>More efficient reconciliation.</strong> React can decide exactly which components in the tree need re-rendering and skip over the ones that don‚Äôt. That makes your app faster and more snappy.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="never-pass-around-hooks-as-regular-values">Never pass around Hooks as regular values 
</h2> <p>Hooks should only be called inside of components or Hooks. Never pass it around as a regular value.</p> <p>Hooks allow you to augment a component with React features. They should always be called as a function, and never passed around as a regular value. This enables <em>local reasoning</em>, or the ability for developers to understand everything a component can do by looking at that component in isolation.</p> <p>Breaking this rule will cause React to not automatically optimize your component.</p> <h3 id="dont-dynamically-mutate-a-hook">Don‚Äôt dynamically mutate a Hook 
</h3> <p>Hooks should be as ‚Äústatic‚Äù as possible. This means you shouldn‚Äôt dynamically mutate them. For example, this means you shouldn‚Äôt write higher order Hooks:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatInput</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>useDataWithLogging</span> = <span>withLogging</span><span>(</span><span>useData</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// üî¥ Bad: don't write higher order Hooks</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>data</span> = <span>useDataWithLogging</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>Hooks should be immutable and not be mutated. Instead of mutating a Hook dynamically, create a static version of the Hook with the desired functionality.</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatInput</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>data</span> = <span>useDataWithLogging</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// ‚úÖ Good: Create a new version of the Hook</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>useDataWithLogging</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ... Create a new version of the Hook and inline the logic here</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <h3 id="dont-dynamically-use-hooks">Don‚Äôt dynamically use Hooks 
</h3> <p>Hooks should also not be dynamically used: for example, instead of doing dependency injection in a component by passing a Hook as a value:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatInput</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>Button</span> <span>useData</span>=<span>{</span><span>useDataWithLogging</span><span>}</span> <span>/&gt;</span> <span>// üî¥ Bad: don't pass Hooks as props</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>You should always inline the call of the Hook into that component and handle any logic in there.</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>ChatInput</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>Button</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>Button</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>data</span> = <span>useDataWithLogging</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// ‚úÖ Good: Use the Hook directly</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>useDataWithLogging</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// If there's any conditional logic to change the Hook's behavior, it should be inlined into</span>
  <span>// the Hook</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>This way, <code dir="ltr">&lt;Button /&gt;</code> is much easier to understand and debug. When Hooks are used in dynamic ways, it increases the complexity of your app greatly and inhibits local reasoning, making your team less productive in the long term. It also makes it easier to accidentally break the <a href="rules-of-hooks.html">Rules of Hooks</a> that Hooks should not be called conditionally. If you find yourself needing to mock components for tests, it‚Äôs better to mock the server instead to respond with canned data. If possible, it‚Äôs also usually more effective to test your app with end-to-end tests.</p><div class="_attribution">
