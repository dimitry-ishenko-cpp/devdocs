</ul> <h3 id="why-does-purity-matter">Why does purity matter? 
</h3> <p>One of the key concepts that makes React, <em>React</em> is <em>purity</em>. A pure component or hook is one that is:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Idempotent</strong> – You <a href="../../learn/keeping-components-pure.html#purity-components-as-formulas">always get the same result every time</a> you run it with the same inputs – props, state, context for component inputs; and arguments for hook inputs.</li> <li>
<strong>Has no side effects in render</strong> – Code with side effects should run <a href="#how-does-react-run-your-code"><strong>separately from rendering</strong></a>. For example as an <a href="../../learn/responding-to-events.html">event handler</a> – where the user interacts with the UI and causes it to update; or as an <a href="../react/useeffect.html">Effect</a> – which runs after render.</li> <li>
<strong>Does not mutate non-local values</strong>: Components and Hooks should <a href="#mutation">never modify values that aren’t created locally</a> in render.</li> </ul> <p>When render is kept pure, React can understand how to prioritize which updates are most important for the user to see first. This is made possible because of render purity: since components don’t have side effects <a href="#how-does-react-run-your-code">in render</a>, React can pause rendering components that aren’t as important to update, and only come back to them later when it’s needed.</p> <p>Concretely, this means that rendering logic can be run multiple times in a way that allows React to give your user a pleasant user experience. However, if your component has an untracked side effect – like modifying the value of a global variable <a href="#how-does-react-run-your-code">during render</a> – when React runs your rendering code again, your side effects will be triggered in a way that won’t match what you want. This often leads to unexpected bugs that can degrade how your users experience your app. You can see an <a href="../../learn/keeping-components-pure.html#side-effects-unintended-consequences">example of this in the Keeping Components Pure page</a>.</p> <h4 id="how-does-react-run-your-code">How does React run your code? 
</h4> <p>React is declarative: you tell React <em>what</em> to render, and React will figure out <em>how</em> best to display it to your user. To do this, React has a few phases where it runs your code. You don’t need to know about all of these phases to use React well. But at a high level, you should know about what code runs in <em>render</em>, and what runs outside of it.</p> <p><em>Rendering</em> refers to calculating what the next version of your UI should look like. After rendering, <a href="../react/useeffect.html">Effects</a> are <em>flushed</em> (meaning they are run until there are no more left) and may update the calculation if the Effects have impacts on layout. React takes this new calculation and compares it to the calculation used to create the previous version of your UI, then <em>commits</em> just the minimum changes needed to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DOM</a> (what your user actually sees) to catch it up to the latest version.</p> <details class="note note-blue"><summary tabindex="-1"><h5>

</h4></summary><div>
<p>One quick heuristic to tell if code runs during render is to examine where it is: if it’s written at the top level like in the example below, there’s a good chance it runs during render.</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>Dropdown</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>selectedItems</span> = <span>new</span> <span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// created during render</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Event handlers and Effects don’t run in render:</p>
<pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>Dropdown</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>selectedItems</span> = <span>new</span> <span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>onSelect</span> = <span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// this code is in an event handler, so it's only run when the user triggers this</span>

</div></details> <hr> <h2 id="components-and-hooks-must-be-idempotent">Components and Hooks must be idempotent 
</h2> <p>Components must always return the same output with respect to their inputs – props, state, and context. This is known as <em>idempotency</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Idempotency</a> is a term popularized in functional programming. It refers to the idea that you <a href="../../learn/keeping-components-pure.html">always get the same result every time</a> you run that piece of code with the same inputs.</p> <p>This means that <em>all</em> code that runs <a href="#how-does-react-run-your-code">during render</a> must also be idempotent in order for this rule to hold. For example, this line of code is not idempotent (and therefore, neither is the component):</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>Clock</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>time</span> = <span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 🔴 Bad: always returns a different result!</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre> <p><code dir="ltr">new Date()</code> is not idempotent as it always returns the current date and changes its result every time it’s called. When you render the above component, the time displayed on the screen will stay stuck on the time that the component was rendered. Similarly, functions like <code dir="ltr">Math.random()</code> also aren’t idempotent, because they return different results every time they’re called, even when the inputs are the same.</p> <p>This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use non-idempotent functions like <code dir="ltr">new Date()</code> <em>at all</em> – you should just avoid using them <a href="#how-does-react-run-your-code">during render</a>. In this case, we can <em>synchronize</em> the latest date to this component using an <a href="../react/useeffect.html">Effect</a>:</p> 
<pre data-language="jsx"><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>useState</span><span>,</span> <span>useEffect</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>

</pre> <p>By wrapping the non-idempotent <code dir="ltr">new Date()</code> call in an Effect, it moves that calculation <a href="#how-does-react-run-your-code">outside of rendering</a>.</p> <p>If you don’t need to synchronize some external state with React, you can also consider using an <a href="../../learn/responding-to-events.html">event handler</a> if it only needs to be updated in response to a user interaction.</p> <hr> <h2 id="side-effects-must-run-outside-of-render">Side effects must run outside of render

<h4>Note</h4>
<div>
<p>Side effects are a broader term than Effects. Effects specifically refer to code that’s wrapped in <code dir="ltr">useEffect</code>, while a side effect is a general term for code that has any observable effect other than its primary result of returning a value to the caller.</p>
<p>Side effects are typically written inside of <a href="../../learn/responding-to-events.html">event handlers</a> or Effects. But never during render.</p>
</div>
</div> <p>While render must be kept pure, side effects are necessary at some point in order for your app to do anything interesting, like showing something on the screen! The key point of this rule is that side effects should not run <a href="#how-does-react-run-your-code">in render</a>, as React can render components multiple times. In most cases, you’ll use <a href="../../learn/responding-to-events.html">event handlers</a> to handle side effects. Using an event handler explicitly tells React that this code doesn’t need to run during render, keeping render pure. If you’ve exhausted all options – and only as a last resort – you can also handle side effects using <code dir="ltr">useEffect</code>.</p> <h3 id="mutation">When is it okay to have mutation? 
</h3> <h4 id="local-mutation">Local mutation 
</h4> <p>One common example of a side effect is mutation, which in JavaScript refers to changing the value of a non-<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">primitive</a> value. In general, while mutation is not idiomatic in React, <em>local</em> mutation is absolutely fine:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>FriendList</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>friends</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

In other words, <code dir="ltr">items</code> only stays around as long as the component does. Because <code dir="ltr">items</code> is always <em>recreated</em> every time <code dir="ltr">&lt;FriendList /&gt;</code> is rendered, the component will always return the same result.</p> <p>On the other hand, if <code dir="ltr">items</code> was created outside of the component, it holds on to its previous values and remembers changes:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>const</span> <span>items</span> = <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>// 🔴 Bad: created outside of the component</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>theme</span> = <span>useContext</span><span>(</span><span>ThemeContext</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>useMemo</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>newIcon</span> = <span>{</span> <span>...</span><span>icon</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>icon</span>.<span>enabled</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>newIcon</span>.<span>className</span> = <span>computeStyle</span><span>(</span><span>icon</span><span>,</span> <span>theme</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>newIcon</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>icon</span><span>,</span> <span>theme</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>If you were to mutate the Hooks arguments, the custom hook’s memoization will become incorrect, so it’s important to avoid doing that.</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>style</span> = <span>useIconStyle</span><span>(</span><span>icon</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>         <span>// `style` is memoized based on `icon`</span>
<span>icon</span>.<span>enabled</span> = <span>false</span><span>;</span>               <span>// Bad: 🔴 never mutate hook arguments directly</span>
<span>style</span> = <span>useIconStyle</span><span>(</span><span>icon</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>         <span>// previously memoized result is returned</span></code></pre> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>style</span> = <span>useIconStyle</span><span>(</span><span>icon</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>         <span>// `style` is memoized based on `icon`</span>
<span>icon</span> = <span>{</span> <span>...</span><span>icon</span><span>,</span> <span>enabled</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>// Good: ✅ make a copy instead</span>
<span>style</span> = <span>useIconStyle</span><span>(</span><span>icon</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>         <span>// new value of `style` is calculated</span></code></pre> <p>Similarly, it’s important to not modify the return values of Hooks, as they may have been memoized.</p> <hr> <h2 id="values-are-immutable-after-being-passed-to-jsx">Values are immutable after being passed to JSX 
</h2> <p>Don’t mutate values after they’ve been used in JSX. Move the mutation before the JSX is created.</p> <p>When you use JSX in an expression, React may eagerly evaluate the JSX before the component finishes rendering. This means that mutating values after they’ve been passed to JSX can lead to outdated UIs, as React won’t know to update the component’s output.</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><code><span>function</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>colour</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
