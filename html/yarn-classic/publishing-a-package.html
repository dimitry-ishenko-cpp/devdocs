<h1>2. Publishing a Package</h1>  <p>In order to share your package with other developers around the world through Yarn, you’ll first need to publish it.</p> <p>When you publish a package with Yarn it goes onto the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm registry</a> which is used to distribute packages globally.</p> <h2 id="logging-into-npm-">Logging into npm </h2> <p>If you haven’t already, you’ll first need to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/signup">create an npm account</a>. Once you’ve done that you can setup your username and email in Yarn.</p> <pre data-language="sh">yarn login</pre> <p>This will prompt you for your username and email. However, it will not ask you for your password. Yarn does not hold onto your password or any sessions. When you go to publish or modify something on npm, you will need to enter your password then.</p> <h2 id="publishing-your-package-">Publishing your package </h2> <p>Once you have written all the code in your package, tested it out and you are ready to publish you can kick things off:</p> <pre data-language="sh">yarn publish</pre> <p>First you will be asked to enter a new version to publish:</p> <pre data-language="">[1/4] Bumping version...
