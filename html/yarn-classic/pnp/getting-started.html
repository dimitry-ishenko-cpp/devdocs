<h1>2. Getting Started</h1>  <p>Getting started with Plug’n’Play isn’t difficult - at its basis it just involves enabling one tiny settings in your <code>package.json</code> file: <code>installConfig.pnp</code>.</p> <pre data-language="json">{
  "installConfig": {
    "pnp": true
  }
}</pre> <p>From now on each time you’ll run <code>yarn install</code> Yarn will create a single file named <code>.pnp.js</code> instead of the <code>node_modules</code> megafolder. You can try it right now by running <code>yarn --pnp</code> in your project, which will enable the settings and run the install in the same pass!</p> <p><code>.pnp.*</code> should also be added to your <code>.gitignore</code>. (see <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/qa#which-files-should-be-gitignored">which files should get ignored</a>)</p> <p>So enabling PnP isn’t complicated at all - what might be an issue are third-party packages that reimplement the Node resolution themselves. Three major implementations exist, more might also hide from a project to another:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/resolve"><code>resolve</code></a> is the main one, and is supported out-of-the-box thanks to the help of <a href="https://github.com/ljharb">Jordan Harband</a>. Every package using <code>resolve</code> (and that includes things you might have heard of like Babel or Gulp) now works without further configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/enhanced-resolve"><code>enhanced-resolve</code></a> is the second biggest one. You probably use it but might never have heard about it: it’s the resolver used by Webpack. We do support this resolver through the <a href="https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin">pnp-webpack-plugin</a> addon.</p> </li> <li> <p>TypeScript uses its own resolver as well. In this case the situation is a bit more complex - the TS team has some concerns about <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/18896">allowing third-party hooks</a> inside the <code>tsc</code> compiler, meaning that we can’t work with it at the moment. That being said, TypeScript isn’t only <code>tsc</code> and as such we’ve been able to add PnP support to the popular <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/ts-loader"><code>ts-loader</code></a> - meaning that as long as you compile your TypeScript through Webpack, everything works well! Consult the dedicated <a href="https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration">section</a> about it for more information.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In case you find something not working, consult the Troubleshooting section for some tips, then open an issue if things still are problematic. We really want PnP to become the de-facto installation strategy for Javascript packages and finally put <code>node_modules</code> behind us once and for all.</p><div class="_attribution">
