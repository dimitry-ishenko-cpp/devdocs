<h1>14. yarn import</h1>  <p class="lead">Generates <code>yarn.lock</code> from an npm <code>package-lock.json</code> file in the same location or an existing npm-installed <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p> <h3 id="yarn-import-">
<code>yarn import</code> </h3> <p>This command assists the migration of projects currently relying on <code>package-lock.json</code>, minimizing the differences between the lockfile and the existing dependency tree as best as it can.</p> <h2 id="motivation-">Motivation </h2> <p>Many projects currently use <code>package-lock.json</code> or check their <code>node_modules</code> into source control because they have fragile dependency trees. These projects can’t easily migrate to Yarn, because <code>yarn install</code> could produce a wildly different logical dependency tree. Not all trees can be represented by Yarn’s <code>yarn.lock</code>, and some valid trees will be automatically deduped upon install. These nuances and others present a significant barrier to manual migration.</p> <p><code>yarn import</code> aims to alleviate this challenge by generating a <code>yarn.lock</code> file in one of two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Using the dependency tree in an existing <code>package-lock.json</code> file created by <code>npm install</code>
</li> <li>If no such file exists, using the versions found inside <code>node_modules</code> according to normal <code>require.resolve()</code> resolution rules.</li> </ol> <p>In cases where the Yarn resolution mechanism can’t satisfy the existing dependency tree identically, alerts will be made so that you may manually review the changes. The existing <code>node_modules</code> tree will be checked for validity beforehand (if not importing from <code>package-lock.json</code>), and the resultant lockfile should be <code>yarn install</code>able without any surprises (failed compatibility, unresolvable dependencies, auto-dedupes, etc.)</p> <pre data-language="sh">$ yarn import</pre> <pre data-language="">yarn import vx.x.x
