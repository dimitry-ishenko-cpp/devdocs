A single package can have as many owners as you want.</p> <p>Owners have permission to do the following tasks:</p> <ol> <li>Publish new versions of the package</li> <li>Add or remove other owners of the package</li> <li>Change metadata for a package</li> </ol> <h2 id="caveats-">Caveats </h2> <p>There aren’t any other levels of access at this time. All users can either modify a package or they cannot. In the future, there may be more types of roles, but not at this time.</p> <h2 id="commands-">Commands </h2> <h3 id="yarn-owner-list-package-">
