<h1>27. yarn policies</h1>  <p class="lead">Defines project-wide policies for your project.</p> <h2 id="enforcing-yarns-version-across-your-project-">Enforcing Yarn’s version across your project </h2> <p>When working inside a team, you usually end up in the situation where one of your colleagues uses a different version of Yarn than you. While usually inconsequential, it might sometimes cause subtle and hard to debug issues - for example your colleague might be on a version of Yarn that doesn’t support a feature you rely on, such as the workspaces.</p> <p>In order to alleviate this issue, you can specify the required Yarn version inside the <code>package.json</code> file, which will prompt your colleagues to use the same version as you. Unfortunately, while technically strong, this technique adds an unwanted burden on them - given that the Yarn binary is typically global, switching from a branch to another might be particularly annoying if they change the version.</p> <p>To fix that, <code>yarn policies set-version</code> offers a simple way to <strong>check in your Yarn release within your repository.</strong> Once you run it, your configuration will be updated in such a way that anyone running a Yarn command inside the project will always use the version you set - and this transparently.</p> <p>The command accepts various ways to set which version you want to use:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>yarn policies set-version</code> will download the latest stable release</li> <li>
<code>yarn policies set-version --rc</code> will download the latest rc release</li> <li>
<code>yarn policies set-version 1.13.0</code> will download a specific version</li> <li>
<code>yarn policies set-version '^1.12.0'</code> will download the latest minor</li> </ul> <p>Under the hood, the command will simply download the single-file release from the GitHub repository, store it inside your project (inside the <code>.yarn/releases</code> folder), then finally update your configuration to point to the new file (using <code>yarn-path</code>).</p> <p>Note that this command also is the preferred way to upgrade Yarn - it will work no matter how you originally installed it, which might sometimes prove difficult to figure out otherwise.</p><div class="_attribution">
