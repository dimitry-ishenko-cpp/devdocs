<h1 id="contrib">click-contrib</h1> <p>As the number of users of Click grows, more and more major feature requests are made. To users it may seem reasonable to include those features with Click; however, many of them are experimental or aren’t practical to support generically. Maintainers have to choose what is reasonable to maintain in Click core.</p> <p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/click-contrib/">click-contrib</a> GitHub organization exists as a place to collect third-party packages that extend Click’s features. It is also meant to ease the effort of searching for such extensions.</p> <p>Please note that the quality and stability of those packages may be different than Click itself. While published under a common organization, they are still separate from Click and the Pallets maintainers.</p><div class="_attribution">
