<h1 id="complex-guide">Complex Applications</h1> <p>Click is designed to assist with the creation of complex and simple CLI tools alike. However, the power of its design is the ability to arbitrarily nest systems together. For instance, if you have ever used Django, you will have realized that it provides a command line utility, but so does Celery. When using Celery with Django, there are two tools that need to interact with each other and be cross-configured.</p> <p>In a theoretical world of two separate Click command line utilities, they could solve this problem by nesting one inside the other. For instance, the web framework could also load the commands for the message queue framework.</p> <section id="basic-concepts"> <h2>Basic Concepts</h2> <p>To understand how this works, you need to understand two concepts: contexts and the calling convention.</p> <section id="contexts"> <h3>Contexts</h3> <p>Whenever a Click command is executed, a <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.Context" title="click.Context"><code>Context</code></a> object is created which holds state for this particular invocation. It remembers parsed parameters, what command created it, which resources need to be cleaned up at the end of the function, and so forth. It can also optionally hold an application-defined object.</p> <p>Context objects build a linked list until they hit the top one. Each context is linked to a parent context. This allows a command to work below another command and store its own information there without having to be afraid of altering up the state of the parent command.</p> <p>Because the parent data is available, however, it is possible to navigate to it if needed.</p> <p>Most of the time, you do not see the context object, but when writing more complex applications it comes in handy. This brings us to the next point.</p> </section> <section id="calling-convention"> <h3>Calling Convention</h3> <p>When a Click command callback is executed, it’s passed all the non-hidden parameters as keyword arguments. Notably absent is the context. However, a callback can opt into being passed to the context object by marking itself with <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.pass_context" title="click.pass_context"><code>pass_context()</code></a>.</p> <p>So how do you invoke a command callback if you don’t know if it should receive the context or not? The answer is that the context itself provides a helper function (<a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.Context.invoke" title="click.Context.invoke"><code>Context.invoke()</code></a>) which can do this for you. It accepts the callback as first argument and then invokes the function correctly.</p> </section> </section> <section id="building-a-git-clone"> <h2>Building a Git Clone</h2> <p>In this example, we want to build a command line tool that resembles a version control system. Systems like Git usually provide one over-arching command that already accepts some parameters and configuration, and then have extra subcommands that do other things.</p> <section id="the-root-command"> <h3>The Root Command</h3> <p>At the top level, we need a group that can hold all our commands. In this case, we use the basic <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.group" title="click.group"><code>click.group()</code></a> which allows us to register other Click commands below it.</p> <p>For this command, we also want to accept some parameters that configure the state of our tool:</p> <pre data-language="python">import os
import click


class Repo(object):
    def __init__(self, home=None, debug=False):
        self.home = os.path.abspath(home or '.')
        self.debug = debug


@click.group()
@click.option('--repo-home', envvar='REPO_HOME', default='.repo')
@click.option('--debug/--no-debug', default=False,
              envvar='REPO_DEBUG')
@click.pass_context
def cli(ctx, repo_home, debug):
    ctx.obj = Repo(repo_home, debug)
</pre> <p>Let’s understand what this does. We create a group command which can have subcommands. When it is invoked, it will create an instance of a <code>Repo</code> class. This holds the state for our command line tool. In this case, it just remembers some parameters, but at this point it could also start loading configuration files and so on.</p> <p>This state object is then remembered by the context as <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.Context.obj" title="click.Context.obj"><code>obj</code></a>. This is a special attribute where commands are supposed to remember what they need to pass on to their children.</p> <p>In order for this to work, we need to mark our function with <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.pass_context" title="click.pass_context"><code>pass_context()</code></a>, because otherwise, the context object would be entirely hidden from us.</p> </section> <section id="the-first-child-command"> <h3>The First Child Command</h3> <p>Let’s add our first child command to it, the clone command:</p> <pre data-language="python">@cli.command()
@click.argument('src')
@click.argument('dest', required=False)
def clone(src, dest):
    pass
</pre> <p>So now we have a clone command, but how do we get access to the repo? As you can imagine, one way is to use the <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.pass_context" title="click.pass_context"><code>pass_context()</code></a> function which again will make our callback also get the context passed on which we memorized the repo. However, there is a second version of this decorator called <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.pass_obj" title="click.pass_obj"><code>pass_obj()</code></a> which will just pass the stored object, (in our case the repo):</p> <pre data-language="python">@cli.command()
@click.argument('src')
@click.argument('dest', required=False)
@click.pass_obj
def clone(repo, src, dest):
    pass
</pre> </section> <section id="interleaved-commands"> <h3>Interleaved Commands</h3> <p>While not relevant for the particular program we want to build, there is also quite good support for interleaving systems. Imagine for instance that there was a super cool plugin for our version control system that needed a lot of configuration and wanted to store its own configuration as <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.Context.obj" title="click.Context.obj"><code>obj</code></a>. If we would then attach another command below that, we would all of a sudden get the plugin configuration instead of our repo object.</p> <p>One obvious way to remedy this is to store a reference to the repo in the plugin, but then a command needs to be aware that it’s attached below such a plugin.</p> <p>There is a much better system that can be built by taking advantage of the linked nature of contexts. We know that the plugin context is linked to the context that created our repo. Because of that, we can start a search for the last level where the object stored by the context was a repo.</p> <p>Built-in support for this is provided by the <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.make_pass_decorator" title="click.make_pass_decorator"><code>make_pass_decorator()</code></a> factory, which will create decorators for us that find objects (it internally calls into <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.Context.find_object" title="click.Context.find_object"><code>Context.find_object()</code></a>). In our case, we know that we want to find the closest <code>Repo</code> object, so let’s make a decorator for this:</p> <pre data-language="python">pass_repo = click.make_pass_decorator(Repo)
</pre> <p>If we now use <code>pass_repo</code> instead of <code>pass_obj</code>, we will always get a repo instead of something else:</p> <pre data-language="python">@cli.command()
@click.argument('src')
@click.argument('dest', required=False)
@pass_repo
def clone(repo, src, dest):
    pass
</pre> </section> <section id="ensuring-object-creation"> <h3>Ensuring Object Creation</h3> <p>The above example only works if there was an outer command that created a <code>Repo</code> object and stored it in the context. For some more advanced use cases, this might become a problem. The default behavior of <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.make_pass_decorator" title="click.make_pass_decorator"><code>make_pass_decorator()</code></a> is to call <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.Context.find_object" title="click.Context.find_object"><code>Context.find_object()</code></a> which will find the object. If it can’t find the object, <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.make_pass_decorator" title="click.make_pass_decorator"><code>make_pass_decorator()</code></a> will raise an error. The alternative behavior is to use <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.Context.ensure_object" title="click.Context.ensure_object"><code>Context.ensure_object()</code></a> which will find the object, and if it cannot find it, will create one and store it in the innermost context. This behavior can also be enabled for <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.make_pass_decorator" title="click.make_pass_decorator"><code>make_pass_decorator()</code></a> by passing <code>ensure=True</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">pass_repo = click.make_pass_decorator(Repo, ensure=True)
</pre> <p>In this case, the innermost context gets an object created if it is missing. This might replace objects being placed there earlier. In this case, the command stays executable, even if the outer command does not run. For this to work, the object type needs to have a constructor that accepts no arguments.</p> <p>As such it runs standalone:</p> <pre data-language="python">@click.command()
@pass_repo
def cp(repo):
    click.echo(isinstance(repo, Repo))
</pre> <p>As you can see:</p> <pre data-language="shell">$ cp
True
</pre> </section> </section> <section id="lazily-loading-subcommands"> <h2>Lazily Loading Subcommands</h2> <p>Large CLIs and CLIs with slow imports may benefit from deferring the loading of subcommands. The interfaces which support this mode of use are <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.MultiCommand.list_commands" title="click.MultiCommand.list_commands"><code>MultiCommand.list_commands()</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.MultiCommand.get_command" title="click.MultiCommand.get_command"><code>MultiCommand.get_command()</code></a>. A custom <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.MultiCommand" title="click.MultiCommand"><code>MultiCommand</code></a> subclass can implement a lazy loader by storing extra data such that <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.MultiCommand.get_command" title="click.MultiCommand.get_command"><code>MultiCommand.get_command()</code></a> is responsible for running imports.</p> <p>Since the primary case for this is a <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.Group" title="click.Group"><code>Group</code></a> which loads its subcommands lazily, the following example shows a lazy-group implementation.</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="admonition-title">Warning</p> <p>Lazy loading of python code can result in hard to track down bugs, circular imports in order-dependent codebases, and other surprising behaviors.

Some are intuititve, and some are less so.</p> <p>All cases are described with respect to the above example, assuming the main program name is <code>cli</code>.</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>Command resolution. If a user runs <code>cli bar baz</code>, this must first resolve <code>bar</code>, and then resolve <code>baz</code>. Each subcommand resolution step does a lazy load.</li> <li>Helptext rendering. In order to get the short help description of subcommands, <code>cli --help</code> will load <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>. Note that it will still not load <code>baz</code>.</li> <li>Shell completion. In order to get the subcommands of a lazy command, <code>cli &lt;TAB&gt;</code> will need to resolve the subcommands of <code>cli</code>. This process will trigger the lazy loads.</li> </ol> </section> <section id="further-deferring-imports"> <h3>Further Deferring Imports</h3> <p>It is possible to make the process even lazier, but it is generally more difficult the more you want to defer work.</p> <p>For example, subcommands could be represented as a custom <a class="reference internal" href="../api/index.html#click.BaseCommand" title="click.BaseCommand"><code>BaseCommand</code></a> subclass which defers importing the command until it is invoked, but which provides <code>BaseCommand.get_short_help_str()</code> in order to support completions and helptext. More simply, commands can be constructed whose callback functions defer any actual work until after an import.</p> <p>This command definition provides <code>foo</code>, but any of the work associated with importing the “real” callback function is deferred until invocation time:</p> <pre data-language="python">@click.command()
@click.option("-n", type=int)
@click.option("-w", type=str)
def foo(n, w):
    from mylibrary import foo_concrete

    foo_concrete(n, w)
</pre> <p>Because <code>click</code> builds helptext and usage info from options, arguments, and command attributes, it has no awareness that the underlying function is in any way handling a deferred import. Therefore, all <code>click</code>-provided utilities and functionality will work as normal on such a command.</p> </section> </section><div class="_attribution">
