<section id="s-testing-in-django"> <h1 id="testing-in-django">Testing in Django</h1> <p>Automated testing is an extremely useful bug-killing tool for the modern web developer. You can use a collection of tests – a <strong>test suite</strong> – to solve, or avoid, a number of problems:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>When you’re writing new code, you can use tests to validate your code works as expected.</li> <li>When you’re refactoring or modifying old code, you can use tests to ensure your changes haven’t affected your application’s behavior unexpectedly.</li> </ul> <p>Testing a web application is a complex task, because a web application is made of several layers of logic – from HTTP-level request handling, to form validation and processing, to template rendering. With Django’s test-execution framework and assorted utilities, you can simulate requests, insert test data, inspect your application’s output and generally verify your code is doing what it should be doing.</p> <p>The preferred way to write tests in Django is using the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code>unittest</code></a> module built-in to the Python standard library. This is covered in detail in the <a class="reference internal" href="overview.html"><span class="doc">Writing and running tests</span></a> document.</p> <p>You can also use any <em>other</em> Python test framework; Django provides an API and tools for that kind of integration. They are described in the <a class="reference internal" href="advanced.html#other-testing-frameworks"><span class="std std-ref">Using different testing frameworks</span></a> section of <a class="reference internal" href="advanced.html"><span class="doc">Advanced testing topics</span></a>.</p>  <ul> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="overview.html">Writing and running tests</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="tools.html">Testing tools</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="advanced.html">Advanced testing topics</a></li> </ul>  </section><div class="_attribution">
