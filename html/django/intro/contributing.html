Maybe you’ve found a bug in Django that you’d like to see fixed, or maybe there’s a small feature you want added.</p> <p>Contributing back to Django itself is the best way to see your own concerns addressed. This may seem daunting at first, but it’s a well-traveled path with documentation, tooling, and a community to support you.

If you get messages saying that this command could not be found, you’ll have to download and install it, see <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/download">Git’s download page</a>.</p> <p>If you’re not that familiar with Git, you can always find out more about its commands (once it’s installed) by typing <code>git help</code> into the command line.</p>   <h2 id="getting-a-copy-of-django-s-development-version">Getting a copy of Django’s development version</h2> <p id="s-getting-a-copy-of-django-s-development-version">The first step to contributing to Django is to get a copy of the source code. First, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/fork">fork Django on GitHub</a>. Then, from the command line, use the <code>cd</code> command to navigate to the directory where you’ll want your local copy of Django to live.</p> <p>Download the Django source code repository using the following command:</p>       <pre data-language="console">$ git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubName/django.git
</pre>   <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">...\&gt;</span> git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubName/django.git
</pre></div>   <div class="admonition-low-bandwidth-connection admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">Low bandwidth connection?</p> <p class="last">You can add the <code>--depth 1</code> argument to <code>git clone</code> to skip downloading all of Django’s commit history, which reduces data transfer from ~250 MB to ~70 MB.</p> </div> <p>Now that you have a local copy of Django, you can install it just like you would install any package using <code>pip</code>. The most convenient way to do so is by using a <em>virtual environment</em>, which is a feature built into Python that allows you to keep a separate directory of installed packages for each of your projects so that they don’t interfere with each other.</p> <p>It’s a good idea to keep all your virtual environments in one place, for example in <code>.virtualenvs/</code> in your home directory.</p> <p>Create a new virtual environment by running:</p>       <pre data-language="console">$ python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev
</pre>   <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">...\&gt;</span> py -m venv <span class="nv">%HOMEPATH%</span>\.virtualenvs\djangodev
</pre></div>   <p>The path is where the new environment will be saved on your computer.</p> <p>The final step in setting up your virtual environment is to activate it:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ source ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev/bin/activate
</pre> <p>If the <code>source</code> command is not available, you can try using a dot instead:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ . ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev/bin/activate
</pre> <p>You have to activate the virtual environment whenever you open a new terminal window.</p> <div class="admonition-for-windows-users admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">For Windows users</p> <p>To activate your virtual environment on Windows, run:</p> <pre data-language="doscon">...\&gt; %HOMEPATH%\.virtualenvs\djangodev\Scripts\activate.bat
</pre> </div> <p>The name of the currently activated virtual environment is displayed on the command line to help you keep track of which one you are using. Anything you install through <code>pip</code> while this name is displayed will be installed in that virtual environment, isolated from other environments and system-wide packages.</p> <p id="intro-contributing-install-local-copy">Go ahead and install the previously cloned copy of Django:</p>       <pre data-language="console">$ python -m pip install -e /path/to/your/local/clone/django/
</pre>   <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">...\&gt;</span> py -m pip install -e \path\to\your\local\clone\django\
</pre></div>   <p>The installed version of Django is now pointing at your local copy by installing in editable mode. You will immediately see any changes you make to it, which is of great help when writing your first contribution.</p>  <h3 id="creating-projects-with-a-local-copy-of-django">Creating projects with a local copy of Django</h3> <p id="s-creating-projects-with-a-local-copy-of-django">It may be helpful to test your local changes with a Django project. First you have to create a new virtual environment, <a class="reference internal" href="#intro-contributing-install-local-copy"><span class="std std-ref">install the previously cloned local copy of Django in editable mode</span></a>, and create a new Django project outside of your local copy of Django. You will immediately see any changes you make to Django in your new project, which is of great help when writing your first contribution, especially if testing any changes to the UI.</p> <p>You can follow the <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial01.html"><span class="doc">tutorial</span></a> for help in creating a Django project.</p>    <h2 id="running-django-s-test-suite-for-the-first-time">Running Django’s test suite for the first time</h2> <p id="s-running-django-s-test-suite-for-the-first-time">When contributing to Django it’s very important that your code changes don’t introduce bugs into other areas of Django. One way to check that Django still works after you make your changes is by running Django’s test suite. If all the tests still pass, then you can be reasonably sure that your changes work and haven’t broken other parts of Django. If you’ve never run Django’s test suite before, it’s a good idea to run it once beforehand to get familiar with its output.</p> <p>Before running the test suite, enter the Django <code>tests/</code> directory using the <code>cd tests</code> command, and install test dependencies by running:</p>       <pre data-language="console">$ python -m pip install -r requirements/py3.txt
</pre>   <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">...\&gt;</span> py -m pip install -r requirements\py3.txt
</pre></div>   <p>If you encounter an error during the installation, your system might be missing a dependency for one or more of the Python packages. Consult the failing package’s documentation or search the web with the error message that you encounter.</p> <p>Now we are ready to run the test suite. If you’re using GNU/Linux, macOS, or some other flavor of Unix, run:</p>       <pre data-language="console">$ ./runtests.py
</pre>   <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">...\&gt;</span> runtests.py 
</pre></div>   <p>Now sit back and relax. Django’s entire test suite has thousands of tests, and it takes at least a few minutes to run, depending on the speed of your computer.</p> <p>While Django’s test suite is running, you’ll see a stream of characters representing the status of each test as it completes. <code>E</code> indicates that an error was raised during a test, and <code>F</code> indicates that a test’s assertions failed. Both of these are considered to be test failures. Meanwhile, <code>x</code> and <code>s</code> indicated expected failures and skipped tests, respectively. Dots indicate passing tests.</p> <p>Skipped tests are typically due to missing external libraries required to run the test; see <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-unit-tests-dependencies"><span class="std std-ref">Running all the tests</span></a> for a list of dependencies and be sure to install any for tests related to the changes you are making (we won’t need any for this tutorial). Some tests are specific to a particular database backend and will be skipped if not testing with that backend. SQLite is the database backend for the default settings. To run the tests using a different backend, see <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-unit-tests-settings"><span class="std std-ref">Using another settings module</span></a>.</p> <p>Once the tests complete, you should be greeted with a message informing you whether the test suite passed or failed. Since you haven’t yet made any changes to Django’s code, the entire test suite <strong>should</strong> pass. If you get failures or errors make sure you’ve followed all of the previous steps properly. See <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-unit-tests"><span class="std std-ref">Running the unit tests</span></a> for more information.</p> <p>Note that the latest Django “main” branch may not always be stable. When developing against “main”, you can check <a class="reference external" href="https://djangoci.com">Django’s continuous integration builds</a> to determine if the failures are specific to your machine or if they are also present in Django’s official builds. If you click to view a particular build, you can view the “Configuration Matrix” which shows failures broken down by Python version and database backend.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">For this tutorial and the ticket we’re working on, testing against SQLite is sufficient, however, it’s possible (and sometimes necessary) to <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-unit-tests-settings"><span class="std std-ref">run the tests using a different database</span></a>.

Here are the imaginary details:</p> <div class="admonition-ticket-99999-allow-making-toast admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">Ticket #99999 – Allow making toast</p> <p class="last">Django should provide a function <code>django.shortcuts.make_toast()</code> that returns <code>'toast'</code>.</p> </div> <p>We’ll now implement this feature and associated tests.</p>   <h2 id="creating-a-branch">Creating a branch</h2> <p id="s-creating-a-branch">Before making any changes, create a new branch for the ticket:</p>       <pre data-language="console">$ git checkout -b ticket_99999
</pre>   <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">...\&gt;</span> git checkout -b ticket_99999
</pre></div>   <p>You can choose any name that you want for the branch, “ticket_99999” is an example. All changes made in this branch will be specific to the ticket and won’t affect the main copy of the code that we cloned earlier.</p>   <h2 id="writing-some-tests-for-your-ticket">Writing some tests for your ticket</h2> <p id="s-writing-some-tests-for-your-ticket">In most cases, for a contribution to be accepted into Django it has to include tests. For bug fix contributions, this means writing a regression test to ensure that the bug is never reintroduced into Django later on. A regression test should be written in such a way that it will fail while the bug still exists and pass once the bug has been fixed. For contributions containing new features, you’ll need to include tests which ensure that the new features are working correctly. They too should fail when the new feature is not present, and then pass once it has been implemented.</p> <p>A good way to do this is to write your new tests first, before making any changes to the code. This style of development is called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a> and can be applied to both entire projects and single changes. After writing your tests, you then run them to make sure that they do indeed fail (since you haven’t fixed that bug or added that feature yet). If your new tests don’t fail, you’ll need to fix them so that they do. After all, a regression test that passes regardless of whether a bug is present is not very helpful at preventing that bug from reoccurring down the road.</p> <p>Now for our hands-on example.</p>  <h3 id="writing-a-test-for-ticket-99999">Writing a test for ticket #99999</h3> <p id="s-writing-a-test-for-ticket-99999">In order to resolve this ticket, we’ll add a <code>make_toast()</code> function to the <code>django.shortcuts</code> module. First we are going to write a test that tries to use the function and check that its output looks correct.</p> <p>Navigate to Django’s <code>tests/shortcuts/</code> folder and create a new file <code>test_make_toast.py</code>. Add the following code:</p> <pre data-language="python">from django.shortcuts import make_toast
from django.test import SimpleTestCase


class MakeToastTests(SimpleTestCase):
    def test_make_toast(self):
        self.assertEqual(make_toast(), "toast")

    return "toast"
</pre> <p>Now we need to make sure that the test we wrote earlier passes, so we can see whether the code we added is working correctly. Again, navigate to the Django <code>tests/</code> directory and run:</p>       <pre data-language="console">$ ./runtests.py shortcuts
</pre>   <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">...\&gt;</span> runtests.py shortcuts

It contains a ton of useful information and should be your first source for answering any questions you might have.</li> </ul>   <h3 id="finding-your-first-real-ticket">Finding your first real ticket</h3> <p id="s-finding-your-first-real-ticket">Once you’ve looked through some of that information, you’ll be ready to go out and find a ticket of your own to contribute to. Pay special attention to tickets with the “easy pickings” criterion. These tickets are often much simpler in nature and are great for first time contributors. Once you’re familiar with contributing to Django, you can start working on more difficult and complicated tickets.</p> <p>If you just want to get started already (and nobody would blame you!), try taking a look at the list of <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;has_patch=0&amp;easy=1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority">easy tickets without a branch</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;needs_better_patch=1&amp;easy=1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority">easy tickets that have branches which need improvement</a>. If you’re familiar with writing tests, you can also look at the list of <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;needs_tests=1&amp;easy=1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority">easy tickets that need tests</a>. Remember to follow the guidelines about claiming tickets that were mentioned in the link to Django’s documentation on <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/"><span class="doc">claiming tickets and submitting branches</span></a>.</p>   <h3 id="what-s-next-after-creating-a-pull-request">What’s next after creating a pull request?</h3> <p id="s-what-s-next-after-creating-a-pull-request">After a ticket has a branch, it needs to be reviewed by a second set of eyes. After submitting a pull request, update the ticket metadata by setting the flags on the ticket to say “has patch”, “doesn’t need tests”, etc, so others can find it for review. Contributing doesn’t necessarily always mean writing code from scratch. Reviewing open pull requests is also a very helpful contribution.
