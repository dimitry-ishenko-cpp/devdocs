<h1 id="writing-your-first-django-app-part-5">Writing your first Django app, part 5</h1> <p id="s-writing-your-first-django-app-part-5">This tutorial begins where <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial04.html"><span class="doc">Tutorial 4</span></a> left off. We’ve built a web-poll application, and we’ll now create some automated tests for it.</p> <div class="admonition-where-to-get-help admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">Where to get help:</p> <p class="last">If you’re having trouble going through this tutorial, please head over to the <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/faq/help/"><span class="doc">Getting Help</span></a> section of the FAQ.</p> </div>  <h2 id="introducing-automated-testing">Introducing automated testing</h2>  <h3 id="what-are-automated-tests">What are automated tests?</h3> <p id="s-introducing-automated-testing">Tests are routines that check the operation of your code.</p> <p>Testing operates at different levels. Some tests might apply to a tiny detail (<em>does a particular model method return values as expected?</em>) while others examine the overall operation of the software (<em>does a sequence of user inputs on the site produce the desired result?</em>). That’s no different from the kind of testing you did earlier in <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial02.html"><span class="doc">Tutorial 2</span></a>, using the <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/django-admin.html#django-admin-shell"><code>shell</code></a> to examine the behavior of a method, or running the application and entering data to check how it behaves.</p> <p>What’s different in <em>automated</em> tests is that the testing work is done for you by the system. You create a set of tests once, and then as you make changes to your app, you can check that your code still works as you originally intended, without having to perform time consuming manual testing.</p>   <h3 id="why-you-need-to-create-tests">Why you need to create tests</h3> <p id="s-why-you-need-to-create-tests">So why create tests, and why now?</p> <p>You may feel that you have quite enough on your plate just learning Python/Django, and having yet another thing to learn and do may seem overwhelming and perhaps unnecessary. After all, our polls application is working quite happily now; going through the trouble of creating automated tests is not going to make it work any better. If creating the polls application is the last bit of Django programming you will ever do, then true, you don’t need to know how to create automated tests. But, if that’s not the case, now is an excellent time to learn.</p>  <h4 id="tests-will-save-you-time">Tests will save you time</h4> <p id="s-tests-will-save-you-time">Up to a certain point, ‘checking that it seems to work’ will be a satisfactory test. In a more sophisticated application, you might have dozens of complex interactions between components.</p> <p>A change in any of those components could have unexpected consequences on the application’s behavior. Checking that it still ‘seems to work’ could mean running through your code’s functionality with twenty different variations of your test data to make sure you haven’t broken something - not a good use of your time.</p> <p>That’s especially true when automated tests could do this for you in seconds. If something’s gone wrong, tests will also assist in identifying the code that’s causing the unexpected behavior.</p> <p>Sometimes it may seem a chore to tear yourself away from your productive, creative programming work to face the unglamorous and unexciting business of writing tests, particularly when you know your code is working properly.</p> <p>However, the task of writing tests is a lot more fulfilling than spending hours testing your application manually or trying to identify the cause of a newly-introduced problem.</p>   <h4 id="tests-don-t-just-identify-problems-they-prevent-them">Tests don’t just identify problems, they prevent them</h4> <p id="s-tests-don-t-just-identify-problems-they-prevent-them">It’s a mistake to think of tests merely as a negative aspect of development.</p> <p>Without tests, the purpose or intended behavior of an application might be rather opaque. Even when it’s your own code, you will sometimes find yourself poking around in it trying to find out what exactly it’s doing.</p> <p>Tests change that; they light up your code from the inside, and when something goes wrong, they focus light on the part that has gone wrong - <em>even if you hadn’t even realized it had gone wrong</em>.</p>   <h4 id="tests-make-your-code-more-attractive">Tests make your code more attractive</h4> <p id="s-tests-make-your-code-more-attractive">You might have created a brilliant piece of software, but you will find that many other developers will refuse to look at it because it lacks tests; without tests, they won’t trust it. Jacob Kaplan-Moss, one of Django’s original developers, says “Code without tests is broken by design.”</p> <p>That other developers want to see tests in your software before they take it seriously is yet another reason for you to start writing tests.</p>   <h4 id="tests-help-teams-work-together">Tests help teams work together</h4> <p id="s-tests-help-teams-work-together">The previous points are written from the point of view of a single developer maintaining an application. Complex applications will be maintained by teams. Tests guarantee that colleagues don’t inadvertently break your code (and that you don’t break theirs without knowing). If you want to make a living as a Django programmer, you must be good at writing tests!</p>     <h2 id="basic-testing-strategies">Basic testing strategies</h2> <p id="s-basic-testing-strategies">There are many ways to approach writing tests.</p> <p>Some programmers follow a discipline called “<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a>”; they actually write their tests before they write their code. This might seem counter-intuitive, but in fact it’s similar to what most people will often do anyway: they describe a problem, then create some code to solve it. Test-driven development formalizes the problem in a Python test case.</p> <p>More often, a newcomer to testing will create some code and later decide that it should have some tests. Perhaps it would have been better to write some tests earlier, but it’s never too late to get started.</p> <p>Sometimes it’s difficult to figure out where to get started with writing tests. If you have written several thousand lines of Python, choosing something to test might not be easy. In such a case, it’s fruitful to write your first test the next time you make a change, either when you add a new feature or fix a bug.</p> <p>So let’s do that right away.</p>   <h2 id="writing-our-first-test">Writing our first test</h2>  <h3 id="we-identify-a-bug">We identify a bug</h3> <p id="s-writing-our-first-test">Fortunately, there’s a little bug in the <code>polls</code> application for us to fix right away: the <code>Question.was_published_recently()</code> method returns <code>True</code> if the <code>Question</code> was published within the last day (which is correct) but also if the <code>Question</code>’s <code>pub_date</code> field is in the future (which certainly isn’t).</p> <p>Confirm the bug by using the <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/django-admin.html#django-admin-shell"><code>shell</code></a> to check the method on a question whose date lies in the future:</p>       <pre data-language="console">$ python manage.py shell

You might get unexpected results if your <code>TIME_ZONE</code> in <code>settings.py</code> isn’t correct. If you don’t remember setting it earlier, check it before continuing.</p> <p>Next we need to import the test client class (later in <code>tests.py</code> we will use the <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/testing/tools.html#django.test.TestCase" title="django.test.TestCase"><code>django.test.TestCase</code></a> class, which comes with its own client, so this won’t be required):</p> <pre data-language="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; from django.test import Client

</pre> </div>   <h3 id="ideas-for-more-tests">Ideas for more tests</h3> <p id="s-ideas-for-more-tests">We ought to add a similar <code>get_queryset</code> method to <code>ResultsView</code> and create a new test class for that view. It’ll be very similar to what we have just created; in fact there will be a lot of repetition.</p> <p>We could also improve our application in other ways, adding tests along the way. For example, it’s silly that <code>Questions</code> can be published on the site that have no <code>Choices</code>. So, our views could check for this, and exclude such <code>Questions</code>. Our tests would create a <code>Question</code> without <code>Choices</code> and then test that it’s not published, as well as create a similar <code>Question</code> <em>with</em> <code>Choices</code>, and test that it <em>is</em> published.</p> <p>Perhaps logged-in admin users should be allowed to see unpublished <code>Questions</code>, but not ordinary visitors. Again: whatever needs to be added to the software to accomplish this should be accompanied by a test, whether you write the test first and then make the code pass the test, or work out the logic in your code first and then write a test to prove it.</p> <p>At a certain point you are bound to look at your tests and wonder whether your code is suffering from test bloat, which brings us to:</p>    <h2 id="when-testing-more-is-better">When testing, more is better</h2> <p id="s-when-testing-more-is-better">It might seem that our tests are growing out of control. At this rate there will soon be more code in our tests than in our application, and the repetition is unaesthetic, compared to the elegant conciseness of the rest of our code.</p> <p><strong>It doesn’t matter</strong>. Let them grow. For the most part, you can write a test once and then forget about it. It will continue performing its useful function as you continue to develop your program.</p> <p>Sometimes tests will need to be updated. Suppose that we amend our views so that only <code>Questions</code> with <code>Choices</code> are published. In that case, many of our existing tests will fail - <em>telling us exactly which tests need to be amended to bring them up to date</em>, so to that extent tests help look after themselves.</p> <p>At worst, as you continue developing, you might find that you have some tests that are now redundant. Even that’s not a problem; in testing redundancy is a <em>good</em> thing.</p> <p>As long as your tests are sensibly arranged, they won’t become unmanageable. Good rules-of-thumb include having:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>a separate <code>TestClass</code> for each model or view</li> <li>a separate test method for each set of conditions you want to test</li> <li>test method names that describe their function</li> </ul>   <h2 id="further-testing">Further testing</h2> <p id="s-further-testing">This tutorial only introduces some of the basics of testing. There’s a great deal more you can do, and a number of very useful tools at your disposal to achieve some very clever things.</p> <p>For example, while our tests here have covered some of the internal logic of a model and the way our views publish information, you can use an “in-browser” framework such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a> to test the way your HTML actually renders in a browser. These tools allow you to check not just the behavior of your Django code, but also, for example, of your JavaScript. It’s quite something to see the tests launch a browser, and start interacting with your site, as if a human being were driving it! Django includes <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/testing/tools.html#django.test.LiveServerTestCase" title="django.test.LiveServerTestCase"><code>LiveServerTestCase</code></a> to facilitate integration with tools like Selenium.</p> <p>If you have a complex application, you may want to run tests automatically with every commit for the purposes of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a>, so that quality control is itself - at least partially - automated.</p> <p>A good way to spot untested parts of your application is to check code coverage. This also helps identify fragile or even dead code. If you can’t test a piece of code, it usually means that code should be refactored or removed. Coverage will help to identify dead code. See <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/testing/advanced.html#topics-testing-code-coverage"><span class="std std-ref">Integration with coverage.py</span></a> for details.</p> <p><a class="reference internal" href="../topics/testing/index.html"><span class="doc">Testing in Django</span></a> has comprehensive information about testing.</p>   <h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2> <p id="s-what-s-next">For full details on testing, see <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/testing/index.html"><span class="doc">Testing in Django</span></a>.</p> <p>When you’re comfortable with testing Django views, read <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial06.html"><span class="doc">part 6 of this tutorial</span></a> to learn about static files management.</p><div class="_attribution">
