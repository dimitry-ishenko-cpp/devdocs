<section id="s-writing-your-first-django-app-part-8"> <h1 id="writing-your-first-django-app-part-8">Writing your first Django app, part 8</h1> <p>This tutorial begins where <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial07.html"><span class="doc">Tutorial 7</span></a> left off. We’ve built our web-poll application and will now look at third-party packages. One of Django’s strengths is the rich ecosystem of third-party packages. They’re community developed packages that can be used to quickly improve the feature set of an application.</p> <p>This tutorial will show how to add <a class="extlink-pypi reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/">Django Debug Toolbar</a>, a commonly used third-party package. The Django Debug Toolbar has ranked in the top three most used third-party packages in the Django Developers Survey in recent years.</p> <div class="admonition-where-to-get-help admonition"> <p class="admonition-title">Where to get help:</p> <p>If you’re having trouble going through this tutorial, please head over to the <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/faq/help/"><span class="doc">Getting Help</span></a> section of the FAQ.</p> </div> <section id="s-installing-django-debug-toolbar"> <h2 id="installing-django-debug-toolbar">Installing Django Debug Toolbar</h2> <p>Django Debug Toolbar is a useful tool for debugging Django web applications. It’s a third-party package that is maintained by the community organization <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django-commons">Django Commons</a>. The toolbar helps you understand how your application functions and to identify problems. It does so by providing panels that provide debug information about the current request and response.</p> <p>To install a third-party application like the toolbar, you need to install the package by running the below command within an activated virtual environment. This is similar to our earlier step to <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/install.html#installing-official-release"><span class="std std-ref">install Django</span></a>.</p>       <pre data-language="console">$ python -m pip install django-debug-toolbar
</pre>   <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">...\&gt;</span> py -m pip install django-debug-toolbar
</pre></div>   <p>Third-party packages that integrate with Django need some post-installation setup to integrate them with your project. Often you will need to add the package’s Django app to your <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/settings.html#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS"><code>INSTALLED_APPS</code></a> setting. Some packages need other changes, like additions to your URLconf (<code>urls.py</code>).</p> <p>Django Debug Toolbar requires several setup steps. Follow them in <a class="reference external" href="https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html">its installation guide</a>. The steps are not duplicated in this tutorial, because as a third-party package, it may change separately to Django’s schedule.</p> <p>Once installed, you should be able to see the DjDT “handle” on the right side of the browser window when you browse to <code>http://localhost:8000/admin/</code>. Click it to open the debug toolbar and use the tools in each panel. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/panels.html">panels documentation page</a> for more information on what the panels show.</p> </section> <section id="s-getting-help-from-others"> <h2 id="getting-help-from-others">Getting help from others</h2> <p>At some point you will run into a problem, for example the toolbar may not render. When this happens and you’re unable to resolve the issue yourself, there are options available to you.</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>If the problem is with a specific package, check if there’s a troubleshooting of FAQ in the package’s documentation. For example the Django Debug Toolbar has a <a class="reference external" href="https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tips.html">Tips section</a> that outlines troubleshooting options.</li> <li>Search for similar issues on the package’s issue tracker. Django Debug Toolbar’s is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django-commons/django-debug-toolbar/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc">on GitHub</a>.</li> <li>Consult the <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/">Django Forum</a>.</li> <li>Join the <a class="reference external" href="https://chat.djangoproject.com">Django Discord server</a>.</li> </ol> </section> <section id="s-installing-other-third-party-packages"> <h2 id="installing-other-third-party-packages">Installing other third-party packages</h2> <p>There are many more third-party packages, which you can find using the fantastic Django resource, <a class="reference external" href="https://djangopackages.org/">Django Packages</a>.</p> <p>It can be difficult to know what third-party packages you should use. This depends on your needs and goals. Sometimes it’s fine to use a package that’s in its alpha state. Other times, you need to know it’s production ready. <a class="reference external" href="https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/11/04/the-well-maintained-test/">Adam Johnson has a blog post</a> that outlines a set of characteristics that qualifies a package as “well maintained”. Django Packages shows data for some of these characteristics, such as when the package was last updated.</p> <p>As Adam points out in his post, when the answer to one of the questions is “no”, that’s an opportunity to contribute.</p> </section> <section id="s-what-s-next"> <h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2> <p>The beginner tutorial ends here.
