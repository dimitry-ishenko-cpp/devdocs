<section id="s-unicode-data"> <h1 id="unicode-data">Unicode data</h1> <p>Django supports Unicode data everywhere.</p> <p>This document tells you what you need to know if you’re writing applications that use data or templates that are encoded in something other than ASCII.</p> <section id="s-creating-the-database"> <h2 id="creating-the-database">Creating the database</h2> <p>Make sure your database is configured to be able to store arbitrary string data. Normally, this means giving it an encoding of UTF-8 or UTF-16. If you use a more restrictive encoding – for example, latin1 (iso8859-1) – you won’t be able to store certain characters in the database, and information will be lost.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>MySQL users, refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/charset-database.html">MySQL manual</a> for details on how to set or alter the database character set encoding.</li> <li>PostgreSQL users, refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/multibyte.html#MULTIBYTE-SETTING">PostgreSQL manual</a> for details on creating databases with the correct encoding.</li> <li>Oracle users, refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/nlspg/index.html">Oracle manual</a> for details on how to set (<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/nlspg/choosing-character-set.html">section 2</a>) or alter (<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/nlspg/character-set-migration.html">section 11</a>) the database character set encoding.</li> <li>SQLite users, there is nothing you need to do.

They also automatically convert strings retrieved from the database into strings. You don’t even need to tell Django what encoding your database uses: that is handled transparently.</p> <p>For more, see the section “The database API” below.</p> </section> <section id="s-general-string-handling"> <h2 id="general-string-handling">General string handling</h2> <p>Whenever you use strings with Django – e.g., in database lookups, template rendering or anywhere else – you have two choices for encoding those strings. You can use normal strings or bytestrings (starting with a ‘b’).</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="admonition-title">Warning</p> <p>A bytestring does not carry any information with it about its encoding. For that reason, we have to make an assumption, and Django assumes that all bytestrings are in UTF-8.</p> <p>If you pass a string to Django that has been encoded in some other format, things will go wrong in interesting ways. Usually, Django will raise a <code>UnicodeDecodeError</code> at some point.</p> </div> <p>If your code only uses ASCII data, it’s safe to use your normal strings, passing them around at will, because ASCII is a subset of UTF-8.</p> <p>Don’t be fooled into thinking that if your <a class="reference internal" href="settings.html#std-setting-DEFAULT_CHARSET"><code>DEFAULT_CHARSET</code></a> setting is set to something other than <code>'utf-8'</code> you can use that other encoding in your bytestrings! <a class="reference internal" href="settings.html#std-setting-DEFAULT_CHARSET"><code>DEFAULT_CHARSET</code></a> only applies to the strings generated as the result of template rendering (and email). Django will always assume UTF-8 encoding for internal bytestrings. The reason for this is that the <a class="reference internal" href="settings.html#std-setting-DEFAULT_CHARSET"><code>DEFAULT_CHARSET</code></a> setting is not actually under your control (if you are the application developer). It’s under the control of the person installing and using your application – and if that person chooses a different setting, your code must still continue to work. Ergo, it cannot rely on that setting.</p> <p>In most cases when Django is dealing with strings, it will convert them to strings before doing anything else. So, as a general rule, if you pass in a bytestring, be prepared to receive a string back in the result.</p> <section id="s-translated-strings"> <h3 id="translated-strings">Translated strings</h3> <p>Aside from strings and bytestrings, there’s a third type of string-like object you may encounter when using Django. The framework’s internationalization features introduce the concept of a “lazy translation” – a string that has been marked as translated but whose actual translation result isn’t determined until the object is used in a string. This feature is useful in cases where the translation locale is unknown until the string is used, even though the string might have originally been created when the code was first imported.</p> <p>Normally, you won’t have to worry about lazy translations. Just be aware that if you examine an object and it claims to be a <code>django.utils.functional.__proxy__</code> object, it is a lazy translation. Calling <code>str()</code> with the lazy translation as the argument will generate a string in the current locale.</p> <p>For more details about lazy translation objects, refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/i18n/index.html"><span class="doc">internationalization</span></a> documentation.</p> </section> <section id="s-useful-utility-functions"> <h3 id="useful-utility-functions">Useful utility functions</h3> <p>Because some string operations come up again and again, Django ships with a few useful functions that should make working with string and bytestring objects a bit easier.</p> <section id="s-conversion-functions"> <h4 id="conversion-functions">Conversion functions</h4> <p>The <code>django.utils.encoding</code> module contains a few functions that are handy for converting back and forth between strings and bytestrings.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>smart_str(s, encoding='utf-8', strings_only=False, errors='strict')</code> converts its input to a string. The <code>encoding</code> parameter specifies the input encoding. (For example, Django uses this internally when processing form input data, which might not be UTF-8 encoded.) The <code>strings_only</code> parameter, if set to True, will result in Python numbers, booleans and <code>None</code> not being converted to a string (they keep their original types). The <code>errors</code> parameter takes any of the values that are accepted by Python’s <code>str()</code> function for its error handling.</li> <li>
<code>force_str(s, encoding='utf-8', strings_only=False, errors='strict')</code> is identical to <code>smart_str()</code> in almost all cases. The difference is when the first argument is a <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/i18n/translation.html#lazy-translations"><span class="std std-ref">lazy translation</span></a> instance. While <code>smart_str()</code> preserves lazy translations, <code>force_str()</code> forces those objects to a string (causing the translation to occur). Normally, you’ll want to use <code>smart_str()</code>. However, <code>force_str()</code> is useful in template tags and filters that absolutely <em>must</em> have a string to work with, not just something that can be converted to a string.</li> <li>
<code>smart_bytes(s, encoding='utf-8', strings_only=False, errors='strict')</code> is essentially the opposite of <code>smart_str()</code>. It forces the first argument to a bytestring. The <code>strings_only</code> parameter has the same behavior as for <code>smart_str()</code> and <code>force_str()</code>. This is slightly different semantics from Python’s builtin <code>str()</code> function, but the difference is needed in a few places within Django’s internals.</li> </ul> <p>Normally, you’ll only need to use <code>force_str()</code>. Call it as early as possible on any input data that might be either a string or a bytestring, and from then on, you can treat the result as always being a string.</p> </section> <section id="s-uri-and-iri-handling"> <h4 id="id1">URI and IRI handling</h4> <p>Web frameworks have to deal with URLs (which are a type of IRI). One requirement of URLs is that they are encoded using only ASCII characters. However, in an international environment, you might need to construct a URL from an <a class="rfc reference external" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987.html" id="index-0"><strong>IRI</strong></a> – very loosely speaking, a <a class="rfc reference external" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986.html" id="index-1"><strong>URI</strong></a> that can contain Unicode characters. Use these functions for quoting and converting an IRI to a URI:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The <a class="reference internal" href="utils.html#django.utils.encoding.iri_to_uri" title="django.utils.encoding.iri_to_uri"><code>django.utils.encoding.iri_to_uri()</code></a> function, which implements the conversion from IRI to URI as required by <a class="rfc reference external" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987.html#section-3.1" id="index-2"><strong>RFC 3987 Section 3.1</strong></a>.</li> <li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.quote" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code>urllib.parse.quote()</code></a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.quote_plus" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code>urllib.parse.quote_plus()</code></a> functions from Python’s standard library.</li> </ul> <p>These two groups of functions have slightly different purposes, and it’s important to keep them straight. Normally, you would use <code>quote()</code> on the individual portions of the IRI or URI path so that any reserved characters such as ‘&amp;’ or ‘%’ are correctly encoded. Then, you apply <code>iri_to_uri()</code> to the full IRI and it converts any non-ASCII characters to the correct encoded values.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Technically, it isn’t correct to say that <code>iri_to_uri()</code> implements the full algorithm in the IRI specification. It doesn’t (yet) perform the international domain name encoding portion of the algorithm.</p> </div> <p>The <code>iri_to_uri()</code> function will not change ASCII characters that are otherwise permitted in a URL. So, for example, the character ‘%’ is not further encoded when passed to <code>iri_to_uri()</code>. This means you can pass a full URL to this function and it will not mess up the query string or anything like that.</p> <p>An example might clarify things here:</p> <pre data-language="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; from urllib.parse import quote
&gt;&gt;&gt; from django.utils.encoding import iri_to_uri
&gt;&gt;&gt; quote("Paris &amp; Orléans")
'Paris%20%26%20Orl%C3%A9ans'
&gt;&gt;&gt; iri_to_uri("/favorites/François/%s" % quote("Paris &amp; Orléans"))
'/favorites/Fran%C3%A7ois/Paris%20%26%20Orl%C3%A9ans'
</pre> <p>If you look carefully, you can see that the portion that was generated by <code>quote()</code> in the second example was not double-quoted when passed to <code>iri_to_uri()</code>. This is a very important and useful feature. It means that you can construct your IRI without worrying about whether it contains non-ASCII characters and then, right at the end, call <code>iri_to_uri()</code> on the result.</p> <p>Similarly, Django provides <a class="reference internal" href="utils.html#django.utils.encoding.uri_to_iri" title="django.utils.encoding.uri_to_iri"><code>django.utils.encoding.uri_to_iri()</code></a> which implements the conversion from URI to IRI as per <a class="rfc reference external" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987.html#section-3.2" id="index-3"><strong>RFC 3987 Section 3.2</strong></a>.</p> <p>An example to demonstrate:</p> <pre data-language="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; from django.utils.encoding import uri_to_iri
&gt;&gt;&gt; uri_to_iri("/%E2%99%A5%E2%99%A5/?utf8=%E2%9C%93")
'/♥♥/?utf8=✓'
&gt;&gt;&gt; uri_to_iri("%A9hello%3Fworld")
'%A9hello%3Fworld'
</pre> <p>In the first example, the UTF-8 characters are unquoted. In the second, the percent-encodings remain unchanged because they lie outside the valid UTF-8 range or represent a reserved character.</p> <p>Both <code>iri_to_uri()</code> and <code>uri_to_iri()</code> functions are idempotent, which means the following is always true:</p> <pre data-language="python">iri_to_uri(iri_to_uri(some_string)) == iri_to_uri(some_string)
uri_to_iri(uri_to_iri(some_string)) == uri_to_iri(some_string)
</pre> <p>So you can safely call it multiple times on the same URI/IRI without risking double-quoting problems.</p> </section> </section> </section> <section id="s-models"> <h2 id="models">Models</h2> <p>Because all strings are returned from the database as <code>str</code> objects, model fields that are character based (CharField, TextField, URLField, etc.) will contain Unicode values when Django retrieves data from the database. This is <em>always</em> the case, even if the data could fit into an ASCII bytestring.</p> <p>You can pass in bytestrings when creating a model or populating a field, and Django will convert it to strings when it needs to.</p> <section id="s-taking-care-in-get-absolute-url"> <h3 id="taking-care-in-get-absolute-url">Taking care in <code>get_absolute_url()</code>
</h3> <p>URLs can only contain ASCII characters. If you’re constructing a URL from pieces of data that might be non-ASCII, be careful to encode the results in a way that is suitable for a URL. The <a class="reference internal" href="urlresolvers.html#django.urls.reverse" title="django.urls.reverse"><code>reverse()</code></a> function handles this for you automatically.</p> <p>If you’re constructing a URL manually (i.e., <em>not</em> using the <code>reverse()</code> function), you’ll need to take care of the encoding yourself. In this case, use the <code>iri_to_uri()</code> and <code>quote()</code> functions that were documented <a class="reference internal" href="#id1">above</a>. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">from urllib.parse import quote
from django.utils.encoding import iri_to_uri


def get_absolute_url(self):
    url = "/person/%s/?x=0&amp;y=0" % quote(self.location)
    return iri_to_uri(url)
</pre> <p>This function returns a correctly encoded URL even if <code>self.location</code> is something like “Jack visited Paris &amp; Orléans”. (In fact, the <code>iri_to_uri()</code> call isn’t strictly necessary in the above example, because all the non-ASCII characters would have been removed in quoting in the first line.)</p> </section> </section> <section id="s-templates"> <h2 id="templates">Templates</h2> <p>Use strings when creating templates manually:</p> <pre data-language="python">from django.template import Template

t2 = Template("This is a string template.")
</pre> <p>But the common case is to read templates from the filesystem. If your template files are not stored with a UTF-8 encoding, adjust the <a class="reference internal" href="settings.html#std-setting-TEMPLATES"><code>TEMPLATES</code></a> setting. The built-in <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/templates.html#module-django.template.backends.django" title="django.template.backends.django"><code>django</code></a> backend provides the <code>'file_charset'</code> option to change the encoding used to read files from disk.</p> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="settings.html#std-setting-DEFAULT_CHARSET"><code>DEFAULT_CHARSET</code></a> setting controls the encoding of rendered templates. This is set to UTF-8 by default.</p> <section id="s-template-tags-and-filters"> <h3 id="template-tags-and-filters">Template tags and filters</h3> <p>A couple of tips to remember when writing your own template tags and filters:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Always return strings from a template tag’s <code>render()</code> method and from template filters.</li> <li>Use <code>force_str()</code> in preference to <code>smart_str()</code> in these places. Tag rendering and filter calls occur as the template is being rendered, so there is no advantage to postponing the conversion of lazy translation objects into strings. It’s easier to work solely with strings at that point.</li> </ul> </section> </section> <section id="s-files"> <h2 id="unicode-files">Files</h2> <p>If you intend to allow users to upload files, you must ensure that the environment used to run Django is configured to work with non-ASCII file names. If your environment isn’t configured correctly, you’ll encounter <code>UnicodeEncodeError</code> exceptions when saving files with file names or content that contains non-ASCII characters.</p> <p>Filesystem support for UTF-8 file names varies and might depend on the environment. Check your current configuration in an interactive Python shell by running:</p> <pre data-language="python">import sys

sys.getfilesystemencoding()
</pre> <p>This should output “UTF-8”.</p> <p>The <code>LANG</code> environment variable is responsible for setting the expected encoding on Unix platforms. Consult the documentation for your operating system and application server for the appropriate syntax and location to set this variable. See the <a class="reference internal" href="../howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi.html"><span class="doc">How to use Django with Apache and mod_wsgi</span></a> for examples.</p> <p>In your development environment, you might need to add a setting to your <code>~.bashrc</code> analogous to:</p> <pre data-language="shell">export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
</pre> </section> <section id="s-form-submission"> <h2 id="form-submission">Form submission</h2> <p>HTML form submission is a tricky area. There’s no guarantee that the submission will include encoding information, which means the framework might have to guess at the encoding of submitted data.</p> <p>Django adopts a “lazy” approach to decoding form data. The data in an <code>HttpRequest</code> object is only decoded when you access it. In fact, most of the data is not decoded at all. Only the <code>HttpRequest.GET</code> and <code>HttpRequest.POST</code> data structures have any decoding applied to them. Those two fields will return their members as Unicode data. All other attributes and methods of <code>HttpRequest</code> return data exactly as it was submitted by the client.</p> <p>By default, the <a class="reference internal" href="settings.html#std-setting-DEFAULT_CHARSET"><code>DEFAULT_CHARSET</code></a> setting is used as the assumed encoding for form data. If you need to change this for a particular form, you can set the <code>encoding</code> attribute on an <code>HttpRequest</code> instance. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">def some_view(request):
    # We know that the data must be encoded as KOI8-R (for some reason).
    request.encoding = "koi8-r"
    ...
</pre> <p>You can even change the encoding after having accessed <code>request.GET</code> or <code>request.POST</code>, and all subsequent accesses will use the new encoding.</p> <p>Most developers won’t need to worry about changing form encoding, but this is a useful feature for applications that talk to legacy systems whose encoding you cannot control.</p> <p>Django does not decode the data of file uploads, because that data is normally treated as collections of bytes, rather than strings. Any automatic decoding there would alter the meaning of the stream of bytes.</p> </section> </section><div class="_attribution">
