<h1 id="local-value-configuration">  Local Value Configuration </h1> <p>Local values assign a name to an expression, that can then be used multiple times within a module.</p> <p>Comparing modules to functions in a traditional programming language, if <a href="variables.html">variables</a> are analogous to function arguments and <a href="outputs.html">outputs</a> are analogous to function return values then <em>local values</em> are comparable to a function's local variables.</p> <p>This page assumes you're already familiar with <a href="syntax.html">the configuration syntax</a>.</p> <h2 id="examples">  Examples </h2> <p>Local values are defined in <code>locals</code> blocks:</p> <pre data-language="ruby"># Ids for multiple sets of EC2 instances, merged together
locals {
  instance_ids = "${concat(aws_instance.blue.*.id, aws_instance.green.*.id)}"
}

# A computed default name prefix
locals {
  default_name_prefix = "${var.project_name}-web"
  name_prefix         = "${var.name_prefix != "" ? var.name_prefix : local.default_name_prefix}"
}

# Local values can be interpolated elsewhere using the "local." prefix.
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "files" {
  bucket = "${local.name_prefix}-files"
  # ...
}
</pre>
<p>Named local maps can be merged with local maps to implement common or default values:</p> <pre data-language="ruby"># Define the common tags for all resources
locals {
  common_tags = {
    Component   = "awesome-app"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

# Create a resource that blends the common tags with instance-specific tags.
resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = "${merge(
    local.common_tags,
    map(
      "Name", "awesome-app-server",
      "Role", "server"
    )
  )}"
}
</pre>
<h2 id="description">  Description </h2> <p>The <code>locals</code> block defines one or more local variables within a module. Each <code>locals</code> block can have as many locals as needed, and there can be any number of <code>locals</code> blocks within a module.</p> <p>The names given for the items in the <code>locals</code> block must be unique throughout a module. The given value can be any expression that is valid within the current module.</p> <p>The expression of a local value can refer to other locals, but as usual reference cycles are not allowed. That is, a local cannot refer to itself or to a variable that refers (directly or indirectly) back to it.</p> <p>It's recommended to group together logically-related local values into a single block, particularly if they depend on each other. This will help the reader understand the relationships between variables. Conversely, prefer to define <em>unrelated</em> local values in <em>separate</em> blocks, and consider annotating each block with a comment describing any context common to all of the enclosed locals.</p><div class="_attribution">
