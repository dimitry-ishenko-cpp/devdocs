<h1 id="provisioners">  Provisioners </h1> <p>Provisioners are used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction. Provisioners can be used to bootstrap a resource, cleanup before destroy, run configuration management, etc.</p> <p>Provisioners are added directly to any resource:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${self.private_ip} &gt; file.txt"
  }
}
</pre>
<p>For provisioners other than local execution, you must specify <a href="connection.html">connection settings</a> so Terraform knows how to communicate with the resource.</p> <h2 id="creation-time-provisioners">  Creation-Time Provisioners </h2> <p>Provisioners by default run when the resource they are defined within is created. Creation-time provisioners are only run during <em>creation</em>, not during updating or any other lifecycle. They are meant as a means to perform bootstrapping of a system.</p> <p>If a creation-time provisioner fails, the resource is marked as <strong>tainted</strong>. A tainted resource will be planned for destruction and recreation upon the next <code>terraform apply</code>. Terraform does this because a failed provisioner can leave a resource in a semi-configured state. Because Terraform cannot reason about what the provisioner does, the only way to ensure proper creation of a resource is to recreate it. This is tainting.</p> <p>You can change this behavior by setting the <code>on_failure</code> attribute, which is covered in detail below.</p> <h2 id="destroy-time-provisioners">  Destroy-Time Provisioners </h2> <p>If <code>when = "destroy"</code> is specified, the provisioner will run when the resource it is defined within is <em>destroyed</em>.</p> <p>Destroy provisioners are run before the resource is destroyed. If they fail, Terraform will error and rerun the provisioners again on the next <code>terraform apply</code>. Due to this behavior, care should be taken for destroy provisioners to be safe to run multiple times.</p> <p>Destroy-time provisioners can only run if they remain in the configuration at the time a resource is destroyed. If a resource block with a destroy-time provisioner is removed entirely from the configuration, its provisioner configurations are removed along with it and thus the destroy provisioner won't run. To work around this, a multi-step process can be used to safely remove a resource with a destroy-time provisioner:</p> <ul> <li>Update the resource configuration to include <code>count = 0</code>. </li> <li>Apply the configuration to destroy any existing instances of the resource, including running the destroy provisioner. </li> <li>Remove the resource block entirely from configuration, along with its <code>provisioner</code> blocks. </li> <li>Apply again, at which point no further action should be taken since the resources were already destroyed. </li> </ul> <p>This limitation may be addressed in future versions of Terraform. For now, destroy-time provisioners must be used sparingly and with care.</p> <h2 id="multiple-provisioners">  Multiple Provisioners </h2> <p>Multiple provisioners can be specified within a resource. Multiple provisioners are executed in the order they're defined in the configuration file.</p> <p>You may also mix and match creation and destruction provisioners. Only the provisioners that are valid for a given operation will be run. Those valid provisioners will be run in the order they're defined in the configuration file.</p> <p>Example of multiple provisioners:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo first"
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo second"
  }
}
</pre>
<h2 id="failure-behavior">  Failure Behavior </h2> <p>By default, provisioners that fail will also cause the Terraform apply itself to error. The <code>on_failure</code> setting can be used to change this. The allowed values are:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><a href="#quot-continue-quot-"><code>"continue"</code></a> - Ignore the error and continue with creation or destruction.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#quot-fail-quot-"><code>"fail"</code></a> - Error (the default behavior). If this is a creation provisioner, taint the resource.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command    = "echo ${self.private_ip} &gt; file.txt"
    on_failure = "continue"
  }
}
