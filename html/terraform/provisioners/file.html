<h1 id="file-provisioner">  File Provisioner </h1> <p>The <code>file</code> provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the machine executing Terraform to the newly created resource. The <code>file</code> provisioner supports both <code>ssh</code> and <code>winrm</code> type <a href="connection.html">connections</a>.</p> <h2 id="example-usage">  Example usage </h2> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  # Copies the myapp.conf file to /etc/myapp.conf
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "conf/myapp.conf"
    destination = "/etc/myapp.conf"
  }

  # Copies the string in content into /tmp/file.log
  provisioner "file" {
    content     = "ami used: ${self.ami}"
    destination = "/tmp/file.log"
  }

  # Copies the configs.d folder to /etc/configs.d
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "conf/configs.d"
    destination = "/etc"
  }

  # Copies all files and folders in apps/app1 to D:/IIS/webapp1
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "apps/app1/"
    destination = "D:/IIS/webapp1"
  }
}

<h2 id="argument-reference">  Argument Reference </h2> <p>The following arguments are supported:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><a href="#source"><code>source</code></a> - This is the source file or folder. It can be specified as relative to the current working directory or as an absolute path. This attribute cannot be specified with <code>content</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#content"><code>content</code></a> - This is the content to copy on the destination. If destination is a file, the content will be written on that file, in case of a directory a file named <code>tf-file-content</code> is created. It's recommended to use a file as the destination. A <a href="../providers/template/d/file.html"><code>template_file</code></a> might be referenced in here, or any interpolation syntax. This attribute cannot be specified with <code>source</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#destination"><code>destination</code></a> - (Required) This is the destination path. It must be specified as an absolute path.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="directory-uploads">  Directory Uploads </h2> <p>The file provisioner is also able to upload a complete directory to the remote machine. When uploading a directory, there are a few important things you should know.</p> <p>First, when using the <code>ssh</code> connection type the destination directory must already exist. If you need to create it, use a remote-exec provisioner just prior to the file provisioner in order to create the directory. When using the <code>winrm</code> connection type the destination directory will be created for you if it doesn't already exist.</p> <p>Next, the existence of a trailing slash on the source path will determine whether the directory name will be embedded within the destination, or whether the destination will be created. An example explains this best:</p> <p>If the source is <code>/foo</code> (no trailing slash), and the destination is <code>/tmp</code>, then the contents of <code>/foo</code> on the local machine will be uploaded to <code>/tmp/foo</code> on the remote machine. The <code>foo</code> directory on the remote machine will be created by Terraform.</p> <p>If the source, however, is <code>/foo/</code> (a trailing slash is present), and the destination is <code>/tmp</code>, then the contents of <code>/foo</code> will be uploaded directly into <code>/tmp</code>.</p> <p>This behavior was adopted from the standard behavior of <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync">rsync</a>.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Under the covers, rsync may or may not be used.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
