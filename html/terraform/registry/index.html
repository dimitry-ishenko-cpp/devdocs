<h1 id="terraform-registry">  Terraform Registry </h1> <p>The <a href="https://registry.terraform.io">Terraform Registry</a> is a repository of modules written by the Terraform community. The registry can help you get started with Terraform more quickly, see examples of how Terraform is written, and find pre-made modules for infrastructure components you require.</p> <p>The Terraform Registry is integrated directly into Terraform to make consuming modules easy. See <a href="modules/use.html#using-modules">the usage information</a>.</p> <p>You can also publish your own modules on the Terraform Registry. You may use the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io">public registry</a> for public modules. For private modules, you can use a <a href="private.html">Private Registry</a>, or <a href="../modules/sources.html">reference repositories and other sources directly</a>. Some features are available only for registry modules, such as versioning and documentation generation.</p> <p>Use the navigation to the left to learn more about using the registry.</p><div class="_attribution">
