<h1 id="template_dir">  template_dir </h1> <p>Renders a directory containing templates into a separate directory of corresponding rendered files.</p> <p><code>template_dir</code> is similar to <a href="../d/file.html"><code>template_file</code></a> but it walks a given source directory and treats every file it encounters as a template, rendering it to a corresponding file in the destination directory.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note</strong> When working with local files, Terraform will detect the resource as having been deleted each time a configuration is applied on a new machine where the destination dir is not present and will generate a diff to create it. This may cause "noise" in diffs in environments where configurations are routinely applied by many different users or within automation systems.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="example-usage">  Example Usage </h2> <p>The following example shows how one might use this resource to produce a directory of configuration files to upload to a compute instance, using Amazon EC2 as a placeholder.</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "template_dir" "config" {
  source_dir      = "${path.module}/instance_config_templates"
  destination_dir = "${path.cwd}/instance_config"

  vars {
    consul_addr = "${var.consul_addr}"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  ami           = "${var.server_ami}"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  connection {
    # ...connection configuration...
  }

  provisioner "file" {
    # Referencing the template_dir resource ensures that it will be
    # created or updated before this aws_instance resource is provisioned.
    source      = "${template_dir.config.destination_dir}"
    destination = "/etc/myapp"
  }
}

variable "consul_addr" {}

variable "server_ami" {}
</pre>
<h2 id="argument-reference">  Argument Reference </h2> <p>The following arguments are supported:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><a href="#source_dir"><code>source_dir</code></a> - (Required) Path to the directory where the files to template reside.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#destination_dir"><code>destination_dir</code></a> - (Required) Path to the directory where the templated files will be written.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#vars"><code>vars</code></a> - (Optional) Variables for interpolation within the template. Note that variables must all be primitives. Direct references to lists or maps will cause a validation error.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Any required parent directories of <code>destination_dir</code> will be created automatically, and any pre-existing file or directory at that location will be deleted before template rendering begins.</p> <p>After rendering this resource remembers the content of both the source and destination directories in the Terraform state, and will plan to recreate the output directory if any changes are detected during the plan phase.</p> <p>Note that it is <em>not</em> safe to use the <code>file</code> interpolation function to read files create by this resource, since that function can be evaluated before the destination directory has been created or updated. It <em>is</em> safe to use the generated files with resources that directly take filenames as arguments, as long as the path is constructed using the <code>destination_dir</code> attribute to create a dependency relationship with the <code>template_dir</code> resource.</p> <h2 id="template-syntax">  Template Syntax </h2> <p>The syntax of the template files is the same as <a href="../../../configuration/interpolation.html">standard interpolation syntax</a>, but you only have access to the variables defined in the <code>vars</code> section.</p> <p>To access interpolations that are normally available to Terraform configuration (such as other variables, resource attributes, module outputs, etc.) you can expose them via <code>vars</code> as shown below:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "template_dir" "init" {
  # ...

  vars {
    foo  = "${var.foo}"
    attr = "${aws_instance.foo.private_ip}"
  }
}
</pre>
<h2 id="attributes">  Attributes </h2> <p>This resource exports the following attributes:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#destination_dir-1"><code>destination_dir</code></a> - The destination directory given in configuration. Interpolate this attribute into other resource configurations to create a dependency to ensure that the destination directory is populated before another resource attempts to read it. </li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
