<h1 id="random-provider">  Random Provider </h1> <p>The "random" provider allows the use of randomness within Terraform configurations. This is a <em>logical provider</em>, which means that it works entirely within Terraform's logic, and doesn't interact with any other services.</p> <p>Unconstrained randomness within a Terraform configuration would not be very useful, since Terraform's goal is to converge on a fixed configuration by applying a diff. Because of this, the "random" provider provides an idea of <em>managed randomness</em>: it provides resources that generate random values during their creation and then hold those values steady until the inputs are changed.</p> <p>Even with these resources, it is advisable to keep the use of randomness within Terraform configuration to a minimum, and retain it for special cases only; Terraform works best when the configuration is well-defined, since its behavior can then be more readily predicted.</p> <p>Unless otherwise stated within the documentation of a specific resource, this provider's results are <strong>not</strong> sufficiently random for cryptographic use.</p> <p>For more information on the specific resources available, see the links in the navigation bar. Read on for information on the general patterns that apply to this provider's resources.</p> <h2 id="resource-quot-keepers-quot-">  Resource "Keepers" </h2> <p>As noted above, the random resources generate randomness only when they are created; the results produced are stored in the Terraform state and re-used until the inputs change, prompting the resource to be recreated.</p> <p>The resources all provide a map argument called <code>keepers</code> that can be populated with arbitrary key/value pairs that should be selected such that they remain the same until new random values are desired.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "random_id" "server" {
  keepers = {
    # Generate a new id each time we switch to a new AMI id
    ami_id = "${var.ami_id}"
  }

  byte_length = 8
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  tags = {
    Name = "web-server ${random_id.server.hex}"
  }

  # Read the AMI id "through" the random_id resource to ensure that
  # both will change together.
  ami = "${random_id.server.keepers.ami_id}"

  # ... (other aws_instance arguments) ...
}
</pre>
<p>Resource "keepers" are optional. The other arguments to each resource must <em>also</em> remain constant in order to retain a random result.</p> <p>To force a random result to be replaced, the <code>taint</code> command can be used to produce a new result on the next run.</p><div class="_attribution">
