## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Required) The name of the bucket to read the object from
* `key` - (Required) The full path to the object inside the bucket
* `version_id` - (Optional) Specific version ID of the object returned (defaults to latest version)

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `body` - Object data (see **limitations above** to understand cases in which this field is actually available)
* `cache_control` - Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
* `content_disposition` - Specifies presentational information for the object.
* `content_encoding` - Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.
* `content_language` - The language the content is in.
* `content_length` - Size of the body in bytes.
* `content_type` - A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.
* `etag` - [ETag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag) generated for the object (an MD5 sum of the object content in case it's not encrypted)
* `expiration` - If the object expiration is configured (see [object lifecycle management](http://docs.telefonicaopencloud.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html)), the field includes this header. It includes the expiry-date and rule-id key value pairs providing object expiration information. The value of the rule-id is URL encoded.
* `expires` - The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.
* `last_modified` - Last modified date of the object in RFC1123 format (e.g. `Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 MST`)
* `metadata` - A map of metadata stored with the object in S3
* `server_side_encryption` - If the object is stored using server-side encryption (KMS or Amazon S3-managed encryption key), this field includes the chosen encryption and algorithm used.
* `sse_kms_key_id` - If present, specifies the ID of the Key Management Service (KMS) master encryption key that was used for the object.
* `storage_class` - [Storage class](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html) information of the object. Available for all objects except for `Standard` storage class objects.
* `version_id` - The latest version ID of the object returned.
* `website_redirect_location` - If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.
* `tags`  - A mapping of tags assigned to the object.
