<h1 id="vsphere_folder">  vsphere_folder </h1> <p>The <code>vsphere_folder</code> resource can be used to manage vSphere inventory folders. The resource supports creating folders of the 5 major types - datacenter folders, host and cluster folders, virtual machine folders, datastore folders, and network folders.</p> <p>Paths are always relative to the specific type of folder you are creating. Subfolders are discovered by parsing the relative path specified in <code>path</code>, so <code>foo/bar</code> will create a folder named <code>bar</code> in the parent folder <code>foo</code>, as long as that folder exists.</p> <h2 id="example-usage">  Example Usage </h2> <p>The basic example below creates a virtual machine folder named <code>terraform-test-folder</code> in the default datacenter's VM hierarchy.</p> <pre data-language="ruby">data "vsphere_datacenter" "dc" {}

resource "vsphere_folder" "folder" {
  path          = "terraform-test-folder"
  type          = "vm"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.dc.id}"
}
</pre>
<h3 id="example-with-subfolders">  Example with subfolders </h3> <p>The below example builds off of the above by first creating a folder named <code>terraform-test-parent</code>, and then locating <code>terraform-test-folder</code> in that folder. To ensure the parent is created first, we create an interpolation dependency off the parent's <code>path</code> attribute.</p> <p>Note that if you change parents (for example, went from the above basic configuration to this one), your folder will be moved to be under the correct parent.</p> <pre data-language="ruby">data "vsphere_datacenter" "dc" {}

resource "vsphere_folder" "parent" {
  path          = "terraform-test-parent"
  type          = "vm"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.dc.id}"
}

resource "vsphere_folder" "folder" {
  path          = "${vsphere_folder.parent.path}/terraform-test-folder"
  type          = "vm"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.dc.id}"
}
</pre>
<h2 id="argument-reference">  Argument Reference </h2> <p>The following arguments are supported:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#path"><code>path</code></a> - (Required) The path of the folder to be created. This is relative to the root of the type of folder you are creating, and the supplied datacenter. For example, given a default datacenter of <code>default-dc</code>, a folder of type <code>vm</code> (denoting a virtual machine folder), and a supplied folder of <code>terraform-test-folder</code>, the resulting path would be <code>/default-dc/vm/terraform-test-folder</code>. </li> </ul> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <code>path</code> can be modified - the resulting behavior is dependent on what section of <code>path</code> you are modifying. If you are modifying the parent (so any part before the last <code>/</code>), your folder will be moved to that new parent. If modifying the name (the part after the last <code>/</code>), your folder will be renamed.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>
<a href="#type"><code>type</code></a> - (Required) The type of folder to create. Allowed options are <code>datacenter</code> for datacenter folders, <code>host</code> for host and cluster folders, <code>vm</code> for virtual machine folders, <code>datastore</code> for datastore folders, and <code>network</code> for network folders. Forces a new resource if changed. </li> <li>
<a href="#datacenter_id"><code>datacenter_id</code></a> - The ID of the datacenter the folder will be created in. Required for all folder types except for datacenter folders. Forces a new resource if changed. </li> <li>
<a href="#tags"><code>tags</code></a> - (Optional) The IDs of any tags to attach to this resource. See <a href="tag.html#using-tags-in-a-supported-resource">here</a> for a reference on how to apply tags. </li> </ul> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Tagging support is unsupported on direct ESXi connections and requires vCenter 6.0 or higher.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>
<a href="#custom_attributes"><code>custom_attributes</code></a> - (Optional) Map of custom attribute ids to attribute value strings to set for folder. See <a href="custom_attribute.html#using-custom-attributes-in-a-supported-resource">here</a> for a reference on how to set values for custom attributes. </li> </ul> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Custom attributes are unsupported on direct ESXi connections and require vCenter.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="attribute-reference">  Attribute Reference </h2> <p>The only attribute that this resource exports is the <code>id</code>, which is set to the <a href="../index.html#use-of-managed-object-references-by-the-vsphere-provider">managed object ID</a> of the folder.</p> <h2 id="importing">  Importing </h2> <p>An existing folder can be <a href="../../../import/index.html">imported</a> into this resource via its full path, via the following command:</p> <pre>terraform import vsphere_folder.folder /default-dc/vm/terraform-test-folder
</pre>
<p>The above command would import the folder from our examples above, the VM folder named <code>terraform-test-folder</code> located in the datacenter named <code>default-dc</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
