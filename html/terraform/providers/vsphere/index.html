<h1 id="vmware-vsphere-provider">  VMware vSphere Provider </h1> <p>The VMware vSphere provider gives Terraform the ability to work with VMware vSphere Products, notably <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html">vCenter Server</a> and <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html">ESXi</a>. This provider can be used to manage many aspects of a VMware vSphere environment, including virtual machines, standard and distributed networks, datastores, and more.</p> <p>Use the navigation on the left to read about the various resources and data sources supported by the provider.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This provider requires API write access and hence is not supported on a free ESXi license.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="example-usage">  Example Usage </h2> <p>The following abridged example demonstrates a current basic usage of the provider to launch a virtual machine using the <a href="r/virtual_machine.html"><code>vsphere_virtual_machine</code> resource</a>.

<p>See the sidebar for usage information on all of the resources, which will have examples specific to their own use cases.</p> <h2 id="argument-reference">  Argument Reference </h2> <p>The following arguments are used to configure the VMware vSphere Provider:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#user"><code>user</code></a> - (Required) This is the username for vSphere API operations. Can also be specified with the <code>VSPHERE_USER</code> environment variable. </li> <li>
<a href="#password"><code>password</code></a> - (Required) This is the password for vSphere API operations. Can also be specified with the <code>VSPHERE_PASSWORD</code> environment variable. </li> <li>
<a href="#vsphere_server"><code>vsphere_server</code></a> - (Required) This is the vCenter server name for vSphere API operations. Can also be specified with the <code>VSPHERE_SERVER</code> environment variable. </li> <li>
<a href="#allow_unverified_ssl"><code>allow_unverified_ssl</code></a> - (Optional) Boolean that can be set to true to disable SSL certificate verification. This should be used with care as it could allow an attacker to intercept your auth token. If omitted, default value is <code>false</code>. Can also be specified with the <code>VSPHERE_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SSL</code> environment variable. </li> </ul> <h3 id="session-persistence-options">  Session persistence options </h3> <p>The provider also provides session persistence options that can be configured below. These can help when using Terraform in a way where session limits could be normally reached by creating a new session for every run, such as a large amount of concurrent or consecutive Terraform runs in a short period of time.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Session keys are as good as user credentials for as long as the session is valid for - handle them with care and delete them when you know you will no longer need them.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>
<a href="#persist_session"><code>persist_session</code></a> - (Optional) Persist the SOAP and REST client sessions to disk. Default: <code>false</code>. Can also be specified by the <code>VSPHERE_PERSIST_SESSION</code> environment variable. </li> <li>
<a href="#vim_session_path"><code>vim_session_path</code></a> - (Optional) The direcotry to save the VIM SOAP API session to. Default: <code>${HOME}/.govmomi/sessions</code>. Can also be specified by the <code>VSPHERE_VIM_SESSION_PATH</code> environment variable. </li> <li>
<a href="#rest_session_path"><code>rest_session_path</code></a> - (Optional) The directory to save the REST API session (used for tags) to. Default: <code>${HOME}/.govmomi/rest_sessions</code>. Can also be specified by the <code>VSPHERE_REST_SESSION_PATH</code> environment variable. </li> </ul> <h4 id="govc-terraform-session-interoperability">  govc/Terraform session interoperability </h4> <p>Note that the session format used to save VIM SOAP sessions is the same used with <a href="https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc">govc</a>. If you use govc as part of your provisioning process, Terraform will use the saved session if present and if <code>persist_session</code> is enabled.</p> <h3 id="debugging-options">  Debugging options </h3> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The following options can leak sensitive data and should only be enabled when instructed to do so by HashiCorp for the purposes of troubleshooting issues with the provider, or when attempting to perform your own troubleshooting. Use them at your own risk and do not leave them enabled!</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>
<a href="#client_debug"><code>client_debug</code></a> - (Optional) When <code>true</code>, the provider logs SOAP calls made to the vSphere API to disk. The log files are logged to <code>${HOME}/.govmomi</code>. Can also be specified with the <code>VSPHERE_CLIENT_DEBUG</code> environment variable. </li> <li>
<a href="#client_debug_path"><code>client_debug_path</code></a> - (Optional) Override the default log path. Can also be specified with the <code>VSPHERE_CLIENT_DEBUG_PATH</code> environment variable. </li> <li>
<a href="#client_debug_path_run"><code>client_debug_path_run</code></a> - (Optional) A specific subdirectory in <code>client_debug_path</code> to use for debugging calls for this particular Terraform configuration. All data in this directory is removed at the start of the Terraform run. Can also be specified with the <code>VSPHERE_CLIENT_DEBUG_PATH_RUN</code> environment variable. </li> </ul> <h2 id="notes-on-required-privileges">  Notes on Required Privileges </h2> <p>When using a non-administrator account to perform Terraform tasks, keep in mind that most Terraform resources perform operations in a CRUD-like fashion and require both read and write privileges to the resources they are managing. Make sure that the user has appropriate read-write access to the resources you need to work with. Read-only access should be sufficient when only using data sources on some features. You can read more about vSphere permissions and user management <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-5372F580-5C23-4E9C-8A4E-EF1B4DD9033E.html">here</a>.</p> <p>There are a couple of exceptions to keep in mind when setting up a restricted provisioning user:</p> <h3 id="tags">  Tags </h3> <p>If your vSphere version supports <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-E8E854DD-AA97-4E0C-8419-CE84F93C4058.html">tags</a>, keep in mind that Terraform will always attempt to read tags from a resource, even if you do not have any tags defined. Ensure that your user has access to at least read tags, or else you will encounter errors.</p> <h3 id="events">  Events </h3> <p>Likewise, some Terraform resources will attempt to read event data from vSphere to check for certain events (such as virtual machine customization or power events). Ensure that your user has access to read event data.</p> <h2 id="use-of-managed-object-references-by-the-vsphere-provider">  Use of Managed Object References by the vSphere Provider </h2> <p>Unlike the vSphere client, many resources in the vSphere Terraform provider take Managed Object IDs (or UUIDs when provided and practical) when referring to placement parameters and upstream resources. This provides a stable interface for providing necessary data to downstream resources, in addition to minimizing the bugs that can arise from the flexibility in how an individual object's name or inventory path can be supplied.</p> <p>There are several data sources (such as <a href="d/datacenter.html"><code>vsphere_datacenter</code></a>, <a href="d/host.html"><code>vsphere_host</code></a>, <a href="d/resource_pool.html"><code>vsphere_resource_pool</code></a>, <a href="d/datastore.html"><code>vsphere_datastore</code></a>, and <a href="d/network.html"><code>vsphere_network</code></a>) that assist with searching for a specific resource in Terraform. For usage details on a specific data source, look for the appropriate link in the sidebar. In addition, most vSphere resources in Terraform supply the managed object ID (or UUID, when it makes more sense) as the <code>id</code> attribute, which can be supplied to downstream resources that should depend on the parent.</p> <h3 id="locating-managed-object-ids">  Locating Managed Object IDs </h3> <p>There are certain points in time that you may need to locate the managed object ID of a specific vSphere resource yourself. A couple of methods are documented below.</p> <h4 id="via-govc">  Via <code>govc</code> </h4> <p><a href="https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc">govc</a> is an vSphere CLI built on <a href="https://github.com/vmware/govmomi">govmomi</a>, the vSphere Go SDK. It has a robust inventory browser command that can also be used to list managed object IDs.</p> <p>To get all the necessary data in a single output, use <code>govc ls -l -i PATH</code>. Sample output is below:</p> <pre>$ govc ls -l -i /dc1/vm
VirtualMachine:vm-123 /dc1/vm/foobar
Folder:group-v234 /dc1/vm/subfolder
</pre>
<p>To do a reverse search, supply the <code>-L</code> switch:</p> <pre>$ govc ls -i -l -L VirtualMachine:vm-123
VirtualMachine:vm-123 /dc1/vm/foobar
</pre>
<p>For details on setting up govc, see the <a href="https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc">homepage</a>.</p> <h4 id="via-the-vsphere-managed-object-browser-mob-">  Via the vSphere Managed Object Browser (MOB) </h4> <p>The Managed Object Browser (MOB) allows one to browse the entire vSphere inventory as it's presented to the API. It's normally accessed via <code>https://VSPHERE_SERVER/mob</code>. For more information, see <a href="#">here</a>.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The MOB also offers API method invocation capabilities, and for security reasons should be used sparingly. Modern vSphere installations may have the MOB disabled by default, at the very least on ESXi systems.
