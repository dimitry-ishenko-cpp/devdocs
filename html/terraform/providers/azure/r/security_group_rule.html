As a result; in the event that one of the Rules on one of the Groups is modified by external factors, Terraform cannot reason as to whether or not that change should be propagated to the others; let alone choose one changed Rule configuration over another in case of a conflic. As such; <code>terraform refresh</code> only checks that the rule is still defined for each of the specified <code>security_group_names</code>; ignoring the actual parameters of the Rule and <strong>not</strong> updating the state with regards to them.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="example-usage">  Example Usage </h2> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "azure_security_group" "web" {
