<p>You'll need to provide your Scaleway organization <strong>access key</strong> and <strong>token</strong>.</p> <p>Your access key can be found on your Scaleway control panel, in the <em>Credentials</em> tab of the management panes. It is under the <em>Tokens</em> subsection, but is labelled seperately as <strong>access key</strong>.</p> <p>Your <strong>token</strong> can be generated by selecting to "Create new token" under the same subsection as above. This does not require further input, but giving each token a friendly-name is suggested.</p> <p>If you do not want to put credentials in your configuration file, you can leave them out:</p> <pre>provider "scaleway" {
  region       = "par1"
}
</pre>
<p>...and instead set these environment variables:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>SCALEWAY_ORGANIZATION</strong>: Your Scaleway <code>organization</code> access key </li> <li>
<strong>SCALEWAY_TOKEN</strong>: Your API access <code>token</code>, generated by you </li> <li>
<strong>SCALEWAY_REGION</strong>: The Scaleway region </li> </ul> <h2 id="volume-usage">  Volume usage </h2> <p>You can add volumes to baremetal instances. The minimal size of increment is 50GB and you can add at most 15 different volumes on an instance.</p> <p>Additional volumes cannot be added to virtual cloud servers.</p> <p>Check out the list of different instances on the <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/pricing">pricing page</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
