<h1 id="softlayer-provider">  SoftLayer Provider </h1> <p>The SoftLayer provider is used to manage SoftLayer resources.</p> <p>Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The SoftLayer provider is new as of Terraform 0.6.16. It is ready to be used but many features are still being added. If there is a SoftLayer feature missing, please report it in the GitHub repo.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="example-usage">  Example Usage </h2> <p>Here is an example that will setup the following:</p> <ul> <li>An SSH key resource. </li> <li>A virtual server resource that uses an existing SSH key. </li> <li>A virtual server resource using an existing SSH key and a Terraform managed SSH key (created as <code>test_key_1</code> in the example below). </li> </ul> <p>Add the below to a file called <code>sl.tf</code> and run the <code>terraform</code> command from the same directory:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">provider "softlayer" {
  username = ""
  api_key  = ""
}

# This will create a new SSH key that will show up under the \
# Devices&gt;Manage&gt;SSH Keys in the SoftLayer console.
resource "softlayer_ssh_key" "test_key_1" {
  name       = "test_key_1"

  # Windows Example:
  # public_key = "${file(\"C:\ssh\keys\path\id_rsa_test_key_1.pub\")}"
}

# Virtual Server created with existing SSH Key already in SoftLayer \
# inventory and not created using this Terraform template.

<p>You'll need to provide your SoftLayer username and API key, so that Terraform can connect. If you don't want to put credentials in your configuration file, you can leave them out:</p> <pre>provider "softlayer" {}
</pre>
<p>...and instead set these environment variables:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>SOFTLAYER_USERNAME</strong>: Your SoftLayer username </li> <li>
<strong>SOFTLAYER_API_KEY</strong>: Your API key </li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
