<h1 id="upgrading-the-consul-terraform-provider">  Upgrading the Consul Terraform Provider </h1> <p>This page includes details on our compatibility promise and guidelines to follow when upgrading between versions of the provider. Whenever possible, we recommend verifying upgrades in isolated test environments.</p> <h2 id="upgrading-to-2-0-0">  Upgrading to 2.0.0 </h2> <p>There were several major deprecation notices introduced in 2.0.0. This reviews the details of each and provides migration instructions to the appropriate resources.</p> <h3 id="deprecation-of-consul_agent_self">  Deprecation of consul_agent_self </h3> <p>The <code>consul_agent_self</code> data source will be removed in the next major version of the provider. As a result, we recommend moving to the new <a href="d/agent_config.html"><code>consul_agent_config</code></a> data source.</p> <p>The <code>consul_agent_config</code> resource returns far less attributes, so as a result it may not provide all necessary functionality. Consul does still provide this data via API but <a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/upgrade-specific.html#config-section-of-agent-self-endpoint-has-changed">promises no compatibility across versions</a>, therefore it is being removed from this provider.</p> <h3 id="deprecation-of-consul_agent_service">  Deprecation of consul_agent_service </h3> <p>The <code>consul_agent_service</code> resource will be removed in the next major version of the provider. As a result, we recommend moving to the <a href="r/service.html"><code>consul_service</code></a> resource.</p> <p>This resource has been updated to use the correct catalog APIs in place of service registration APIs. The <code>consul_agent_service</code> resource previously also used the service registration API designed for registration against an agent running on a local node. Because Terraform is intended to be run externally to the cluster, and for other internal reasons, this API was the incorrect one to use.</p> <p>View migration instructions <a href="upgrading.html#migrating-to-consul_service-or-consul_node-resources" title="Migrate to consul_service or consul_node">here</a>.</p> <h3 id="migrating-to-consul_service-or-consul_node-resources">  Migrating to consul_service or consul_node resources </h3> <p>Migration to the <code>consul_service</code> resources are possible in two ways. Both require the configuration to be modified.</p> <p><strong>From <code>consul_agent_service</code> to <code>consul_service</code>:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Rename <code>consul_agent_service</code> resources to <code>consul_service</code> in the Terraform configuration files. </li> <li>Add the <code>node</code> attribute where the service is currently registered, retrievable by <a href="https://www.consul.io/api/catalog.html#list-nodes-for-service">querying the catalog</a> or using the UI. This new attribute is required. </li> <li>For a small number of resources, the first class <a href="../../commands/state/rm.html"><code>state rm</code></a> and <a href="../../import/usage.html"><code>import</code></a> commands can be used to first remove the old resource from the state, and then import it under the new resource name. </li> <li>For a large number of resources, edit the state file directly to rename every resource at the same time (replace all instances of <code>consul_agent_service</code> with <code>consul_service</code>). This requires understanding the consequences and guidelines for <a href="../../backends/state.html#manual-state-pull-push">editing state files</a>, so please read those. </li> </ol> <p>After following these steps, <code>terraform plan</code> should show no changes.</p> <p><strong>From <code>consul_catalog_entry</code> to <code>consul_service</code> or <code>consul_node</code>:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Copy the attributes from the <code>service {}</code> or <code>node {}</code> blocks into new <code>consul_service</code> or <code>consul_node</code> resources in the Terraform configuration files. </li> <li>For a small number of resources, the first class <a href="../../commands/state/rm.html"><code>state rm</code></a> and <a href="../../import/usage.html"><code>import</code></a> commands can be used to first remove the old resource from the state, and then import it under the new resource name. The <code>node</code> attribute will need to be added to services. </li> </ol> <h3 id="modifications-to-consul_service">  Modifications to consul_service </h3> <p>The <code>consul_service</code> resource has been modified to use catalog APIs in place of service registration APIs for creating services in the Consul catalog. This should be a functionally compatible change, and create or read services as prior. It now replaces <code>consul_catalog_entry</code> (the <code>service {}</code> block) and <code>consul_agent_service</code>. The <code>node</code> attribute is now required and the node must exist.</p> <h3 id="deprecation-of-consul_catalog_entry">  Deprecation of consul_catalog_entry </h3> <p>The <code>consul_catalog_entry</code> resource will be removed in the next major version of the provider. As a result, we recommend moving to the <a href="r/service.html"><code>consul_service</code></a> or <a href="r/node.html"><code>consul_node</code></a> resources.</p> <p>These resources have been updated (or created) to use the correct catalog APIs as with <code>consul_catalog_entry</code>, but provide a first-class resource name.</p> <p>View migration instructions <a href="upgrading.html#migrating-to-consul_service-or-consul_node-resources" title="Migrate to consul_service or consul_node">here</a>.</p> <h3 id="renaming-of-catalog-data-sources">  Renaming of Catalog Data Sources </h3> <p><code>consul_catalog_nodes</code>, <code>consul_catalog_services</code>, and <code>consul_catalog_service</code> have been renamed to <code>consul_nodes</code>, <code>consul_services</code>, and <code>consul_service</code> respectively. The prior naming will continue to work, but in the long term it may be deprecated and removed. This is to present a more consistent and intuitive naming convention for the resources.</p><div class="_attribution">
