<h1 id="consul_key_prefix">  consul_key_prefix </h1> <p>Allows Terraform to manage a "namespace" of Consul keys that share a common name prefix.</p> <p>Like <code>consul_keys</code>, this resource can write values into the Consul key/value store, but <em>unlike</em> <code>consul_keys</code> this resource can detect and remove extra keys that have been added some other way, thus ensuring that rogue data added outside of Terraform will be removed on the next run.</p> <p>This resource is thus useful in the case where Terraform is exclusively managing a set of related keys.</p> <p>To avoid accidentally clobbering matching data that existed in Consul before a <code>consul_key_prefix</code> resource was created, creation of a key prefix instance will fail if any matching keys are already present in the key/value store. If any conflicting data is present, you must first delete it manually.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>Warning</strong> After this resource is instantiated, Terraform takes control over <em>all</em> keys with the given path prefix, and will remove any matching keys that are not present in the configuration. It will also delete <em>all</em> keys under the given prefix when a <code>consul_key_prefix</code> resource is destroyed, even if those keys were created outside of Terraform.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="example-usage">  Example Usage </h2> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "consul_key_prefix" "myapp_config" {

<p><a href="#subkeys"><code>subkeys</code></a> - (Required) A mapping from subkey name (which will be appended to the given <code>path_prefix</code>) to the value that should be stored at that key.
