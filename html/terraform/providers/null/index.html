<h1 id="null-provider">  Null Provider </h1> <p>The <code>null</code> provider is a rather-unusual provider that has constructs that intentionally do nothing. This may sound strange, and indeed these constructs do not need to be used in most cases, but they can be useful in various situations to help orchestrate tricky behavior or work around limitations.</p> <p>The documentation of each feature of this provider, accessible via the navigation, gives examples of situations where these constructs may prove useful.</p> <p>Usage of the <code>null</code> provider can make a Terraform configuration harder to understand. While it can be useful in certain cases, it should be applied with care and other solutions preferred when available.</p><div class="_attribution">
