<h1 id="aws_elastic_beanstalk_application_version">  aws_elastic_beanstalk_application_version </h1> <p>Provides an Elastic Beanstalk Application Version Resource. Elastic Beanstalk allows you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications.</p> <p>This resource creates a Beanstalk Application Version that can be deployed to a Beanstalk Environment.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>NOTE on Application Version Resource:</strong> When using the Application Version resource with multiple <a href="elastic_beanstalk_environment.html">Elastic Beanstalk Environments</a> it is possible that an error may be returned when attempting to delete an Application Version while it is still in use by a different environment. To work around this you can: </p>
<ol> <li>Create each environment in a separate AWS account</li> <li>Create your <code>aws_elastic_beanstalk_application_version</code> resources with a unique names in your Elastic Beanstalk Application. For example &lt;revision&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <h2 id="example-usage">  Example Usage </h2> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "aws_s3_bucket" "default" {
