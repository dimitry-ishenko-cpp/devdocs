<h1 id="community-gardening-summer-2018">  Community Gardening - Summer 2018 </h1> <p>On June 21, 2018 the Terraform AWS team is going to put together a virtual, all time zones (best we can), community gardening session for the Terraform AWS provider, inspired by <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Gardening">Go's gardening concept</a>. We plan to do this for other Terraform providers and OSS projects eventually.</p> <p>We have some amazing contributors to AWS and want to get them more involved. This allows people with all levels of AWS knowledge to participate from small, medium, and larger infrastructures. Beginners will have an opportunity to get positive support from more advanced users and HashiCorp will provide participants for quick knowledge.</p> <h2 id="what-to-expect">  What to Expect </h2> <p>What do we plan to do first?</p> <ul> <li>Weeding </li> </ul> <p>Why are we starting here?</p> <ul> <li>We currently have 1600 issues for AWS. </li> <li>There are certainly duplicates </li> <li>Bugs that have been fixed </li> <li>Bugs that need to be fixed that we do not have time for due to volume </li> </ul> <p>What we are giving away for participating?</p> <ul> <li>Sweatshirts for the top 5 people who close the most issues via bug closure or finding duplicates and closing issues </li> <li>T-shirts for the next top 10 people who close the most issues via bug closure or finding duplicates and closing issues </li> <li>HashiCorp mug for the next top 10 who close the most issues via bug closure or finding duplicates and closing issues </li> <li>Stickers for everyone. </li> </ul> <p>If you are going to be at HashiDays or HashiConf, let us know and we will set the goodies aside for you.
