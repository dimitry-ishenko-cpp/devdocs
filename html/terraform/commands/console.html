<h1 id="command-console">  Command: console </h1> <p>The <code>terraform console</code> command creates an interactive console for using <a href="../configuration/interpolation.html">interpolations</a>.</p> <h2 id="usage">  Usage </h2> <p>Usage: <code>terraform console [options] [dir]</code></p> <p>This opens an interactive console for experimenting with interpolations. This is useful for testing interpolations before using them in configurations as well as interacting with an existing <a href="../state/index.html">state</a>.</p> <p>If a state file doesn't exist, the console still works and can be used to experiment with supported interpolation functions. Try entering some basic math such as <code>1 + 5</code> to see.</p> <p>The <code>dir</code> argument can be used to open a console for a specific Terraform configuration directory. This will load any state from that directory as well as the configuration. This defaults to the current working directory. The <code>console</code> command does not require Terraform state or configuration to function.</p> <p>The command-line flags are all optional. The list of available flags are:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#state-path"><code>-state=path</code></a> - Path to the state file. Defaults to <code>terraform.tfstate</code>. A state file doesn't need to exist. </li> </ul> <p>You can close the console with the <code>exit</code> command or by using Control-C or Control-D.</p> <h2 id="scripting">  Scripting </h2> <p>The <code>terraform console</code> command can be used in non-interactive scripts by piping newline-separated commands to it. Only the output from the final command is outputted unless an error occurs earlier.</p> <p>An example is shown below:</p> <pre data-language="shell">$ echo "1 + 5" | terraform console
6
</pre>
<h2 id="remote-state">  Remote State </h2> <p>The <code>terraform console</code> command will read configured state even if it is <a href="../state/remote.html">remote</a>. This is great for scripting state reading in CI environments or other remote scenarios.</p> <p>After configuring remote state, run a <code>terraform remote pull</code> command to sync state locally. The <code>terraform console</code> command will use this state for operations.</p> <p>Because the console currently isn't able to modify state in any way, this is a one way operation and you don't need to worry about remote state conflicts in any way.</p><div class="_attribution">
