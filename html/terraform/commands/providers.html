<h1 id="command-providers">  Command: providers </h1> <p>The <code>terraform providers</code> command prints information about the providers used in the current configuration.</p> <p>Provider dependencies are created in several different ways:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>Explicit use of a <code>provider</code> block in configuration, optionally including a version constraint.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Use of any resource belonging to a particular provider in a <code>resource</code> or <code>data</code> block in configuration.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Existence of any resource instance belonging to a particular provider in the current <em>state</em>. For example, if a particular resource is removed from configuration, it continues to create a dependency on its provider until its instances have been destroyed.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This command gives an overview of all of the current dependencies, as an aid to understanding why a particular provider is needed.</p> <h2 id="usage">  Usage </h2> <p>Usage: <code>terraform providers [config-path]</code></p> <p>Pass an explicit configuration path to override the default of using the current working directory.</p><div class="_attribution">
