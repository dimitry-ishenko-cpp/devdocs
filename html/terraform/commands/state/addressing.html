<h1 id="resource-addressing">  Resource Addressing </h1> <p>The <code>terraform state</code> subcommands make heavy use of resource addressing for targeting and filtering specific resources and modules within the state.</p> <p>Resource addressing is a common feature of Terraform that is used in multiple locations. For example, resource addressing syntax is also used for the <code>-target</code> flag for apply and plan commands.</p> <p>Because resource addressing is unified across Terraform, it is documented in a single place rather than duplicating it in multiple locations. You can find the <a href="../../internals/resource-addressing.html">resource addressing documentation here</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
