<h1 id="cli-configuration-file-terraformrc-terraform-rc-">  CLI Configuration File (<code>.terraformrc</code>/<code>terraform.rc</code>) </h1> <p>The CLI configuration file configures per-user settings for CLI behaviors, which apply across all Terraform working directories. This is separate from <a href="../configuration/index.html">your infrastructure configuration</a>.</p> <h2 id="location">  Location </h2> <p>The configuration is placed in a single file whose location depends on the host operating system:</p> <ul> <li>On Windows, the file must be named named <code>terraform.rc</code> and placed in the relevant user's "Application Data" directory. The physical location of this directory depends on your Windows version and system configuration; use <code>$env:APPDATA</code> in PowerShell to find its location on your system. </li> <li>On all other systems, the file must be named <code>.terraformrc</code> (note the leading period) and placed directly in the home directory of the relevant user. </li> </ul> <p>On Windows, beware of Windows Explorer's default behavior of hiding filename extensions. Terraform will not recognize a file named <code>terraform.rc.txt</code> as a CLI configuration file, even though Windows Explorer may <em>display</em> its name as just <code>terraform.rc</code>. Use <code>dir</code> from PowerShell or Command Prompt to confirm the filename.</p> <h2 id="configuration-file-syntax">  Configuration File Syntax </h2> <p>The configuration file uses the same <em>HCL</em> syntax as <code>.tf</code> files, but with different attributes and blocks. The following example illustrates the general syntax; see the following section for information on the meaning of each of these settings:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">plugin_cache_dir   = "$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"
disable_checkpoint = true
</pre>
<h2 id="available-settings">  Available Settings </h2> <p>The following settings can be set in the CLI configuration file:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><a href="#disable_checkpoint"><code>disable_checkpoint</code></a> — when set to <code>true</code>, disables <a href="index.html#upgrade-and-security-bulletin-checks">upgrade and security bulletin checks</a> that require reaching out to HashiCorp-provided network services.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#disable_checkpoint_signature"><code>disable_checkpoint_signature</code></a> — when set to <code>true</code>, allows the upgrade and security bulletin checks described above but disables the use of an anonymous id used to de-duplicate warning messages.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#plugin_cache_dir"><code>plugin_cache_dir</code></a> — enables <a href="../configuration/providers.html#provider-plugin-cache">plugin caching</a> and specifies, as a string, the location of the plugin cache directory.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#credentials"><code>credentials</code></a> — provides credentials for use with Terraform Enterprise's <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/registry/index.html">private module registry.</a> This is only necessary when running Terraform on the command line; runs managed by Terraform Enterprise can access private modules automatically.</p> <p>This setting is a repeatable block, where the block label is a hostname (either <code>app.terraform.io</code> or the hostname of your private install) and the block body contains a <code>token</code> attribute. Whenever Terraform requests module data from that hostname, it will authenticate with that token.</p> <pre data-language="ruby">credentials "app.terraform.io" {
  token = "xxxxxx.atlasv1.zzzzzzzzzzzzz"
}
</pre>
<blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The credentials hostname must match the hostname in your module sources. If your Terraform Enterprise instance is available at multiple hostnames, use one of them consistently. (The SaaS version of Terraform Enterprise responds to API calls at both its newer hostname, app.terraform.io, and its historical hostname, atlas.hashicorp.com.)</p> </blockquote> </li> </ul> <h2 id="deprecated-settings">  Deprecated Settings </h2> <p>The following settings are supported for backward compatibility but are no longer recommended for use:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#providers"><code>providers</code></a> - a configuration block that allows specifying the locations of specific plugins for each named provider. This mechanism is deprecated because it is unable to specify a version number for each plugin, and thus it does not co-operate with the plugin versioning mechansim. Instead, place the plugin executable files in <a href="../configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins">the third-party plugins directory</a>. </li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
