<h1 id="operations-plan-apply-etc-">  Operations (plan, apply, etc.) </h1> <p>Some backends support the ability to run operations (<code>refresh</code>, <code>plan</code>, <code>apply</code>, etc.) remotely. Terraform will continue to look and behave as if they're running locally while they in fact run on a remote machine.</p> <p>Backends should not modify the actual infrastructure change behavior of these commands. They will only modify how they're invoked.</p> <p>At the time of writing, no backends support this. This shouldn't be linked in the sidebar yet!</p><div class="_attribution">
