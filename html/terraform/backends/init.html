<h1 id="backend-initialization">  Backend Initialization </h1> <p>Terraform must initialize any configured backend before use. This can be done by simply running <code>terraform init</code>.</p> <p>The <code>terraform init</code> command should be run by any member of your team on any Terraform configuration as a first step. It is safe to execute multiple times and performs all the setup actions required for a Terraform environment, including initializing the backend.</p> <p>The <code>init</code> command must be called:</p> <ul> <li>On any new environment that configures a backend </li> <li>On any change of the backend configuration (including type of backend) </li> <li>On removing backend configuration completely </li> </ul> <p>You don't need to remember these exact cases. Terraform will detect when initialization is required and error in that situation. Terraform doesn't auto-initialize because it may require additional information from the user, perform state migrations, etc.</p> <p>The <code>init</code> command will do more than just initialize the backend. Please see the <a href="../commands/init.html">init documentation</a> for more information.</p><div class="_attribution">
