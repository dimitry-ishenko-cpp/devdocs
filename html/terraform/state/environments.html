<h1 id="state-environments">  State Environments </h1> <p>The term <em>state environment</em>, or just <em>environment</em>, was used within the Terraform 0.9 releases to refer to the idea of having multiple distinct, named states associated with a single configuration directory.</p> <p>After this concept was implemented, we recieved feedback that this terminology caused confusion due to other uses of the word "environment", both within Terraform itself and within organizations using Terraform.</p> <p>As of 0.10, the preferred term is "workspace". For more information on workspaces, see <a href="workspaces.html">the main Workspaces page</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
