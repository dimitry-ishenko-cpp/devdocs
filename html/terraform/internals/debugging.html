<h1 id="debugging-terraform">  Debugging Terraform </h1> <p>Terraform has detailed logs which can be enabled by setting the <code>TF_LOG</code> environment variable to any value. This will cause detailed logs to appear on stderr.</p> <p>You can set <code>TF_LOG</code> to one of the log levels <code>TRACE</code>, <code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>WARN</code> or <code>ERROR</code> to change the verbosity of the logs. <code>TRACE</code> is the most verbose and it is the default if <code>TF_LOG</code> is set to something other than a log level name.</p> <p>To persist logged output you can set <code>TF_LOG_PATH</code> in order to force the log to always be appended to a specific file when logging is enabled. Note that even when <code>TF_LOG_PATH</code> is set, <code>TF_LOG</code> must be set in order for any logging to be enabled.</p> <p>If you find a bug with Terraform, please include the detailed log by using a service such as gist.</p> <h2 id="interpreting-a-crash-log">  Interpreting a Crash Log </h2> <p>If Terraform ever crashes (a "panic" in the Go runtime), it saves a log file with the debug logs from the session as well as the panic message and backtrace to <code>crash.log</code>. Generally speaking, this log file is meant to be passed along to the developers via a GitHub Issue. As a user, you're not required to dig into this file.</p> <p>However, if you are interested in figuring out what might have gone wrong before filing an issue, here are the basic details of how to read a crash log.</p> <p>The most interesting part of a crash log is the panic message itself and the backtrace immediately following. So the first thing to do is to search the file for <code>panic:</code>, which should jump you right to this message. It will look something like this:</p> <pre>panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

<p>The key part of this message is the first two lines that involve <code>hashicorp/terraform</code>. In this example:</p> <pre>github.com/hashicorp/terraform/builtin/providers/aws.resourceAwsSomeResourceCreate(...)
    /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform/builtin/providers/aws/resource_aws_some_resource.go:123 +0x123
</pre>
<p>The first line tells us that the method that failed is <code>resourceAwsSomeResourceCreate</code>, which we can deduce that involves the creation of a (fictional) <code>aws_some_resource</code>.</p> <p>The second line points to the exact line of code that caused the panic, which--combined with the panic message itself--is normally enough for a developer to quickly figure out the cause of the issue.</p> <p>As a user, this information can help work around the problem in a pinch, since it should hopefully point to the area of the code base in which the crash is happening.</p><div class="_attribution">
