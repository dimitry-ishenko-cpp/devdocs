<h1 id="plugin-basics">  Plugin Basics </h1> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>Advanced topic!</strong> Plugin development is a highly advanced topic in Terraform, and is not required knowledge for day-to-day usage. If you don't plan on writing any plugins, this section of the documentation is not necessary to read. For general use of Terraform, please see our <a href="https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html">Intro to Terraform</a> and <a href="https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html">Getting Started</a> guides.</p> </blockquote> <p>This page documents the basics of how the plugin system in Terraform works, and how to setup a basic development environment for plugin development if you're writing a Terraform plugin.</p> <h2 id="how-it-works">  How it Works </h2> <p>Terraform providers and provisioners are provided via plugins. Each plugin exposes an implementation for a specific service, such as AWS, or provisioner, such as bash. Plugins are executed as a separate process and communicate with the main Terraform binary over an RPC interface.</p> <p>More details are available in <em><a href="../internals/internal-plugins.html">Plugin Internals</a></em>.</p> <p>The code within the binaries must adhere to certain interfaces. The network communication and RPC is handled automatically by higher-level Terraform libraries. The exact interface to implement is documented in its respective documentation section.</p> <h2 id="installing-a-plugin">  Installing a Plugin </h2> <p>To install a plugin distributed by a third party developer, place the binary (extracted from any containing zip file) in <a href="../configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins">the third-party plugins directory</a>.</p> <p>Provider plugin binaries are named with the prefix <code>terraform-provider-</code>, while provisioner plugins have the prefix <code>terraform-provisioner-</code>. Both are placed in the same directory.</p> <h2 id="developing-a-plugin">  Developing a Plugin </h2> <p>Developing a plugin is simple. The only knowledge necessary to write a plugin is basic command-line skills and basic knowledge of the <a href="http://golang.org">Go programming language</a>.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> A common pitfall is not properly setting up a <code>$GOPATH</code>. This can lead to strange errors. You can read more about this <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html">here</a> to familiarize yourself.</p> </blockquote> <p>Create a new Go project somewhere in your <code>$GOPATH</code>. If you're a GitHub user, we recommend creating the project in the directory <code>$GOPATH/src/github.com/USERNAME/terraform-NAME</code>, where <code>USERNAME</code> is your GitHub username and <code>NAME</code> is the name of the plugin you're developing. This structure is what Go expects and simplifies things down the road.</p> <p>The <code>NAME</code> should either begin with <code>provider-</code> or <code>provisioner-</code>, depending on what kind of plugin it will be. The repository name will, by default, be the name of the binary produced by <code>go install</code> for your plugin package.</p> <p>With the package directory made, create a <code>main.go</code> file. This project will be a binary so the package is "main":</p> <pre>package main

import (
    "github.com/hashicorp/terraform/plugin"
)

func main() {
    plugin.Serve(new(MyPlugin))
}
</pre>
<p>The name <code>MyPlugin</code> is a placeholder for the struct type that represents your plugin's implementation. This must implement either <code>terraform.ResourceProvider</code> or <code>terraform.ResourceProvisioner</code>, depending on the plugin type.</p> <p>To test your plugin, the easiest method is to copy your <code>terraform</code> binary to <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> and ensure that this copy is the one being used for testing. <code>terraform init</code> will search for plugins within the same directory as the <code>terraform</code> binary, and <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> is the directory into which <code>go install</code> will place the plugin executable.</p><div class="_attribution">
