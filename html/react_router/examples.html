React Router Examples</h1>
<p>Welcome to the examples for React Router.</p>
<p>Here you'll find various examples of using React Router to accomplish certain tasks. Each example is a complete application including a build and even a button to preview a live instance of the app so you can play with it. You'll most often be interested in checking out the code in <code>src/App.tsx</code> (or <code>src/App.js</code>), but we included the entire source code for the app for completeness.</p>
<p>Also, remember to check out the README!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p><div class="_attribution">
