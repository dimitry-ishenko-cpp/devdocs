<h1>tdbc_sqlite3</h1>  <h2 id="M2">Name</h2> tdbc::sqlite3 â€” TDBC driver for the SQLite3 database manager <h2 id="M3">Synopsis</h2> package require <b>tdbc::sqlite3 1.0</b><br> <b>tdbc::sqlite3::connection create</b> <i>db</i> <i>fileName</i> ?<i>-option value...</i>?<br> <h2 id="M4">Description</h2> The <b>tdbc::sqlite3</b> driver provides a database interface that conforms to Tcl DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and allows a Tcl script to connect to a SQLite3 database. It is also provided as a worked example of how to write a database driver in Tcl, so that driver authors have a starting point for further development. <p> Connection to a SQLite3 database is established by invoking <b>tdbc::sqlite3::connection create</b>, passing it a string to be used as the connection handle followed by the file name of the database. The side effect of <b>tdbc::sqlite3::connection create</b> is to create a new database connection.. As an alternative, <b>tdbc::sqlite::connection new</b> may be used to create a database connection with an automatically assigned name. The return value from <b>tdbc::sqlite::connection new</b> is the name that was chosen for the connection handle. See <b>tdbc::connection(n)</b> for the details of how to use the connection to manipulate a database. </p>
<h2 id="M5">Configuration options</h2> The standard configuration options <b>-encoding</b>, <b>-isolation</b>, <b>-readonly</b> and <b>-timeout</b> are all recognized, both on <b>tdbc::sqlite3::connection create</b> and on the <b>configure</b> method of the resulting connection. <p> Since the encoding of a SQLite3 database is always well known, the <b>-encoding</b> option accepts only <b>utf-8</b> as an encoding and always returns <b>utf-8</b> for an encoding. The actual encoding may be set using a SQLite3 <b>PRAGMA</b> statement when creating a new database. </p>
<p> Only the isolation levels <b>readuncommitted</b> and <b>serializable</b> are implemented. Other isolation levels are promoted to <b>serializable</b>. </p>
<p> The <b>-readonly</b> flag is not implemented. <b>-readonly 0</b> is accepted silently, while <b>-readonly 1</b> reports an error. </p>
<h2 id="M6">Bugs</h2> If any column name is not unique among the columns in a result set, the results of <b>-as dicts</b> returns will be missing all but the rightmost of the duplicated columns. This limitation can be worked around by adding appropriate <b>AS</b> clauses to <b>SELECT</b> statements to ensure that all returned column names are unique. Plans are to fix this bug by using a C implementation of the driver, which will also improve performance significantly. <h2 id="M7">See also</h2> <b><a href="../tdbccmd/tdbc.htm.html">tdbc</a></b>, <b><a href="../tdbccmd/tdbc_connection.htm.html">tdbc::connection</a></b>, <b><a href="../tdbccmd/tdbc_resultset.htm.html">tdbc::resultset</a></b>, <b><a href="../tdbccmd/tdbc_statement.htm.html">tdbc::statement</a></b>   <h2 id="M9">Copyright</h2> Copyright (c) 2008 by Kevin B.
