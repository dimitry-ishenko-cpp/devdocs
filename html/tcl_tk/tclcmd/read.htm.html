<h1>read</h1>  <h2 id="M2">Name</h2> read — Read from a channel <h2 id="M3">Synopsis</h2> <b>read </b>?<b>-nonewline</b>? <i>channelId</i><br> <b>read </b><i>channelId numChars</i><br> <h2 id="M4">Description</h2> In the first form, the <b>read</b> command reads all of the data from <i>channelId</i> up to the end of the file. If the <b>-nonewline</b> switch is specified then the last character of the file is discarded if it is a newline. In the second form, the extra argument specifies how many characters to read. Exactly that many characters will be read and returned, unless there are fewer than <i>numChars</i> left in the file; in this case all the remaining characters are returned. If the channel is configured to use a multi-byte encoding, then the number of characters read may not be the same as the number of bytes read. <p> <i>ChannelId</i> must be an identifier for an open channel such as the Tcl standard input channel (<b><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclLib/GetStdChan.htm">stdin</a></b>), the return value from an invocation of <b><a href="open.htm.html">open</a></b> or <b><a href="socket.htm.html">socket</a></b>, or the result of a channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension. The channel must have been opened for input. </p>
<p> If <i>channelId</i> is in nonblocking mode, the command may not read as many characters as requested: once all available input has been read, the command will return the data that is available rather than blocking for more input. If the channel is configured to use a multi-byte encoding, then there may actually be some bytes remaining in the internal buffers that do not form a complete character. These bytes will not be returned until a complete character is available or end-of-file is reached. The <b>-nonewline</b> switch is ignored if the command returns before reaching the end of the file. </p>
<p> <b>Read</b> translates end-of-line sequences in the input into newline characters according to the <b>-translation</b> option for the channel. See the <b><a href="fconfigure.htm.html">fconfigure</a></b> manual entry for a discussion on ways in which <b><a href="fconfigure.htm.html">fconfigure</a></b> will alter input. </p>
<h2 id="M5">Use with serial ports</h2> For most applications a channel connected to a serial port should be configured to be nonblocking: <b><a href="fconfigure.htm.html">fconfigure</a></b><i> channelId </i><b>-blocking </b><i>0</i>. Then <b>read</b> behaves much like described above. Care must be taken when using <b>read</b> on blocking serial ports: 
<dl class="use with serial ports"> <dt id="M6">
<b>read </b><i>channelId numChars</i>
</dt>
<dd> In this form <b>read</b> blocks until <i>numChars</i> have been received from the serial port. 
</dd>
<dt id="M7">
<b>read </b><i>channelId</i>
</dt>
<dd> In this form <b>read</b> blocks until the reception of the end-of-file character, see <b><a href="fconfigure.htm.html">fconfigure</a></b> <b>-eofchar</b>. If there no end-of-file character has been configured for the channel, then <b>read</b> will block forever. 
</dd>
</dl> <h2 id="M8">Example</h2> This example code reads a file all at once, and splits it into a list, with each line in the file corresponding to an element in the list: 
<pre>set fl [open /proc/meminfo]
set data [<b>read</b> $fl]
close $fl
set lines [split $data \n]</pre> <h2 id="M9">See also</h2> <b><a href="file.htm.html">file</a></b>, <b><a href="eof.htm.html">eof</a></b>, <b><a href="fblocked.htm.html">fblocked</a></b>, <b><a href="fconfigure.htm.html">fconfigure</a></b>, <b><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclLib/StdChannels.htm">Tcl_StandardChannels</a></b>   <div class="_attribution"><p class="_attribution-p">Copyright © 1993 The Regents of the University of California.<br> Copyright © 1994-1996 Sun Microsystems, Inc. </p></div><div class="_attribution">
