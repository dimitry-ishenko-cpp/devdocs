<h1>platform</h1>  <h2 id="M2">Name</h2> platform — System identification support code and utilities <h2 id="M3">Synopsis</h2> <b>package require platform ?1.0.10?</b><br> <b>platform::generic</b><br> <b>platform::identify</b><br> <b>platform::patterns </b><i>identifier</i><br> <h2 id="M4">Description</h2> The <b>platform</b> package provides several utility commands useful for the identification of the architecture of a machine running Tcl. <p> Whilst Tcl provides the <b><a href="tclvars.htm.html">tcl_platform</a></b> array for identifying the current architecture (in particular, the platform and machine elements) this is not always sufficient. This is because (on Unix machines) <b><a href="tclvars.htm.html">tcl_platform</a></b> reflects the values returned by the <b>uname</b> command and these are not standardized across platforms and architectures. In addition, on at least one platform (AIX) the <b>tcl_platform(machine)</b> contains the CPU serial number. </p>
<p> Consequently, individual applications need to manipulate the values in <b><a href="tclvars.htm.html">tcl_platform</a></b> (along with the output of system specific utilities) - which is both inconvenient for developers, and introduces the potential for inconsistencies in identifying architectures and in naming conventions. </p>
<p> The <b>platform</b> package prevents such fragmentation - i.e., it establishes a standard naming convention for architectures running Tcl and makes it more convenient for developers to identify the current architecture a Tcl program is running on. </p>
<h2 id="M5">Commands</h2> <dl class="commands"> <dt id="M6"><b>platform::identify</b></dt>
<dd> This command returns an identifier describing the platform the Tcl core is running on. The returned identifier has the general format <i>OS</i>-<i>CPU</i>. The <i>OS</i> part of the identifier may contain details like kernel version, libc version, etc., and this information may contain dashes as well. The <i>CPU</i> part will not contain dashes, making the preceding dash the last dash in the result. 
</dd>
<dt id="M7"><b>platform::generic</b></dt>
<dd> This command returns a simplified identifier describing the platform the Tcl core is running on. In contrast to <b>platform::identify</b> it leaves out details like kernel version, libc version, etc. The returned identifier has the general format <i>OS</i>-<i>CPU</i>. 
</dd>
<dt id="M8">
<b>platform::patterns </b><i>identifier</i>
</dt>
<dd> This command takes an identifier as returned by <b>platform::identify</b> and returns a list of identifiers describing compatible architectures. 
</dd>
</dl> <h2 id="M9">Example</h2> This can be used to allow an application to be shipped with multiple builds of a shared library, so that the same package works on many versions of an operating system. For example: 
<pre><b>package require platform</b>
# Assume that app script is .../theapp/bin/theapp.tcl
set binDir [file dirname [file normalize [info script]]]
set libDir [file join $binDir .. lib]
set platLibDir [file join $libDir [<b>platform::identify</b>]]
load [file join $platLibDir support[info sharedlibextension]]</pre>   <div class="_attribution"><p class="_attribution-p">Copyright © 2006 ActiveState Software Inc </p></div><div class="_attribution">
