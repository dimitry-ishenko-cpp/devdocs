<h1>body</h1>  <h2 id="M2">Name</h2> itcl::body — change the body for a class method/proc <h2 id="M3">Synopsis</h2> <b>itcl::body </b><i>className</i><b>::</b><i>function args body</i><br> <h2 id="M4">Description</h2> The <b>body</b> command is used outside of an <b>[incr Tcl]</b> class definition to define or redefine the body of a class method or proc. This facility allows a class definition to have separate "interface" and "implementation" parts. The "interface" part is a <b>class</b> command with declarations for methods, procs, instance variables and common variables. The "implementation" part is a series of <b>body</b> and <b>configbody</b> commands. If the "implementation" part is kept in a separate file, it can be sourced again and again as bugs are fixed, to support interactive development. When using the "tcl" mode in the <b>emacs</b> editor, the "interface" and "implementation" parts can be kept in the same file; as bugs are fixed, individual bodies can be highlighted and sent to the test application. <p> The name "<i>className</i><b>::</b><i>function</i>" identifies the method/proc being changed. </p>
<p> If an <i>args</i> list was specified when the <i>function</i> was defined in the class definition, the <i>args</i> list for the <b>body</b> command must match in meaning. Variable names can change, but the argument lists must have the same required arguments and the same default values for optional arguments. The special <b>args</b> argument acts as a wildcard when included in the <i>args</i> list in the class definition; it will match zero or more arguments of any type when the body is redefined. </p>
<p> If the <i>body</i> string starts with "<b>@</b>", it is treated as the symbolic name for a C procedure. The <i>args</i> list has little meaning for the C procedure, except to document the expected usage. (The C procedure is not guaranteed to use arguments in this manner.) If <i>body</i> does not start with "<b>@</b>", it is treated as a Tcl command script. When the function is invoked, command line arguments are matched against the <i>args</i> list, and local variables are created to represent each argument. This is the usual behavior for a Tcl-style proc. </p>
<p> Symbolic names for C procedures are established by registering procedures via <b><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/ItclLib/RegisterC.htm">Itcl_RegisterC()</a></b>. This is usually done in the <b><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclLib/AppInit.htm">Tcl_AppInit()</a></b> procedure, which is automatically called when the interpreter starts up. In the following example, the procedure <tt>My_FooCmd()</tt> is registered with the symbolic name "foo". This procedure can be referenced in the <b>body</b> command as "<tt>@foo</tt>". </p>
<pre>int
<a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclLib/AppInit.htm">Tcl_AppInit</a>(interp)
    <a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclLib/Interp.htm">Tcl_Interp</a> *interp;     /* Interpreter for application. */
{
    if (Itcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }

    if (<a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/ItclLib/RegisterC.htm">Itcl_RegisterC</a>(interp, "foo", My_FooCmd) != TCL_OK) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }
}</pre> <h2 id="M5">Example</h2> In the following example, a "File" class is defined to represent open files. The method bodies are included below the class definition via the <b>body</b> command. Note that the bodies of the constructor/destructor must be included in the class definition, but they can be redefined via the <b>body</b> command as well. <pre>itcl::class File {
    private variable fid ""
    constructor {name access} {
        set fid [open $name $access]
    }
    destructor {
        close $fid
    }

    method get {}
    method put {line}
    method eof {}
}

itcl::body File::get {} {
    return [gets $fid]
}
itcl::body File::put {line} {
    puts $fid $line
}
itcl::body File::eof {} {
    return [::eof $fid]
}

#
# See the File class in action:
#
File x /etc/passwd "r"
while {![x eof]} {
    puts "=&gt; [x get]"
}
itcl::delete object x</pre>   <div class="_attribution"><p class="_attribution-p">Copyright © 1993-1998 Lucent Technologies, Inc. </p></div><div class="_attribution">
