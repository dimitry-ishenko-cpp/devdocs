<h1>configbody</h1>  <h2 id="M2">Name</h2> itcl::configbody — change the "config" code for a public variable <h2 id="M3">Synopsis</h2> <b>itcl::configbody </b><i>className</i><b>::</b><i>varName body</i><br> <h2 id="M4">Description</h2> The <b>configbody</b> command is used outside of an <b>[incr Tcl]</b> class definition to define or redefine the configuration code associated with a public variable. Public variables act like configuration options for an object. They can be modified outside the class scope using the built-in <b>configure</b> method. Each variable can have a bit of "config" code associate with it that is automatically executed when the variable is configured. The <b>configbody</b> command can be used to define or redefine this body of code. <p> Like the <b>body</b> command, this facility allows a class definition to have separate "interface" and "implementation" parts. The "interface" part is a <b>class</b> command with declarations for methods, procs, instance variables and common variables. The "implementation" part is a series of <b>body</b> and <b>configbody</b> commands. If the "implementation" part is kept in a separate file, it can be sourced again and again as bugs are fixed, to support interactive development. When using the "tcl" mode in the <b>emacs</b> editor, the "interface" and "implementation" parts can be kept in the same file; as bugs are fixed, individual bodies can be highlighted and sent to the test application. </p>
<p> The name "<i>className</i><b>::</b><i>varName</i>" identifies the public variable being updated. If the <i>body</i> string starts with "<b>@</b>", it is treated as the symbolic name for a C procedure. Otherwise, it is treated as a Tcl command script. </p>
<p> Symbolic names for C procedures are established by registering procedures via <b><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/ItclLib/RegisterC.htm">Itcl_RegisterC()</a></b>. This is usually done in the <b><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclLib/AppInit.htm">Tcl_AppInit()</a></b> procedure, which is automatically called when the interpreter starts up. In the following example, the procedure <tt>My_FooCmd()</tt> is registered with the symbolic name "foo". This procedure can be referenced in the <b>configbody</b> command as "<tt>@foo</tt>". </p>
<pre>int
<a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclLib/AppInit.htm">Tcl_AppInit</a>(interp)
    <a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclLib/Interp.htm">Tcl_Interp</a> *interp;     /* Interpreter for application. */
{
    if (Itcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }

    if (<a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/ItclLib/RegisterC.htm">Itcl_RegisterC</a>(interp, "foo", My_FooCmd) != TCL_OK) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }
}</pre> <h2 id="M5">Example</h2> In the following example, a "File" class is defined to represent open files. Whenever the "-name" option is configured, the existing file is closed, and a new file is opened. Note that the "config" code for a public variable is optional. The "-access" option, for example, does not have it. <pre>itcl::class File {
    private variable fid ""

    public variable name ""
    public variable access "r"

    constructor {args} {
        eval configure $args
    }
    destructor {
        if {$fid != ""} {
            close $fid
        }
    }

    method get {}
    method put {line}
    method eof {}
}

itcl::body File::get {} {
    return [gets $fid]
}
itcl::body File::put {line} {
    puts $fid $line
}
itcl::body File::eof {} {
    return [::eof $fid]
}

itcl::configbody File::name {
    if {$fid != ""} {
        close $fid
    }
    set fid [open $name $access]
}
