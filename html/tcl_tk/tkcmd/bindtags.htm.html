<h1>bindtags</h1>  <h2 id="M2">Name</h2> bindtags — Determine which bindings apply to a window, and order of evaluation <h2 id="M3">Synopsis</h2> <b>bindtags </b><i>window </i>?<i>tagList</i>?<br> <h2 id="M4">Description</h2> When a binding is created with the <b><a href="bind.htm.html">bind</a></b> command, it is associated either with a particular window such as <b>.a.b.c</b>, a class name such as <b><a href="button.htm.html">Button</a></b>, the keyword <b>all</b>, or any other string. All of these forms are called <i>binding tags</i>. Each window contains a list of binding tags that determine how events are processed for the window. When an event occurs in a window, it is applied to each of the window's tags in order: for each tag, the most specific binding that matches the given tag and event is executed. See the <b><a href="bind.htm.html">bind</a></b> command for more information on the matching process. <p> By default, each window has four binding tags consisting of the name of the window, the window's class name, the name of the window's nearest toplevel ancestor, and <b>all</b>, in that order. Toplevel windows have only three tags by default, since the toplevel name is the same as that of the window. The <b>bindtags</b> command allows the binding tags for a window to be read and modified. </p>
<p> If <b>bindtags</b> is invoked with only one argument, then the current set of binding tags for <i>window</i> is returned as a list. If the <i>tagList</i> argument is specified to <b>bindtags</b>, then it must be a proper list; the tags for <i>window</i> are changed to the elements of the list. The elements of <i>tagList</i> may be arbitrary strings; however, any tag starting with a dot is treated as the name of a window; if no window by that name exists at the time an event is processed, then the tag is ignored for that event. The order of the elements in <i>tagList</i> determines the order in which binding scripts are executed in response to events. For example, the command </p>
<pre><b>bindtags .b {all . Button .b}</b></pre> reverses the order in which binding scripts will be evaluated for a button named <b>.b</b> so that <b>all</b> bindings are invoked first, following by bindings for <b>.b</b>'s toplevel (“.”), followed by class bindings, followed by bindings for <b>.b</b>. If <i>tagList</i> is an empty list then the binding tags for <i>window</i> are returned to the default state described above. <p> The <b>bindtags</b> command may be used to introduce arbitrary additional binding tags for a window, or to remove standard tags. For example, the command </p>
<pre><b>bindtags .b {.b TrickyButton . all}</b></pre> replaces the <b><a href="button.htm.html">Button</a></b> tag for <b>.b</b> with <b>TrickyButton</b>. This means that the default widget bindings for buttons, which are associated with the <b><a href="button.htm.html">Button</a></b> tag, will no longer apply to <b>.b</b>, but any bindings associated with <b>TrickyButton</b> (perhaps some new button behavior) will apply. <h2 id="M5">Example</h2> If you have a set of nested <b><a href="frame.htm.html">frame</a></b> widgets and you want events sent to a <b><a href="button.htm.html">button</a></b> widget to also be delivered to all the widgets up to the current <b><a href="toplevel.htm.html">toplevel</a></b> (in contrast to Tk's default behavior, where events are not delivered to those intermediate windows) to make it easier to have accelerators that are only active for part of a window, you could use a helper procedure like this to help set things up: <pre>proc setupBindtagsForTreeDelivery {widget} {
    set tags [list $widget [winfo class $widget]]
    set w $widget
    set t [winfo toplevel $w]
    while {$w ne $t} {
        set w [winfo parent $w]
        lappend tags $w
    }
    lappend tags all
    <b>bindtags</b> $widget $tags
}</pre> <h2 id="M6">See also</h2> <b><a href="bind.htm.html">bind</a></b>   <div class="_attribution"><p class="_attribution-p">Copyright © 1990 The Regents of the University of California.<br> Copyright © 1994-1996 Sun Microsystems, Inc. </p></div><div class="_attribution">
