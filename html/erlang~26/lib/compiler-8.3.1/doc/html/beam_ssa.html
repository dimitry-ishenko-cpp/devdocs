  % Normal execution continues</pre> <p> The following invariants must hold for the SSA: </p> <ul> <li> All code that can cause an exception in one of the protected blocks must have explicit control flow edges to the landing pad block. If there are no edges to the landing pad block except from the block containing the <code>new_try_tag</code>, the compiler will remove the redundant exception handler. </li> <li> The extraction of the class, reason and stack trace from the result of the <code>landingpad</code> instruction must be done in that order. Omitting the extraction of elements which are unused is allowed. </li> <li> Both the landing pad block and the final protected block must end with a <code>kill_try_tag</code> instruction. Trying to share the <code>kill_try_tag</code> epilogue between the last protected block and the landing pad is unlikely to work. </li> </ul> <p> The translation of an old-style <code>catch</code> expression into BEAM SSA has the following structure: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">@tag = new_try_tag `try`

Re-issuing an exception is done with the <code>resume</code> instruction. The <code>resume</code> must come after the <code>kill_try_tag</code> instruction in the program flow. For example, if the <code><a href="#Exception-Handling">example in the Exception Handling Section</a></code> was to only handle user <code>throws</code>, the relevant blocks would look like this: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">landing_pad_block:
  @aggregate = landingpad `try`, @tag

In order to generate fresh unused variable names, all compiler transforms maintain a counter, the <code>cnt</code>-field in the <code>opt_st</code>-record, which is incremented each time a new variable or label is created. In the following description the value of the <code>cnt</code>-field is called <code>Cnt</code>. </p> <p> Due to peculiarities in the BEAM SSA code generator, a compiler transformation unfortunately cannot just use the <code>cnt</code>-value directly as a fresh name. There are three basic strategies for creating fresh variable names which can by used by a compiler pass: </p> <p> 1) A name can be derived from an existing name of the form <code>V :: atom() | non_neg_integer()</code> by selecting an atom, which is unique to the compiler pass, to form a new name <code>{A, V}</code>. The same <code>A</code> cannot be used by strategy 3) below. </p> <p> 2) A name can be derived from an existing name of the form <code>V :: non_neg_integer()</code> by combining it with the <code>cnt</code>-field into <code>{V, Cnt}</code>. </p> <p> 3) A fresh name can be created by selecting an atom <code>A</code>, which is unique to the compiler pass, to form the new name <code>{A, Cnt}</code>. The same <code>A</code> cannot be used by strategy 1) above. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
