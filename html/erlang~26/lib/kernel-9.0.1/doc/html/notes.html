For example using <code>msg</code> in a conditional branch would not be formatted as it should before this fix.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18225 Aux Id: PR-6036 </p> </li> <li> <p> Fix the logger_std_h handler to log to standard_error if logging to standard_io fails for any reason.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18226 Aux Id: PR-6253 </p> </li> <li> <p> Fix the TLS distribution to work when starting Erlang in embedded mode and a connection is done before kernel is fully started.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18248 Aux Id: PR-6227 GH-6085 </p> </li> <li> <p> erl <code>-remsh</code> has been improved to provide better error reasons and work when using a shell without terminal support (that is an "oldshell").</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18271 Aux Id: PR-6279 </p> </li> <li> <p> Fix logging of log events generated before kernel is started to not fail if the code for formatting those log messaged have not yet been loaded.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18286 Aux Id: PR-5955 </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>proc_lib:start*/*</code> has become synchronous when the started process fails. This requires that a failing process use a new function <code>proc_lib:init_fail/2,3</code>, or exits, to indicate failure. All OTP behaviours have been fixed to do this. </p> <p> All these start functions now consume the <code>'EXIT'</code> message from a process link for all error returns. Previously it was only the <code>start_link/*</code> functions that did this, and only when the started function exited, not when it used <code>init_ack/1,2</code> or <code>init_fail/2,3</code> to create the return value. </p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18471 Aux Id: GH-6339, PR-6843 </p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed a bug where <code>file:read(standard_io, ...)</code> unexpectedly returned <code>eof</code> in binary mode.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18486 Aux Id: PR-6881 </p> </li> <li> <p> Return type for <code>seq_trace:get_token/1</code> fixed.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18528 Aux Id: PR-7009 </p> </li> <li> <p> Looking up, connecting to and sending to a host with an empty name is now handled by trying to look up the address of the root domain, which fails. Previously some of these operations caused an internal exception, which contradicted type specifications.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18543 Aux Id: GH-6353 </p> </li> <li> <p> Replaced a regex with a special case handling of ANSI Select Graphic Rendition escape characters, to speed up io output that make use of these escape sequences.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18547 Aux Id: PR-7092 </p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="improvements-and-new-features" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Improvements and New Features</div>  </h3> <ul> <li> <p>The Erlang shell has been improved to support the following features:</p> <ul> <li>Auto-complete variables, record names, record field names, map keys, function parameter types and filenames.</li> <li>Open external editor in the shell (with C-o) to edit the current expression in an editor.</li> <li>Support defining records (with types), functions and function typespecs, and custom types in the shell.</li> <li>Do not save pager commands, and input to io:getline in history.</li> </ul> <p> Own Id: OTP-14835 Aux Id: PR-5924 </p> </li> <li> <p>The TTY/terminal subsystem has been rewritten by moving more code to Erlang from the old linked-in driver and implementing all the I/O primitives needed in a NIF instead. </p> <p> On Unix platforms the user should not notice a lot of difference, besides better handling of unicode characters and fixing of some long standing bugs. </p> <p> Windows users will notice that erl.exe has the same functionality as a normal Unix shell and that werl.exe has been removed and replaced with a symlink to erl.exe. This makes the Windows Erlang terminal experience identical to that of Unix. </p> <p> The re-write brings with it a number of bug fixes and feature additions:</p> <ul> <li>The TTY is now reset when Erlang exits, fixing zsh to not break when terminating an Erlang session.</li> <li> <code>standard_error</code> now uses the same unicode mode as <code>standard_io</code>.</li> <li>Hitting backspace when searching the shell history with an empty search string no longer breaks the shell.</li> <li>Tab expansion now works on remote nodes started using the JCL interface.</li> <li>It is now possible to configure the shell slogan and the session slogans (that is the texts that appear when you start an Erlang shell). See the kernel documentation for more details.</li> <li>Added shell:start_interactive for starting the interactive shell from a non-interactive Erlang session (for example an escript).</li> <li>On Windows, when starting in detached mode the standard handler are now set to <code>nul</code> devices instead of being unset.</li> <li> Standard I/O now always defaults to <code>unicode</code> mode if supported. Previously the default was <code>latin1</code> if the runtime system had been started with <code>-oldshell</code> or <code>-noshell</code> (for example in an <code>escript</code>). To send raw bytes over standard out, one now explicitly has to specify <code>io:setopts(standard_io, [{encoding, latin1}]).</code> </li> </ul> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-17932 Aux Id: PR-6144 GH-3150 GH-3390 GH-4343 GH-4225 </p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for socket on Windows.</p> <ul> <li>Pre release status.</li> <li>Error codes not finalized.</li> <li>No explicit support for Windows specific options (socket options, flags for read and write).</li> <li>New async api for Windows (completion). See the <code>Asynchronous calls</code> chapter in the (Socket Usage) Users Guide.</li> <li>To ensure platform independence, gen_tcp and gen_udp is <strong>intended</strong> to be used (not yet updated).</li> </ul> <p> Own Id: OTP-18029</p> </li> <li> <p>As announced since the release of OTP 24, support for:</p> <ul> <li><p> version 4 node container types in the external term format are now mandatory. That is, references supporting up to 5 32-bit integer identifiers, and process and port identifiers with support for 64-bit data storage. The distribution flag <code>DFLAG_V4_NC</code> is therefor now also mandatory. OTP has since OTP 24 supported this. Also note that the external format produced by <code>term_to_binary()</code> and <code>term_to_iovec()</code> will unconditionally produce pids, ports, and references supporting this larger format. </p></li> <li><p> the <code>new link protocol</code> introduced in OTP 23.3 is now mandatory. The distribution flag <code>DFLAG_UNLINK_ID</code> is therefor now also mandatory. </p></li> </ul> <p>Due to the above, OTP 26 nodes will refuse to connect to OTP nodes from releases prior to OTP 24.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18140 Aux Id: PR-6072 </p> </li> <li> <p> Support for Kernel TLS (kTLS), has been added to the SSL application, for TLS distribution (<code>-proto_dist inet_tls</code>), the SSL option <code>{ktls, true}</code>. Using this for general SSL sockets is uncomfortable, undocumented and not recommended since it requires very platform dependent raw options. </p> <p> This, for now, only works for some not too old Linux distributions. Roughly, a kernel 5.2.0 or later with support for UserLand Protocols and the kernel module <code>tls</code> is required. </p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18235 Aux Id: PR-6104, PR-5840 </p> </li> <li> <p> Add code:get_doc/2 which adds support to fetch documentation skeletons of functions using debug_info chunks instead of eep48 doc chunks.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18261 Aux Id: PR-5924 </p> </li> <li> <p> The Erlang shell's auto-completion when typing <code>tab</code> has been changed to happen after the editing current line instead of before it.</p> <p> This behaviour can be configured using a the <code>shell_expand_location</code> STDLIB configuration parameter.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18278 Aux Id: PR-6260 </p> </li> <li> <p> Typing <code>Ctrl+L</code> in a shell now clears the screen and redraws the current line instead of only redrawing the current line. To only redraw the current line, you must now type <code>Alt+L</code>. This brings the behaviour of <code>Ctrl+L</code> closer to how bash and other shells work.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18285 Aux Id: PR-6262 </p> </li> <li> <p> gen_server optimized by caching callback functions</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18305 Aux Id: PR-5831 </p> </li> <li> <p> Prepare the <code>pg</code> communication protocol for upgrade. The plan is for OTP-28 nodes to be able to use an upgraded <code>pg</code> protocol while still being able to talk with OTP 26 nodes.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18327 Aux Id: PR-6433 </p> </li> <li> <p> New <code>disk_log</code> log type <code>rotate</code>, where the log files are compressed upon rotation.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18331 Aux Id: ERIERL-870 </p> </li> <li> <p>The following <code>inet:setopts/2</code> options have been introduced:</p> <dl> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>reuseport</code></strong></dt> <dd><p>Reuse of local port. Load balancing may or may not be provided depending on underlying OS.</p></dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>reuseport_lb</code></strong></dt> <dd><p>Reuse of local port. Load balancing provided.</p></dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>exclusiveaddruse</code></strong></dt> <dd><p>Exclusive address/port usage on Windows. This socket option is Windows specific and will silently be ignored on other systems.</p></dd> </dl> <p>The behavior of setting <code>reuseaddr</code> on Windows have changed in a <strong>backwards incompatible</strong> way. The underlying <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> socket option is now only set if both the <code>reusaddr</code> and the <code>reuseport</code> <code>inet</code> options have been set. This since the underlying <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> socket option on Windows behaves similar to how BSD behaves if both the underlying socket options <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> and <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> have been set. See the documentation of the <code>reuseaddr</code> option for more information.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18344 Aux Id: PR-6522, PR-6944, OTP-18324, PR-6481, GH-6461 </p> </li> <li> <p> Replace size/1 with either tuple_size/1 or byte_size/1</p> <p> The <code>size/1</code> BIF is not optimized by the JIT, and its use can result in worse types for Dialyzer.</p> <p> When one knows that the value being tested must be a tuple, <code>tuple_size/1</code> should always be preferred.</p> <p> When one knows that the value being tested must be a binary, <code>byte_size/1</code> should be preferred. However, <code>byte_size/1</code> also accepts a bitstring (rounding up size to a whole number of bytes), so one must make sure that the call to <code>byte_size/</code> is preceded by a call to <code>is_binary/1</code> to ensure that bitstrings are rejected. Note that the compiler removes redundant calls to <code>is_binary/1</code>, so if one is not sure whether previous code had made sure that the argument is a binary, it does not harm to add an <code>is_binary/1</code> test immediately before the call to <code>byte_size/1</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18405 Aux Id: GH-6672,PR-6702,PR-6768,PR-6700,PR-6769,PR-6812,PR-6814 </p> </li> <li> <p>The function <code>file:pid2name/1</code> is deprecated and will be removed in Erlang/OTP 27.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18419</p> </li> <li> <p> The modules Erlang DNS resolver <code>inet_res</code> and helper modules have been updated for RFC6891; to handle OPT RR with DNSSEC OK (DO) bit.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18442 Aux Id: PR-6786, GH-6606 </p> </li> <li> <p> Introduced <code>application:get_supervisor/1</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18444 Aux Id: PR-6035 </p> </li> <li> <p> Handling of <code>on_load</code> modules during boot has been improved by adding an extra step in the boot order for embedded mode that runs all <code>on_load</code> handlers, instead of relying on explicit invocation of them, later, when the kernel supervision tree starts. </p> <p> This is mostly a code improvement and OTP internal simplification to avoid future bugs and to simplify code maintenance. </p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18447</p> </li> <li> <p> Reduce contention on the code_server by doing the code preparation on the client.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18448 Aux Id: PR-6736 </p> </li> <li> <p> Added a mode to ensure_all_loaded, to start children application and their dependencies concurrently.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18451 Aux Id: PR-6737 </p> </li> <li> <p> Cache OTP boot code paths, to limit how many folders that are being accessed during a module lookup. Can be disabled with -cache_boot_path false. OTP boot code paths consists of ERL_LIB environment variables. The various otp/*/ebin folders. And the {path, ...} clauses in the init script.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18452 Aux Id: PR-6729 </p> </li> <li> <p> Erlang distribution code in Kernel and SSL has been refactored a bit to facilitate debugging and re-usability, which shouldn't have any noticeable effects on behaviour or performance.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18456</p> </li> <li> <p> Add cache attribute to code path apis.</p> <p> Added an optional cache/nocache argument to all code:add_path*, code:set_path*, and code:replace_path* functions. These functions will then avoid doing file-accesses if they are cached. Cache can be cleared with code:clear_cache/0. Added code:del_paths/1 to make it easier to clear multiple paths.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18466 Aux Id: PR-6832 </p> </li> <li> <p> Deprecates <code>dbg:stop_clear/0</code> because it is simply a function alias to <code>dbg:stop/0</code></p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18478 Aux Id: GH-6903 </p> </li> <li> <p> Improvements to code:ensure_modules_loaded/1: Previously it would prepare modules and then abandon references to said modules if they had on_load callbacks. This pull request makes it so they keep the references around and then serially load them without having to fetch the object code and prepare them again.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18484 Aux Id: PR-6844 </p> </li> <li> <p> The internal DNS resolver has been updated to handle DNS LOC RR:s (RFC 1876). This is an undocumented module, although still used by power users. See the source code.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18510 Aux Id: GH-6098, PR-6982 </p> </li> <li> <p> Reduced memory consumption in <code>global</code> when informing other nodes about lost connections.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18521 Aux Id: PR-7025 </p> </li> <li> <p> The <code>net_kernel</code>, <code>global</code>, and <code>global_group</code> servers now have <code><i>fully asynchronous distributed signaling</i></code> enabled all the time which prevents them from ever getting blocked on send of distributed signals.</p> <p> Documentation about blocking distributed signals has also been improved.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18533 Aux Id: PR-7061 </p> </li> <li> <p> Allow IPv6 addresses as host in <code>http</code> packets decoded by <code>erlang:decode_packet/3</code> and <code>gen_tcp</code> packet option. The IPv6 address should be enclosed within <code>[]</code> according to RFC2732.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18540 Aux Id: PR-6900 </p> </li> <li> <p> Remove deprecated functions in OTP-26</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18542</p> </li> <li> <p> Removed <code>code:is_module_native/1</code> since HiPE has been removed. It has since OTP 24 been deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 26. </p> <p> Removed <code>code:rehash/0</code> since the code path feature no longer is present. It has since OTP 19 been deprecated and has since OTP 24 been scheduled for removal in OTP 26.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-18551 Aux Id: PR-7106 </p> </li> <li> <p>Added support for multiple line expressions and navigation in the shell. Added new keybindings:</p> <ul> <li> navigate up (ctrl+up)/(alt+up) </li> <li> navigate down (ctrl+down)/(alt+down) </li> <li> insert newline in middle of line (alt+enter) </li> <li> navigate top (alt+&lt;)/(alt+shift+up) </li> <li> navigate bottom (alt+&gt;)/(alt+shift+down) </li> <li> clear current expression (alt+c) </li> <li> cancel search (alt+c) </li> <li> opening editor on mac (option+o)/(alt+o) </li> </ul> <p>Modifies the prompt for new lines to make it clearer that the prompt has entered multi-line mode. Supports terminal with small window size, recommend not go lower than 7 rows and 40 columns. Modifies the search prompt to support multi-line statements.

This is problematic for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such as for example <code>mnesia</code>, but also for <code>global</code> itself. A network of overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of <code>global</code> to become inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during such a partitioning. </p> <p> In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a <i>prevent overlapping partitions</i> fix which can be enabled using the <code>prevent_overlapping_partitions</code> <code>kernel(6)</code> parameter. When this fix has been enabled, <code>global</code> will actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping partitions. Note that this fix <i>has</i> to be enabled on <i>all</i> nodes in the network in order to work properly.

This is problematic for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such as for example <code>mnesia</code>, but also for <code>global</code> itself. A network of overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of <code>global</code> to become inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during such a partitioning. </p> <p> In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a <i>prevent overlapping partitions</i> fix which can be enabled using the <code>prevent_overlapping_partitions</code> <code>kernel(6)</code> parameter. When this fix has been enabled, <code>global</code> will actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping partitions. Note that this fix <i>has</i> to be enabled on <i>all</i> nodes in the network in order to work properly. Since this quite substantially changes the behavior, this fix is currently disabled by default. Since you might get hard to detect issues without this fix you are, however, <i>strongly</i> advised to enable this fix in order to avoid issues such as the ones described above.

This caused the name to be truncated and in some cases arguments to primitive operations to be mixed up. Filenames containing null characters inside the filename are now <strong>rejected</strong> and will cause primitive file operations to fail. </p> <p> Also environment variable operations used to accept <code>names</code> and <code>values</code> of environment variables containing null characters (integer value zero). This caused operations to silently produce erroneous results. Environment variable names and values containing null characters inside the name or value are now <strong>rejected</strong> and will cause environment variable operations to fail. </p> <p>Primitive environment variable operations also used to accept the <code>$=</code> character in environment variable names causing various problems. <code>$=</code> characters in environment variable names are now also <strong>rejected</strong>. </p> <p>Also <code>os:cmd/1</code> now reject null characters inside its <code>command</code>. </p> <p><code>erlang:open_port/2</code> will also reject null characters inside the port name from now on.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14543 Aux Id: ERL-370 </p> </li> <li> <p><code>os:putenv</code> and <code>os:getenv</code> no longer access the process environment directly and instead work on a thread-safe emulation. The only observable difference is that it's <strong>not</strong> kept in sync with libc <code>getenv(3)</code> / <code>putenv(3)</code>, so those who relied on that behavior in drivers or NIFs will need to add manual synchronization.</p> <p>On Windows this means that you can no longer resolve DLL dependencies by modifying the <code>PATH</code> just before loading the driver/NIF. To make this less of a problem, the emulator now adds the target DLL's folder to the DLL search path.</p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14666</p> </li> <li> <p> Fixed connection tick toward primitive hidden nodes (erl_interface) that could cause faulty tick timeout in rare cases when payload data is sent to hidden node but not received.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14681</p> </li> <li> <p> Make group react immediately on an EXIT-signal from shell in e.g ssh.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-14991 Aux Id: PR1705 </p> </li> <li> <p> Calls to <code>gen_tcp:send/2</code> on closed sockets now returns <code>{error, closed}</code> instead of <code>{error,enotconn}</code>.</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-15001</p> </li> <li> <p> The <code>included_applications</code> key are no longer duplicated as application environment variable.

It is, however, recommended to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.</p> <p>Notice the following potential incompatibilities:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Kernel configuration parameters <code>error_logger</code> still works, but is overruled if the default handler's output destination is configured with Kernel configuration parameter <code>logger</code>.</p> <p>In general, parameters for configuring error logger are overwritten by new parameters for configuring Logger.</p> </li> <li> <p>The concept of SASL error logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the SASL application does not affect which log events are logged.</p> <p>By default, supervisor reports and crash reports are logged by the default Logger handler started by Kernel, and end up at the same destination (terminal or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.</p> <p>Progress reports are not logged by default, but can be enabled by setting the primary log level to info, for example with the Kernel configuration parameter <code>logger_level</code>.</p> <p>To obtain backwards compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter <code>logger_sasl_compatible</code> to <code>true</code>. This prevents the default Logger handler from logging any supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL adds a separate Logger handler during application start, which takes care of these log events. The SASL configuration parameters <code>sasl_error_logger</code> and <code>sasl_errlog_type</code> specify the destination (terminal or file) and severity level to log for these events.</p> </li> </ul> <p> Since Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the right to introduce changes to the Logger API and functionality in patches following this release.

Once the socket's delivered message count either reaches 0 or is explicitly set to 0 with inet:setopts/2 or by including {active,0} as an option when the socket is created, the socket transitions to passive ({active, false}) mode and the socket's controlling process receives a message to inform it of the transition.

New N values are added to the socket's current counter value, and negative numbers can be used to reduce the counter value. Specifying a number that would cause the socket's counter value to go above 32767 causes an einval error. If a negative number is specified such that the counter value would become negative, the socket's counter value is set to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode. If the counter value is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket, [{active,0}]) is specified, the counter value remains at 0 but the appropriate passive mode transition message is generated for the socket.</p> <p> Thanks to Steve Vinoski</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-11368</p> </li> <li> <p> A call to either the <code>garbage_collect/1</code> BIF or the <code>check_process_code/2</code> BIF may trigger garbage collection of another processes than the process calling the BIF. The previous implementations performed these kinds of garbage collections without considering the internal state of the process being garbage collected. In order to be able to more easily and more efficiently implement yielding native code, these types of garbage collections have been rewritten. A garbage collection like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request signal, the actual garbage collection is performed by the process being garbage collected itself, and finalized by a reply signal to the process issuing the request. Using this approach processes can disable garbage collection and yield without having to set up the heap in a state that can be garbage collected.</p> <p> The <code>garbage_collect/2</code>, and <code>check_process_code/3</code> BIFs have been introduced.

See inet_res(3) and Erts User's Guide: Inet configuration. </p> <p> It can formally not be incompatible with respect to earlier versions since there was no earlier official version. However it was used before and some details have changed. </p> <p> Configuration now initializes from /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hosts on all unix platforms regardless of which distribution mode the node is started in. The directory (/etc) these files are supposed to reside in can be changed via an environment variable. These configuration file locations can also be changed in the inet configuration. The files are monitored for change and re-read, which makes a few resolver configuration variables out of application control. The /etc/hosts entries have now their own cache table that is shadowed (with lookup method 'file' is used) by the application configured host entries. This problem (that inet_res configuration only worked for distribution mode long names) was among other reported by Matthew O'Gorman many moons ago. </p> <p> The lookup methods are still 'native' only per default.

This is still unsupported and there are access functions in inet_dns to use instead. These are documented in inet_res(3). </p> <p> Bug fix: a compression reference loop would make DNS message decoding loop forever. Problem reported by Florian Weimer. </p> <p> Bug fix and patch suggestion by Sergei Golovan: configuring IPv6 nameservers did not work. His patch (as he warned) created many UDP sockets; one per nameserver. This has been fixed in the released version. </p> <p> Improvement: <code>inet_res</code> is now EDNS0 capable. The current implementation is simple and does not probe and cache EDNS info for nameservers, which a fully capable implementation probably should do. EDNS has to be enabled via resolver configuration, and if a nameserver replies that it does not support EDNS, <code>inet_res</code> falls back to a regular DNS query. </p> <p> Improvement: now <code>inet_res</code> automatically falls back to TCP if it gets a truncated answer from a nameserver. </p> <p> Warning: some of the ancient and exotic record types handled by <code>inet_res</code> and <code>inet_dns</code> are not supported by current versions of BIND, so they could not be tested after the rewrite, with reasonable effort, e.g MD, MF, NULL, and SPF. The risk for bugs in these particular records is still low since their code is mostly shared with other tested record types. </p> <p> *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p> <p> Own Id: OTP-7955 Aux Id: OTP-7107 OTP-6852 </p> </li> <li> <p> A TCP socket with option <code>{packet,4}</code> could crash the emulator if it received a packet header with a very large size value (&gt;2Gb).

The <code>gen_sctp</code> module is documented.</p> <p>The delivered Open Source patch, before the OTP team rewrites, was written according to <code><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13</a></code> and was claimed to work fine, tested on Linux Fedora Core 5.0 (kernel 2.6.15-2054 or later) and on Solaris 10 and 11. The OTP team rewrites used the same standard document but might have accidentally broken some functionality. If so, it will soon be patched to working state. The tricky parts in C and the general design has essentially not changed. During the rewrites the code was hand tested on SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, and briefly on Solaris 10. Feedbach on code and docs is very much appreciated.</p> <p>The SCTP interface is in beta state.

All new <code>+B</code> options are also supported on Windows (werl) as of now. Furthermore, Ctrl-C on Windows has now been reserved for copying text (what Ctrl-Ins was used for previously). Ctrl-Break should be used for break handling. Lastly, the documentation of the system flags has been updated.</p> <p>Own Id: OTP-5388</p> </li> <li> <p>The possibility to start the Erlang shell in parallel with the rest of the system was reintroduced for backwards compatibility in STDLIB 1.13.1. The flag to be used for this is now called <code>async_shell_start</code> and has been documented. New shells started from the JCL menu are not synchronized with <code>init</code> anymore.
