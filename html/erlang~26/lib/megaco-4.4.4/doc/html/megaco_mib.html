<div class="innertube"> <h1 id="Megaco mib">7 Megaco mib</h1> <h2 id="intro" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">7.1 Intro</div>  </h2> <p>The Megaco mib is as of yet not standardized and our implementation is based on <strong>draft-ietf-megaco-mib-04.txt</strong>. Almost all of the mib cannot easily be implemented by the megaco application. Instead these things should be implemented by a user (of the megaco application). </p> <p>So what part of the mib is implemented? Basically the relevant statistic counters of the <strong>MedGwyGatewayStatsEntry</strong>.</p> <h2 id="statistics-counters" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">7.2 Statistics counters</div>  </h2> <p>The implementation of the statistic counters is lightweight. I.e. the statistic counters are handled separately by different entities of the application. For instance our two transport module(s) (see <code><a href="megaco_tcp.html#stats">megaco_tcp</a></code> and <code><a href="megaco_udp.html#stats">megaco_udp</a></code>) maintain their own counters and the application engine (see <code><a href="megaco.html#stats">megaco</a></code>) maintain its own counters.</p> <p>This also means that if a user implement their own transport service then it has to maintain its own statistics.</p> <h2 id="distribution" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">7.3 Distribution</div>  </h2> <p>Each megaco application maintains its own set of counters. So in a large (distributed) MG/MGC it could be necessary to collect the statistics from several nodes (each) running the megaco application (only one of them with the transport).</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
