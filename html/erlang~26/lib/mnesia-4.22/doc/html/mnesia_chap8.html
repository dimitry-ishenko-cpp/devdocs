It is sometimes an advantage to perform this remote control with an open protocol such as the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The alternatives to this would be the following:</p> <ul> <li>Not being able to control the application remotely </li> <li>Using a proprietary control protocol </li> <li>Using a bridge that maps control messages in a proprietary protocol to a standardized management protocol and conversely </li> </ul> <p>All these approaches have different advantages and disadvantages. Mnesia applications can easily be opened to the SNMP protocol. A direct 1-to-1 mapping can be established between Mnesia tables and SNMP tables. This means that a Mnesia table can be configured to be <strong>both</strong> a Mnesia table and an SNMP table. A number of functions to control this behavior are described in the Reference Manual.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
