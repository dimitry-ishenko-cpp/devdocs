<p>This section was written a long time ago. Most of it is still valid, as it explains important concepts, but this was written for an older driver interface so the examples do not work anymore. The reader is encouraged to read the <code><a href="erl_driver.html">erl_driver</a></code> and <code><a href="driver_entry.html">driver_entry</a></code> documentation also.</p> </div> </div> <h2 id="introduction" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">10.1 Introduction</div>  </h2> <p>This section describes how to build your own driver for Erlang.</p> <p>A driver in Erlang is a library written in C, which is linked to the Erlang emulator and called from Erlang. Drivers can be used when C is more suitable than Erlang, to speed up things, or to provide access to OS resources not directly accessible from Erlang.</p> <p>A driver can be dynamically loaded, as a shared library (known as a DLL on Windows), or statically loaded, linked with the emulator when it is compiled and linked. Only dynamically loaded drivers are described here, statically linked drivers are beyond the scope of this section.</p> <div class="warning"> <div class="label">Warning</div> <div class="content">

<p>When a driver is loaded it is executed in the context of the emulator, shares the same memory and the same thread. This means that all operations in the driver must be non-blocking, and that any crash in the driver brings the whole emulator down. In short, be careful.</p> </div> </div> <h2 id="sample-driver" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">10.2 Sample Driver</div>  </h2> <p>This section describes a simple driver for accessing a postgres database using the libpq C client library. Postgres is used because it is free and open source. For information on postgres, see <code><a href="http://www.postgres.org">www.postgres.org</a></code>.</p> <p>The driver is synchronous, it uses the synchronous calls of the client library. This is only for simplicity, but not good, as it halts the emulator while waiting for the database. This is improved below with an asynchronous sample driver.</p> <p>The code is straightforward: all communication between Erlang and the driver is done with <code>port_control/3</code>, and the driver returns data back using the <code>rbuf</code>.</p> <p>An Erlang driver only exports one function: the driver entry function. This is defined with a macro, <code>DRIVER_INIT</code>, which returns a pointer to a C <code>struct</code> containing the entry points that are called from the emulator. The <code>struct</code> defines the entries that the emulator calls to call the driver, with a <code>NULL</code> pointer for entries that are not defined and used by the driver.</p> <p>The <code>start</code> entry is called when the driver is opened as a port with <code>open_port/2</code>. Here we allocate memory for a user data structure. This user data is passed every time the emulator calls us. First we store the driver handle, as it is needed in later calls. We allocate memory for the connection handle that is used by LibPQ. We also set the port to return allocated driver binaries, by setting flag <code>PORT_CONTROL_FLAG_BINARY</code>, calling <code>set_port_control_flags</code>. (This is because we do not know if our data will fit in the result buffer of <code>control</code>, which has a default size, 64 bytes, set up by the emulator.)</p> <p>An entry <code>init</code> is called when the driver is loaded. However, we do not use this, as it is executed only once, and we want to have the possibility of several instances of the driver.</p> <p>The <code>stop</code> entry is called when the port is closed.</p> <p>The <code>control</code> entry is called from the emulator when the Erlang code calls <code>port_control/3</code>, to do the actual work. We have defined a simple set of commands: <code>connect</code> to log in to the database, <code>disconnect</code> to log out, and <code>select</code> to send a SQL-query and get the result. All results are returned through <code>rbuf</code>. The library <code>ei</code> in <code>erl_interface</code> is used to encode data in binary term format. The result is returned to the emulator as binary terms, so <code>binary_to_term</code> is called in Erlang to convert the result to term form.</p> <p>The code is available in <code>pg_sync.c</code> in the <code>sample</code> directory of <code>erts</code>.</p> <p>The driver entry contains the functions that will be called by the emulator. In this example, only <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>control</code> are provided:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">/* Driver interface declarations */

    end.</pre> <p>The Erlang code is slightly different, as we do not return the result synchronously from <code>port_control</code>, instead we get it from <code>driver_output</code> as data in the message queue. The function <code>return_port_data</code> above receives data from the port. As the data is in binary format, we use <code>binary_to_term/1</code> to convert it to an Erlang term. Notice that the driver is opened in binary mode (<code>open_port/2</code> is called with option <code>[binary]</code>). This means that data sent from the driver to the emulator is sent as binaries. Without option <code>binary</code>, they would have been lists of integers.</p> <h2 id="an-asynchronous-driver-using-driver_async" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">10.6 An Asynchronous Driver Using driver_async</div>  </h2> <p>As a final example we demonstrate the use of <code>driver_async</code>. We also use the driver term interface. The driver is written in C++. This enables us to use an algorithm from STL. We use the <code>next_permutation</code> algorithm to get the next permutation of a list of integers. For large lists (&gt; 100,000 elements), this takes some time, so we perform this as an asynchronous task.</p> <p>The asynchronous API for drivers is complicated. First, the work must be prepared. In the example, this is done in <code>output</code>. We could have used <code>control</code>, but we want some variation in the examples. In our driver, we allocate a structure that contains anything that is needed for the asynchronous task to do the work. This is done in the main emulator thread. Then the asynchronous function is called from a driver thread, separate from the main emulator thread. Notice that the driver functions are not re-entrant, so they are not to be used. Finally, after the function is completed, the driver callback <code>ready_async</code> is called from the main emulator thread, this is where we return the result to Erlang. (We cannot return the result from within the asynchronous function, as we cannot call the driver functions.)</p> <p>The following code is from the sample file <code>next_perm.cc</code>. The driver entry looks like before, but also contains the callback <code>ready_async</code>.</p> <pre data-language="erlang">static ErlDrvEntry next_perm_driver_entry = {
    NULL,                        /* init */

};</pre> <p>The <code>output</code> function allocates the work area of the asynchronous function. As we use C++, we use a struct, and stuff the data in it. We must copy the original data, it is not valid after we have returned from the <code>output</code> function, and the <code>do_perm</code> function is called later, and from another thread. We return no data here, instead it is sent later from the <code>ready_async</code> callback.</p> <p>The <code>async_data</code> is passed to the <code>do_perm</code> function. We do not use a <code>async_free</code> function (the last argument to <code>driver_async</code>), it is only used if the task is cancelled programmatically.</p> <pre data-language="erlang">struct our_async_data {
