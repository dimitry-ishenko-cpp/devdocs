<div class="innertube"> <h1 id="How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps">5 How to Interpret the Erlang Crash Dumps</h1> <p>This section describes the <code>erl_crash.dump</code> file generated upon abnormal exit of the Erlang runtime system.</p> <div class="note"> <div class="label">Note</div> <div class="content">

<p>The Erlang crash dump had a major facelift in Erlang/OTP R9C. The information in this section is therefore not directly applicable for older dumps. However, if you use <code> crashdump_viewer(3)</code> on older dumps, the crash dumps are translated into a format similar to this.</p> </div> </div> <p>The system writes the crash dump in the current directory of the emulator or in the file pointed out by the environment variable (whatever that means on the current operating system) <code>ERL_CRASH_DUMP</code>. For a crash dump to be written, a writable file system must be mounted.</p> <p>Crash dumps are written mainly for one of two reasons: either the built-in function <code>erlang:halt/1</code> is called explicitly with a string argument from running Erlang code, or the runtime system has detected an error that cannot be handled. The most usual reason that the system cannot handle the error is that the cause is external limitations, such as running out of memory. A crash dump caused by an internal error can be caused by the system reaching limits in the emulator itself (like the number of atoms in the system, or too many simultaneous ETS tables). Usually the emulator or the operating system can be reconfigured to avoid the crash, which is why interpreting the crash dump correctly is important.</p> <p>On systems that support OS signals, it is also possible to stop the runtime system and generate a crash dump by sending the <code>SIGUSR1</code> signal.</p> <p>The Erlang crash dump is a readable text file, but it can be difficult to read. Using the Crashdump Viewer tool in the <code>Observer</code> application simplifies the task. This is a wx-widget-based tool for browsing Erlang crash dumps.</p> <h2 id="general-information" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">5.1 General Information</div>  </h2> <p>The first part of the crash dump shows the following:</p> <ul> <li>The creation time for the dump</li> <li>A slogan indicating the reason for the dump</li> <li>The system version of the node from which the dump originates</li> <li>The number of atoms in the atom table</li> <li>The runtime system thread that caused the crash dump</li> </ul> <h3 id="reasons-for-crash-dumps--slogan-" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Reasons for Crash Dumps (Slogan)</div>  </h3> <p>The reason for the dump is shown in the beginning of the file as:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
Slogan: &lt;reason&gt;</pre> <p>If the system is halted by the BIF <code>erlang:halt/1</code>, the slogan is the string parameter passed to the BIF, otherwise it is a description generated by the emulator or the (Erlang) kernel. Normally the message is enough to understand the problem, but some messages are described here. Notice that the suggested reasons for the crash are <strong>only suggestions</strong>. The exact reasons for the errors can vary depending on the local applications and the underlying operating system.</p> <dl> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>&lt;A&gt;: Cannot allocate &lt;N&gt; bytes of memory (of type "&lt;T&gt;")</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>The system has run out of memory. &lt;A&gt; is the allocator that failed to allocate memory, &lt;N&gt; is the number of bytes that &lt;A&gt; tried to allocate, and &lt;T&gt; is the memory block type that the memory was needed for. The most common case is that a process stores huge amounts of data. In this case &lt;T&gt; is most often <code>heap</code>, <code>old_heap</code>, <code>heap_frag</code>, or <code>binary</code>. For more information on allocators, see <code><a href="erts_alloc.html">erts_alloc(3)</a></code>.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>&lt;A&gt;: Cannot reallocate &lt;N&gt; bytes of memory (of type "&lt;T&gt;")</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Same as above except that memory was reallocated instead of allocated when the system ran out of memory.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>Unexpected op code &lt;N&gt;</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Error in compiled code, <code>beam</code> file damaged, or error in the compiler.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>Module &lt;Name&gt; undefined <code>|</code> Function &lt;Name&gt; undefined <code>|</code> No function &lt;Name&gt;:&lt;Name&gt;/1 <code>|</code> No function &lt;Name&gt;:start/2</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>The Kernel/STDLIB applications are damaged or the start script is damaged.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>Driver_select called with too large file descriptor <code>N</code></strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>The number of file descriptors for sockets exceeds 1024 (Unix only). The limit on file descriptors in some Unix flavors can be set to over 1024, but only 1024 sockets/pipes can be used simultaneously by Erlang (because of limitations in the Unix <code>select</code> call). The number of open regular files is not affected by this.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>Received SIGUSR1</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Sending the <code>SIGUSR1</code> signal to an Erlang machine (Unix only) forces a crash dump. This slogan reflects that the Erlang machine crash-dumped because of receiving that signal.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>Kernel pid terminated (&lt;Who&gt;) (&lt;Exit reason&gt;)</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>The kernel supervisor has detected a failure, usually that the <code>application_controller</code> has shut down (<code>Who</code> = <code>application_controller</code>, <code>Why</code> = <code>shutdown</code>). The application controller can have shut down for many reasons, the most usual is that the node name of the distributed Erlang node is already in use. A complete supervisor tree "crash" (that is, the top supervisors have exited) gives about the same result. This message comes from the Erlang code and not from the virtual machine itself. It is always because of some failure in an application, either within OTP or a "user-written" one. Looking at the error log for your application is probably the first step to take.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>Init terminating in do_boot ()</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>The primitive Erlang boot sequence was terminated, most probably because the boot script has errors or cannot be read. This is usually a configuration error; the system can have been started with a faulty <code>-boot</code> parameter or with a boot script from the wrong OTP version.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>Could not start kernel pid (&lt;Who&gt;) ()</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>One of the kernel processes could not start. This is probably because of faulty arguments (like errors in a <code>-config</code> argument) or faulty configuration files. Check that all files are in their correct location and that the configuration files (if any) are not damaged. Usually messages are also written to the controlling terminal and/or the error log explaining what is wrong.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>Other errors than these can occur, as the <code>erlang:halt/1</code> BIF can generate any message. If the message is not generated by the BIF and does not occur in the list above, it can be because of an error in the emulator. There can however be unusual messages, not mentioned here, which are still connected to an application failure. There is much more information available, so a thorough reading of the crash dump can reveal the crash reason. The size of processes, the number of ETS tables, and the Erlang data on each process stack can be useful to find the problem.</p> <h3 id="number-of-atoms" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Number of Atoms</div>  </h3> <p>The number of atoms in the system at the time of the crash is shown as <strong>Atoms: &lt;number&gt;</strong>. Some ten thousands atoms is perfectly normal, but more can indicate that the BIF <code>erlang:list_to_atom/1</code> is used to generate many <strong>different</strong> atoms dynamically, which is never a good idea.</p> <h2 id="scheduler-information" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">5.2 Scheduler Information</div>  </h2> <p>Under the tag <strong>=scheduler</strong> is shown information about the current state and statistics of the schedulers in the runtime system. On operating systems that allow suspension of other threads, the data within this section reflects what the runtime system looks like when a crash occurs.</p> <p>The following fields can exist for a process:</p> <dl> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>=scheduler:id</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Heading.

The entries are described in section <code><a href="#processes">Process Information</a></code>.</p> <p>Notice that this is a snapshot of what the entries are exactly when the crash dump is starting to be generated. Therefore they are most likely different (and more telling) than the entries for the same processes found in the <strong>=proc</strong> section. If there is no currently running process, only the <strong>Current Process</strong> entry is shown.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>Current Process Limited Stack Trace</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>This entry is shown only if there is a current process. It is similar to <code><a href="#proc_data"> <strong>=proc_stack</strong></a></code>, except that only the function frames are shown (that is, the stack variables are omitted). Also, only the top and bottom part of the stack are shown. If the stack is small (&lt; 512 slots), the entire stack is shown. Otherwise the entry <strong>skipping ## slots</strong> is shown, where <code>##</code> is replaced by the number of slots that has been skipped.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>Run Queue</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Shows statistics about how many processes and ports of different priorities are scheduled on this scheduler.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><strong>** crashed **</strong></strong></dt> <dd> <p>This entry is normally not shown.
