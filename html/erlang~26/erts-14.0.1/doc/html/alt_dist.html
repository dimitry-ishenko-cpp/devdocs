    ">6 How to Implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang Distribution </h1> <p>This section describes how to implement an alternative carrier protocol for the Erlang distribution. The distribution is normally carried by TCP/IP. Here is explained a method for replacing TCP/IP with another protocol.</p> <p>The section is a step-by-step explanation of the <code>uds_dist</code> example application (in the Kernel application <code>examples</code> directory). The <code>uds_dist</code> application implements distribution over Unix domain sockets and is written for the Sun Solaris 2 operating environment. The mechanisms are however general and apply to any operating system Erlang runs on. The reason the C code is not made portable, is simply readability.</p> <h2 id="introduction" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">6.1 Introduction</div>  </h2> <p>To implement a new carrier for the Erlang distribution, the main steps are as follows.</p> <div class="note"> <div class="label">Note</div> <div class="content">

<p> As of ERTS version 10.0 support for distribution controller processes has been introduced. That is, the traffic over a distribution channel can be managed by a process instead of only by a port. This makes it possible to implement large parts of the logic in Erlang code, and you perhaps do not even need a new driver for the protocol. One example could be Erlang distribution over UDP using <code>gen_udp</code> (your Erlang code will of course have to take care of retransmissions, etc in this example). That is, depending on what you want to do you perhaps do not need to implement a driver at all and can then skip the driver related sections below. The <code>gen_tcp_dist</code> and <code>erl_uds_dist</code> examples described in the <code><a href="#distribution_module">Distribution Module</a></code> section utilize distribution controller processes and can be worth having a look at if you want to use distribution controller processes. </p>
</div> </div> <h3 id="writing-an-erlang-driver" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Writing an Erlang Driver</div>  </h3> <p>First, the protocol must be available to the Erlang machine, which involves writing an Erlang driver. A port program cannot be used, an Erlang driver is required. Erlang drivers can be:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Statically linked to the emulator, which can be an alternative when using the open source distribution of Erlang, or</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamically loaded into the Erlang machines address space, which is the only alternative if a precompiled version of Erlang is to be used</p> </li> </ul> <p>Writing an Erlang driver is not easy. The driver is written as some callback functions called by the Erlang emulator when data is sent to the driver, or the driver has any data available on a file descriptor. As the driver callback routines execute in the main thread of the Erlang machine, the callback functions can perform no blocking activity whatsoever. The callbacks are only to set up file descriptors for waiting and/or read/write available data. All I/O must be non-blocking. Driver callbacks are however executed in sequence, why a global state can safely be updated within the routines.</p> <h3 id="writing-an-erlang-interface-for-the-driver" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Writing an Erlang Interface for the Driver</div>  </h3> <p>When the driver is implemented, one would preferably write an Erlang interface for the driver to be able to test the functionality of the driver separately. This interface can then be used by the distribution module, which will cover the details of the protocol from the <code>net_kernel</code>.</p> <p>The easiest path is to mimic the <code>inet</code> and <code>inet_tcp</code> interfaces, but not much functionality in those modules needs to be implemented. In the example application, only a few of the usual interfaces are implemented, and they are much simplified.</p> <h3 id="writing-a-distribution-module" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Writing a Distribution Module</div>  </h3> <p>When the protocol is available to Erlang through a driver and an Erlang interface module, a distribution module can be written. The distribution module is a module with well-defined callbacks, much like a <code>gen_server</code> (there is no compiler support for checking the callbacks, though). This module implements:</p> <ul> <li>The details of finding other nodes (that is, talking to <code>epmd</code> or something similar)</li> <li>Creating a listen port (or similar)</li> <li>Connecting to other nodes</li> <li>Performing the handshakes/cookie verification</li> </ul> <p>There is however a utility module, <code>dist_util</code>, which does most of the hard work of handling handshakes, cookies, timers, and ticking. Using <code>dist_util</code> makes implementing a distribution module much easier and that is done in the example application.</p> <h3 id="creating-boot-scripts" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Creating Boot Scripts</div>  </h3> <p>The last step is to create boot scripts to make the protocol implementation available at boot time. The implementation can be debugged by starting the distribution when all the system is running, but in a real system the distribution is to start very early, why a boot script and some command-line parameters are necessary.</p> <p>This step also implies that the Erlang code in the interface and distribution modules is written in such a way that it can be run in the startup phase. In particular, there can be no calls to the <code>application</code> module or to any modules not loaded at boot time. That is, only <code>Kernel</code>, <code>STDLIB</code>, and the application itself can be used.</p> <h2 id="distribution-module" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">6.2 Distribution Module</div>  </h2> <p> The distribution module expose an API that <code>net_kernel</code> call in order to manage connections to other nodes. The module name should have the suffix <code>_dist</code>. </p> <p> The module needs to create some kind of listening entity (process or port) and an acceptor process that accepts incoming connections using the listening entity. For each connection, the module at least needs to create one connection supervisor process, which also is responsible for the handshake when setting up the connection, and a distribution controller (process or port) responsible for transport of data over the connection. The distribution controller and the connection supervisor process should be linked together so both of them are cleaned up when the connection is taken down. </p> <p> Note that there need to be exactly one distribution controller per connection. A process or port can only be distribution controller for one connection. The registration as distribution controller cannot be undone. It will stick until the distribution controller terminates. The distribution controller should not ignore exit signals. It is allowed to trap exits, but it should then voluntarily terminate when an exit signal is received. </p> <p> An example implementation of a distribution module can be found in <code><span>$ERL_TOP/lib/kernel/examples/gen_tcp_dist/src/gen_tcp_dist.erl</span></code>. It implements the distribution over TCP/IP using the <code>gen_tcp</code> API with distribution controllers implemented by processes. This instead of using port distribution controllers as the ordinary TCP/IP distribution uses. </p> <p> Another example implementation of a distribution module can be found in <code><span>$ERL_TOP/lib/kernel/examples/erl_uds_dist/src/erl_uds_dist.erl</span></code>. It implements the distribution over Unix domain sockets using the <code>gen_tcp</code> API with distribution controllers implemented by processes. Compared to the original <code>uds_dist</code> example using a port driver written in C, <code>erl_uds_dist</code> is written entirely in Erlang. </p> <h3 id="exported-callback-functions" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Exported Callback Functions</div>  </h3> <p> The following functions are mandatory: </p> <dl> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code id="listen">listen(Name) -&gt;</code><br> <code>{ok, {Listen, Address, Creation}} | {error, Error}</code><br><code>listen(Name,Host) -&gt;</code><br> <code>{ok, {Listen, Address, Creation}} | {error, Error}</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p> <code>listen/2</code> is called once in order to listen for incoming connection requests.

<p>This section was written a long time ago. Most of it is still valid, but some things have changed since then. Some updates have been made to the documentation of the driver presented here, but more can be done and is planned for the future. The reader is encouraged to read the <code><a href="erl_driver.html">erl_driver</a></code> and <code><a href="driver_entry.html">driver_entry</a></code> documentation also.</p> </div> </div> <p>Although Erlang drivers in general can be beyond the scope of this section, a brief introduction seems to be in place.</p> <h3 id="drivers-in-general" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Drivers in General</div>  </h3> <p>An Erlang driver is a native code module written in C (or assembler), which serves as an interface for some special operating system service. This is a general mechanism that is used throughout the Erlang emulator for all kinds of I/O. An Erlang driver can be dynamically linked (or loaded) to the Erlang emulator at runtime by using the <code>erl_ddll</code> Erlang module. Some of the drivers in OTP are however statically linked to the runtime system, but that is more an optimization than a necessity.</p> <p>The driver data types and the functions available to the driver writer are defined in header file <code>erl_driver.h</code> seated in Erlang's include directory. See the <code>erl_driver</code> documentation for details of which functions are available.</p> <p>When writing a driver to make a communications protocol available to Erlang, one should know just about everything worth knowing about that particular protocol. All operation must be non-blocking and all possible situations are to be accounted for in the driver. A non-stable driver will affect and/or crash the whole Erlang runtime system.</p> <p>The emulator calls the driver in the following situations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>When the driver is loaded. This callback must have a special name and inform the emulator of what callbacks are to be used by returning a pointer to a <code>ErlDrvEntry</code> struct, which is to be properly filled in (see below).</p> </li> <li> <p>When a port to the driver is opened (by a <code>open_port</code> call from Erlang). This routine is to set up internal data structures and return an opaque data entity of the type <code>ErlDrvData</code>, which is a data type large enough to hold a pointer. The pointer returned by this function is the first argument to all other callbacks concerning this particular port. It is usually called the port handle. The emulator only stores the handle and does never try to interpret it, why it can be virtually anything (anything not larger than a pointer that is) and can point to anything if it is a pointer. Usually this pointer refers to a structure holding information about the particular port, as it does in the example.</p> </li> <li> <p>When an Erlang process sends data to the port. The data arrives as a buffer of bytes, the interpretation is not defined, but is up to the implementor. This callback returns nothing to the caller, answers are sent to the caller as messages (using a routine called <code>driver_output</code> available to all drivers). There is also a way to talk in a synchronous way to drivers, described below. There can be an additional callback function for handling data that is fragmented (sent in a deep io-list). That interface gets the data in a form suitable for Unix <code>writev</code> rather than in a single buffer. There is no need for a distribution driver to implement such a callback, so we will not.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a file descriptor is signaled for input. This callback is called when the emulator detects input on a file descriptor that the driver has marked for monitoring by using the interface <code>driver_select</code>. The mechanism of driver select makes it possible to read non-blocking from file descriptors by calling <code>driver_select</code> when reading is needed, and then do the reading in this callback (when reading is possible). The typical scenario is that <code>driver_select</code> is called when an Erlang process orders a read operation, and that this routine sends the answer when data is available on the file descriptor.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a file descriptor is signaled for output. This callback is called in a similar way as the previous, but when writing to a file descriptor is possible. The usual scenario is that Erlang orders writing on a file descriptor and that the driver calls <code>driver_select</code>. When the descriptor is ready for output, this callback is called and the driver can try to send the output. Queuing can be involved in such operations, and there are convenient queue routines available to the driver writer to use.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a port is closed, either by an Erlang process or by the driver calling one of the <code>driver_failure_XXX</code> routines. This routine is to clean up everything connected to one particular port. When other callbacks call a <code>driver_failure_XXX</code> routine, this routine is immediately called. The callback routine issuing the error can make no more use of the data structures for the port, as this routine surely has freed all associated data and closed all file descriptors. If the queue utility available to driver writer is used, this routine is however <strong>not</strong> called until the queue is empty.</p> </li> <li> <p>When an Erlang process calls <code><a href="erlang.html#port_control-3"> erlang:port_control/3</a></code>, which is a synchronous interface to drivers. The control interface is used to set driver options, change states of ports, and so on. This interface is used a lot in the example.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a timer expires. The driver can set timers with the function <code>driver_set_timer</code>. When such timers expire, a specific callback function is called. No timers are used in the example.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the whole driver is unloaded. Every resource allocated by the driver is to be freed.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="the-data-structures-of-the-distribution-driver" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">The Data Structures of the Distribution Driver</div>  </h3> <p>The driver used for Erlang distribution is to implement a reliable, order maintaining, variable length packet-oriented protocol. All error correction, resending and such need to be implemented in the driver or by the underlying communications protocol. If the protocol is stream-oriented (as is the case with both TCP/IP and our streamed Unix domain sockets), some mechanism for packaging is needed. We will use the simple method of having a header of four bytes containing the length of the package in a big-endian 32-bit integer. As Unix domain sockets only can be used between processes on the same machine, we do not need to code the integer in some special endianness, but we will do it anyway because in most situation you need to do it. Unix domain sockets are reliable and order maintaining, so we do not need to implement resends and such in the driver.</p> <p>We start writing the example Unix domain sockets driver by declaring prototypes and filling in a static <code>ErlDrvEntry</code> structure:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">( 1) #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

(53) };</pre> <p>On line 1-10 the OS headers needed for the driver are included. As this driver is written for Solaris, we know that the header <code>uio.h</code> exists. So the preprocessor variable <code>HAVE_UIO_H</code> can be defined before <code>erl_driver.h</code> is included on line 12. The definition of <code>HAVE_UIO_H</code> will make the I/O vectors used in Erlang's driver queues to correspond to the operating systems ditto, which is very convenient.</p> <p>On line 16-23 the different callback functions are declared ("forward declarations").</p> <p>The driver structure is similar for statically linked-in drivers and dynamically loaded. However, some of the fields are to be left empty (that is, initialized to NULL) in the different types of drivers. The first field (the <code>init</code> function pointer) is always left blank in a dynamically loaded driver, see line 26. <code>NULL</code> on line 37 is always to be there, the field is no longer used and is retained for backward compatibility. No timers are used in this driver, why no callback for timers is needed. The <code>outputv</code> field (line 40) can be used to implement an interface similar to Unix <code>writev</code> for output. The Erlang runtime system could previously not use <code>outputv</code> for the distribution, but it can as from ERTS 5.7.2. As this driver was written before ERTS 5.7.2 it does not use the <code>outputv</code> callback. Using the <code>outputv</code> callback is preferred, as it reduces copying of data. (We will however use scatter/gather I/O internally in the driver.)</p> <p>As from ERTS 5.5.3 the driver interface was extended with version control and the possibility to pass capability information. Capability flags are present on line 48. As from ERTS 5.7.4 flag <code><a href="driver_entry.html#driver_flags"> ERL_DRV_FLAG_SOFT_BUSY</a></code> is required for drivers that are to be used by the distribution. The soft busy flag implies that the driver can handle calls to the <code>output</code> and <code>outputv</code> callbacks although it has marked itself as busy. This has always been a requirement on drivers used by the distribution, but no capability information has been available about this previously. For more information. see <code><a href="erl_driver.html#set_busy_port"> erl_driver:set_busy_port()</a></code>).</p> <p>This driver was written before the runtime system had SMP support. The driver will still function in the runtime system with SMP support, but performance will suffer from lock contention on the driver lock used for the driver. This can be alleviated by reviewing and perhaps rewriting the code so that each instance of the driver safely can execute in parallel. When instances safely can execute in parallel, it is safe to enable instance-specific locking on the driver. This is done by passing <code><a href="driver_entry.html#driver_flags"> ERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING</a></code> as a driver flag. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p> <p>Thus, the defined callbacks are as follows:</p> <dl> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>uds_start</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Must initiate data for a port. We do not create any sockets here, only initialize data structures.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>uds_stop</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Called when a port is closed.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>uds_command</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Handles messages from Erlang. The messages can either be plain data to be sent or more subtle instructions to the driver. This function is here mostly for data pumping.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>uds_input</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Called when there is something to read from a socket.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>uds_output</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Called when it is possible to write to a socket.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>uds_finish</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Called when the driver is unloaded. A distribution driver will never be unloaded, but we include this for completeness. To be able to clean up after oneself is always a good thing.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>uds_control</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>The <code><a href="erlang.html#port_control-3"> erlang:port_control/3</a></code> callback, which is used a lot in this implementation.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>The ports implemented by this driver operate in two major modes, named <code>command</code> and <code>data</code>. In <code>command</code> mode, only passive reading and writing (like <code>gen_tcp:recv</code>/<code>gen_tcp:send</code>) can be done. The port is in this mode during the distribution handshake. When the connection is up, the port is switched to <code>data</code> mode and all data is immediately read and passed further to the Erlang emulator. In <code>data</code> mode, no data arriving to <code>uds_command</code> is interpreted, only packaged and sent out on the socket. The <code>uds_control</code> callback does the switching between those two modes.</p> <p>While <code>net_kernel</code> informs different subsystems that the connection is coming up, the port is to accept data to send. However, the port should not receive any data, to avoid that data arrives from another node before every kernel subsystem is prepared to handle it. A third mode, named <code>intermediate</code>, is used for this intermediate stage.</p> <p>An enum is defined for the different types of ports:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">( 1) typedef enum {

The buffer is the data sent from Erlang (a list of bytes) converted to an C array (of bytes).</p> <p>If Erlang sends, for example, the list <code>[$a,$b,$c]</code> to the port, the <code>bufflen</code> variable is <code>3</code> and the <code>buff</code> variable contains <code>{'a','b','c'}</code> (no <code>NULL</code> termination). Usually the first byte is used as an opcode, which is the case in this driver too (at least when the port is in <code>command</code> mode). The opcodes are defined as follows:</p> <dl> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>'L'&lt;socket name&gt;</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Creates and listens on socket with the specified name.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>'A'&lt;listen number as 32-bit big-endian&gt;</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Accepts from the listen socket identified by the specified identification number. The identification number is retrieved with the <code>uds_control</code> routine.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>'C'&lt;socket name&gt;</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Connects to the socket named &lt;socket name&gt;.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>'S'&lt;data&gt;</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Sends the data &lt;data&gt; on the connected/accepted socket (in <code>command</code> mode). The sending is acknowledged when the data has left this process.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>'R'</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Receives one packet of data.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>"One packet of data" in command <code>'R'</code> can be explained as follows. This driver always sends data packaged with a 4 byte header containing a big-endian 32-bit integer that represents the length of the data in the packet. There is no need for different packet sizes or some kind of streamed mode, as this driver is for the distribution only. Why is the header word coded explicitly in big-endian when a UDS socket is local to the host? It is good practice when writing a distribution driver, as distribution in practice usually crosses the host boundaries.</p> <p>On line 4-8 is handled the case where the port is in <code>data</code> mode or <code>intermediate</code> mode and the remaining routine handles the different commands. The routine uses the <code>driver_failure_posix()</code> routine to report errors (see, for example, line 15). Notice that the failure routines make a call to the <code>uds_stop</code> routine, which will remove the internal port data. The handle (and the casted handle <code>ud</code>) is therefore <strong>invalid pointers</strong> after a <code>driver_failure</code> call and we should <strong>return immediately</strong>. The runtime system will send exit signals to all linked processes.</p> <p>The <code>uds_input</code> routine is called when data is available on a file descriptor previously passed to the <code>driver_select</code> routine. This occurs typically when a read command is issued and no data is available. The <code>do_recv</code> routine is as follows:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">( 1) static void do_recv(UdsData *ud)

The <code>ErlIOVec</code> also contains an array of <code>ErlDrvBinary</code> pointers, of the same length as the number of buffers in the I/O vector itself. One can use this to allocate the binaries for the queue "manually" in the driver, but here the binary array is filled with <code>NULL</code> values (line 7). The runtime system then allocates its own buffers when <code>driver_enqv</code> is called (line 37).</p> <p>The routine builds an I/O vector containing the header bytes and the buffer (the opcode has been removed and the buffer length decreased by the output routine). If the queue is empty, we write the data directly to the socket (or at least try to). If any data is left, it is stored in the queue and then we try to send the queue (line 38). An acknowledgement is sent when the message is delivered completely (line 22). The <code>send_out_queue</code> sends acknowledgements if the sending is completed there. If the port is in <code>command</code> mode, the Erlang code serializes the send operations so that only one packet can be waiting for delivery at a time.

It is returned as a big-endian 32-bit integer, which is the file identifier for the listen socket.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>'S'</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Gets statistics, which is the number of bytes received, the number of bytes sent, and the number of bytes pending in the output queue. This data is used when the distribution checks that a connection is alive (ticking). The statistics is returned as three 32-bit big-endian integers.</p> </dd> <dt class="title-link"><strong><code>'T'</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>Sends a tick message, which is a packet of length 0.

We always have read select active on a port in <code>data</code> mode (achieved by calling <code>do_recv</code> on line 45), but we turn off read selection in <code>intermediate</code> and <code>command</code> modes (line 27 and 36).</p> <p>The rest of the driver is more or less UDS-specific and not of general interest.</p> <h2 id="putting-it-all-together" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">6.4 Putting It All Together</div>  </h2> <p>To test the distribution, the <code>net_kernel:start/1</code> function can be used. It is useful, as it starts the distribution on a running system, where tracing/debugging can be performed. The <code>net_kernel:start/1</code> routine takes a list as its single argument. The list first element in the list is to be the node name (without the "@hostname") as an atom. The second (and last) element is to be one of the atoms <code>shortnames</code> or <code>longnames</code>. In the example case, <code>shortnames</code> is preferred.</p> <p>For <code>net_kernel</code> to find out which distribution module to use, command-line argument <code>-proto_dist</code> is used. It is followed by one or more distribution module names, with suffix "_dist" removed, that is, <code>uds_dist</code> as a distribution module is specified as <code>-proto_dist uds</code>.</p> <p>If no <code>epmd</code> (TCP port mapper daemon) is used, also command-line option <code>-no_epmd</code> is to be specified, which makes Erlang skip the <code>epmd</code> startup, both as an OS process and as an Erlang ditto.</p> <p>The path to the directory where the distribution modules reside must be known at boot. This can be achieved either by specifying <code>-pa &lt;path&gt;</code> on the command line or by building a boot script containing the applications used for your distribution protocol. (In the <code>uds_dist</code> protocol, only the <code>uds_dist</code> application needs to be added to the script.)</p> <p>The distribution starts at boot if all the above is specified and an <code>-sname &lt;name&gt;</code> flag is present at the command line.</p> <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p> <pre data-language="erlang">
