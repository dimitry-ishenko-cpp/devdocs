<div class="innertube"> <h1 class="main-title">Erlang/OTP 26.0.1</h1> <p class="main-description"> Welcome to Erlang/OTP, a complete development environment for concurrent programming. </p> <h2>Tutorials and books</h2> <ul> <li class="mobile-only"> The navigation menu can be accessed by clicking the  symbol in the top left corner. </li> <li> The Erlang language is described in the <a href="doc/reference_manual/users_guide.html">Erlang Reference Manual</a>. An Erlang tutorial can be found in <a href="doc/getting_started/users_guide.html"> Getting Started With Erlang</a>. <p> In addition to the documentation here Erlang is described in several books like: </p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-erlang-2nd/9781491973363">"Introducing Erlang"</a> from O'Reilly. </li> <li> <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/erlang">"Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!"</a> from No Starch Press. </li> <li> <a href="https://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596518189">"Erlang Programming"</a> from O'Reilly. </li> <li> <a href="https://www.pragprog.com/book/jaerlang2/programming-erlang">"Programming Erlang"</a> from Pragmatic. </li> <li> <a href="https://www.manning.com/logan">"Erlang and OTP in Action"</a> from Manning. </li> <li> <a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do">"Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP"</a> from O'Reilly. </li> </ul> <p> These books are highly recommended as a start for learning Erlang. </p> <p> More information about learning resources, editors and other tools can be found on our <a href="https://erlang.org/community">official Erlang web site</a>. </p> </li> <li>Erlang/OTP is divided into a number of OTP <span>applications</span>. An application normally contains Erlang <span>modules</span>. Some OTP applications, such as the C interface <em>erl_interface</em>, are written in other languages and have no Erlang modules.  </li> 
<li>When developing with Erlang/OTP you usually test your programs from the interactive shell (see <a href="doc/getting_started/users_guide.html"> Getting Started With Erlang</a>) where you can call individual functions. There is also a number of tools available, such as the graphical <a href="lib/debugger-5.3.1/doc/html/index.html">Debugger</a> and the <a href="lib/observer-2.15/doc/html/index.html">Observer tool</a> for inspection of system information, ets and mnesia tables etc. </li>
<li>For questions and discussions about Erlang we recommend <a href="https://erlangforums.com"> ErlangForums</a>.  </li> <li>There is also the <a href="https://www.erlang.org/faq/faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> which can be of interest.  </li> <li>Additional information and links of interest for Erlang programmers can be found on the Erlang Open Source site <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">https://www.erlang.org</a>. </li> </ul>  </div><div class="_attribution">
