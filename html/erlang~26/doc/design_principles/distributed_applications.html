<div class="innertube"> <h1 id="Distributed Applications">9 Distributed Applications</h1>  <h2 id="introduction" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.1 Introduction</div>  </h2> <p>In a distributed system with several Erlang nodes, it can be necessary to control applications in a distributed manner. If the node, where a certain application is running, goes down, the application is to be restarted at another node.</p> <p>Such an application is called a <strong>distributed application</strong>. Notice that it is the control of the application that is distributed. All applications can be distributed in the sense that they, for example, use services on other nodes.</p> <p>Since a distributed application can move between nodes, some addressing mechanism is required to ensure that it can be addressed by other applications, regardless on which node it currently executes. This issue is not addressed here, but the <code>global</code> or <code>pg</code> modules in Kernel can be used for this purpose.</p> <h2 id="specifying-distributed-applications" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.2 Specifying Distributed Applications</div>  </h2> <p>Distributed applications are controlled by both the application controller and a distributed application controller process, <code>dist_ac</code>. Both these processes are part of the Kernel application. Distributed applications are thus specified by configuring the Kernel application, using the following configuration parameter (see also <code>kernel(6)</code>):</p> <p><code>distributed = [{Application, [Timeout,] NodeDesc}]</code></p> <ul> <li>Specifies where the application <code>Application = atom()</code> can execute.</li> <li> <code>NodeDesc = [Node | {Node,...,Node}]</code> is a list of node names in priority order. The order between nodes in a tuple is undefined.</li> <li> <code>Timeout = integer()</code> specifies how many milliseconds to wait before restarting the application at another node. It defaults to 0.</li> </ul> <p>For distribution of application control to work properly, the nodes where a distributed application can run must contact each other and negotiate where to start the application. This is done using the following configuration parameters in Kernel:</p> <ul> <li> <code>sync_nodes_mandatory = [Node]</code> - Specifies which other nodes must be started (within the time-out specified by <code>sync_nodes_timeout</code>).</li> <li> <code>sync_nodes_optional = [Node]</code> - Specifies which other nodes can be started (within the time-out specified by <code>sync_nodes_timeout</code>).</li> <li> <code>sync_nodes_timeout = integer() | infinity</code> - Specifies how many milliseconds to wait for the other nodes to start.</li> </ul> <p>When started, the node waits for all nodes specified by <code>sync_nodes_mandatory</code> and <code>sync_nodes_optional</code> to come up. When all nodes are up, or when all mandatory nodes are up and the time specified by <code>sync_nodes_timeout</code> has elapsed, all applications start. If not all mandatory nodes are up, the node terminates.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong></p> <p>An application <code>myapp</code> is to run at the node <code>cp1@cave</code>. If this node goes down, <code>myapp</code> is to be restarted at <code>cp2@cave</code> or <code>cp3@cave</code>. A system configuration file <code>cp1.config</code> for <code>cp1@cave</code> can look as follows:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">[{kernel,
  [{distributed, [{myapp, 5000, [cp1@cave, {cp2@cave, cp3@cave}]}]},
   {sync_nodes_mandatory, [cp2@cave, cp3@cave]},
   {sync_nodes_timeout, 5000}
  ]
 }
].</pre> <p>The system configuration files for <code>cp2@cave</code> and <code>cp3@cave</code> are identical, except for the list of mandatory nodes, which is to be <code>[cp1@cave, cp3@cave]</code> for <code>cp2@cave</code> and <code>[cp1@cave, cp2@cave]</code> for <code>cp3@cave</code>.</p> <div class="note"> <div class="label">Note</div> <div class="content">

<p>All involved nodes must have the same value for <code>distributed</code> and <code>sync_nodes_timeout</code>. Otherwise the system behaviour is undefined.</p> </div> </div> <h2 id="starting-and-stopping-distributed-applications" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.3 Starting and Stopping Distributed Applications</div>  </h2> <p>When all involved (mandatory) nodes have been started, the distributed application can be started by calling <code>application:start(Application)</code> at <strong>all of these nodes.</strong></p> <p>A boot script (see <code><a href="release_structure.html">Releases</a></code>) can be used that automatically starts the application.</p> <p>The application is started at the first operational node that is listed in the list of nodes in the <code>distributed</code> configuration parameter. The application is started as usual. That is, an application master is created and calls the application callback function:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">Module:start(normal, StartArgs)</pre> <p>Example:</p> <p>Continuing the example from the previous section, the three nodes are started, specifying the system configuration file:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
&gt; <code>erl -sname cp1 -config cp1</code>
&gt; <code>erl -sname cp2 -config cp2</code>
&gt; <code>erl -sname cp3 -config cp3</code></pre> <p>When all nodes are operational, <code>myapp</code> can be started. This is achieved by calling <code>application:start(myapp)</code> at all three nodes. It is then started at <code>cp1</code>, as shown in the following figure:</p>  <div class="doc-image-wrapper" id="dist1">  <p class="doc-image-caption">Figure 9.1: Application myapp - Situation 1</p> </div> <p>Similarly, the application must be stopped by calling <code>application:stop(Application)</code> at all involved nodes.</p> <h2 id="failover" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.4 Failover</div>  </h2> <p>If the node where the application is running goes down, the application is restarted (after the specified time-out) at the first operational node that is listed in the list of nodes in the <code>distributed</code> configuration parameter. This is called a <strong>failover</strong>.</p> <p>The application is started the normal way at the new node, that is, by the application master calling:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">Module:start(normal, StartArgs)</pre> <p>An exception is if the application has the <code>start_phases</code> key defined (see <code><a href="included_applications.html">Included Applications</a></code>). The application is then instead started by calling:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">Module:start({failover, Node}, StartArgs)</pre> <p>Here <code>Node</code> is the terminated node.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong></p> <p> If <code>cp1</code> goes down, the system checks which one of the other nodes, <code>cp2</code> or <code>cp3</code>, has the least number of running applications, but waits for 5 seconds for <code>cp1</code> to restart. If <code>cp1</code> does not restart and <code>cp2</code> runs fewer applications than <code>cp3</code>, <code>myapp</code> is restarted on <code>cp2</code>.</p>  <div class="doc-image-wrapper" id="dist2">  <p class="doc-image-caption">Figure 9.2: Application myapp - Situation 2</p> </div> <p>Suppose now that <code>cp2</code> goes also down and does not restart within 5 seconds. <code>myapp</code> is now restarted on <code>cp3</code>.</p>  <div class="doc-image-wrapper" id="dist3">  <p class="doc-image-caption">Figure 9.3: Application myapp - Situation 3</p> </div> <h2 id="takeover" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.5 Takeover</div>  </h2> <p>If a node is started, which has higher priority according to <code>distributed</code> than the node where a distributed application is running, the application is restarted at the new node and stopped at the old node. This is called a <strong>takeover</strong>.</p> <p>The application is started by the application master calling:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">Module:start({takeover, Node}, StartArgs)</pre> <p>Here <code>Node</code> is the old node.</p> <p><strong>Example: </strong></p> <p>If <code>myapp</code> is running at <code>cp3</code>, and if <code>cp2</code> now restarts, it does not restart <code>myapp</code>, as the order between the <code>cp2</code> and <code>cp3</code> nodes is undefined.</p>  <div class="doc-image-wrapper" id="dist4">  <p class="doc-image-caption">Figure 9.4: Application myapp - Situation 4</p> </div> <p>However, if <code>cp1</code> also restarts, the function <code>application:takeover/2</code> moves <code>myapp</code> to <code>cp1</code>, as <code>cp1</code> has a higher priority than <code>cp3</code> for this application. In this case, <code>Module:start({takeover, cp3@cave}, StartArgs)</code> is executed at <code>cp1</code> to start the application.</p>  <div class="doc-image-wrapper" id="dist5">  <p class="doc-image-caption">Figure 9.5: Application myapp - Situation 5</p> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
