If a phase is not defined for an included application, the function is not called for this phase and application.</p> <p>The following requirements apply to the <code>.app</code> file for an included application:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>{mod, {Module,StartArgs}}</code> option must be included. This option is used to find the callback module <code>Module</code> of the application. <code>StartArgs</code> is ignored, as <code>Module:start/2</code> is called only for the primary application.</li> <li>If the included application itself contains included applications, instead the <code>{mod, {application_starter, [Module,StartArgs]}}</code> option must be included.</li> <li>The <code>{start_phases, [{Phase,PhaseArgs}]}</code> option must be included, and the set of specified phases must be a subset of the set of phases specified for the primary application.</li> </ul> <p>When starting <code>prim_app</code> as defined above, the application controller calls the following callback functions before <code>application:start(prim_app)</code> returns a value:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">application:start(prim_app)
