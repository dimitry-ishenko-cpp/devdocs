 [{"1", [{load_module, m}]}],
 [{"1", [{load_module, m}]}]
}.</pre> <h2 id="changing-a-residence-module" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">12.2 Changing a Residence Module</div>  </h2> <p>In a system implemented according to the OTP design principles, all processes, except system processes and special processes, reside in one of the behaviours <code>supervisor</code>, <code>gen_server</code>, <code>gen_fsm</code>, <code>gen_statem</code> or <code>gen_event</code>. These belong to the STDLIB application and upgrading/downgrading normally requires an emulator restart.</p> <p>OTP thus provides no support for changing residence modules except in the case of <code><a href="#spec">special processes</a></code>.</p> <h2 id="changing-a-callback-module" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">12.3 Changing a Callback Module</div>  </h2> <p>A callback module is a functional module, and for code extensions simple code replacement is sufficient.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> When adding a function to <code>ch3</code>, as described in the example in <code><a href="release_handling.html#appup">Release Handling</a></code>, <code>ch_app.appup</code> looks as follows:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{"2",
 [{"1", [{load_module, ch3}]}],
 [{"1", [{load_module, ch3}]}]
}.</pre> <p>OTP also supports changing the internal state of behaviour processes, see <code><a href="#int_state">Changing Internal State</a></code>.</p> <h2 id="changing-internal-state" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">12.4 Changing Internal State</div>  </h2> <p>In this case, simple code replacement is not sufficient. The process must explicitly transform its state using the callback function <code>code_change</code> before switching to the new version of the callback module. Thus, synchronized code replacement is used.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider <code>gen_server</code> <code>ch3</code> from <code><a href="gen_server_concepts.html#ex">gen_server Behaviour</a></code>. The internal state is a term <code>Chs</code> representing the available channels. Assume you want to add a counter <code>N</code>, which keeps track of the number of <code>alloc</code> requests so far. This means that the format must be changed to <code>{Chs,N}</code>.</p> <p>The <code>.appup</code> file can look as follows:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{"2",
 [{"1", [{update, ch3, {advanced, []}}]}],
 [{"1", [{update, ch3, {advanced, []}}]}]
}.</pre> <p>The third element of the <code>update</code> instruction is a tuple <code>{advanced,Extra}</code>, which says that the affected processes are to do a state transformation before loading the new version of the module. This is done by the processes calling the callback function <code>code_change</code> (see the <code>gen_server(3)</code> manual page in STDLIB). The term <code>Extra</code>, in this case <code>[]</code>, is passed as is to the function:</p>  <pre id="code_change" data-language="erlang">-module(ch3).
...
-export([code_change/3]).
...
code_change({down, _Vsn}, {Chs, N}, _Extra) -&gt;
    {ok, Chs};
code_change(_Vsn, Chs, _Extra) -&gt;
    {ok, {Chs, 0}}.</pre> <p>The first argument is <code>{down,Vsn}</code> if there is a downgrade, or <code>Vsn</code> if there is a upgrade. The term <code>Vsn</code> is fetched from the 'original' version of the module, that is, the version you are upgrading from, or downgrading to.</p> <p>The version is defined by the module attribute <code>vsn</code>, if any. There is no such attribute in <code>ch3</code>, so in this case the version is the checksum (a huge integer) of the beam file, an uninteresting value, which is ignored.</p> <p>The other callback functions of <code>ch3</code> must also be modified and perhaps a new interface function must be added, but this is not shown here.</p> <h2 id="module-dependencies" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">12.5 Module Dependencies</div>  </h2> <p>Assume that a module is extended by adding an interface function, as in the example in <code><a href="release_handling.html#appup">Release Handling</a></code>, where a function <code>available/0</code> is added to <code>ch3</code>.</p> <p>If a call is added to this function, say in module <code>m1</code>, a runtime error could can occur during release upgrade if the new version of <code>m1</code> is loaded first and calls <code>ch3:available/0</code> before the new version of <code>ch3</code> is loaded.</p> <p>Thus, <code>ch3</code> must be loaded before <code>m1</code>, in the upgrade case, and conversely in the downgrade case. <code>m1</code> is said to be <strong>dependent on</strong> <code>ch3</code>. In a release handling instruction, this is expressed by the <code>DepMods</code> element:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{load_module, Module, DepMods}
{update, Module, {advanced, Extra}, DepMods}</pre> <p><code>DepMods</code> is a list of modules, on which <code>Module</code> is dependent.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> The module <code>m1</code> in application <code>myapp</code> is dependent on <code>ch3</code> when upgrading from "1" to "2", or downgrading from "2" to "1":</p> <pre data-language="erlang">myapp.appup:

{"2",
 [{"1", [{load_module, m1, [ch3]}]}],
 [{"1", [{load_module, m1, [ch3]}]}]
}.

ch_app.appup:

{"2",
 [{"1", [{load_module, ch3}]}],
 [{"1", [{load_module, ch3}]}]
}.</pre> <p>If instead <code>m1</code> and <code>ch3</code> belong to the same application, the <code>.appup</code> file can look as follows:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{"2",
 [{"1",
   [{load_module, ch3},
    {load_module, m1, [ch3]}]}],
 [{"1",
   [{load_module, ch3},
    {load_module, m1, [ch3]}]}]
}.</pre> <p><code>m1</code> is dependent on <code>ch3</code> also when downgrading. <code>systools</code> knows the difference between up- and downgrading and generates a correct <code>relup</code>, where <code>ch3</code> is loaded before <code>m1</code> when upgrading, but <code>m1</code> is loaded before <code>ch3</code> when downgrading.</p> <h2 id="changing-code-for-a-special-process" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">12.6 Changing Code for a Special Process</div>  </h2> <p>In this case, simple code replacement is not sufficient. When a new version of a residence module for a special process is loaded, the process must make a fully qualified call to its loop function to switch to the new code. Thus, synchronized code replacement must be used.</p> <div class="note"> <div class="label">Note</div> <div class="content">

<p>The name(s) of the user-defined residence module(s) must be listed in the <code>Modules</code> part of the child specification for the special process.

When started by a supervisor, the child specification can look as follows:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{ch4, {ch4, start_link, []},

 [{"1", [{update, ch4, {advanced, []}}]}]
}.</pre> <p>The <code>update</code> instruction must contain the tuple <code>{advanced,Extra}</code>. The instruction makes the special process call the callback function <code>system_code_change/4</code>, a function the user must implement.

system_code_change(Chs, _Module, _OldVsn, _Extra) -&gt;
    {ok, Chs}.</pre> <ul> <li>The first argument is the internal state <code>State</code>, passed from function <code>sys:handle_system_msg(Request, From, Parent, Module, Deb, State)</code>, and called by the special process when a system message is received. In <code>ch4</code>, the internal state is the set of available channels <code>Chs</code>.</li> <li>The second argument is the name of the module (<code>ch4</code>).</li> <li>The third argument is <code>Vsn</code> or <code>{down,Vsn}</code>, as described for <code>gen_server:code_change/3</code> in <code><a href="#code_change">Changing Internal State</a></code>.</li> </ul> <p>In this case, all arguments but the first are ignored and the function simply returns the internal state again. This is enough if the code only has been extended. If instead the internal state is changed (similar to the example in <code><a href="#int_state">Changing Internal State</a></code>), this is done in this function and <code>{ok,Chs2}</code> returned.</p> <h2 id="changing-a-supervisor" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">12.7 Changing a Supervisor</div>  </h2> <p>The supervisor behaviour supports changing the internal state, that is, changing the restart strategy and maximum restart frequency properties, as well as changing the existing child specifications.</p> <p>Child processes can be added or deleted, but this is not handled automatically. Instructions must be given by in the <code>.appup</code> file.</p> <h3 id="changing-properties" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Changing Properties</div>  </h3> <p>Since the supervisor is to change its internal state, synchronized code replacement is required. However, a special <code>update</code> instruction must be used.</p> <p>First, the new version of the callback module must be loaded, both in the case of upgrade and downgrade. Then the new return value of <code>init/1</code> can be checked and the internal state be changed accordingly.</p> <p>The following <code>upgrade</code> instruction is used for supervisors:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{update, Module, supervisor}</pre> <p><strong>Example:</strong> To change the restart strategy of <code>ch_sup</code> (from <code><a href="sup_princ.html#ex">Supervisor Behaviour</a></code>) from <code>one_for_one</code> to <code>one_for_all</code>, change the callback function <code>init/1</code> in <code>ch_sup.erl</code>:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">-module(ch_sup).

}.</pre> <h3 id="changing-child-specifications" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Changing Child Specifications</div>  </h3> <p>The instruction, and thus the <code>.appup</code> file, when changing an existing child specification, is the same as when changing properties as described earlier:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{"2",
 [{"1", [{update, ch_sup, supervisor}]}],
 [{"1", [{update, ch_sup, supervisor}]}]
}.</pre> <p>The changes do not affect existing child processes. For example, changing the start function only specifies how the child process is to be restarted, if needed later on.</p> <p>The id of the child specification cannot be changed.</p> <p>Changing the <code>Modules</code> field of the child specification can affect the release handling process itself, as this field is used to identify which processes are affected when doing a synchronized code replacement.</p>  <h3 id="adding-and-deleting-child-processes" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Adding and Deleting Child Processes</div>  </h3> <p>As stated earlier, changing child specifications does not affect existing child processes. New child specifications are automatically added, but not deleted. Child processes are not automatically started or terminated, this must be done using <code>apply</code> instructions.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> Assume a new child process <code>m1</code> is to be added to <code>ch_sup</code> when upgrading <code>ch_app</code> from "1" to "2". This means <code>m1</code> is to be deleted when downgrading from "2" to "1":</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{"2",

}.</pre> <p>The order of the instructions is important.</p> <p>The supervisor must be registered as <code>ch_sup</code> for the script to work. If the supervisor is not registered, it cannot be accessed directly from the script. Instead a help function that finds the pid of the supervisor and calls <code>supervisor:restart_child</code>, and so on, must be written. This function is then to be called from the script using the <code>apply</code> instruction.</p> <p>If the module <code>m1</code> is introduced in version "2" of <code>ch_app</code>, it must also be loaded when upgrading and deleted when downgrading:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{"2",
 [{"1",
   [{add_module, m1},

    {update, ch_sup, supervisor},
    {delete_module, m1}
   ]}]
}.</pre> <p>As stated earlier, the order of the instructions is important. When upgrading, <code>m1</code> must be loaded, and the supervisor child specification changed, before the new child process can be started.
