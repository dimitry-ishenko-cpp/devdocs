This is specified by the two keys <code>intensity</code> and <code>period</code> in the supervisor flags map returned by the callback function <code>init</code>:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">SupFlags = #{intensity =&gt; MaxR, period =&gt; MaxT, ...}</pre> <p>If more than <code>MaxR</code> number of restarts occur in the last <code>MaxT</code> seconds, the supervisor terminates all the child processes and then itself. The termination reason for the supervisor itself in that case will be <code>shutdown</code>.</p> <p>When the supervisor terminates, then the next higher-level supervisor takes some action. It either restarts the terminated supervisor or terminates itself.</p> <p>The intention of the restart mechanism is to prevent a situation where a process repeatedly dies for the same reason, only to be restarted again.</p> <p>The keys <code>intensity</code> and <code>period</code> are optional in the supervisor flags map. If they are not given, they default to <code>1</code> and <code>5</code>, respectively.</p> <h3 id="tuning-the-intensity-and-period" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Tuning the intensity and period</div>  </h3> <p>The default values are 1 restart per 5 seconds. This was chosen to be safe for most systems, even with deep supervision hierarchies, but you will probably want to tune the settings for your particular use case.</p> <p>First, the intensity decides how big bursts of restarts you want to tolerate. For example, you might want to accept a burst of at most 5 or 10 attempts, even within the same second, if it results in a successful restart.</p> <p>Second, you need to consider the sustained failure rate, if crashes keep happening but not often enough to make the supervisor give up. If you set intensity to 10 and set the period as low as 1, the supervisor will allow child processes to keep restarting up to 10 times per second, forever, filling your logs with crash reports until someone intervenes manually.</p> <p>You should therefore set the period to be long enough that you can accept that the supervisor keeps going at that rate. For example, if you have picked an intensity value of 5, then setting the period to 30 seconds will give you at most one restart per 6 seconds for any longer period of time, which means that your logs won't fill up too quickly, and you will have a chance to observe the failures and apply a fix.</p> <p>These choices depend a lot on your problem domain. If you don't have real time monitoring and ability to fix problems quickly, for example in an embedded system, you might want to accept at most one restart per minute before the supervisor should give up and escalate to the next level to try to clear the error automatically. On the other hand, if it is more important that you keep trying even at a high failure rate, you might want a sustained rate of as much as 1-2 restarts per second.</p> <p>Avoiding common mistakes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Do not forget to consider the burst rate. If you set intensity to 1 and period to 6, it gives the same sustained error rate as 5/30 or 10/60, but will not allow even 2 restart attempts in quick succession. This is probably not what you wanted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not set the period to a very high value if you want to tolerate bursts. If you set intensity to 5 and period to 3600 (one hour), the supervisor will allow a short burst of 5 restarts, but then gives up if it sees another single restart almost an hour later. You probably want to regard those crashes as separate incidents, so setting the period to 5 or 10 minutes will be more reasonable.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your application has multiple levels of supervision, then do not simply set the restart intensities to the same values on all levels. Keep in mind that the total number of restarts (before the top level supervisor gives up and terminates the application) will be the product of the intensity values of all the supervisors above the failing child process.</p> <p>For example, if the top level allows 10 restarts, and the next level also allows 10, a crashing child below that level will be restarted 100 times, which is probably excessive. Allowing at most 3 restarts for the top level supervisor might be a better choice in this case.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="automatic-shutdown" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">5.6 Automatic Shutdown</div>  </h2> <p>A supervisor can be configured to automatically shut itself down when <code><a href="#significant_child">significant children</a></code> terminate.</p> <p>This is useful when a supervisor represents a work unit of cooperating children, as opposed to independent workers. When the work unit has finished its work, that is, when any or all significant child processes have terminated, the supervisor should then shut down by terminating all remaining child processes in reverse start order according to the respective shutdown specifications, and then itself.</p> <p>Automatic shutdown is specified by the <code>auto_shutdown</code> key in the supervisor flags map returned by the callback function <code>init</code>:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">SupFlags = #{auto_shutdown =&gt; AutoShutdown, ...}</pre> <p>The <code>auto_shutdown</code> key is optional in this map.

Unless the call is made from a spawned process, this will result in a deadlock, as the supervisor waits for the child to exit as part of its shutdown procedure, whereas the child waits for the supervisor to shut down. If the child is trapping exits, this deadlock will last until the <code><a href="#shutdown">shutdown</a></code> timeout for the child expires.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a supervisor is stopping a child, it will wait for the shutdown to complete before accepting other calls, that is, the supervisor will be unresponsive until then. If the termination takes some time to complete, especially when the considerations outlined in the previous point were not taken into account carefully, said supervisor might become unresponsive for a long time.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Instead, it is generally a better approach to rely on <code><a href="#automatic-shutdown">Automatic Shutdown</a></code>.</p> <ol> <li> <p>A child process does not need to know anything about its supervisor and its respective parent, not even that it is part of a supervision tree in the first place. It is instead only the supervisor which hosts the child who must know which of its children are <code><a href="#significant_child">significant</a></code> ones, and when to shut itself down.</p> </li> <li> <p>A child process does not need to do anything special to shut down the work unit it is part of. All it needs to do is terminate normally when it has finished the task it was started for.</p> </li> <li> <p>A supervisor that is automatically shutting itself down will perform the required shutdown steps fully independent of its parent supervisor. The parent supervisor will only notice that its child supervisor has terminated in the end. As the parent supervisor is not involved in the shutdown process, it will not be blocked.</p> </li> </ol> </div><div class="_attribution">
