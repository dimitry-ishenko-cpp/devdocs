 end.</pre> <h3 id="initial-heap-size" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Initial Heap Size</div>  </h3> <p>The default initial heap size of 233 words is quite conservative to support Erlang systems with hundreds of thousands or even millions of processes. The garbage collector grows and shrinks the heap as needed.</p> <p>In a system that use comparatively few processes, performance <strong>might</strong> be improved by increasing the minimum heap size using either the <code>+h</code> option for <code>erl</code> or on a process-per-process basis using the <code>min_heap_size</code> option for <code>spawn_opt/4</code>.</p> <p>The gain is twofold:</p> <ul> <li>Although the garbage collector grows the heap, it grows it step-by-step, which is more costly than directly establishing a larger heap when the process is spawned.</li> <li>The garbage collector can also shrink the heap if it is much larger than the amount of data stored on it; setting the minimum heap size prevents that.</li> </ul> <div class="warning"> <div class="label">Warning</div> <div class="content">

<p>The emulator probably uses more memory, and because garbage collections occur less frequently, huge binaries can be kept much longer.</p>
</div> </div> <p>In systems with many processes, computation tasks that run for a short time can be spawned off into a new process with a higher minimum heap size. When the process is done, it sends the result of the computation to another process and terminates. If the minimum heap size is calculated properly, the process might not have to do any garbage collections at all. <strong>This optimization is not to be attempted without proper measurements.</strong></p> <h2 id="sending-messages" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.2 Sending Messages</div>  </h2> <p>All data in messages sent between Erlang processes is copied, except for <code><a href="binaryhandling.html#refc_binary">refc binaries</a></code> and <code><a href="#literal-pool">literals</a></code> on the same Erlang node.</p> <p>When a message is sent to a process on another Erlang node, it is first encoded to the Erlang External Format before being sent through a TCP/IP socket. The receiving Erlang node decodes the message and distributes it to the correct process.</p> <h2 id="receiving-messages" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.3 Receiving messages</div>  </h2> <p>The cost of receiving messages depends on how complicated the <code>receive</code> expression is. A simple expression that matches any message is very cheap because it retrieves the first message in the message queue:</p> <p><strong>DO</strong></p> <pre data-language="erlang">receive
    Message -&gt; handle_msg(Message)
end.</pre> <p>However, this is not always convenient: we can receive a message that we do not know how to handle at this point, so it is common to only match the messages we expect:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">receive
    {Tag, Message} -&gt; handle_msg(Message)
end.</pre> <p>While this is convenient it means that the entire message queue must be searched until it finds a matching message. This is very expensive for processes with long message queues, so we have added an optimization for the common case of sending a request and waiting for a response shortly after:</p> <p><strong>DO</strong></p> <pre data-language="erlang">MRef = monitor(process, Process),
Process ! {self(), MRef, Request},
receive
    {MRef, Reply} -&gt;
        erlang:demonitor(MRef, [flush]),
        handle_reply(Reply);
    {'DOWN', MRef, _, _, Reason} -&gt;
        handle_error(Reason)
end.</pre> <p>Since the compiler knows that the reference created by <code>monitor/2</code> cannot exist before the call (since it is a globally unique identifier), and that the <code>receive</code> only matches messages that contain said reference, it will tell the emulator to search only the messages that arrived after the call to <code>monitor/2</code>.</p> <p>The above is a simple example where one is but guaranteed that the optimization will take, but what about more complicated code?</p> <h3 id="option-recv_opt_info" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">Option recv_opt_info</div>  </h3> <p>Use the <code>recv_opt_info</code> option to have the compiler print information about receive optimizations. It can be given either to the compiler or <code>erlc</code>:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">erlc +recv_opt_info Mod.erl</pre> <p>or passed through an environment variable:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">export ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=recv_opt_info</pre> <p>Notice that <code>recv_opt_info</code> is not meant to be a permanent option added to your <code>Makefile</code>s, because all messages that it generates cannot be eliminated. Therefore, passing the option through the environment is in most cases the most practical approach.</p> <p>The warnings look as follows:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">efficiency_guide.erl:194: Warning: INFO: receive matches any message, this is always fast

The following function does not build the tuple every time it is called (only to have it discarded the next time the garbage collector was run), but the tuple is located in the module's literal pool:</p> <p><strong>DO</strong></p> <pre data-language="erlang">days_in_month(M) -&gt;
    element(M, {31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31}).</pre> <p>If a literal, or a term that contains a literal, is inserted into an Ets table, it is <strong>copied</strong>. The reason is that the module containing the literal can be unloaded in the future.</p> <p>When a literal is sent to another process, it is <strong>not</strong> copied. When a module holding a literal is unloaded, the literal will be copied to the heap of all processes that hold references to that literal.</p> <p>There also exists a global literal pool that is managed by the <code>persistent_term</code> module.</p> <p>By default, 1 GB of virtual address space is reserved for all literal pools (in BEAM code and persistent terms). The amount of virtual address space reserved for literals can be changed by using the <code>+MIscs option</code> when starting the emulator.</p> <p>Here is an example how the reserved virtual address space for literals can be raised to 2 GB (2048 MB):</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
erl +MIscs 2048</pre> <h2 id="loss-of-sharing" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.5 Loss of Sharing</div>  </h2> <p>An Erlang term can have shared subterms. Here is a simple example:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">{SubTerm, SubTerm}</pre> <p>Shared subterms are <strong>not</strong> preserved in the following cases:</p> <ul> <li>When a term is sent to another process</li> <li>When a term is passed as the initial process arguments in the <code>spawn</code> call</li> <li>When a term is stored in an Ets table</li> </ul> <p>That is an optimization. Most applications do not send messages with shared subterms.</p> <p>The following example shows how a shared subterm can be created:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">kilo_byte() -&gt;
    kilo_byte(10, [42]).

kilo_byte(0, Acc) -&gt;
    Acc;
kilo_byte(N, Acc) -&gt;
    kilo_byte(N-1, [Acc|Acc]).</pre> <p><code>kilo_byte/1</code> creates a deep list. If <code>list_to_binary/1</code> is called, the deep list can be converted to a binary of 1024 bytes:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
1&gt; <code>byte_size(list_to_binary(efficiency_guide:kilo_byte())).</code>
1024</pre> <p>Using the <code>erts_debug:size/1</code> BIF, it can be seen that the deep list only requires 22 words of heap space:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
2&gt; <code>erts_debug:size(efficiency_guide:kilo_byte()).</code>
22</pre> <p>Using the <code>erts_debug:flat_size/1</code> BIF, the size of the deep list can be calculated if sharing is ignored. It becomes the size of the list when it has been sent to another process or stored in an Ets table:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
3&gt; <code>erts_debug:flat_size(efficiency_guide:kilo_byte()).</code>
4094</pre> <p>It can be verified that sharing will be lost if the data is inserted into an Ets table:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
4&gt; <code>T = ets:new(tab, []).</code>
#Ref&lt;0.1662103692.2407923716.214181&gt;
5&gt; <code>ets:insert(T, {key,efficiency_guide:kilo_byte()}).</code>
true
6&gt; <code>erts_debug:size(element(2, hd(ets:lookup(T, key)))).</code>
4094
7&gt; <code>erts_debug:flat_size(element(2, hd(ets:lookup(T, key)))).</code>
4094</pre> <p>When the data has passed through an Ets table, <code>erts_debug:size/1</code> and <code>erts_debug:flat_size/1</code> return the same value. Sharing has been lost.</p> <p>It is possible to build an <strong>experimental</strong> variant of the runtime system that will preserve sharing when copying terms by giving the <code>--enable-sharing-preserving</code> option to the <code>configure</code> script.</p> <h2 id="smp-emulator" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.6 SMP Emulator</div>  </h2> <p>The emulator takes advantage of a multi-core or multi-CPU computer by running several Erlang scheduler threads (typically, the same as the number of cores).</p> <p>To gain performance from a multi-core computer, your application <strong>must have more than one runnable Erlang process</strong> most of the time. Otherwise, the Erlang emulator can still only run one Erlang process at the time.</p> <p>Benchmarks that appear to be concurrent are often sequential. The estone benchmark, for example, is entirely sequential. So is the most common implementation of the "ring benchmark"; usually one process is active, while the others wait in a <code>receive</code> statement.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
