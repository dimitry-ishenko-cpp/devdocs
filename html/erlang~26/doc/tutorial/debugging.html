To maximize performance the code is called directly by the same threads executing Erlang beam code and has full access to all the memory of the OS process. A buggy NIF/driver can thus make severe damage by corrupting memory. </p> <p> In a best case scenario such memory corruption is detected immediately causing the Beam to crash generating a core dump file which can be analyzed to find the bug. However, it is very common for memory corruption bugs to not be immediately detected when the faulty write happens, but instead much later, for example when the calling Erlang process is garbage collected. When that happens it can be very hard to find the root cause of the memory corruption by analysing the core dump. All traces that could have indicated which specific buggy NIF/driver that caused the corruption may be long gone. </p> <h2 id="the-debug-emulator" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.2 The debug emulator</div>  </h2> <p> One way to make debugging easier is to run an emulator built with target <code>debug</code>. It will </p> <ul> <li> <p> <strong>Increase probability of detecting bugs earlier</strong>. It contains a lot more runtime checks to ensure correct use of internal interfaces and data structures. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Generate a core dump that is easier to analyze</strong>. Compiler optimizations are turned off, which stops the compiler from "optimizing away" variables, thus making it easier/possible to inspect their state. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Detect lock order violations</strong>. A runtime lock checker will verify that the locks in the <code>erl_nif</code> and <code>erl_driver</code> APIs are seized in a consistent order that cannot result in deadlock bugs. </p> </li> </ul> <p> In fact, we recommend to use the debug emulator as default during development of NIFs and drivers, regardless if you are troubleshooting bugs or not. Some subtle bugs may not be detected by the normal emulator and just happen to work anyway by chance. However, another version of the emulator, or even different circumstances within the same emulator, may cause the bug to later provoke all kinds of problems. </p> <p> The main disadvantage of the <code>debug</code> emulator is its reduced performance. The extra runtime checks and lack of compiler optimizations may result in a slowdown with a factor of two or more depending on load. The memory footprint should be about the same. </p> <p> If the <code>debug</code> emulator is part of the Erlang/OTP installation, it can be started with the <code>-emu_type</code> option. </p> <pre data-language="erlang">

</pre> <p> If the <code>debug</code> emulator is not part of the installation, you need to <code> build it from the Erlang/OTP source code</code>. After building from source either make an Erlang/OTP installation or you can run the debug emulator directly in the source tree with the <code>cerl</code> script: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">

</pre> <p> The <code>cerl</code> script can also be used as a convenient way to start the debugger <code>gdb</code> for core dump analysis: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">
&gt; <code>$ERL_TOP/bin/cerl -debug -core core.12345</code>
or
&gt; <code>$ERL_TOP/bin/cerl -debug -rcore core.12345</code>
</pre> <p> The first variant starts Emacs and runs <code>gdb</code> within, while the other <code>-rcore</code> runs <code>gdb</code> directly in the terminal. Apart from starting <code>gdb</code> with the correct <code>beam.debug.smp</code> executable file it will also read the file <code>$ERL_TOP/erts/etc/unix/etp-commands</code> which contains a lot of <code>gdb</code> command for inspecting a beam core dump. For example, the command <code>etp</code> that will print the content of an Erlang term (<code>Eterm</code>) in plain Erlang syntax. </p> <h2 id="address-sanitizer" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.3 Address Sanitizer</div>  </h2> <p> <code><a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html"> AddressSanitizer</a></code> (asan) is an open source programming tool that detects memory corruption bugs such as buffer overflows, use-after-free and memory leaks. AddressSanitizer is based on compiler instrumentation and is supported by both gcc and clang. </p> <p> Similar to the <code>debug</code> emulator, the <code>asan</code> emulator runs slower than normal, about 2-3 times slower. However, it also has a larger memory footprint, about 3 times more memory than normal. </p> <p> To get full effect you should compile both your own NIF/driver code as well as the Erlang emulator with AddressSanitizer instrumentation. Compile your own code by passing option <code>-fsanitize=address</code> to gcc or clang. Other recommended options that will improve the fault identification are <code>-fno-common</code> and <code>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</code>. </p> <p> Build and run the emulator with AddressSanitizer support by using the same procedure as for the debug emulator, except use the <code>asan</code> build target instead of <code>debug</code>. </p> <dl> <dt class="title-link"><strong>Run in source tree</strong></dt> <dd> <p> If you run the <code>asan</code> emulator directly in the source tree with the <code>cerl</code> script you only need to set environment variable <code>ASAN_LOG_DIR</code> to the directory where the error log files will be generated. </p> <pre data-language="erlang">

It can also find memory corruption bugs and memory leaks similar to <code>asan</code>. Valgrind is not as good at buffer overflow bugs, but it will find use of undefined data, which is a type of error that <code>asan</code> cannot detect. </p> <p> Valgrind is much slower than <code>asan</code> and it is incapable at exploiting CPU multicore processing. We therefore recommend <code>asan</code> as the first choice before trying valgrind. </p> <p> Valgrind runs as a virtual machine itself, emulating execution of hardware machine instructions. This means you can run almost any program unchanged on valgrind. However, we have found that the beam executable benefits from being compiled with special adaptions for running on valgrind. </p> <p> Build the emulator with <code>valgrind</code> target the same as is done for <code>debug</code> and <code>asan</code>. Note that <code>valgrind</code> needs to be installed on the machine before the build starts. </p> <p> Run the <code>valgrind</code> emulator directly in the source tree with the <code>cerl</code> script.

</pre> <h2 id="rr---record-and-replay" class="title-link"> <div class="title-name">9.5 rr - Record and Replay</div>  </h2> <p> Last but not least, the fantastic interactive debugging tool <code><a href="https://rr-project.org/">rr</a></code>, developed by Mozilla as open source. <code>rr</code> stands for Record and Replay. While a core dump represents only a static snapshot of the OS process when it crashed, with <code>rr</code> you instead record the entire session, from start of the OS process to the end (the crash). You can then replay that session from within <code>gdb</code>. Single step, set breakpoints and watchpoints, and even <strong>execute backwards</strong>. </p> <p> Considering its powerful utility, <code>rr</code> is remarkably light weight. It runs on Linux with any reasonably modern x86 CPU. You may get a two times slowdown when executing in recording mode. The big weakness is its inability to exploite CPU multicore processing. If the bug is a race condition between concurrently running threads, it may be hard to reproduce with <code>rr</code>. </p> <p> <code>rr</code> does not require any special instrumented compilation. However, if possible, run it together with the <code>debug</code> emulator, as that will result in a much nicer debugging experience. You run <code>rr</code> in the source tree using the <code>cerl</code> script. </p> <p> Here is an example of a typical session. First we catch the crash in an rr recording session: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">
