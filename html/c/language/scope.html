    <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Scope</h1>            <p>Each <a href="identifier.html" title="c/language/identifier">identifier</a> that appears in a C program is <i>visible</i> (that is, may be used) only in some possibly discontiguous portion of the source code called its <i>scope</i>.</p>
<p>Within a scope, an identifier may designate more than one entity only if the entities are in different <a href="name_space.html" title="c/language/name space">name spaces</a>.</p>
<p>C has four kinds of scopes:</p>

<h3 id="Notes"> Notes</h3> <p>Prior to C89, identifiers with external linkage had file scope even when introduced within a block, and because of that, a C89 compiler is not required to diagnose the use of an extern identifier that has gone out of scope (such use is undefined behavior).</p>
<p>Local variables within a loop body can hide variables declared in the init clause of a <a href="for.html" title="c/language/for">for</a> loop in C (their scope is nested), but cannot do that in C++.</p>
<p>Unlike C++, C has no struct scope: names declared within a struct/union/enum declaration are in the same scope as the struct declaration (except that data members are in their own <a href="name_space.html" title="c/language/name space">member name space</a>):</p>
