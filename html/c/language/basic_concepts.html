    <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Basic concepts</h1>            <p>This section provides definitions for the specific terminology and the concepts used when describing the C programming language.</p>
<p>A C program is a sequence of text files (typically header and source files) that contain <a href="declarations.html" title="c/language/declarations">declarations</a>. They undergo <a href="translation_phases.html" title="c/language/translation phases">translation</a> to become an executable program, which is executed when the OS calls its <a href="main_function.html" title="c/language/main function">main function</a> (unless it is itself the OS or another <i>freestanding</i> program, in which case the entry point is implementation-defined).</p>
<p>Certain words in a C program have special meaning, they are <a href="../keyword.html" title="c/keyword">keywords</a>. Others can be used as <a href="identifier.html" title="c/language/identifier">identifiers</a>, which may be used to identify <a href="object.html" title="c/language/object">objects</a>, <a href="functions.html" title="c/language/functions">functions</a>, <a href="struct.html" title="c/language/struct">struct</a>, <a href="union.html" title="c/language/union">union</a>, or <a href="enum.html" title="c/language/enum">enumeration</a> tags, their members, <a href="typedef.html" title="c/language/typedef">typedef</a> names, <a href="statements.html#Labels" title="c/language/statements">labels</a>, or <a href="../preprocessor/replace.html" title="c/preprocessor/replace">macros</a>.</p>
<p>Each identifier (other than macro) is only valid within a part of the program called its <a href="scope.html" title="c/language/scope">scope</a> and belongs to one of four kinds of <a href="name_space.html" title="c/language/name space">name spaces</a>. Some identifiers have <a href="storage_duration.html" title="c/language/storage duration">linkage</a> which makes them refer to the same entities when they appear in different scopes or translation units.</p>
<p>Definitions of functions include sequences of <a href="statements.html" title="c/language/statements">statements</a> and <a href="declarations.html" title="c/language/declarations">declarations</a>, some of which include <a href="expressions.html" title="c/language/expressions">expressions</a>, which specify the computations to be performed by the program.</p>
<p><a href="declarations.html" title="c/language/declarations">Declarations</a> and <a href="expressions.html" title="c/language/expressions">expressions</a> create, destroy, access, and manipulate <a href="object.html" title="c/language/object">objects</a>. Each <a href="object.html" title="c/language/object">object</a>, <a href="functions.html" title="c/language/functions">function</a>, and <a href="expressions.html" title="c/language/expressions">expression</a> in C is associated with a <a href="type.html" title="c/language/type">type</a>.</p>
