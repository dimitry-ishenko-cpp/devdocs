</table> <h3 id="Explanation"> Explanation</h3> <p>Within a struct object, addresses of its elements (and the addresses of the bit-field allocation units) increase in order in which the members were defined. A pointer to a struct can be cast to a pointer to its first member (or, if the member is a bit-field, to its allocation unit). Likewise, a pointer to the first member of a struct can be cast to a pointer to the enclosing struct. There may be unnamed padding between any two members of a struct or after the last member, but not before the first member. The size of a struct is at least as large as the sum of the sizes of its members.</p>
<table class="t-rev-begin"> <tr class="t-rev t-since-c99">
<td> <p>If a struct defines at least one named member, it is allowed to additionally declare its last member with incomplete array type. When an element of the flexible array member is accessed (in an expression that uses operator <code>.</code> or <code>-&gt;</code> with the flexible array member's name as the right-hand-side operand), then the struct behaves as if the array member had the longest size fitting in the memory allocated for this object. If no additional storage was allocated, it behaves as if an array with 1 element, except that the behavior is undefined if that element is accessed or a pointer one past that element is produced. Initialization and the assignment operator ignore the flexible array member. <code>sizeof</code> omits it, but may have more trailing padding than the omission would imply. Structures with flexible array members (or unions who have a recursive-possibly structure member with flexible array member) cannot appear as array elements or as members of other structures.</p>
<div class="c source-c"><pre data-language="c">struct s { int n; double d[]; }; // s.d is a flexible array member
 
struct s t1 = { 0 };          // OK, d is as if double d[1], but UB to access
struct s t2 = { 1, { 4.2 } }; // error: initialization ignores flexible array
 
// if sizeof (double) == 8
struct s *s1 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 64); // as if d was double d[8]
struct s *s2 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 40); // as if d was double d[5]
 
s1 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 10); // now as if d was double d[1]. Two bytes excess.
double *dp = &amp;(s1-&gt;d[0]);    // OK
*dp = 42;                    // OK
s1-&gt;d[1]++;                  // Undefined behavior. 2 excess bytes can't be accessed

<p>Because members of incomplete type are not allowed, and a struct type is not complete until the end of the definition, a struct cannot have a member of its own type. A pointer to its own type is allowed, and is commonly used to implement nodes in linked lists or trees.</p>
<p>Because a struct declaration does not establish <a href="scope.html" title="c/language/scope">scope</a>, nested types, enumerations and enumerators introduced by declarations within <span class="t-spar">struct-declaration-list</span> are visible in the surrounding scope where the struct is defined.</p>
