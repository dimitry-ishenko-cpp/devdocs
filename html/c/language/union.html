    <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Union declaration</h1>            <p>A union is a type consisting of a sequence of members whose storage overlaps (as opposed to struct, which is a type consisting of a sequence of members whose storage is allocated in an ordered sequence). The value of at most one of the members can be stored in a union at any one time.</p>
<p>The <a href="declarations.html" title="c/language/declarations">type specifier</a> for a union is identical to the <a href="struct.html" title="c/language/struct"><code>struct</code></a> type specifier except for the keyword used:</p>

</table> <h3 id="Explanation"> Explanation</h3> <p>The union is only as big as necessary to hold its largest member (additional unnamed trailing padding may also be added). The other members are allocated in the same bytes as part of that largest member.</p>
<p>A pointer to a union can be cast to a pointer to each of its members (if a union has bit-field members, the pointer to a union can be cast to the pointer to the bit-field's underlying type). Likewise, a pointer to any member of a union can be cast to a pointer to the enclosing union.</p>
<table class="t-rev-begin"> <tr class="t-rev t-since-c99">
<td> <p>If the member used to access the contents of a union is not the same as the member last used to store a value, the object representation of the value that was stored is reinterpreted as an object representation of the new type (this is known as <i>type punning</i>). If the size of the new type is larger than the size of the last-written type, the contents of the excess bytes are unspecified (and may be a trap representation). Before C99 TC3 (DR 283) this behaviour was undefined, but commonly implemented this way.</p>

<td> <p>Similar to struct, an unnamed member of a union whose type is a union without <span class="t-spar">name</span> is known as <i>anonymous union</i>. Every member of an anonymous union is considered to be a member of the enclosing struct or union keeping their union layout. This applies recursively if the enclosing struct or union is also anonymous.</p>
