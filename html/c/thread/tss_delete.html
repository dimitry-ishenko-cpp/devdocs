<p>The destructor, if one was registered by <code><a href="tss_create.html" title="c/thread/tss create">tss_create</a></code>, is not called (they are only called at thread exit, either by <code><a href="thrd_exit.html" title="c/thread/thrd exit">thrd_exit</a></code> or by returning from the thread function), it is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that every thread that is aware of <code>tss_id</code> performed all necessary cleanup, before the call to <code>tss_delete</code> is made.</p>
<p>If <code>tss_delete</code> is called while another thread is executing destructors for <code>tss_id</code>, it's unspecified whether this changes the number of invocations to the associated destructor.</p>
<p>If <code>tss_delete</code> is called while the calling thread is executing destructors, then the destructor associated with <code>tss_id</code> will not be executed again on this thread.</p>

<h3 id="Notes"> Notes</h3> <p>The POSIX equivalent of this function is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_key_delete.html"><code>pthread_key_delete</code></a>.</p>
<p>The reason <code>tss_delete</code> never calls destructors is that the destructors (called at thread exit) are normally intended to be executed by the same thread that originally set the value (via <code><a href="tss_set.html" title="c/thread/tss set">tss_set</a></code>) that the destructor will be dealing with, and may even rely on the values of that or other thread-specific data as seen by that thread. The thread executing <code>tss_delete</code> has no access to other threads' TSS. Even if it were possible to call the destructor for each thread's own value associated with <code>tss_id</code>, <code>tss_delete</code> would have to synchronize with every thread if only to examine whether the value of this TSS in that thread is null (destructors are only called against non-null values).</p>
