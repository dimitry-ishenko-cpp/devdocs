<h1 id="page-subtitle">Extending and altering Drupal</h1>      <p>Overview of extensions and alteration methods for Drupal.</p> <h3 id="sec_types">Types of extensions</h3> <p>Drupal's core behavior can be extended and altered via these three basic types of extensions:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Themes</strong>: Themes alter the appearance of Drupal sites. They can include template files, which alter the HTML markup and other raw output of the site; CSS files, which alter the styling applied to the HTML; and JavaScript, Flash, images, and other files. For more information, see the <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-render-theme.api.php/group/theme_render/8.1.x.html" title="Overview of the Theme system and Render API." class="local">Theme system and render API topic</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/theme-guide/8">https://www.drupal.org/theme-guide/8</a>
</li> <li>
<strong>Modules</strong>: Modules add to or alter the behavior and functionality of Drupal, by using one or more of the methods listed below. For more information about creating modules, see <a href="https://www.drupal.org/developing/modules/8">https://www.drupal.org/developing/modules/8</a>
</li> <li>
<strong>Installation profiles</strong>: Installation profiles can be used to create distributions, which are complete specific-purpose packages of Drupal including additional modules, themes, and data. For more information, see <a href="https://www.drupal.org/developing/distributions">https://www.drupal.org/developing/distributions</a>.</li> </ul> <h3 id="sec_alter">Alteration methods for modules</h3> <p>Here is a list of the ways that modules can alter or extend Drupal's core behavior, or the behavior of other modules:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Hooks</strong>: Specially-named functions that a module defines, which are discovered and called at specific times, usually to alter behavior or data. See the <a href="../hooks/8.1.x.html" title="Define functions that alter the behavior of Drupal core." class="local">Hooks topic</a> for more information.</li> <li>
<strong>Plugins</strong>: Classes that a module defines, which are discovered and instantiated at specific times to add functionality. See the <a href="../plugin_api/8.1.x.html" title="Using the Plugin API" class="local">Plugin API topic</a> for more information.</li> <li>
<strong>Entities</strong>: Special plugins that define entity types for storing new types of content or configuration in Drupal. See the <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-entity-entity.api.php/group/entity_api/8.1.x.html" title="Describes how to define and manipulate content and configuration entities." class="local">Entity API topic</a> for more information.</li> <li>
<strong>Services</strong>: Classes that perform basic operations within Drupal, such as accessing the database and sending email. See the <a href="../container/8.1.x.html" title="Overview of the Dependency Injection Container and Services." class="local">Dependency Injection Container and Services topic</a> for more information.</li> <li>
<strong>Routing</strong>: Providing or altering "routes", which are URLs that Drupal responds to, or altering routing behavior with event listener classes. See the <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-menu-menu.api.php/group/menu/8.1.x.html" title="Define the navigation menus, local actions and tasks, and contextual links." class="local">Routing and menu topic</a> for more information.</li> <li>
<strong>Events</strong>: Modules can register as event subscribers; when an event is dispatched, a method is called on each registered subscriber, allowing each one to react. See the <a href="../events/8.1.x.html" title="Overview of event dispatch and subscribing" class="local">Events topic</a> for more information.</li> </ul> <h3 id="sec_sample">*.info.yml files</h3> <p>Extensions must each be located in a directory whose name matches the short name (or machine name) of the extension, and this directory must contain a file named machine_name.info.yml (where machine_name is the machine name of the extension). See <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-extension-infoparserinterface.php/function/infoparserinterface-parse/8.1.x.html" title="Parses Drupal module, theme and profile .info.yml files." class="local">\Drupal\Core\Extension\InfoParserInterface::parse</a>() for documentation of the format of .info.yml files.</p> <h3>File</h3>
