<h1 id="page-subtitle">Information types</h1>      <p>Types of information in Drupal.</p> <p>Drupal has several distinct types of information, each with its own methods for storage and retrieval:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Content</strong>: Information meant to be displayed on your site: articles, basic pages, images, files, custom blocks, etc. Content is stored and accessed using <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-entity-entity.api.php/group/entity_api/8.1.x.html" title="Describes how to define and manipulate content and configuration entities." class="local">Entities</a>.</li> <li>
<strong>Session</strong>: Information about individual users' interactions with the site, such as whether they are logged in. This is really "state" information, but it is not stored the same way so it's a separate type here. Session information is available from the Request object. The session implements <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/vendor%21symfony%21http-foundation%21Session%21SessionInterface.php/interface/SessionInterface/8.1.x" title="Interface for the session." class="local">\Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Session\SessionInterface</a>.</li> <li>
<strong>State</strong>: Information of a temporary nature, generally machine-generated and not human-edited, about the current state of your site. Examples: the time when Cron was last run, whether node access permissions need rebuilding, etc. See <a href="../state_api/8.1.x.html" title="Information about the State API." class="local">the State API topic</a> for more information.</li> <li>
<strong>Configuration</strong>: Information about your site that is generally (or at least can be) human-edited, but is not Content, and is meant to be relatively permanent. Examples: the name of your site, the content types and views you have defined, etc. See <a href="../config_api/8.1.x.html" title="Information about the Configuration API." class="local">the Configuration API topic</a> for more information.</li> </ul> <h3>See also</h3> <p> <a href="../cache/8.1.x.html" title="Information about the Drupal Cache API" class="local">Cache API</a></p> <p><a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-language-language.api.php/group/i18n/8.1.x.html" title="Internationalization and translation" class="local">Internationalization</a></p> <h3>File</h3>
