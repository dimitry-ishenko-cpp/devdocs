<h1 id="page-subtitle">function filter_fallback_format</h1>     <pre class="signature">filter_fallback_format()</pre> <p>Returns the ID of the fallback text format that all users have access to.</p> <p>The fallback text format is a regular text format in every respect, except it does not participate in the filter permission system and cannot be disabled. It needs to exist because any user who has permission to create formatted content must always have at least one text format they can use.</p> <p>Because the fallback format is available to all users, it should always be configured securely. For example, when the Filter module is installed, this format is initialized to output plain text. Installation profiles and site administrators have the freedom to configure it further.</p> <p>Note that the fallback format is completely distinct from the default format, which differs per user and is simply the first format which that user has access to. The default and fallback formats are only guaranteed to be the same for users who do not have access to any other format; otherwise, the fallback format's weight determines its placement with respect to the user's other formats.</p> <p>Any modules implementing a format deletion functionality must not delete this format.</p> <h3>Return value</h3> <p> string|null The ID of the fallback text format.</p> <h3>See also</h3> <p> <a href="../../../core-modules-filter-filter.api.php/function/hook_filter_format_disable/8.1.x.html" title="Perform actions when a text format has been disabled." class="local">hook_filter_format_disable</a>()</p> <p><a href="../filter_default_format/8.1.x.html" title="Returns the ID of the default text format for a particular user." class="local">filter_default_format</a>()</p>  <h3>File</h3>
