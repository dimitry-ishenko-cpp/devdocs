It is called by self::processForm() when all user input processing, including calling validation and submission handlers, for the request is finished. If a validate or submit handler set $form_state-&gt;isRebuilding() to TRUE, and if other conditions don't preempt a rebuild from happening, then this function is called to generate a new $form, the next step in the form workflow, to be returned for rendering.</p> <p>Ajax form submissions are almost always multi-step workflows, so that is one common use-case during which form rebuilding occurs.</p> <h3>Parameters</h3> <p> <strong>string $form_id</strong>: The unique string identifying the desired form. If a function with that name exists, it is called to build the form array.</p> <p><strong><a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-form-formstateinterface.php/interface/formstateinterface/8.1.x.html" title="Provides an interface for an object containing the current state of a form." class="local">\Drupal\Core\Form\FormStateInterface</a> $form_state</strong>: The current state of the form.</p> <p><strong>array|null $old_form</strong>: (optional) A previously built $form. Used to retain the #build_id and #action properties in Ajax callbacks and similar partial form rebuilds. The only properties copied from $old_form are the ones which both exist in $old_form and for which $form_state-&gt;getRebuildInfo()['copy'][PROPERTY] is TRUE. If $old_form is not passed, the entire $form is rebuilt freshly. 'rebuild_info' needs to be a separate top-level property next to 'build_info', since the contained data must not be cached.</p> <h3>Return value</h3> <p> array The newly built form.</p> <p class="api-override">Overrides <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-form-formbuilderinterface.php/function/formbuilderinterface-rebuildform/8.1.x.html">FormBuilderInterface::rebuildForm</a></p> <h3>See also</h3> <p> self::processForm()</p>  <h3>File</h3>

  // the URL itself to transfer its state across steps. Although $form_state
  // throws an exception based on the request method rather than the form's
  // method, we base the decision to cache on the form method, because:
  // - It's the form method that defines what the form needs to do to manage
  //   its state.
  // - rebuildForm() should only be called after successful input processing,
  //   which means the request method matches the form method, and if not,
