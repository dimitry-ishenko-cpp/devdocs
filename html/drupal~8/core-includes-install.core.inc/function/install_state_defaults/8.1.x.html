<h1 id="page-subtitle">function install_state_defaults</h1>     <pre class="signature">install_state_defaults()</pre> <p>Returns an array of default settings for the global installation state.</p> <p>The installation state is initialized with these settings at the beginning of each page request. They may evolve during the page request, but they are initialized again once the next request begins.</p> <p>Non-interactive Drupal installations can override some of these default settings by passing in an array to the installation script, most notably 'parameters' (which contains one-time parameters such as 'profile' and 'langcode' that are normally passed in via the URL) and 'forms' (which can be used to programmatically submit forms during the installation; the keys of each element indicate the name of the installation task that the form submission is for, and the values are used as the $form_state-&gt;getValues() array that is passed on to the form submission via <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal.php/function/drupal-formbuilder/8.1.x.html" title="Returns the form builder service." class="local">\Drupal::formBuilder</a>()-&gt;submitForm()).</p> <h3>See also</h3> <p> <a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-form-formbuilderinterface.php/function/formbuilderinterface-submitform/8.1.x.html" title="Retrieves, populates, and processes a form." class="local">\Drupal\Core\Form\FormBuilderInterface::submitForm</a>()</p>  <h3>File</h3>
