<h1 id="page-subtitle">constant INSTALL_TASK_RUN_IF_NOT_COMPLETED</h1>      <p>Run the task on each installation request until the database is set up.</p> <p>This is the default method for running tasks and should be used for most tasks that occur after the database is set up; these tasks will then run once and be marked complete once they are successfully finished. For example, the Drupal installer uses this flag for the batch installation of modules on the new site, and also for the configuration form that collects basic site information and sets up the site maintenance account.</p>  <h3>File</h3>
