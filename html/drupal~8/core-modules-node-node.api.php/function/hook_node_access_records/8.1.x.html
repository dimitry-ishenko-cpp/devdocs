<h1 id="page-subtitle">function hook_node_access_records</h1>     <pre class="signature">hook_node_access_records(\Drupal\node\NodeInterface $node)</pre> <p>Set permissions for a node to be written to the database.</p> <p>When a node is saved, a module implementing <a href="8.1.x.html" title="Set permissions for a node to be written to the database." class="local active">hook_node_access_records</a>() will be asked if it is interested in the access permissions for a node. If it is interested, it must respond with an array of permissions arrays for that node.</p> <p>Node access grants apply regardless of the published or unpublished status of the node. Implementations must make sure not to grant access to unpublished nodes if they don't want to change the standard access control behavior. Your module may need to create a separate access realm to handle access to unpublished nodes.</p> <p>Note that the grant values in the return value from your hook must be integers and not boolean TRUE and FALSE.</p> <p>Each permissions item in the array is an array with the following elements:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>'realm'</strong>: The name of a realm that the module has defined in <a href="../hook_node_grants/8.1.x.html" title="Inform the node access system what permissions the user has." class="local">hook_node_grants</a>().</li> <li>
<strong>'gid'</strong>: A 'grant ID' from <a href="../hook_node_grants/8.1.x.html" title="Inform the node access system what permissions the user has." class="local">hook_node_grants</a>().</li> <li>
<strong>'grant_view'</strong>: If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member of this gid within this realm can view this node. This should usually be set to $node-&gt;isPublished(). Failure to do so may expose unpublished content to some users.</li> <li>
<strong>'grant_update'</strong>: If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member of this gid within this realm can edit this node.</li> <li>
<strong>'grant_delete'</strong>: If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member of this gid within this realm can delete this node.</li> <li>
<strong>langcode</strong>: (optional) The language code of a specific translation of the node, if any. Modules may add this key to grant different access to different translations of a node, such that (e.g.) a particular group is granted access to edit the Catalan version of the node, but not the Hungarian version. If no value is provided, the langcode is set automatically from the $node parameter and the node's original language (if specified) is used as a fallback. Only specify multiple grant records with different languages for a node if the site has those languages configured.</li> </ul> <p>A "deny all" grant may be used to deny all access to a particular node or node translation:</p> <pre class="php" data-language="php">$grants[] = array(
  'realm' =&gt; 'all',
  'gid' =&gt; 0,
  'grant_view' =&gt; 0,
  'grant_update' =&gt; 0,
  'grant_delete' =&gt; 0,
  'langcode' =&gt; 'ca',
);
</pre>
<p> Note that another module node access module could override this by granting access to one or more nodes, since grants are additive. To enforce that access is denied in a particular case, use <a href="../hook_node_access_records_alter/8.1.x.html" title="Alter permissions for a node before it is written to the database." class="local">hook_node_access_records_alter</a>(). Also note that a deny all is not written to the database; denies are implicit.</p> <h3>Parameters</h3> <p> <strong><a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21node%21src%21NodeInterface.php/interface/NodeInterface/8.1.x" title="Provides an interface defining a node entity." class="local">\Drupal\node\NodeInterface</a> $node</strong>: The node that has just been saved.</p> <h3>Return value</h3> <p> An array of grants as defined above.</p> <h3>See also</h3> <p> <a href="../hook_node_access_records_alter/8.1.x.html" title="Alter permissions for a node before it is written to the database." class="local">hook_node_access_records_alter</a>()</p> <h3>Related topics</h3>   <dl api-related-topics> <dt><a href="../../../core-core.api.php/group/hooks/8.1.x.html">Hooks</a></dt> <dd>Define functions that alter the behavior of Drupal core.</dd> <dt><a href="../../../core-modules-node-node.module/group/node_access/8.1.x.html">Node access rights</a></dt> <dd>The node access system determines who can do what to which nodes.</dd> </dl>    <h3>File</h3>
