  // large number of processes to be blocked waiting for a lock, especially
  // if the item being rebuilt is commonly requested. To address both of these
  // concerns, begin waiting for 25ms, then add 25ms to the wait period each
  // time until it reaches 500ms. After this point polling will continue every
  // 500ms until $delay is reached.

  // microseconds as a parameter. Multiply it by 1 million so that all
