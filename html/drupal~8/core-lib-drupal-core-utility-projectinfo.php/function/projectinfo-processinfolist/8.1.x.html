<h1 id="page-subtitle">function ProjectInfo::processInfoList</h1>     <pre class="signature"><a href="../../class/projectinfo/8.1.x.html">ProjectInfo</a>::processInfoList(array &amp;$projects, array $list, $project_type, $status, array $additional_whitelist = array())</pre> <p>Populates an array of project data.</p> <p>This iterates over a list of the installed modules or themes and groups them by project and status. A few parts of this function assume that enabled modules and themes are always processed first, and if uninstalled modules or themes are being processed (there is a setting to control if uninstalled code should be included in the Available updates report or not),those are only processed after $projects has been populated with information about the enabled code. 'Hidden' modules and themes are ignored if they are not installed. 'Hidden' Modules and themes in the "Testing" package are ignored regardless of installation status.</p> <p>This function also records the latest change time on the .info.yml files for each module or theme, which is important data which is used when deciding if the available update data should be invalidated.</p> <h3>Parameters</h3> <p> <strong>array $projects</strong>: Reference to the array of project data of what's installed on this site.</p> <p><strong><a href="../../../core-lib-drupal-core-extension-extension.php/class/extension/8.1.x.html" title="Defines an extension (file) object." class="local">\Drupal\Core\Extension\Extension</a>[] $list</strong>: Array of data to process to add the relevant info to the $projects array.</p> <p><strong>string $project_type</strong>: The kind of data in the list. Can be 'module' or 'theme'.</p> <p><strong>bool $status</strong>: Boolean that controls what status (enabled or uninstalled) to process out of the $list and add to the $projects array.</p> <p><strong>array $additional_whitelist</strong>: (optional) Array of additional elements to be collected from the .info.yml file.
