<h1 id="page-subtitle">protected property FormState::$temporary</h1>      <p>Holds temporary data accessible during the current page request only.</p> <p>All $form_state properties that are not reserved keys (see other properties marked as uncacheable) persist throughout a multistep form sequence. Form API provides this key for modules to communicate information across form-related functions during a single page request. It may be used to temporarily save data that does not need to or should not be cached during the whole form workflow; e.g., data that needs to be accessed during the current form build process only. There is no use-case for this functionality in Drupal core.</p> <p>This property is uncacheable.</p> <p><strong>Type:</strong> <a href="http://php.net/array" title="array array([mixed $... = ''])
