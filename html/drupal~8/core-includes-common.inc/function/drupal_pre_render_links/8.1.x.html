<h1 id="page-subtitle">function drupal_pre_render_links</h1>     <pre class="signature">drupal_pre_render_links($element)</pre> <p>Pre-render callback: Collects child links into a single array.</p> <p>This function can be added as a pre_render callback for a renderable array, usually one which will be themed by <a href="../../../core-modules-system-templates-links.html.twig/8.1.x.html" title="Default theme implementation for a set of links." class="local">links.html.twig</a>. It iterates through all unrendered children of the element, collects any #links properties it finds, merges them into the parent element's #links array, and prevents those children from being rendered separately.</p> <p>The purpose of this is to allow links to be logically grouped into related categories, so that each child group can be rendered as its own list of links if <a href="../drupal_render/8.1.x.html" title="Renders HTML given a structured array tree." class="local">drupal_render</a>() is called on it, but calling <a href="../drupal_render/8.1.x.html" title="Renders HTML given a structured array tree." class="local">drupal_render</a>() on the parent element will still produce a single list containing all the remaining links, regardless of what group they were in.</p> <p>A typical example comes from node links, which are stored in a renderable array similar to this:</p> <pre class="php" data-language="php">$build['links'] = array(
  '#theme' =&gt; 'links__node',
  '#pre_render' =&gt; array('drupal_pre_render_links'),
  'comment' =&gt; array(
    '#theme' =&gt; 'links__node__comment',
    '#links' =&gt; array(
      // An array of links associated with node comments, suitable for
      // passing in to links.html.twig.
    ),
  ),
  'statistics' =&gt; array(
    '#theme' =&gt; 'links__node__statistics',
    '#links' =&gt; array(
      // An array of links associated with node statistics, suitable for
      // passing in to links.html.twig.
    ),
  ),
  'translation' =&gt; array(
    '#theme' =&gt; 'links__node__translation',
    '#links' =&gt; array(
      // An array of links associated with node translation, suitable for
      // passing in to links.html.twig.
    ),
  ),
);
</pre>
<p> In this example, the links are grouped by functionality, which can be helpful to themers who want to display certain kinds of links independently. For example, adding this code to <a href="../../../core-modules-node-templates-node.html.twig/8.1.x.html" title="Default theme implementation to display a node." class="local">node.html.twig</a> will result in the comment links being rendered as a single list:</p> <pre class="php" data-language="php">{{ content.links.comment }}
</pre>
<p> (where a node's content has been transformed into $content before handing control to the <a href="../../../core-modules-node-templates-node.html.twig/8.1.x.html" title="Default theme implementation to display a node." class="local">node.html.twig</a> template).</p> <p>The pre_render function defined here allows the above flexibility, but also allows the following code to be used to render all remaining links into a single list, regardless of their group:</p> <pre class="php" data-language="php">{{ content.links }}
</pre>
<p> In the above example, this will result in the statistics and translation links being rendered together in a single list (but not the comment links, which were rendered previously on their own).</p> <p>Because of the way this function works, the individual properties of each group (for example, a group-specific #theme property such as 'links__node__comment' in the example above, or any other property such as #attributes or #pre_render that is attached to it) are only used when that group is rendered on its own. When the group is rendered together with other children, these child-specific properties are ignored, and only the overall properties of the parent are used.</p>  <h3>File</h3>
