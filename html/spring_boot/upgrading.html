1. Upgrading From 1.x</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you are upgrading from the <code>1.x</code> release of Spring Boot, check the <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Migration-Guide">“migration guide” on the project wiki</a> that provides detailed upgrade instructions.

2. Upgrading to a New Feature Release</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>When upgrading to a new feature release, some properties may have been renamed or removed. Spring Boot provides a way to analyze your application’s environment and print diagnostics at startup, but also temporarily migrate properties at runtime for you. To enable that feature, add the following dependency to your project:</p> </div> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre class="highlight" data-language="xml"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-properties-migrator&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> <div class="admonitionblock warning"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon">  </td> <td class="content"> Properties that are added late to the environment, such as when using <code>@PropertySource</code>, will not be taken into account. </td> </tr> </table> </div> <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon">  </td> <td class="content"> Once you finish the migration, please make sure to remove this module from your project’s dependencies. </td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="upgrading.cli">
3. Upgrading the Spring Boot CLI</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To upgrade an existing CLI installation, use the appropriate package manager command (for example, <code>brew upgrade</code>). If you manually installed the CLI, follow the <a href="getting-started.html#getting-started.installing.cli.manual-installation">standard instructions</a>, remembering to update your <code>PATH</code> environment variable to remove any older references.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="upgrading.whats-next">
4. What to Read Next</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Once you’ve decided to upgrade your application, you can find detailed information regarding specific features in the rest of the document.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Spring Boot’s documentation is specific to that version, so any information that you find in here will contain the most up-to-date changes that are in that version.</p> </div> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
