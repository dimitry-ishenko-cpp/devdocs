The Deferred object can be in one of three states:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>"pending"</strong>: The Deferred object is not yet in a completed state (neither "rejected" nor "resolved").</li> <li> <strong>"resolved"</strong>: The Deferred object is in the resolved state, meaning that either <a href="deferred.resolve.html"><code>deferred.resolve()</code></a> or <a href="deferred.resolvewith.html"><code>deferred.resolveWith()</code></a> has been called for the object and the doneCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called). </li> <li> <strong>"rejected"</strong>: The Deferred object is in the rejected state, meaning that either <a href="deferred.reject.html"><code>deferred.reject()</code></a> or <a href="deferred.rejectwith.html"><code>deferred.rejectWith()</code></a> has been called for the object and the failCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called).</li> </ul> <p>This method is primarily useful for debugging to determine, for example, whether a Deferred has already been resolved even though you are inside code that intended to reject it.</p> </div> </div></article> </div><div class="_attribution">
