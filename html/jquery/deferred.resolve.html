Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. Each callback is passed the <code>args</code> from the <code>deferred.resolve()</code>. Any doneCallbacks added after the Deferred enters the resolved state are executed immediately when they are added, using the arguments that were passed to the <code>deferred.resolve()</code> call.
