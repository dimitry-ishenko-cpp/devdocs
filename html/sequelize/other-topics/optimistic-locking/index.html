<h1>Optimistic Locking</h1>
<p>Sequelize has built-in support for optimistic locking through a model instance version count.</p> <p>Optimistic locking is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the <code>version</code> property to true in a specific model definition or global model configuration. See <a href="../../core-concepts/model-basics/index.html">model configuration</a> for more details.</p> <p>Optimistic locking allows concurrent access to model records for edits and prevents conflicts from overwriting data. It does this by checking whether another process has made changes to a record since it was read and throws an OptimisticLockError when a conflict is detected.</p><div class="_attribution">
