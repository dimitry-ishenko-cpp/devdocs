<div class="section" id="The-try-Statement">   <h1 class="section">10.9 The try Statement</h1>    <p>The original form of a <code>try</code> block looks like this: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">try
  body
catch
  cleanup
end_try_catch</pre> <p>where <var>body</var> and <var>cleanup</var> are both optional and may contain any Octave expressions or commands. The statements in <var>cleanup</var> are only executed if an error occurs in <var>body</var>. </p> <p>No warnings or error messages are printed while <var>body</var> is executing. If an error does occur during the execution of <var>body</var>, <var>cleanup</var> can use the functions <code>lasterr</code> or <code>lasterror</code> to access the text of the message that would have been printed, as well as its identifier. The alternative form, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">try
  body
catch err
  cleanup
end_try_catch</pre> <p>will automatically store the output of <code>lasterror</code> in the structure <var>err</var>. See <a href="errors-and-warnings.html">Errors and Warnings</a>, for more information about the <code>lasterr</code> and <code>lasterror</code> functions. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
