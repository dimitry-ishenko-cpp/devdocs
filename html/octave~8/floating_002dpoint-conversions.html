<div class="subsection" id="Floating_002dPoint-Conversions">   <h1 class="subsection">14.2.9 Floating-Point Conversions</h1> <p>This section discusses the conversion specifications for floating-point numbers: the ‘<samp>%f</samp>’, ‘<samp>%e</samp>’, ‘<samp>%E</samp>’, ‘<samp>%g</samp>’, and ‘<samp>%G</samp>’ conversions. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%f</samp>’ conversion prints its argument in fixed-point notation, producing output of the form [<code><span class="nolinebreak">-</span></code>]<var>ddd</var><code>.</code><var>ddd</var>, where the number of digits following the decimal point is controlled by the precision you specify. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%e</samp>’ conversion prints its argument in exponential notation, producing output of the form [<code><span class="nolinebreak">-</span></code>]<var>d</var><code>.</code><var>ddd</var><code>e</code>[<code>+</code>|<code><span class="nolinebreak">-</span></code>]<var>dd</var>. Again, the number of digits following the decimal point is controlled by the precision. The exponent always contains at least two digits. The ‘<samp>%E</samp>’ conversion is similar but the exponent is marked with the letter ‘<samp>E</samp>’ instead of ‘<samp>e</samp>’. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%g</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%G</samp>’ conversions print the argument in the style of ‘<samp>%e</samp>’ or ‘<samp>%E</samp>’ (respectively) if the exponent would be less than -4 or greater than or equal to the precision; otherwise they use the ‘<samp>%f</samp>’ style. Trailing zeros are removed from the fractional portion of the result and a decimal-point character appears only if it is followed by a digit. </p> <p>The following flags can be used to modify the behavior: </p> <dl compact> <dt><span>‘<samp>-</samp>’</span></dt> <dd>
<p>Left-justify the result in the field. Normally the result is right-justified. </p> </dd> <dt><span>‘<samp>+</samp>’</span></dt> <dd>
<p>Always include a plus or minus sign in the result. </p> </dd> <dt><span>‘’</span></dt> <dd>
<p>If the result doesn’t start with a plus or minus sign, prefix it with a space instead. Since the ‘<samp>+</samp>’ flag ensures that the result includes a sign, this flag is ignored if you supply both of them. </p> </dd> <dt><span>‘<samp>#</samp>’</span></dt> <dd>
<p>Specifies that the result should always include a decimal point, even if no digits follow it. For the ‘<samp>%g</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%G</samp>’ conversions, this also forces trailing zeros after the decimal point to be left in place where they would otherwise be removed. </p> </dd> <dt><span>‘<samp>0</samp>’</span></dt> <dd><p>Pad the field with zeros instead of spaces; the zeros are placed after any sign. This flag is ignored if the ‘<samp>-</samp>’ flag is also specified. </p></dd> </dl> <p>The precision specifies how many digits follow the decimal-point character for the ‘<samp>%f</samp>’, ‘<samp>%e</samp>’, and ‘<samp>%E</samp>’ conversions. For these conversions, the default precision is <code>6</code>. If the precision is explicitly <code>0</code>, this suppresses the decimal point character entirely. For the ‘<samp>%g</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%G</samp>’ conversions, the precision specifies how many significant digits to print. Significant digits are the first digit before the decimal point, and all the digits after it. If the precision is <code>0</code> or not specified for ‘<samp>%g</samp>’ or ‘<samp>%G</samp>’, it is treated like a value of <code>1</code>. If the value being printed cannot be expressed precisely in the specified number of digits, the value is rounded to the nearest number that fits. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
