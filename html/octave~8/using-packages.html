<div class="section" id="Using-Packages">   <h1 class="section">37.2 Using Packages</h1> <p>By default installed packages are not available from the Octave prompt, but it is possible to control this using the <code>pkg load</code> and <code>pkg unload</code> commands. The functions from a package can be added to the Octave path by typing </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg load package_name</pre> <p>where <code>package_name</code> is the name of the package to be added to the path. </p> <p>In much the same way a package can be removed from the Octave path by typing </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg unload package_name</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
