<div class="section" id="Function-Support">   <h1 class="section">21.3 Functions That Are Aware of These Matrices</h1> <p>This section lists the built-in functions that are aware of diagonal and permutation matrices on input, or can return them as output. Passed to other functions, these matrices will in general trigger an implicit conversion. (Of course, user-defined dynamically linked functions may also work with diagonal or permutation matrices). </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="diagonal-matrix-functions.html" accesskey="1">Diagonal Matrix Functions</a></li> <li><a href="permutation-matrix-functions.html" accesskey="2">Permutation Matrix Functions</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
