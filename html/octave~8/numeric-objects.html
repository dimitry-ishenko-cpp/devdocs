<div class="subsection" id="Numeric-Objects">   <h1 class="subsection">3.1.1 Numeric Objects</h1>   <p>Octave’s built-in numeric objects include real, complex, and integer scalars and matrices. All built-in floating point numeric data is currently stored as double precision numbers. On systems that use the IEEE floating point format, values in the range of approximately 2.2251e-308 to 1.7977e+308 can be stored, and the relative precision is approximately 2.2204e-16. The exact values are given by the variables <code>realmin</code>, <code>realmax</code>, and <code>eps</code>, respectively. </p> <p>Matrix objects can be of any size, and can be dynamically reshaped and resized. It is easy to extract individual rows, columns, or submatrices using a variety of powerful indexing features. See <a href="index-expressions.html">Index Expressions</a>. </p> <p>See <a href="numeric-data-types.html">Numeric Data Types</a>, for more information. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
