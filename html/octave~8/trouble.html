<div class="appendix" id="Trouble">   <h1 class="appendix">Appendix D Known Causes of Trouble</h1>     <p>This section describes known problems that affect users of Octave. Most of these are not Octave bugs per se—if they were, we would fix them. But the result for a user may be like the result of a bug. </p> <p>Some of these problems are due to bugs in other software, some are missing features that are too much work to add, and some are places where people’s opinions differ as to what is best. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="actual-bugs.html" accesskey="1">Actual Bugs We Haven’t Fixed Yet</a></li> <li><a href="reporting-bugs.html" accesskey="2">Reporting Bugs</a></li> <li><a href="how-to-get-help-with-octave.html" accesskey="3">How To Get Help with Octave</a></li> <li><a href="how-to-distinguish-between-octave-and-matlab.html" accesskey="4">How to Distinguish Between Octave and Matlab</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
