<div class="section" id="Administrating-Packages">   <h1 class="section">37.3 Administrating Packages</h1> <p>It is possible to make both per-user (local) and system-wide (global) installations of a package. If the user performing the installation is <code>root</code> (or Administrator with elevated privileges on Windows), the packages by default install in a system-wide directory that defaults to <samp><var>OCTAVE_HOME</var>/share/octave/packages/</samp>. If the user is not <code>root</code> (or Octave is running without elevated privileges), packages are installed locally. The default installation directory for local packages is <samp><var>user_data_dir</var>/octave/<var>OCTAVE_API_VERSION</var>/packages</samp>. Packages will be installed in a subdirectory of the installation directory that will be named after the package. It is possible to change the installation directory by using the <code>pkg prefix</code> command: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg prefix new_installation_directory</pre> <p>The current installation directory can be retrieved by typing </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">current_installation_directory = pkg ("prefix")</pre> <p>The package manager stores some information about the installed packages in configuration files. For per-user (local) packages, this information is stored in the file <samp><var>user_config_dir</var>/octave/<var>OCTAVE_API_VERSION</var>/octave_packages</samp> by default. For system-wide (global) installations, it is stored in <samp><var>OCTAVE_HOME</var>/share/octave/octave_packages</samp>. The path to the per-user file can be changed with the <code>pkg local_list</code> command: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg local_list /path/to/new_file</pre> <p>For system-wide installations, this can be changed in the same way using the <code>pkg global_list</code> command. If these commands are called without a new path, the current path will be returned. To retain these settings between sessions, they can be set in one of the startup files, see <a href="startup-files.html">Startup Files</a>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
