<div class="section" id="Command-Syntax-and-Function-Syntax">   <h1 class="section">11.13 Command Syntax and Function Syntax</h1>  <p>In addition to the function syntax described above (i.e., calling a function like <code>fun (arg1, arg2, …)</code>), a function can be called using command syntax (for example, calling a function like <code>fun arg1 arg2 …</code>). In that case, all arguments are passed to the function as strings. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">my_command hello world</pre> <p>is equivalent to </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">my_command ("hello", "world")</pre> <p>The general form of a command call is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">cmdname arg1 arg2 …</pre> <p>which translates directly to </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">cmdname ("arg1", "arg2", …)</pre> <p>If an argument including spaces should be passed to a function in command syntax, (double-)quotes can be used. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">my_command "first argument" "second argument"</pre> <p>is equivalent to </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">my_command ("first argument", "second argument")</pre> <p>Any function can be used as a command if it accepts string input arguments. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">toupper lower_case_arg
   ⇒ ans = LOWER_CASE_ARG</pre> <p>Since the arguments are passed as strings to the corresponding function, it is not possible to pass input arguments that are stored in variables. In that case, a command must be called using the function syntax. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">strvar = "hello world";
toupper strvar
   ⇒ ans = STRVAR
toupper (strvar)
   ⇒ ans = HELLO WORLD</pre> <p>Additionally, the return values of functions cannot be assigned to variables using the command syntax. Only the first return argument is assigned to the built-in variable <code>ans</code>. If the output argument of a command should be assigned to a variable, or multiple output arguments of a function should be returned, the function syntax must be used. </p> <p>It should be noted that mixing command syntax and binary operators can create apparent ambiguities with mathematical and logical expressions that use function syntax. For example, all three of the statements </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">arg1 - arg2
arg1 -arg2
arg1-arg2</pre> <p>could be intended by a user to be subtraction operations between <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code>. The first two, however, could also have been meant as a command syntax call to function <code>arg1</code>, in the first case with options <code>-</code> and <code>arg2</code>, and in the second case with option <code>-arg2</code>. </p> <p>Octave uses whitespace to interpret such expressions according to the following rules: </p> <ul> <li> Statements consisting of plain symbols without any operators that are separated only by whitespace are always treated as command syntax: <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">arg1 arg2 arg3 ... argn</pre> </li>
<li> Statements without any whitespace are always treated as function syntax: <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">arg1+arg2
arg1&amp;&amp;arg2||arg3
arg1+=arg2*arg3</pre> </li>
<li> If the first symbol is a constant (or special-valued named constant pi, i, I, j, J, e, NaN, or Inf) followed by a binary operator, the statement is treated as function syntax regardless of any whitespace or what follows the second symbol: <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">7 -arg2
pi+ arg2
j * arg2 -arg3</pre> </li>
<li> If the first symbol is a function or variable and there is no whitespace separating the operator and the second symbol, the statement is treated as command syntax: <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">arg1 -arg2
arg1 &amp;&amp;arg2 ||arg3
arg1 +=arg2*arg3</pre> </li>
<li> Any other whitespace combination will result in the statement being treated as function syntax. </li>
</ul> <p>Note 1: If a special-valued named constant has been redefined as a variable, the interpreter will still process the statement with function syntax. </p> <p>Note 2: Attempting to use a variable as <code>arg1</code> in a command being processed as command syntax will result in an error. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
