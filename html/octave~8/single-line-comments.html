<div class="subsection" id="Single-Line-Comments">   <h1 class="subsection">2.7.1 Single Line Comments</h1>   <p>In the Octave language, a comment starts with either the sharp sign character, ‘<samp>#</samp>’, or the percent symbol ‘<samp>%</samp>’ and continues to the end of the line. Any text following the sharp sign or percent symbol is ignored by the Octave interpreter and not executed. The following example shows whole line and partial line comments. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function countdown
  # Count down for main rocket engines
  disp (3);
  disp (2);
  disp (1);
  disp ("Blast Off!");  # Rocket leaves pad
