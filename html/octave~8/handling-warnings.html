<div class="section" id="Handling-Warnings">   <h1 class="section">12.2 Handling Warnings</h1> <p>Like an error, a warning is issued when something unexpected happens. Unlike an error, a warning doesn’t abort the currently running program. A simple example of a warning is when a number is divided by zero. In this case Octave will issue a warning and assign the value <code>Inf</code> to the result. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = 1/0
     -| warning: division by zero
     ⇒ a = Inf</pre> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="issuing-warnings.html" accesskey="1">Issuing Warnings</a></li> <li><a href="enabling-and-disabling-warnings.html" accesskey="2">Enabling and Disabling Warnings</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
