<div class="section" id="String-Operations">   <h1 class="section">5.3 String Operations</h1> <p>Octave supports a wide range of functions for manipulating strings. Since a string is just a matrix, simple manipulations can be accomplished using standard operators. The following example shows how to replace all blank characters with underscores. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">quote = ...
  "First things first, but not necessarily in that order";
quote( quote == " " ) = "_"
⇒ quote =
    First_things_first,_but_not_necessarily_in_that_order</pre> <p>For more complex manipulations, such as searching, replacing, and general regular expressions, the following functions come with Octave. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="common-string-operations.html" accesskey="1">Common String Operations</a></li> <li><a href="concatenating-strings.html" accesskey="2">Concatenating Strings</a></li> <li><a href="splitting-and-joining-strings.html" accesskey="3">Splitting and Joining Strings</a></li> <li><a href="searching-in-strings.html" accesskey="4">Searching in Strings</a></li> <li><a href="searching-and-replacing-in-strings.html" accesskey="5">Searching and Replacing in Strings</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
