One way to avoid this is to force pending output to be flushed before calling a function that will produce output from within Fortran functions. To do this, use the command <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">fflush (stdout)</pre> <p>Another possible workaround is to use the command </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">page_screen_output (false);</pre> <p>to turn the pager off. </p>
