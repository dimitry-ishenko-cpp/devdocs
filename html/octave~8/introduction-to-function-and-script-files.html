<div class="section" id="Introduction-to-Function-and-Script-Files">   <h1 class="section">11.1 Introduction to Function and Script Files</h1> <p>There are seven different things covered in this section. </p>
<ol> <li> Typing in a function at the command prompt. </li>
<li> Storing a group of commands in a file — called a script file. </li>
<li> Storing a function in a file—called a function file. </li>
<li> Subfunctions in function files. </li>
<li> Multiple functions in one script file. </li>
<li> Private functions. </li>
<li> Nested functions. </li>
</ol> <p>Both function files and script files end with an extension of .m, for <small>MATLAB</small> compatibility. If you want more than one independent functions in a file, it must be a script file (see <a href="script-files.html">Script Files</a>), and to use these functions you must execute the script file before you can use the functions that are in the script file. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
