<div class="subsection" id="Evaluation-Notation">   <h1 class="subsection">1.3.2 Evaluation Notation</h1>   <p>In the examples in this manual, results from expressions that you evaluate are indicated with ‘<samp>⇒</samp>’. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">sqrt (2)
     ⇒ 1.4142</pre> <p>You can read this as “<code>sqrt (2)</code> evaluates to 1.4142”. </p> <p>In some cases, matrix values that are returned by expressions are displayed like this </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[1, 2; 3, 4] == [1, 3; 2, 4]
     ⇒ [ 1, 0; 0, 1 ]</pre> <p>and in other cases, they are displayed like this </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">eye (3)
     ⇒  1  0  0
         0  1  0
         0  0  1</pre> <p>in order to clearly show the structure of the result. </p> <p>Sometimes to help describe one expression, another expression is shown that produces identical results. The exact equivalence of expressions is indicated with ‘<samp>≡</samp>’. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1)
≡
rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], 3)
≡
rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], 7)</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
