<div class="section" id="Running-Octave">   <h1 class="section">1.1 Running Octave</h1> <p>On most systems, Octave is started with the shell command ‘<samp>octave</samp>’. This starts the graphical user interface. The central window in the GUI is the Octave command-line interface. In this window Octave displays an initial message and then a prompt indicating it is ready to accept input. If you have chosen the traditional command-line interface then only the command prompt appears in the same window that was running a shell. In either case, you can immediately begin typing Octave commands. </p> <p>If you get into trouble, you can usually interrupt Octave by typing <kbd>Control-C</kbd> (written <kbd>C-c</kbd> for short). <kbd>C-c</kbd> gets its name from the fact that you type it by holding down <tt class="key">CTRL</tt> and then pressing <tt class="key">c</tt>. Doing this will normally return you to Octave’s prompt. </p>   <p>To exit Octave, type <kbd>quit</kbd> or <kbd>exit</kbd> at the Octave prompt. </p> <p>On systems that support job control, you can suspend Octave by sending it a <code>SIGTSTP</code> signal, usually by typing <kbd>C-z</kbd>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
