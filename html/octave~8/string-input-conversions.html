<div class="subsection" id="String-Input-Conversions">   <h1 class="subsection">14.2.15 String Input Conversions</h1> <p>This section describes the <code>scanf</code> input conversions for reading string and character values: ‘<samp>%s</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%c</samp>’. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%c</samp>’ conversion is the simplest: it matches a fixed number of characters, always. The maximum field with says how many characters to read; if you don’t specify the maximum, the default is 1. This conversion does not skip over initial whitespace characters. It reads precisely the next <var>n</var> characters, and fails if it cannot get that many. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%s</samp>’ conversion matches a string of non-whitespace characters. It skips and discards initial whitespace, but stops when it encounters more whitespace after having read something. </p> <p>For example, reading the input: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">hello, world</pre> <p>with the conversion ‘<samp>%10c</samp>’ produces <code>" hello, wo"</code>, but reading the same input with the conversion ‘<samp>%10s</samp>’ produces <code>"hello,"</code>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
