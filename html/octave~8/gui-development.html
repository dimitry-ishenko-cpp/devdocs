<div class="chapter" id="GUI-Development">   <h1 class="chapter">35 GUI Development</h1> <p>Octave is principally a batch or command-line language. However, it does offer some features for constructing graphical interfaces that interact with users. </p> <p>The GUI elements available are I/O dialogs, a progress bar, and UI elements for plot windows. For example, rather than hardcoding a filename for output results a script can open a dialog box and allow the user to choose a file. Similarly, if a calculation is expected to take a long time a script can display a progress bar. The various UI elements can be used to fully customize the plot window with menubars, toolbars, context menus, pushbuttons, sliders, etc. </p> <p>Several utility functions make it possible to store private data for use with a GUI which will not pollute the user’s variable space. </p> <p>Finally, a program written in Octave might want to have long term storage of preferences or state variables. This can be done with user-defined preferences. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="i_002fo-dialogs.html" accesskey="1">I/O Dialogs</a></li> <li><a href="progress-bar.html" accesskey="2">Progress Bar</a></li> <li><a href="ui-elements.html" accesskey="3">UI Elements</a></li> <li><a href="gui-utility-functions.html" accesskey="4">GUI Utility Functions</a></li> <li><a href="user_002ddefined-preferences.html" accesskey="5">User-Defined Preferences</a></li> <li><a href="octave-workspace-windows.html" accesskey="6">Octave Workspace Windows</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
