However, in that case great care must be taken to avoid memory leaks. The preferred manner in which to allocate memory for use locally is to use the <code><span class="nolinebreak">OCTAVE_LOCAL_BUFFER</span></code> macro. An example of its use is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">OCTAVE_LOCAL_BUFFER (double, tmp, len)</pre> <p>that returns a pointer <code>tmp</code> of type <code>double *</code> of length <code>len</code>. </p> <p>In this case, Octave itself will worry about reference counting and variable scope and will properly free memory without programmer intervention. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
