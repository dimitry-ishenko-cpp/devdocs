<div class="subsection" id="Function-Precedence">   <h1 class="subsection">11.10.7 Function Precedence</h1> <p>Given the numerous different ways that Octave can define a function, it is possible and even likely that multiple versions of a function, might be defined within a particular scope. The precedence of which function will be used within a particular scope is given by </p> <ol> <li> Subfunction A subfunction with the required function name in the given scope. </li>
<li> Private function A function defined within a private directory of the directory which contains the current function. </li>
<li> Class constructor A function that constructs a user class as defined in chapter <a href="object-oriented-programming.html">Object Oriented Programming</a>. </li>
<li> Class method An overloaded function of a class as in chapter <a href="object-oriented-programming.html">Object Oriented Programming</a>. </li>
<li> Command-line Function A function that has been defined on the command-line. </li>
<li> Autoload function A function that is marked as autoloaded with See <a href="overloading-and-autoloading.html#XREFautoload">autoload</a>. </li>
<li> A Function on the Path A function that can be found on the users load-path. There can also be Oct-file, mex-file or m-file versions of this function and the precedence between these versions are in that order. </li>
<li> Built-in function A function that is a part of core Octave such as <code>numel</code>, <code>size</code>, etc. </li>
