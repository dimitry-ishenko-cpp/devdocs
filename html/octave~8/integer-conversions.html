<div class="subsection" id="Integer-Conversions">   <h1 class="subsection">14.2.8 Integer Conversions</h1> <p>This section describes the options for the ‘<samp>%d</samp>’, ‘<samp>%i</samp>’, ‘<samp>%o</samp>’, ‘<samp>%u</samp>’, ‘<samp>%x</samp>’, and ‘<samp>%X</samp>’ conversion specifications. These conversions print integers in various formats. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%d</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%i</samp>’ conversion specifications both print an numeric argument as a signed decimal number; while ‘<samp>%o</samp>’, ‘<samp>%u</samp>’, and ‘<samp>%x</samp>’ print the argument as an unsigned octal, decimal, or hexadecimal number (respectively). The ‘<samp>%X</samp>’ conversion specification is just like ‘<samp>%x</samp>’ except that it uses the characters ‘<samp>ABCDEF</samp>’ as digits instead of ‘<samp>abcdef</samp>’. </p> <p>The following flags are meaningful: </p> <dl compact> <dt><span>‘<samp>-</samp>’</span></dt> <dd>
<p>Left-justify the result in the field (instead of the normal right-justification). </p> </dd> <dt><span>‘<samp>+</samp>’</span></dt> <dd>
<p>For the signed ‘<samp>%d</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%i</samp>’ conversions, print a plus sign if the value is positive. </p> </dd> <dt><span>‘’</span></dt> <dd>
<p>For the signed ‘<samp>%d</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%i</samp>’ conversions, if the result doesn’t start with a plus or minus sign, prefix it with a space character instead. Since the ‘<samp>+</samp>’ flag ensures that the result includes a sign, this flag is ignored if you supply both of them. </p> </dd> <dt><span>‘<samp>#</samp>’</span></dt> <dd>
<p>For the ‘<samp>%o</samp>’ conversion, this forces the leading digit to be ‘<samp>0</samp>’, as if by increasing the precision. For ‘<samp>%x</samp>’ or ‘<samp>%X</samp>’, this prefixes a leading ‘<samp>0x</samp>’ or ‘<samp>0X</samp>’ (respectively) to the result. This doesn’t do anything useful for the ‘<samp>%d</samp>’, ‘<samp>%i</samp>’, or ‘<samp>%u</samp>’ conversions. </p> </dd> <dt><span>‘<samp>0</samp>’</span></dt> <dd><p>Pad the field with zeros instead of spaces. The zeros are placed after any indication of sign or base. This flag is ignored if the ‘<samp>-</samp>’ flag is also specified, or if a precision is specified. </p></dd> </dl> <p>If a precision is supplied, it specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; leading zeros are produced if necessary. If you don’t specify a precision, the number is printed with as many digits as it needs. If you convert a value of zero with an explicit precision of zero, then no characters at all are produced. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
