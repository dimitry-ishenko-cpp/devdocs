<div class="subsection" id="Sparse-Matrices-in-Oct_002dFiles">   <h1 class="subsection">A.1.6 Sparse Matrices in Oct-Files</h1> <p>There are three classes of sparse objects that are of interest to the user. </p> <dl compact> <dt><span><code>SparseMatrix</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>A double precision sparse matrix class </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>SparseComplexMatrix</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>A complex sparse matrix class </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>SparseBoolMatrix</code></span></dt> <dd><p>A boolean sparse matrix class </p></dd> </dl> <p>All of these classes inherit from the <code>Sparse&lt;T&gt;</code> template class, and so all have similar capabilities and usage. The <code>Sparse&lt;T&gt;</code> class was based on Octave’s <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code> class and users familiar with Octave’s <code>Array</code> classes will be comfortable with the use of the sparse classes. </p> <p>The sparse classes will not be entirely described in this section, due to their similarity with the existing <code>Array</code> classes. However, there are a few differences due the nature of sparse objects, and these will be described. First, although it is fundamentally possible to have N-dimensional sparse objects, the Octave sparse classes do not allow them at this time; All instances of the sparse classes <strong>must</strong> be 2-dimensional. This means that <code>SparseMatrix</code> is actually more similar to Octave’s <code>Matrix</code> class than it is to the <code>NDArray</code> class. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="array-and-sparse-class-differences.html" accesskey="1">Array and Sparse Class Differences</a></li> <li><a href="creating-sparse-matrices-in-oct_002dfiles.html" accesskey="2">Creating Sparse Matrices in Oct-Files</a></li> <li><a href="using-sparse-matrices-in-oct_002dfiles.html" accesskey="3">Using Sparse Matrices in Oct-Files</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
