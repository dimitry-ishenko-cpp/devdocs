<div class="subsubsection" id="Hardware-vs-Software-Rendering">   <h1 class="subsubsection">15.4.8.2 Hardware vs Software Rendering</h1>  <p>When using the Octave for Windows installer, the user has the option to select between "System OpenGL" and "Software OpenGL" renderers. This option selects whether software rendering is used for the OpenGL graphics toolkits (<code>"qt"</code> and <code>"fltk"</code>). Software rendering can be used to avoid rendering and printing issues due to imperfect OpenGL driver implementations for diverse graphic cards from different vendors (notably integrated Intel graphics). As a down-side, software rendering might be considerably slower than hardware accelerated rendering (and it might not work correctly on 32-bit platforms or WoW64). To permanently switch between hardware accelerated rendering with your graphics card drivers and software rendering, use the "OpenGL Switcher" application from the Start menu while Octave is closed. Alternatively, rename the following file while Octave is closed: </p> <p><samp><var>octave-home</var>\bin\opengl32.dll</samp> <br>where <var>octave-home</var> is the directory returned by <a href="system-information.html#XREFOCTAVE_005fHOME"><code><span class="nolinebreak">OCTAVE_HOME</span></code></a>, i.e., the directory in which Octave is installed (the default is <samp>C:\Program Files\GNU Octave\Octave\Octave-<var>version</var>\mingw64</samp>). Change the file extension to <samp>.bak</samp> for hardware rendering or to <samp>.dll</samp> for software rendering. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
