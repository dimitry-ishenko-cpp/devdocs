<div class="section" id="Invoking-Octave-from-the-Command-Line">   <h1 class="section">2.1 Invoking Octave from the Command Line</h1> <p>Normally, Octave is used interactively by running the program ‘<samp>octave</samp>’ without any arguments. Once started, Octave reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit. </p> <p>You can also specify the name of a file on the command line, and Octave will read and execute the commands from the named file and then exit when it is finished. </p> <p>You can further control how Octave starts by using the command-line options described in the next section, and Octave itself can remind you of the options available. Type ‘<samp>octave --help</samp>’ to display all available options and briefly describe their use (‘<samp>octave -h</samp>’ is a shorter equivalent). </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="command-line-options.html" accesskey="1">Command Line Options</a></li> <li><a href="startup-files.html" accesskey="2">Startup Files</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
