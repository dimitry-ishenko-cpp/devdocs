<div class="section" id="Mex_002dFiles">   <h1 class="section">A.2 Mex-Files</h1>   <p>Octave includes an interface to allow legacy mex-files to be compiled and used with Octave. This interface can also be used to share compiled code between Octave and <small>MATLAB</small> users. However, as mex-files expose <small>MATLAB</small>’s internal API, and the internal structure of Octave is different, a mex-file can never have the same performance in Octave as the equivalent oct-file. In particular, to support the manner in which variables are passed to mex functions there are a significant number of additional copies of memory blocks when invoking or returning from a mex-file function. For this reason, it is recommended that any new code be written with the oct-file interface previously discussed. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="getting-started-with-mex_002dfiles.html" accesskey="1">Getting Started with Mex-Files</a></li> <li><a href="working-with-matrices-and-arrays-in-mex_002dfiles.html" accesskey="2">Working with Matrices and Arrays in Mex-Files</a></li> <li><a href="character-strings-in-mex_002dfiles.html" accesskey="3">Character Strings in Mex-Files</a></li> <li><a href="cell-arrays-with-mex_002dfiles.html" accesskey="4">Cell Arrays with Mex-Files</a></li> <li><a href="structures-with-mex_002dfiles.html" accesskey="5">Structures with Mex-Files</a></li> <li><a href="sparse-matrices-with-mex_002dfiles.html" accesskey="6">Sparse Matrices with Mex-Files</a></li> <li><a href="calling-other-functions-in-mex_002dfiles.html" accesskey="7">Calling Other Functions in Mex-Files</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
