<div class="chapter" id="Data-Containers">   <h1 class="chapter">6 Data Containers</h1>  <p>Octave includes support for three different mechanisms to contain arbitrary data types in the same variable: Structures, which are C-like, and are indexed with named fields; containers.Map objects, which store data in key/value pairs; and cell arrays, where each element of the array can have a different data type and or shape. Multiple input arguments and return values of functions are organized as another data container, the comma-separated list. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="structures.html" accesskey="1">Structures</a></li> <li><a href="containers_002emap.html" accesskey="2">containers.Map</a></li> <li><a href="cell-arrays.html" accesskey="3">Cell Arrays</a></li> <li><a href="comma_002dseparated-lists.html" accesskey="4">Comma-Separated Lists</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
