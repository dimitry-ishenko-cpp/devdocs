<div class="subsection" id="Creating-Diagonal-Matrices">   <h1 class="subsection">21.1.1 Creating Diagonal Matrices</h1> <p>The most common and easiest way to create a diagonal matrix is using the built-in function <em>diag</em>. The expression <code>diag (v)</code>, with <var>v</var> a vector, will create a square diagonal matrix with elements on the main diagonal given by the elements of <var>v</var>, and size equal to the length of <var>v</var>. <code>diag (v, m, n)</code> can be used to construct a rectangular diagonal matrix. The result of these expressions will be a special diagonal matrix object, rather than a general matrix object. </p> <p>Diagonal matrix with unit elements can be created using <em>eye</em>. Some other built-in functions can also return diagonal matrices. Examples include <em>balance</em> or <em>inv</em>. </p> <p>Example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">diag (1:4)
