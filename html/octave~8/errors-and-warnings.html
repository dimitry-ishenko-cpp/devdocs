<div class="chapter" id="Errors-and-Warnings">   <h1 class="chapter">12 Errors and Warnings</h1> <p>Octave includes several functions for printing error and warning messages. When you write functions that need to take special action when they encounter abnormal conditions, you should print the error messages using the functions described in this chapter. </p> <p>Since many of Octave’s functions use these functions, it is also useful to understand them, so that errors and warnings can be handled. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="handling-errors.html" accesskey="1">Handling Errors</a></li> <li><a href="handling-warnings.html" accesskey="2">Handling Warnings</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
