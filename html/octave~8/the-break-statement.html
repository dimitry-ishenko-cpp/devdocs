<div class="section" id="The-break-Statement">   <h1 class="section">10.6 The break Statement</h1>  <p>The <code>break</code> statement jumps out of the innermost <code>while</code>, <code>do-until</code>, or <code>for</code> loop that encloses it. The <code>break</code> statement may only be used within the body of a loop. The following example finds the smallest divisor of a given integer, and also identifies prime numbers: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">num = 103;
div = 2;
while (div*div &lt;= num)
  if (rem (num, div) == 0)
    break;
  endif
  div++;
endwhile
if (rem (num, div) == 0)
  printf ("Smallest divisor of %d is %d\n", num, div)
else
  printf ("%d is prime\n", num);
endif</pre> <p>When the remainder is zero in the first <code>while</code> statement, Octave immediately <em>breaks out</em> of the loop. This means that Octave proceeds immediately to the statement following the loop and continues processing. (This is very different from the <code>exit</code> statement which stops the entire Octave program.) </p> <p>Here is another program equivalent to the previous one. It illustrates how the <var>condition</var> of a <code>while</code> statement could just as well be replaced with a <code>break</code> inside an <code>if</code>: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">num = 103;
div = 2;
while (1)
  if (rem (num, div) == 0)
    printf ("Smallest divisor of %d is %d\n", num, div);
    break;
  endif
  div++;
  if (div*div &gt; num)
    printf ("%d is prime\n", num);
    break;
  endif
endwhile</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
