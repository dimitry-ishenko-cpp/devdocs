<div class="subsection" id="Comma_002dSeparated-Lists-Generated-from-Cell-Arrays">   <h1 class="subsection">6.4.1 Comma-Separated Lists Generated from Cell Arrays</h1> <p>As has been mentioned above (see <a href="indexing-cell-arrays.html">Indexing Cell Arrays</a>), elements of a cell array can be extracted into a comma-separated list with the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> operators. By surrounding this list with <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>, it can be concatenated into an array. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = {1, [2, 3], 4, 5, 6};
b = [a{1:4}]
     ⇒ b =
         1   2   3   4   5</pre> <p>Similarly, it is possible to create a new cell array containing cell elements selected with <code>{}</code>. By surrounding the list with ‘<samp>{</samp>’ and ‘<samp>}</samp>’ a new cell array will be created, as the following example illustrates: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = {1, rand(2, 2), "three"};
b = { a{ [1, 3] } }
     ⇒ b =
         {
           [1,1] =  1
           [1,2] = three
         }</pre> <p>Furthermore, cell elements (accessed by <code>{}</code>) can be passed directly to a function. The list of elements from the cell array will be passed as an argument list to a given function as if it is called with the elements as individual arguments. The two calls to <code>printf</code> in the following example are identical but the latter is simpler and can handle cell arrays of an arbitrary size: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">c = {"GNU", "Octave", "is", "Free", "Software"};
printf ("%s ", c{1}, c{2}, c{3}, c{4}, c{5});
     -| GNU Octave is Free Software
printf ("%s ", c{:});
     -| GNU Octave is Free Software</pre> <p>If used on the left-hand side of an assignment, a comma-separated list generated with <code>{}</code> can be assigned to. An example is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">in{1} = [10, 20, 30];
in{2} = inf;
in{3} = "last";
in{4} = "first";
out = cell (4, 1);
[out{1:3}] = in{1 : 3};
[out{4:6}] = in{[1, 2, 4]})
     ⇒ out =
        {
           [1,1] =

              10   20   30

           [2,1] = Inf
           [3,1] = last
           [4,1] =

              10   20   30

           [5,1] = Inf
           [6,1] = first
        }</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
