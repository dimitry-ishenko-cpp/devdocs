<div class="subsection" id="Block-Comments">   <h1 class="subsection">2.7.2 Block Comments</h1>     <p>Entire blocks of code can be commented by enclosing the code between matching ‘<samp>#{</samp>’ and ‘<samp>#}</samp>’ or ‘<samp>%{</samp>’ and ‘<samp>%}</samp>’ markers. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function quick_countdown
  # Count down for main rocket engines
  disp (3);
 #{
  disp (2);
  disp (1);
 #}
  disp ("Blast Off!");  # Rocket leaves pad
endfunction</pre> <p>will produce a very quick countdown from <code>'3'</code> to <code>"Blast Off"</code> as the lines "<code>disp (2);</code>" and "<code>disp (1);</code>" won’t be executed. </p> <p>The block comment markers must appear alone as the only characters on a line (excepting whitespace) in order to be parsed correctly. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
