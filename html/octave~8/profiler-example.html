<div class="section" id="Profiler-Example">   <h1 class="section">13.7 Profiler Example</h1> <p>Below, we will give a short example of a profiler session. See <a href="profiling.html">Profiling</a>, for the documentation of the profiler functions in detail. Consider the code: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">global N A;

N = 300;
A = rand (N, N);

function xt = timesteps (steps, x0, expM)
  global N;

  if (steps == 0)
    xt = NA (N, 0);
  else
    xt = NA (N, steps);
    x1 = expM * x0;
    xt(:, 1) = x1;
    xt(:, 2 : end) = timesteps (steps - 1, x1, expM);
  endif
endfunction

function foo ()
  global N A;

  initial = @(x) sin (x);
  x0 = (initial (linspace (0, 2 * pi, N)))';

  expA = expm (A);
  xt = timesteps (100, x0, expA);
endfunction

function fib = bar (N)
  if (N &lt;= 2)
    fib = 1;
  else
    fib = bar (N - 1) + bar (N - 2);
  endif
endfunction</pre> <p>If we execute the two main functions, we get: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">tic; foo; toc;
⇒ Elapsed time is 2.37338 seconds.

tic; bar (20); toc;
⇒ Elapsed time is 2.04952 seconds.</pre> <p>But this does not give much information about where this time is spent; for instance, whether the single call to <code>expm</code> is more expensive or the recursive time-stepping itself. To get a more detailed picture, we can use the profiler. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">profile on;
foo;
profile off;

data = profile ("info");
profshow (data, 10);</pre> <p>This prints a table like: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">#  Function Attr     Time (s)        Calls

The entries like ‘<samp>binary *</samp>’ denote operators, while other entries are ordinary functions. They include both built-ins like <code>expm</code> and our own routines (for instance <code>timesteps</code>). From this profile, we can immediately deduce that <code>expm</code> uses up the largest proportion of the processing time, even though it is only called once. The second expensive operation is the matrix-vector product in the routine <code>timesteps</code>. <a id="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a> </p> <p>Timing, however, is not the only information available from the profile. The attribute column shows us that <code>timesteps</code> calls itself recursively. This may not be that remarkable in this example (since it’s clear anyway), but could be helpful in a more complex setting. As to the question of why is there a ‘<samp>binary \</samp>’ in the output, we can easily shed some light on that too. Note that <code>data</code> is a structure array (<a href="structure-arrays.html">Structure Arrays</a>) which contains the field <code>FunctionTable</code>. This stores the raw data for the profile shown. The number in the first column of the table gives the index under which the shown function can be found there. Looking up <code>data.FunctionTable(41)</code> gives: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">scalar structure containing the fields:

    FunctionName = binary \
    TotalTime =  0.18765
    NumCalls =  1
    IsRecursive = 0
    Parents =  7
    Children = [](1x0)</pre> <p>Here we see the information from the table again, but have additional fields <code>Parents</code> and <code>Children</code>. Those are both arrays, which contain the indices of functions which have directly called the function in question (which is entry 7, <code>expm</code>, in this case) or been called by it (no functions). Hence, the backslash operator has been used internally by <code>expm</code>. </p> <p>Now let’s take a look at <code>bar</code>. For this, we start a fresh profiling session (<code>profile on</code> does this; the old data is removed before the profiler is restarted): </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">profile on;
bar (20);
profile off;

profshow (profile ("info"));</pre> <p>This gives: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">#            Function Attr     Time (s)        Calls

It has been called 13,529 times in the course of recursively calculating the Fibonacci number in a suboptimal way, and most of the time was spent in <code>bar</code> itself. </p> <p>Finally, let’s say we want to profile the execution of both <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> together. Since we already have the run-time data collected for <code>bar</code>, we can restart the profiler without clearing the existing data and collect the missing statistics about <code>foo</code>.
