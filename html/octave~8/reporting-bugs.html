<div class="appendixsec" id="Reporting-Bugs">   <h1 class="appendixsec">D.2 Reporting Bugs</h1>   <p>Your bug reports play an essential role in making Octave reliable. </p> <p>When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it is already known. See <a href="trouble.html">Known Causes of Trouble</a>. If it isn’t known, then you should report the problem. </p> <p>Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem, or it may not. In any case, the principal function of a bug report is to help the entire community by making the next version of Octave work better. Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of Octave. </p> <p>In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the information that makes it possible to fix the bug. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="bug-criteria.html" accesskey="1">Have You Found a Bug?</a></li> <li><a href="bug-tracker.html" accesskey="2">Where to Report Bugs</a></li> <li><a href="bug-reporting.html" accesskey="3">How to Report Bugs</a></li> <li><a href="sending-patches.html" accesskey="4">Sending Patches for Octave</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
