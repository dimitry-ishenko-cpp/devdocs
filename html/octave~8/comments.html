<div class="section" id="Comments">   <h1 class="section">2.7 Comments in Octave Programs</h1>    <p>A <em>comment</em> is some text that is included in a program for the sake of human readers, and which is NOT an executable part of the program. Comments can explain what the program does, and how it works. Nearly all programming languages have provisions for comments, because programs are typically hard to understand without them. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="single-line-comments.html" accesskey="1">Single Line Comments</a></li> <li><a href="block-comments.html" accesskey="2">Block Comments</a></li> <li><a href="comments-and-the-help-system.html" accesskey="3">Comments and the Help System</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
