<div class="section" id="Plotting-on-top-of-Images">   <h1 class="section">32.4 Plotting on top of Images</h1> <p>If gnuplot is being used to display images it is possible to plot on top of images. Since an image is a matrix it is indexed by row and column values. The plotting system is, however, based on the traditional <em class="math">(x, y)</em> system. To minimize the difference between the two systems Octave places the origin of the coordinate system in the point corresponding to the pixel at <em class="math">(1, 1)</em>. So, to plot points given by row and column values on top of an image, one should simply call <code>plot</code> with the column values as the first argument and the row values as the second. As an example the following code generates an image with random intensities between 0 and 1, and shows the image with red circles over pixels with an intensity above <em class="math">0.99</em>. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">I = rand (100, 100);
[row, col] = find (I &gt; 0.99);
hold ("on");
imshow (I);
plot (col, row, "ro");
hold ("off");</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
