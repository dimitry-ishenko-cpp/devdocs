<div class="subsection" id="Indexing-Cell-Arrays">   <h1 class="subsection">6.3.3 Indexing Cell Arrays</h1> <p>As shown in see <a href="basic-usage-of-cell-arrays.html">Basic Usage of Cell Arrays</a> elements can be extracted from cell arrays using the ‘<samp>{</samp>’ and ‘<samp>}</samp>’ operators. If you want to extract or access subarrays which are still cell arrays, you need to use the ‘<samp>(</samp>’ and ‘<samp>)</samp>’ operators. The following example illustrates the difference: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">c = {"1", "2", "3"; "x", "y", "z"; "4", "5", "6"};
c{2,3}
     ⇒ ans = z

c(2,3)
     ⇒ ans =
        {
          [1,1] = z
        }</pre> <p>So with ‘<samp>{}</samp>’ you access elements of a cell array, while with ‘<samp>()</samp>’ you access a sub array of a cell array. </p> <p>Using the ‘<samp>(</samp>’ and ‘<samp>)</samp>’ operators, indexing works for cell arrays like for multi-dimensional arrays. As an example, all the rows of the first and third column of a cell array can be set to <code>0</code> with the following command: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">c(:, [1, 3]) = {0}
     ⇒ =
        {
          [1,1] = 0
          [2,1] = 0
          [3,1] = 0
          [1,2] = 2
          [2,2] = y
          [3,2] = 5
          [1,3] = 0
          [2,3] = 0
          [3,3] = 0
        }</pre> <p>Note, that the above can also be achieved like this: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">c(:, [1, 3]) = 0;</pre> <p>Here, the scalar ‘<samp>0</samp>’ is automatically promoted to cell array ‘<samp>{0}</samp>’ and then assigned to the subarray of <code>c</code>. </p> <p>To give another example for indexing cell arrays with ‘<samp>()</samp>’, you can exchange the first and the second row of a cell array as in the following command: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">c = {1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6};
c([1, 2], :) = c([2, 1], :)
     ⇒ =
        {
          [1,1] =  4
          [2,1] =  1
          [1,2] =  5
          [2,2] =  2
          [1,3] =  6
          [2,3] =  3
        }</pre> <p>Accessing multiple elements of a cell array with the ‘<samp>{</samp>’ and ‘<samp>}</samp>’ operators will result in a comma-separated list of all the requested elements (see <a href="comma_002dseparated-lists.html">Comma-Separated Lists</a>). Using the ‘<samp>{</samp>’ and ‘<samp>}</samp>’ operators the first two rows in the above example can be swapped back like this: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[c{[1,2], :}] = deal (c{[2, 1], :})
     ⇒ =
        {
          [1,1] =  1
          [2,1] =  4
          [1,2] =  2
          [2,2] =  5
          [1,3] =  3
          [2,3] =  6
        }</pre> <p>As for struct arrays and numerical arrays, the empty matrix ‘<samp>[]</samp>’ can be used to delete elements from a cell array: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">x = {"1", "2"; "3", "4"};
x(1, :) = []
     ⇒ x =
        {
          [1,1] = 3
          [1,2] = 4
        }</pre> <p>The following example shows how to just remove the contents of cell array elements but not delete the space for them: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">x = {"1", "2"; "3", "4"};
x(1, :) = {[]}
⇒ x =
      {
        [1,1] = [](0x0)
        [2,1] = 3
        [1,2] = [](0x0)
        [2,2] = 4
      }</pre> <p>The indexing operations operate on the cell array and not on the objects within the cell array. By contrast, <code>cellindexmat</code> applies matrix indexing to the objects within each cell array entry and returns the requested values. </p> <dl class="def"> <dt id="index-cellindexmat">
<span class="category">: </span><span><em><var>y</var> =</em> <strong>cellindexmat</strong> <em>(<var>x</var>, <var>varargin</var>)</em><a href="#index-cellindexmat" class="copiable-anchor"> ¶</a></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Perform indexing of matrices in a cell array. </p> <p>Given a cell array of matrices <var>x</var>, this function computes </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">Y = cell (size (X));
for i = 1:numel (X)
  Y{i} = X{i}(varargin{1}, varargin{2}, …, varargin{N});
endfor</pre> <p>The indexing arguments may be scalar (<code>2</code>), arrays (<code>[1, 3]</code>), ranges (<code>1:3</code>), or the colon operator (<code>":"</code>). However, the indexing keyword <code>end</code> is not available. </p> <p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="creating-cell-arrays.html#XREFcellslices">cellslices</a>, <a href="function-application.html#XREFcellfun">cellfun</a>. </p>
