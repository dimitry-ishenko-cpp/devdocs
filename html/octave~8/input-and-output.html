<div class="chapter" id="Input-and-Output">   <h1 class="chapter">14 Input and Output</h1> <p>Octave supports several ways of reading and writing data to or from the prompt or a file. The simplest functions for data Input and Output (I/O) are easy to use, but only provide limited control of how data is processed. For more control, a set of functions modeled after the C standard library are also provided by Octave. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="basic-input-and-output.html" accesskey="1">Basic Input and Output</a></li> <li><a href="c_002dstyle-i_002fo-functions.html" accesskey="2">C-Style I/O Functions</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
