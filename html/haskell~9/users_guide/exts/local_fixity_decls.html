<h1 id="id1">6.2.16. Local Fixity Declarations</h1>
<div class="_sphinx"> <div itemprop="articleBody">   <p id="local-fixity-declarations">A careful reading of the Haskell 98 Report reveals that fixity declarations (<code>infix</code>, <code>infixl</code>, and <code>infixr</code>) are permitted to appear inside local bindings such those introduced by <code>let</code> and <code>where</code>. However, the Haskell Report does not specify the semantics of such bindings very precisely.</p> <p>In GHC, a fixity declaration may accompany a local binding:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">let f = ...
    infixr 3 `f`
in
    ...
</pre> <p>and the fixity declaration applies wherever the binding is in scope. For example, in a <code>let</code>, it applies in the right-hand sides of other <code>let</code>-bindings and the body of the <code>let</code>C. Or, in recursive <code>do</code> expressions (<a class="reference internal" href="recursive_do.html#recursive-do-notation"><span class="std std-ref">The recursive do-notation</span></a>), the local fixity declarations of a <code>let</code> statement scope over other statements in the group, just as the bound name does.</p> <p>Moreover, a local fixity declaration <em>must</em> accompany a local binding of that name: it is not possible to revise the fixity of name bound elsewhere, as in</p> <pre data-language="haskell">let infixr 9 $ in ...
</pre> <p>Because local fixity declarations are technically Haskell 98, no extension is necessary to enable them.</p>  </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
