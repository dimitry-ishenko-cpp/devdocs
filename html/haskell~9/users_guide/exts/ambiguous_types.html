</dl> <p>Each user-written type signature is subjected to an <em>ambiguity check</em>. The ambiguity check rejects functions that can never be called. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: C a =&gt; Int
</pre> <p>The idea is there can be no legal calls to <code>f</code> because every call will give rise to an ambiguous constraint. Indeed, the <em>only</em> purpose of the ambiguity check is to report functions that cannot possibly be called. We could soundly omit the ambiguity check on type signatures entirely, at the expense of delaying ambiguity errors to call sites. Indeed, the language extension <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-AllowAmbiguousTypes"><code>AllowAmbiguousTypes</code></a> switches off the ambiguity check.</p> <p>Ambiguity can be subtle. Consider this example which uses functional dependencies:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">class D a b | a -&gt; b where ..
h :: D Int b =&gt; Int
</pre> <p>The <code>Int</code> may well fix <code>b</code> at the call site, so that signature should not be rejected. Moreover, the dependencies might be hidden. Consider</p> <pre data-language="haskell">class X a b where ...
class D a b | a -&gt; b where ...
instance D a b =&gt; X [a] b where...
h :: X a b =&gt; a -&gt; a
</pre> <p>Here <code>h</code>’s type looks ambiguous in <code>b</code>, but here’s a legal call:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">...(h [True])...
</pre> <p>That gives rise to a <code>(X [Bool] beta)</code> constraint, and using the instance means we need <code>(D Bool beta)</code> and that fixes <code>beta</code> via <code>D</code>’s fundep!</p> <p>Behind all these special cases there is a simple guiding principle. Consider</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: type
f = ...blah...

g :: type
g = f
</pre> <p>You would think that the definition of <code>g</code> would surely typecheck! After all <code>f</code> has exactly the same type, and <code>g=f</code>. But in fact <code>f</code>’s type is instantiated and the instantiated constraints are solved against the constraints bound by <code>g</code>’s signature. So, in the case an ambiguous type, solving will fail. For example, consider the earlier definition <code>f :: C a =&gt; Int</code>:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: C a =&gt; Int
f = ...blah...

g :: C a =&gt; Int
g = f
</pre> <p>In <code>g</code>’s definition, we’ll instantiate to <code>(C alpha)</code> and try to deduce <code>(C alpha)</code> from <code>(C a)</code>, and fail.</p> <p>So in fact we use this as our <em>definition</em> of ambiguity: a type <code>ty</code> is ambiguous if and only if <code>((undefined :: ty) :: ty)</code> would fail to typecheck. We use a very similar test for <em>inferred</em> types, to ensure that they too are unambiguous.</p> <p><em>Switching off the ambiguity check.</em> Even if a function has an ambiguous type according to the “guiding principle”, it is possible that the function is callable. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">class D a b where ...
instance D Bool b where ...

strange :: D a b =&gt; a -&gt; a
strange = ...blah...

foo = strange True
</pre> <p>Here <code>strange</code>’s type is ambiguous, but the call in <code>foo</code> is OK because it gives rise to a constraint <code>(D Bool beta)</code>, which is soluble by the <code>(D Bool b)</code> instance.</p> <p>Another way of getting rid of the ambiguity at the call site is to use the <a class="reference internal" href="type_applications.html#extension-TypeApplications"><code>TypeApplications</code></a> extension to specify the types. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">class D a b where
  h :: b
instance D Int Int where ...

main = print (h @Int @Int)
</pre> <p>Here <code>a</code> is ambiguous in the definition of <code>D</code> but later specified to be <code>Int</code> using type applications.</p> <p><a class="reference internal" href="#extension-AllowAmbiguousTypes"><code>AllowAmbiguousTypes</code></a> allows you to switch off the ambiguity check. However, even with ambiguity checking switched off, GHC will complain about a function that can <em>never</em> be called, such as this one:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: (Int ~ Bool) =&gt; a -&gt; a
</pre> <p>Sometimes <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-AllowAmbiguousTypes"><code>AllowAmbiguousTypes</code></a> does not mix well with <a class="reference internal" href="rank_polymorphism.html#extension-RankNTypes"><code>RankNTypes</code></a>. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">foo :: forall r. (forall i. (KnownNat i) =&gt; r) -&gt; r
foo f = f @1

boo :: forall j. (KnownNat j) =&gt; Int
boo = ....

h :: Int
h = foo boo
</pre> <p>This program will be rejected as ambiguous because GHC will not unify the type variables <code>j</code> and <code>i</code>.</p> <p>Unlike the previous examples, it is not currently possible to resolve the ambiguity manually by using <a class="reference internal" href="type_applications.html#extension-TypeApplications"><code>TypeApplications</code></a>.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p><em>A historical note.</em> GHC used to impose some more restrictive and less principled conditions on type signatures. For type <code>forall tv1..tvn (c1, ...,cn) =&gt; type</code> GHC used to require</p>  <ol class="loweralpha simple"> <li>that each universally quantified type variable <code>tvi</code> must be “reachable” from <code>type</code>, and</li> <li>that every constraint <code>ci</code> mentions at least one of the universally quantified type variables <code>tvi</code>. These ad-hoc restrictions are completely subsumed by the new ambiguity check.</li> </ol>  </div>  </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
