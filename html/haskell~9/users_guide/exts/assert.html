<h1 id="id1">6.19.4. Assertions</h1>
<div class="_sphinx"> <div itemprop="articleBody">   <p id="assertions">If you want to make use of assertions in your standard Haskell code, you could define a function like the following:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">assert :: Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a
assert False x = error "assertion failed!"
assert _     x = x
</pre> <p>which works, but gives you back a less than useful error message – an assertion failed, but which and where?</p> <p>One way out is to define an extended <code>assert</code> function which also takes a descriptive string to include in the error message and perhaps combine this with the use of a pre-processor which inserts the source location where <code>assert</code> was used.</p> <p>GHC offers a helping hand here, doing all of this for you. For every use of <code>assert</code> in the user’s source:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">kelvinToC :: Double -&gt; Double
kelvinToC k = assert (k &gt;= 0.0) (k-273.15)
</pre> <p>GHC will rewrite this to also include the source location where the assertion was made,</p> <pre data-language="haskell">assert pred val ==&gt; assertError "Main.hs|15" pred val
</pre> <p>The rewrite is only performed by the compiler when it spots applications of <a class="reference external" href="../../libraries/base-4.17.0.0/control-exception.html#v:assert">Control.Exception.assert</a>, so you can still define and use your own versions of <code>assert</code>, should you so wish. If not, import <code>Control.Exception</code> to make use <code>assert</code> in your code.</p> <p id="index-1">GHC ignores assertions when optimisation is turned on with the <a class="reference internal" href="../using-optimisation.html#ghc-flag--O"><code>-O</code></a> flag. That is, expressions of the form <code>assert pred e</code> will be rewritten to <code>e</code>. You can also disable assertions using the <a class="reference internal" href="../using-optimisation.html#ghc-flag--fignore-asserts"><code>-fignore-asserts</code></a> option. The option <a class="reference internal" href="../using-optimisation.html#ghc-flag--fignore-asserts"><code>-fno-ignore-asserts</code></a> allows enabling assertions even when optimisation is turned on.</p> <p>Assertion failures can be caught, see the documentation for the <a class="reference external" href="../../libraries/base-4.17.0.0/control-exception.html">Control.Exception</a> library for the details.</p>  </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
