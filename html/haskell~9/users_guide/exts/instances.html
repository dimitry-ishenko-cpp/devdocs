</dl> <p>In Haskell 98 the head of an instance declaration must be of the form <code>C (T a1 ... an)</code>, where <code>C</code> is the class, <code>T</code> is a data type constructor, and the <code>a1 ... an</code> are distinct type variables. In the case of multi-parameter type classes, this rule applies to each parameter of the instance head (Arguably it should be okay if just one has this form and the others are type variables, but that’s the rules at the moment).</p> <p>GHC relaxes this rule in two ways:</p> <ul> <li>
<p class="first">With the <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-TypeSynonymInstances"><code>TypeSynonymInstances</code></a> extension, instance heads may use type synonyms.

instance C (Point a) where ...
</pre> <p>is legal. The instance declaration is equivalent to</p> <pre data-language="haskell">instance C (a,a) where ...
</pre> <p>As always, type synonyms must be fully applied. You cannot, for example, write:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">instance Monad Point where ...

<p class="first">The <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-FlexibleInstances"><code>FlexibleInstances</code></a> extension allows the head of the instance declaration to mention arbitrary nested types.

</dl> <p>Regardless of <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-FlexibleInstances"><code>FlexibleInstances</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="flexible_contexts.html#extension-FlexibleContexts"><code>FlexibleContexts</code></a>, instance declarations must conform to some rules that ensure that instance resolution will terminate. The restrictions can be lifted with <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-UndecidableInstances"><code>UndecidableInstances</code></a> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#undecidable-instances"><span class="std std-ref">Instance termination rules</span></a>).</p> <p>The rules are these:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>The Paterson Conditions: for each class constraint <code>(C t1 ... tn)</code> in the context<ol class="arabic"> <li>No type variable has more occurrences in the constraint than in the head</li> <li>The constraint has fewer constructors and variables (taken together and counting repetitions) than the head</li> <li>The constraint mentions no type functions.

For each functional dependency, ⟨tvs⟩<sub>left</sub> <code>-&gt;</code> ⟨tvs⟩<sub>right</sub>, of the class, every type variable in S(⟨tvs⟩<sub>right</sub>) must appear in S(⟨tvs⟩<sub>left</sub>), where S is the substitution mapping each type variable in the class declaration to the corresponding type in the instance head.</li> </ol> <p>These restrictions ensure that instance resolution terminates: each reduction step makes the problem smaller by at least one constructor. You can find lots of background material about the reason for these restrictions in the paper <a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jfp06.pdf">Understanding functional dependencies via Constraint Handling Rules</a>.</p> <p>For example, these are okay:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">instance C Int [a]          -- Multiple parameters
instance Eq (S [a])         -- Structured type in head

    -- Repeated type variable in head
instance C4 a a =&gt; C4 [a] [a]
instance Stateful (ST s) (MutVar s)

    -- Head can consist of type variables only
instance C a
instance (Eq a, Show b) =&gt; C2 a b

    -- Non-type variables in context
instance Show (s a) =&gt; Show (Sized s a)
instance C2 Int a =&gt; C3 Bool [a]
instance C2 Int a =&gt; C3 [a] b
</pre> <p>But these are not:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">    -- Context assertion no smaller than head
instance C a =&gt; C a where ...
    -- (C b b) has more occurrences of b than the head
instance C b b =&gt; Foo [b] where ...
</pre> <p>The same restrictions apply to instances generated by <code>deriving</code> clauses. Thus the following is accepted:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">data MinHeap h a = H a (h a)
  deriving (Show)
</pre> <p>because the derived instance</p> <pre data-language="haskell">instance (Show a, Show (h a)) =&gt; Show (MinHeap h a)
</pre> <p>conforms to the above rules.</p> <p>The restrictions on functional dependencies (<a class="reference internal" href="functional_dependencies.html#functional-dependencies"><span class="std std-ref">Functional dependencies</span></a>) are particularly troublesome. It is tempting to introduce type variables in the context that do not appear in the head, something that is excluded by the normal rules. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">class HasConverter a b | a -&gt; b where
   convert :: a -&gt; b

data Foo a = MkFoo a

instance (HasConverter a b,Show b) =&gt; Show (Foo a) where
   show (MkFoo value) = show (convert value)
</pre> <p>This is dangerous territory, however. Here, for example, is a program that would make the typechecker loop:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">class D a
class F a b | a-&gt;b
instance F [a] [[a]]
instance (D c, F a c) =&gt; D [a]   -- 'c' is not mentioned in the head
</pre> <p>Similarly, it can be tempting to lift the coverage condition:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">class Mul a b c | a b -&gt; c where
  (.*.) :: a -&gt; b -&gt; c

instance Mul Int Int Int where (.*.) = (*)
instance Mul Int Float Float where x .*. y = fromIntegral x * y
instance Mul a b c =&gt; Mul a [b] [c] where x .*. v = map (x.*.) v
</pre> <p>The third instance declaration does not obey the coverage condition; and indeed the (somewhat strange) definition:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f = \ b x y -&gt; if b then x .*. [y] else y
</pre> <p>makes instance inference go into a loop, because it requires the constraint <code>(Mul a [b] b)</code>.</p> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-UndecidableInstances"><code>UndecidableInstances</code></a> extension is also used to lift some of the restrictions imposed on type family instances.

</dl> <p>In general, as discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="#instance-resolution"><span class="std std-ref">Instance declarations and resolution</span></a>, <em>GHC requires that it be unambiguous which instance declaration should be used to resolve a type-class constraint</em>. GHC also provides a way to loosen the instance resolution, by allowing more than one instance to match, <em>provided there is a most specific one</em>. Moreover, it can be loosened further, by allowing more than one instance to match irrespective of whether there is a most specific one. This section gives the details.</p> <p>To control the choice of instance, it is possible to specify the overlap behavior for individual instances with a pragma, written immediately after the <code>instance</code> keyword. The pragma may be one of: <code>{-# OVERLAPPING #-}</code>, <code>{-# OVERLAPPABLE #-}</code>, <code>{-# OVERLAPS #-}</code>, or <code>{-# INCOHERENT #-}</code>.</p> <p>The matching behaviour is also influenced by two module-level language extension flags: <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-OverlappingInstances"><code>OverlappingInstances</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-IncoherentInstances"><code>IncoherentInstances</code></a>. These extensions are now deprecated (since GHC 7.10) in favour of the fine-grained per-instance pragmas.</p> <p>A more precise specification is as follows. The willingness to be overlapped or incoherent is a property of the <em>instance declaration</em> itself, controlled as follows:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>An instance is <em>incoherent</em> if: it has an <code>INCOHERENT</code> pragma; or if the instance has no pragma and it appears in a module compiled with <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-IncoherentInstances"><code>IncoherentInstances</code></a>.</li> <li>An instance is <em>overlappable</em> if: it has an <code>OVERLAPPABLE</code> or <code>OVERLAPS</code> pragma; or if the instance has no pragma and it appears in a module compiled with <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-OverlappingInstances"><code>OverlappingInstances</code></a>; or if the instance is incoherent.</li> <li>An instance is <em>overlapping</em> if: it has an <code>OVERLAPPING</code> or <code>OVERLAPS</code> pragma; or if the instance has no pragma and it appears in a module compiled with <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-OverlappingInstances"><code>OverlappingInstances</code></a>; or if the instance is incoherent.</li> </ul> <p>Now suppose that, in some client module, we are searching for an instance of the <em>target constraint</em> <code>(C ty1 .. tyn)</code>. The search works like this:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Find all instances <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> that <em>match</em> the target constraint; that is, the target constraint is a substitution instance of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span>. These instance declarations are the <em>candidates</em>.</li> <li>If no candidates remain, the search fails</li> <li>Eliminate any candidate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(IX\)</span> for which there is another candidate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(IY\)</span> such that both of the following hold:<ul> <li>
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(IY\)</span> is strictly more specific than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(IX\)</span>. That is, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(IY\)</span> is a substitution instance of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(IX\)</span> but not vice versa.</li> <li>Either <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(IX\)</span> is <em>overlappable</em>, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(IY\)</span> is <em>overlapping</em>. (This “either/or” design, rather than a “both/and” design, allow a client to deliberately override an instance from a library, without requiring a change to the library.)</li> </ul> </li> <li>If all the remaining candidates are incoherent, the search succeeds, returning an arbitrary surviving candidate.</li> <li>If more than one non-incoherent candidate remains, the search fails.</li> <li>Otherwise there is exactly one non-incoherent candidate; call it the “prime candidate”.</li> <li>Now find all instances, or in-scope given constraints, that <em>unify</em> with the target constraint, but do not <em>match</em> it. Such non-candidate instances might match when the target constraint is further instantiated. If all of them are incoherent top-level instances, the search succeeds, returning the prime candidate. Otherwise the search fails.</li> </ul> <p>Notice that these rules are not influenced by flag settings in the client module, where the instances are <em>used</em>. These rules make it possible for a library author to design a library that relies on overlapping instances without the client having to know.</p> <p>Errors are reported <em>lazily</em> (when attempting to solve a constraint), rather than <em>eagerly</em> (when the instances themselves are defined). Consider, for example</p> <pre data-language="haskell">instance C Int  b where ..
instance C a Bool where ..
</pre> <p>These potentially overlap, but GHC will not complain about the instance declarations themselves, regardless of flag settings. If we later try to solve the constraint <code>(C Int Char)</code> then only the first instance matches, and all is well. Similarly with <code>(C Bool Bool)</code>. But if we try to solve <code>(C Int Bool)</code>, both instances match and an error is reported.</p> <p>As a more substantial example of the rules in action, consider</p> <pre data-language="haskell">instance {-# OVERLAPPABLE #-} context1 =&gt; C Int b     where ...  -- (A)
instance {-# OVERLAPPABLE #-} context2 =&gt; C a   Bool  where ...  -- (B)
instance {-# OVERLAPPABLE #-} context3 =&gt; C a   [b]   where ...  -- (C)
instance {-# OVERLAPPING  #-} context4 =&gt; C Int [Int] where ...  -- (D)
</pre> <p>(These all need <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-FlexibleInstances"><code>FlexibleInstances</code></a>.) Now suppose that the type inference engine needs to solve the constraint <code>C Int [Int]</code>. This constraint matches instances (A), (C) and (D), but the last is more specific, and hence is chosen.</p> <p>If (D) did not exist then (A) and (C) would still be matched, but neither is most specific. In that case, the program would be rejected, unless <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-IncoherentInstances"><code>IncoherentInstances</code></a> is enabled, in which case it would be accepted and (A) or (C) would be chosen arbitrarily.</p> <p>An instance declaration is <em>more specific</em> than another iff the head of former is a substitution instance of the latter. For example (D) is “more specific” than (C) because you can get from (C) to (D) by substituting <code>a := Int</code> and <code>b := Int</code>.</p> <p>The final bullet (about unifying instances) makes GHC conservative about committing to an overlapping instance. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: [b] -&gt; [b]
f x = ...
</pre> <p>Suppose that from the RHS of <code>f</code> we get the constraint <code>C b [b]</code>. But GHC does not commit to instance (C), because in a particular call of <code>f</code>, <code>b</code> might be instantiated to <code>Int</code>, in which case instance (D) would be more specific still. So GHC rejects the program.</p> <p>If, however, you enable the extension <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-IncoherentInstances"><code>IncoherentInstances</code></a> when compiling the module that contains (D), GHC will instead pick (C), without complaining about the problem of subsequent instantiations.</p> <p>Notice that we gave a type signature to <code>f</code>, so GHC had to <em>check</em> that <code>f</code> has the specified type. Suppose instead we do not give a type signature, asking GHC to <em>infer</em> it instead. In this case, GHC will refrain from simplifying the constraint <code>C Int [b]</code> (for the same reason as before) but, rather than rejecting the program, it will infer the type</p> <pre data-language="haskell">f :: C b [b] =&gt; [b] -&gt; [b]
</pre> <p>That postpones the question of which instance to pick to the call site for <code>f</code> by which time more is known about the type <code>b</code>. You will need the <a class="reference internal" href="flexible_contexts.html#extension-FlexibleContexts"><code>FlexibleContexts</code></a> extension.</p> <p>Exactly the same situation can arise in instance declarations themselves. Suppose we have</p> <pre data-language="haskell">class Foo a where
   f :: a -&gt; a
instance Foo [b] where
   f x = ...
</pre> <p>and, as before, the constraint <code>C Int [b]</code> arises from <code>f</code>’s right hand side. GHC will reject the instance, complaining as before that it does not know how to resolve the constraint <code>C Int [b]</code>, because it matches more than one instance declaration. The solution is to postpone the choice by adding the constraint to the context of the instance declaration, thus:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">instance C Int [b] =&gt; Foo [b] where
   f x = ...
</pre> <p>(You need <a class="reference internal" href="flexible_contexts.html#extension-FlexibleContexts"><code>FlexibleContexts</code></a> to do this.)</p> <p>In the unification check in the final bullet, GHC also uses the “in-scope given constraints”. Consider for example</p> <pre data-language="haskell">instance C a Int

g :: forall b c. C b Int =&gt; blah
g = ...needs (C c Int)...
</pre> <p>Here GHC will not solve the constraint <code>(C c Int)</code> from the top-level instance, because a particular call of <code>g</code> might instantiate both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> to the same type, which would allow the constraint to be solved in a different way. This latter restriction is principally to make the constraint-solver complete. (Interested folk can read <code>Note [Instance and Given overlap]</code> in <code>TcInteract</code>.) It is easy to avoid: in a type signature avoid a constraint that matches a top-level instance. The flag <a class="reference internal" href="../using-warnings.html#ghc-flag--Wsimplifiable-class-constraints"><code>-Wsimplifiable-class-constraints</code></a> warns about such signatures.</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p> <p>Overlapping instances must be used with care. They can give rise to incoherence (i.e. different instance choices are made in different parts of the program) even without <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-IncoherentInstances"><code>IncoherentInstances</code></a>. Consider:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE OverlappingInstances #-}

</dl> <p>In Haskell, you can’t write a type signature in an instance declaration, but it is sometimes convenient to do so, and the language extension <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-InstanceSigs"><code>InstanceSigs</code></a> allows you to do so. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">data T a = MkT a a

</pre> <p>Some details</p> <ul> <li>
<p class="first">The type signature in the instance declaration must be more polymorphic than (or the same as) the one in the class declaration, instantiated with the instance type. For example, this is fine:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">instance Eq a =&gt; Eq (T a) where

<p class="first">One stylistic reason for wanting to write a type signature is simple documentation. Another is that you may want to bring scoped type variables into scope. For example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">class C a where
