</dl> <p>Generalised list comprehensions are a further enhancement to the list comprehension syntactic sugar to allow operations such as sorting and grouping which are familiar from SQL. They are fully described in the paper <a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/list-comp.pdf">Comprehensive comprehensions: comprehensions with “order by” and “group by”</a>, except that the syntax we use differs slightly from the paper.</p> <p>The extension is enabled with the extension <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-TransformListComp"><code>TransformListComp</code></a>.</p> <p>Here is an example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">employees = [ ("Simon", "MS", 80)
            , ("Erik", "MS", 100)
            , ("Phil", "Ed", 40)
            , ("Gordon", "Ed", 45)
            , ("Paul", "Yale", 60) ]

output = [ (the dept, sum salary)
         | (name, dept, salary) &lt;- employees
         , then group by dept using groupWith
         , then sortWith by (sum salary)
         , then take 5 ]
</pre> <p>In this example, the list <code>output</code> would take on the value:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">[("Yale", 60), ("Ed", 85), ("MS", 180)]
</pre> <p>There are three new keywords: <code>group</code>, <code>by</code>, and <code>using</code>. (The functions <code>sortWith</code> and <code>groupWith</code> are not keywords; they are ordinary functions that are exported by <code>GHC.Exts</code>.)</p> <p>There are five new forms of comprehension qualifier, all introduced by the (existing) keyword <code>then</code>:</p> <ul> <li>
<pre data-language="haskell">then f
</pre> <p>This statement requires that f have the type forall a. [a] -&gt; [a] . You can see an example of its use in the motivating example, as this form is used to apply take 5 .</p> </li> <li>
<pre data-language="haskell">then f by e
</pre> <p>This form is similar to the previous one, but allows you to create a function which will be passed as the first argument to f. As a consequence f must have the type <code>forall a. (a -&gt; t) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code>. As you can see from the type, this function lets f “project out” some information from the elements of the list it is transforming.</p> <p>An example is shown in the opening example, where <code>sortWith</code> is supplied with a function that lets it find out the <code>sum salary</code> for any item in the list comprehension it transforms.</p> </li> <li>
<pre data-language="haskell">then group by e using f
</pre> <p>This is the most general of the grouping-type statements. In this form, f is required to have type <code>forall a. (a -&gt; t) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]]</code>. As with the <code>then f by e</code> case above, the first argument is a function supplied to f by the compiler which lets it compute e on every element of the list being transformed. However, unlike the non-grouping case, f additionally partitions the list into a number of sublists: this means that at every point after this statement, binders occurring before it in the comprehension refer to <em>lists</em> of possible values, not single values. To help understand this, let’s look at an example:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">-- This works similarly to groupWith in GHC.Exts, but doesn't sort its input first
groupRuns :: Eq b =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]]
groupRuns f = groupBy (\x y -&gt; f x == f y)

output = [ (the x, y)
| x &lt;- ([1..3] ++ [1..2])
, y &lt;- [4..6]
, then group by x using groupRuns ]
</pre> <p>This results in the variable <code>output</code> taking on the value below:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">[(1, [4, 5, 6]), (2, [4, 5, 6]), (3, [4, 5, 6]), (1, [4, 5, 6]), (2, [4, 5, 6])]
</pre> <p>Note that we have used the <code>the</code> function to change the type of x from a list to its original numeric type. The variable y, in contrast, is left unchanged from the list form introduced by the grouping.</p> </li> <li>
<pre data-language="haskell">then group using f
</pre> <p>With this form of the group statement, f is required to simply have the type <code>forall a. [a] -&gt; [[a]]</code>, which will be used to group up the comprehension so far directly. An example of this form is as follows:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">output = [ x
| y &lt;- [1..5]
, x &lt;- "hello"
, then group using inits]
</pre> <p>This will yield a list containing every prefix of the word “hello” written out 5 times:</p> <pre data-language="haskell">["","h","he","hel","hell","hello","helloh","hellohe","hellohel","hellohell","hellohello","hellohelloh",...]
</pre> </li> </ul>  </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
