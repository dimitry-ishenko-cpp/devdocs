<h1 id="introduction-ghc">1. Introduction</h1>
<div class="_sphinx"> <div itemprop="articleBody">   <p id="introduction">This is a guide to using the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC): an interactive and batch compilation system for the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell 2010</a> language.</p> <p>GHC has two main components: an interactive Haskell interpreter (also known as GHCi), described in <a class="reference internal" href="ghci.html#ghci"><span class="std std-ref">Using GHCi</span></a>, and a batch compiler, described throughout <a class="reference internal" href="using.html#using-ghc"><span class="std std-ref">Using GHC</span></a>. In fact, GHC consists of a single program which is just run with different options to provide either the interactive or the batch system.</p> <p>The batch compiler can be used alongside GHCi: compiled modules can be loaded into an interactive session and used in the same way as interpreted code, and in fact when using GHCi most of the library code will be pre-compiled. This means you get the best of both worlds: fast pre-compiled library code, and fast compile turnaround for the parts of your program being actively developed.</p> <p>GHC supports numerous language extensions, including concurrency, a foreign function interface, exceptions, type system extensions such as multi-parameter type classes, local universal and existential quantification, functional dependencies, scoped type variables and explicit unboxed types. These are all described in <a class="reference internal" href="exts.html#ghc-language-features"><span class="std std-ref">Language extensions</span></a>.</p> <p>GHC has a comprehensive optimiser, so when you want to Really Go For It (and you’ve got time to spare) GHC can produce pretty fast code. Alternatively, the default option is to compile as fast as possible while not making too much effort to optimise the generated code (although GHC probably isn’t what you’d describe as a fast compiler :-).</p> <p>GHC’s profiling system supports “cost centre stacks”: a way of seeing the profile of a Haskell program in a call-graph like structure. See <a class="reference internal" href="profiling.html#profiling"><span class="std std-ref">Profiling</span></a> for more details.</p> <p>GHC comes with a number of libraries. These are described in separate documentation.</p>  <h2 id="getting">1.1. Obtaining GHC</h2> <p id="obtaining-ghc">Go to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC home page</a> and follow the “download” link to download GHC for your platform.</p> <p>Alternatively, if you want to build GHC yourself, head on over to the <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/building">GHC Building Guide</a> to find out how to get the sources, and build it on your system. Note that GHC itself is written in Haskell, so you will still need to install GHC in order to build it.</p>   <h2 id="mailing-lists-ghc">1.2. Meta-information: Web sites, mailing lists, etc.</h2> <p id="meta-information-web-sites-mailing-lists-etc">On the World-Wide Web, there are several URLs of likely interest:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC home page</a></li> <li>

Reporting bugs in GHC</h2> <p id="reporting-bugs-in-ghc">Glasgow Haskell is a changing system so there are sure to be bugs in it. If you find one, please see <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/report-a-bug">this wiki page</a> for information on how to report it.</p>   <h2 id="version-numbering">1.4. GHC version numbering policy</h2> <p id="ghc-version-numbering-policy">As of GHC version 6.8, we have adopted the following policy for numbering GHC versions:</p>  <p>Stable branches are numbered <code>x.y</code>, where ⟨y⟩ is <em>even</em>. Releases on the stable branch <code>x.y</code> are numbered <code>x.y.z</code>, where ⟨z⟩ (&gt;= 1) is the patchlevel number. Patchlevels are bug-fix releases only, and never change the programmer interface to any system-supplied code. However, if you install a new patchlevel over an old one you will need to recompile any code that was compiled against the old libraries.</p> <p>The value of <code>__GLASGOW_HASKELL__</code> (see <a class="reference internal" href="phases.html#c-pre-processor"><span class="std std-ref">Options affecting the C pre-processor</span></a>) for a major release <code>x.y.z</code> is the integer ⟨xyy⟩ (if ⟨y⟩ is a single digit, then a leading zero is added, so for example in version 6.8.2 of GHC we would have <code>__GLASGOW_HASKELL__==608</code>).</p> <p id="index-3">We may make snapshot releases of the current stable branch <a class="reference external" href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/latest/">available for download</a>, and the latest sources are available from <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/repositories">the git repositories</a>.</p> <p>Stable snapshot releases are named <code>x.y.z.YYYYMMDD</code>. where <code>YYYYMMDD</code> is the date of the sources from which the snapshot was built, and <code>x.y.z+1</code> is the next release to be made on that branch. For example, <code>6.8.1.20040225</code> would be a snapshot of the <code>6.8</code> branch during the development of <code>6.8.2</code>.</p> <p>Unstable snapshot releases are named <code>x.y.YYYYMMDD</code>. where <code>YYYYMMDD</code> is the date of the sources from which the snapshot was built. For example, <code>6.7.20040225</code> would be a snapshot of the HEAD before the creation of the <code>6.8</code> branch.</p> <p>The value of <code>__GLASGOW_HASKELL__</code> for a snapshot release is the integer ⟨xyy⟩. You should never write any conditional code which tests for this value, however: since interfaces change on a day-to-day basis, and we don’t have finer granularity in the values of <code>__GLASGOW_HASKELL__</code>, you should only conditionally compile using predicates which test whether <code>__GLASGOW_HASKELL__</code> is equal to, later than, or earlier than a given major release.</p>  <p>The version number of your copy of GHC can be found by invoking <code>ghc</code> with the <code>--version</code> flag (see <a class="reference internal" href="using.html#options-help"><span class="std std-ref">Verbosity options</span></a>).</p> <p>The compiler version can be tested within compiled code with the <code>MIN_VERSION_GLASGOW_HASKELL</code> CPP macro (defined only when <a class="reference internal" href="phases.html#extension-CPP"><code>CPP</code></a> is used). See <a class="reference internal" href="phases.html#standard-cpp-macros"><span class="std std-ref">Standard CPP macros</span></a> for details.</p>   <h2 id="license">1.5.
