<section id="building-redistributable-binaries"> <h1>Building redistributable binaries</h1> <p>When <code>python -m build</code> or <code>pip wheel</code> is used to build a NumPy wheel, that wheel will rely on external shared libraries (at least for BLAS/LAPACK and a Fortran compiler runtime library, perhaps other libraries). Such wheels therefore will only run on the system on which they are built. See <a class="reference external" href="https://pypackaging-native.github.io/meta-topics/build_steps_conceptual/#building-and-installing-or-uploading-artifacts">the pypackaging-native content under “Building and installing or uploading artifacts”</a> for more context on that.</p> <p>A wheel like that is therefore an intermediate stage to producing a binary that can be distributed. That final binary may be a wheel - in that case, run <code>auditwheel</code> (Linux), <code>delocate</code> (macOS) or <code>delvewheel</code> (Windows) to vendor the required shared libraries into the wheel.</p> <p>The final binary may also be in another packaging format (e.g., a <code>.rpm</code>, <code>.deb</code> or <code>.conda</code> package). In that case, there are packaging ecosystem-specific tools to first install the wheel into a staging area, then making the extension modules in that install location relocatable (e.g., by rewriting RPATHs), and then repackaging it into the final package format.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
