<section id="introspecting-build-steps"> <h1 id="meson-introspection">Introspecting build steps</h1> <p>When you have an issue with a particular Python extension module or other build target, there are a number of ways to figure out what the build system is doing exactly. Beyond looking at the <code>meson.build</code> content for the target of interest, these include:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>Reading the generated <code>build.ninja</code> file in the build directory,</li> <li>Using <code>meson introspect</code> to learn more about build options, dependencies and flags used for the target,</li> <li>Reading <code>&lt;build-dir&gt;/meson-info/*.json</code> for details on discovered dependencies, where Meson plans to install files to, etc.</li> </ol> <p>These things are all available after the configure stage of the build (i.e., <code>meson setup</code>) has run. It is typically more effective to look at this information, rather than running the build and reading the full build log.</p> <p>For more details on this topic, see the <a class="reference external" href="http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/building/introspecting_a_build.html">SciPy doc page on build introspection</a>.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
