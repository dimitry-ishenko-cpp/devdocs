<h1>Beyond the Basics</h1>   <section id="iterating-over-elements-in-the-array"> <h2>Iterating over elements in the array</h2> <section id="basic-iteration"> <h3 id="sec-array-iterator">Basic Iteration</h3> <p>One common algorithmic requirement is to be able to walk over all elements in a multidimensional array. The array iterator object makes this easy to do in a generic way that works for arrays of any dimension. Naturally, if you know the number of dimensions you will be using, then you can always write nested for loops to accomplish the iteration. If, however, you want to write code that works with any number of dimensions, then you can make use of the array iterator. An array iterator object is returned when accessing the .flat attribute of an array.</p> <p id="index-0">Basic usage is to call <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_IterNew" title="PyArray_IterNew"><code>PyArray_IterNew</code></a> ( <code>array</code> ) where array is an ndarray object (or one of its sub-classes). The returned object is an array-iterator object (the same object returned by the .flat attribute of the ndarray). This object is usually cast to PyArrayIterObject* so that its members can be accessed. The only members that are needed are <code>iter-&gt;size</code> which contains the total size of the array, <code>iter-&gt;index</code>, which contains the current 1-d index into the array, and <code>iter-&gt;dataptr</code> which is a pointer to the data for the current element of the array. Sometimes it is also useful to access <code>iter-&gt;ao</code> which is a pointer to the underlying ndarray object.</p> <p>After processing data at the current element of the array, the next element of the array can be obtained using the macro <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_ITER_NEXT" title="PyArray_ITER_NEXT"><code>PyArray_ITER_NEXT</code></a> ( <code>iter</code> ). The iteration always proceeds in a C-style contiguous fashion (last index varying the fastest). The <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_ITER_GOTO" title="PyArray_ITER_GOTO"><code>PyArray_ITER_GOTO</code></a> ( <code>iter</code>, <code>destination</code> ) can be used to jump to a particular point in the array, where <code>destination</code> is an array of npy_intp data-type with space to handle at least the number of dimensions in the underlying array. Occasionally it is useful to use <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_ITER_GOTO1D" title="PyArray_ITER_GOTO1D"><code>PyArray_ITER_GOTO1D</code></a> ( <code>iter</code>, <code>index</code> ) which will jump to the 1-d index given by the value of <code>index</code>. The most common usage, however, is given in the following example.</p> <pre data-language="c">PyObject *obj; /* assumed to be some ndarray object */
PyArrayIterObject *iter;
...
iter = (PyArrayIterObject *)PyArray_IterNew(obj);
if (iter == NULL) goto fail;   /* Assume fail has clean-up code */
while (iter-&gt;index &lt; iter-&gt;size) {
    /* do something with the data at it-&gt;dataptr */
    PyArray_ITER_NEXT(it);
}
...
</pre> <p>You can also use <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArrayIter_Check" title="PyArrayIter_Check"><code>PyArrayIter_Check</code></a> ( <code>obj</code> ) to ensure you have an iterator object and <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_ITER_RESET" title="PyArray_ITER_RESET"><code>PyArray_ITER_RESET</code></a> ( <code>iter</code> ) to reset an iterator object back to the beginning of the array.</p> <p>It should be emphasized at this point that you may not need the array iterator if your array is already contiguous (using an array iterator will work but will be slower than the fastest code you could write). The major purpose of array iterators is to encapsulate iteration over N-dimensional arrays with arbitrary strides. They are used in many, many places in the NumPy source code itself. If you already know your array is contiguous (Fortran or C), then simply adding the element- size to a running pointer variable will step you through the array very efficiently. In other words, code like this will probably be faster for you in the contiguous case (assuming doubles).</p> <pre data-language="c">npy_intp size;
double *dptr;  /* could make this any variable type */
size = PyArray_SIZE(obj);
dptr = PyArray_DATA(obj);
while(size--) {
   /* do something with the data at dptr */
   dptr++;
}
</pre> </section> <section id="iterating-over-all-but-one-axis"> <h3>Iterating over all but one axis</h3> <p>A common algorithm is to loop over all elements of an array and perform some function with each element by issuing a function call. As function calls can be time consuming, one way to speed up this kind of algorithm is to write the function so it takes a vector of data and then write the iteration so the function call is performed for an entire dimension of data at a time. This increases the amount of work done per function call, thereby reducing the function-call over-head to a small(er) fraction of the total time. Even if the interior of the loop is performed without a function call it can be advantageous to perform the inner loop over the dimension with the highest number of elements to take advantage of speed enhancements available on micro- processors that use pipelining to enhance fundamental operations.</p> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_IterAllButAxis" title="PyArray_IterAllButAxis"><code>PyArray_IterAllButAxis</code></a> ( <code>array</code>, <code>&amp;dim</code> ) constructs an iterator object that is modified so that it will not iterate over the dimension indicated by dim.

Note that the returned object from this routine is still usually cast to PyArrayIterObject *. All that’s been done is to modify the strides and dimensions of the returned iterator to simulate iterating over array[…,0,…] where 0 is placed on the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\textrm{dim}^{\textrm{th}}\)</span> dimension. If dim is negative, then the dimension with the largest axis is found and used.</p> </section> <section id="iterating-over-multiple-arrays"> <h3>Iterating over multiple arrays</h3> <p>Very often, it is desirable to iterate over several arrays at the same time. The universal functions are an example of this kind of behavior. If all you want to do is iterate over arrays with the same shape, then simply creating several iterator objects is the standard procedure. For example, the following code iterates over two arrays assumed to be the same shape and size (actually obj1 just has to have at least as many total elements as does obj2):</p> <pre data-language="c">/* It is already assumed that obj1 and obj2
   are ndarrays of the same shape and size.
*/
iter1 = (PyArrayIterObject *)PyArray_IterNew(obj1);
if (iter1 == NULL) goto fail;
iter2 = (PyArrayIterObject *)PyArray_IterNew(obj2);
if (iter2 == NULL) goto fail;  /* assume iter1 is DECREF'd at fail */
while (iter2-&gt;index &lt; iter2-&gt;size)  {
    /* process with iter1-&gt;dataptr and iter2-&gt;dataptr */

While this covers a large majority of possible use cases, it is conceivable that a user may have a need for an additional data-type. There is some support for adding an additional data-type into the NumPy system. This additional data- type will behave much like a regular data-type except ufuncs must have 1-d loops registered to handle it separately. Also checking for whether or not other data-types can be cast “safely” to and from this new type or not will always return “can cast” unless you also register which types your new data-type can be cast to and from.</p> <p>The NumPy source code includes an example of a custom data-type as part of its test suite. The file <code>_rational_tests.c.src</code> in the source code directory <code>numpy/numpy/core/src/umath/</code> contains an implementation of a data-type that represents a rational number as the ratio of two 32 bit integers.</p> <section id="adding-the-new-data-type"> <h3 id="index-3">Adding the new data-type</h3> <p>To begin to make use of the new data-type, you need to first define a new Python type to hold the scalars of your new data-type. It should be acceptable to inherit from one of the array scalars if your new type has a binary compatible layout. This will allow your new data type to have the methods and attributes of array scalars. New data- types must have a fixed memory size (if you want to define a data-type that needs a flexible representation, like a variable-precision number, then use a pointer to the object as the data-type). The memory layout of the object structure for the new Python type must be PyObject_HEAD followed by the fixed-size memory needed for the data- type. For example, a suitable structure for the new Python type is:</p> <pre data-language="c">typedef struct {
   PyObject_HEAD;
   some_data_type obval;
   /* the name can be whatever you want */
} PySomeDataTypeObject;
</pre> <p>After you have defined a new Python type object, you must then define a new <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/types-and-structures.html#c.PyArray_Descr" title="PyArray_Descr"><code>PyArray_Descr</code></a> structure whose typeobject member will contain a pointer to the data-type you’ve just defined. In addition, the required functions in the “.f” member must be defined: nonzero, copyswap, copyswapn, setitem, getitem, and cast. The more functions in the “.f” member you define, however, the more useful the new data-type will be. It is very important to initialize unused functions to NULL. This can be achieved using <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_InitArrFuncs" title="PyArray_InitArrFuncs"><code>PyArray_InitArrFuncs</code></a> (f).</p> <p>Once a new <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/types-and-structures.html#c.PyArray_Descr" title="PyArray_Descr"><code>PyArray_Descr</code></a> structure is created and filled with the needed information and useful functions you call <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_RegisterDataType" title="PyArray_RegisterDataType"><code>PyArray_RegisterDataType</code></a> (new_descr). The return value from this call is an integer providing you with a unique type_number that specifies your data-type. This type number should be stored and made available by your module so that other modules can use it to recognize your data-type (the other mechanism for finding a user-defined data-type number is to search based on the name of the type-object associated with the data-type using <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/array.html#c.PyArray_TypeNumFromName" title="PyArray_TypeNumFromName"><code>PyArray_TypeNumFromName</code></a> ).</p> </section> <section id="registering-a-casting-function"> <h3>Registering a casting function</h3> <p>You may want to allow builtin (and other user-defined) data-types to be cast automatically to your data-type.

In addition builtin data-types are not presumed to be safely castable to user-defined data-types. This situation limits the ability of user-defined data-types to participate in the coercion system used by ufuncs and other times when automatic coercion takes place in NumPy. This can be changed by registering data-types as safely castable from a particular data-type object.

This facility is one of the important reasons for basing NumPy off of the Numeric code-base which was already in C. A sub-type in C allows much more flexibility with regards to memory management. Sub-typing in C is not difficult even if you have only a rudimentary understanding of how to create new types for Python. While it is easiest to sub-type from a single parent type, sub-typing from multiple parent types is also possible. Multiple inheritance in C is generally less useful than it is in Python because a restriction on Python sub-types is that they have a binary compatible memory layout. Perhaps for this reason, it is somewhat easier to sub-type from a single parent type.</p> <p id="index-5">All C-structures corresponding to Python objects must begin with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject_HEAD" title="(in Python v3.10)"><code>PyObject_HEAD</code></a> (or <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject_VAR_HEAD" title="(in Python v3.10)"><code>PyObject_VAR_HEAD</code></a>). In the same way, any sub-type must have a C-structure that begins with exactly the same memory layout as the parent type (or all of the parent types in the case of multiple-inheritance). The reason for this is that Python may attempt to access a member of the sub-type structure as if it had the parent structure ( <em>i.e.</em> it will cast a given pointer to a pointer to the parent structure and then dereference one of it’s members). If the memory layouts are not compatible, then this attempt will cause unpredictable behavior (eventually leading to a memory violation and program crash).</p> <p>One of the elements in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject_HEAD" title="(in Python v3.10)"><code>PyObject_HEAD</code></a> is a pointer to a type-object structure. A new Python type is created by creating a new type-object structure and populating it with functions and pointers to describe the desired behavior of the type. Typically, a new C-structure is also created to contain the instance-specific information needed for each object of the type as well. For example, <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/types-and-structures.html#c.PyArray_Type" title="PyArray_Type"><code>&amp;PyArray_Type</code></a> is a pointer to the type-object table for the ndarray while a <span class="c-expr sig sig-inline c"><a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/types-and-structures.html#c.PyArrayObject" title="PyArrayObject"><span class="n">PyArrayObject</span></a><span class="p">*</span></span> variable is a pointer to a particular instance of an ndarray (one of the members of the ndarray structure is, in turn, a pointer to the type- object table <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/c-api/types-and-structures.html#c.PyArray_Type" title="PyArray_Type"><code>&amp;PyArray_Type</code></a>).

<p>Any class or type can define this method which should take an ndarray argument and return an instance of the type. It can be seen as the opposite of the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/arrays.classes.html#numpy.class.__array__" title="numpy.class.__array__"><code>__array__</code></a> method. This method is used by the ufuncs (and other NumPy functions) to allow other objects to pass through. For Python &gt;2.4, it can also be used to write a decorator that converts a function that works only with ndarrays to one that works with any type with <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/arrays.classes.html#numpy.class.__array__" title="numpy.class.__array__"><code>__array__</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/arrays.classes.html#numpy.class.__array_wrap__" title="numpy.class.__array_wrap__"><code>__array_wrap__</code></a> methods.</p> </dd>
