</pre> </section> <section id="description"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code>path</code> performs operations on paths.</p> <p>PATH arguments are taken from the command line unless standard input is connected to a pipe or a file, in which case they are read from standard input, one PATH per line. It is an error to supply PATH arguments on both the command line and on standard input.</p> <p>Arguments starting with <code>-</code> are normally interpreted as switches; <code>--</code> causes the following arguments not to be treated as switches even if they begin with <code>-</code>. Switches and required arguments are recognized only on the command line.</p> <p>When a path starts with <code>-</code>, <code>path filter</code> and <code>path normalize</code> will prepend <code>./</code> on output to avoid it being interpreted as an option otherwise, so it’s safe to pass path’s output to other commands that can handle relative paths.</p> <p>All subcommands accept a <code>-q</code> or <code>--quiet</code> switch, which suppresses the usual output but exits with the documented status. In this case these commands will quit early, without reading all of the available input.</p> <p>All subcommands also accept a <code>-Z</code> or <code>--null-out</code> switch, which makes them print output separated with NUL instead of newlines. This is for further processing, e.g. passing to another <code>path</code>, or <code>xargs -0</code>. This is not recommended when the output goes to the terminal or a command substitution.</p> <p>All subcommands also accept a <code>-z</code> or <code>--null-in</code> switch, which makes them accept arguments from stdin separated with NULL-bytes. Since Unix paths can’t contain NULL, that makes it possible to handle all possible paths and read input from e.g. <code>find -print0</code>. If arguments are given on the commandline this has no effect. This should mostly be unnecessary since <code>path</code> automatically starts splitting on NULL if one appears in the first PATH_MAX bytes, PATH_MAX being the operating system’s maximum length for a path plus a NULL byte.</p> <p>Some subcommands operate on the paths as strings and so work on nonexistent paths, while others need to access the paths themselves and so filter out nonexistent paths.</p> <p>The following subcommands are available.</p> </section> <section id="basename-subcommand"> <h2 id="cmd-path-basename">“basename” subcommand</h2> <pre data-language="shell">path basename [-z | --null-in] [-Z | --null-out] [-q | --quiet] [PATH ...]

</pre> <p><code>path filter</code> returns all of the given paths that match the given checks. In all cases, the paths need to exist, nonexistent paths are always filtered.</p> <p>The available filters are:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>-t</code> or <code>--type</code> with the options: “dir”, “file”, “link”, “block”, “char”, “fifo” and “socket”, in which case the path needs to be a directory, file, link, block device, character device, named pipe or socket, respectively.</li> <li>
<code>-d</code>, <code>-f</code> and <code>-l</code> are short for <code>--type=dir</code>, <code>--type=file</code> and <code>--type=link</code>, respectively. There are no shortcuts for the other types.</li> <li>
<code>-p</code> or <code>--perm</code> with the options: “read”, “write”, and “exec”, as well as “suid”, “sgid”, “user” (referring to the path owner) and “group” (referring to the path’s group), in which case the path needs to have all of the given permissions for the current user.</li> <li>
<code>-r</code>, <code>-w</code> and <code>-x</code> are short for <code>--perm=read</code>, <code>--perm=write</code> and <code>--perm=exec</code>, respectively. There are no shortcuts for the other permissions.</li> </ul> <p>Note that the path needs to be <em>any</em> of the given types, but have <em>all</em> of the given permissions. This is because having a path that is both writable and executable makes sense, but having a path that is both a directory and a file doesn’t. Links will count as the type of the linked-to file, so links to files count as files, links to directories count as directories.</p> <p>The filter options can either be given as multiple options, or comma-separated - <code>path filter -t dir,file</code> or <code>path filter --type dir --type file</code> are equivalent.</p> <p>With <code>--invert</code>, the meaning of the filtering is inverted - any path that wouldn’t pass (including by not existing) passes, and any path that would pass fails.</p> <p>When a path starts with <code>-</code>, <code>path filter</code> will prepend <code>./</code> to avoid it being interpreted as an option otherwise.</p> <p>It returns 0 if at least one path passed the filter.</p> <p><code>path is</code> is shorthand for <code>path filter -q</code>, i.e. just checking without producing output, see <a class="reference internal" href="#cmd-path-is"><span class="std std-ref">The is subcommand</span></a>.</p> <section id="id3"> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="shell">&gt;_ path filter /usr/bin /usr/argagagji
