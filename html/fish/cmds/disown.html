<h1 id="cmd-disown">disown - remove a process from the list of jobs</h1> <section id="synopsis"> <h2>Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="shell">disown [PID ...]
</pre> </section> <section id="description"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code>disown</code> removes the specified <a class="reference internal" href="../language.html#syntax-job-control"><span class="std std-ref">job</span></a> from the list of jobs. The job itself continues to exist, but fish does not keep track of it any longer.</p> <p>Jobs in the list of jobs are sent a hang-up signal when fish terminates, which usually causes the job to terminate; <code>disown</code> allows these processes to continue regardless.</p> <p>If no process is specified, the most recently-used job is removed (like <a class="reference internal" href="bg.html"><span class="doc">bg</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="fg.html"><span class="doc">fg</span></a>). If one or more PIDs are specified, jobs with the specified process IDs are removed from the job list. Invalid jobs are ignored and a warning is printed.</p> <p>If a job is stopped, it is sent a signal to continue running, and a warning is printed. It is not possible to use the <a class="reference internal" href="bg.html"><span class="doc">bg</span></a> builtin to continue a job once it has been disowned.</p> <p><code>disown</code> returns 0 if all specified jobs were disowned successfully, and 1 if any problems were encountered.</p> <p>The <strong>--help</strong> or <strong>-h</strong> option displays help about using this command.</p> </section> <section id="example"> <h2>Example</h2> <p><code>firefox &amp;; disown</code> will start the Firefox web browser in the background and remove it from the job list, meaning it will not be closed when the fish process is closed.</p> <p><code>disown (jobs -p)</code> removes all <a class="reference internal" href="jobs.html"><span class="doc">jobs</span></a> from the job list without terminating them.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
