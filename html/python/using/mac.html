 <span id="using-on-mac"></span><h1> Using Python on macOS</h1> <p>This document aims to give an overview of macOS-specific behavior you should know about to get started with Python on Mac computers. Python on a Mac running macOS is very similar to Python on other Unix-derived platforms, but there are some differences in installation and some features.</p> <p>There are various ways to obtain and install Python for macOS. Pre-built versions of the most recent versions of Python are available from a number of distributors. Much of this document describes use of the Pythons provided by the CPython release team for download from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org website</a>. See <a class="reference internal" href="#alternative-bundles"><span class="std std-ref">Alternative Distributions</span></a> for some other options.</p> <section id="using-python-for-macos-from-python-org"> <span id="getting-and-installing-macpython"></span><span id="getting-osx"></span><h2>
<span class="section-number">5.1. </span>Using Python for macOS from <code>python.org</code>
</h2> <section id="installation-steps"> <h3>
<span class="section-number">5.1.1. </span>Installation steps</h3> <p>For <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">current Python versions</a> (other than those in <code>security</code> status), the release team produces a <strong>Python for macOS</strong> installer package for each new release. A list of available installers is available <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/">here</a>. We recommend using the most recent supported Python version where possible. Current installers provide a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_binary">universal2 binary</a> build of Python which runs natively on all Macs (Apple Silicon and Intel) that are supported by a wide range of macOS versions, currently typically from at least <strong>macOS 10.13 High Sierra</strong> on.</p> <p>The downloaded file is a standard macOS installer package file (<code>.pkg</code>). File integrity information (checksum, size, sigstore signature, etc) for each file is included on the release download page. Installer packages and their contents are signed and notarized with <code>Python Software Foundation</code> Apple Developer ID certificates to meet <a class="reference external" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445">macOS Gatekeeper requirements</a>.</p> <p>For a default installation, double-click on the downloaded installer package file. This should launch the standard macOS Installer app and display the first of several installer windows steps.</p> <img alt="../_images/mac_installer_01_introduction.png" src="https://docs.python.org/3.13/_images/mac_installer_01_introduction.png"> <p>Clicking on the <strong>Continue</strong> button brings up the <strong>Read Me</strong> for this installer. Besides other important information, the <strong>Read Me</strong> documents which Python version is going to be installed and on what versions of macOS it is supported. You may need to scroll through to read the whole file. By default, this <strong>Read Me</strong> will also be installed in <code>/Applications/Python 3.13/</code> and available to read anytime.</p> <img alt="../_images/mac_installer_02_readme.png" src="https://docs.python.org/3.13/_images/mac_installer_02_readme.png"> <p>Clicking on <strong>Continue</strong> proceeds to display the license for Python and for other included software. You will then need to <strong>Agree</strong> to the license terms before proceeding to the next step. This license file will also be installed and available to be read later.</p> <img alt="../_images/mac_installer_03_license.png" src="https://docs.python.org/3.13/_images/mac_installer_03_license.png"> <p>After the license terms are accepted, the next step is the <strong>Installation Type</strong> display. For most uses, the standard set of installation operations is appropriate.</p> <img alt="../_images/mac_installer_04_installation_type.png" src="https://docs.python.org/3.13/_images/mac_installer_04_installation_type.png"> <p>By pressing the <strong>Customize</strong> button, you can choose to omit or select certain package components of the installer. Click on each package name to see a description of what it installs. To also install support for the optional experimental free-threaded feature, see <a class="reference internal" href="#install-freethreaded-macos"><span class="std std-ref">Installing Free-threaded Binaries</span></a>.</p> <img alt="../_images/mac_installer_05_custom_install.png" src="https://docs.python.org/3.13/_images/mac_installer_05_custom_install.png"> <p>In either case, clicking <strong>Install</strong> will begin the install process by asking permission to install new software. A macOS user name with <code>Administrator</code> privilege is needed as the installed Python will be available to all users of the Mac.</p> <p>When the installation is complete, the <strong>Summary</strong> window will appear.</p> <img alt="../_images/mac_installer_06_summary.png" src="https://docs.python.org/3.13/_images/mac_installer_06_summary.png"> <p>Double-click on the <strong class="command">Install Certificates.command</strong> icon or file in the <code>/Applications/Python 3.13/</code> window to complete the installation.</p> <img alt="../_images/mac_installer_07_applications.png" src="https://docs.python.org/3.13/_images/mac_installer_07_applications.png"> <p>This will open a temporary <strong class="program">Terminal</strong> shell window that will use the new Python to download and install SSL root certificates for its use.</p> <img alt="../_images/mac_installer_08_install_certificates.png" src="https://docs.python.org/3.13/_images/mac_installer_08_install_certificates.png"> <p>If <code>Successfully installed certifi</code> and <code>update complete</code> appears in the terminal window, the installation is complete. Close this terminal window and the installer window.</p> <p>A default install will include:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>A <code>Python 3.13</code> folder in your <code>Applications</code> folder. In here you find <strong class="program">IDLE</strong>, the development environment that is a standard part of official Python distributions; and <strong class="program">Python Launcher</strong>, which handles double-clicking Python scripts from the macOS <a class="reference external" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732">Finder</a>.</li> <li>A framework <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework</code>, which includes the Python executable and libraries. The installer adds this location to your shell path. To uninstall Python, you can remove these three things. Symlinks to the Python executable are placed in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>.</li> </ul> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Recent versions of macOS include a <strong class="command">python3</strong> command in <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> that links to a usually older and incomplete version of Python provided by and for use by the Apple development tools, <strong class="program">Xcode</strong> or the <strong class="program">Command Line Tools for Xcode</strong>. You should never modify or attempt to delete this installation, as it is Apple-controlled and is used by Apple-provided or third-party software. If you choose to install a newer Python version from <code>python.org</code>, you will have two different but functional Python installations on your computer that can co-exist. The default installer options should ensure that its <strong class="command">python3</strong> will be used instead of the system <strong class="command">python3</strong>.</p> </div> </section> <section id="how-to-run-a-python-script"> <h3>
<span class="section-number">5.1.2. </span>How to run a Python script</h3> <p>There are two ways to invoke the Python interpreter. If you are familiar with using a Unix shell in a terminal window, you can invoke <code>python3.13</code> or <code>python3</code> optionally followed by one or more command line options (described in <a class="reference internal" href="cmdline.html#using-on-general"><span class="std std-ref">Command line and environment</span></a>). The Python tutorial also has a useful section on <a class="reference internal" href="../tutorial/appendix.html#tut-interac"><span class="std std-ref">using Python interactively from a shell</span></a>.</p> <p>You can also invoke the interpreter through an integrated development environment. <a class="reference internal" href="../library/idle.html#idle"><span class="std std-ref">IDLE</span></a> is a basic editor and interpreter environment which is included with the standard distribution of Python. <strong class="program">IDLE</strong> includes a Help menu that allows you to access Python documentation. If you are completely new to Python, you can read the tutorial introduction in that document.</p> <p>There are many other editors and IDEs available, see <a class="reference internal" href="editors.html#editors"><span class="std std-ref">Editors and IDEs</span></a> for more information.</p> <p>To run a Python script file from the terminal window, you can invoke the interpreter with the name of the script file:</p>  <p><code>python3.13</code> <code>myscript.py</code></p>  <p>To run your script from the Finder, you can either:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Drag it to <strong class="program">Python Launcher</strong>.</li> <li>Select <strong class="program">Python Launcher</strong> as the default application to open your script (or any <code>.py</code> script) through the Finder Info window and double-click it. <strong class="program">Python Launcher</strong> has various preferences to control how your script is launched. Option-dragging allows you to change these for one invocation, or use its <code>Preferences</code> menu to change things globally.</li> </ul> <p>Be aware that running the script directly from the macOS Finder might produce different results than when running from a terminal window as the script will not be run in the usual shell environment including any setting of environment variables in shell profiles. And, as with any other script or program, be certain of what you are about to run.</p> </section> </section> <section id="alternative-distributions"> <span id="alternative-bundles"></span><h2>

<span class="section-number">5.5.1. </span>Installing Free-threaded Binaries</h3> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">Added in version 3.13: </span>(Experimental)</p> </div> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Everything described in this section is considered experimental, and should be expected to change in future releases.</p> </div> <p>The <code>python.org</code> <a class="reference internal" href="#getting-and-installing-macpython"><span class="std std-ref">Python for macOS</span></a> installer package can optionally install an additional build of Python 3.13 that supports <span class="target" id="index-0"></span><a class="pep reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/"><strong>PEP 703</strong></a>, the experimental free-threading feature (running with the <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock"><span class="xref std std-term">global interpreter lock</span></a> disabled). Check the release page on <code>python.org</code> for possible updated information.</p> <p>Because this feature is still considered experimental, the support for it is not installed by default. It is packaged as a separate install option, available by clicking the <strong>Customize</strong> button on the <strong>Installation Type</strong> step of the installer as described above.</p> <img alt="../_images/mac_installer_09_custom_install_free_threaded.png" src="https://docs.python.org/3.13/_images/mac_installer_09_custom_install_free_threaded.png"> <p>If the box next to the <strong>Free-threaded Python</strong> package name is checked, a separate <code>PythonT.framework</code> will also be installed alongside the normal <code>Python.framework</code> in <code>/Library/Frameworks</code>. This configuration allows a free-threaded Python 3.13 build to co-exist on your system with a traditional (GIL only) Python 3.13 build with minimal risk while installing or testing. This installation layout is itself experimental and is subject to change in future releases.</p> <p>Known cautions and limitations:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>UNIX command-line tools</strong> package, which is selected by default, will install links in <code>/usr/local/bin</code> for <code>python3.13t</code>, the free-threaded interpreter, and <code>python3.13t-config</code>, a configuration utility which may be useful for package builders. Since <code>/usr/local/bin</code> is typically included in your shell <code>PATH</code>, in most cases no changes to your <code>PATH</code> environment variables should be needed to use <code>python3.13t</code>.</li> <li>For this release, the <strong>Shell profile updater</strong> package and the <code>Update Shell Profile.command</code> in <code>/Applications/Python 3.13/</code> do not support the free-threaded package.</li> <li>
<p>The free-threaded build and the traditional build have separate search paths and separate <code>site-packages</code> directories so, by default, if you need a package available in both builds, it may need to be installed in both. The free-threaded package will install a separate instance of <strong class="program">pip</strong> for use with <code>python3.13t</code>.</p> <ul> <li>
<p>To install a package using <strong class="command">pip</strong> without a <strong class="command">venv</strong>:</p>  <p><code>python3.13t</code> <code>-m pip install &lt;package_name&gt;</code></p>  </li> </ul> </li> <li>
<p>When working with multiple Python environments, it is usually safest and easiest to <a class="reference internal" href="../tutorial/venv.html#tut-venv"><span class="std std-ref">create and use virtual environments</span></a>. This can avoid possible command name conflicts and confusion about which Python is in use:</p>  <p><code>python3.13t</code> <code>-m venv &lt;venv_name&gt;</code></p>  <p>then <strong class="command">activate</strong>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>To run a free-threaded version of IDLE:</p>  <p><code>python3.13t</code> <code>-m idlelib</code></p>  </li> <li>The interpreters in both builds respond to the same <a class="reference internal" href="cmdline.html#using-on-envvars"><span class="std std-ref">PYTHON environment variables</span></a> which may have unexpected results, for example, if you have <code>PYTHONPATH</code> set in a shell profile. If necessary, there are <a class="reference internal" href="cmdline.html#using-on-interface-options"><span class="std std-ref">command line options</span></a> like <code>-E</code> to ignore these environment variables.</li> <li>The free-threaded build links to the third-party shared libraries, such as <code>OpenSSL</code> and <code>Tk</code>, installed in the traditional framework. This means that both builds also share one set of trust certificates as installed by the <strong class="command">Install Certificates.command</strong> script, thus it only needs to be run once.</li> <li>
<p>If you cannot depend on the link in <code>/usr/local/bin</code> pointing to the <code>python.org</code> free-threaded <code>python3.13t</code> (for example, if you want to install your own version there or some other distribution does), you can explicitly set your shell <code>PATH</code> environment variable to include the <code>PythonT</code> framework <code>bin</code> directory:</p> <pre data-language="sh">export PATH="/Library/Frameworks/PythonT.framework/Versions/3.13/bin":"$PATH"
</pre> <p>The traditional framework installation by default does something similar, except for <code>Python.framework</code>. Be aware that having both framework <code>bin</code> directories in <code>PATH</code> can lead to confusion if there are duplicate names like <code>python3.13</code> in both; which one is actually used depends on the order they appear in <code>PATH</code>. The <code>which python3.x</code> or <code>which python3.xt</code> commands can show which path is being used. Using virtual environments can help avoid such ambiguities. Another option might be to create a shell <strong class="command">alias</strong> to the desired interpreter, like:</p> <pre data-language="sh">alias py3.13="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin/python3.13"
alias py3.13t="/Library/Frameworks/PythonT.framework/Versions/3.13/bin/python3.13t"
</pre> </li> </ul> </section> <section id="installing-using-the-command-line"> <h3>
<span class="section-number">5.5.2. </span>Installing using the command line</h3> <p>If you want to use automation to install the <code>python.org</code> installer package (rather than by using the familiar macOS <strong class="program">Installer</strong> GUI app), the macOS command line <strong class="command">installer</strong> utility lets you select non-default options, too. If you are not familiar with <strong class="command">installer</strong>, it can be somewhat cryptic (see <strong class="command">man installer</strong> for more information). As an example, the following shell snippet shows one way to do it, using the <code>3.13.0b2</code> release and selecting the free-threaded interpreter option:</p> <pre data-language="sh">RELEASE="python-3.13.0b2-macos11.pkg"

# download installer pkg
curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.0/${RELEASE}

# create installer choicechanges to customize the install:
#    enable the PythonTFramework-3.13 package
#    while accepting the other defaults (install all other packages)
