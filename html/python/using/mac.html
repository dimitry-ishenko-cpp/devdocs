<span class="section-number">5.1. </span>Getting and Installing Python</h2> <p>macOS used to come with Python 2.7 pre-installed between versions 10.8 and <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12_3-release-notes#Python">12.3</a>. You are invited to install the most recent version of Python 3 from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/">Python website</a>. A current “universal2 binary” build of Python, which runs natively on the Mac’s new Apple Silicon and legacy Intel processors, is available there.</p> <p>What you get after installing is a number of things:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>A <code>Python 3.13</code> folder in your <code>Applications</code> folder. In here you find IDLE, the development environment that is a standard part of official Python distributions; and <strong class="program">Python Launcher</strong>, which handles double-clicking Python scripts from the Finder.</li> <li>A framework <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework</code>, which includes the Python executable and libraries. The installer adds this location to your shell path. To uninstall Python, you can remove these three things. A symlink to the Python executable is placed in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>.</li> </ul> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>On macOS 10.8-12.3, the Apple-provided build of Python is installed in <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework</code> and <code>/usr/bin/python</code>, respectively. You should never modify or delete these, as they are Apple-controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party software. Remember that if you choose to install a newer Python version from python.org, you will have two different but functional Python installations on your computer, so it will be important that your paths and usages are consistent with what you want to do.</p> </div> <p>IDLE includes a Help menu that allows you to access Python documentation. If you are completely new to Python you should start reading the tutorial introduction in that document.</p> <p>If you are familiar with Python on other Unix platforms you should read the section on running Python scripts from the Unix shell.</p> <section id="how-to-run-a-python-script"> <h3>
<span class="section-number">5.1.1. </span>How to run a Python script</h3> <p>Your best way to get started with Python on macOS is through the IDLE integrated development environment; see section <a class="reference internal" href="#ide"><span class="std std-ref">The IDE</span></a> and use the Help menu when the IDE is running.</p> <p>If you want to run Python scripts from the Terminal window command line or from the Finder you first need an editor to create your script. macOS comes with a number of standard Unix command line editors, <strong class="program">vim</strong> <strong class="program">nano</strong> among them. If you want a more Mac-like editor, <strong class="program">BBEdit</strong> from Bare Bones Software (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html</a>) are good choices, as is <strong class="program">TextMate</strong> (see <a class="reference external" href="https://macromates.com">https://macromates.com</a>). Other editors include <strong class="program">MacVim</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://macvim.org">https://macvim.org</a>) and <strong class="program">Aquamacs</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://aquamacs.org">https://aquamacs.org</a>).</p> <p>To run your script from the Terminal window you must make sure that <code>/usr/local/bin</code> is in your shell search path.</p> <p>To run your script from the Finder you have two options:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Drag it to <strong class="program">Python Launcher</strong>.</li> <li>Select <strong class="program">Python Launcher</strong> as the default application to open your script (or any <code>.py</code> script) through the finder Info window and double-click it. <strong class="program">Python Launcher</strong> has various preferences to control how your script is launched. Option-dragging allows you to change these for one invocation, or use its Preferences menu to change things globally.</li> </ul> </section> <section id="running-scripts-with-a-gui"> <span id="osx-gui-scripts"></span><h3>
<span class="section-number">5.1.2. </span>Running scripts with a GUI</h3> <p>With older versions of Python, there is one macOS quirk that you need to be aware of: programs that talk to the Aqua window manager (in other words, anything that has a GUI) need to be run in a special way. Use <strong class="program">pythonw</strong> instead of <strong class="program">python</strong> to start such scripts.</p> <p>With Python 3.9, you can use either <strong class="program">python</strong> or <strong class="program">pythonw</strong>.</p> </section> <section id="configuration"> <h3>
<span class="section-number">5.1.3. </span>Configuration</h3> <p>Python on macOS honors all standard Unix environment variables such as <span class="target" id="index-0"></span><a class="reference internal" href="cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH"><code>PYTHONPATH</code></a>, but setting these variables for programs started from the Finder is non-standard as the Finder does not read your <code>.profile</code> or <code>.cshrc</code> at startup. You need to create a file <code>~/.MacOSX/environment.plist</code>. See Apple’s <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1067/_index.html">Technical Q&amp;A QA1067</a> for details.</p> <p>For more information on installation Python packages, see section <a class="reference internal" href="#mac-package-manager"><span class="std std-ref">Installing Additional Python Packages</span></a>.</p> </section> </section> <section id="the-ide"> <span id="ide"></span><h2>
<span class="section-number">5.2. </span>The IDE</h2> <p>Python ships with the standard IDLE development environment.

<span class="section-number">5.4. </span>GUI Programming</h2> <p>There are several options for building GUI applications on the Mac with Python.</p> <p><em>PyObjC</em> is a Python binding to Apple’s Objective-C/Cocoa framework, which is the foundation of most modern Mac development. Information on PyObjC is available from <a class="extlink-pypi reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/pyobjc/">pyobjc</a>.</p> <p>The standard Python GUI toolkit is <a class="reference internal" href="../library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter" title="tkinter: Interface to Tcl/Tk for graphical user interfaces"><code>tkinter</code></a>, based on the cross-platform Tk toolkit (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tcl.tk">https://www.tcl.tk</a>). An Aqua-native version of Tk is bundled with macOS by Apple, and the latest version can be downloaded and installed from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.activestate.com">https://www.activestate.com</a>; it can also be built from source.</p> <p>A number of alternative macOS GUI toolkits are available:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>

<span class="section-number">5.5. </span>Distributing Python Applications</h2> <p>A range of tools exist for converting your Python code into a standalone distributable application:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<a class="extlink-pypi reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/py2app/">py2app</a>: Supports creating macOS <code>.app</code> bundles from a Python project.</li> <li>

<span class="section-number">5.5.1. </span>App Store Compliance</h3> <p>Apps submitted for distribution through the macOS App Store must pass Apple’s app review process. This process includes a set of automated validation rules that inspect the submitted application bundle for problematic code.</p> <p>The Python standard library contains some code that is known to violate these automated rules. While these violations appear to be false positives, Apple’s review rules cannot be challenged. Therefore, it is necessary to modify the Python standard library for an app to pass App Store review.</p> <p>The Python source tree contains <a class="extlink-source reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Mac/Resources/app-store-compliance.patch">a patch file</a> that will remove all code that is known to cause issues with the App Store review process. This patch is applied automatically when CPython is configured with the <a class="reference internal" href="configure.html#cmdoption-with-app-store-compliance"><code>--with-app-store-compliance</code></a> option.</p> <p>This patch is not normally required to use CPython on a Mac; nor is it required if you are distributing an app <em>outside</em> the macOS App Store. It is <em>only</em> required if you are using the macOS App Store as a distribution channel.</p> </section> </section> <section id="other-resources"> <h2>
