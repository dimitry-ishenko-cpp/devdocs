 <span id="freethreading-python-howto"></span><h1>Python experimental support for free threading</h1> <p>Starting with the 3.13 release, CPython has experimental support for a build of Python called <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-free-threading"><span class="xref std std-term">free threading</span></a> where the <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock"><span class="xref std std-term">global interpreter lock</span></a> (GIL) is disabled. Free-threaded execution allows for full utilization of the available processing power by running threads in parallel on available CPU cores. While not all software will benefit from this automatically, programs designed with threading in mind will run faster on multi-core hardware.</p> <p><strong>The free-threaded mode is experimental</strong> and work is ongoing to improve it: expect some bugs and a substantial single-threaded performance hit.</p> <p>This document describes the implications of free threading for Python code. See <a class="reference internal" href="free-threading-extensions.html#freethreading-extensions-howto"><span class="std std-ref">C API Extension Support for Free Threading</span></a> for information on how to write C extensions that support the free-threaded build.</p> <div class="admonition seealso"> <p class="admonition-title">See also</p> <p><span class="target" id="index-0"></span><a class="pep reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/"><strong>PEP 703</strong></a> – Making the Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython for an overall description of free-threaded Python.</p> </div> <section id="installation"> <h2>Installation</h2> <p>Starting with Python 3.13, the official macOS and Windows installers optionally support installing free-threaded Python binaries. The installers are available at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>.</p> <p>For information on other platforms, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://py-free-threading.github.io/installing_cpython/">Installing a Free-Threaded Python</a>, a community-maintained installation guide for installing free-threaded Python.</p> <p>When building CPython from source, the <a class="reference internal" href="../using/configure.html#cmdoption-disable-gil"><code>--disable-gil</code></a> configure option should be used to build a free-threaded Python interpreter.</p> </section> <section id="identifying-free-threaded-python"> <h2>Identifying free-threaded Python</h2> <p>To check if the current interpreter supports free-threading, <a class="reference internal" href="../using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-V"><code>python -VV</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../library/sys.html#sys.version" title="sys.version"><code>sys.version</code></a> contain “experimental free-threading build”. The new <a class="reference internal" href="../library/sys.html#sys._is_gil_enabled" title="sys._is_gil_enabled"><code>sys._is_gil_enabled()</code></a> function can be used to check whether the GIL is actually disabled in the running process.</p> <p>The <code>sysconfig.get_config_var("Py_GIL_DISABLED")</code> configuration variable can be used to determine whether the build supports free threading. If the variable is set to <code>1</code>, then the build supports free threading. This is the recommended mechanism for decisions related to the build configuration.</p> </section> <section id="the-global-interpreter-lock-in-free-threaded-python"> <h2>The global interpreter lock in free-threaded Python</h2> <p>Free-threaded builds of CPython support optionally running with the GIL enabled at runtime using the environment variable <span class="target" id="index-1"></span><a class="reference internal" href="../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_GIL"><code>PYTHON_GIL</code></a> or the command-line option <a class="reference internal" href="../using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X"><code>-X gil</code></a>.</p> <p>The GIL may also automatically be enabled when importing a C-API extension module that is not explicitly marked as supporting free threading. A warning will be printed in this case.</p> <p>In addition to individual package documentation, the following websites track the status of popular packages support for free threading:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://py-free-threading.github.io/tracking/">https://py-free-threading.github.io/tracking/</a></li> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://hugovk.github.io/free-threaded-wheels/">https://hugovk.github.io/free-threaded-wheels/</a></li> </ul> </section> <section id="thread-safety"> <h2>Thread safety</h2> <p>The free-threaded build of CPython aims to provide similar thread-safety behavior at the Python level to the default GIL-enabled build. Built-in types like <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#dict" title="dict"><code>dict</code></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#list" title="list"><code>list</code></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#set" title="set"><code>set</code></a> use internal locks to protect against concurrent modifications in ways that behave similarly to the GIL. However, Python has not historically guaranteed specific behavior for concurrent modifications to these built-in types, so this should be treated as a description of the current implementation, not a guarantee of current or future behavior.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>It’s recommended to use the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/threading.html#threading.Lock" title="threading.Lock"><code>threading.Lock</code></a> or other synchronization primitives instead of relying on the internal locks of built-in types, when possible.</p> </div> </section> <section id="known-limitations"> <h2>Known limitations</h2> <p>This section describes known limitations of the free-threaded CPython build.</p> <section id="immortalization"> <h3>Immortalization</h3> <p>The free-threaded build of the 3.13 release makes some objects <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-immortal"><span class="xref std std-term">immortal</span></a>. Immortal objects are not deallocated and have reference counts that are never modified. This is done to avoid reference count contention that would prevent efficient multi-threaded scaling.</p> <p>An object will be made immortal when a new thread is started for the first time after the main thread is running. The following objects are immortalized:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/datamodel.html#user-defined-funcs"><span class="std std-ref">function</span></a> objects declared at the module level</li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/datamodel.html#instance-methods"><span class="std std-ref">method</span></a> descriptors</li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/datamodel.html#code-objects"><span class="std std-ref">code</span></a> objects</li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-module"><span class="xref std std-term">module</span></a> objects and their dictionaries</li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/datamodel.html#classes"><span class="std std-ref">classes</span></a> (type objects)</li> </ul> <p>Because immortal objects are never deallocated, applications that create many objects of these types may see increased memory usage. This is expected to be addressed in the 3.14 release.</p> <p>Additionally, numeric and string literals in the code as well as strings returned by <a class="reference internal" href="../library/sys.html#sys.intern" title="sys.intern"><code>sys.intern()</code></a> are also immortalized. This behavior is expected to remain in the 3.14 free-threaded build.</p> </section> <section id="frame-objects"> <h3>Frame objects</h3> <p>It is not safe to access <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects"><span class="std std-ref">frame</span></a> objects from other threads and doing so may cause your program to crash . This means that <a class="reference internal" href="../library/sys.html#sys._current_frames" title="sys._current_frames"><code>sys._current_frames()</code></a> is generally not safe to use in a free-threaded build. Functions like <a class="reference internal" href="../library/inspect.html#inspect.currentframe" title="inspect.currentframe"><code>inspect.currentframe()</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../library/sys.html#sys._getframe" title="sys._getframe"><code>sys._getframe()</code></a> are generally safe as long as the resulting frame object is not passed to another thread.</p> </section> <section id="iterators"> <h3>Iterators</h3> <p>Sharing the same iterator object between multiple threads is generally not safe and threads may see duplicate or missing elements when iterating or crash the interpreter.</p> </section> <section id="single-threaded-performance"> <h3>Single-threaded performance</h3> <p>The free-threaded build has additional overhead when executing Python code compared to the default GIL-enabled build. In 3.13, this overhead is about 40% on the <a class="reference external" href="https://pyperformance.readthedocs.io/">pyperformance</a> suite. Programs that spend most of their time in C extensions or I/O will see less of an impact. The largest impact is because the specializing adaptive interpreter (<span class="target" id="index-2"></span><a class="pep reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0659/"><strong>PEP 659</strong></a>) is disabled in the free-threaded build. We expect to re-enable it in a thread-safe way in the 3.14 release. This overhead is expected to be reduced in upcoming Python release. We are aiming for an overhead of 10% or less on the pyperformance suite compared to the default GIL-enabled build.</p> </section> </section> <div class="_attribution">
