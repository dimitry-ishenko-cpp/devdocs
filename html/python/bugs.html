 <span id="reporting-bugs"></span><h1>Dealing with Bugs</h1> <p>Python is a mature programming language which has established a reputation for stability. In order to maintain this reputation, the developers would like to know of any deficiencies you find in Python.</p> <p>It can be sometimes faster to fix bugs yourself and contribute patches to Python as it streamlines the process and involves less people.

The GitHub issues tracker offers a web form which allows pertinent information to be entered and submitted to the developers.</p> <p>The first step in filing a report is to determine whether the problem has already been reported. The advantage in doing so, aside from saving the developers’ time, is that you learn what has been done to fix it; it may be that the problem has already been fixed for the next release, or additional information is needed (in which case you are welcome to provide it if you can!). To do this, search the tracker using the search box at the top of the page.</p> <p>If the problem you’re reporting is not already in the list, log in to GitHub. If you don’t already have a GitHub account, create a new account using the “Sign up” link. It is not possible to submit a bug report anonymously.</p> <p>Being now logged in, you can submit an issue. Click on the “New issue” button in the top bar to report a new issue.</p> <p>The submission form has two fields, “Title” and “Comment”.</p> <p>For the “Title” field, enter a <em>very</em> short description of the problem; fewer than ten words is good.</p> <p>In the “Comment” field, describe the problem in detail, including what you expected to happen and what did happen. Be sure to include whether any extension modules were involved, and what hardware and software platform you were using (including version information as appropriate).</p> <p>Each issue report will be reviewed by a developer who will determine what needs to be done to correct the problem. You will receive an update each time an action is taken on the issue.</p> <div class="admonition seealso"> <p class="admonition-title">See also</p> <dl class="simple"> <dt><a class="reference external" href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report Bugs Effectively</a></dt>
