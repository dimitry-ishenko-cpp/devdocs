<code>pip</code> is the preferred installer program. Starting with Python 3.4, it is included by default with the Python binary installers.</li> <li>A <em>virtual environment</em> is a semi-isolated Python environment that allows packages to be installed for use by a particular application, rather than being installed system wide.</li> <li>
<code>venv</code> is the standard tool for creating virtual environments, and has been part of Python since Python 3.3. Starting with Python 3.4, it defaults to installing <code>pip</code> into all created virtual environments.</li> <li>
<code>virtualenv</code> is a third party alternative (and predecessor) to <code>venv</code>. It allows virtual environments to be used on versions of Python prior to 3.4, which either don’t provide <code>venv</code> at all, or aren’t able to automatically install <code>pip</code> into created environments.</li> <li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">Python Package Index</a> is a public repository of open source licensed packages made available for use by other Python users.</li> <li>the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypa.io/">Python Packaging Authority</a> is the group of developers and documentation authors responsible for the maintenance and evolution of the standard packaging tools and the associated metadata and file format standards. They maintain a variety of tools, documentation, and issue trackers on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa">GitHub</a>.</li> <li>
<code>distutils</code> is the original build and distribution system first added to the Python standard library in 1998. While direct use of <code>distutils</code> is being phased out, it still laid the foundation for the current packaging and distribution infrastructure, and it not only remains part of the standard library, but its name lives on in other ways (such as the name of the mailing list used to coordinate Python packaging standards development).</li> </ul> <div class="versionchanged"> <p><span class="versionmodified changed">Changed in version 3.5: </span>The use of <code>venv</code> is now recommended for creating virtual environments.</p> </div> <div class="admonition seealso"> <p class="admonition-title">See also</p> <p><a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/installing/#creating-virtual-environments">Python Packaging User Guide: Creating and using virtual environments</a></p> </div> </section> <section id="basic-usage"> <h2>Basic usage</h2> <p>The standard packaging tools are all designed to be used from the command line.</p> <p>The following command will install the latest version of a module and its dependencies from the Python Package Index:</p> <pre data-language="none">python -m pip install SomePackage
</pre> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>For POSIX users (including macOS and Linux users), the examples in this guide assume the use of a <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-virtual-environment"><span class="xref std std-term">virtual environment</span></a>.</p> <p>For Windows users, the examples in this guide assume that the option to adjust the system PATH environment variable was selected when installing Python.</p> </div> <p>It’s also possible to specify an exact or minimum version directly on the command line. When using comparator operators such as <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code> or some other special character which get interpreted by shell, the package name and the version should be enclosed within double quotes:</p> <pre data-language="none">python -m pip install SomePackage==1.0.4    # specific version
python -m pip install "SomePackage&gt;=1.0.4"  # minimum version
</pre> <p>Normally, if a suitable module is already installed, attempting to install it again will have no effect. Upgrading existing modules must be requested explicitly:</p> <pre data-language="none">python -m pip install --upgrade SomePackage
