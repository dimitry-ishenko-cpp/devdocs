This is probably the easiest to install (since it comes included with most <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">binary distributions</a> of Python) and use. For more info about Tk, including pointers to the source, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tcl.tk">Tcl/Tk home page</a>. Tcl/Tk is fully portable to the macOS, Windows, and Unix platforms.</p> <p>Depending on what platform(s) you are aiming at, there are also several alternatives. A <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming#Cross-Platform_Frameworks">list of cross-platform</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming#Platform-specific_Frameworks">platform-specific</a> GUI frameworks can be found on the python wiki.</p> </section> <section id="tkinter-questions"> <h2>Tkinter questions</h2> <section id="how-do-i-freeze-tkinter-applications"> <h3>How do I freeze Tkinter applications?</h3> <p>Freeze is a tool to create stand-alone applications. When freezing Tkinter applications, the applications will not be truly stand-alone, as the application will still need the Tcl and Tk libraries.</p> <p>One solution is to ship the application with the Tcl and Tk libraries, and point to them at run-time using the <code>TCL_LIBRARY</code> and <code>TK_LIBRARY</code> environment variables.</p> <p>Various third-party freeze libraries such as py2exe and cx_Freeze have handling for Tkinter applications built-in.</p> </section> <section id="can-i-have-tk-events-handled-while-waiting-for-i-o"> <h3>Can I have Tk events handled while waiting for I/O?</h3> <p>On platforms other than Windows, yes, and you don’t even need threads! But you’ll have to restructure your I/O code a bit. Tk has the equivalent of Xt’s <code>XtAddInput()</code> call, which allows you to register a callback function which will be called from the Tk mainloop when I/O is possible on a file descriptor. See <a class="reference internal" href="../library/tkinter.html#tkinter-file-handlers"><span class="std std-ref">File Handlers</span></a>.</p> </section> <section id="i-can-t-get-key-bindings-to-work-in-tkinter-why"> <h3>I can’t get key bindings to work in Tkinter: why?</h3> <p>An often-heard complaint is that event handlers <a class="reference internal" href="../library/tkinter.html#bindings-and-events"><span class="std std-ref">bound</span></a> to events with the <code>bind()</code> method don’t get handled even when the appropriate key is pressed.</p> <p>The most common cause is that the widget to which the binding applies doesn’t have “keyboard focus”. Check out the Tk documentation for the focus command. Usually a widget is given the keyboard focus by clicking in it (but not for labels; see the takefocus option).</p> </section> </section> <div class="_attribution">
