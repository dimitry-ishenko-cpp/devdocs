 <span id="tut-whatnow"></span><h1> What Now?</h1> <p>Reading this tutorial has probably reinforced your interest in using Python — you should be eager to apply Python to solving your real-world problems. Where should you go to learn more?</p> <p>This tutorial is part of Python’s documentation set. Some other documents in the set are:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../library/index.html#library-index"><span class="std std-ref">The Python Standard Library</span></a>:</p> <p>You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though terse) reference material about types, functions, and the modules in the standard library. The standard Python distribution includes a <em>lot</em> of additional code. There are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, generate random numbers, parse command-line options, compress data, and many other tasks. Skimming through the Library Reference will give you an idea of what’s available.</p> </li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="../installing/index.html#installing-index"><span class="std std-ref">Installing Python Modules</span></a> explains how to install additional modules written by other Python users.</li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/index.html#reference-index"><span class="std std-ref">The Python Language Reference</span></a>: A detailed explanation of Python’s syntax and semantics. It’s heavy reading, but is useful as a complete guide to the language itself.</li> </ul> <p>More Python resources:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a>: The major Python web site. It contains code, documentation, and pointers to Python-related pages around the web.</li> <li>

<a class="reference external" href="https://scipy.org">https://scipy.org</a>: The Scientific Python project includes modules for fast array computations and manipulations plus a host of packages for such things as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, non-linear solvers, random number distributions, statistical analysis and the like.</li> </ul> <p>For Python-related questions and problem reports, you can post to the newsgroup <em class="newsgroup">comp.lang.python</em>, or send them to the mailing list at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:python-list%40python.org.html">python-list<span>@</span>python<span>.</span>org</a>. The newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed, so messages posted to one will automatically be forwarded to the other. There are hundreds of postings a day, asking (and answering) questions, suggesting new features, and announcing new modules. Mailing list archives are available at <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/</a>.</p> <p>Before posting, be sure to check the list of <a class="reference internal" href="../faq/index.html#faq-index"><span class="std std-ref">Frequently Asked Questions</span></a> (also called the FAQ). The FAQ answers many of the questions that come up again and again, and may already contain the solution for your problem.</p> <h4 class="rubric">Footnotes</h4> <aside class="footnote-list brackets"> <aside class="footnote brackets" id="id2" role="doc-footnote"> <span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id1">1</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span> <p>“Cheese Shop” is a Monty Python’s sketch: a customer enters a cheese shop, but whatever cheese he asks for, the clerk says it’s missing.</p> </aside> </aside> <div class="_attribution">
