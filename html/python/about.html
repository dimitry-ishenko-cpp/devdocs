 <h1>About these documents</h1> <p>These documents are generated from <a class="reference external" href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> sources by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a>, a document processor specifically written for the Python documentation.</p> <p>Development of the documentation and its toolchain is an entirely volunteer effort, just like Python itself. If you want to contribute, please take a look at the <a class="reference internal" href="bugs.html#reporting-bugs"><span class="std std-ref">Dealing with Bugs</span></a> page for information on how to do so. New volunteers are always welcome!</p> <p>Many thanks go to:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Fred L. Drake, Jr., the creator of the original Python documentation toolset and writer of much of the content;</li> <li>the <a class="reference external" href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/">Docutils</a> project for creating reStructuredText and the Docutils suite;</li> <li>Fredrik Lundh for his Alternative Python Reference project from which Sphinx got many good ideas.</li> </ul> <section id="contributors-to-the-python-documentation"> <h2>Contributors to the Python Documentation</h2> <p>Many people have contributed to the Python language, the Python standard library, and the Python documentation. See <a class="extlink-source reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Misc/ACKS">Misc/ACKS</a> in the Python source distribution for a partial list of contributors.</p> <p>It is only with the input and contributions of the Python community that Python has such wonderful documentation â€“ Thank You!</p> </section> <div class="_attribution">
