Listing here does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation from the Expressjs project team.</p> </div> <p>When you run Express apps for production, it is helpful to use a <em>process manager</em> to:</p> <ul> <li>Restart the app automatically if it crashes.</li> <li>Gain insights into runtime performance and resource consumption.</li> <li>Modify settings dynamically to improve performance.</li> <li>Control clustering.</li> </ul> <p>A process manager is somewhat like an application server: it’s a “container” for applications that facilitates deployment, provides high availability, and enables you to manage the application at runtime.</p> <p>The most popular process managers for Express and other Node.js applications are:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/foreverjs/forever" target="_blank">Forever</a></strong>: A simple command-line interface tool to ensure that a script runs continuously (forever). Forever’s simple interface makes it ideal for running smaller deployments of Node.js apps and scripts.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2" target="_blank">PM2</a></strong>: A production process manager for Node.js applications that has a built-in load balancer. PM2 enables you to keep applications alive forever, reloads them without downtime, helps you to manage application logging, monitoring, and clustering.</li> <li>
<strong><a href="http://strong-pm.io/">StrongLoop Process Manager (Strong-PM)</a></strong>: A production process manager for Node.js applications with built-in load balancing, monitoring, and multi-host deployment. Includes a CLI to build, package, and deploy Node.js applications to a local or remote system.</li> <li>
<strong>SystemD</strong>: The default process manager on modern Linux distributions, that makes it simple to run a Node application as a service. For more information, see <a href="https://www.axllent.org/docs/view/nodejs-service-with-systemd/">“Run node.js service with systemd” by Ralph Slooten (@axllent)</a>.</li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
