<h1>Large Applications as Packages</h1> <p>Imagine a simple flask application structure that looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="python">/yourapplication
    yourapplication.py
    /static
        style.css
    /templates
        layout.html
        index.html
        login.html
        ...
</pre> <p>While this is fine for small applications, for larger applications it’s a good idea to use a package instead of a module. The <a class="reference internal" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/tutorial/"><span class="doc">Tutorial</span></a> is structured to use the package pattern, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/3.0.0/examples/tutorial">example code</a>.</p> <section id="simple-packages"> <h2>Simple Packages</h2> <p>To convert that into a larger one, just create a new folder <code>yourapplication</code> inside the existing one and move everything below it. Then rename <code>yourapplication.py</code> to <code>__init__.py</code>. (Make sure to delete all <code>.pyc</code> files first, otherwise things would most likely break)</p> <p>You should then end up with something like that:</p> <pre data-language="python">/yourapplication
    /yourapplication
        __init__.py
        /static
            style.css
        /templates
            layout.html
            index.html
            login.html
            ...
</pre> <p>But how do you run your application now? The naive <code>python
yourapplication/__init__.py</code> will not work. Let’s just say that Python does not want modules in packages to be the startup file. But that is not a big problem, just add a new file called <code>pyproject.toml</code> next to the inner <code>yourapplication</code> folder with the following contents:</p> <pre data-language="toml">[project]
name = "yourapplication"
dependencies = [
    "flask",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["flit_core&lt;4"]
build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"
</pre> <p>Install your application so it is importable:</p> <pre data-language="text">$ pip install -e .
</pre> <p>To use the <code>flask</code> command and run your application you need to set the <code>--app</code> option that tells Flask where to find the application instance:</p> <pre data-language="text">$ flask --app yourapplication run
</pre> <p>What did we gain from this? Now we can restructure the application a bit into multiple modules. The only thing you have to remember is the following quick checklist:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>the <code>Flask</code> application object creation has to be in the <code>__init__.py</code> file. That way each module can import it safely and the <code>__name__</code> variable will resolve to the correct package.</li> <li>all the view functions (the ones with a <a class="reference internal" href="../../api/index.html#flask.Flask.route" title="flask.Flask.route"><code>route()</code></a> decorator on top) have to be imported in the <code>__init__.py</code> file. Not the object itself, but the module it is in. Import the view module <strong>after the application object is created</strong>.</li> </ol> <p>Here’s an example <code>__init__.py</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

import yourapplication.views
</pre> <p>And this is what <code>views.py</code> would look like:</p> <pre data-language="python">from yourapplication import app

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello World!'
</pre> <p>You should then end up with something like that:</p> <pre data-language="python">/yourapplication
    pyproject.toml
    /yourapplication
        __init__.py
        views.py
        /static
            style.css
        /templates
            layout.html
            index.html
            login.html
            ...
</pre> <div class="admonition-circular-imports admonition"> <p class="admonition-title">Circular Imports</p> <p>Every Python programmer hates them, and yet we just added some: circular imports (That’s when two modules depend on each other. In this case <code>views.py</code> depends on <code>__init__.py</code>). Be advised that this is a bad idea in general but here it is actually fine. The reason for this is that we are not actually using the views in <code>__init__.py</code> and just ensuring the module is imported and we are doing that at the bottom of the file.</p> </div> </section> <section id="working-with-blueprints"> <h2>Working with Blueprints</h2> <p>If you have larger applications it’s recommended to divide them into smaller groups where each group is implemented with the help of a blueprint.
