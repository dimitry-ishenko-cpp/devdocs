</pre> </section> <section id="description"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><strong>for</strong> is a loop construct. It will perform the commands specified by <em>COMMANDS</em> multiple times. On each iteration, the local variable specified by <em>VARNAME</em> is assigned a new value from <em>VALUES</em>. If <em>VALUES</em> is empty, <em>COMMANDS</em> will not be executed at all. The <em>VARNAME</em> is visible when the loop terminates and will contain the last value assigned to it. If <em>VARNAME</em> does not already exist it will be set in the local scope. For our purposes if the <strong>for</strong> block is inside a function there must be a local variable with the same name. If the <strong>for</strong> block is not nested inside a function then global and universal variables of the same name will be used if they exist.</p> <p>Much like <a class="reference internal" href="set.html"><span class="doc">set</span></a>, <strong>for</strong> does not modify $status, but the evaluation of its subordinate commands can.</p> <p>The <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>--help</strong> option displays help about using this command.</p> </section> <section id="example"> <h2>Example</h2> <pre data-language="shell">for i in foo bar baz; echo $i; end

# would output:
foo
bar
baz
</pre> </section> <section id="notes"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>The <code>VARNAME</code> was local to the for block in releases prior to 3.0.0. This means that if you did something like this:</p> <pre data-language="shell">for var in a b c
    if break_from_loop
        break
    end
end
echo $var
</pre> <p>The last value assigned to <code>var</code> when the loop terminated would not be available outside the loop. What <code>echo $var</code> would write depended on what it was set to before the loop was run. Likely nothing.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
