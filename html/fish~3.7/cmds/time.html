<h1 id="cmd-time">time - measure how long a command or block takes</h1> <section id="synopsis"> <h2>Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="shell">time COMMAND
</pre> </section> <section id="description"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code>time</code> causes fish to measure how long a command takes and print the results afterwards. The command can be a simple fish command or a block. The results can not currently be redirected.</p> <p>For checking timing after a command has completed, check <a class="reference internal" href="../language.html#variables-special"><span class="std std-ref">$CMD_DURATION</span></a>.</p> <p>Your system most likely also has a <code>time</code> command. To use that use something like <code>command time</code>, as in <code>command time sleep 10</code>. Because it’s not inside fish, it won’t have access to fish functions and won’t be able to time blocks and such.</p> </section> <section id="how-to-interpret-the-output"> <h2>How to interpret the output</h2> <p>Time outputs a few different values. Let’s look at an example:</p> <pre data-language="shell">&gt; time string repeat -n 10000000 y\n | command grep y &gt;/dev/null

Executed in  805.98 millis    fish           external
   usr time  798.88 millis  763.88 millis   34.99 millis
   sys time  141.22 millis   40.20 millis  101.02 millis
</pre> <p>The time after “Executed in” is what is known as the “wall-clock time”. It is simply a measure of how long it took from the start of the command until it finished. Typically it is reasonably close to <a class="reference internal" href="../language.html#envvar-CMD_DURATION" id="index-0"><code>CMD_DURATION</code></a>, except for a slight skew because the two are taken at slightly different times.</p> <p>The other times are all measures of CPU time. That means they measure how long the CPU was used in this part, and they count multiple cores separately. So a program with four threads using all CPU for a second will have a time of 4 seconds.</p> <p>The “usr” time is how much CPU time was spent inside the program itself, the “sys” time is how long was spent in the kernel on behalf of that program.</p> <p>The “fish” time is how much CPU was spent in fish, the “external” time how much was spent in external commands.</p> <p>So in this example, since <code>string</code> is a builtin, everything that <code>string repeat</code> did is accounted to fish. Any time it spends doing syscalls like <code>write()</code> is accounted for in the fish/sys time.</p> <p>And <code>grep</code> here is explicitly invoked as an external command, so its times will be counted in the “external” column.</p> <p>Note that, as in this example, the CPU times can add up to more than the execution time. This is because things can be done in parallel - <code>grep</code> can match while <code>string repeat</code> writes.</p> </section> <section id="example"> <h2>Example</h2> <p>(for obvious reasons exact results will vary on your system)</p> <pre data-language="shell">&gt;_ time sleep 1s
