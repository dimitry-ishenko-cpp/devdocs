<h1 class="section" id="Options-for-Debugging-Your-Program">3.10 Options for Debugging Your Program</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Debugging-Options">      <p>To tell GCC to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost all cases you need only to add <samp class="option">-g</samp> to your other options. Some debug formats can co-exist (like DWARF with CTF) when each of them is enabled explicitly by adding the respective command line option to your other options. </p> <p>GCC allows you to use <samp class="option">-g</samp> with <samp class="option">-O</samp>. The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally be surprising: some variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it; some statements may not be executed because they compute constant results or their values are already at hand; some statements may execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops. Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized output. This makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs. </p> <p>If you are not using some other optimization option, consider using <samp class="option">-Og</samp> (see <a class="pxref" href="optimize-options.html">Options That Control Optimization</a>) with <samp class="option">-g</samp>. With no <samp class="option">-O</samp> option at all, some compiler passes that collect information useful for debugging do not run at all, so that <samp class="option">-Og</samp> may result in a better debugging experience. </p> <dl class="table"> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-g</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Produce debugging information in the operating system’s native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF). GDB can work with this debugging information. </p> <p>On most systems that use stabs format, <samp class="option">-g</samp> enables use of extra debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information makes debugging work better in GDB but probably makes other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program. If you want to control for certain whether to generate the extra information, use <samp class="option">-gvms</samp> (see below). </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-ggdb</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Produce debugging information for use by GDB. This means to use the most expressive format available (DWARF, stabs, or the native format if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all possible. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gdwarf</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-gdwarf-<var class="var">version</var></code></dt> <dd>
<p>Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported). The value of <var class="var">version</var> may be either 2, 3, 4 or 5; the default version for most targets is 5 (with the exception of VxWorks, TPF and Darwin / macOS, which default to version 2, and AIX, which defaults to version 4). </p> <p>Note that with DWARF Version 2, some ports require and always use some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables. </p> <p>Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and <samp class="option">-fvar-tracking-assignments</samp> for maximum benefit. Version 5 requires GDB 8.0 or higher. </p> <p>GCC no longer supports DWARF Version 1, which is substantially different than Version 2 and later. For historical reasons, some other DWARF-related options such as <samp class="option">-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</samp>) retain a reference to DWARF Version 2 in their names, but apply to all currently-supported versions of DWARF. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gbtf</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Request BTF debug information. BTF is the default debugging format for the eBPF target. On other targets, like x86, BTF debug information can be generated along with DWARF debug information when both of the debug formats are enabled explicitly via their respective command line options. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gctf</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-gctf<var class="var">level</var></code></dt> <dd>
<p>Request CTF debug information and use level to specify how much CTF debug information should be produced. If <samp class="option">-gctf</samp> is specified without a value for level, the default level of CTF debug information is 2. </p> <p>CTF debug information can be generated along with DWARF debug information when both of the debug formats are enabled explicitly via their respective command line options. </p> <p>Level 0 produces no CTF debug information at all. Thus, <samp class="option">-gctf0</samp> negates <samp class="option">-gctf</samp>. </p> <p>Level 1 produces CTF information for tracebacks only. This includes callsite information, but does not include type information. </p> <p>Level 2 produces type information for entities (functions, data objects etc.) at file-scope or global-scope only. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gvms</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if that is supported). This is the format used by DEBUG on Alpha/VMS systems. </p> </dd> <dt><code class="code">-gcodeview</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>Produce debugging information in CodeView debug format (if that is supported). This is the format used by Microsoft Visual C++ on Windows. </p> </dd> <dt><code class="code">-g<var class="var">level</var></code></dt> <dt><code class="code">-ggdb<var class="var">level</var></code></dt> <dt><code class="code">-gvms<var class="var">level</var></code></dt> <dd>
<p>Request debugging information and also use <var class="var">level</var> to specify how much information. The default level is 2. </p> <p>Level 0 produces no debug information at all. Thus, <samp class="option">-g0</samp> negates <samp class="option">-g</samp>. </p> <p>Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in parts of the program that you don’t plan to debug. This includes descriptions of functions and external variables, and line number tables, but no information about local variables. </p> <p>Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions present in the program. Some debuggers support macro expansion when you use <samp class="option">-g3</samp>. </p> <p>If you use multiple <samp class="option">-g</samp> options, with or without level numbers, the last such option is the one that is effective. </p> <p><samp class="option">-gdwarf</samp> does not accept a concatenated debug level, to avoid confusion with <samp class="option">-gdwarf-<var class="var">level</var></samp>. Instead use an additional <samp class="option">-g<var class="var">level</var></samp> option to change the debug level for DWARF. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-symbols</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>By default, no debug information is produced for symbols that are not actually used. Use this option if you want debug information for all symbols. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-femit-class-debug-always</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only one object file, emit it in all object files using the class. This option should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way GCC normally emits debugging information for classes because using this option increases the size of debugging information by as much as a factor of two. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-fno-merge-debug-strings</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the debugging information that are identical in different object files. Merging is not supported by all assemblers or linkers. Merging decreases the size of the debug information in the output file at the cost of increasing link processing time. Merging is enabled by default. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-fdebug-prefix-map=<var class="var">old</var>=<var class="var">new</var></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>When compiling files residing in directory <samp class="file"><var class="var">old</var></samp>, record debugging information describing them as if the files resided in directory <samp class="file"><var class="var">new</var></samp> instead. This can be used to replace a build-time path with an install-time path in the debug info. It can also be used to change an absolute path to a relative path by using <samp class="file">.</samp> for <var class="var">new</var>. This can give more reproducible builds, which are location independent, but may require an extra command to tell GDB where to find the source files. See also <samp class="option">-ffile-prefix-map</samp> and <samp class="option">-fcanon-prefix-map</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-fvar-tracking</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Run variable tracking pass. It computes where variables are stored at each position in code. Better debugging information is then generated (if the debugging information format supports this information). </p> <p>It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<samp class="option">-Os</samp>, <samp class="option">-O</samp>, <samp class="option">-O2</samp>, …), debugging information (<samp class="option">-g</samp>) and the debug info format supports it. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-fvar-tracking-assignments</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation all the way to the end, in an attempt to improve debug information while optimizing. Use of <samp class="option">-gdwarf-4</samp> is recommended along with it. </p> <p>It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which case annotations are created and maintained, but discarded at the end. By default, this flag is enabled together with <samp class="option">-fvar-tracking</samp>, except when selective scheduling is enabled. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gsplit-dwarf</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If DWARF debugging information is enabled, separate as much debugging information as possible into a separate output file with the extension <samp class="file">.dwo</samp>. This option allows the build system to avoid linking files with debug information. To be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading <samp class="file">.dwo</samp> files. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-gdwarf32</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-gdwarf64</code></dt> <dd>
<p>If DWARF debugging information is enabled, the <samp class="option">-gdwarf32</samp> selects the 32-bit DWARF format and the <samp class="option">-gdwarf64</samp> selects the 64-bit DWARF format. The default is target specific, on most targets it is <samp class="option">-gdwarf32</samp> though. The 32-bit DWARF format is smaller, but can’t support more than 2GiB of debug information in any of the DWARF debug information sections. The 64-bit DWARF format allows larger debug information and might not be well supported by all consumers yet. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gdescribe-dies</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Add description attributes to some DWARF DIEs that have no name attribute, such as artificial variables, external references and call site parameter DIEs. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gpubnames</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Generate DWARF <code class="code">.debug_pubnames</code> and <code class="code">.debug_pubtypes</code> sections. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-ggnu-pubnames</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Generate <code class="code">.debug_pubnames</code> and <code class="code">.debug_pubtypes</code> sections in a format suitable for conversion into a GDB index. This option is only useful with a linker that can produce GDB index version 7. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-fdebug-types-section</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>When using DWARF Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into their own <code class="code">.debug_types</code> section instead of making them part of the <code class="code">.debug_info</code> section. It is more efficient to put them in a separate comdat section since the linker can then remove duplicates. But not all DWARF consumers support <code class="code">.debug_types</code> sections yet and on some objects <code class="code">.debug_types</code> produces larger instead of smaller debugging information. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-grecord-gcc-switches</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-gno-record-gcc-switches</code></dt> <dd>
<p>This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging information. The options are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from the compiler version. It is enabled by default. See also <samp class="option">-frecord-gcc-switches</samp> for another way of storing compiler options into the object file. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gstrict-dwarf</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected with <samp class="option">-gdwarf-<var class="var">version</var></samp>. On most targets using non-conflicting DWARF extensions from later standard versions is allowed. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gno-strict-dwarf</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected with <samp class="option">-gdwarf-<var class="var">version</var></samp>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gas-loc-support</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Inform the compiler that the assembler supports <code class="code">.loc</code> directives. It may then use them for the assembler to generate DWARF2+ line number tables. </p> <p>This is generally desirable, because assembler-generated line-number tables are a lot more compact than those the compiler can generate itself. </p> <p>This option will be enabled by default if, at GCC configure time, the assembler was found to support such directives. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gno-as-loc-support</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Force GCC to generate DWARF2+ line number tables internally, if DWARF2+ line number tables are to be generated. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gas-locview-support</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Inform the compiler that the assembler supports <code class="code">view</code> assignment and reset assertion checking in <code class="code">.loc</code> directives. </p> <p>This option will be enabled by default if, at GCC configure time, the assembler was found to support them. </p> </dd> <dt><code class="code">-gno-as-locview-support</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Force GCC to assign view numbers internally, if <samp class="option">-gvariable-location-views</samp> are explicitly requested. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-gcolumn-info</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-gno-column-info</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Emit location column information into DWARF debugging information, rather than just file and line. This option is enabled by default. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-gstatement-frontiers</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-gno-statement-frontiers</code></dt> <dd>
<p>This option causes GCC to create markers in the internal representation at the beginning of statements, and to keep them roughly in place throughout compilation, using them to guide the output of <code class="code">is_stmt</code> markers in the line number table. This is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<samp class="option">-Os</samp>, <samp class="option">-O1</samp>, <samp class="option">-O2</samp>, …), and outputting DWARF 2 debug information at the normal level. </p> </dd> <dt>
  <span><code class="code">-gvariable-location-views</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</code></dt> <dt><code class="code">-gno-variable-location-views</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Augment variable location lists with progressive view numbers implied from the line number table. This enables debug information consumers to inspect state at certain points of the program, even if no instructions associated with the corresponding source locations are present at that point. If the assembler lacks support for view numbers in line number tables, this will cause the compiler to emit the line number table, which generally makes them somewhat less compact. The augmented line number tables and location lists are fully backward-compatible, so they can be consumed by debug information consumers that are not aware of these augmentations, but they won’t derive any benefit from them either. </p> <p>This is enabled by default when outputting DWARF 2 debug information at the normal level, as long as there is assembler support, <samp class="option">-fvar-tracking-assignments</samp> is enabled and <samp class="option">-gstrict-dwarf</samp> is not. When assembler support is not available, this may still be enabled, but it will force GCC to output internal line number tables, and if <samp class="option">-ginternal-reset-location-views</samp> is not enabled, that will most certainly lead to silently mismatching location views. </p> <p>There is a proposed representation for view numbers that is not backward compatible with the location list format introduced in DWARF 5, that can be enabled with <samp class="option">-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</samp>. This option may be removed in the future, is only provided as a reference implementation of the proposed representation. Debug information consumers are not expected to support this extended format, and they would be rendered unable to decode location lists using it. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-ginternal-reset-location-views</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-gno-internal-reset-location-views</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Attempt to determine location views that can be omitted from location view lists. This requires the compiler to have very accurate insn length estimates, which isn’t always the case, and it may cause incorrect view lists to be generated silently when using an assembler that does not support location view lists. The GNU assembler will flag any such error as a <code class="code">view number mismatch</code>. This is only enabled on ports that define a reliable estimation function. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-ginline-points</code></span>
</dt> <dt><code class="code">-gno-inline-points</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Generate extended debug information for inlined functions. Location view tracking markers are inserted at inlined entry points, so that address and view numbers can be computed and output in debug information. This can be enabled independently of location views, in which case the view numbers won’t be output, but it can only be enabled along with statement frontiers, and it is only enabled by default if location views are enabled. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-gz<span class="r">[</span>=<var class="var">type</var><span class="r">]</span></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Produce compressed debug sections in DWARF format, if that is supported. If <var class="var">type</var> is not given, the default type depends on the capabilities of the assembler and linker used. <var class="var">type</var> may be one of ‘<samp class="samp">none</samp>’ (don’t compress debug sections), or ‘<samp class="samp">zlib</samp>’ (use zlib compression in ELF gABI format). If the linker doesn’t support writing compressed debug sections, the option is rejected. Otherwise, if the assembler does not support them, <samp class="option">-gz</samp> is silently ignored when producing object files. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the base name of the compilation source file matches the base name of file in which the struct is defined. </p> <p>This option substantially reduces the size of debugging information, but at significant potential loss in type information to the debugger. See <samp class="option">-femit-struct-debug-reduced</samp> for a less aggressive option. See <samp class="option">-femit-struct-debug-detailed</samp> for more detailed control. </p> <p>This option works only with DWARF debug output. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-femit-struct-debug-reduced</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the base name of the compilation source file matches the base name of file in which the type is defined, unless the struct is a template or defined in a system header. </p> <p>This option significantly reduces the size of debugging information, with some potential loss in type information to the debugger. See <samp class="option">-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</samp> for a more aggressive option. See <samp class="option">-femit-struct-debug-detailed</samp> for more detailed control. </p> <p>This option works only with DWARF debug output. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-femit-struct-debug-detailed<span class="r">[</span>=<var class="var">spec-list</var><span class="r">]</span></code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Specify the struct-like types for which the compiler generates debug information. The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information between different object files within the same program. </p> <p>This option is a detailed version of <samp class="option">-femit-struct-debug-reduced</samp> and <samp class="option">-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</samp>, which serves for most needs. </p> <p>A specification has the syntax [‘<samp class="samp">dir:</samp>’|‘<samp class="samp">ind:</samp>’][‘<samp class="samp">ord:</samp>’|‘<samp class="samp">gen:</samp>’](‘<samp class="samp">any</samp>’|‘<samp class="samp">sys</samp>’|‘<samp class="samp">base</samp>’|‘<samp class="samp">none</samp>’) </p> <p>The optional first word limits the specification to structs that are used directly (‘<samp class="samp">dir:</samp>’) or used indirectly (‘<samp class="samp">ind:</samp>’). A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member. Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs. That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect. An example is ‘<samp class="samp">struct one direct; struct two * indirect;</samp>’. </p> <p>The optional second word limits the specification to ordinary structs (‘<samp class="samp">ord:</samp>’) or generic structs (‘<samp class="samp">gen:</samp>’). Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain. For C++, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes, or non-template classes within the above. Other programming languages have generics, but <samp class="option">-femit-struct-debug-detailed</samp> does not yet implement them. </p> <p>The third word specifies the source files for those structs for which the compiler should emit debug information. The values ‘<samp class="samp">none</samp>’ and ‘<samp class="samp">any</samp>’ have the normal meaning. The value ‘<samp class="samp">base</samp>’ means that the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears must match the base of the name of the main compilation file. In practice, this means that when compiling <samp class="file">foo.c</samp>, debug information is generated for types declared in that file and <samp class="file">foo.h</samp>, but not other header files. The value ‘<samp class="samp">sys</samp>’ means those types satisfying ‘<samp class="samp">base</samp>’ or declared in system or compiler headers. </p> <p>You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application. </p> <p>The default is <samp class="option">-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all</samp>. </p> <p>This option works only with DWARF debug output. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</code></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Emit DWARF unwind info as compiler generated <code class="code">.eh_frame</code> section instead of using GAS <code class="code">.cfi_*</code> directives. </p> </dd> <dt>
 <span><code class="code">-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types</code></span>
</dt> <dd><p>Normally, when producing DWARF output, GCC avoids producing debug symbol output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled. Sometimes it is useful to have GCC emit debugging information for all types declared in a compilation unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used in that compilation unit, for example if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is not actually used in your program (but is declared). More often, however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space. </p></dd> </dl> </div><div class="_attribution">
