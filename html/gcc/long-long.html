<h1 class="section" id="Double_002dWord-Integers">6.10 Double-Word Integers</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Long-Long">         <p>ISO C99 and ISO C++11 support data types for integers that are at least 64 bits wide, and as an extension GCC supports them in C90 and C++98 modes. Simply write <code class="code">long long int</code> for a signed integer, or <code class="code">unsigned long long int</code> for an unsigned integer. To make an integer constant of type <code class="code">long long int</code>, add the suffix ‘<samp class="samp">LL</samp>’ to the integer. To make an integer constant of type <code class="code">unsigned long
long int</code>, add the suffix ‘<samp class="samp">ULL</samp>’ to the integer. </p> <p>You can use these types in arithmetic like any other integer types. Addition, subtraction, and bitwise boolean operations on these types are open-coded on all types of machines. Multiplication is open-coded if the machine supports a fullword-to-doubleword widening multiply instruction. Division and shifts are open-coded only on machines that provide special support. The operations that are not open-coded use special library routines that come with GCC. </p> <p>There may be pitfalls when you use <code class="code">long long</code> types for function arguments without function prototypes. If a function expects type <code class="code">int</code> for its argument, and you pass a value of type <code class="code">long long int</code>, confusion results because the caller and the subroutine disagree about the number of bytes for the argument. Likewise, if the function expects <code class="code">long long int</code> and you pass <code class="code">int</code>. The best way to avoid such problems is to use prototypes. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
