<h1 class="section" id="Brief-Description-of-gcov-Data-Files">10.4 Brief Description of gcov Data Files</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Gcov-Data-Files">    <p><code class="command">gcov</code> uses two files for profiling. The names of these files are derived from the original <em class="emph">object</em> file by substituting the file suffix with either <samp class="file">.gcno</samp>, or <samp class="file">.gcda</samp>. The files contain coverage and profile data stored in a platform-independent format. The <samp class="file">.gcno</samp> files are placed in the same directory as the object file. By default, the <samp class="file">.gcda</samp> files are also stored in the same directory as the object file, but the GCC <samp class="option">-fprofile-dir</samp> option may be used to store the <samp class="file">.gcda</samp> files in a separate directory. </p> <p>The <samp class="file">.gcno</samp> notes file is generated when the source file is compiled with the GCC <samp class="option">-ftest-coverage</samp> option. It contains information to reconstruct the basic block graphs and assign source line numbers to blocks. </p> <p>The <samp class="file">.gcda</samp> count data file is generated when a program containing object files built with the GCC <samp class="option">-fprofile-arcs</samp> option is executed. A separate <samp class="file">.gcda</samp> file is created for each object file compiled with this option. It contains arc transition counts, value profile counts, and some summary information. </p> <p>It is not recommended to access the coverage files directly. Consumers should use the intermediate format that is provided by <code class="command">gcov</code> tool via <samp class="option">--json-format</samp> option. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
