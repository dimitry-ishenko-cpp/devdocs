The following lists all such areas, along with the section numbers from the ISO/IEC 14882:1998 and ISO/IEC 14882:2003 standards. Some areas are only implementation-defined in one version of the standard. </p> <p>Some choices depend on the externally determined ABI for the platform (including standard character encodings) which GCC follows; these are listed as “determined by ABI” below. See <a class="xref" href="compatibility.html">Binary Compatibility</a>, and <a class="uref" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">https://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</a>. Some choices are documented in the preprocessor manual. See <a data-manual="cpp" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Implementation-defined-behavior.html#Implementation-defined-behavior">Implementation-defined behavior</a> in The C Preprocessor. Some choices are documented in the corresponding document for the C language. See <a class="xref" href="c-implementation.html">C Implementation-Defined Behavior</a>. Some choices are made by the library and operating system (or other environment when compiling for a freestanding environment); refer to their documentation for details. </p> <ul class="mini-toc"> <li><a href="conditionally-supported-behavior.html" accesskey="1">Conditionally-Supported Behavior</a></li> <li><a href="exception-handling.html" accesskey="2">Exception Handling</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
