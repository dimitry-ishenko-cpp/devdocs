The two interfaces come in a low level interface, consisting of built-in functions specific to PowerPC and a higher level interface consisting of inline functions that are common between PowerPC and S/390. </p> <ul class="mini-toc"> <li><a href="#PowerPC-HTM-Low-Level-Built_002din-Functions" accesskey="1">PowerPC HTM Low Level Built-in Functions</a></li> <li><a href="#PowerPC-HTM-High-Level-Inline-Functions" accesskey="2">PowerPC HTM High Level Inline Functions</a></li> </ul> <div class="subsubsection-level-extent" id="PowerPC-HTM-Low-Level-Built_002din-Functions"> <h1 class="subsubsection"><span>6.62.27.1 PowerPC HTM Low Level Built-in Functions</span></h1> <p>The following low level built-in functions are available with <samp class="option">-mhtm</samp> or <samp class="option">-mcpu=CPU</samp> where CPU is ‘power8’ or later. They all generate the machine instruction that is part of the name. </p> <p>The HTM builtins (with the exception of <code class="code">__builtin_tbegin</code>) return the full 4-bit condition register value set by their associated hardware instruction. The header file <code class="code">htmintrin.h</code> defines some macros that can be used to decipher the return value. The <code class="code">__builtin_tbegin</code> builtin returns a simple <code class="code">true</code> or <code class="code">false</code> value depending on whether a transaction was successfully started or not. The arguments of the builtins match exactly the type and order of the associated hardware instruction’s operands, except for the <code class="code">__builtin_tcheck</code> builtin, which does not take any input arguments. Refer to the ISA manual for a description of each instruction’s operands. </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">unsigned int __builtin_tbegin (unsigned int);

</div> <p>In addition to the above HTM built-ins, we have added built-ins for some common extended mnemonics of the HTM instructions: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">unsigned int __builtin_tendall (void);
unsigned int __builtin_tresume (void);
unsigned int __builtin_tsuspend (void);</pre>
</div> <p>Note that the semantics of the above HTM builtins are required to mimic the locking semantics used for critical sections. Builtins that are used to create a new transaction or restart a suspended transaction must have lock acquisition like semantics while those builtins that end or suspend a transaction must have lock release like semantics. Specifically, this must mimic lock semantics as specified by C++11, for example: Lock acquisition is as-if an execution of __atomic_exchange_n(&amp;globallock,1,__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE) that returns 0, and lock release is as-if an execution of __atomic_store(&amp;globallock,0,__ATOMIC_RELEASE), with globallock being an implicit implementation-defined lock used for all transactions. The HTM instructions associated with with the builtins inherently provide the correct acquisition and release hardware barriers required. However, the compiler must also be prohibited from moving loads and stores across the builtins in a way that would violate their semantics. This has been accomplished by adding memory barriers to the associated HTM instructions (which is a conservative approach to provide acquire and release semantics). Earlier versions of the compiler did not treat the HTM instructions as memory barriers. A <code class="code">__TM_FENCE__</code> macro has been added, which can be used to determine whether the current compiler treats HTM instructions as memory barriers or not. This allows the user to explicitly add memory barriers to their code when using an older version of the compiler. </p> <p>The following set of built-in functions are available to gain access to the HTM specific special purpose registers. </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">unsigned long __builtin_get_texasr (void);
