<h1 class="section" id="Integers">4.5 Integers</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Integers-implementation">    <ul class="itemize mark-bullet"> <li>Any extended integer types that exist in the implementation (C99 and C11 6.2.5). <p>GCC does not support any extended integer types. </p> </li>
<li>Whether signed integer types are represented using sign and magnitude, two’s complement, or one’s complement, and whether the extraordinary value is a trap representation or an ordinary value (C99 and C11 6.2.6.2). <p>GCC supports only two’s complement integer types, and all bit patterns are ordinary values. </p> </li>
<li>The rank of any extended integer type relative to another extended integer type with the same precision (C99 and C11 6.3.1.1). <p>GCC does not support any extended integer types. </p> </li>
<li>The result of, or the signal raised by, converting an integer to a signed integer type when the value cannot be represented in an object of that type (C90 6.2.1.2, C99 and C11 6.3.1.3). <p>For conversion to a type of width <em class="math">N</em>, the value is reduced modulo <em class="math">2^N</em> to be within range of the type; no signal is raised. </p> </li>
<li>The results of some bitwise operations on signed integers (C90 6.3, C99 and C11 6.5). <p>Bitwise operators act on the representation of the value including both the sign and value bits, where the sign bit is considered immediately above the highest-value value bit. Signed ‘<samp class="samp">&gt;&gt;</samp>’ acts on negative numbers by sign extension. </p> <p>As an extension to the C language, GCC does not use the latitude given in C99 and C11 only to treat certain aspects of signed ‘<samp class="samp">&lt;&lt;</samp>’ as undefined. However, <samp class="option">-fsanitize=shift</samp> (and <samp class="option">-fsanitize=undefined</samp>) will diagnose such cases. They are also diagnosed where constant expressions are required. </p> </li>
<li>The sign of the remainder on integer division (C90 6.3.5). <p>GCC always follows the C99 and C11 requirement that the result of division is truncated towards zero. </p> </li>
