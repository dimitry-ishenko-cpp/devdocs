GCC’s implementation allows whitespace in the form of spaces, horizontal and vertical tabs, and form feeds between the backslash and the subsequent newline. The preprocessor issues a warning, but treats it as a valid escaped newline and combines the two lines to form a single logical line. This works within comments and tokens, as well as between tokens. Comments are <em class="emph">not</em> treated as whitespace for the purposes of this relaxation, since they have not yet been replaced with spaces. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
