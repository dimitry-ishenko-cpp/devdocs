<h1 class="section" id="Compiling-C_002b_002b-Programs">3.3 Compiling C++ Programs</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Invoking-G_002b_002b">      <p>C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes ‘<samp class="samp">.C</samp>’, ‘<samp class="samp">.cc</samp>’, ‘<samp class="samp">.cpp</samp>’, ‘<samp class="samp">.CPP</samp>’, ‘<samp class="samp">.c++</samp>’, ‘<samp class="samp">.cp</samp>’, or ‘<samp class="samp">.cxx</samp>’; C++ header files often use ‘<samp class="samp">.hh</samp>’, ‘<samp class="samp">.hpp</samp>’, ‘<samp class="samp">.H</samp>’, or (for shared template code) ‘<samp class="samp">.tcc</samp>’; and preprocessed C++ files use the suffix ‘<samp class="samp">.ii</samp>’. GCC recognizes files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually with the name <code class="command">gcc</code>). </p>   <p>However, the use of <code class="command">gcc</code> does not add the C++ library. <code class="command">g++</code> is a program that calls GCC and automatically specifies linking against the C++ library. It treats ‘<samp class="samp">.c</samp>’, ‘<samp class="samp">.h</samp>’ and ‘<samp class="samp">.i</samp>’ files as C++ source files instead of C source files unless <samp class="option">-x</samp> is used. This program is also useful when precompiling a C header file with a ‘<samp class="samp">.h</samp>’ extension for use in C++ compilations. On many systems, <code class="command">g++</code> is also installed with the name <code class="command">c++</code>. </p>  <p>When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs. See <a class="xref" href="c-dialect-options.html">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>, for explanations of options for languages related to C. See <a class="xref" href="c_002b_002b-dialect-options.html">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</a>, for explanations of options that are meaningful only for C++ programs. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
