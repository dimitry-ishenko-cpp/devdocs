For example, one purpose of instrumentation is collect profiling statistics for use in finding program hot spots, code coverage analysis, or profile-guided optimizations. Another class of program instrumentation is adding run-time checking to detect programming errors like invalid pointer dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as well as deliberately hostile attacks such as stack smashing or C++ vtable hijacking. There is also a general hook which can be used to implement other forms of tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or program analysis purposes. </p> <dl class="table"> <dt>

<p>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis program <code class="command">prof</code> (for <samp class="option">-p</samp>) or <code class="command">gprof</code> (for <samp class="option">-pg</samp>). You must use this option when compiling the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when linking. </p> <p>You can use the function attribute <code class="code">no_instrument_function</code> to suppress profiling of individual functions when compiling with these options. See <a class="xref" href="common-function-attributes.html">Common Function Attributes</a>. </p> </dd> <dt>

</dt> <dd>
<p>Add code so that program flow <em class="dfn">arcs</em> are instrumented. During execution the program records how many times each branch and call is executed and how many times it is taken or returns. On targets that support constructors with priority support, profiling properly handles constructors, destructors and C++ constructors (and destructors) of classes which are used as a type of a global variable. </p> <p>When the compiled program exits it saves this data to a file called <samp class="file"><var class="var">auxname</var>.gcda</samp> for each source file. The data may be used for profile-directed optimizations (<samp class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</samp>), or for test coverage analysis (<samp class="option">-ftest-coverage</samp>). Each object file’s <var class="var">auxname</var> is generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is the basename of the source file. In both cases any suffix is removed (e.g. <samp class="file">foo.gcda</samp> for input file <samp class="file">dir/foo.c</samp>, or <samp class="file">dir/foo.gcda</samp> for output file specified as <samp class="option">-o dir/foo.o</samp>). </p> <p>Note that if a command line directly links source files, the corresponding <var class="var">.gcda</var> files will be prefixed with the unsuffixed name of the output file. E.g. <code class="code">gcc a.c b.c -o binary</code> would generate <samp class="file">binary-a.gcda</samp> and <samp class="file">binary-b.gcda</samp> files. </p> <p>See <a class="xref" href="cross-profiling.html">Data File Relocation to Support Cross-Profiling</a>. </p> </dd> <dt>

The option is a synonym for <samp class="option">-fprofile-arcs</samp> <samp class="option">-ftest-coverage</samp> (when compiling) and <samp class="option">-lgcov</samp> (when linking). See the documentation for those options for more details. </p> <ul class="itemize mark-bullet"> <li>Compile the source files with <samp class="option">-fprofile-arcs</samp> plus optimization and code generation options. For test coverage analysis, use the additional <samp class="option">-ftest-coverage</samp> option. You do not need to profile every source file in a program. </li>
<li>Compile the source files additionally with <samp class="option">-fprofile-abs-path</samp> to create absolute path names in the <samp class="file">.gcno</samp> files. This allows <code class="command">gcov</code> to find the correct sources in projects where compilations occur with different working directories. </li>
<li>Link your object files with <samp class="option">-lgcov</samp> or <samp class="option">-fprofile-arcs</samp> (the latter implies the former). </li>
<li>Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile information. This may be repeated any number of times. You can run concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated. Unless a strict ISO C dialect option is in effect, <code class="code">fork</code> calls are detected and correctly handled without double counting. <p>Moreover, an object file can be recompiled multiple times and the corresponding <samp class="file">.gcda</samp> file merges as long as the source file and the compiler options are unchanged. </p> </li>
<li>For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with the same optimization and code generation options plus <samp class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</samp> (see <a class="pxref" href="optimize-options.html">Options that Control Optimization</a>). </li>
<li>For test coverage analysis, use <code class="command">gcov</code> to produce human readable information from the <samp class="file">.gcno</samp> and <samp class="file">.gcda</samp> files. Refer to the <code class="command">gcov</code> documentation for further information. </li>
</ul> <p>With <samp class="option">-fprofile-arcs</samp>, for each function of your program GCC creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph. Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are executed. When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic block must be created to hold the instrumentation code. </p> </dd> <dt>

Both absolute and relative paths can be used. By default, GCC uses the current directory as <var class="var">path</var>, thus the profile data file appears in the same directory as the object file. In order to prevent the file name clashing, if the object file name is not an absolute path, we mangle the absolute path of the <samp class="file"><var class="var">sourcename</var>.gcda</samp> file and use it as the file name of a <samp class="file">.gcda</samp> file.

If compiling all code, including library code, with <samp class="option">-fsplit-stack</samp> is not an option, then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled without <samp class="option">-fsplit-stack</samp> always has a large stack. Support for this is implemented in the gold linker in GNU binutils release 2.21 and later. </p> </dd> <dt>

<p>This option is only available when compiling C++ code. It turns on (or off, if using <samp class="option">-fvtable-verify=none</samp>) the security feature that verifies at run time, for every virtual call, that the vtable pointer through which the call is made is valid for the type of the object, and has not been corrupted or overwritten. If an invalid vtable pointer is detected at run time, an error is reported and execution of the program is immediately halted. </p> <p>This option causes run-time data structures to be built at program startup, which are used for verifying the vtable pointers. The options ‘<samp class="samp">std</samp>’ and ‘<samp class="samp">preinit</samp>’ control the timing of when these data structures are built. In both cases the data structures are built before execution reaches <code class="code">main</code>. Using <samp class="option">-fvtable-verify=std</samp> causes the data structures to be built after shared libraries have been loaded and initialized. <samp class="option">-fvtable-verify=preinit</samp> causes them to be built before shared libraries have been loaded and initialized. </p> <p>If this option appears multiple times in the command line with different values specified, ‘<samp class="samp">none</samp>’ takes highest priority over both ‘<samp class="samp">std</samp>’ and ‘<samp class="samp">preinit</samp>’; ‘<samp class="samp">preinit</samp>’ takes priority over ‘<samp class="samp">std</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt>

<p>When used in conjunction with <samp class="option">-fvtable-verify=std</samp> or <samp class="option">-fvtable-verify=preinit</samp>, causes debug versions of the runtime functions for the vtable verification feature to be called. This flag also causes the compiler to log information about which vtable pointers it finds for each class.

<p>This is a debugging flag. When used in conjunction with <samp class="option">-fvtable-verify=std</samp> or <samp class="option">-fvtable-verify=preinit</samp>, this causes the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual calls it encounters and the number of verifications it inserts. It also counts the number of calls to certain run-time library functions that it inserts and logs this information for each compilation unit. The compiler writes this information to a file named <samp class="file">vtv_count_data.log</samp> in the directory named by the environment variable <code class="env">VTV_LOGS_DIR</code> if that is defined or the current working directory otherwise. It also counts the size of the vtable pointer sets for each class, and writes this information to <samp class="file">vtv_class_set_sizes.log</samp> in the same directory. </p> <p>Note: This feature <em class="emph">appends</em> data to the log files.

<p>Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions. Just after function entry and just before function exit, the following profiling functions are called with the address of the current function and its call site. (On some platforms, <code class="code">__builtin_return_address</code> does not work beyond the current function, so the call site information may not be available to the profiling functions otherwise.) </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                               void *call_site);
void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                               void *call_site);</pre>
</div> <p>The first argument is the address of the start of the current function, which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table. </p> <p>This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other functions. The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the inline function is entered and exited. This means that addressable versions of such functions must be available. If all your uses of a function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of code size. If you use <code class="code">extern inline</code> in your C code, an addressable version of such functions must be provided. (This is normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without providing static copies.) </p> <p>A function may be given the attribute <code class="code">no_instrument_function</code>, in which case this instrumentation is not done. This can be used, for example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling routines generate output or allocate memory).

<p>This is similar to <samp class="option">-finstrument-functions</samp>, but the profiling functions are called only once per instrumented function, i.e. the first profiling function is called after the first entry into the instrumented function and the second profiling function is called before the exit corresponding to this first entry. </p> <p>The definition of <code class="code">once</code> for the purpose of this option is a little vague because the implementation is not protected against data races. As a result, the implementation only guarantees that the profiling functions are called at <em class="emph">least</em> once per process and at <em class="emph">most</em> once per thread, but the calls are always paired, that is to say, if a thread calls the first function, then it will call the second function, unless it never reaches the exit of the instrumented function. </p> </dd> <dt>

If the file that contains a function definition matches with one of <var class="var">file</var>, then that function is not instrumented. The match is done on substrings: if the <var class="var">file</var> parameter is a substring of the file name, it is considered to be a match. </p> <p>For example: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys</pre>

</dt> <dd> <p>This is similar to <samp class="option">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</samp>, but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from instrumentation. The function name to be matched is its user-visible name, such as <code class="code">vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)</code>, not the internal mangled name (e.g., <code class="code">_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE</code>). The match is done on substrings: if the <var class="var">sym</var> parameter is a substring of the function name, it is considered to be a match.

<p>Generate <var class="var">N</var> NOPs right at the beginning of each function, with the function entry point before the <var class="var">M</var>th NOP. If <var class="var">M</var> is omitted, it defaults to <code class="code">0</code> so the function entry points to the address just at the first NOP. The NOP instructions reserve extra space which can be used to patch in any desired instrumentation at run time, provided that the code segment is writable. The amount of space is controllable indirectly via the number of NOPs; the NOP instruction used corresponds to the instruction emitted by the internal GCC back-end interface <code class="code">gen_nop</code>. This behavior is target-specific and may also depend on the architecture variant and/or other compilation options. </p> <p>For run-time identification, the starting addresses of these areas, which correspond to their respective function entries minus <var class="var">M</var>, are additionally collected in the <code class="code">__patchable_function_entries</code> section of the resulting binary. </p> <p>Note that the value of <code class="code">__attribute__ ((patchable_function_entry
(N,M)))</code> takes precedence over command-line option <samp class="option">-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</samp>. This can be used to increase the area size or to remove it completely on a single function. If <code class="code">N=0</code>, no pad location is recorded. </p> <p>The NOP instructions are inserted at—and maybe before, depending on <var class="var">M</var>—the function entry address, even before the prologue. On PowerPC with the ELFv2 ABI, for a function with dual entry points, the local entry point is this function entry address. </p> <p>The maximum value of <var class="var">N</var> and <var class="var">M</var> is 65535. On PowerPC with the ELFv2 ABI, for a function with dual entry points, the supported values for <var class="var">M</var> are 0, 2, 6 and 14. </p>
