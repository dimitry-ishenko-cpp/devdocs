Value ‘<samp class="samp">0</samp>’ of <var class="var">level</var> de-activates this option. Value ‘<samp class="samp">1</samp>’ tracks tokens locations in a degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a function-like macro have the same location. Value ‘<samp class="samp">2</samp>’ tracks tokens locations completely.

Other <var class="var">letters</var> are interpreted by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and so are silently ignored. If you specify <var class="var">letters</var> whose behavior conflicts, the result is undefined.

<p>Instead of the normal output, generate a list of ‘<samp class="samp">#define</samp>’ directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros. This gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor. Assuming you have no file <samp class="file">foo.h</samp>, the command </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h</pre>
</div> <p>shows all the predefined macros. </p> <p>If you use <samp class="option">-dM</samp> without the <samp class="option">-E</samp> option, <samp class="option">-dM</samp> is interpreted as a synonym for <samp class="option">-fdump-rtl-mach</samp>. See <a data-manual="gcc" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Developer-Options.html#Developer-Options">(gcc)Developer Options</a>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-dD</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-dD"> ¶</a></span>

<p>Like <samp class="option">-dM</samp> except in two respects: it does <em class="emph">not</em> include the predefined macros, and it outputs <em class="emph">both</em> the ‘<samp class="samp">#define</samp>’ directives and the result of preprocessing. Both kinds of output go to the standard output file. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-dN</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-dN"> ¶</a></span>

<p>Like <samp class="option">-dD</samp>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-dI</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-dI"> ¶</a></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Output ‘<samp class="samp">#include</samp>’ directives in addition to the result of preprocessing. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-dU</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-dU"> ¶</a></span>
</dt> <dd><p>Like <samp class="option">-dD</samp> except that only macros that are expanded, or whose definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and ‘<samp class="samp">#undef</samp>’ directives are also output for macros tested but undefined at the time. </p></dd> </dl> </dd> <dt>

</dt> <dd>
<p>This option is only useful for debugging GCC. When used from CPP or with <samp class="option">-E</samp>, it dumps debugging information about location maps. Every token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map its location belongs to. </p> <p>When used from GCC without <samp class="option">-E</samp>, this option has no effect. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-Wp,<var class="var">option</var></code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-Wp"> ¶</a></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>You can use <samp class="option">-Wp,<var class="var">option</var></samp> to bypass the compiler driver and pass <var class="var">option</var> directly through to the preprocessor. If <var class="var">option</var> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas. However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and <samp class="option">-Wp</samp> forcibly bypasses this phase. The preprocessor’s direct interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible you should avoid using <samp class="option">-Wp</samp> and let the driver handle the options instead. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-Xpreprocessor <var class="var">option</var></code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-Xpreprocessor"> ¶</a></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Pass <var class="var">option</var> as an option to the preprocessor. You can use this to supply system-specific preprocessor options that GCC does not recognize. </p> <p>If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use <samp class="option">-Xpreprocessor</samp> twice, once for the option and once for the argument. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-no-integrated-cpp</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-no-integrated-cpp"> ¶</a></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation. By default, GCC performs preprocessing as an integrated part of input tokenization and parsing. If this option is provided, the appropriate language front end (<code class="command">cc1</code>, <code class="command">cc1plus</code>, or <code class="command">cc1obj</code> for C, C++, and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice, once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation of the preprocessed input. This option may be useful in conjunction with the <samp class="option">-B</samp> or <samp class="option">-wrapper</samp> options to specify an alternate preprocessor or perform additional processing of the program source between normal preprocessing and compilation. </p> </dd> <dt>
<span><code class="code">-flarge-source-files</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-flarge-source-files"> ¶</a></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Adjust GCC to expect large source files, at the expense of slower compilation and higher memory usage. </p> <p>Specifically, GCC normally tracks both column numbers and line numbers within source files and it normally prints both of these numbers in diagnostics. However, once it has processed a certain number of source lines, it stops tracking column numbers and only tracks line numbers. This means that diagnostics for later lines do not include column numbers. It also means that options like <samp class="option">-Wmisleading-indentation</samp> cease to work at that point, although the compiler prints a note if this happens. Passing <samp class="option">-flarge-source-files</samp> significantly increases the number of source lines that GCC can process before it stops tracking columns. </p> </dd> </dl> </div>  <div class="nav-panel"> <p> Next: <a href="assembler-options.html">Passing Options to the Assembler</a>, Previous: <a href="instrumentation-options.html">Program Instrumentation Options</a>, Up: <a href="invoking-gcc.html">GCC Command Options</a> [<a href="index.html#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="indices.html" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
