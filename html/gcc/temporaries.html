<h1 class="subsection" id="Temporaries-May-Vanish-Before-You-Expect">14.7.3 Temporaries May Vanish Before You Expect</h1> <div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Temporaries">      <p>It is dangerous to use pointers or references to <em class="emph">portions</em> of a temporary object. The compiler may very well delete the object before you expect it to, leaving a pointer to garbage. The most common place where this problem crops up is in classes like string classes, especially ones that define a conversion function to type <code class="code">char *</code> or <code class="code">const char *</code>—which is one reason why the standard <code class="code">string</code> class requires you to call the <code class="code">c_str</code> member function. However, any class that returns a pointer to some internal structure is potentially subject to this problem. </p> <p>For example, a program may use a function <code class="code">strfunc</code> that returns <code class="code">string</code> objects, and another function <code class="code">charfunc</code> that operates on pointers to <code class="code">char</code>: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">string strfunc ();
void charfunc (const char *);

void
f ()
{
  const char *p = strfunc().c_str();
  …
  charfunc (p);
  …
  charfunc (p);
}</pre>
</div> <p>In this situation, it may seem reasonable to save a pointer to the C string returned by the <code class="code">c_str</code> member function and use that rather than call <code class="code">c_str</code> repeatedly. However, the temporary string created by the call to <code class="code">strfunc</code> is destroyed after <code class="code">p</code> is initialized, at which point <code class="code">p</code> is left pointing to freed memory. </p> <p>Code like this may run successfully under some other compilers, particularly obsolete cfront-based compilers that delete temporaries along with normal local variables. However, the GNU C++ behavior is standard-conforming, so if your program depends on late destruction of temporaries it is not portable. </p> <p>The safe way to write such code is to give the temporary a name, which forces it to remain until the end of the scope of the name. For example: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">const string&amp; tmp = strfunc ();
charfunc (tmp.c_str ());</pre>
