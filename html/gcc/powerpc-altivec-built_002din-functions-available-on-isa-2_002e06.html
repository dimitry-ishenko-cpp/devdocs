These are normally enabled by adding <samp class="option">-mvsx</samp> to the command line. </p> <p>When <samp class="option">-mvsx</samp> is used, the following additional vector types are implemented. </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">vector unsigned __int128
