See <a class="xref" href="standards.html">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of what this means. Beyond the library facilities required of such an implementation, the rest of the C library is supplied by the vendor of the operating system. If that C library doesn’t conform to the C standards, then your programs might get warnings (especially when using <samp class="option">-Wall</samp>) that you don’t expect. </p> <p>For example, the <code class="code">sprintf</code> function on SunOS 4.1.3 returns <code class="code">char *</code> while the C standard says that <code class="code">sprintf</code> returns an <code class="code">int</code>. The <code class="code">fixincludes</code> program could make the prototype for this function match the Standard, but that would be wrong, since the function will still return <code class="code">char *</code>. </p> <p>If you need a Standard compliant library, then you need to find one, as GCC does not provide one. The GNU C library (called <code class="code">glibc</code>) provides ISO C, POSIX, BSD, SystemV and X/Open compatibility for GNU/Linux and HURD-based GNU systems; no recent version of it supports other systems, though some very old versions did. Version 2.2 of the GNU C library includes nearly complete C99 support. You could also ask your operating system vendor if newer libraries are available. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
