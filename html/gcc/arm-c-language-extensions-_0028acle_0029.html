<h1 class="subsection" id="ARM-C-Language-Extensions-_0028ACLE_0029-1">6.62.7 ARM C Language Extensions (ACLE)</h1> <div class="subsection-level-extent" id="ARM-C-Language-Extensions-_0028ACLE_0029">    <p>GCC implements extensions for C as described in the ARM C Language Extensions (ACLE) specification, which can be found at <a class="uref" href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0053/latest/">https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0053/latest/</a>. </p> <p>As a part of ACLE, GCC implements extensions for Advanced SIMD as described in the ARM C Language Extensions Specification. The complete list of Advanced SIMD intrinsics can be found at <a class="uref" href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0073/latest/">https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0073/latest/</a>. The built-in intrinsics for the Advanced SIMD extension are available when NEON is enabled. </p> <p>Currently, ARM and AArch64 back ends do not support ACLE 2.0 fully. Both back ends support CRC32 intrinsics and the ARM back end supports the Coprocessor intrinsics, all from <samp class="file">arm_acle.h</samp>. The ARM back end’s 16-bit floating-point Advanced SIMD intrinsics currently comply to ACLE v1.1. AArch64’s back end does not have support for 16-bit floating point Advanced SIMD intrinsics yet. </p> <p>See <a class="ref" href="arm-options.html">ARM Options</a> and <a class="ref" href="aarch64-options.html">AArch64 Options</a> for more information on the availability of extensions. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
