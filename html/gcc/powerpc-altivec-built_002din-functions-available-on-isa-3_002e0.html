</div> <p>The <code class="code">scalar_extract_exp</code> with a 64-bit source argument function requires an environment supporting ISA 3.0 or later. The <code class="code">scalar_extract_exp</code> with a 128-bit source argument and <code class="code">scalar_extract_sig</code> functions require a 64-bit environment supporting ISA 3.0 or later. The <code class="code">scalar_extract_exp</code> and <code class="code">scalar_extract_sig</code> built-in functions return the significand and the biased exponent value respectively of their <code class="code">source</code> arguments. When supplied with a 64-bit <code class="code">source</code> argument, the result returned by <code class="code">scalar_extract_sig</code> has the <code class="code">0x0010000000000000</code> bit set if the functionâ€™s <code class="code">source</code> argument is in normalized form. Otherwise, this bit is set to 0. When supplied with a 128-bit <code class="code">source</code> argument, the <code class="code">0x00010000000000000000000000000000</code> bit of the result is treated similarly. Note that the sign of the significand is not represented in the result returned from the <code class="code">scalar_extract_sig</code> function. Use the <code class="code">scalar_test_neg</code> function to test the sign of its <code class="code">double</code> argument. </p> <p>The <code class="code">scalar_insert_exp</code> functions require a 64-bit environment supporting ISA 3.0 or later. When supplied with a 64-bit first argument, the <code class="code">scalar_insert_exp</code> built-in function returns a double-precision floating point value that is constructed by assembling the values of its <code class="code">significand</code> and <code class="code">exponent</code> arguments. The sign of the result is copied from the most significant bit of the <code class="code">significand</code> argument. The significand and exponent components of the result are composed of the least significant 11 bits of the <code class="code">exponent</code> argument and the least significant 52 bits of the <code class="code">significand</code> argument respectively. </p> <p>When supplied with a 128-bit first argument, the <code class="code">scalar_insert_exp</code> built-in function returns a quad-precision IEEE floating point value if the two arguments were scalar. If the two arguments are vectors, the return value is a vector IEEE floating point value. The sign bit of the result is copied from the most significant bit of the <code class="code">significand</code> argument. The significand and exponent components of the result are composed of the least significant 15 bits of the <code class="code">exponent</code> argument (element 0 on big-endian and element 1 on little-endian) and the least significant 112 bits of the <code class="code">significand</code> argument respectively. Note, the <code class="code">significand</code> is the scalar argument or in the case of vector arguments, <code class="code">significand</code> is element 0 for big-endian and element 1 for little-endian. </p> <p>The <code class="code">scalar_extract_exp_to_vec</code>, and <code class="code">scalar_extract_sig_to_vec</code> are similar to <code class="code">scalar_extract_exp</code>, <code class="code">scalar_extract_sig</code> except they return a vector result of type unsigned long long and unsigned __int128 respectively. </p> <p>The <code class="code">scalar_cmp_exp_gt</code>, <code class="code">scalar_cmp_exp_lt</code>, <code class="code">scalar_cmp_exp_eq</code>, and <code class="code">scalar_cmp_exp_unordered</code> built-in functions return a non-zero value if <code class="code">arg1</code> is greater than, less than, equal to, or not comparable to <code class="code">arg2</code> respectively. The arguments are not comparable if one or the other equals NaN (not a number). </p> <p>The <code class="code">scalar_test_data_class</code> built-in function returns 1 if any of the condition tests enabled by the value of the <code class="code">condition</code> variable are true, and 0 otherwise. The <code class="code">condition</code> argument must be a compile-time constant integer with value not exceeding 127. The <code class="code">condition</code> argument is encoded as a bitmask with each bit enabling the testing of a different condition, as characterized by the following: </p>

</div> <p>The <code class="code">vec_all_nez</code>, <code class="code">vec_any_eqz</code>, and <code class="code">vec_cmpnez</code> perform pairwise comparisons between the elements at the same positions within their two vector arguments. The <code class="code">vec_all_nez</code> function returns a non-zero value if and only if all pairwise comparisons are not equal and no element of either vector argument contains a zero. The <code class="code">vec_any_eqz</code> function returns a non-zero value if and only if at least one pairwise comparison is equal or if at least one element of either vector argument contains a zero. The <code class="code">vec_cmpnez</code> function returns a vector of the same type as its two arguments, within which each element consists of all ones to denote that either the corresponding elements of the incoming arguments are not equal or that at least one of the corresponding elements contains zero.

With <code class="code">vec_xlx</code>, <code class="code">index</code> is the offset of the first byte of the element to be extracted.
