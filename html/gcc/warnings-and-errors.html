Each kind has a different purpose: </p> <ul class="itemize mark-none"> <li>
<em class="dfn">Errors</em> report problems that make it impossible to compile your program. GCC reports errors with the source file name and line number where the problem is apparent. </li>
<li>
<em class="dfn">Warnings</em> report other unusual conditions in your code that <em class="emph">may</em> indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does) proceed. Warning messages also report the source file name and line number, but include the text ‘<samp class="samp">warning:</samp>’ to distinguish them from error messages. </li>
</ul> <p>Warnings may indicate danger points where you should check to make sure that your program really does what you intend; or the use of obsolete features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU C or C++. Many warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the <samp class="option">-W</samp> options (for instance, <samp class="option">-Wall</samp> requests a variety of useful warnings). </p>   <p>GCC always tries to compile your program if possible; it never gratuitously rejects a program whose meaning is clear merely because (for instance) it fails to conform to a standard. In some cases, however, the C and C++ standards specify that certain extensions are forbidden, and a diagnostic <em class="emph">must</em> be issued by a conforming compiler. The <samp class="option">-pedantic</samp> option tells GCC to issue warnings in such cases; <samp class="option">-pedantic-errors</samp> says to make them errors instead. This does not mean that <em class="emph">all</em> non-ISO constructs get warnings or errors. </p> <p>See <a class="xref" href="warning-options.html">Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</a>, for more detail on these and related command-line options. </p> </div>  <div class="nav-panel"> <p> Previous: <a href="non-bugs.html">Certain Changes We Don’t Want to Make</a>, Up: <a href="trouble.html">Known Causes of Trouble with GCC</a> [<a href="index.html#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="indices.html" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
