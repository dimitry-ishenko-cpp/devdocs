<p>This function returns the return address of the current function, or of one of its callers. The <var class="var">level</var> argument is number of frames to scan up the call stack. A value of <code class="code">0</code> yields the return address of the current function, a value of <code class="code">1</code> yields the return address of the caller of the current function, and so forth. When inlining the expected behavior is that the function returns the address of the function that is returned to. To work around this behavior use the <code class="code">noinline</code> function attribute. </p> <p>The <var class="var">level</var> argument must be a constant integer. </p> <p>On some machines it may be impossible to determine the return address of any function other than the current one; in such cases, or when the top of the stack has been reached, this function returns an unspecified value. In addition, <code class="code">__builtin_frame_address</code> may be used to determine if the top of the stack has been reached. </p> <p>Additional post-processing of the returned value may be needed, see <code class="code">__builtin_extract_return_addr</code>. </p> <p>The stored representation of the return address in memory may be different from the address returned by <code class="code">__builtin_return_address</code>. For example, on AArch64 the stored address may be mangled with return address signing whereas the address returned by <code class="code">__builtin_return_address</code> is not. </p> <p>Calling this function with a nonzero argument can have unpredictable effects, including crashing the calling program. As a result, calls that are considered unsafe are diagnosed when the <samp class="option">-Wframe-address</samp> option is in effect. Such calls should only be made in debugging situations. </p> <p>On targets where code addresses are representable as <code class="code">void *</code>, </p>

<p>This function is similar to <code class="code">__builtin_return_address</code>, but it returns the address of the function frame rather than the return address of the function. Calling <code class="code">__builtin_frame_address</code> with a value of <code class="code">0</code> yields the frame address of the current function, a value of <code class="code">1</code> yields the frame address of the caller of the current function, and so forth. </p> <p>The frame is the area on the stack that holds local variables and saved registers. The frame address is normally the address of the first word pushed on to the stack by the function. However, the exact definition depends upon the processor and the calling convention. If the processor has a dedicated frame pointer register, and the function has a frame, then <code class="code">__builtin_frame_address</code> returns the value of the frame pointer register. </p> <p>On some machines it may be impossible to determine the frame address of any function other than the current one; in such cases, or when the top of the stack has been reached, this function returns <code class="code">0</code> if the first frame pointer is properly initialized by the startup code. </p> <p>Calling this function with a nonzero argument can have unpredictable effects, including crashing the calling program. As a result, calls that are considered unsafe are diagnosed when the <samp class="option">-Wframe-address</samp> option is in effect. Such calls should only be made in debugging situations. </p>

<p>This function returns the stack pointer register, offset by <code class="code">STACK_ADDRESS_OFFSET</code> if that’s defined. </p> <p>Conceptually, the returned address returned by this built-in function is the boundary between the stack area allocated for use by its caller, and the area that could be modified by a function call, that the caller could safely zero-out before or after (but not during) the call sequence. </p> <p>Arguments for a callee may be preallocated as part of the caller’s stack frame, or allocated on a per-call basis, depending on the target, so they may be on either side of this boundary. </p> <p>Even if the stack pointer is biased, the result is not. The register save area on SPARC is regarded as modifiable by calls, rather than as allocated for use by the caller function, since it is never in use while the caller function itself is running. </p> <p>Red zones that only leaf functions could use are also regarded as modifiable by calls, rather than as allocated for use by the caller. This is only theoretical, since leaf functions do not issue calls, but a constant offset makes this built-in function more predictable. </p>
