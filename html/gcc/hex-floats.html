As a GNU extension, GCC supports this in C90 mode (except in some cases when strictly conforming) and in C++98, C++11 and C++14 modes. In that format the ‘<samp class="samp">0x</samp>’ hex introducer and the ‘<samp class="samp">p</samp>’ or ‘<samp class="samp">P</samp>’ exponent field are mandatory. The exponent is a decimal number that indicates the power of 2 by which the significant part is multiplied. Thus ‘<samp class="samp">0x1.f</samp>’ is 1 15/16, ‘<samp class="samp">p3</samp>’ multiplies it by 8, and the value of <code class="code">0x1.fp3</code> is the same as <code class="code">1.55e1</code>. </p> <p>Unlike for floating-point numbers in the decimal notation the exponent is always required in the hexadecimal notation. Otherwise the compiler would not be able to resolve the ambiguity of, e.g., <code class="code">0x1.f</code>. This could mean <code class="code">1.0f</code> or <code class="code">1.9375</code> since ‘<samp class="samp">f</samp>’ is also the extension for floating-point constants of type <code class="code">float</code>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
