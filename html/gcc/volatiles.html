<h1 class="section" id="When-is-a-Volatile-Object-Accessed_003f">6.47 When is a Volatile Object Accessed?</h1> <div class="section-level-extent" id="Volatiles">        <p>C has the concept of volatile objects. These are normally accessed by pointers and used for accessing hardware or inter-thread communication. The standard encourages compilers to refrain from optimizations concerning accesses to volatile objects, but leaves it implementation defined as to what constitutes a volatile access. The minimum requirement is that at a sequence point all previous accesses to volatile objects have stabilized and no subsequent accesses have occurred. Thus an implementation is free to reorder and combine volatile accesses that occur between sequence points, but cannot do so for accesses across a sequence point. The use of volatile does not allow you to violate the restriction on updating objects multiple times between two sequence points. </p> <p>Accesses to non-volatile objects are not ordered with respect to volatile accesses. You cannot use a volatile object as a memory barrier to order a sequence of writes to non-volatile memory. For instance: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">int *ptr = <var class="var">something</var>;
volatile int vobj;
*ptr = <var class="var">something</var>;
vobj = 1;</pre>
</div> <p>Unless <var class="var">*ptr</var> and <var class="var">vobj</var> can be aliased, it is not guaranteed that the write to <var class="var">*ptr</var> occurs by the time the update of <var class="var">vobj</var> happens. If you need this guarantee, you must use a stronger memory barrier such as: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">int *ptr = <var class="var">something</var>;
volatile int vobj;
*ptr = <var class="var">something</var>;
asm volatile ("" : : : "memory");
vobj = 1;</pre>
</div> <p>A scalar volatile object is read when it is accessed in a void context: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">volatile int *src = <var class="var">somevalue</var>;
*src;</pre>
</div> <p>Such expressions are rvalues, and GCC implements this as a read of the volatile object being pointed to. </p> <p>Assignments are also expressions and have an rvalue. However when assigning to a scalar volatile, the volatile object is not reread, regardless of whether the assignment expression’s rvalue is used or not. If the assignment’s rvalue is used, the value is that assigned to the volatile object. For instance, there is no read of <var class="var">vobj</var> in all the following cases: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">int obj;
volatile int vobj;
vobj = <var class="var">something</var>;
obj = vobj = <var class="var">something</var>;
obj ? vobj = <var class="var">onething</var> : vobj = <var class="var">anotherthing</var>;
obj = (<var class="var">something</var>, vobj = <var class="var">anotherthing</var>);</pre>
</div> <p>If you need to read the volatile object after an assignment has occurred, you must use a separate expression with an intervening sequence point. </p> <p>As bit-fields are not individually addressable, volatile bit-fields may be implicitly read when written to, or when adjacent bit-fields are accessed. Bit-field operations may be optimized such that adjacent bit-fields are only partially accessed, if they straddle a storage unit boundary. For these reasons it is unwise to use volatile bit-fields to access hardware. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
