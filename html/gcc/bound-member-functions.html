If you are using PMFs in an inner loop, you should really reconsider that decision. If that is not an option, you can extract the pointer to the function that would be called for a given object/PMF pair and call it directly inside the inner loop, to save a bit of time. </p> <p>Note that you still pay the penalty for the call through a function pointer; on most modern architectures, such a call defeats the branch prediction features of the CPU. This is also true of normal virtual function calls. </p> <p>The syntax for this extension is </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">extern A a;
extern int (A::*fp)();
typedef int (*fptr)(A *);

fptr p = (fptr)(a.*fp);</pre>
</div> <p>For PMF constants (i.e. expressions of the form ‘<samp class="samp">&amp;Klasse::Member</samp>’), no object is needed to obtain the address of the function. They can be converted to function pointers directly: </p> <div class="example smallexample"> <pre class="example-preformatted" data-language="cpp">fptr p1 = (fptr)(&amp;A::foo);</pre>
</div>  <p>You must specify <samp class="option">-Wno-pmf-conversions</samp> to use this extension. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
