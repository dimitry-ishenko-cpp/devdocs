This is most often used for performing rate limiting on API’s, or restricting the number of attempts a user can make against a form to help prevent brute force attacks. The class itself can be used for anything that you need to throttle based on actions within a set time interval.</p>  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2> <p>The Throttler implements a simplified version of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket">Token Bucket</a> algorithm. This basically treats each action that you want as a bucket. When you call the <code>check()</code> method, you tell it how large the bucket is, and how many tokens it can hold and the time interval. Each <code>check()</code> call uses 1 of the available tokens, by default. Let’s walk through an example to make this clear.</p> <p>Let’s say we want an action to happen once every second. The first call to the Throttler would look like the following. The first parameter is the bucket name, the second parameter the number of tokens the bucket holds, and the third being the amount of time it takes the bucket to refill:</p> <pre data-language="php">$throttler = \Config\Services::throttler();
$throttler-&gt;check($name, 60, MINUTE);
</pre> <p>Here we’re using one of the <a class="reference internal" href="../general/common_functions.html"><span class="doc">global constants</span></a> for the time, to make it a little more readable. This says that the bucket allows 60 actions every minute, or 1 action every second.</p> <p>Let’s say that a third-party script was trying to hit a URL repeatedly. At first, it would be able to use all 60 of those tokens in less than a second. However, after that the Throttler would only allow one action per second, potentially slowing down the requests enough that they attack is no longer worth it.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">For the Throttler class to work, the Cache library must be set up to use a handler other than dummy. For best performance, an in-memory cache, like Redis or Memcached, is recommended.</p> </div>   <h2 id="rate-limiting">Rate Limiting</h2> <p>The Throttler class does not do any rate limiting or request throttling on its own, but is the key to making one work. An example <a class="reference internal" href="../incoming/filters.html"><span class="doc">Filter</span></a> is provided that implements a very simple rate limiting at one request per second per IP address. Here we will run through how it works, and how you could set it up and start using it in your application.</p>  <h3 id="the-code">The Code</h3> <p>You could make your own Throttler filter, at <strong>app/Filters/Throttle.php</strong>, along the lines of:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Filters;

use CodeIgniter\Filters\FilterInterface;
use CodeIgniter\HTTP\RequestInterface;
use CodeIgniter\HTTP\ResponseInterface;
use Config\Services;

class Throttle implements FilterInterface
{
    /**
     * This is a demo implementation of using the Throttler class
     * to implement rate limiting for your application.
     *
     * @param array|null $arguments
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function before(RequestInterface $request, $arguments = null)
    {
        $throttler = Services::throttler();

        // Restrict an IP address to no more than 1 request
        // per second across the entire site.
        if ($throttler-&gt;check(md5($request-&gt;getIPAddress()), 60, MINUTE) === false) {
            return Services::response()-&gt;setStatusCode(429);
        }
    }

    /**
     * We don't have anything to do here.
     *
     * @param array|null $arguments
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function after(RequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response, $arguments = null)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
</pre> <p>When run, this method first grabs an instance of the throttler. Next, it uses the IP address as the bucket name, and sets things to limit them to one request per second. If the throttler rejects the check, returning false, then we return a Response with the status code set to 429 - Too Many Attempts, and the script execution ends before it ever hits the controller. This example will throttle based on a single IP address across all requests made to the site, not per page.</p>   <h3 id="applying-the-filter">Applying the Filter</h3> <p>We don’t necessarily need to throttle every page on the site. For many web applications, this makes the most sense to apply only to POST requests, though API’s might want to limit every request made by a user. In order to apply this to incoming requests, you need to edit <strong>/app/Config/Filters.php</strong> and first add an alias to the filter:</p> <pre data-language="php">public $aliases = [
    ...
    'throttle' =&gt; \App\Filters\Throttle::class,
];
</pre> <p>Next, we assign it to all POST requests made on the site:</p> <pre data-language="php">public $methods = [
    'post' =&gt; ['throttle', 'csrf'],
];
</pre> <p>And that’s all there is to it. Now all POST requests made on the site will have to be rate limited.</p>    <h2 id="class-reference">Class Reference</h2> <dl class="method"> <dt id="check">
