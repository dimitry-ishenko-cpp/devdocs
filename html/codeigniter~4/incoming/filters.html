Unlike <a class="reference internal" href="../extending/events.html"><span class="doc">events</span></a>, you can choose the specific URIs in which the filters will be applied to. Incoming filters may modify the Request while after filters can act on and even modify the Response, allowing for a lot of flexibility and power. Some common examples of tasks that might be performed with filters are:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Performing CSRF protection on the incoming requests</li> <li>Restricting areas of your site based upon their Role</li> <li>Perform rate limiting on certain endpoints</li> <li>Display a “Down for Maintenance” page</li> <li>Perform automatic content negotiation</li> <li>and more…</li> </ul>  <h2 id="creating-a-filter">Creating a Filter</h2> <p>Filters are simple classes that implement <code>CodeIgniter\Filters\FilterInterface</code>. They contain two methods: <code>before()</code> and <code>after()</code> which hold the code that will run before and after the controller respectively. Your class must contain both methods but may leave the methods empty if they are not needed. A skeleton filter class looks like:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Filters;

use CodeIgniter\HTTP\RequestInterface;
use CodeIgniter\HTTP\ResponseInterface;
use CodeIgniter\Filters\FilterInterface;

class MyFilter implements FilterInterface
{
    public function before(RequestInterface $request, $arguments = null)
    {
        // Do something here
    }

    public function after(RequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response, $arguments = null)
    {
        // Do something here
    }
}
</pre>  <h3 id="before-filters">Before Filters</h3> <p>From any filter, you can return the <code>$request</code> object and it will replace the current Request, allowing you to make changes that will still be present when the controller executes.</p> <p>Since before filters are executed prior to your controller being executed, you may at times want to stop the actions in the controller from happening. Also, when you have a series of filters you may also want to stop the execution of the later filters after a certain filter. You can easily do this by returning <strong>any non-empty</strong> result. If the before filter returns an empty result, the controller actions or the later filters will still be executed. An exception to the non-empty result rule is the <code>Request</code> instance. Returning it in the before filter will not stop the execution but only replace the current <code>$request</code> object.</p> <p>This is typically used to perform redirects, like in this example:</p> <pre data-language="php">public function before(RequestInterface $request, $arguments = null)
{
    $auth = service('auth');

    if (! $auth-&gt;isLoggedIn()) {
        return redirect()-&gt;to(site_url('login'));
    }
}
</pre> <p>If a <code>Response</code> instance is returned, the Response will be sent back to the client and script execution will stop. This can be useful for implementing rate limiting for APIs. See <a class="reference internal" href="../libraries/throttler.html"><span class="doc">Throttler</span></a> for an example.</p>   <h3 id="after-filters">After Filters</h3> <p>After filters are nearly identical to before filters, except that you can only return the <code>$response</code> object, and you cannot stop script execution. This does allow you to modify the final output, or simply do something with the final output. This could be used to ensure certain security headers were set the correct way, or to cache the final output, or even to filter the final output with a bad words filter.</p>    <h2 id="configuring-filters">Configuring Filters</h2> <p>Once you’ve created your filters, you need to configure when they get run. This is done in <strong>app/Config/Filters.php</strong>. This file contains four properties that allow you to configure exactly when the filters run.</p>  <h3 id="aliases">$aliases</h3> <p>The <code>$aliases</code> array is used to associate a simple name with one or more fully-qualified class names that are the filters to run:</p> <pre data-language="php">public $aliases = [
    'csrf' =&gt; \CodeIgniter\Filters\CSRF::class,
];
</pre> <p>Aliases are mandatory and if you try to use a full class name later, the system will throw an error. Defining them in this way makes it simple to switch out the class used. Great for when you decided you need to change to a different authentication system since you only change the filter’s class and you’re done.</p> <p>You can combine multiple filters into one alias, making complex sets of filters simple to apply:</p> <pre data-language="php">public $aliases = [
    'apiPrep' =&gt; [
        \App\Filters\Negotiate::class,
        \App\Filters\ApiAuth::class,
    ]
];
</pre> <p>You should define as many aliases as you need.</p>   <h3 id="globals">$globals</h3> <p>The second section allows you to define any filters that should be applied to every request made by the framework. You should take care with how many you use here, since it could have performance implications to have too many run on every request. Filters can be specified by adding their alias to either the before or after array:</p> <pre data-language="php">public $globals = [
    'before' =&gt; [
        'csrf',
    ],
    'after' =&gt; [],
];
</pre> <p>There are times where you want to apply a filter to almost every request, but have a few that should be left alone. One common example is if you need to exclude a few URI’s from the CSRF protection filter to allow requests from third-party websites to hit one or two specific URI’s, while keeping the rest of them protected. To do this, add an array with the ‘except’ key and a uri to match as the value alongside the alias:</p> <pre data-language="php">public $globals = [
    'before' =&gt; [
        'csrf' =&gt; ['except' =&gt; 'api/*'],
    ],
    'after' =&gt; [],
];
</pre> <p>Any place you can use a URI in the filter settings, you can use a regular expression or, like in this example, use an asterisk for a wildcard that will match all characters after that. In this example, any URL’s starting with <code>api/</code> would be exempted from CSRF protection, but the site’s forms would all be protected. If you need to specify multiple URI’s you can use an array of URI patterns:</p> <pre data-language="php">public $globals = [
    'before' =&gt; [
        'csrf' =&gt; ['except' =&gt; ['foo/*', 'bar/*']],
    ],
    'after' =&gt; [],
];
</pre>   <h3 id="methods">$methods</h3> <p>You can apply filters to all requests of a certain HTTP method, like POST, GET, PUT, etc. In this array, you would specify the method name in lowercase. It’s value would be an array of filters to run. Unlike the <code>$globals</code> or the <code>$filters</code> properties, these will only run as before filters:</p> <pre data-language="php">public $methods = [
    'post' =&gt; ['foo', 'bar'],
    'get'  =&gt; ['baz'],
]
</pre> <p>In addition to the standard HTTP methods, this also supports one special case: ‘cli’. The ‘cli’ method would apply to all requests that were run from the command line.</p>   <h3 id="filters">$filters</h3> <p>This property is an array of filter aliases. For each alias, you can specify before and after arrays that contain a list of URI patterns that filter should apply to:</p> <pre data-language="php">public filters = [
    'foo' =&gt; ['before' =&gt; ['admin/*'], 'after' =&gt; ['users/*']],
    'bar' =&gt; ['before' =&gt; ['api/*', 'admin/*']],
];
</pre>   <h3 id="filter-arguments">Filter arguments</h3> <p>When configuring filters, additional arguments may be passed to a filter when setting up the route:</p> <pre data-language="php">$routes-&gt;add('users/delete/(:segment)', 'AdminController::index', ['filter' =&gt; 'admin-auth:dual,noreturn']);
</pre> <p>In this example, the array <code>['dual', 'noreturn']</code> will be passed in <code>$arguments</code> to the filter’s <code>before()</code> and <code>after()</code> implementation methods.</p>    <h2 id="provided-filters">Provided Filters</h2> <p>Three filters are bundled with CodeIgniter4: <code>Honeypot</code>, <code>CSRF</code>, and <code>DebugToolbar</code>.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">The filters are executed in the declared order that is defined in the config file, but there is one exception to this and it concerns the <code>DebugToolbar</code>, which is always executed last. This is because <code>DebugToolbar</code> should be able to register everything that happens in other filters.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
