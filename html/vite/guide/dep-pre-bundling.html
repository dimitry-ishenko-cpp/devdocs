<h1 id="dependency-pre-bundling" tabindex="-1">Dependency Pre-Bundling </h1>
<p>When you run <code>vite</code> for the first time, Vite prebundles your project dependencies before loading your site locally. It is done automatically and transparently by default.</p>
<h2 id="the-why" tabindex="-1">The Why </h2>
<p>This is Vite performing what we call "dependency pre-bundling". This process serves two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>CommonJS and UMD compatibility:</strong> During development, Vite's dev serves all code as native ESM. Therefore, Vite must convert dependencies that are shipped as CommonJS or UMD into ESM first.</p>
<p>When converting CommonJS dependencies, Vite performs smart import analysis so that named imports to CommonJS modules will work as expected even if the exports are dynamically assigned (e.g. React):</p>
<div class="language-js vp-adaptive-theme">
<span class="lang">js</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" style="--shiki-light:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#e1e4e8;--shiki-light-bg:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#24292e;" tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">// works as expected
import React, { useState } from 'react'</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Vite converts ESM dependencies with many internal modules into a single module to improve subsequent page load performance.</p>
<p>Some packages ship their ES modules builds as many separate files importing one another. For example, <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/lodash-es/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>lodash-es</code> has over 600 internal modules</a>! When we do <code>import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'</code>, the browser fires off 600+ HTTP requests at the same time! Even though the server has no problem handling them, the large amount of requests create a network congestion on the browser side, causing the page to load noticeably slower.</p>
<p>By pre-bundling <code>lodash-es</code> into a single module, we now only need one HTTP request instead!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="tip custom-block">
<strong class="custom-block-title">NOTE</strong><p>Dependency pre-bundling only applies in development mode, and uses <code>esbuild</code> to convert dependencies to ESM. In production builds, <code>@rollup/plugin-commonjs</code> is used instead.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="automatic-dependency-discovery" tabindex="-1">Automatic Dependency Discovery </h2>
<p>If an existing cache is not found, Vite will crawl your source code and automatically discover dependency imports (i.e. "bare imports" that expect to be resolved from <code>node_modules</code>) and use these found imports as entry points for the pre-bundle. The pre-bundling is performed with <code>esbuild</code> so it's typically very fast.</p>
<p>After the server has already started, if a new dependency import is encountered that isn't already in the cache, Vite will re-run the dep bundling process and reload the page if needed.</p>
<h2 id="monorepos-and-linked-dependencies" tabindex="-1">Monorepos and Linked Dependencies </h2>
<p>In a monorepo setup, a dependency may be a linked package from the same repo. Vite automatically detects dependencies that are not resolved from <code>node_modules</code> and treats the linked dep as source code. It will not attempt to bundle the linked dep, and will analyze the linked dep's dependency list instead.</p>
<p>However, this requires the linked dep to be exported as ESM. If not, you can add the dependency to <a href="../config/dep-optimization-options.html#optimizedeps-include"><code>optimizeDeps.include</code></a> and <a href="../config/build-options.html#build-commonjsoptions"><code>build.commonjsOptions.include</code></a> in your config.</p>
<div class="language-js vp-adaptive-theme">
<span class="lang">js</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code twoslash lsp" style="--shiki-light:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#e1e4e8;--shiki-light-bg:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#24292e;" tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">export default defineConfig({
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['linked-dep'],
  },
  build: {
    commonjsOptions: {
      include: [/linked-dep/, /node_modules/],
    },
  },
})</pre>
</div>
<p>When making changes to the linked dep, restart the dev server with the <code>--force</code> command line option for the changes to take effect.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-the-behavior" tabindex="-1">Customizing the Behavior </h2>
<p>The default dependency discovery heuristics may not always be desirable. In cases where you want to explicitly include/exclude dependencies from the list, use the <a href="../config/dep-optimization-options.html"><code>optimizeDeps</code> config options</a>.</p>
<p>A typical use case for <code>optimizeDeps.include</code> or <code>optimizeDeps.exclude</code> is when you have an import that is not directly discoverable in the source code. For example, maybe the import is created as a result of a plugin transform. This means Vite won't be able to discover the import on the initial scan - it can only discover it after the file is requested by the browser and transformed. This will cause the server to immediately re-bundle after server start.</p>
<p>Both <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> can be used to deal with this. If the dependency is large (with many internal modules) or is CommonJS, then you should include it; If the dependency is small and is already valid ESM, you can exclude it and let the browser load it directly.</p>
<p>You can further customize esbuild too with the <a href="../config/dep-optimization-options.html#optimizedeps-esbuildoptions"><code>optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions</code> option</a>. For example, adding an esbuild plugin to handle special files in dependencies or changing the <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/#target" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">build <code>target</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="caching" tabindex="-1">Caching </h2>
<h3 id="file-system-cache" tabindex="-1">File System Cache </h3>
<p>Vite caches the pre-bundled dependencies in <code>node_modules/.vite</code>. It determines whether it needs to re-run the pre-bundling step based on a few sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Package manager lockfile content, e.g. <code>package-lock.json</code>, <code>yarn.lock</code>, <code>pnpm-lock.yaml</code> or <code>bun.lockb</code>.</li>
<li>Patches folder modification time.</li>
<li>Relevant fields in your <code>vite.config.js</code>, if present.</li>
<li>
<code>NODE_ENV</code> value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pre-bundling step will only need to be re-run when one of the above has changed.</p>
<p>If for some reason you want to force Vite to re-bundle deps, you can either start the dev server with the <code>--force</code> command line option, or manually delete the <code>node_modules/.vite</code> cache directory.</p>
<h3 id="browser-cache" tabindex="-1">Browser Cache </h3>
<p>Resolved dependency requests are strongly cached with HTTP headers <code>max-age=31536000,immutable</code> to improve page reload performance during dev. Once cached, these requests will never hit the dev server again. They are auto invalidated by the appended version query if a different version is installed (as reflected in your package manager lockfile). If you want to debug your dependencies by making local edits, you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Temporarily disable cache via the Network tab of your browser devtools;</li>
<li>Restart Vite dev server with the <code>--force</code> flag to re-bundle the deps;</li>
<li>Reload the page.</li>
