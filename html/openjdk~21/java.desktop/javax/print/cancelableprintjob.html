This interface extends <a href="docprintjob.html" title="interface in javax.print"><code>DocPrintJob</code></a>. A <code>DocPrintJob</code> implementation returned from a print service implements this interface if the print job can be cancelled. Before trying to cancel a print job, the client needs to test if the <code>DocPrintJob</code> object returned from the print service actually implements this interface. Clients should never assume that a <code>DocPrintJob</code> implements this interface. A print service might support cancellation only for certain types of print data and representation class names. This means that only some of the <code>DocPrintJob</code> objects returned from a service will implement this interface. <p> Service implementors are encouraged to implement this optional interface and to deliver a <a href="event/printjobevent.html#JOB_CANCELED"><code>PrintJobEvent.JOB_CANCELED</code></a> event to any listeners if a job is successfully cancelled with an implementation of this interface. Services should also note that an implementation of this method may be made from a separate client thread than that which made the print request. Thus the implementation of this interface must be made thread safe.</p>

A job may not be able to be cancelled once it has reached and passed some point in its processing. A successful cancellation means only that the entire job was not printed, some portion may already have printed when cancel returns. </p>
<p> The service will throw a <code>PrintException</code> if the cancellation did not succeed. A job which has not yet been submitted for printing should throw this exception. Cancelling an already successfully cancelled Print Job is not considered an error and will always succeed. </p>
<p> Cancellation in some services may be a lengthy process, involving requests to a server and processing of its print queue. Clients may wish to execute cancel in a thread which does not affect application execution.</p>
