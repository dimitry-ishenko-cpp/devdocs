<h1 title="Annotation Interface Experimental" class="title">Annotation Interface Experimental</h1> <section class="class-description" id="class-description">  <pre class="lang-java" data-language="java">@Inherited @Retention(RUNTIME) @Target({FIELD,TYPE}) public @interface Experimental</pre> <div class="block">Annotation that specifies that an element is experimental and may change without notice. <p> Clients that visualize Flight Recorder events should <em>not</em> show the events or fields annotated with the <code>Experimental</code> annotation by default. This annotation allows event producers the freedom to try out new events without committing to them. </p>
<p> Clients may provide a check box (for example, in a preference page) where a user can opt-in to display experimental data. If the user decide to do so, the user interface should mark experimental events or fields so users can distinguish them from non-experimental events. </p>
<p> This annotation is inherited.</p>
