This class represents the definition of the week, for the purpose of providing <a href="temporalfield.html" title="interface in java.time.temporal"><code>TemporalField</code></a> instances. </p>
<p> WeekFields provides five fields, <a href="#dayOfWeek()"><code>dayOfWeek()</code></a>, <a href="#weekOfMonth()"><code>weekOfMonth()</code></a>, <a href="#weekOfYear()"><code>weekOfYear()</code></a>, <a href="#weekOfWeekBasedYear()"><code>weekOfWeekBasedYear()</code></a>, and <a href="#weekBasedYear()"><code>weekBasedYear()</code></a> that provide access to the values from any <a href="temporal.html" title="interface in java.time.temporal">temporal object</a>. </p>
<p> The computations for day-of-week, week-of-month, and week-of-year are based on the <a href="chronofield.html#YEAR">proleptic-year</a>, <a href="chronofield.html#MONTH_OF_YEAR">month-of-year</a>, <a href="chronofield.html#DAY_OF_MONTH">day-of-month</a>, and <a href="chronofield.html#DAY_OF_WEEK">ISO day-of-week</a> which are based on the <a href="chronofield.html#EPOCH_DAY">epoch-day</a> and the chronology. The values may not be aligned with the <a href="chronofield.html#YEAR_OF_ERA">year-of-Era</a> depending on the Chronology. </p>
<p>A week is defined by: </p>
<ul> <li>The first day-of-week. For example, the ISO-8601 standard considers Monday to be the first day-of-week. </li>
<li>The minimal number of days in the first week. For example, the ISO-8601 standard counts the first week as needing at least 4 days. </li>
</ul> Together these two values allow a year or month to be divided into weeks. <h2 id="week-of-month-heading">Week of Month</h2> One field is used: week-of-month. The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a month boundary. The month is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week. The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days. <table class="striped" style="text-align: left"> <caption>Examples of WeekFields</caption> <thead> <tr>

This field is typically used with <a href="#dayOfWeek()"><code>dayOfWeek()</code></a> and <a href="#weekOfWeekBasedYear()"><code>weekOfWeekBasedYear()</code></a>. </p>
<p> Week one(1) is the week starting on the <a href="#getFirstDayOfWeek()"><code>getFirstDayOfWeek()</code></a> where there are at least <a href="#getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()"><code>getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()</code></a> days in the year. Thus, week one may start before the start of the year. If the first week starts after the start of the year then the period before is in the last week of the previous year. </p>
<p> This field can be used with any calendar system. </p>
<p> In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a week-based-year, week-of-year and day-of-week. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle.html#STRICT">strict mode</a>, all three fields are validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-year field is validated to ensure that the resulting week-based-year is the week-based-year requested. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle.html#SMART">smart mode</a>, all three fields are validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year field is validated from 1 to 53, meaning that the resulting date can be in the following week-based-year to that specified. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle.html#LENIENT">lenient mode</a>, the year and day-of-week are validated against the range of valid values. The resulting date is calculated equivalent to the following three stage approach. First, create a date on the first day of the first week in the requested week-based-year. Then take the week-of-week-based-year, subtract one, and add the amount in weeks to the date. Finally, adjust to the correct day-of-week within the localized week.</p>
