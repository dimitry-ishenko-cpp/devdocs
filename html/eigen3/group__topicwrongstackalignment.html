<h1>Compiler making a wrong assumption on stack alignment</h1>      <div> <h4>It appears that this was a GCC bug that has been fixed in GCC 4.5. If you hit this issue, please upgrade to GCC 4.5 and report to us, so we can update this page.</h4> <p>This is an issue that, so far, we met only with GCC on Windows: for instance, MinGW and TDM-GCC.</p> <p>By default, in a function like this,</p> <pre data-language="cpp"><span>void</span> foo()
{
  <a href="classeigen_1_1quaternion.html">Eigen::Quaternionf</a> q;
  <span>//...</span>
}</pre>
<p>GCC assumes that the stack is already 16-byte-aligned so that the object <em>q</em> will be created at a 16-byte-aligned location. For this reason, it doesn't take any special care to explicitly align the object <em>q</em>, as <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a> requires.</p> <p>The problem is that, in some particular cases, this assumption can be wrong on Windows, where the stack is only guaranteed to have 4-byte alignment. Indeed, even though GCC takes care of aligning the stack in the main function and does its best to keep it aligned, when a function is called from another thread or from a binary compiled with another compiler, the stack alignment can be corrupted. This results in the object 'q' being created at an unaligned location, making your program crash with the <a href="group__topicunalignedarrayassert.html">assertion on unaligned arrays</a>. So far we found the three following solutions.</p> <h1>
<a id="sec_sol1"></a> Local solution</h1> <p>A local solution is to mark such a function with this attribute: </p>
<pre data-language="cpp">__attribute__((force_align_arg_pointer)) <span>void</span> foo()
{
  <a href="classeigen_1_1quaternion.html">Eigen::Quaternionf</a> q;
  <span>//...</span>
}
</pre>
<p> Read <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.0/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">this GCC documentation</a> to understand what this does. Of course this should only be done on GCC on Windows, so for portability you'll have to encapsulate this in a macro which you leave empty on other platforms. The advantage of this solution is that you can finely select which function might have a corrupted stack alignment. Of course on the downside this has to be done for every such function, so you may prefer one of the following two global solutions.</p> <h1>
<a id="sec_sol2"></a> Global solutions</h1> <p>A global solution is to edit your project so that when compiling with GCC on Windows, you pass this option to GCC: </p>
<pre data-language="cpp">-mincoming-stack-boundary=2
</pre>
<p> Explanation: this tells GCC that the stack is only required to be aligned to 2^2=4 bytes, so that GCC now knows that it really must take extra care to honor the 16 byte alignment of <a href="group__topicfixedsizevectorizable.html">fixed-size vectorizable Eigen types</a> when needed.</p> <p>Another global solution is to pass this option to gcc: </p>
<pre data-language="cpp">-mstackrealign
</pre>
<p> which has the same effect than adding the <code>force_align_arg_pointer</code> attribute to all functions.</p> <p>These global solutions are easy to use, but note that they may slowdown your program because they lead to extra prologue/epilogue instructions for every function. </p> </div> <div class="_attribution">
