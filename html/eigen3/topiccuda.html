<h1>Using Eigen in CUDA kernels</h1>     <div> <div> <div>
<p>Staring from CUDA 5.5 and <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a> 3.3, it is possible to use <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a>'s matrices, vectors, and arrays for fixed size within CUDA kernels. This is especially useful when working on numerous but small problems. By default, when <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a>'s headers are included within a .cu file compiled by nvcc most <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a>'s functions and methods are prefixed by the <code><b>device</b></code> <code><b>host</b></code> keywords making them callable from both host and device code. This support can be disabled by defining <code>EIGEN_NO_CUDA</code> before including any <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a>'s header. This might be useful to disable some warnings when a .cu file makes use of <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a> on the host side only. However, in both cases, host's SIMD vectorization has to be disabled in .cu files. It is thus <b>strongly</b> <b>recommended</b> to properly move all costly host computation from your .cu files to regular .cpp files.</p> <p>Known issues:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>nvcc</code> with MS Visual Studio does not work (patch welcome)</li> <li>
<code>nvcc</code> 5.5 with gcc-4.7 (or greater) has issues with the standard <code>&lt;limits&gt;</code> header file. To workaround this, you can add the following before including any other files: <pre data-language="cpp"><span>// workaround issue between gcc &gt;= 4.7 and cuda 5.5</span>
<span>#if (defined __GNUC__) &amp;&amp; (__GNUC__&gt;4 || __GNUC_MINOR__&gt;=7)</span>
<span>  #undef _GLIBCXX_ATOMIC_BUILTINS</span>
<span>  #undef _GLIBCXX_USE_INT128</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</pre>
</li> <li>On 64bits system <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a> uses <code>long</code> <code>int</code> as the default type for indexes and sizes. On CUDA device, it would make sense to default to 32 bits <code>int</code>. However, to keep host and CUDA code compatible, this cannot be done automatically by Eigen, and the user is thus required to define <code>EIGEN_DEFAULT_DENSE_INDEX_TYPE</code> to <code>int</code> throughout his code (or only for CUDA code if there is no interaction between host and CUDA code through Eigen's object). </li> </ul> </div>
