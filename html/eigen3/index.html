<p>This is the API documentation for Eigen3. You can <a href="https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/eigen-doc.tgz">download</a> it as a tgz archive for offline reading.</p> <p>For a first contact with <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a>, the best place is to have a look at the <a href="gettingstarted.html">getting started </a> page that show you how to write and compile your first program with <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a>.</p> <p>Then, the <b>quick</b> <b>reference</b> <b>pages</b> give you a quite complete description of the API in a very condensed format that is specially useful to recall the syntax of a particular feature, or to have a quick look at the API. They currently cover the two following feature sets, and more will come in the future:</p>
<ul> <li><a href="group__quickrefpage.html">[QuickRef] Dense matrix and array manipulations </a></li> <li><a href="group__sparsequickrefpage.html">[QuickRef] Sparse linear algebra </a></li> </ul> <p>You're a MatLab user? There is also a <a href="https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/AsciiQuickReference.txt">short ASCII reference</a> with Matlab translations.</p> <p>The <b>main</b> <b>documentation</b> is organized into <em>chapters</em> covering different domains of features. They are themselves composed of <em>user</em> <em>manual</em> pages describing the different features in a comprehensive way, and <em>reference</em> pages that gives you access to the API documentation through the related <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a>'s <em>modules</em> and <em>classes</em>.</p> <p>Under the <a href="usermanual_customizingeigen.html">Extending/Customizing Eigen</a> section, you will find discussions and examples on extending Eigen's features and supporting custom scalar types.</p> <p>Under the <a href="usermanual_generalities.html">General topics</a> section, you will find documentation on more general topics such as preprocessor directives, controlling assertions, multi-threading, MKL support, some <a href="namespaceeigen.html" title="Namespace containing all symbols from the Eigen library.">Eigen</a>'s internal insights, and much more...</p> <p>Finally, do not miss the search engine, useful to quickly get to the documentation of a given class or function.</p> <p>Want more?
