<p>Patch extraction specialized for image processing. This assumes that the input has a least 3 dimensions ordered as follow: 1st dimension: channels (of size d) 2nd dimension: rows (of size r) 3rd dimension: columns (of size c) There can be additional dimensions such as time (for video) or batch (for bulk processing after the first 3. Calling the image patch code with patch_rows and patch_cols is equivalent to calling the regular patch extraction code with parameters d, patch_rows, patch_cols, and 1 for all the additional dimensions. </p> </div>
