<h1>TensorVolumePatch</h1>      <div>  <div>
<p>Patch extraction specialized for processing of volumetric data. This assumes that the input has a least 4 dimensions ordered as follows: </p> <ul> <li>channels</li> <li>planes</li> <li>rows</li> <li>columns</li> <li>(optional) additional dimensions such as time or batch size. Calling the volume patch code with patch_planes, patch_rows, and patch_cols is equivalent to calling the regular patch extraction code with parameters d, patch_planes, patch_rows, patch_cols, and 1 for all the additional dimensions. </li> </ul> </div>
