<h3>template&lt;typename... Gen&gt;<br> class Eigen::StaticSGroup&lt; Gen &gt;</h3> <p>Static symmetry group. </p> <p>This class represents a symmetry group that is known and resolved completely at compile time. Ideally, no run-time penalty is incurred compared to the manual unrolling of the symmetry.</p> <p><b><em>CAUTION:</em></b></p> <p>Do not use this class directly for large symmetry groups. The compiler may run into a limit, or segfault or in the very least will take a very, very, very long time to compile the code. Use the <a href="classeigen_1_1sgroup.html" title="Symmetry group, initialized from template arguments.">SGroup</a> class instead if you want a static group. That class contains logic that will automatically select the <a href="classeigen_1_1dynamicsgroup.html" title="Dynamic symmetry group.">DynamicSGroup</a> class instead if the symmetry group becomes too large. (In that case, unrolling may not even be beneficial.) </p> </div>
