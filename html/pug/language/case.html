<h1>Case</h1> <p>The <code>case</code> statement is a shorthand for JavaScriptâ€™s <code>switch</code> statement. It takes the following form:</p> <pre>- var friends = 10
case friends
  when 0
    p you have no friends
  when 1
    p you have a friend
  default
    p you have #{friends} friends</pre>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;you have 10 friends&lt;/p&gt;</pre> <h2 id="case-fall-through">Case Fall Through </h2> <p>You can use fall through, just as you would in a JavaScript <code>switch</code> statement.</p> <pre>- var friends = 0
case friends
  when 0
  when 1
    p you have very few friends
  default
    p you have #{friends} friends</pre>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;you have very few friends&lt;/p&gt;</pre> <p>The difference, however, is a fall through in JavaScript happens whenever a <code>break</code> statement is not explicitly included; in Pug, it only happens when a block is completely missing.</p> <p>If you would like to not output anything in a specific case, add an explicit unbuffered <code>break</code>:</p> <pre>- var friends = 0
case friends
  when 0
    - break
  when 1
    p you have very few friends
  default
    p you have #{friends} friends</pre>
 <h2 id="block-expansion">Block Expansion </h2> <p>Block expansion may also be used:</p> <pre>&lt;p&gt;you have a friend&lt;/p&gt;</pre> <div class="_attribution">
