The locale is not local to a single thread. Another thread may change the locale at any time, which could cause at a minimum that a given thread is operating in a locale it isn't expecting to be in. On some platforms, segfaults can also occur. The locale change need not be explicit; some operations cause perl to change the locale itself. You are vulnerable simply by having done a <code>"use locale"</code>.</p> <h2 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h2> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@x = sort @y;      # Native-platform/Unicode code point sort order
{
    use locale;
    @x = sort @y;  # Locale-defined sort order
}
@x = sort @y;      # Native-platform/Unicode code point sort order
                   # again</code></pre> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>This pragma tells the compiler to enable (or disable) the use of POSIX locales for built-in operations (for example, LC_CTYPE for regular expressions, LC_COLLATE for string comparison, and LC_NUMERIC for number formatting). Each "use locale" or "no locale" affects statements to the end of the enclosing BLOCK.</p> <p>See <a href="perllocale.html">perllocale</a> for more detailed information on how Perl supports locales.</p> <p>On systems that don't have locales, this pragma will cause your operations to behave as if in the "C" locale; attempts to change the locale will fail.</p><div class="_attribution">
