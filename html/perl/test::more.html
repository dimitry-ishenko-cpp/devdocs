my @status = Test::More::status;</code></pre> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p><b>STOP!</b> If you're just getting started writing tests, have a look at <a href="Test2::Suite.html">Test2::Suite</a> first.</p> <p>This is a drop in replacement for Test::Simple which you can switch to once you get the hang of basic testing.</p> <p>The purpose of this module is to provide a wide range of testing utilities. Various ways to say "ok" with better diagnostics, facilities to skip tests, test future features and compare complicated data structures. While you can do almost anything with a simple <code>ok()</code> function, it doesn't provide good diagnostic output.</p> <h3 id="I-love-it-when-a-plan-comes-together">
I love it when a plan comes together</h3> <p>Before anything else, you need a testing plan. This basically declares how many tests your script is going to run to protect against premature failure.</p> <p>The preferred way to do this is to declare a plan when you <code>use Test::More</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::More tests =&gt; 23;</code></pre> <p>There are cases when you will not know beforehand how many tests your script is going to run. In this case, you can declare your tests at the end.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::More;

... run your tests ...

done_testing( $number_of_tests_run );</code></pre> <p><b>NOTE</b> <code>done_testing()</code> should never be called in an <code>END { ... }</code> block.</p> <p>Sometimes you really don't know how many tests were run, or it's too difficult to calculate. In which case you can leave off $number_of_tests_run.</p> <p>In some cases, you'll want to completely skip an entire testing script.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::More skip_all =&gt; $skip_reason;</code></pre> <p>Your script will declare a skip with the reason why you skipped and exit immediately with a zero (success). See <a href="Test::Harness.html">Test::Harness</a> for details.</p> <p>If you want to control what functions Test::More will export, you have to use the 'import' option. For example, to import everything but 'fail', you'd do:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::More tests =&gt; 23, import =&gt; ['!fail'];</code></pre> <p>Alternatively, you can use the <code>plan()</code> function. Useful for when you have to calculate the number of tests.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::More;
plan tests =&gt; keys %Stuff * 3;</code></pre> <p>or for deciding between running the tests at all:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::More;
if( $^O eq 'MacOS' ) {
    plan skip_all =&gt; 'Test irrelevant on MacOS';
}
else {
    plan tests =&gt; 42;
}</code></pre> <dl> <dt id="done_testing"><b>done_testing</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>done_testing();
done_testing($number_of_tests);</code></pre> <p>If you don't know how many tests you're going to run, you can issue the plan when you're done running tests.</p> <p>$number_of_tests is the same as <code>plan()</code>, it's the number of tests you expected to run. You can omit this, in which case the number of tests you ran doesn't matter, just the fact that your tests ran to conclusion.</p> <p>This is safer than and replaces the "no_plan" plan.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> You must never put <code>done_testing()</code> inside an <code>END { ... }</code> block. The plan is there to ensure your test does not exit before testing has completed. If you use an END block you completely bypass this protection.</p> </dd> </dl> <h3 id="Test-names">
Test names</h3> <p>By convention, each test is assigned a number in order. This is largely done automatically for you. However, it's often very useful to assign a name to each test. Which would you rather see:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">ok 4
not ok 5
ok 6</code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">ok 4 - basic multi-variable
not ok 5 - simple exponential
ok 6 - force == mass * acceleration</code></pre> <p>The later gives you some idea of what failed. It also makes it easier to find the test in your script, simply search for "simple exponential".</p> <p>All test functions take a name argument. It's optional, but highly suggested that you use it.</p> <h3 id="I'm-ok,-you're-not-ok.">
I'm ok, you're not ok.</h3> <p>The basic purpose of this module is to print out either "ok #" or "not ok #" depending on if a given test succeeded or failed. Everything else is just gravy.</p> <p>All of the following print "ok" or "not ok" depending on if the test succeeded or failed. They all also return true or false, respectively.</p> <dl> <dt id="ok"><b>ok</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>ok($got eq $expected, $test_name);</code></pre> <p>This simply evaluates any expression (<code>$got eq $expected</code> is just a simple example) and uses that to determine if the test succeeded or failed. A true expression passes, a false one fails. Very simple.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>ok( $exp{9} == 81,                   'simple exponential' );
ok( Film-&gt;can('db_Main'),            'set_db()' );
ok( $p-&gt;tests == 4,                  'saw tests' );
ok( !grep(!defined $_, @items),      'all items defined' );</code></pre> <p>(Mnemonic: "This is ok.")</p> <p>$test_name is a very short description of the test that will be printed out. It makes it very easy to find a test in your script when it fails and gives others an idea of your intentions. $test_name is optional, but we <b>very</b> strongly encourage its use.</p> <p>Should an <code>ok()</code> fail, it will produce some diagnostics:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">not ok 18 - sufficient mucus
#   Failed test 'sufficient mucus'
#   in foo.t at line 42.</code></pre> <p>This is the same as <a href="Test::Simple.html">Test::Simple</a>'s <code>ok()</code> routine.</p> </dd> <dt id="is"><b>is</b></dt>  <dt id="isnt"><b>isnt</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>is  ( $got, $expected, $test_name );
isnt( $got, $expected, $test_name );</code></pre> <p>Similar to <code>ok()</code>, <code>is()</code> and <code>isnt()</code> compare their two arguments with <code>eq</code> and <code>ne</code> respectively and use the result of that to determine if the test succeeded or failed. So these:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code># Is the ultimate answer 42?
is( ultimate_answer(), 42,          "Meaning of Life" );

# $foo isn't empty
isnt( $foo, '',     "Got some foo" );</code></pre> <p>are similar to these:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>ok( ultimate_answer() eq 42,        "Meaning of Life" );
ok( $foo ne '',     "Got some foo" );</code></pre> <p><code>undef</code> will only ever match <code>undef</code>. So you can test a value against <code>undef</code> like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>is($not_defined, undef, "undefined as expected");</code></pre> <p>(Mnemonic: "This is that." "This isn't that.")</p> <p>So why use these? They produce better diagnostics on failure. <code>ok()</code> cannot know what you are testing for (beyond the name), but <code>is()</code> and <code>isnt()</code> know what the test was and why it failed. For example this test:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $foo = 'waffle';  my $bar = 'yarblokos';
is( $foo, $bar,   'Is foo the same as bar?' );</code></pre> <p>Will produce something like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">not ok 17 - Is foo the same as bar?
#   Failed test 'Is foo the same as bar?'
#   in foo.t at line 139.
#          got: 'waffle'
#     expected: 'yarblokos'</code></pre> <p>So you can figure out what went wrong without rerunning the test.</p> <p>You are encouraged to use <code>is()</code> and <code>isnt()</code> over <code>ok()</code> where possible, however do not be tempted to use them to find out if something is true or false!</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code># XXX BAD!
is( exists $brooklyn{tree}, 1, 'A tree grows in Brooklyn' );</code></pre> <p>This does not check if <code>exists $brooklyn{tree}</code> is true, it checks if it returns 1. Very different. Similar caveats exist for false and 0. In these cases, use <code>ok()</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>ok( exists $brooklyn{tree},    'A tree grows in Brooklyn' );</code></pre> <p>A simple call to <code>isnt()</code> usually does not provide a strong test but there are cases when you cannot say much more about a value than that it is different from some other value:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>new_ok $obj, "Foo";

my $clone = $obj-&gt;clone;
isa_ok $obj, "Foo", "Foo-&gt;clone";

isnt $obj, $clone, "clone() produces a different object";</code></pre> <p>Historically we supported an <code>isn't()</code> function as an alias of <code>isnt()</code>, however in Perl 5.37.9 support for the use of aprostrophe as a package separator was deprecated and by Perl 5.42.0 support for it will have been removed completely. Accordingly use of <code>isn't()</code> is also deprecated, and will produce warnings when used unless 'deprecated' warnings are specifically disabled in the scope where it is used. You are strongly advised to migrate to using <code>isnt()</code> instead.</p> </dd> <dt id="like"><b>like</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>like( $got, qr/expected/, $test_name );</code></pre> <p>Similar to <code>ok()</code>, <code>like()</code> matches $got against the regex <code>qr/expected/</code>.</p> <p>So this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>like($got, qr/expected/, 'this is like that');</code></pre> <p>is similar to:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>ok( $got =~ m/expected/, 'this is like that');</code></pre> <p>(Mnemonic "This is like that".)</p> <p>The second argument is a regular expression. It may be given as a regex reference (i.e. <code>qr//</code>) or (for better compatibility with older perls) as a string that looks like a regex (alternative delimiters are currently not supported):</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>like( $got, '/expected/', 'this is like that' );</code></pre> <p>Regex options may be placed on the end (<code>'/expected/i'</code>).</p> <p>Its advantages over <code>ok()</code> are similar to that of <code>is()</code> and <code>isnt()</code>. Better diagnostics on failure.</p> </dd> <dt id="unlike"><b>unlike</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>unlike( $got, qr/expected/, $test_name );</code></pre> <p>Works exactly as <code>like()</code>, only it checks if $got <b>does not</b> match the given pattern.</p> </dd> <dt id="cmp_ok"><b>cmp_ok</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>cmp_ok( $got, $op, $expected, $test_name );</code></pre> <p>Halfway between <code>ok()</code> and <code>is()</code> lies <code>cmp_ok()</code>. This allows you to compare two arguments using any binary perl operator. The test passes if the comparison is true and fails otherwise.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code># ok( $got eq $expected );
cmp_ok( $got, 'eq', $expected, 'this eq that' );

# ok( $got == $expected );
cmp_ok( $got, '==', $expected, 'this == that' );

# ok( $got &amp;&amp; $expected );
cmp_ok( $got, '&amp;&amp;', $expected, 'this &amp;&amp; that' );
...etc...</code></pre> <p>Its advantage over <code>ok()</code> is when the test fails you'll know what $got and $expected were:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">not ok 1
#   Failed test in foo.t at line 12.
#     '23'
#         &amp;&amp;
#     undef</code></pre> <p>It's also useful in those cases where you are comparing numbers and <code>is()</code>'s use of <code>eq</code> will interfere:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>cmp_ok( $big_hairy_number, '==', $another_big_hairy_number );</code></pre> <p>It's especially useful when comparing greater-than or smaller-than relation between values:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>cmp_ok( $some_value, '&lt;=', $upper_limit );</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="can_ok"><b>can_ok</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>can_ok($module, @methods);
can_ok($object, @methods);</code></pre> <p>Checks to make sure the $module or $object can do these @methods (works with functions, too).</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>can_ok('Foo', qw(this that whatever));</code></pre> <p>is almost exactly like saying:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>ok( Foo-&gt;can('this') &amp;&amp; 
    Foo-&gt;can('that') &amp;&amp; 
    Foo-&gt;can('whatever') 
  );</code></pre> <p>only without all the typing and with a better interface. Handy for quickly testing an interface.</p> <p>No matter how many @methods you check, a single <code>can_ok()</code> call counts as one test. If you desire otherwise, use:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>foreach my $meth (@methods) {
    can_ok('Foo', $meth);
}</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="isa_ok"><b>isa_ok</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>isa_ok($object,   $class, $object_name);
isa_ok($subclass, $class, $object_name);
isa_ok($ref,      $type,  $ref_name);</code></pre> <p>Checks to see if the given <code>$object-&gt;isa($class)</code>. Also checks to make sure the object was defined in the first place. Handy for this sort of thing:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $obj = Some::Module-&gt;new;
isa_ok( $obj, 'Some::Module' );</code></pre> <p>where you'd otherwise have to write</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $obj = Some::Module-&gt;new;
ok( defined $obj &amp;&amp; $obj-&gt;isa('Some::Module') );</code></pre> <p>to safeguard against your test script blowing up.</p> <p>You can also test a class, to make sure that it has the right ancestor:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>isa_ok( 'Vole', 'Rodent' );</code></pre> <p>It works on references, too:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>isa_ok( $array_ref, 'ARRAY' );</code></pre> <p>The diagnostics of this test normally just refer to 'the object'. If you'd like them to be more specific, you can supply an $object_name (for example 'Test customer').</p> </dd> <dt id="new_ok"><b>new_ok</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $obj = new_ok( $class );
my $obj = new_ok( $class =&gt; \@args );
my $obj = new_ok( $class =&gt; \@args, $object_name );</code></pre> <p>A convenience function which combines creating an object and calling <code>isa_ok()</code> on that object.</p> <p>It is basically equivalent to:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $obj = $class-&gt;new(@args);
isa_ok $obj, $class, $object_name;</code></pre> <p>If @args is not given, an empty list will be used.</p> <p>This function only works on <code>new()</code> and it assumes <code>new()</code> will return just a single object which isa <code>$class</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id="subtest"><b>subtest</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>subtest $name =&gt; \&amp;code, @args;</code></pre> <p><code>subtest()</code> runs the &amp;code as its own little test with its own plan and its own result. The main test counts this as a single test using the result of the whole subtest to determine if its ok or not ok.</p> <p>For example...</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code> use Test::More tests =&gt; 3;

 pass("First test");

 subtest 'An example subtest' =&gt; sub {
     plan tests =&gt; 2;

     pass("This is a subtest");
     pass("So is this");
 };

 pass("Third test");</code></pre> <p>This would produce.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">1..3
ok 1 - First test
    # Subtest: An example subtest
    1..2
    ok 1 - This is a subtest
    ok 2 - So is this
ok 2 - An example subtest
ok 3 - Third test</code></pre> <p>A subtest may call <code>skip_all</code>. No tests will be run, but the subtest is considered a skip.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>subtest 'skippy' =&gt; sub {
    plan skip_all =&gt; 'cuz I said so';
    pass('this test will never be run');
};</code></pre> <p>Returns true if the subtest passed, false otherwise.</p> <p>Due to how subtests work, you may omit a plan if you desire. This adds an implicit <code>done_testing()</code> to the end of your subtest. The following two subtests are equivalent:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>subtest 'subtest with implicit done_testing()', sub {
    ok 1, 'subtests with an implicit done testing should work';
    ok 1, '... and support more than one test';
    ok 1, '... no matter how many tests are run';
};

subtest 'subtest with explicit done_testing()', sub {
    ok 1, 'subtests with an explicit done testing should work';
    ok 1, '... and support more than one test';
    ok 1, '... no matter how many tests are run';
    done_testing();
};</code></pre> <p>Extra arguments given to <code>subtest</code> are passed to the callback. For example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub my_subtest {
    my $range = shift;
    ...
}

for my $range (1, 10, 100, 1000) {
    subtest "testing range $range", \&amp;my_subtest, $range;
}</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="pass"><b>pass</b></dt>  <dt id="fail"><b>fail</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>pass($test_name);
fail($test_name);</code></pre> <p>Sometimes you just want to say that the tests have passed. Usually the case is you've got some complicated condition that is difficult to wedge into an <code>ok()</code>. In this case, you can simply use <code>pass()</code> (to declare the test ok) or fail (for not ok). They are synonyms for <code>ok(1)</code> and <code>ok(0)</code>.</p> <p>Use these very, very, very sparingly.</p> </dd> </dl> <h3 id="Module-tests">
Module tests</h3> <p>Sometimes you want to test if a module, or a list of modules, can successfully load. For example, you'll often want a first test which simply loads all the modules in the distribution to make sure they work before going on to do more complicated testing.</p> <p>For such purposes we have <code>use_ok</code> and <code>require_ok</code>.</p> <dl> <dt id="require_ok"><b>require_ok</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>require_ok($module);
require_ok($file);</code></pre> <p>Tries to <code>require</code> the given $module or $file. If it loads successfully, the test will pass. Otherwise it fails and displays the load error.</p> <p><code>require_ok</code> will guess whether the input is a module name or a filename.</p> <p>No exception will be thrown if the load fails.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code># require Some::Module
require_ok "Some::Module";

# require "Some/File.pl";

It will cause the test to stop.</p> <p>It's recommended that you run <code>use_ok()</code> inside a BEGIN block so its functions are exported at compile-time and prototypes are properly honored.</p> <p>If @imports are given, they are passed through to the use. So this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">BEGIN { use_ok('Some::Module', qw(foo bar)) }</code></pre> <p>is like doing this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Some::Module qw(foo bar);</code></pre> <p>Version numbers can be checked like so:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext"># Just like "use Some::Module 1.02"

Complex data structures</h3> <p>Not everything is a simple eq check or regex. There are times you need to see if two data structures are equivalent.

If the two structures are different, it will display the place where they start differing.</p> <p><code>is_deeply()</code> compares the dereferenced values of references, the references themselves (except for their type) are ignored. This means aspects such as blessing and ties are not considered "different".</p> <p><code>is_deeply()</code> currently has very limited handling of function reference and globs. It merely checks if they have the same referent. This may improve in the future.</p> <p><a href="Test::Differences.html">Test::Differences</a> and <a href="Test::Deep.html">Test::Deep</a> provide more in-depth functionality along these lines.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b> is_deeply() has limitations when it comes to comparing strings and refs:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $path = path('.');

# Since there's no foo, check that /etc/bar is set up right.</code></pre> <p>You might remember <code>ok() or diag()</code> with the mnemonic <code>open() or die()</code>.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b> The exact formatting of the diagnostic output is still changing, but it is guaranteed that whatever you throw at it won't interfere with the test.</p> </dd> <dt id="note"><b>note</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>note(@diagnostic_message);</code></pre> <p>Like <code>diag()</code>, except the message will not be seen when the test is run in a harness.

Some::Class-&gt;method(%args);</code></pre> </dd> </dl> <h3 id="Conditional-tests">
Conditional tests</h3> <p>Sometimes running a test under certain conditions will cause the test script to die. A certain function or method isn't implemented (such as <code>fork()</code> on MacOS), some resource isn't available (like a net connection) or a module isn't available. In these cases it's necessary to skip tests, or declare that they are supposed to fail but will work in the future (a todo test).</p> <p>For more details on the mechanics of skip and todo tests see <a href="Test::Harness.html">Test::Harness</a>.</p> <p>The way Test::More handles this is with a named block. Basically, a block of tests which can be skipped over or made todo. It's best if I just show you...</p> <dl> <dt id="SKIP:-BLOCK">
<b>SKIP: BLOCK</b>
</dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>SKIP: {
    skip $why, $how_many if $condition;

    ...normal testing code goes here...
}</code></pre> <p>This declares a block of tests that might be skipped, $how_many tests there are, $why and under what $condition to skip them. An example is the easiest way to illustrate:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>SKIP: {
    eval { require HTML::Lint };

    skip "HTML::Lint not installed", 2 if $@;

    my $lint = new HTML::Lint;
    isa_ok( $lint, "HTML::Lint" );

    $lint-&gt;parse( $html );
    is( $lint-&gt;errors, 0, "No errors found in HTML" );
}</code></pre> <p>If the user does not have HTML::Lint installed, the whole block of code <i>won't be run at all</i>. Test::More will output special ok's which Test::Harness interprets as skipped, but passing, tests.</p> <p>It's important that $how_many accurately reflects the number of tests in the SKIP block so the # of tests run will match up with your plan. If your plan is <code>no_plan</code> $how_many is optional and will default to 1.</p> <p>It's perfectly safe to nest SKIP blocks. Each SKIP block must have the label <code>SKIP</code>, or Test::More can't work its magic.</p> <p>You don't skip tests which are failing because there's a bug in your program, or for which you don't yet have code written. For that you use TODO. Read on.</p> </dd> <dt id="TODO:-BLOCK">
<b>TODO: BLOCK</b>
</dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>TODO: {
    local $TODO = $why if $condition;

    ...normal testing code goes here...
}</code></pre> <p>Declares a block of tests you expect to fail and $why. Perhaps it's because you haven't fixed a bug or haven't finished a new feature:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>TODO: {
    local $TODO = "URI::Geller not finished";

    my $card = "Eight of clubs";
    is( URI::Geller-&gt;your_card, $card, 'Is THIS your card?' );

    my $spoon;
    URI::Geller-&gt;bend_spoon;
    is( $spoon, 'bent',    "Spoon bending, that's original" );
}</code></pre> <p>With a todo block, the tests inside are expected to fail. Test::More will run the tests normally, but print out special flags indicating they are "todo". <a href="Test::Harness.html">Test::Harness</a> will interpret failures as being ok. Should anything succeed, it will report it as an unexpected success. You then know the thing you had todo is done and can remove the TODO flag.</p> <p>The nice part about todo tests, as opposed to simply commenting out a block of tests, is that it is like having a programmatic todo list. You know how much work is left to be done, you're aware of what bugs there are, and you'll know immediately when they're fixed.</p> <p>Once a todo test starts succeeding, simply move it outside the block. When the block is empty, delete it.</p> <p>Note that, if you leave $TODO unset or undef, Test::More reports failures as normal. This can be useful to mark the tests as expected to fail only in certain conditions, e.g.:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>TODO: {
    local $TODO = "$^O doesn't work yet. :(" if !_os_is_supported($^O);

    ...
}</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="todo_skip"><b>todo_skip</b></dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>TODO: {
    todo_skip $why, $how_many if $condition;

    ...normal testing code...
}</code></pre> <p>With todo tests, it's best to have the tests actually run. That way you'll know when they start passing. Sometimes this isn't possible. Often a failing test will cause the whole program to die or hang, even inside an <code>eval BLOCK</code> with and using <code>alarm</code>. In these extreme cases you have no choice but to skip over the broken tests entirely.</p> <p>The syntax and behavior is similar to a <code>SKIP: BLOCK</code> except the tests will be marked as failing but todo. <a href="Test::Harness.html">Test::Harness</a> will interpret them as passing.</p> </dd> <dt id="When-do-I-use-SKIP-vs.-TODO?">
