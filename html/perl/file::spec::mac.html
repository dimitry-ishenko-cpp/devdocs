catdir()</dt> <dd> <p>Concatenate two or more directory names to form a path separated by colons (":") ending with a directory. Resulting paths are <b>relative</b> by default, but can be forced to be absolute (but avoid this, see below). Automatically puts a trailing ":" on the end of the complete path, because that's what's done in MacPerl's environment and helps to distinguish a file path from a directory path.</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Beginning with version 1.3 of this module, the resulting path is relative by default and <i>not</i> absolute. This decision was made due to portability reasons. Since <code>File::Spec-&gt;catdir()</code> returns relative paths on all other operating systems, it will now also follow this convention on Mac OS. Note that this may break some existing scripts.</p> <p>The intended purpose of this routine is to concatenate <i>directory names</i>. But because of the nature of Macintosh paths, some additional possibilities are allowed to make using this routine give reasonable results for some common situations. In other words, you are also allowed to concatenate <i>paths</i> instead of directory names (strictly speaking, a string like ":a" is a path, but not a name, since it contains a punctuation character ":").</p> <p>So, beside calls like</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">catdir("a") = ":a:"
catdir("a","b") = ":a:b:"
catdir() = ""                    (special case)</code></pre> <p>calls like the following</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">catdir(":a:") = ":a:"
catdir(":a","b") = ":a:b:"
catdir(":a:","b") = ":a:b:"
catdir(":a:",":b:") = ":a:b:"
catdir(":") = ":"</code></pre> <p>are allowed.</p> <p>Here are the rules that are used in <code>catdir()</code>; note that we try to be as compatible as possible to Unix:</p> <ol> <li>
<p>The resulting path is relative by default, i.e. the resulting path will have a leading colon.</p> </li> <li>
<p>A trailing colon is added automatically to the resulting path, to denote a directory.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Generally, each argument has one leading ":" and one trailing ":" removed (if any). They are then joined together by a ":". Special treatment applies for arguments denoting updir paths like "::lib:", see (4), or arguments consisting solely of colons ("colon paths"), see (5).</p> </li> <li>
<p>When an updir path like ":::lib::" is passed as argument, the number of directories to climb up is handled correctly, not removing leading or trailing colons when necessary. E.g.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">catdir(":::a","::b","c")    = ":::a::b:c:"
catdir(":::a::","::b","c")  = ":::a:::b:c:"</code></pre> </li> <li>
<p>Adding a colon ":" or empty string "" to a path at <i>any</i> position doesn't alter the path, i.e. these arguments are ignored. (When a "" is passed as the first argument, it has a special meaning, see (6)). This way, a colon ":" is handled like a "." (curdir) on Unix, while an empty string "" is generally ignored (see <a href="File::Spec::Unix.html#canonpath%28%29">"canonpath()" in File::Spec::Unix</a> ). Likewise, a "::" is handled like a ".." (updir), and a ":::" is handled like a "../.." etc. E.g.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">catdir("a",":",":","b")   = ":a:b:"
catdir("a",":","::",":b") = ":a::b:"</code></pre> </li> <li>
<p>If the first argument is an empty string "" or is a volume name, i.e. matches the pattern /^[^:]+:/, the resulting path is <b>absolute</b>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Passing an empty string "" as the first argument to <code>catdir()</code> is like passing<code>File::Spec-&gt;rootdir()</code> as the first argument, i.e.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">catdir("","a","b")          is the same as

catdir(rootdir(),"a","b").</code></pre> <p>This is true on Unix, where <code>catdir("","a","b")</code> yields "/a/b" and <code>rootdir()</code> is "/". Note that <code>rootdir()</code> on Mac OS is the startup volume, which is the closest in concept to Unix' "/". This should help to run existing scripts originally written for Unix.</p> </li> <li>
<p>For absolute paths, some cleanup is done, to ensure that the volume name isn't immediately followed by updirs. This is invalid, because this would go beyond "root". Generally, these cases are handled like their Unix counterparts:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>Unix:
   Unix-&gt;catdir("","")                 =  "/"
   Unix-&gt;catdir("",".")                =  "/"
   Unix-&gt;catdir("","..")               =  "/"        # can't go
                                                     # beyond root
   Unix-&gt;catdir("",".","..","..","a")  =  "/a"
Mac:
   Mac-&gt;catdir("","")                  =  rootdir()  # (e.g. "HD:")
   Mac-&gt;catdir("",":")                 =  rootdir()
   Mac-&gt;catdir("","::")                =  rootdir()  # can't go
                                                     # beyond root
   Mac-&gt;catdir("",":","::","::","a")   =  rootdir() . "a:"
                                                   # (e.g. "HD:a:")</code></pre> <p>However, this approach is limited to the first arguments following "root" (again, see <a href="File::Spec::Unix.html#canonpath%28%29">"canonpath()" in File::Spec::Unix</a>. If there are more arguments that move up the directory tree, an invalid path going beyond root can be created.</p> </li> </ol> <p>As you've seen, you can force <code>catdir()</code> to create an absolute path by passing either an empty string or a path that begins with a volume name as the first argument. However, you are strongly encouraged not to do so, since this is done only for backward compatibility. Newer versions of File::Spec come with a method called <code>catpath()</code> (see below), that is designed to offer a portable solution for the creation of absolute paths. It takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. While <code>catdir()</code> is still suitable for the concatenation of <i>directory names</i>, you are encouraged to use <code>catpath()</code> to concatenate <i>volume names</i> and <i>directory paths</i>. E.g.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$dir      = File::Spec-&gt;catdir("tmp","sources");
$abs_path = File::Spec-&gt;catpath("MacintoshHD:", $dir,"");</code></pre> <p>yields</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">"MacintoshHD:tmp:sources:" .</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="catfile">catfile</dt> <dd> <p>Concatenate one or more directory names and a filename to form a complete path ending with a filename. Resulting paths are <b>relative</b> by default, but can be forced to be absolute (but avoid this).</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Beginning with version 1.3 of this module, the resulting path is relative by default and <i>not</i> absolute. This decision was made due to portability reasons. Since <code>File::Spec-&gt;catfile()</code> returns relative paths on all other operating systems, it will now also follow this convention on Mac OS. Note that this may break some existing scripts.</p> <p>The last argument is always considered to be the file portion. Since <code>catfile()</code> uses <code>catdir()</code> (see above) for the concatenation of the directory portions (if any), the following with regard to relative and absolute paths is true:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">catfile("")     = ""
catfile("file") = "file"</code></pre> <p>but</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">catfile("","")        = rootdir()         # (e.g. "HD:")
catfile("","file")    = rootdir() . file  # (e.g. "HD:file")
catfile("HD:","file") = "HD:file"</code></pre> <p>This means that <code>catdir()</code> is called only when there are two or more arguments, as one might expect.</p> <p>Note that the leading ":" is removed from the filename, so that</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">catfile("a","b","file")  = ":a:b:file"    and

catfile("a","b",":file") = ":a:b:file"</code></pre> <p>give the same answer.</p> <p>To concatenate <i>volume names</i>, <i>directory paths</i> and <i>filenames</i>, you are encouraged to use <code>catpath()</code> (see below).</p> </dd> <dt id="curdir">curdir</dt> <dd> <p>Returns a string representing the current directory.

On Mac OS, this is "::".</p> </dd> <dt id="file_name_is_absolute">file_name_is_absolute</dt> <dd> <p>Takes as argument a path and returns true, if it is an absolute path. If the path has a leading ":", it's a relative path. Otherwise, it's an absolute path, unless the path doesn't contain any colons, i.e. it's a name like "a". In this particular case, the path is considered to be relative (i.e. it is considered to be a filename). Use ":" in the appropriate place in the path if you want to distinguish unambiguously. As a special case, the filename '' is always considered to be absolute. Note that with version 1.2 of File::Spec::Mac, this does no longer consult the local filesystem.</p> <p>E.g.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>File::Spec-&gt;file_name_is_absolute("a");         # false (relative)
File::Spec-&gt;file_name_is_absolute(":a:b:");     # false (relative)

                                                # true (absolute)

The directory portion is always returned with a leading (to denote a relative path) and a trailing ":" (to denote a directory). The file portion is always returned <i>without</i> a leading ":".

Consider using <code>splitpath()</code> otherwise.</p> <p>Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty directory names (<code>""</code>) can be returned.
