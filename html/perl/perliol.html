#include &lt;perliol.h&gt;</code></pre> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>This document describes the behavior and implementation of the PerlIO abstraction described in <a href="perlapio.html">perlapio</a> when <code>USE_PERLIO</code> is defined.</p> <h3 id="History-and-Background">
History and Background</h3> <p>The PerlIO abstraction was introduced in perl5.003_02 but languished as just an abstraction until perl5.7.0. However during that time a number of perl extensions switched to using it, so the API is mostly fixed to maintain (source) compatibility.</p> <p>The aim of the implementation is to provide the PerlIO API in a flexible and platform neutral manner. It is also a trial of an "Object Oriented C, with vtables" approach which may be applied to Raku.</p> <h3 id="Basic-Structure">
Basic Structure</h3> <p>PerlIO is a stack of layers.</p> <p>The low levels of the stack work with the low-level operating system calls (file descriptors in C) getting bytes in and out, the higher layers of the stack buffer, filter, and otherwise manipulate the I/O, and return characters (or bytes) to Perl. Terms <i>above</i> and <i>below</i> are used to refer to the relative positioning of the stack layers.</p> <p>A layer contains a "vtable", the table of I/O operations (at C level a table of function pointers), and status flags. The functions in the vtable implement operations like "open", "read", and "write".</p> <p>When I/O, for example "read", is requested, the request goes from Perl first down the stack using "read" functions of each layer, then at the bottom the input is requested from the operating system services, then the result is returned up the stack, finally being interpreted as Perl data.</p> <p>The requests do not necessarily go always all the way down to the operating system: that's where PerlIO buffering comes into play.</p> <p>When you do an open() and specify extra PerlIO layers to be deployed, the layers you specify are "pushed" on top of the already existing default stack. One way to see it is that "operating system is on the left" and "Perl is on the right".</p> <p>What exact layers are in this default stack depends on a lot of things: your operating system, Perl version, Perl compile time configuration, and Perl runtime configuration. See <a href="perlio.html">PerlIO</a>, <a href="perlrun.html#PERLIO">"PERLIO" in perlrun</a>, and <a href="open.html">open</a> for more information.</p> <p>binmode() operates similarly to open(): by default the specified layers are pushed on top of the existing stack.</p> <p>However, note that even as the specified layers are "pushed on top" for open() and binmode(), this doesn't mean that the effects are limited to the "top": PerlIO layers can be very 'active' and inspect and affect layers also deeper in the stack. As an example there is a layer called "raw" which repeatedly "pops" layers until it reaches the first layer that has declared itself capable of handling binary data. The "pushed" layers are processed in left-to-right order.</p> <p>sysopen() operates (unsurprisingly) at a lower level in the stack than open(). For example in Unix or Unix-like systems sysopen() operates directly at the level of file descriptors: in the terms of PerlIO layers, it uses only the "unix" layer, which is a rather thin wrapper on top of the Unix file descriptors.</p> <h3 id="Layers-vs-Disciplines">
Layers vs Disciplines</h3> <p>Initial discussion of the ability to modify IO streams behaviour used the term "discipline" for the entities which were added. This came (I believe) from the use of the term in "sfio", which in turn borrowed it from "line disciplines" on Unix terminals. However, this document (and the C code) uses the term "layer".</p> <p>This is, I hope, a natural term given the implementation, and should avoid connotations that are inherent in earlier uses of "discipline" for things which are rather different.</p> <h3 id="Data-Structures">
Data Structures</h3> <p>The basic data structure is a PerlIOl:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>typedef struct _PerlIO PerlIOl;
typedef struct _PerlIO_funcs PerlIO_funcs;
typedef PerlIOl *PerlIO;

struct _PerlIO
{
 PerlIOl *	next;       /* Lower layer */
 PerlIO_funcs *	tab;        /* Functions for this layer */
 U32		flags;      /* Various flags for state */
};</code></pre> <p>A <code>PerlIOl *</code> is a pointer to the struct, and the <i>application</i> level <code>PerlIO *</code> is a pointer to a <code>PerlIOl *</code> - i.e. a pointer to a pointer to the struct. This allows the application level <code>PerlIO *</code> to remain constant while the actual <code>PerlIOl *</code> underneath changes. (Compare perl's <code>SV *</code> which remains constant while its <code>sv_any</code> field changes as the scalar's type changes.) An IO stream is then in general represented as a pointer to this linked-list of "layers".</p> <p>It should be noted that because of the double indirection in a <code>PerlIO *</code>, a <code>&amp;(perlio-&gt;next)</code> "is" a <code>PerlIO *</code>, and so to some degree at least one layer can use the "standard" API on the next layer down.</p> <p>A "layer" is composed of two parts:</p> <ol> <li>
<p>The functions and attributes of the "layer class".</p> </li> <li>
<p>The per-instance data for a particular handle.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id="Functions-and-Attributes">
Functions and Attributes</h3> <p>The functions and attributes are accessed via the "tab" (for table) member of <code>PerlIOl</code>. The functions (methods of the layer "class") are fixed, and are defined by the <code>PerlIO_funcs</code> type. They are broadly the same as the public <code>PerlIO_xxxxx</code> functions:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>struct _PerlIO_funcs

};</code></pre> <p>The first few members of the struct give a function table size for compatibility check "name" for the layer, the size to <code>malloc</code> for the per-instance data, and some flags which are attributes of the class as whole (such as whether it is a buffering layer), then follow the functions which fall into four basic groups:</p> <ol> <li>
<p>Opening and setup functions</p> </li> <li>
<p>Basic IO operations</p> </li> <li>
<p>Stdio class buffering options.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Functions to support Perl's traditional "fast" access to the buffer.</p> </li> </ol> <p>A layer does not have to implement all the functions, but the whole table has to be present. Unimplemented slots can be NULL (which will result in an error when called) or can be filled in with stubs to "inherit" behaviour from a "base class". This "inheritance" is fixed for all instances of the layer, but as the layer chooses which stubs to populate the table, limited "multiple inheritance" is possible.</p> <h3 id="Per-instance-Data">
Per-instance Data</h3> <p>The per-instance data are held in memory beyond the basic PerlIOl struct, by making a PerlIOl the first member of the layer's struct thus:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>typedef struct
{
 struct _PerlIO base;       /* Base "class" info */
 STDCHAR *	buf;        /* Start of buffer */
 STDCHAR *	end;        /* End of valid part of buffer */
 STDCHAR *	ptr;        /* Current position in buffer */
 Off_t		posn;       /* Offset of buf into the file */
 Size_t		bufsiz;     /* Real size of buffer */
 IV		oneword;    /* Emergency buffer */
} PerlIOBuf;</code></pre> <p>In this way (as for perl's scalars) a pointer to a PerlIOBuf can be treated as a pointer to a PerlIOl.</p> <h3 id="Layers-in-action.">

         |           |    +----------+</code></pre> <p>The above attempts to show how the layer scheme works in a simple case. The application's <code>PerlIO *</code> points to an entry in the table(s) representing open (allocated) handles. For example the first three slots in the table correspond to <code>stdin</code>,<code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>. The table in turn points to the current "top" layer for the handle - in this case an instance of the generic buffering layer "perlio". That layer in turn points to the next layer down - in this case the low-level "unix" layer.</p> <p>The above is roughly equivalent to a "stdio" buffered stream, but with much more flexibility:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>If Unix level <code>read</code>/<code>write</code>/<code>lseek</code> is not appropriate for (say) sockets then the "unix" layer can be replaced (at open time or even dynamically) with a "socket" layer.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Different handles can have different buffering schemes. The "top" layer could be the "mmap" layer if reading disk files was quicker using <code>mmap</code> than <code>read</code>. An "unbuffered" stream can be implemented simply by not having a buffer layer.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Extra layers can be inserted to process the data as it flows through. This was the driving need for including the scheme in perl 5.7.0+ - we needed a mechanism to allow data to be translated between perl's internal encoding (conceptually at least Unicode as UTF-8), and the "native" format used by the system. This is provided by the ":encoding(xxxx)" layer which typically sits above the buffering layer.</p> </li> <li>
<p>A layer can be added that does "\n" to CRLF translation. This layer can be used on any platform, not just those that normally do such things.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Per-instance-flag-bits">

The <i>layers</i> is an array of all the layers destined for the <code>PerlIO *</code>, and any arguments passed to them, <i>n</i> is the index into that array of the layer being called. The macro <code>PerlIOArg</code> will return a (possibly <code>NULL</code>) SV * for the argument passed to the layer.</p> <p>Where a layer opens or takes ownership of a file descriptor, that layer is responsible for getting the file descriptor's close-on-exec flag into the correct state.

Core Layers</h3> <p>The file <code>perlio.c</code> provides the following layers:</p> <dl> <dt id='"unix"'>
"unix"</dt> <dd> <p>A basic non-buffered layer which calls Unix/POSIX <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, <code>lseek()</code>, <code>close()</code>. No buffering. Even on platforms that distinguish between O_TEXT and O_BINARY this layer is always O_BINARY.</p> </dd> <dt id='"perlio"'>
"perlio"</dt> <dd> <p>A very complete generic buffering layer which provides the whole of PerlIO API. It is also intended to be used as a "base class" for other layers. (For example its <code>Read()</code> method is implemented in terms of the <code>Get_cnt()</code>/<code>Get_ptr()</code>/<code>Set_ptrcnt()</code> methods).</p> <p>"perlio" over "unix" provides a complete replacement for stdio as seen via PerlIO API. This is the default for USE_PERLIO when system's stdio does not permit perl's "fast gets" access, and which do not distinguish between <code>O_TEXT</code> and <code>O_BINARY</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id='"stdio"'>
"stdio"</dt> <dd> <p>A layer which provides the PerlIO API via the layer scheme, but implements it by calling system's stdio. This is (currently) the default if system's stdio provides sufficient access to allow perl's "fast gets" access and which do not distinguish between <code>O_TEXT</code> and <code>O_BINARY</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id='"crlf"'>
"crlf"</dt> <dd> <p>A layer derived using "perlio" as a base class. It provides Win32-like "\n" to CR,LF translation. Can either be applied above "perlio" or serve as the buffer layer itself. "crlf" over "unix" is the default if system distinguishes between <code>O_TEXT</code> and <code>O_BINARY</code> opens. (At some point "unix" will be replaced by a "native" Win32 IO layer on that platform, as Win32's read/write layer has various drawbacks.) The "crlf" layer is a reasonable model for a layer which transforms data in some way.</p> </dd> <dt id='"mmap"'>
"mmap"</dt> <dd> <p>If Configure detects <code>mmap()</code> functions this layer is provided (with "perlio" as a "base") which does "read" operations by mmap()ing the file. Performance improvement is marginal on modern systems, so it is mainly there as a proof of concept. It is likely to be unbundled from the core at some point. The "mmap" layer is a reasonable model for a minimalist "derived" layer.</p> </dd> <dt id='"pending"'>
"pending"</dt> <dd> <p>An "internal" derivative of "perlio" which can be used to provide Unread() function for layers which have no buffer or cannot be bothered. (Basically this layer's <code>Fill()</code> pops itself off the stack and so resumes reading from layer below.)</p> </dd> <dt id='"raw"'>
"raw"</dt> <dd> <p>A dummy layer which never exists on the layer stack. Instead when "pushed" it actually pops the stack removing itself, it then calls Binmode function table entry on all the layers in the stack - normally this (via PerlIOBase_binmode) removes any layers which do not have <code>PERLIO_K_RAW</code> bit set. Layers can modify that behaviour by defining their own Binmode entry.</p> </dd> <dt id='"utf8"'>
"utf8"</dt> <dd> <p>Another dummy layer. When pushed it pops itself and sets the <code>PERLIO_F_UTF8</code> flag on the layer which was (and now is once more) the top of the stack.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>In addition <i>perlio.c</i> also provides a number of <code>PerlIOBase_xxxx()</code> functions which are intended to be used in the table slots of classes which do not need to do anything special for a particular method.</p> <h3 id="Extension-Layers">
Extension Layers</h3> <p>Layers can be made available by extension modules. When an unknown layer is encountered the PerlIO code will perform the equivalent of :</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use PerlIO 'layer';</code></pre> <p>Where <i>layer</i> is the unknown layer. <i>PerlIO.pm</i> will then attempt to:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>require PerlIO::layer;</code></pre> <p>If after that process the layer is still not defined then the <code>open</code> will fail.</p> <p>The following extension layers are bundled with perl:</p> <dl> <dt id='":encoding"'>
":encoding"</dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Encoding;</code></pre> <p>makes this layer available, although <i>PerlIO.pm</i> "knows" where to find it. It is an example of a layer which takes an argument as it is called thus:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open( $fh, "&lt;:encoding(iso-8859-7)", $pathname );</code></pre> </dd> <dt id='":scalar"'>
":scalar"</dt> <dd> <p>Provides support for reading data from and writing data to a scalar.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open( $fh, "+&lt;:scalar", \$scalar );</code></pre> <p>When a handle is so opened, then reads get bytes from the string value of <i>$scalar</i>, and writes change the value. In both cases the position in <i>$scalar</i> starts as zero but can be altered via <code>seek</code>, and determined via <code>tell</code>.</p> <p>Please note that this layer is implied when calling open() thus:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open( $fh, "+&lt;", \$scalar );</code></pre> </dd> <dt id='":via"'>
":via"</dt> <dd> <p>Provided to allow layers to be implemented as Perl code. For instance:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use PerlIO::via::StripHTML;
open( my $fh, "&lt;:via(StripHTML)", "index.html" );</code></pre> <p>See <a href="PerlIO::via.html">PerlIO::via</a> for details.</p> </dd> </dl> <h2 id="TODO">TODO</h2> <p>Things that need to be done to improve this document.</p> <ul> <li>
<p>Explain how to make a valid fh without going through open()(i.e. apply a layer). For example if the file is not opened through perl, but we want to get back a fh, like it was opened by Perl.</p> <p>How PerlIO_apply_layera fits in, where its docs, was it made public?</p> <p>Currently the example could be something like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>PerlIO *foo_to_PerlIO(pTHX_ char *mode, ...)
{
    char *mode; /* "w", "r", etc */
    const char *layers = ":APR"; /* the layer name */
    PerlIO *f = PerlIO_allocate(aTHX);
    if (!f) {
        return NULL;
    }

    PerlIO_apply_layers(aTHX_ f, mode, layers);

    if (f) {
        PerlIOAPR *st = PerlIOSelf(f, PerlIOAPR);
        /* fill in the st struct, as in _open() */
        st-&gt;file = file;
        PerlIOBase(f)-&gt;flags |= PERLIO_F_OPEN;

        return f;
    }
    return NULL;
}</code></pre> </li> <li>
<p>fix/add the documentation in places marked as XXX.</p> </li> <li>
<p>The handling of errors by the layer is not specified. e.g. when $! should be set explicitly, when the error handling should be just delegated to the top layer.</p> <p>Probably give some hints on using SETERRNO() or pointers to where they can be found.</p> </li> <li>
<p>I think it would help to give some concrete examples to make it easier to understand the API. Of course I agree that the API has to be concise, but since there is no second document that is more of a guide, I think that it'd make it easier to start with the doc which is an API, but has examples in it in places where things are unclear, to a person who is not a PerlIO guru (yet).</p> </li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
