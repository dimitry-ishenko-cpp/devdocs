It can be used after running:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">make install</code></pre> <p>(or your platform's equivalent procedure) to verify that <b>perl</b> and its libraries have been installed correctly. A correct installation is verified by output that looks like:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">ok 1
ok 2</code></pre> <p>etc.</p> <h2 id="OPTIONS">OPTIONS</h2> <dl> <dt id="-h-help">
<b>-h</b> help</dt> <dd> <p>Prints out a brief help message.</p> </dd> <dt id="-p-print-preface">
<b>-p</b> print preface</dt> <dd> <p>Gives a description of each test prior to performing it.</p> </dd> <dt id="-v-verbose">
<b>-v</b> verbose</dt> <dd> <p>Gives more detailed information about each test, after it has been performed. Note that any failed tests ought to print out some extra information whether or not -v is thrown.</p> </dd> </dl> <h2 id="DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</h2> <ul> <li>
<p>print "# Perl binary '$perlpath' does not appear executable.\n";</p> <p>Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly installed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p> </li> <li>
<p>print "# Perl version '$]' installed, expected $ivp_VERSION.\n";</p> <p>Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly installed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p> </li> <li>
<p>print "# Perl \@INC directory '$_' does not appear to exist.\n";</p> <p>Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not properly installed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p> </li> <li>
<p>print "# Needed module '$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n";</p> <p>One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not present in the installation. This is a serious error since it adversely affects perlivp's ability to function. You may be able to correct this by performing a proper perl installation.</p> </li> <li>
<p>print "# Required module '$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n";</p> <p>An attempt to <code>eval "require $module"</code> failed, even though the list of extensions indicated that it should succeed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p> </li> <li>
<p>print "# Unnecessary module 'bLuRfle' appears to be installed.\n";</p> <p>This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have in fact installed a bLuRfle.pm module or that the <code>eval " require \"$module_name.pm\"; "</code> test may give misleading results with your installation of perl. If yours is the latter case then please let the author know.</p> </li> <li>
<p>print "# file",+($#missing == 0) ? '' : 's'," missing from installation:\n";</p> <p>One or more files turned up missing according to a run of <code>ExtUtils::Installed -&gt; validate()</code> over your installation. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For further information on how to conduct a proper installation consult the INSTALL file that comes with the perl source and the README file for your platform.</p> <h2 id="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</h2> <p>Peter Prymmer</p><div class="_attribution">
