This is for them.</p> <h2 id="use-strict">
use strict</h2> <p>First of all, there's a few things you can do to make your life a lot more straightforward when it comes to debugging perl programs, without using the debugger at all. To demonstrate, here's a simple script, named "hello", with a problem:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

$var1 = 'Hello World'; # always wanted to do that :-)
$var2 = "$varl\n";

print $var2; 
exit;</code></pre> <p>While this compiles and runs happily, it probably won't do what's expected, namely it doesn't print "Hello World\n" at all; It will on the other hand do exactly what it was told to do, computers being a bit that way inclined. That is, it will print out a newline character, and you'll get what looks like a blank line. It looks like there's 2 variables when (because of the typo) there's really 3:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$var1 = 'Hello World';
$varl = undef;
$var2 = "\n";</code></pre> <p>To catch this kind of problem, we can force each variable to be declared before use by pulling in the strict module, by putting 'use strict;' after the first line of the script.</p> <p>Now when you run it, perl complains about the 3 undeclared variables and we get four error messages because one variable is referenced twice:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>Global symbol "$var1" requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 4.
Global symbol "$var2" requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 5.
Global symbol "$varl" requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 5.
Global symbol "$var2" requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 7.
Execution of ./hello aborted due to compilation errors.     </code></pre> <p>Luvverly! and to fix this we declare all variables explicitly and now our script looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;

my $var1 = 'Hello World';
my $varl = undef;
my $var2 = "$varl\n";

print $var2; 
exit;</code></pre> <p>We then do (always a good idea) a syntax check before we try to run it again:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">&gt; perl -c hello
hello syntax OK </code></pre> <p>And now when we run it, we get "\n" still, but at least we know why. Just getting this script to compile has exposed the '$varl' (with the letter 'l') variable, and simply changing $varl to $var1 solves the problem.</p> <h2 id="Looking-at-data-and-w-and-v">
Looking at data and -w and v</h2> <p>Ok, but how about when you want to really see your data, what's in that dynamic variable, just before using it?</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl 
use strict;

my $key = 'welcome';
my %data = (
	'this' =&gt; qw(that), 
	'tom' =&gt; qw(and jerry),
	'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
	'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
);
my @data = keys %data;

print "$data{$key}\n";
exit;                               </code></pre> <p>Looks OK, after it's been through the syntax check (perl -c scriptname), we run it and all we get is a blank line again! Hmmmm.</p> <p>One common debugging approach here, would be to liberally sprinkle a few print statements, to add a check just before we print out our data, and another just after:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "All OK\n" if grep($key, keys %data);
print "$data{$key}\n";
print "done: '$data{$key}'\n";</code></pre> <p>And try again:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">&gt; perl data
All OK     

done: ''</code></pre> <p>After much staring at the same piece of code and not seeing the wood for the trees for some time, we get a cup of coffee and try another approach. That is, we bring in the cavalry by giving perl the '<b>-d</b>' switch on the command line:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>&gt; perl -d data

main::(./data:4):     my $key = 'welcome';   </code></pre> <p>Now, what we've done here is to launch the built-in perl debugger on our script. It's stopped at the first line of executable code and is waiting for input.</p> <p>Before we go any further, you'll want to know how to quit the debugger: use just the letter '<b>q</b>', not the words 'quit' or 'exit':</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">DB&lt;1&gt; q
&gt;</code></pre> <p>That's it, you're back on home turf again.</p> <h2 id="help">help</h2> <p>Fire the debugger up again on your script and we'll look at the help menu. There's a couple of ways of calling help: a simple '<b>h</b>' will get the summary help list, '<b>|h</b>' (pipe-h) will pipe the help through your pager (which is (probably 'more' or 'less'), and finally, '<b>h h</b>' (h-space-h) will give you the entire help screen.

First of all let's view some code at our present position (the first line of code in this case), via '<b>v</b>':</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;4&gt; v

9               'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),

11:     my @data = keys %data;
12:     print "All OK\n" if grep($key, keys %data);
13:     print "$data{$key}\n";
14:     print "done: '$data{$key}'\n";
15:     exit;      </code></pre> <p>And if you wanted to list line 5 again, type 'l 5', (note the space):</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;4&gt; l 5
5:      my %data = (</code></pre> <p>In this case, there's not much to see, but of course normally there's pages of stuff to wade through, and 'l' can be very useful. To reset your view to the line we're about to execute, type a lone period '.':</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;5&gt; .
main::(./data_a:4):     my $key = 'welcome';  </code></pre> <p>The line shown is the one that is about to be executed <b>next</b>, it hasn't happened yet. So while we can print a variable with the letter '<b>p</b>', at this point all we'd get is an empty (undefined) value back. What we need to do is to step through the next executable statement with an '<b>s</b>':</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;6&gt; s

main::(./data_a:6):             'this' =&gt; qw(that),

main::(./data_a:9):             'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
main::(./data_a:10):    );   </code></pre> <p>Now we can have a look at that first ($key) variable:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;7&gt; p $key 
welcome </code></pre> <p>line 13 is where the action is, so let's continue down to there via the letter '<b>c</b>', which by the way, inserts a 'one-time-only' breakpoint at the given line or sub routine:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;8&gt; c 13
All OK
main::(./data_a:13):    print "$data{$key}\n";</code></pre> <p>We've gone past our check (where 'All OK' was printed) and have stopped just before the meat of our task. We could try to print out a couple of variables to see what is happening:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;9&gt; p $data{$key}</code></pre> <p>Not much in there, lets have a look at our hash:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;10&gt; p %data
Hello Worldziptomandwelcomejerrywelcomethisthat 

DB&lt;11&gt; p keys %data
Hello Worldtomwelcomejerrythis  </code></pre> <p>Well, this isn't very easy to read, and using the helpful manual (<b>h h</b>), the '<b>x</b>' command looks promising:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;12&gt; x %data
0  'Hello World'
1  'zip'
2  'tom'
3  'and'
4  'welcome'
5  undef
6  'jerry'
7  'welcome'
8  'this'
9  'that'     </code></pre> <p>That's not much help, a couple of welcomes in there, but no indication of which are keys, and which are values, it's just a listed array dump and, in this case, not particularly helpful. The trick here, is to use a <b>reference</b> to the data structure:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;13&gt; x \%data
0  HASH(0x8194bc4)
   'Hello World' =&gt; 'zip'
   'jerry' =&gt; 'welcome'
   'this' =&gt; 'that'
   'tom' =&gt; 'and'
   'welcome' =&gt; undef  </code></pre> <p>The reference is truly dumped and we can finally see what we're dealing with. Our quoting was perfectly valid but wrong for our purposes, with 'and jerry' being treated as 2 separate words rather than a phrase, thus throwing the evenly paired hash structure out of alignment.</p> <p>The '<b>-w</b>' switch would have told us about this, had we used it at the start, and saved us a lot of trouble:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">&gt; perl -w data
Odd number of elements in hash assignment at ./data line 5.    </code></pre> <p>We fix our quoting: 'tom' =&gt; q(and jerry), and run it again, this time we get our expected output:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">&gt; perl -w data
Hello World</code></pre> <p>While we're here, take a closer look at the '<b>x</b>' command, it's really useful and will merrily dump out nested references, complete objects, partial objects - just about whatever you throw at it:</p> <p>Let's make a quick object and x-plode it, first we'll start the debugger: it wants some form of input from STDIN, so we give it something non-committal, a zero:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">&gt; perl -de 0

f33.3</code></pre> <p>We can put another break point on any line beginning with a colon, we'll use line 17 as that's just as we come out of the subroutine, and we'd like to pause there later on:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">DB&lt;2&gt; b 17</code></pre> <p>There's no feedback from this, but you can see what breakpoints are set by using the list 'L' command:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>	DB&lt;3&gt; L
	temp:
 		17:            print "$out $deg\n";
   		break if (1)     </code></pre> <p>Note that to delete a breakpoint you use 'B'.</p> <p>Now we'll continue down into our subroutine, this time rather than by line number, we'll use the subroutine name, followed by the now familiar 'v':</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;3&gt; c f2c
main::f2c(temp:30):             my $f = shift;  

DB&lt;4&gt; v
24:     exit;
25
26      sub f2c {
27==&gt;           my $f = shift;
28:             my $c = 5 * $f - 32 / 9; 
29:             return $c;
30      }
31
32      sub c2f {
33:             my $c = shift;   </code></pre> <p>Note that if there was a subroutine call between us and line 29, and we wanted to <b>single-step</b> through it, we could use the '<b>s</b>' command, and to step over it we would use '<b>n</b>' which would execute the sub, but not descend into it for inspection. In this case though, we simply continue down to line 29:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;4&gt; c 29  
main::f2c(temp:29):             return $c;</code></pre> <p>And have a look at the return value:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;5&gt; p $c
162.944444444444</code></pre> <p>This is not the right answer at all, but the sum looks correct. I wonder if it's anything to do with operator precedence? We'll try a couple of other possibilities with our sum:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;6&gt; p (5 * $f - 32 / 9)
162.944444444444

DB&lt;7&gt; p 5 * $f - (32 / 9) 
162.944444444444

DB&lt;8&gt; p (5 * $f) - 32 / 9
162.944444444444

DB&lt;9&gt; p 5 * ($f - 32) / 9
0.722222222222221</code></pre> <p>:-) that's more like it! Ok, now we can set our return variable and we'll return out of the sub with an 'r':</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>DB&lt;10&gt; $c = 5 * ($f - 32) / 9

DB&lt;11&gt; r
scalar context return from main::f2c: 0.722222222222221</code></pre> <p>Looks good, let's just continue off the end of the script:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">	DB&lt;12&gt; c
	0.72 c 
	Debugged program terminated.  Use q to quit or R to restart,
  	use O inhibit_exit to avoid stopping after program termination,
  	h q, h R or h O to get additional info.   </code></pre> <p>A quick fix to the offending line (insert the missing parentheses) in the actual program and we're finished.</p> <h2 id="Placeholder-for-a,-w,-t,-T">

OUTPUT TIPS</h2> <p>To get all the output from your error log, and not miss any messages via helpful operating system buffering, insert a line like this, at the start of your script:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$|=1;	</code></pre> <p>To watch the tail of a dynamically growing logfile, (from the command line):</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>tail -f $error_log</code></pre> <p>Wrapping all die calls in a handler routine can be useful to see how, and from where, they're being called, <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a> has more information:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>BEGIN { $SIG{__DIE__} = sub { require Carp; Carp::confess(@_) } }</code></pre> <p>Various useful techniques for the redirection of STDOUT and STDERR filehandles are explained in <a href="perlopentut.html">perlopentut</a> and <a href="perlfaq8.html">perlfaq8</a>.</p> <h2 id="CGI">CGI</h2> <p>Just a quick hint here for all those CGI programmers who can't figure out how on earth to get past that 'waiting for input' prompt, when running their CGI script from the command-line, try something like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">&gt; perl -d my_cgi.pl -nodebug </code></pre> <p>Of course <a href="cgi.html">CGI</a> and <a href="perlfaq9.html">perlfaq9</a> will tell you more.</p> <h2 id="GUIs">GUIs</h2> <p>The command line interface is tightly integrated with an <b>emacs</b> extension and there's a <b>vi</b> interface too.</p> <p>You don't have to do this all on the command line, though, there are a few GUI options out there. The nice thing about these is you can wave a mouse over a variable and a dump of its data will appear in an appropriate window, or in a popup balloon, no more tiresome typing of 'x $varname' :-)</p> <p>In particular have a hunt around for the following:</p> <p><b>ptkdb</b> perlTK based wrapper for the built-in debugger</p> <p><b>ddd</b> data display debugger</p> <p><b>PerlDevKit</b> and <b>PerlBuilder</b> are NT specific</p> <p>NB. (more info on these and others would be appreciated).</p> <h2 id="SUMMARY">SUMMARY</h2> <p>We've seen how to encourage good coding practices with <b>use strict</b> and <b>-w</b>. We can run the perl debugger <b>perl -d scriptname</b> to inspect your data from within the perl debugger with the <b>p</b> and <b>x</b> commands. You can walk through your code, set breakpoints with <b>b</b> and step through that code with <b>s</b> or <b>n</b>, continue with <b>c</b> and return from a sub with <b>r</b>. Fairly intuitive stuff when you get down to it.</p> <p>There is of course lots more to find out about, this has just scratched the surface. The best way to learn more is to use perldoc to find out more about the language, to read the on-line help (<a href="perldebug.html">perldebug</a> is probably the next place to go), and of course, experiment.</p> <h2 id="SEE-ALSO">
