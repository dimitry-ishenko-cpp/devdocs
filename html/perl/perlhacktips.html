COMMON PROBLEMS</h2> <p>Perl source now permits some specific C99 features which we know are supported by all platforms, but mostly plays by ANSI C89 rules. You don't care about some particular platform having broken Perl? I hear there is still a strong demand for J2EE programmers.</p> <h3 id="Perl-environment-problems">
Perl environment problems</h3> <ul> <li>
<p>Not compiling with threading</p> <p>Compiling with threading (-Duseithreads) completely rewrites the function prototypes of Perl. You better try your changes with that. Related to this is the difference between "Perl_-less" and "Perl_-ly" APIs, for example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>Perl_sv_setiv(aTHX_ ...);
sv_setiv(...);</code></pre> <p>The first one explicitly passes in the context, which is needed for e.g. threaded builds. The second one does that implicitly; do not get them mixed. If you are not passing in a aTHX_, you will need to do a dTHX as the first thing in the function.</p> <p>See <a href="perlguts.html#How-multiple-interpreters-and-concurrency-are-supported">"How multiple interpreters and concurrency are supported" in perlguts</a> for further discussion about context.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Not compiling with -DDEBUGGING</p> <p>The DEBUGGING define exposes more code to the compiler, therefore more ways for things to go wrong. You should try it.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Introducing (non-read-only) globals</p> <p>Do not introduce any modifiable globals, truly global or file static. They are bad form and complicate multithreading and other forms of concurrency. The right way is to introduce them as new interpreter variables, see <i>intrpvar.h</i> (at the very end for binary compatibility).</p> <p>Introducing read-only (const) globals is okay, as long as you verify with e.g. <code>nm libperl.a|egrep -v ' [TURtr] '</code> (if your <code>nm</code> has BSD-style output) that the data you added really is read-only. (If it is, it shouldn't show up in the output of that command.)</p> <p>If you want to have static strings, make them constant:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>static const char etc[] = "...";</code></pre> <p>If you want to have arrays of constant strings, note carefully the right combination of <code>const</code>s:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>static const char * const yippee[] =
    {"hi", "ho", "silver"};</code></pre> </li> <li>
<p>Not exporting your new function</p> <p>Some platforms (Win32, AIX, VMS, OS/2, to name a few) require any function that is part of the public API (the shared Perl library) to be explicitly marked as exported. See the discussion about <i>embed.pl</i> in <a href="perlguts.html">perlguts</a>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Exporting your new function</p> <p>The new shiny result of either genuine new functionality or your arduous refactoring is now ready and correctly exported. So what could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Maybe simply that your function did not need to be exported in the first place. Perl has a long and not so glorious history of exporting functions that it should not have.</p> <p>If the function is used only inside one source code file, make it static. See the discussion about <i>embed.pl</i> in <a href="perlguts.html">perlguts</a>.</p> <p>If the function is used across several files, but intended only for Perl's internal use (and this should be the common case), do not export it to the public API. See the discussion about <i>embed.pl</i> in <a href="perlguts.html">perlguts</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="C99">C99</h3> <p>Starting from 5.35.5 we now permit some C99 features in the core C source. However, code in dual life extensions still needs to be C89 only, because it needs to compile against earlier version of Perl running on older platforms. Also note that our headers need to also be valid as C++, because XS extensions written in C++ need to include them, hence <i>member structure initialisers</i> can't be used in headers.</p> <p>C99 support is still far from complete on all platforms we currently support. As a baseline we can only assume C89 semantics with the specific C99 features described below, which we've verified work everywhere. It's fine to probe for additional C99 features and use them where available, providing there is also a fallback for compilers that don't support the feature. For example, we use C11 thread local storage when available, but fall back to POSIX thread specific APIs otherwise, and we use <code>char</code> for booleans if <code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> isn't available.</p> <p>Code can use (and rely on) the following C99 features being present</p> <ul> <li>
<p>mixed declarations and code</p> </li> <li>
<p>64 bit integer types</p> <p>For consistency with the existing source code, use the typedefs <code>I64</code> and <code>U64</code>, instead of using <code>long long</code> and <code>unsigned long long</code> directly.</p> </li> <li>
<p>variadic macros</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>void greet(char *file, unsigned int line, char *format, ...);
#define logged_greet(...) greet(__FILE__, __LINE__, __VA_ARGS__);</code></pre> <p>Note that <code>__VA_OPT__</code> is a gcc extension not yet in any published standard.</p> </li> <li>
<p>declarations in for loops</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>for (const char *p = message; *p; ++p) {
    putchar(*p);
}</code></pre> </li> <li>
<p>member structure initialisers</p> <p>But not in headers, as support was only added to C++ relatively recently.</p> <p>Hence this is fine in C and XS code, but not headers:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>struct message {
    char *action;
    char *target;
};

struct message mcguffin = {
    .target = "member structure initialisers",
    .action = "Built"
 };</code></pre> </li> <li>
<p>flexible array members</p> <p>This is standards conformant:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>struct greeting {
    unsigned int len;
    char message[];
};</code></pre> <p>However, the source code already uses the "unwarranted chumminess with the compiler" hack in many places:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>struct greeting {
    unsigned int len;
    char message[1];
};</code></pre> <p>Strictly it <b>is</b> undefined behaviour accessing beyond <code>message[0]</code>, but this has been a commonly used hack since K&amp;R times, and using it hasn't been a practical issue anywhere (in the perl source or any other common C code). Hence it's unclear what we would gain from actively changing to the C99 approach.</p> </li> <li>
<p><code>//</code> comments</p> <p>All compilers we tested support their use. Not all humans we tested support their use.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Code explicitly should not use any other C99 features. For example</p> <ul> <li>
<p>variable length arrays</p> <p>Not supported by <b>any</b> MSVC, and this is not going to change.</p> <p>Even "variable" length arrays where the variable is a constant expression are syntax errors under MSVC.</p> </li> <li>
<p>C99 types in <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code></p> <p>Use <code>PERL_INT_FAST8_T</code> etc as defined in <i>handy.h</i></p> </li> <li>
<p>C99 format strings in <code>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code></p> <p><code>snprintf</code> in the VMS libc only added support for <code>PRIdN</code> etc very recently, meaning that there are live supported installations without this, or formats such as <code>%zu</code>.</p> <p>(perl's <code>sv_catpvf</code> etc use parser code code in <code>sv.c</code>, which supports the <code>z</code> modifier, along with perl-specific formats such as <code>SVf</code>.)</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to use a C99 feature not listed above then you need to do one of</p> <ul> <li>
<p>Probe for it in <i>Configure</i>, set a variable in <i>config.sh</i>, and add fallback logic in the headers for platforms which don't have it.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Write test code and verify that it works on platforms we need to support, before relying on it unconditionally.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Likely you want to repeat the same plan as we used to get the current C99 feature set. See the message at https://markmail.org/thread/odr4fjrn72u2fkpz for the C99 probes we used before. Note that the two most "fussy" compilers appear to be MSVC and the vendor compiler on VMS. To date all the *nix compilers have been far more flexible in what they support.</p> <p>On *nix platforms, <i>Configure</i> attempts to set compiler flags appropriately. All vendor compilers that we tested defaulted to C99 (or C11) support. However, older versions of gcc default to C89, or permit <i>most</i> C99 (with warnings), but forbid <i>declarations in for loops</i> unless <code>-std=gnu99</code> is added. The alternative <code>-std=c99</code> <b>might</b> seem better, but using it on some platforms can prevent <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> declaring some prototypes being declared, which breaks the build. gcc's <code>-ansi</code> flag implies <code>-std=c89</code> so we can no longer set that, hence the Configure option <code>-gccansipedantic</code> now only adds <code>-pedantic</code>.</p> <p>The Perl core source code files (the ones at the top level of the source code distribution) are automatically compiled with as many as possible of the <code>-std=gnu99</code>, <code>-pedantic</code>, and a selection of <code>-W</code> flags (see cflags.SH). Files in <i>ext/</i> <i>dist/</i> <i>cpan/</i> etc are compiled with the same flags as the installed perl would use to compile XS extensions.</p> <p>Basically, it's safe to assume that <i>Configure</i> and <i>cflags.SH</i> have picked the best combination of flags for the version of gcc on the platform, and attempting to add more flags related to enforcing a C dialect will cause problems either locally, or on other systems that the code is shipped to.</p> <p>We believe that the C99 support in gcc 3.1 is good enough for us, but we don't have a 19 year old gcc handy to check this :-) If you have ancient vendor compilers that don't default to C99, the flags you might want to try are</p> <dl> <dt id="AIX">AIX</dt> <dd> <p><code>-qlanglvl=stdc99</code></p> </dd> <dt id="HP/UX">

Symbol Names and Namespace Pollution</h3> <h4 id="Choosing-legal-symbol-names">
Choosing legal symbol names</h4> <p>C reserves for its implementation any symbol whose name begins with an underscore followed immediately by either an uppercase letter <code>[A-Z]</code> or another underscore. C++ further reserves any symbol containing two consecutive underscores, and further reserves in the global name space any symbol beginning with an underscore, not just ones followed by a capital. We care about C++ because <code>hdr</code> files need to be compilable by it, and some people do all their development using a C++ compiler.</p> <p>The consequences of failing to do this are probably none. Unless you stumble on a name that the implementation uses, things will work. Indeed, the perl core has more than a few instances of using implementation-reserved symbols. (These are gradually being changed.) But your code might stop working any time that the implementation decides to use a name you already had chosen, potentially many years before.</p> <p>It's best then to:</p> <dl> <dt id="Don't-begin-a-symbol-name-with-an-underscore;-(e.g.,-don't-use:-_FOOBAR)">
<b>Don't begin a symbol name with an underscore</b>; (<i>e.g.</i>, don't use: <code>_FOOBAR</code>)</dt>  <dt id="Don't-use-two-consecutive-underscores-in-a-symbol-name;-(e.g.,-don't-use-FOO__BAR)">
<b>Don't use two consecutive underscores in a symbol name</b>; (<i>e.g.</i>, don't use <code>FOO__BAR</code>)</dt>  </dl> <p>POSIX also reserves many symbols. See Section 2.2.2 in <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html</a>. Perl also has conflicts with that.</p> <p>Perl reserves for its use any symbol beginning with <code>Perl</code>, <code>perl</code>, or <code>PL_</code>. Any time you introduce a macro into a <code>hdr</code> file that doesn't follow that convention, you are creating the possiblity of a namespace clash with an existing XS module, unless you restrict it by, say,</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">#ifdef PERL_CORE
#  define my_symbol
#endif</code></pre> <p>There are many symbols in <code>hdr</code> files that aren't of this form, and which are accessible from XS namespace, intentionally or not, just about anything in <i>config.h</i>, for example.</p> <p>Having to use one of these prefixes detracts from the readability of the code, and hasn't been an actual issue for non-trivial names. Things like perl defining its own <code>MAX</code> macro have been problematic, but they were quickly discovered, and a <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>#ifdef PERL_CORE</code></span> guard added.</p> <p>So there's no rule imposed about using such symbols, just be aware of the issues.</p> <h4 id="Choosing-good-symbol-names">
Choosing good symbol names</h4> <p>Ideally, a symbol name name should correctly and precisely describe its intended purpose. But there is a tension between that and getting names that are overly long and hence awkward to type and read. Metaphors could be helpful (a poetic name), but those tend to be culturally specific, and may not translate for someone whose native language isn't English, or even comes from a different cultural background. Besides, the talent of writing poetry seems to be rare in programmers.</p> <p>Certain symbol names don't reflect their purpose, but are nonetheless fine to use because of long-standing conventions. These often originated in the field of Mathematics, where <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are frequently used as subscripts, and <code>n</code> as a population count. Since at least the 1950's, computer programs have used <code>i</code>, <i>etc.</i> as loop variables.</p> <p>Our guidance is to choose a name that reasonably describes the purpose, and to comment its declaration more precisely.</p> <p>One certainly shouldn't use misleading nor ambiguous names. <code>last_foo</code> could mean either the final <code>foo</code> or the previous <code>foo</code>, and so could be confusing to the reader, or even to the writer coming back to the code after a few months of working on something else. Sometimes the programmer has a particular line of thought in mind, and it doesn't occur to them that ambiguity is present.</p> <p>There are probably still many off-by-1 bugs around because the name <a href="perlapi.html#av_len">"<code>av_len</code>" in perlapi</a> doesn't correspond to what other <i>-len</i> constructs mean, such as <a href="perlapi.html#sv_len">"<code>sv_len</code>" in perlapi</a>. Awkward (and controversial) synonyms were created to use instead that conveyed its true meaning (<a href="perlapi.html#av_top_index">"<code>av_top_index</code>" in perlapi</a>). Eventually, though someone had the better idea to create a new name to signify what most people think <code>-len</code> signifies. So <a href="perlapi.html#av_count">"<code>av_count</code>" in perlapi</a> was born. And we wish it had been thought up much earlier.</p> <h3 id="Writing-safer-macros">
Writing safer macros</h3> <p>Macros are used extensively in the Perl core for such things as hiding internal details from the caller, so that it doesn't have to be concerned about them. For example, most lines of code don't need to know if they are running on a threaded versus unthreaded perl. That detail is automatically mostly hidden.</p> <p>It is often better to use an inline function instead of a macro. They are immune to name collisions with the caller, and don't magnify problems when called with parameters that are expressions with side effects. There was a time when one might choose a macro over an inline function because compiler support for inline functions was quite limited. Some only would actually only inline the first two or three encountered in a compilation. But those days are long gone, and inline functions are fully supported in modern compilers.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are situations where a function won't do, and a macro is required. One example is when a parameter can be any of several types. A function has to be declared with a single explicit</p> <p>Or maybe the code involved is so trivial that a function would be just complicating overkill, such as when the macro simply creates a mnemonic name for some constant value.</p> <p>If you do choose to use a non-trivial macro, be aware that there are several avoidable pitfalls that can occur. Keep in mind that a macro is expanded within the lexical context of each place in the source it is called. If you have a token <code>foo</code> in the macro and the source happens also to have <code>foo</code>, the meaning of the macro's <code>foo</code> will become that of the caller's. Sometimes that is exactly the behavior you want, but be aware that this tends to be confusing later on. It effectively turns <code>foo</code> into a reserved word for any code that calls the macro, and this fact is usually not documented nor considered. It is safer to pass <code>foo</code> as a parameter, so that <code>foo</code> remains freely available to the caller and the macro interface is explicitly specified.</p> <p>Worse is when the equivalence between the two <code>foo</code>'s is coincidental. Suppose for example, that the macro declares a variable</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">int foo</code></pre> <p>That works fine as long as the caller doesn't define the string <code>foo</code> in some way. And it might not be until years later that someone comes along with an instance where <code>foo</code> is used. For example a future caller could do this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">#define foo  bar</code></pre> <p>Then that declaration of <code>foo</code> in the macro suddenly becomes</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">int bar</code></pre> <p>That could mean that something completely different happens than intended. It is hard to debug; the macro and call may not even be in the same file, so it would require some digging and gnashing of teeth to figure out.</p> <p>Therefore, if a macro does use variables, their names should be such that it is very unlikely that they would collide with any caller, now or forever. One way to do that, now being used in the perl source, is to include the name of the macro itself as part of the name of each variable in the macro. Suppose the macro is named <code>SvPV</code> Then we could have</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>int foo_svpv_ = 0;</code></pre> <p>This is harder to read than plain <code>foo</code>, but it is pretty much guaranteed that a caller will never naively use <code>foo_svpv_</code> (and run into problems). (The lowercasing makes it clearer that this is a variable, but assumes that there won't be two elements whose names differ only in the case of their letters.) The trailing underscore makes it even more unlikely to clash, as those, by convention, signify a private variable name. (See <a href="#Choosing-legal-symbol-names">"Choosing legal symbol names"</a> for restrictions on what names you can use.)</p> <p>This kind of name collision doesn't happen with the macro's formal parameters, so they don't need to have complicated names. But there are pitfalls when a a parameter is an expression, or has some Perl magic attached. When calling a function, C will evaluate the parameter once, and pass the result to the function. But when calling a macro, the parameter is copied as-is by the C preprocessor to each instance inside the macro. This means that when evaluating a parameter having side effects, the function and macro results differ. This is particularly fraught when a parameter has overload magic, say it is a tied variable that reads the next line in a file upon each evaluation. Having it read multiple lines per call is probably not what the caller intended. If a macro refers to a potentially overloadable parameter more than once, it should first make a copy and then use that copy the rest of the time. There are macros in the perl core that violate this, but are gradually being converted, usually by changing to use inline functions instead.</p> <p>Above we said "first make a copy". In a macro, that is easier said than done, because macros are normally expressions, and declarations aren't allowed in expressions. But the <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>STMT_START</code> .. <code>STMT_END</code></span> construct, described in <a href="perlapi.html#STMT_START">perlapi</a>, allows you to have declarations in most contexts, as long as you don't need a return value. If you do need a value returned, you can make the interface such that a pointer is passed to the construct, which then stores its result there. (Or you can use GCC brace groups. But these require a fallback if the code will ever get executed on a platform that lacks this non-standard extension to C. And that fallback would be another code path, which can get out-of-sync with the brace group one, so doing this isn't advisable.) In situations where there's no other way, Perl does furnish <a href="perlintern.html#PL_Sv">"<code>PL_Sv</code>" in perlintern</a> and <a href="perlapi.html#PL_na">"<code>PL_na</code>" in perlapi</a> to use (with a slight performance penalty) for some such common cases. But beware that a call chain involving multiple macros using them will zap the other's use. These have been very difficult to debug.</p> <p>For a concrete example of these pitfalls in action, see <a href="https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=11144355">https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=11144355</a></p> <h3 id="Portability-problems">
Portability problems</h3> <p>The following are common causes of compilation and/or execution failures, not common to Perl as such. The C FAQ is good bedtime reading. Please test your changes with as many C compilers and platforms as possible; we will, anyway, and it's nice to save oneself from public embarrassment.</p> <p>Also study <a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> carefully to avoid any bad assumptions about the operating system, filesystems, character set, and so forth.</p> <p>Do not assume an operating system indicates a certain compiler.</p> <ul> <li>
<p>Casting pointers to integers or casting integers to pointers</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>void castaway(U8* p)
{
  IV i = p;</code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>void castaway(U8* p)
{
  IV i = (IV)p;</code></pre> <p>Both are bad, and broken, and unportable. Use the PTR2IV() macro that does it right. (Likewise, there are PTR2UV(), PTR2NV(), INT2PTR(), and NUM2PTR().)</p> </li> <li>
<p>Casting between function pointers and data pointers</p> <p>Technically speaking casting between function pointers and data pointers is unportable and undefined, but practically speaking it seems to work, but you should use the FPTR2DPTR() and DPTR2FPTR() macros. Sometimes you can also play games with unions.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Assuming sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)</p> <p>There are platforms where longs are 64 bits, and platforms where ints are 64 bits, and while we are out to shock you, even platforms where shorts are 64 bits. This is all legal according to the C standard. (In other words, "long long" is not a portable way to specify 64 bits, and "long long" is not even guaranteed to be any wider than "long".)</p> <p>Instead, use the definitions IV, UV, IVSIZE, I32SIZE, and so forth. Avoid things like I32 because they are <b>not</b> guaranteed to be <i>exactly</i> 32 bits, they are <i>at least</i> 32 bits, nor are they guaranteed to be <b>int</b> or <b>long</b>. If you explicitly need 64-bit variables, use I64 and U64.</p> </li> <li>

<p>Assuming the character set is ASCIIish</p> <p>Perl can compile and run under EBCDIC platforms. See <a href="perlebcdic.html">perlebcdic</a>. This is transparent for the most part, but because the character sets differ, you shouldn't use numeric (decimal, octal, nor hex) constants to refer to characters. You can safely say <code>'A'</code>, but not <code>0x41</code>. You can safely say <code>'\n'</code>, but not <code>\012</code>. However, you can use macros defined in <i>utf8.h</i> to specify any code point portably. <code>LATIN1_TO_NATIVE(0xDF)</code> is going to be the code point that means LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S on whatever platform you are running on (on ASCII platforms it compiles without adding any extra code, so there is zero performance hit on those). The acceptable inputs to <code>LATIN1_TO_NATIVE</code> are from <code>0x00</code> through <code>0xFF</code>. If your input isn't guaranteed to be in that range, use <code>UNICODE_TO_NATIVE</code> instead. <code>NATIVE_TO_LATIN1</code> and <code>NATIVE_TO_UNICODE</code> translate the opposite direction.</p> <p>If you need the string representation of a character that doesn't have a mnemonic name in C, you should add it to the list in <i>regen/unicode_constants.pl</i>, and have Perl create <code>#define</code>'s for you, based on the current platform.</p> <p>Note that the <code>is<i>FOO</i></code> and <code>to<i>FOO</i></code> macros in <i>handy.h</i> work properly on native code points and strings.</p> <p>Also, the range 'A' - 'Z' in ASCII is an unbroken sequence of 26 upper case alphabetic characters. That is not true in EBCDIC. Nor for 'a' to 'z'. But '0' - '9' is an unbroken range in both systems. Don't assume anything about other ranges. (Note that special handling of ranges in regular expression patterns and transliterations makes it appear to Perl code that the aforementioned ranges are all unbroken.)</p> <p>Many of the comments in the existing code ignore the possibility of EBCDIC, and may be wrong therefore, even if the code works. This is actually a tribute to the successful transparent insertion of being able to handle EBCDIC without having to change pre-existing code.</p> <p>UTF-8 and UTF-EBCDIC are two different encodings used to represent Unicode code points as sequences of bytes. Macros with the same names (but different definitions) in <i>utf8.h</i> and <i>utfebcdic.h</i> are used to allow the calling code to think that there is only one such encoding. This is almost always referred to as <code>utf8</code>, but it means the EBCDIC version as well. Again, comments in the code may well be wrong even if the code itself is right. For example, the concept of UTF-8 <code>invariant characters</code> differs between ASCII and EBCDIC. On ASCII platforms, only characters that do not have the high-order bit set (i.e. whose ordinals are strict ASCII, 0 - 127) are invariant, and the documentation and comments in the code may assume that, often referring to something like, say, <code>hibit</code>. The situation differs and is not so simple on EBCDIC machines, but as long as the code itself uses the <code>NATIVE_IS_INVARIANT()</code> macro appropriately, it works, even if the comments are wrong.</p> <p>As noted in <a href="perlhack.html#TESTING">"TESTING" in perlhack</a>, when writing test scripts, the file <i>t/charset_tools.pl</i> contains some helpful functions for writing tests valid on both ASCII and EBCDIC platforms. Sometimes, though, a test can't use a function and it's inconvenient to have different test versions depending on the platform. There are 20 code points that are the same in all 4 character sets currently recognized by Perl (the 3 EBCDIC code pages plus ISO 8859-1 (ASCII/Latin1)). These can be used in such tests, though there is a small possibility that Perl will become available in yet another character set, breaking your test. All but one of these code points are C0 control characters. The most significant controls that are the same are <code>\0</code>, <code>\r</code>, and <code>\N{VT}</code> (also specifiable as <code>\cK</code>, <code>\x0B</code>, <code>\N{U+0B}</code>, or <code>\013</code>). The single non-control is U+00B6 PILCROW SIGN. The controls that are the same have the same bit pattern in all 4 character sets, regardless of the UTF8ness of the string containing them. The bit pattern for U+B6 is the same in all 4 for non-UTF8 strings, but differs in each when its containing string is UTF-8 encoded. The only other code points that have some sort of sameness across all 4 character sets are the pair 0xDC and 0xFC. Together these represent upper- and lowercase LATIN LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS, but which is upper and which is lower may be reversed: 0xDC is the capital in Latin1 and 0xFC is the small letter, while 0xFC is the capital in EBCDIC and 0xDC is the small one. This factoid may be exploited in writing case insensitive tests that are the same across all 4 character sets.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Assuming the character set is just ASCII</p> <p>ASCII is a 7 bit encoding, but bytes have 8 bits in them. The 128 extra characters have different meanings depending on the locale. Absent a locale, currently these extra characters are generally considered to be unassigned, and this has presented some problems. This has being changed starting in 5.12 so that these characters can be considered to be Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1).</p> </li> <li>

One cause for people often making this mistake is that a "naked char" and therefore dereferencing a "naked char pointer" have an undefined signedness: it depends on the compiler and the flags of the compiler and the underlying platform whether the result is signed or unsigned. For this very same reason using a 'char' as an array index is bad.</p> </li> <li>

printf("who = %d\n", who);    /* BAD */</code></pre> <p>The problem here is that Uid_t might be not only not <code>int</code>-wide but it might also be unsigned, in which case large uids would be printed as negative values.</p> <p>There is no simple solution to this because of printf()'s limited intelligence, but for many types the right format is available as with either 'f' or '_f' suffix, for example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>IVdf /* IV in decimal */
UVxf /* UV is hexadecimal */

printf("i = %"IVdf"\n", i); /* The IVdf is a string constant. */

Uid_t_f /* Uid_t in decimal */

printf("who = %"Uid_t_f"\n", who);</code></pre> <p>Or you can try casting to a "wide enough" type:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>printf("i = %"IVdf"\n", (IV)something_very_small_and_signed);</code></pre> <p>See <a href="perlguts.html#Formatted-Printing-of-Size_t-and-SSize_t">"Formatted Printing of Size_t and SSize_t" in perlguts</a> for how to print those.</p> <p>Also remember that the <code>%p</code> format really does require a void pointer:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>U8* p = ...;

<p>Assuming the contents of static memory pointed to by the return values of Perl wrappers for C library functions doesn't change. Many C library functions return pointers to static storage that can be overwritten by subsequent calls to the same or related functions. Perl has wrappers for some of these functions. Originally many of those wrappers returned those volatile pointers. But over time almost all of them have evolved to return stable copies. To cope with the remaining ones, do a <a href="perlapi.html#savepv">"savepv" in perlapi</a> to make a copy, thus avoiding these problems. You will have to free the copy when you're done to avoid memory leaks. If you don't have control over when it gets freed, you'll need to make the copy in a mortal scalar, like so</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">SvPVX(sv_2mortal(newSVpv(volatile_string, 0)))</code></pre> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Problematic-System-Interfaces">
Problematic System Interfaces</h3> <ul> <li>
<p>Perl strings are NOT the same as C strings: They may contain <code>NUL</code> characters, whereas a C string is terminated by the first <code>NUL</code>. That is why Perl API functions that deal with strings generally take a pointer to the first byte and either a length or a pointer to the byte just beyond the final one.</p> <p>And this is the reason that many of the C library string handling functions should not be used. They don't cope with the full generality of Perl strings. It may be that your test cases don't have embedded <code>NUL</code>s, and so the tests pass, whereas there may well eventually arise real-world cases where they fail. A lesson here is to include <code>NUL</code>s in your tests. Now it's fairly rare in most real world cases to get <code>NUL</code>s, so your code may seem to work, until one day a <code>NUL</code> comes along.</p> <p>Here's an example. It used to be a common paradigm, for decades, in the perl core to use <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>strchr("list", c)</code></span> to see if the character <code>c</code> is any of the ones given in <code>"list"</code>, a double-quote-enclosed string of the set of characters that we are seeing if <code>c</code> is one of. As long as <code>c</code> isn't a <code>NUL</code>, it works. But when <code>c</code> is a <code>NUL</code>, <code>strchr</code> returns a pointer to the terminating <code>NUL</code> in <code>"list"</code>. This likely will result in a segfault or a security issue when the caller uses that end pointer as the starting point to read from.</p> <p>A solution to this and many similar issues is to use the <code>mem</code><i>-foo</i> C library functions instead. In this case <code>memchr</code> can be used to see if <code>c</code> is in <code>"list"</code> and works even if <code>c</code> is <code>NUL</code>. These functions need an additional parameter to give the string length. In the case of literal string parameters, perl has defined macros that calculate the length for you. See <a href="perlapi.html#String-Handling">"String Handling" in perlapi</a>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>malloc(0), realloc(0), calloc(0, 0) are non-portable. To be portable allocate at least one byte. (In general you should rarely need to work at this low level, but instead use the various malloc wrappers.)</p> </li> <li>
<p>snprintf() - the return type is unportable. Use my_snprintf() instead.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Security-problems">
Security problems</h3> <p>Last but not least, here are various tips for safer coding. See also <a href="perlclib.html">perlclib</a> for libc/stdio replacements one should use.</p> <ul> <li>
<p>Do not use gets()</p> <p>Or we will publicly ridicule you. Seriously.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Do not use tmpfile()</p> <p>Use mkstemp() instead.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Do not use strcpy() or strcat() or strncpy() or strncat()</p> <p>Use my_strlcpy() and my_strlcat() instead: they either use the native implementation, or Perl's own implementation (borrowed from the public domain implementation of INN).</p> </li> <li>
<p>Do not use sprintf() or vsprintf()</p> <p>If you really want just plain byte strings, use my_snprintf() and my_vsnprintf() instead, which will try to use snprintf() and vsnprintf() if those safer APIs are available. If you want something fancier than a plain byte string, use <a href="perlapi.html#form"><code>Perl_form</code>()</a> or SVs and <a href="perlapi.html#sv_catpvf"><code>Perl_sv_catpvf()</code></a>.</p> <p>Note that glibc <code>printf()</code>, <code>sprintf()</code>, etc. are buggy before glibc version 2.17. They won't allow a <code>%.s</code> format with a precision to create a string that isn't valid UTF-8 if the current underlying locale of the program is UTF-8. What happens is that the <code>%s</code> and its operand are simply skipped without any notice. <a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6530">https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6530</a>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Do not use atoi()</p> <p>Use grok_atoUV() instead. atoi() has ill-defined behavior on overflows, and cannot be used for incremental parsing. It is also affected by locale, which is bad.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Do not use strtol() or strtoul()</p> <p>Use grok_atoUV() instead. strtol() or strtoul() (or their IV/UV-friendly macro disguises, Strtol() and Strtoul(), or Atol() and Atoul() are affected by locale, which is bad.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="DEBUGGING">DEBUGGING</h2> <p>You can compile a special debugging version of Perl, which allows you to use the <code>-D</code> option of Perl to tell more about what Perl is doing. But sometimes there is no alternative than to dive in with a debugger, either to see the stack trace of a core dump (very useful in a bug report), or trying to figure out what went wrong before the core dump happened, or how did we end up having wrong or unexpected results.</p> <h3 id="Poking-at-Perl">

It will also turn on the <code>DEBUGGING</code> compilation symbol which enables all the internal debugging code in Perl. There are a whole bunch of things you can debug with this: <a href="perlrun.html#-Dletters">perlrun</a> lists them all, and the best way to find out about them is to play about with them.

SOURCE CODE STATIC ANALYSIS</h2> <p>Various tools exist for analysing C source code <b>statically</b>, as opposed to <b>dynamically</b>, that is, without executing the code. It is possible to detect resource leaks, undefined behaviour, type mismatches, portability problems, code paths that would cause illegal memory accesses, and other similar problems by just parsing the C code and looking at the resulting graph, what does it tell about the execution and data flows. As a matter of fact, this is exactly how C compilers know to give warnings about dubious code.</p> <h3 id="lint">lint</h3> <p>The good old C code quality inspector, <code>lint</code>, is available in several platforms, but please be aware that there are several different implementations of it by different vendors, which means that the flags are not identical across different platforms.</p> <p>There is a <code>lint</code> target in Makefile, but you may have to diddle with the flags (see above).</p> <h3 id="Coverity">Coverity</h3> <p>Coverity (<a href="http://www.coverity.com/">http://www.coverity.com/</a>) is a product similar to lint and as a testbed for their product they periodically check several open source projects, and they give out accounts to open source developers to the defect databases.</p> <p>There is Coverity setup for the perl5 project: <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/perl5">https://scan.coverity.com/projects/perl5</a></p> <h3 id="HP-UX-cadvise-(Code-Advisor)">

cpd (cut-and-paste detector)</h3> <p>The cpd tool detects cut-and-paste coding. If one instance of the cut-and-pasted code changes, all the other spots should probably be changed, too.

gcc warnings</h3> <p>Though much can be written about the inconsistency and coverage problems of gcc warnings (like <code>-Wall</code> not meaning "all the warnings", or some common portability problems not being covered by <code>-Wall</code>, or <code>-ansi</code> and <code>-pedantic</code> both being a poorly defined collection of warnings, and so forth), gcc is still a useful tool in keeping our coding nose clean.</p> <p>The <code>-Wall</code> is by default on.</p> <p>It would be nice for <code>-pedantic</code>) to be on always, but unfortunately it is not safe on all platforms - for example fatal conflicts with the system headers (Solaris being a prime example). If Configure <code>-Dgccansipedantic</code> is used, the <code>cflags</code> frontend selects <code>-pedantic</code> for the platforms where it is known to be safe.</p> <p>The following extra flags are added:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><code>-Wendif-labels</code></p> </li> <li>
<p><code>-Wextra</code></p> </li> <li>

<p><code>-Wshadow</code></p> </li> <li>
<p><code>-Wstrict-prototypes</code></p> </li> </ul> <p>The <code>-Wtraditional</code> is another example of the annoying tendency of gcc to bundle a lot of warnings under one switch (it would be impossible to deploy in practice because it would complain a lot) but it does contain some warnings that would be beneficial to have available on their own, such as the warning about string constants inside macros containing the macro arguments: this behaved differently pre-ANSI than it does in ANSI, and some C compilers are still in transition, AIX being an example.</p> <h3 id="Warnings-of-other-C-compilers">
Warnings of other C compilers</h3> <p>Other C compilers (yes, there <b>are</b> other C compilers than gcc) often have their "strict ANSI" or "strict ANSI with some portability extensions" modes on, like for example the Sun Workshop has its <code>-Xa</code> mode on (though implicitly), or the DEC (these days, HP...) has its <code>-std1</code> mode on.</p> <h2 id="MEMORY-DEBUGGERS">
MEMORY DEBUGGERS</h2> <p><b>NOTE 1</b>: Running under older memory debuggers such as Purify, valgrind or Third Degree greatly slows down the execution: seconds become minutes, minutes become hours. For example as of Perl 5.8.1, the ext/Encode/t/Unicode.t takes extraordinarily long to complete under e.g. Purify, Third Degree, and valgrind. Under valgrind it takes more than six hours, even on a snappy computer. The said test must be doing something that is quite unfriendly for memory debuggers. If you don't feel like waiting, that you can simply kill away the perl process. Roughly valgrind slows down execution by factor 10, AddressSanitizer by factor 2.</p> <p><b>NOTE 2</b>: To minimize the number of memory leak false alarms (see <a href="#PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL">"PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL"</a> for more information), you have to set the environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to 2. For example, like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 valgrind ./perl -Ilib ...</code></pre> <p><b>NOTE 3</b>: There are known memory leaks when there are compile-time errors within eval or require, seeing <code>S_doeval</code> in the call stack is a good sign of these. Fixing these leaks is non-trivial, unfortunately, but they must be fixed eventually.</p> <p><b>NOTE 4</b>: <a href="dynaloader.html">DynaLoader</a> will not clean up after itself completely unless Perl is built with the Configure option <code>-Accflags=-DDL_UNLOAD_ALL_AT_EXIT</code>.</p> <h3 id="valgrind">valgrind</h3> <p>The valgrind tool can be used to find out both memory leaks and illegal heap memory accesses. As of version 3.3.0, Valgrind only supports Linux on x86, x86-64 and PowerPC and Darwin (OS X) on x86 and x86-64. The special "test.valgrind" target can be used to run the tests under valgrind. Found errors and memory leaks are logged in files named <i>testfile.valgrind</i> and by default output is displayed inline.</p> <p>Example usage:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">make test.valgrind</code></pre> <p>Since valgrind adds significant overhead, tests will take much longer to run. The valgrind tests support being run in parallel to help with this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">TEST_JOBS=9 make test.valgrind</code></pre> <p>Note that the above two invocations will be very verbose as reachable memory and leak-checking is enabled by default. If you want to just see pure errors, try:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">VG_OPTS='-q --leak-check=no --show-reachable=no' TEST_JOBS=9 \
    make test.valgrind</code></pre> <p>Valgrind also provides a cachegrind tool, invoked on perl as:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">VG_OPTS=--tool=cachegrind make test.valgrind</code></pre> <p>As system libraries (most notably glibc) are also triggering errors, valgrind allows to suppress such errors using suppression files. The default suppression file that comes with valgrind already catches a lot of them. Some additional suppressions are defined in <i>t/perl.supp</i>.</p> <p>To get valgrind and for more information see</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">http://valgrind.org/</code></pre> <h3 id="AddressSanitizer">AddressSanitizer</h3> <p>AddressSanitizer ("ASan") consists of a compiler instrumentation module and a run-time <code>malloc</code> library. ASan is available for a variety of architectures, operating systems, and compilers (see project link below). It checks for unsafe memory usage, such as use after free and buffer overflow conditions, and is fast enough that you can easily compile your debugging or optimized perl with it. Modern versions of ASan check for memory leaks by default on most platforms, otherwise (e.g. x86_64 OS X) this feature can be enabled via <code>ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1</code>.</p> <p>To build perl with AddressSanitizer, your Configure invocation should look like:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">sh Configure -des -Dcc=clang \
   -Accflags=-fsanitize=address -Aldflags=-fsanitize=address \
   -Alddlflags=-shared\ -fsanitize=address \
   -fsanitize-blacklist=`pwd`/asan_ignore</code></pre> <p>where these arguments mean:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>-Dcc=clang</p> <p>This should be replaced by the full path to your clang executable if it is not in your path.</p> </li> <li>
<p>-Accflags=-fsanitize=address</p> <p>Compile perl and extensions sources with AddressSanitizer.</p> </li> <li>

You must manually specify <code>-shared</code> because using <code>-Alddlflags=-shared</code> will prevent Configure from setting a default value for <code>lddlflags</code>, which usually contains <code>-shared</code> (at least on Linux).</p> </li> <li>
<p>-fsanitize-blacklist=`pwd`/asan_ignore</p> <p>AddressSanitizer will ignore functions listed in the <code>asan_ignore</code> file. (This file should contain a short explanation of why each of the functions is listed.)</p> </li> </ul> <p>See also <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer</a>.</p> <h2 id="PROFILING">PROFILING</h2> <p>Depending on your platform there are various ways of profiling Perl.</p> <p>There are two commonly used techniques of profiling executables: <i>statistical time-sampling</i> and <i>basic-block counting</i>.</p> <p>The first method takes periodically samples of the CPU program counter, and since the program counter can be correlated with the code generated for functions, we get a statistical view of in which functions the program is spending its time. The caveats are that very small/fast functions have lower probability of showing up in the profile, and that periodically interrupting the program (this is usually done rather frequently, in the scale of milliseconds) imposes an additional overhead that may skew the results. The first problem can be alleviated by running the code for longer (in general this is a good idea for profiling), the second problem is usually kept in guard by the profiling tools themselves.</p> <p>The second method divides up the generated code into <i>basic blocks</i>. Basic blocks are sections of code that are entered only in the beginning and exited only at the end. For example, a conditional jump starts a basic block. Basic block profiling usually works by <i>instrumenting</i> the code by adding <i>enter basic block #nnnn</i> book-keeping code to the generated code. During the execution of the code the basic block counters are then updated appropriately. The caveat is that the added extra code can skew the results: again, the profiling tools usually try to factor their own effects out of the results.</p> <h3 id="Gprof-Profiling">
Gprof Profiling</h3> <p><i>gprof</i> is a profiling tool available in many Unix platforms which uses <i>statistical time-sampling</i>. You can build a profiled version of <i>perl</i> by compiling using gcc with the flag <code>-pg</code>. Either edit <i>config.sh</i> or re-run <i>Configure</i>. Running the profiled version of Perl will create an output file called <i>gmon.out</i> which contains the profiling data collected during the execution.</p> <p>quick hint:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">$ sh Configure -des -Dusedevel -Accflags='-pg' \

$ gprof ./perl &gt; out
$ less out</code></pre> <p>(you probably need to add <code>-shared</code> to the &lt;-Alddlflags&gt; line until RT #118199 is resolved)</p> <p>The <i>gprof</i> tool can then display the collected data in various ways. Usually <i>gprof</i> understands the following options:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>-a</p> <p>Suppress statically defined functions from the profile.</p> </li> <li>
<p>-b</p> <p>Suppress the verbose descriptions in the profile.</p> </li> <li>

<p>-f routine</p> <p>Display only the given routine and its descendants in the profile.</p> </li> <li>
<p>-s</p> <p>Generate a summary file called <i>gmon.sum</i> which then may be given to subsequent gprof runs to accumulate data over several runs.</p> </li> <li>

For each source file an accompanying <i>.gcda</i> file will be created.</p> <p>To display the results you use the <i>gcov</i> utility (which should be installed if you have gcc 3.0 or newer installed). <i>gcov</i> is run on source code files, like this</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">gcov sv.c</code></pre> <p>which will cause <i>sv.c.gcov</i> to be created. The <i>.gcov</i> files contain the source code annotated with relative frequencies of execution indicated by "#" markers. If you want to generate <i>.gcov</i> files for all profiled object files, you can run something like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>for file in `find . -name \*.gcno`
do sh -c "cd `dirname $file` &amp;&amp; gcov `basename $file .gcno`"
done</code></pre> <p>Useful options of <i>gcov</i> include <code>-b</code> which will summarise the basic block, branch, and function call coverage, and <code>-c</code> which instead of relative frequencies will use the actual counts. For more information on the use of <i>gcov</i> and basic block profiling with gcc, see the latest GNU CC manual.

callgrind profiling</h3> <p>callgrind is a valgrind tool for profiling source code. Paired with kcachegrind (a Qt based UI), it gives you an overview of where code is taking up time, as well as the ability to examine callers, call trees, and more. One of its benefits is you can use it on perl and XS modules that have not been compiled with debugging symbols.</p> <p>If perl is compiled with debugging symbols (<code>-g</code>), you can view the annotated source and click around, much like Devel::NYTProf's HTML output.</p> <p>For basic usage:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">valgrind --tool=callgrind ./perl ...</code></pre> <p>By default it will write output to <i>callgrind.out.PID</i>, but you can change that with <code>--callgrind-out-file=...</code></p> <p>To view the data, do:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">kcachegrind callgrind.out.PID</code></pre> <p>If you'd prefer to view the data in a terminal, you can use <i>callgrind_annotate</i>. In it's basic form:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">callgrind_annotate callgrind.out.PID | less</code></pre> <p>Some useful options are:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>--threshold</p> <p>Percentage of counts (of primary sort event) we are interested in. The default is 99%, 100% might show things that seem to be missing.</p> </li> <li>
<p>--auto</p> <p>Annotate all source files containing functions that helped reach the event count threshold.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="MISCELLANEOUS-TRICKS">
MISCELLANEOUS TRICKS</h2> <h3 id="PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL">PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</h3> <p>If you want to run any of the tests yourself manually using e.g. valgrind, please note that by default perl <b>does not</b> explicitly cleanup all the memory it has allocated (such as global memory arenas) but instead lets the exit() of the whole program "take care" of such allocations, also known as "global destruction of objects".</p> <p>There is a way to tell perl to do complete cleanup: set the environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to a non-zero value. The t/TEST wrapper does set this to 2, and this is what you need to do too, if you don't want to see the "global leaks": For example, for running under valgrind</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 valgrind ./perl -Ilib t/foo/bar.t</code></pre> <p>(Note: the mod_perl apache module uses also this environment variable for its own purposes and extended its semantics. Refer to the mod_perl documentation for more information. Also, spawned threads do the equivalent of setting this variable to the value 1.)</p> <p>If, at the end of a run you get the message <i>N scalars leaked</i>, you can recompile with <code>-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS</code>, (<code>Configure -Accflags=-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS</code>), which will cause the addresses of all those leaked SVs to be dumped along with details as to where each SV was originally allocated. This information is also displayed by Devel::Peek. Note that the extra details recorded with each SV increases memory usage, so it shouldn't be used in production environments. It also converts <code>new_SV()</code> from a macro into a real function, so you can use your favourite debugger to discover where those pesky SVs were allocated.</p> <p>If you see that you're leaking memory at runtime, but neither valgrind nor <code>-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS</code> will find anything, you're probably leaking SVs that are still reachable and will be properly cleaned up during destruction of the interpreter. In such cases, using the <code>-Dm</code> switch can point you to the source of the leak. If the executable was built with <code>-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS</code>, <code>-Dm</code> will output SV allocations in addition to memory allocations. Each SV allocation has a distinct serial number that will be written on creation and destruction of the SV. So if you're executing the leaking code in a loop, you need to look for SVs that are created, but never destroyed between each cycle. If such an SV is found, set a conditional breakpoint within <code>new_SV()</code> and make it break only when <code>PL_sv_serial</code> is equal to the serial number of the leaking SV. Then you will catch the interpreter in exactly the state where the leaking SV is allocated, which is sufficient in many cases to find the source of the leak.</p> <p>As <code>-Dm</code> is using the PerlIO layer for output, it will by itself allocate quite a bunch of SVs, which are hidden to avoid recursion. You can bypass the PerlIO layer if you use the SV logging provided by <code>-DPERL_MEM_LOG</code> instead.</p> <h3 id="PERL_MEM_LOG">PERL_MEM_LOG</h3> <p>If compiled with <code>-DPERL_MEM_LOG</code> (<code>-Accflags=-DPERL_MEM_LOG</code>), both memory and SV allocations go through logging functions, which is handy for breakpoint setting.</p> <p>Unless <code>-DPERL_MEM_LOG_NOIMPL</code> (<code>-Accflags=-DPERL_MEM_LOG_NOIMPL</code>) is also compiled, the logging functions read $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} to determine whether to log the event, and if so how:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /m/           Log all memory ops
$ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /s/           Log all SV ops
$ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /c/           Additionally log C backtrace for
                                    new_SV events
$ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /t/           include timestamp in Log
$ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /^(\d+)/      write to FD given (default is 2)</code></pre> <p>Memory logging is somewhat similar to <code>-Dm</code> but is independent of <code>-DDEBUGGING</code>, and at a higher level; all uses of Newx(), Renew(), and Safefree() are logged with the caller's source code file and line number (and C function name, if supported by the C compiler). In contrast, <code>-Dm</code> is directly at the point of <code>malloc()</code>. SV logging is similar.</p> <p>Since the logging doesn't use PerlIO, all SV allocations are logged and no extra SV allocations are introduced by enabling the logging. If compiled with <code>-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS</code>, the serial number for each SV allocation is also logged.</p> <p>The <code>c</code> option uses the <code>Perl_c_backtrace</code> facility, and therefore additionally requires the Configure <code>-Dusecbacktrace</code> compile flag in order to access it.</p> <h3 id="DDD-over-gdb">
DDD over gdb</h3> <p>Those debugging perl with the DDD frontend over gdb may find the following useful:</p> <p>You can extend the data conversion shortcuts menu, so for example you can display an SV's IV value with one click, without doing any typing. To do that simply edit ~/.ddd/init file and add after:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">! Display shortcuts.
Ddd*gdbDisplayShortcuts: \
/t ()   // Convert to Bin\n\
/d ()   // Convert to Dec\n\
/x ()   // Convert to Hex\n\
/o ()   // Convert to Oct(\n\</code></pre> <p>the following two lines:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>((XPV*) (())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xpv_pv  // 2pvx\n\
((XPVIV*) (())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xiv_iv // 2ivx</code></pre> <p>so now you can do ivx and pvx lookups or you can plug there the sv_peek "conversion":</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">Perl_sv_peek(my_perl, (SV*)()) // sv_peek</code></pre> <p>(The my_perl is for threaded builds.) Just remember that every line, but the last one, should end with \n\</p> <p>Alternatively edit the init file interactively via: 3rd mouse button -&gt; New Display -&gt; Edit Menu</p> <p>Note: you can define up to 20 conversion shortcuts in the gdb section.</p> <h3 id="C-backtrace">
C backtrace</h3> <p>On some platforms Perl supports retrieving the C level backtrace (similar to what symbolic debuggers like gdb do).</p> <p>The backtrace returns the stack trace of the C call frames, with the symbol names (function names), the object names (like "perl"), and if it can, also the source code locations (file:line).</p> <p>The supported platforms are Linux, and OS X (some *BSD might work at least partly, but they have not yet been tested).</p> <p>This feature hasn't been tested with multiple threads, but it will only show the backtrace of the thread doing the backtracing.</p> <p>The feature needs to be enabled with <code>Configure -Dusecbacktrace</code>.</p> <p>The <code>-Dusecbacktrace</code> also enables keeping the debug information when compiling/linking (often: <code>-g</code>). Many compilers/linkers do support having both optimization and keeping the debug information. The debug information is needed for the symbol names and the source locations.</p> <p>Static functions might not be visible for the backtrace.</p> <p>Source code locations, even if available, can often be missing or misleading if the compiler has e.g. inlined code. Optimizer can make matching the source code and the object code quite challenging.</p> <dl> <dt id="Linux">Linux</dt> <dd> <p>You <b>must</b> have the BFD (-lbfd) library installed, otherwise <code>perl</code> will fail to link. The BFD is usually distributed as part of the GNU binutils.</p> <p>Summary: <code>Configure ... -Dusecbacktrace</code> and you need <code>-lbfd</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id="OS-X">
OS X</dt> <dd> <p>The source code locations are supported <b>only</b> if you have the Developer Tools installed. (BFD is <b>not</b> needed.)</p> <p>Summary: <code>Configure ... -Dusecbacktrace</code> and installing the Developer Tools would be good.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>Optionally, for trying out the feature, you may want to enable automatic dumping of the backtrace just before a warning or croak (die) message is emitted, by adding <code>-Accflags=-DUSE_C_BACKTRACE_ON_ERROR</code> for Configure.</p> <p>Unless the above additional feature is enabled, nothing about the backtrace functionality is visible, except for the Perl/XS level.</p> <p>Furthermore, even if you have enabled this feature to be compiled, you need to enable it in runtime with an environment variable: <code>PERL_C_BACKTRACE_ON_ERROR=10</code>. It must be an integer higher than zero, telling the desired frame count.</p> <p>Retrieving the backtrace from Perl level (using for example an XS extension) would be much less exciting than one would hope: normally you would see <code>runops</code>, <code>entersub</code>, and not much else. This API is intended to be called <b>from within</b> the Perl implementation, not from Perl level execution.</p> <p>The C API for the backtrace is as follows:</p> <dl> <dt id="get_c_backtrace">get_c_backtrace</dt>  <dt id="free_c_backtrace">free_c_backtrace</dt>  <dt id="get_c_backtrace_dump">get_c_backtrace_dump</dt>  <dt id="dump_c_backtrace">dump_c_backtrace</dt>  </dl> <h3 id="Poison">Poison</h3> <p>If you see in a debugger a memory area mysteriously full of 0xABABABAB or 0xEFEFEFEF, you may be seeing the effect of the Poison() macros, see <a href="perlclib.html">perlclib</a>.</p> <h3 id="Read-only-optrees">
Read-only optrees</h3> <p>Under ithreads the optree is read only. If you want to enforce this, to check for write accesses from buggy code, compile with <code>-Accflags=-DPERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS</code> to enable code that allocates op memory via <code>mmap</code>, and sets it read-only when it is attached to a subroutine. Any write access to an op results in a <code>SIGBUS</code> and abort.</p> <p>This code is intended for development only, and may not be portable even to all Unix variants. Also, it is an 80% solution, in that it isn't able to make all ops read only. Specifically it does not apply to op slabs belonging to <code>BEGIN</code> blocks.</p> <p>However, as an 80% solution it is still effective, as it has caught bugs in the past.</p> <h3 id="When-is-a-bool-not-a-bool?">
When is a bool not a bool?</h3> <p>There wasn't necessarily a standard <code>bool</code> type on compilers prior to C99, and so some workarounds were created. The <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> macros are still available as alternatives for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. And the <code>cBOOL</code> macro was created to correctly cast to a true/false value in all circumstances, but should no longer be necessary. Using <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>(bool)</code> <i>expr</i></span>&gt; should now always work.</p> <p>There are no plans to remove any of <code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code>, nor <code>cBOOL</code>.</p> <h3 id="Finding-unsafe-truncations">
Finding unsafe truncations</h3> <p>You may wish to run <code>Configure</code> with something like</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">-Accflags='-Wconversion -Wno-sign-conversion -Wno-shorten-64-to-32'</code></pre> <p>or your compiler's equivalent to make it easier to spot any unsafe truncations that show up.</p> <h3 id="The-.i-Targets">
The .i Targets</h3> <p>You can expand the macros in a <i>foo.c</i> file by saying</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">make foo.i</code></pre> <p>which will expand the macros using cpp. Don't be scared by the results.</p> <h2 id="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</h2> <p>This document was originally written by Nathan Torkington, and is maintained by the perl5-porters mailing list.</p><div class="_attribution">
