For comparison, <code>print "Hello, world."</code> produced 96 lines of output from B::Debug, but only 6 from B::Terse.</p> <p>This module is useful for people who are writing their own back end, or who are learning about the Perl internals. It's not useful to the average programmer.</p> <p>This version of B::Terse is really just a wrapper that calls <a href="B::Concise.html">B::Concise</a> with the <b>-terse</b> option. It is provided for compatibility with old scripts (and habits) but using B::Concise directly is now recommended instead.</p> <p>For compatibility with the old B::Terse, this module also adds a method named <code>terse</code> to B::OP and B::SV objects. The B::SV method is largely compatible with the old one, though authors of new software might be advised to choose a more user-friendly output format. The B::OP <code>terse</code> method, however, doesn't work well. Since B::Terse was first written, much more information in OPs has migrated to the scratchpad datastructure, but the <code>terse</code> interface doesn't have any way of getting to the correct pad. As a kludge, the new version will always use the pad for the main program, but for OPs in subroutines this will give the wrong answer or crash.</p> <h2 id="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</h2> <p>The original version of B::Terse was written by Malcolm Beattie, &lt;mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk&gt;. This wrapper was written by Stephen McCamant, &lt;smcc@MIT.EDU&gt;.</p><div class="_attribution">
