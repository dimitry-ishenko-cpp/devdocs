The old "gnu-0.2" binary distribution will most certainly have additional problems.</p> <h3 id="Known-Problems-with-Perl-on-Hurd">
Known Problems with Perl on Hurd</h3> <p>The Perl test suite may still report some errors on the Hurd. The "lib/anydbm" and "pragma/warnings" tests will almost certainly fail. Both failures are not really specific to the Hurd, as indicated by the test suite output.</p> <p>The socket tests may fail if the network is not configured. You have to make "/hurd/pfinet" the translator for "/servers/socket/2", giving it the right arguments. Try "/hurd/pfinet --help" for more information.</p> <p>Here are the statistics for Perl 5.005_62 on my system:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">Failed Test  Status Wstat Total Fail  Failed  List of failed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
lib/anydbm.t                 12    1   8.33%  12
pragma/warnings             333    1   0.30%  215

8 tests and 24 subtests skipped.
Failed 2/229 test scripts, 99.13% okay. 2/10850 subtests failed,
    99.98% okay.</code></pre> <p>There are quite a few systems out there that do worse!</p> <p>However, since I am running a very recent Hurd snapshot, in which a lot of bugs that were exposed by the Perl test suite have been fixed, you may encounter more failures. Likely candidates are: "op/stat", "lib/io_pipe", "lib/io_sock", "lib/io_udp" and "lib/time".</p> <p>In any way, if you're seeing failures beyond those mentioned in this document, please consider upgrading to the latest Hurd before reporting the failure as a bug.</p> <h2 id="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</h2> <p>Mark Kettenis &lt;kettenis@gnu.org&gt;</p> <p>Last Updated: Fri, 29 Oct 1999 22:50:30 +0200</p><div class="_attribution">
