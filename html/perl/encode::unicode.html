Size, Endianness, and BOM</h2> <p>You can categorize these CES by 3 criteria: size of each character, endianness, and Byte Order Mark.</p> <h3 id="by-size">
by size</h3> <p>UCS-2 is a fixed-length encoding with each character taking 16 bits. It <b>does not</b> support <i>surrogate pairs</i>. When a surrogate pair is encountered during decode(), its place is filled with \x{FFFD} if <i>CHECK</i> is 0, or the routine croaks if <i>CHECK</i> is 1. When a character whose ord value is larger than 0xFFFF is encountered, its place is filled with \x{FFFD} if <i>CHECK</i> is 0, or the routine croaks if <i>CHECK</i> is 1.</p> <p>UTF-16 is almost the same as UCS-2 but it supports <i>surrogate pairs</i>. When it encounters a high surrogate (0xD800-0xDBFF), it fetches the following low surrogate (0xDC00-0xDFFF) and <code>desurrogate</code>s them to form a character. Bogus surrogates result in death. When \x{10000} or above is encountered during encode(), it <code>ensurrogate</code>s them and pushes the surrogate pair to the output stream.</p> <p>UTF-32 (UCS-4) is a fixed-length encoding with each character taking 32 bits. Since it is 32-bit, there is no need for <i>surrogate pairs</i>.</p> <h3 id="by-endianness">
by endianness</h3> <p>The first (and now failed) goal of Unicode was to map all character repertoires into a fixed-length integer so that programmers are happy. Since each character is either a <i>short</i> or <i>long</i> in C, you have to pay attention to the endianness of each platform when you pass data to one another.</p> <p>Anything marked as BE is Big Endian (or network byte order) and LE is Little Endian (aka VAX byte order). For anything not marked either BE or LE, a character called Byte Order Mark (BOM) indicating the endianness is prepended to the string.</p> <p>CAVEAT: Though BOM in utf8 (\xEF\xBB\xBF) is valid, it is meaningless and as of this writing Encode suite just leave it as is (\x{FeFF}).</p> <dl> <dt id="BOM-as-integer-when-fetched-in-network-byte-order">
BOM as integer when fetched in network byte order</dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">            16         32 bits/char
-------------------------
BE      0xFeFF 0x0000FeFF
LE      0xFFFe 0xFFFe0000
-------------------------</code></pre> </dd> </dl> <p>This modules handles the BOM as follows.</p> <ul> <li>
<p>When BE or LE is explicitly stated as the name of encoding, BOM is simply treated as a normal character (ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE).</p> </li> <li>
<p>When BE or LE is omitted during decode(), it checks if BOM is at the beginning of the string; if one is found, the endianness is set to what the BOM says.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Default Byte Order</p> <p>When no BOM is found, Encode 2.76 and blow croaked. Since Encode 2.77, it falls back to BE accordingly to RFC2781 and the Unicode Standard version 8.0</p> </li> <li>
<p>When BE or LE is omitted during encode(), it returns a BE-encoded string with BOM prepended. So when you want to encode a whole text file, make sure you encode() the whole text at once, not line by line or each line, not file, will have a BOM prepended.</p> </li> <li>
<p><code>UCS-2</code> is an exception. Unlike others, this is an alias of UCS-2BE. UCS-2 is already registered by IANA and others that way.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="Surrogate-Pairs">
Surrogate Pairs</h2> <p>To say the least, surrogate pairs were the biggest mistake of the Unicode Consortium. But according to the late Douglas Adams in <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> Trilogy, <code>In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move</code>. Their mistake was not of this magnitude so let's forgive them.</p> <p>(I don't dare make any comparison with Unicode Consortium and the Vogons here ;) Or, comparing Encode to Babel Fish is completely appropriate -- if you can only stick this into your ear :)</p> <p>Surrogate pairs were born when the Unicode Consortium finally admitted that 16 bits were not big enough to hold all the world's character repertoires. But they already made UCS-2 16-bit. What do we do?</p> <p>Back then, the range 0xD800-0xDFFF was not allocated. Let's split that range in half and use the first half to represent the <code>upper half of a character</code> and the second half to represent the <code>lower half of a character</code>. That way, you can represent 1024 * 1024 = 1048576 more characters. Now we can store character ranges up to \x{10ffff} even with 16-bit encodings. This pair of half-character is now called a <i>surrogate pair</i> and UTF-16 is the name of the encoding that embraces them.</p> <p>Here is a formula to ensurrogate a Unicode character \x{10000} and above;</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$hi = ($uni - 0x10000) / 0x400 + 0xD800;
$lo = ($uni - 0x10000) % 0x400 + 0xDC00;</code></pre> <p>And to desurrogate;</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$uni = 0x10000 + ($hi - 0xD800) * 0x400 + ($lo - 0xDC00);</code></pre> <p>Note this move has made \x{D800}-\x{DFFF} into a forbidden zone but perl does not prohibit the use of characters within this range. To perl, every one of \x{0000_0000} up to \x{ffff_ffff} (*) is <i>a character</i>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">(*) or \x{ffff_ffff_ffff_ffff} if your perl is compiled with 64-bit
integer support!</code></pre> <h2 id="Error-Checking">
Error Checking</h2> <p>Unlike most encodings which accept various ways to handle errors, Unicode encodings simply croaks.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>% perl -MEncode -e'$_ = "\xfe\xff\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\0\n"' \
       -e'Encode::from_to($_, "utf16","shift_jis", 0); print'
UTF-16:Malformed LO surrogate d8d9 at /path/to/Encode.pm line 184.
% perl -MEncode -e'$a = "BOM missing"' \
       -e' Encode::from_to($a, "utf16", "shift_jis", 0); print'
UTF-16:Unrecognised BOM 424f at /path/to/Encode.pm line 184.</code></pre> <p>Unlike other encodings where mappings are not one-to-one against Unicode, UTFs are supposed to map 100% against one another. So Encode is more strict on UTFs.</p> <p>Consider that "division by zero" of Encode :)</p> <h2 id="SEE-ALSO">
