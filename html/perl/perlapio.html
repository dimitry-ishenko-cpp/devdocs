The perl headers (in particular "perlio.h") will <code>#define</code> them to the I/O mechanism selected at Configure time.</p> <p>The functions are modeled on those in <i>stdio.h</i>, but parameter order has been "tidied up a little".</p> <p><code>PerlIO *</code> takes the place of FILE *. Like FILE * it should be treated as opaque (it is probably safe to assume it is a pointer to something).</p> <p>There are currently two implementations:</p> <dl> <dt id="1.-USE_STDIO">
1. USE_STDIO</dt> <dd> <p>All above are #define'd to stdio functions or are trivial wrapper functions which call stdio. In this case <i>only</i> PerlIO * is a FILE *. This has been the default implementation since the abstraction was introduced in perl5.003_02.</p> </dd> <dt id="2.-USE_PERLIO">
2. USE_PERLIO</dt> <dd> <p>Introduced just after perl5.7.0, this is a re-implementation of the above abstraction which allows perl more control over how IO is done as it decouples IO from the way the operating system and C library choose to do things. For USE_PERLIO PerlIO * has an extra layer of indirection - it is a pointer-to-a-pointer. This allows the PerlIO * to remain with a known value while swapping the implementation around underneath <i>at run time</i>. In this case all the above are true (but very simple) functions which call the underlying implementation.</p> <p>This is the only implementation for which <code>PerlIO_apply_layers()</code> does anything "interesting".</p> <p>The USE_PERLIO implementation is described in <a href="perliol.html">perliol</a>.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>Because "perlio.h" is a thin layer (for efficiency) the semantics of these functions are somewhat dependent on the underlying implementation. Where these variations are understood they are noted below.</p> <p>Unless otherwise noted, functions return 0 on success, or a negative value (usually <code>EOF</code> which is usually -1) and set <code>errno</code> on error.</p> <dl> <dt id="PerlIO_stdin(),-PerlIO_stdout(),-PerlIO_stderr()">
<b>PerlIO_stdin()</b>, <b>PerlIO_stdout()</b>, <b>PerlIO_stderr()</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>Use these rather than <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, <code>stderr</code>. They are written to look like "function calls" rather than variables because this makes it easier to <i>make them</i> function calls if platform cannot export data to loaded modules, or if (say) different "threads" might have different values.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_open(path,-mode),-PerlIO_fdopen(fd,mode)">
<b>PerlIO_open(path, mode)</b>, <b>PerlIO_fdopen(fd,mode)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>These correspond to fopen()/fdopen() and the arguments are the same. Return <code>NULL</code> and set <code>errno</code> if there is an error. There may be an implementation limit on the number of open handles, which may be lower than the limit on the number of open files - <code>errno</code> may not be set when <code>NULL</code> is returned if this limit is exceeded.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_reopen(path,mode,f)">
<b>PerlIO_reopen(path,mode,f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>While this currently exists in both implementations, perl itself does not use it. <i>As perl does not use it, it is not well tested.</i></p> <p>Perl prefers to <code>dup</code> the new low-level descriptor to the descriptor used by the existing PerlIO. This may become the behaviour of this function in the future.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_printf(f,fmt,...),-PerlIO_vprintf(f,fmt,a)">
<b>PerlIO_printf(f,fmt,...)</b>, <b>PerlIO_vprintf(f,fmt,a)</b>

<b>PerlIO_read(f,buf,count)</b>, <b>PerlIO_write(f,buf,count)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>These correspond functionally to fread() and fwrite() but the arguments and return values are different. The PerlIO_read() and PerlIO_write() signatures have been modeled on the more sane low level read() and write() functions instead: The "file" argument is passed first, there is only one "count", and the return value can distinguish between error and <code>EOF</code>.</p> <p>Returns a byte count if successful (which may be zero or positive), returns negative value and sets <code>errno</code> on error. Depending on implementation <code>errno</code> may be <code>EINTR</code> if operation was interrupted by a signal.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_fill(f)">
<b>PerlIO_fill(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>Fills the buffer associated with <code>f</code> with data from the layer below. <code>PerlIO_read</code> calls this as part of its normal operation. Returns 0 upon success; -1 on failure.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_close(f)">

</dt> <dd> <p>These correspond to fputs() and fputc(). Note that arguments have been revised to have "file" first.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_ungetc(f,c)">
<b>PerlIO_ungetc(f,c)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to ungetc(). Note that arguments have been revised to have "file" first. Arranges that next read operation will return the byte <b>c</b>. Despite the implied "character" in the name only values in the range 0..0xFF are defined. Returns the byte <b>c</b> on success or -1 (<code>EOF</code>) on error. The number of bytes that can be "pushed back" may vary, only 1 character is certain, and then only if it is the last character that was read from the handle.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_unread(f,buf,count)">
<b>PerlIO_unread(f,buf,count)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This allows one to unget more than a single byte. It effectively unshifts <code>count</code> bytes onto the beginning of the buffer <code>buf</code>, so that the next read operation(s) will return them before anything else that was in the buffer.</p> <p>Returns the number of unread bytes.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_getc(f)">
<b>PerlIO_getc(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to getc(). Despite the c in the name only byte range 0..0xFF is supported. Returns the character read or -1 (<code>EOF</code>) on error.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_eof(f)">
<b>PerlIO_eof(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to feof(). Returns a true/false indication of whether the handle is at end of file. For terminal devices this may or may not be "sticky" depending on the implementation. The flag is cleared by PerlIO_seek(), or PerlIO_rewind().</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_error(f)">
<b>PerlIO_error(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to ferror(). Returns a true/false indication of whether there has been an IO error on the handle.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_fileno(f)">
<b>PerlIO_fileno(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to fileno(), note that on some platforms, the meaning of "fileno" may not match Unix. Returns -1 if the handle has no open descriptor associated with it.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_clearerr(f)">
<b>PerlIO_clearerr(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to clearerr(), i.e., clears 'error' and (usually) 'eof' flags for the "stream". Does not return a value.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_flush(f)">
<b>PerlIO_flush(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to fflush(). Sends any buffered write data to the underlying file. If called with <code>NULL</code> this may flush all open streams (or core dump with some USE_STDIO implementations). Calling on a handle open for read only, or on which last operation was a read of some kind may lead to undefined behaviour on some USE_STDIO implementations. The USE_PERLIO (layers) implementation tries to behave better: it flushes all open streams when passed <code>NULL</code>, and attempts to retain data on read streams either in the buffer or by seeking the handle to the current logical position.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_seek(f,offset,whence)">
<b>PerlIO_seek(f,offset,whence)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to fseek(). Sends buffered write data to the underlying file, or discards any buffered read data, then positions the file descriptor as specified by <b>offset</b> and <b>whence</b> (sic). This is the correct thing to do when switching between read and write on the same handle (see issues with PerlIO_flush() above). Offset is of type <code>Off_t</code> which is a perl Configure value which may not be same as stdio's <code>off_t</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_tell(f)">
<b>PerlIO_tell(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to ftell(). Returns the current file position, or (Off_t) -1 on error. May just return value system "knows" without making a system call or checking the underlying file descriptor (so use on shared file descriptors is not safe without a PerlIO_seek()). Return value is of type <code>Off_t</code> which is a perl Configure value which may not be same as stdio's <code>off_t</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_getpos(f,p),-PerlIO_setpos(f,p)">
<b>PerlIO_getpos(f,p)</b>, <b>PerlIO_setpos(f,p)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>These correspond (loosely) to fgetpos() and fsetpos(). Rather than stdio's Fpos_t they expect a "Perl Scalar Value" to be passed. What is stored there should be considered opaque. The layout of the data may vary from handle to handle. When not using stdio or if platform does not have the stdio calls then they are implemented in terms of PerlIO_tell() and PerlIO_seek().</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_rewind(f)">
<b>PerlIO_rewind(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to rewind(). It is usually defined as being</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>PerlIO_seek(f,(Off_t)0L, SEEK_SET);
PerlIO_clearerr(f);</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_tmpfile()">
<b>PerlIO_tmpfile()</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to tmpfile(), i.e., returns an anonymous PerlIO or NULL on error. The system will attempt to automatically delete the file when closed. On Unix the file is usually <code>unlink</code>-ed just after it is created so it does not matter how it gets closed. On other systems the file may only be deleted if closed via PerlIO_close() and/or the program exits via <code>exit</code>. Depending on the implementation there may be "race conditions" which allow other processes access to the file, though in general it will be safer in this regard than ad. hoc. schemes.</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_setlinebuf(f)">
<b>PerlIO_setlinebuf(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>This corresponds to setlinebuf(). Does not return a value. What constitutes a "line" is implementation dependent but usually means that writing "\n" flushes the buffer. What happens with things like "this\nthat" is uncertain. (Perl core uses it <i>only</i> when "dumping"; it has nothing to do with $| auto-flush.)</p> </dd> </dl> <h3 id="Co-existence-with-stdio">
Co-existence with stdio</h3> <p>There is outline support for co-existence of PerlIO with stdio. Obviously if PerlIO is implemented in terms of stdio there is no problem. However in other cases then mechanisms must exist to create a FILE * which can be passed to library code which is going to use stdio calls.</p> <p>The first step is to add this line:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">#define PERLIO_NOT_STDIO 0</code></pre> <p><i>before</i> including any perl header files. (This will probably become the default at some point). That prevents "perlio.h" from attempting to #define stdio functions onto PerlIO functions.</p> <p>XS code is probably better using "typemap" if it expects FILE * arguments. The standard typemap will be adjusted to comprehend any changes in this area.</p> <dl> <dt id="PerlIO_importFILE(f,mode)">
<b>PerlIO_importFILE(f,mode)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>Used to get a PerlIO * from a FILE *.</p> <p>The mode argument should be a string as would be passed to fopen/PerlIO_open. If it is NULL then - for legacy support - the code will (depending upon the platform and the implementation) either attempt to empirically determine the mode in which <i>f</i> is open, or use "r+" to indicate a read/write stream.</p> <p>Once called the FILE * should <i>ONLY</i> be closed by calling <code>PerlIO_close()</code> on the returned PerlIO *.</p> <p>The PerlIO is set to textmode. Use PerlIO_binmode if this is not the desired mode.</p> <p>This is <b>not</b> the reverse of PerlIO_exportFILE().</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_exportFILE(f,mode)">
<b>PerlIO_exportFILE(f,mode)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>Given a PerlIO * create a 'native' FILE * suitable for passing to code expecting to be compiled and linked with ANSI C <i>stdio.h</i>. The mode argument should be a string as would be passed to fopen/PerlIO_open. If it is NULL then - for legacy support - the FILE * is opened in same mode as the PerlIO *.</p> <p>The fact that such a FILE * has been 'exported' is recorded, (normally by pushing a new :stdio "layer" onto the PerlIO *), which may affect future PerlIO operations on the original PerlIO *. You should not call <code>fclose()</code> on the file unless you call <code>PerlIO_releaseFILE()</code> to disassociate it from the PerlIO *. (Do not use PerlIO_importFILE() for doing the disassociation.)</p> <p>Calling this function repeatedly will create a FILE * on each call (and will push an :stdio layer each time as well).</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_releaseFILE(p,f)">
<b>PerlIO_releaseFILE(p,f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>Calling PerlIO_releaseFILE informs PerlIO that all use of FILE * is complete. It is removed from the list of 'exported' FILE *s, and the associated PerlIO * should revert to its original behaviour.</p> <p>Use this to disassociate a file from a PerlIO * that was associated using PerlIO_exportFILE().</p> </dd> <dt id="PerlIO_findFILE(f)">
<b>PerlIO_findFILE(f)</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>Returns a native FILE * used by a stdio layer. If there is none, it will create one with PerlIO_exportFILE. In either case the FILE * should be considered as belonging to PerlIO subsystem and should only be closed by calling <code>PerlIO_close()</code>.</p> </dd> </dl> <h3 id='"Fast-gets"-Functions'>
"Fast gets" Functions</h3> <p>In addition to standard-like API defined so far above there is an "implementation" interface which allows perl to get at internals of PerlIO. The following calls correspond to the various FILE_xxx macros determined by Configure - or their equivalent in other implementations. This section is really of interest to only those concerned with detailed perl-core behaviour, implementing a PerlIO mapping or writing code which can make use of the "read ahead" that has been done by the IO system in the same way perl does. Note that any code that uses these interfaces must be prepared to do things the traditional way if a handle does not support them.</p> <dl> <dt id="PerlIO_fast_gets(f)">
