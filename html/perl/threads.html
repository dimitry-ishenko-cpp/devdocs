THREAD CONTEXT</h2> <p>As with subroutines, the type of value returned from a thread's entry point function may be determined by the thread's <i>context</i>: list, scalar or void. The thread's context is determined at thread creation. This is necessary so that the context is available to the entry point function via <a href="perlfunc.html#wantarray">wantarray()</a>. The thread may then specify a value of the appropriate type to be returned from <code>-&gt;join()</code>.</p> <h3 id="Explicit-context">
Explicit context</h3> <p>Because thread creation and thread joining may occur in different contexts, it may be desirable to state the context explicitly to the thread's entry point function. This may be done by calling <code>-&gt;create()</code> with a hash reference as the first argument:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $thr = threads-&gt;create({'context' =&gt; 'list'}, \&amp;foo);
...
my @results = $thr-&gt;join();</code></pre> <p>In the above, the threads object is returned to the parent thread in scalar context, and the thread's entry point function <code>foo</code> will be called in list (array) context such that the parent thread can receive a list (array) from the <code>-&gt;join()</code> call. (<code>'array'</code> is synonymous with <code>'list'</code>.)</p> <p>Similarly, if you need the threads object, but your thread will not be returning a value (i.e., <i>void</i> context), you would do the following:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $thr = threads-&gt;create({'context' =&gt; 'void'}, \&amp;foo);
...
$thr-&gt;join();</code></pre> <p>The context type may also be used as the <i>key</i> in the hash reference followed by a <i>true</i> value:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>threads-&gt;create({'scalar' =&gt; 1}, \&amp;foo);
...
my ($thr) = threads-&gt;list();
my $result = $thr-&gt;join();</code></pre> <h3 id="Implicit-context">
Implicit context</h3> <p>If not explicitly stated, the thread's context is implied from the context of the <code>-&gt;create()</code> call:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code># Create thread in list context
my ($thr) = threads-&gt;create(...);

# Create thread in scalar context
my $thr = threads-&gt;create(...);

# Create thread in void context
threads-&gt;create(...);</code></pre> <h3 id="$thr-&gt;wantarray()">

threads-&gt;wantarray()</h3> <p>Class method to return the current thread's context. This returns the same value as running <a href="perlfunc.html#wantarray">wantarray()</a> inside the current thread's entry point function.</p> <h2 id="THREAD-STACK-SIZE">
THREAD STACK SIZE</h2> <p>The default per-thread stack size for different platforms varies significantly, and is almost always far more than is needed for most applications. On Win32, Perl's makefile explicitly sets the default stack to 16 MB; on most other platforms, the system default is used, which again may be much larger than is needed.</p> <p>By tuning the stack size to more accurately reflect your application's needs, you may significantly reduce your application's memory usage, and increase the number of simultaneously running threads.</p> <p>Note that on Windows, address space allocation granularity is 64 KB, therefore, setting the stack smaller than that on Win32 Perl will not save any more memory.</p> <dl> <dt id="threads-&gt;get_stack_size();">

Trying to set the stack size below this value will result in a warning, and the minimum stack size will be used.</p> <p>Some Linux platforms have a maximum stack size. Setting too large of a stack size will cause thread creation to fail.</p> <p>If needed, <code>$new_size</code> will be rounded up to the next multiple of the memory page size (usually 4096 or 8192).</p> <p>Threads created after the stack size is set will then either call <code>pthread_attr_setstacksize()</code> <i>(for pthreads platforms)</i>, or supply the stack size to <code>CreateThread()</code> <i>(for Win32 Perl)</i>.</p> <p>(Obviously, this call does not affect any currently extant threads.)</p> </dd> <dt id="use-threads-('stack_size'-=&gt;-VALUE);">

    # Thread 'cancellation' signal handler
    $SIG{'KILL'} = sub { threads-&gt;exit(); };

    ...
}

# Create a thread
my $thr = threads-&gt;create('thr_func');

...

# Signal the thread to terminate, and then detach
# it so that it will get cleaned up automatically
$thr-&gt;kill('KILL')-&gt;detach();</code></pre> <p>Here's another simplistic example that illustrates the use of thread signalling in conjunction with a semaphore to provide rudimentary <i>suspend</i> and <i>resume</i> capabilities:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use threads;
use Thread::Semaphore;

sub thr_func
{
    my $sema = shift;

    # Thread 'suspend/resume' signal handler
    $SIG{'STOP'} = sub {
        $sema-&gt;down();      # Thread suspended
        $sema-&gt;up();        # Thread resumes
    };

    ...
}

# Create a semaphore and pass it to a thread
my $sema = Thread::Semaphore-&gt;new();
my $thr = threads-&gt;create('thr_func', $sema);

# Suspend the thread
$sema-&gt;down();
$thr-&gt;kill('STOP');

...

# Allow the thread to continue
$sema-&gt;up();</code></pre> <p>CAVEAT: The thread signalling capability provided by this module does not actually send signals via the OS. It <i>emulates</i> signals at the Perl-level such that signal handlers are called in the appropriate thread. For example, sending <code>$thr-&gt;kill('STOP')</code> does not actually suspend a thread (or the whole process), but does cause a <code>$SIG{'STOP'}</code> handler to be called in that thread (as illustrated above).</p> <p>As such, signals that would normally not be appropriate to use in the <code>kill()</code> command (e.g., <code>kill('KILL', $$)</code>) are okay to use with the <code>-&gt;kill()</code> method (again, as illustrated above).</p> <p>Correspondingly, sending a signal to a thread does not disrupt the operation the thread is currently working on: The signal will be acted upon after the current operation has completed. For instance, if the thread is <i>stuck</i> on an I/O call, sending it a signal will not cause the I/O call to be interrupted such that the signal is acted up immediately.</p> <p>Sending a signal to a terminated/finished thread is ignored.</p> <h2 id="WARNINGS">WARNINGS</h2> <dl> <dt id="Perl-exited-with-active-threads:">

Memory consumption</dt> <dd> <p>On most systems, frequent and continual creation and destruction of threads can lead to ever-increasing growth in the memory footprint of the Perl interpreter. While it is simple to just launch threads and then <code>-&gt;join()</code> or <code>-&gt;detach()</code> them, for long-lived applications, it is better to maintain a pool of threads, and to reuse them for the work needed, using <a href="Thread::Queue.html">queues</a> to notify threads of pending work.

Starting in that release, on systems that implement thread-safe locale functions, threads can be used, with some caveats. This includes Windows starting with Visual Studio 2005, and systems compatible with POSIX 2008. See <a href="perllocale.html#Multi-threaded-operation">"Multi-threaded operation" in perllocale</a>.</p> <p>Each thread (except the main thread) is started using the C locale. The main thread is started like all other Perl programs; see <a href="perllocale.html#ENVIRONMENT">"ENVIRONMENT" in perllocale</a>. You can switch locales in any thread as often as you like.</p> <p>If you want to inherit the parent thread's locale, you can, in the parent, set a variable like so:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$foo = POSIX::setlocale(LC_ALL, NULL);</code></pre> <p>and then pass to threads-&gt;create() a sub that closes over <code>$foo</code>.

Environment variables</dt> <dd> <p>Currently, on all platforms except MSWin32, all <i>system</i> calls (e.g., using <code>system()</code> or back-ticks) made from threads use the environment variable settings from the <i>main</i> thread. In other words, changes made to <code>%ENV</code> in a thread will not be visible in <i>system</i> calls made by that thread.</p> <p>To work around this, set environment variables as part of the <i>system</i> call. For example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $msg = 'hello';

Identity of objects returned from threads</dt> <dd> <p>When a value is returned from a thread through a <code>join</code> operation, the value and everything that it references is copied across to the joining thread, in much the same way that values are copied upon thread creation. This works fine for most kinds of value, including arrays, hashes, and subroutines. The copying recurses through array elements, reference scalars, variables closed over by subroutines, and other kinds of reference.</p> <p>However, everything referenced by the returned value is a fresh copy in the joining thread, even if a returned object had in the child thread been a copy of something that previously existed in the parent thread. After joining, the parent will therefore have a duplicate of each such object.
