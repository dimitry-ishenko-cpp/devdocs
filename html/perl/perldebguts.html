This manpage describes low-level details concerning the debugger's internals, which range from difficult to impossible to understand for anyone who isn't incredibly intimate with Perl's guts. Caveat lector.</p> <h2 id="Debugger-Internals">
Debugger Internals</h2> <p>Perl has special debugging hooks at compile-time and run-time used to create debugging environments. These hooks are not to be confused with the <i>perl -Dxxx</i> command described in <a href="perlrun.html#-Dletters">perlrun</a>, which is usable only if a special Perl is built per the instructions in the <i>INSTALL</i> file in the Perl source tree.</p> <p>For example, whenever you call Perl's built-in <code>caller</code> function from the package <code>DB</code>, the arguments that the corresponding stack frame was called with are copied to the <code>@DB::args</code> array. These mechanisms are enabled by calling Perl with the <b>-d</b> switch. Specifically, the following additional features are enabled (cf. <a href="perlvar.html#%24%5EP">"$^P" in perlvar</a>):</p> <ul> <li>
<p>Perl inserts the contents of <code>$ENV{PERL5DB}</code> (or <code>BEGIN {require 'perl5db.pl'}</code> if not present) before the first line of your program.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Each array <code>@{"_&lt;$filename"}</code> holds the lines of $filename for a file compiled by Perl. The same is also true for <code>eval</code>ed strings that contain subroutines, or which are currently being executed. The $filename for <code>eval</code>ed strings looks like <code>(eval 34)</code>.</p> <p>Values in this array are magical in numeric context: they compare equal to zero only if the line is not breakable.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Each hash <code>%{"_&lt;$filename"}</code> contains breakpoints and actions keyed by line number. Individual entries (as opposed to the whole hash) are settable. Perl only cares about Boolean true here, although the values used by <i>perl5db.pl</i> have the form <code>"$break_condition\0$action"</code>.</p> <p>The same holds for evaluated strings that contain subroutines, or which are currently being executed. The $filename for <code>eval</code>ed strings looks like <code>(eval 34)</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Each scalar <code>${"_&lt;$filename"}</code> contains <code>$filename</code>. This is also the case for evaluated strings that contain subroutines, or which are currently being executed. The <code>$filename</code> for <code>eval</code>ed strings looks like <code>(eval 34)</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>After each <code>require</code>d file is compiled, but before it is executed, <code>DB::postponed(*{"_&lt;$filename"})</code> is called if the subroutine <code>DB::postponed</code> exists. Here, the $filename is the expanded name of the <code>require</code>d file, as found in the values of %INC.</p> </li> <li>
<p>After each subroutine <code>subname</code> is compiled, the existence of <code>$DB::postponed{subname}</code> is checked. If this key exists, <code>DB::postponed(subname)</code> is called if the <code>DB::postponed</code> subroutine also exists.</p> </li> <li>
<p>A hash <code>%DB::sub</code> is maintained, whose keys are subroutine names and whose values have the form <code>filename:startline-endline</code>. <code>filename</code> has the form <code>(eval 34)</code> for subroutines defined inside <code>eval</code>s.</p> </li> <li>
<p>When the execution of your program reaches a point that can hold a breakpoint, the <code>DB::DB()</code> subroutine is called if any of the variables <code>$DB::trace</code>, <code>$DB::single</code>, or <code>$DB::signal</code> is true. These variables are not <code>local</code>izable. This feature is disabled when executing inside <code>DB::DB()</code>, including functions called from it unless <code>$^D &amp; (1&lt;&lt;30)</code> is true.</p> </li> <li>
<p>When execution of the program reaches a subroutine call, a call to <code>&amp;DB::sub</code>(<i>args</i>) is made instead, with <code>$DB::sub</code> set to identify the called subroutine. (This doesn't happen if the calling subroutine was compiled in the <code>DB</code> package.) <code>$DB::sub</code> normally holds the name of the called subroutine, if it has a name by which it can be looked up. Failing that, <code>$DB::sub</code> will hold a reference to the called subroutine. Either way, the <code>&amp;DB::sub</code> subroutine can use <code>$DB::sub</code> as a reference by which to call the called subroutine, which it will normally want to do.</p> <p>If the call is to an lvalue subroutine, and <code>&amp;DB::lsub</code> is defined <code>&amp;DB::lsub</code>(<i>args</i>) is called instead, otherwise falling back to <code>&amp;DB::sub</code>(<i>args</i>).</p> </li> <li>
<p>When execution of the program uses <code>goto</code> to enter a non-XS subroutine and the 0x80 bit is set in <code>$^P</code>, a call to <code>&amp;DB::goto</code> is made, with <code>$DB::sub</code> set to identify the subroutine being entered. The call to <code>&amp;DB::goto</code> does not replace the <code>goto</code>; the requested subroutine will still be entered once <code>&amp;DB::goto</code> has returned. <code>$DB::sub</code> normally holds the name of the subroutine being entered, if it has one. Failing that, <code>$DB::sub</code> will hold a reference to the subroutine being entered. Unlike when <code>&amp;DB::sub</code> is called, it is not guaranteed that <code>$DB::sub</code> can be used as a reference to operate on the subroutine being entered.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note that if <code>&amp;DB::sub</code> needs external data for it to work, no subroutine call is possible without it. As an example, the standard debugger's <code>&amp;DB::sub</code> depends on the <code>$DB::deep</code> variable (it defines how many levels of recursion deep into the debugger you can go before a mandatory break). If <code>$DB::deep</code> is not defined, subroutine calls are not possible, even though <code>&amp;DB::sub</code> exists.</p> <h3 id="Writing-Your-Own-Debugger">
Writing Your Own Debugger</h3> <h4 id="Environment-Variables">
Environment Variables</h4> <p>The <code>PERL5DB</code> environment variable can be used to define a debugger. For example, the minimal "working" debugger (it actually doesn't do anything) consists of one line:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">sub DB::DB {}</code></pre> <p>It can easily be defined like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">$ PERL5DB="sub DB::DB {}" perl -d your-script</code></pre> <p>Another brief debugger, slightly more useful, can be created with only the line:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub DB::DB {print ++$i; scalar &lt;STDIN&gt;}</code></pre> <p>This debugger prints a number which increments for each statement encountered and waits for you to hit a newline before continuing to the next statement.</p> <p>The following debugger is actually useful:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>{
  package DB;
  sub DB  {}
  sub sub {print ++$i, " $sub\n"; &amp;$sub}
}</code></pre> <p>It prints the sequence number of each subroutine call and the name of the called subroutine. Note that <code>&amp;DB::sub</code> is being compiled into the package <code>DB</code> through the use of the <code>package</code> directive.</p> <p>When it starts, the debugger reads your rc file (<i>./.perldb</i> or <i>~/.perldb</i> under Unix), which can set important options. (A subroutine (<code>&amp;afterinit</code>) can be defined here as well; it is executed after the debugger completes its own initialization.)</p> <p>After the rc file is read, the debugger reads the PERLDB_OPTS environment variable and uses it to set debugger options. The contents of this variable are treated as if they were the argument of an <code>o ...</code> debugger command (q.v. in <a href="perldebug.html#Configurable-Options">"Configurable Options" in perldebug</a>).</p> <h4 id="Debugger-Internal-Variables">
Debugger Internal Variables</h4> <p>In addition to the file and subroutine-related variables mentioned above, the debugger also maintains various magical internal variables.</p> <ul> <li>
<p><code>@DB::dbline</code> is an alias for <code>@{"::_&lt;current_file"}</code>, which holds the lines of the currently-selected file (compiled by Perl), either explicitly chosen with the debugger's <code>f</code> command, or implicitly by flow of execution.</p> <p>Values in this array are magical in numeric context: they compare equal to zero only if the line is not breakable.</p> </li> <li>
<p><code>%DB::dbline</code> is an alias for <code>%{"::_&lt;current_file"}</code>, which contains breakpoints and actions keyed by line number in the currently-selected file, either explicitly chosen with the debugger's <code>f</code> command, or implicitly by flow of execution.</p> <p>As previously noted, individual entries (as opposed to the whole hash) are settable. Perl only cares about Boolean true here, although the values used by <i>perl5db.pl</i> have the form <code>"$break_condition\0$action"</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="Debugger-Customization-Functions">
Debugger Customization Functions</h4> <p>Some functions are provided to simplify customization.</p> <ul> <li>
<p>See <a href="perldebug.html#Configurable-Options">"Configurable Options" in perldebug</a> for a description of options parsed by <code>DB::parse_options(string)</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p><code>DB::dump_trace(skip[,count])</code> skips the specified number of frames and returns a list containing information about the calling frames (all of them, if <code>count</code> is missing). Each entry is reference to a hash with keys <code>context</code> (either <code>.</code>, <code>$</code>, or <code>@</code>), <code>sub</code> (subroutine name, or info about <code>eval</code>), <code>args</code> (<code>undef</code> or a reference to an array), <code>file</code>, and <code>line</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p><code>DB::print_trace(FH, skip[, count[, short]])</code> prints formatted info about caller frames. The last two functions may be convenient as arguments to <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code> commands.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note that any variables and functions that are not documented in this manpages (or in <a href="perldebug.html">perldebug</a>) are considered for internal use only, and as such are subject to change without notice.</p> <h2 id="Frame-Listing-Output-Examples">
Frame Listing Output Examples</h2> <p>The <code>frame</code> option can be used to control the output of frame information. For example, contrast this expression trace:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$ perl -de 42

Examples using various values of <code>n</code> are shown to give you a feel for the difference between settings.

Debugging Perl Memory Usage</h2> <p>Perl is a profligate wastrel when it comes to memory use. There is a saying that to estimate memory usage of Perl, assume a reasonable algorithm for memory allocation, multiply that estimate by 10, and while you still may miss the mark, at least you won't be quite so astonished. This is not absolutely true, but may provide a good grasp of what happens.</p> <p>Assume that an integer cannot take less than 20 bytes of memory, a float cannot take less than 24 bytes, a string cannot take less than 32 bytes (all these examples assume 32-bit architectures, the result are quite a bit worse on 64-bit architectures). If a variable is accessed in two of three different ways (which require an integer, a float, or a string), the memory footprint may increase yet another 20 bytes. A sloppy malloc(3) implementation can inflate these numbers dramatically.</p> <p>On the opposite end of the scale, a declaration like</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub foo;</code></pre> <p>may take up to 500 bytes of memory, depending on which release of Perl you're running.</p> <p>Anecdotal estimates of source-to-compiled code bloat suggest an eightfold increase. This means that the compiled form of reasonable (normally commented, properly indented etc.) code will take about eight times more space in memory than the code took on disk.</p> <p>The <b>-DL</b> command-line switch is obsolete since circa Perl 5.6.0 (it was available only if Perl was built with <code>-DDEBUGGING</code>). The switch was used to track Perl's memory allocations and possible memory leaks. These days the use of malloc debugging tools like <i>Purify</i> or <i>valgrind</i> is suggested instead. See also <a href="perlhacktips.html#PERL_MEM_LOG">"PERL_MEM_LOG" in perlhacktips</a>.</p> <p>One way to find out how much memory is being used by Perl data structures is to install the Devel::Size module from CPAN: it gives you the minimum number of bytes required to store a particular data structure. Please be mindful of the difference between the size() and total_size().</p> <p>If Perl has been compiled using Perl's malloc you can analyze Perl memory usage by setting $ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}.</p> <h3 id="Using-$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}">
Using <code>$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}</code>
</h3> <p>If your perl is using Perl's malloc() and was compiled with the necessary switches (this is the default), then it will print memory usage statistics after compiling your code when <code>$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} &gt; 1</code>, and before termination of the program when <code>$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} &gt;= 1</code>. The report format is similar to the following example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext"> $ PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS=2 perl -e "require Carp"

<code>buckets SMALLEST(APPROX)..GREATEST(APPROX)</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Perl's malloc() uses bucketed allocations. Every request is rounded up to the closest bucket size available, and a bucket is taken from the pool of buckets of that size.</p> <p>The line above describes the limits of buckets currently in use. Each bucket has two sizes: memory footprint and the maximal size of user data that can fit into this bucket. Suppose in the above example that the smallest bucket were size 4. The biggest bucket would have usable size 8188, and the memory footprint would be 8192.</p> <p>In a Perl built for debugging, some buckets may have negative usable size. This means that these buckets cannot (and will not) be used. For larger buckets, the memory footprint may be one page greater than a power of 2. If so, the corresponding power of two is printed in the <code>APPROX</code> field above.</p> </dd> <dt id="Free/Used">
Free/Used</dt> <dd> <p>The 1 or 2 rows of numbers following that correspond to the number of buckets of each size between <code>SMALLEST</code> and <code>GREATEST</code>. In the first row, the sizes (memory footprints) of buckets are powers of two--or possibly one page greater. In the second row, if present, the memory footprints of the buckets are between the memory footprints of two buckets "above".</p> <p>For example, suppose under the previous example, the memory footprints were</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">   free:    8     16    32    64    128  256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192
	   4     12    24    48    80</code></pre> <p>With a non-<code>DEBUGGING</code> perl, the buckets starting from <code>128</code> have a 4-byte overhead, and thus an 8192-long bucket may take up to 8188-byte allocations.</p> </dd> <dt id="Total-sbrk():-SBRKed/SBRKs:CONTINUOUS">
<code>Total sbrk(): SBRKed/SBRKs:CONTINUOUS</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>The first two fields give the total amount of memory perl sbrk(2)ed (ess-broken? :-) and number of sbrk(2)s used. The third number is what perl thinks about continuity of returned chunks. So long as this number is positive, malloc() will assume that it is probable that sbrk(2) will provide continuous memory.</p> <p>Memory allocated by external libraries is not counted.</p> </dd> <dt id="pad:-0">
<code>pad: 0</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>The amount of sbrk(2)ed memory needed to keep buckets aligned.</p> </dd> <dt id="heads:-2192">
<code>heads: 2192</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Although memory overhead of bigger buckets is kept inside the bucket, for smaller buckets, it is kept in separate areas. This field gives the total size of these areas.</p> </dd> <dt id="chain:-0">
<code>chain: 0</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>malloc() may want to subdivide a bigger bucket into smaller buckets. If only a part of the deceased bucket is left unsubdivided, the rest is kept as an element of a linked list. This field gives the total size of these chunks.</p> </dd> <dt id="tail:-6144">
<code>tail: 6144</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>To minimize the number of sbrk(2)s, malloc() asks for more memory. This field gives the size of the yet unused part, which is sbrk(2)ed, but never touched.</p> </dd> </dl> <h2 id="SEE-ALSO">
