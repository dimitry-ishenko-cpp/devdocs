A ping object is first created with optional parameters, a variable number of hosts may be pinged multiple times and then the connection is closed.</p> <p>You may choose one of six different protocols to use for the ping. The "tcp" protocol is the default. Note that a live remote host may still fail to be pingable by one or more of these protocols. For example, www.microsoft.com is generally alive but not "icmp" pingable.</p> <p>With the "tcp" protocol the ping() method attempts to establish a connection to the remote host's echo port. If the connection is successfully established, the remote host is considered reachable. No data is actually echoed. This protocol does not require any special privileges but has higher overhead than the "udp" and "icmp" protocols.</p> <p>Specifying the "udp" protocol causes the ping() method to send a udp packet to the remote host's echo port. If the echoed packet is received from the remote host and the received packet contains the same data as the packet that was sent, the remote host is considered reachable. This protocol does not require any special privileges. It should be borne in mind that, for a udp ping, a host will be reported as unreachable if it is not running the appropriate echo service. For Unix-like systems see <a href="http://man.he.net/man8/inetd">inetd(8)</a> for more information.</p> <p>If the "icmp" protocol is specified, the ping() method sends an icmp echo message to the remote host, which is what the UNIX ping program does. If the echoed message is received from the remote host and the echoed information is correct, the remote host is considered reachable. Specifying the "icmp" protocol requires that the program be run as root or that the program be setuid to root.</p> <p>If the "external" protocol is specified, the ping() method attempts to use the <code>Net::Ping::External</code> module to ping the remote host. <code>Net::Ping::External</code> interfaces with your system's default <code>ping</code> utility to perform the ping, and generally produces relatively accurate results. If <code>Net::Ping::External</code> if not installed on your system, specifying the "external" protocol will result in an error.</p> <p>If the "syn" protocol is specified, the <a href="#ping">"ping"</a> method will only send a TCP SYN packet to the remote host then immediately return. If the syn packet was sent successfully, it will return a true value, otherwise it will return false. NOTE: Unlike the other protocols, the return value does NOT determine if the remote host is alive or not since the full TCP three-way handshake may not have completed yet. The remote host is only considered reachable if it receives a TCP ACK within the timeout specified. To begin waiting for the ACK packets, use the <a href="#ack">"ack"</a> method as explained below. Use the "syn" protocol instead the "tcp" protocol to determine reachability of multiple destinations simultaneously by sending parallel TCP SYN packets. It will not block while testing each remote host. This protocol does not require any special privileges.</p> <h3 id="Functions">Functions</h3> <dl> <dt id="Net::Ping-&gt;new([proto,-timeout,-bytes,-device,-tos,-ttl,-family,-host,-port,-bind,-gateway,-retrans,-pingstring,-source_verify-econnrefused-dontfrag-IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU-IPV6_RECVPATHMTU])">

All of the parameters are optional and can be passed as hash ref. All options besides the first 7 must be passed as hash ref.</p> <p><code>proto</code> specifies the protocol to use when doing a ping. The current choices are "tcp", "udp", "icmp", "icmpv6", "stream", "syn", or "external". The default is "tcp".</p> <p>If a <code>timeout</code> in seconds is provided, it is used when a timeout is not given to the ping() method (below). The timeout must be greater than 0 and the default, if not specified, is 5 seconds.</p> <p>If the number of data bytes (<code>bytes</code>) is given, that many data bytes are included in the ping packet sent to the remote host. The number of data bytes is ignored if the protocol is "tcp". The minimum (and default) number of data bytes is 1 if the protocol is "udp" and 0 otherwise. The maximum number of data bytes that can be specified is 65535, but staying below the MTU (1472 bytes for ICMP) is recommended. Many small devices cannot deal with fragmented ICMP packets.</p> <p>If <code>device</code> is given, this device is used to bind the source endpoint before sending the ping packet. I believe this only works with superuser privileges and with udp and icmp protocols at this time.</p> <p>If &lt;tos&gt; is given, this ToS is configured into the socket.</p> <p>For icmp, <code>ttl</code> can be specified to set the TTL of the outgoing packet.</p> <p>Valid <code>family</code> values for IPv4:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">4, v4, ip4, ipv4, AF_INET (constant)</code></pre> <p>Valid <code>family</code> values for IPv6:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">6, v6, ip6, ipv6, AF_INET6 (constant)</code></pre> <p>The <code>host</code> argument implicitly specifies the family if the family argument is not given.</p> <p>The <code>port</code> argument is only valid for a udp, tcp or stream ping, and will not do what you think it does. ping returns true when we get a "Connection refused"! The default is the echo port.</p> <p>The <code>bind</code> argument specifies the local_addr to bind to. By specifying a bind argument you don't need the bind method.</p> <p>The <code>gateway</code> argument is only valid for IPv6, and requires a IPv6 address.</p> <p>The <code>retrans</code> argument the exponential backoff rate, default 1.2. It matches the $def_factor global.</p> <p>The <code>dontfrag</code> argument sets the IP_DONTFRAG bit, but note that IP_DONTFRAG is not yet defined by Socket, and not available on many systems. Then it is ignored. On linux it also sets IP_MTU_DISCOVER to IP_PMTUDISC_DO but need we don't chunk oversized packets.

The optional timeout must be greater than 0 seconds and defaults to whatever was specified when the ping object was created. Returns a success flag. If the hostname cannot be found or there is a problem with the IP number, the success flag returned will be undef. Otherwise, the success flag will be 1 if the host is reachable and 0 if it is not. For most practical purposes, undef and 0 and can be treated as the same case. In array context, the elapsed time as well as the string form of the ip the host resolved to are also returned.

Normally, if the remote server reported ECONNREFUSED, it must have been reachable because of the status packet that it reported. With this option enabled, the full three-way tcp handshake must have been established successfully before it will claim it is reachable. NOTE: It still does nothing more than connect and disconnect. It does not speak any protocol (i.e., HTTP or FTP) to ensure the remote server is sane in any way. The remote server CPU could be grinding to a halt and unresponsive to any clients connecting, but if the kernel throws the ACK packet, it is considered alive anyway. To really determine if the server is responding well would be application specific and is beyond the scope of Net::Ping. For udp protocol, enabling this option demands that the remote server replies with the same udp data that it was sent as defined by the udp echo service.</p> <p>This affects the "udp", "tcp", and "syn" protocols.</p> <p>This is disabled by default.</p> </dd> <dt id="$p-&gt;tcp_service_check(-{-0-|-1-}-);">

The tcp protocol will generate 2.5 times or more traffic for each ping than either udp or icmp. If many hosts are pinged frequently, you may wish to implement a small wait (e.g. 25ms or more) between each ping to avoid flooding your network with packets.</p> <p>The icmp and icmpv6 protocols requires that the program be run as root or that it be setuid to root. The other protocols do not require special privileges, but not all network devices implement tcp or udp echo.</p> <p>Local hosts should normally respond to pings within milliseconds. However, on a very congested network it may take up to 3 seconds or longer to receive an echo packet from the remote host. If the timeout is set too low under these conditions, it will appear that the remote host is not reachable (which is almost the truth).</p> <p>Reachability doesn't necessarily mean that the remote host is actually functioning beyond its ability to echo packets. tcp is slightly better at indicating the health of a system than icmp because it uses more of the networking stack to respond.</p> <p>Because of a lack of anything better, this module uses its own routines to pack and unpack ICMP packets. It would be better for a separate module to be written which understands all of the different kinds of ICMP packets.</p> <h2 id="INSTALL">INSTALL</h2> <p>The latest source tree is available via git:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">git clone https://github.com/rurban/Net-Ping.git
