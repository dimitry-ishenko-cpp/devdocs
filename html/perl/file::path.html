ERROR HANDLING</h3> <dl> <dt id="NOTE:">
<b>NOTE:</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>The following error handling mechanism is consistent throughout all code paths EXCEPT in cases where the ROOT node is nonexistent. In version 2.11 the maintainers attempted to rectify this inconsistency but too many downstream modules encountered problems. In such case, if you require root node evaluation or error checking prior to calling <code>make_path</code> or <code>remove_tree</code>, you should take additional precautions.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>If <code>make_path</code> or <code>remove_tree</code> encounters an error, a diagnostic message will be printed to <code>STDERR</code> via <code>carp</code> (for non-fatal errors) or via <code>croak</code> (for fatal errors).</p> <p>If this behaviour is not desirable, the <code>error</code> attribute may be used to hold a reference to a variable, which will be used to store the diagnostics. The variable is made a reference to an array of hash references. Each hash contain a single key/value pair where the key is the name of the file, and the value is the error message (including the contents of <code>$!</code> when appropriate). If a general error is encountered the diagnostic key will be empty.</p> <p>An example usage looks like:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>remove_tree( 'foo/bar', 'bar/rat', {error =&gt; \my $err} );
if ($err &amp;&amp; @$err) {
    for my $diag (@$err) {
        my ($file, $message) = %$diag;
        if ($file eq '') {
            print "general error: $message\n";
        }
        else {
            print "problem unlinking $file: $message\n";
        }
    }
}
else {
    print "No error encountered\n";
}</code></pre> <p>Note that if no errors are encountered, <code>$err</code> will reference an empty array. This means that <code>$err</code> will always end up TRUE; so you need to test <code>@$err</code> to determine if errors occurred.</p> <h3 id="NOTES">NOTES</h3> <p><code>File::Path</code> blindly exports <code>mkpath</code> and <code>rmtree</code> into the current namespace. These days, this is considered bad style, but to change it now would break too much code. Nonetheless, you are invited to specify what it is you are expecting to use:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use File::Path 'rmtree';</code></pre> <p>The routines <code>make_path</code> and <code>remove_tree</code> are <b>not</b> exported by default. You must specify which ones you want to use.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use File::Path 'remove_tree';</code></pre> <p>Note that a side-effect of the above is that <code>mkpath</code> and <code>rmtree</code> are no longer exported at all. This is due to the way the <code>Exporter</code> module works. If you are migrating a codebase to use the new interface, you will have to list everything explicitly. But that's just good practice anyway.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use File::Path qw(remove_tree rmtree);</code></pre> <h4 id="API-CHANGES">
API CHANGES</h4> <p>The API was changed in the 2.0 branch. For a time, <code>mkpath</code> and <code>rmtree</code> tried, unsuccessfully, to deal with the two different calling mechanisms. This approach was considered a failure.</p> <p>The new semantics are now only available with <code>make_path</code> and <code>remove_tree</code>. The old semantics are only available through <code>mkpath</code> and <code>rmtree</code>. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to at least 2.08 in order to avoid surprises.</p> <h4 id="SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS">
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS</h4> <p>There were race conditions in the 1.x implementations of File::Path's <code>rmtree</code> function (although sometimes patched depending on the OS distribution or platform). The 2.0 version contains code to avoid the problem mentioned in CVE-2002-0435.</p> <p>See the following pages for more information:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=286905
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2005/01/msg97623.html
http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-696</code></pre> <p>Additionally, unless the <code>safe</code> parameter is set (or the third parameter in the traditional interface is TRUE), should a <code>remove_tree</code> be interrupted, files that were originally in read-only mode may now have their permissions set to a read-write (or "delete OK") mode.</p> <p>The following CVE reports were previously filed against File-Path and are believed to have been addressed:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><a href="http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2004-0452">http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2004-0452</a></p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2005-0448">http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2005-0448</a></p> </li> </ul> <p>In February 2017 the cPanel Security Team reported an additional vulnerability in File-Path. The <code>chmod()</code> logic to make directories traversable can be abused to set the mode on an attacker-chosen file to an attacker-chosen value. This is due to the time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) race condition (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use</a>) between the <code>stat()</code> that decides the inode is a directory and the <code>chmod()</code> that tries to make it user-rwx. CPAN versions 2.13 and later incorporate a patch provided by John Lightsey to address this problem. This vulnerability has been reported as CVE-2017-6512.</p> <h2 id="DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</h2> <p>FATAL errors will cause the program to halt (<code>croak</code>), since the problem is so severe that it would be dangerous to continue. (This can always be trapped with <code>eval</code>, but it's not a good idea. Under the circumstances, dying is the best thing to do).</p> <p>SEVERE errors may be trapped using the modern interface. If the they are not trapped, or if the old interface is used, such an error will cause the program will halt.</p> <p>All other errors may be trapped using the modern interface, otherwise they will be <code>carp</code>ed about.

NFS Mount Points</h3> <p><i>File::Path</i> is not responsible for triggering the automounts, mirror mounts, and the contents of network mounted filesystems. If your NFS implementation requires an action to be performed on the filesystem in order for <i>File::Path</i> to perform operations, it is strongly suggested you assure filesystem availability by reading the root of the mounted filesystem.</p> <h3 id="REPORTING-BUGS">
REPORTING BUGS</h3> <p>Please report all bugs on the RT queue, either via the web interface:</p> <p><a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=File-Path">http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=File-Path</a></p> <p>or by email:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>bug-File-Path@rt.cpan.org</code></pre> <p>In either case, please <b>attach</b> patches to the bug report rather than including them inline in the web post or the body of the email.</p> <p>You can also send pull requests to the Github repository:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/rpcme/File-Path">https://github.com/rpcme/File-Path</a></p> <h2 id="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2> <p>Paul Szabo identified the race condition originally, and Brendan O'Dea wrote an implementation for Debian that addressed the problem. That code was used as a basis for the current code. Their efforts are greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Gisle Aas made a number of improvements to the documentation for 2.07 and his advice and assistance is also greatly appreciated.</p> <h2 id="AUTHORS">AUTHORS</h2> <p>Prior authors and maintainers: Tim Bunce, Charles Bailey, and David Landgren &lt;<i>david@landgren.net</i>&gt;.</p> <p>Current maintainers are Richard Elberger &lt;<i>riche@cpan.org</i>&gt; and James (Jim) Keenan &lt;<i>jkeenan@cpan.org</i>&gt;.</p> <h2 id="CONTRIBUTORS">CONTRIBUTORS</h2> <p>Contributors to File::Path, in alphabetical order by first name.</p> <dl> <dt id="bulkdd@cpan.org&gt;">
