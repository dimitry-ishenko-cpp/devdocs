   <h1>In-Memory Databases</h1> <p>An SQLite database is normally stored in a single ordinary disk file. However, in certain circumstances, the database might be stored in memory.</p> <p>The most common way to force an SQLite database to exist purely in memory is to open the database using the special filename "<b>:memory:</b>". In other words, instead of passing the name of a real disk file into one of the <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open()</a>, <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open16()</a>, or <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open_v2()</a> functions, pass in the string ":memory:". For example:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
rc = sqlite3_open(":memory:", &amp;db);
</pre> <p>When this is done, no disk file is opened. Instead, a new database is created purely in memory. The database ceases to exist as soon as the database connection is closed. Every :memory: database is distinct from every other. So, opening two database connections each with the filename ":memory:" will create two independent in-memory databases.</p> <p>The special filename ":memory:" can be used anywhere that a database filename is permitted. For example, it can be used as the <i>filename</i> in an <a href="lang_attach.html">ATTACH</a> command:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
ATTACH DATABASE ':memory:' AS aux1;
</pre> <p>Note that in order for the special ":memory:" name to apply and to create a pure in-memory database, there must be no additional text in the filename. Thus, a disk-based database can be created in a file by prepending a pathname, like this: "./:memory:".</p> <p>The special ":memory:" filename also works when using <a href="uri.html">URI filenames</a>. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">
rc = sqlite3_open("file::memory:", &amp;db);
</pre> Or, <pre data-language="sql">
ATTACH DATABASE 'file::memory:' AS aux1;
</pre>  <h2 id="sharedmemdb">In-memory Databases And Shared Cache</h2> <p>In-memory databases are allowed to use <a href="sharedcache.html">shared cache</a> if they are opened using a <a href="uri.html">URI filename</a>. If the unadorned ":memory:" name is used to specify the in-memory database, then that database always has a private cache and is only visible to the database connection that originally opened it. However, the same in-memory database can be opened by two or more database connections as follows: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">
rc = sqlite3_open("file::memory:?cache=shared", &amp;db);
</pre> Or, <pre data-language="sql">
ATTACH DATABASE 'file::memory:?cache=shared' AS aux1;
</pre> <p>This allows separate database connections to share the same in-memory database. Of course, all database connections sharing the in-memory database need to be in the same process. The database is automatically deleted and memory is reclaimed when the last connection to the database closes. </p>
<p>If two or more distinct but shareable in-memory databases are needed in a single process, then the <a href="uri.html#coreqp">mode=memory</a> query parameter can be used with a <a href="uri.html">URI filename</a> to create a named in-memory database: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">
rc = sqlite3_open("file:memdb1?mode=memory&amp;cache=shared", &amp;db);
</pre> Or, <pre data-language="sql">
ATTACH DATABASE 'file:memdb1?mode=memory&amp;cache=shared' AS aux1;
</pre> <p>When an in-memory database is named in this way, it will only share its cache with another connection that uses exactly the same name.  </p>
<a name="temp_db" id="temp_db"></a><h2>Temporary Databases</h2> <p>When the name of the database file handed to <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open()</a> or to <a href="lang_attach.html">ATTACH</a> is an empty string, then a new temporary file is created to hold the database.</p> <pre data-language="sql">
rc = sqlite3_open("", &amp;db);
</pre> <pre data-language="sql">
ATTACH DATABASE '' AS aux2;
</pre> <p>A different temporary file is created each time so that, just as with the special ":memory:" string, two database connections to temporary databases each have their own private database. Temporary databases are automatically deleted when the connection that created them closes.</p> <p>Even though a disk file is allocated for each temporary database, in practice the temporary database usually resides in the in-memory pager cache and hence there is very little difference between a pure in-memory database created by ":memory:" and a temporary database created by an empty filename. The sole difference is that a ":memory:" database must remain in memory at all times whereas parts of a temporary database might be flushed to disk if the database becomes large or if SQLite comes under memory pressure.</p> <p>The previous paragraphs describe the behavior of temporary databases under the default SQLite configuration. An application can use the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_temp_store">temp_store pragma</a> and the <a href="compile.html#temp_store">SQLITE_TEMP_STORE</a> compile-time parameter to force temporary databases to behave as pure in-memory databases, if desired. </p> <div class="_attribution">
