<span>1. </span>Introduction</h1> <p>Generated columns (also sometimes called "computed columns") are columns of a table whose values are a function of other columns in the same row. Generated columns can be read, but their values can not be directly written. The only way to change the value of a generated column is to modify the values of the other columns used to calculate the generated column. </p>
<h1 id="syntax">
<span>2. </span>Syntax</h1> <p>Syntactically, generated columns are designated using a "GENERATED ALWAYS" <a href="syntax/column-constraint.html">column-constraint</a>. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE t1(
   a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   b INT,
   c TEXT,
   d INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (a*abs(b)) VIRTUAL,
   e TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (substr(c,b,b+1)) STORED
);
</pre> <p>The statement above has three ordinary columns, "a" (the PRIMARY KEY), "b", and "c", and two generated columns "d" and "e". </p>
<p>The "GENERATED ALWAYS" keywords at the beginning of the constraint and the "VIRTUAL" or "STORED" keyword at the end are all optional. Only the "AS" keyword and the parenthesized expression are required. If the trailing "VIRTUAL" or "STORED" keyword is omitted, then VIRTUAL is the default. Hence, the example statement above could be simplified to just: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE t1(
   a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   b INT,
   c TEXT,
   d INT AS (a*abs(b)),
   e TEXT AS (substr(c,b,b+1)) STORED
);
</pre> <h2 id="virtual_versus_stored_columns">
<span>2.1. </span>VIRTUAL versus STORED columns</h2> <p>Generated columns can be either VIRTUAL or STORED. The value of a VIRTUAL column is computed when read, whereas the value of a STORED column is computed when the row is written. STORED columns take up space in the database file, whereas VIRTUAL columns use more CPU cycles when being read. </p>
<p>From the point of view of SQL, STORED and VIRTUAL columns are almost exactly the same. Queries against either class of generated column produce the same results. The only functional difference is that one cannot add new STORED columns using the <a href="lang_altertable.html#altertabaddcol">ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN</a> command. Only VIRTUAL columns can be added using ALTER TABLE. </p>
<h2 id="capabilities">
<span>2.2. </span>Capabilities</h2> <ol> <li><p> Generated columns can have a datatype. SQLite attempts to transform the result of the generating expression into that datatype using the same <a href="datatype3.html#affinity">affinity</a> rules as for ordinary columns. </p></li>
<li><p> Generated columns may have NOT NULL, CHECK, and UNIQUE constraints, and foreign key constraints, just like ordinary columns. </p></li>
<li><p> Generated columns can participate in indexes, just like ordinary columns. </p></li>
<li><p> The expression of a generated column can refer to any of the other declared columns in the table, including other generated columns, as long as the expression does not directly or indirectly refer back to itself. </p></li>
<li><p> Generated columns can occur anywhere in the table definition. Generated columns can be interspersed among ordinary columns. It is not necessary to put generated columns at the end of the list of columns in the table definition, as is shown in the examples above. </p></li>
</ol> <h2 id="limitations">
<span>2.3. </span>Limitations</h2> <ol> <li><p> Generated columns may not have a <a href="lang_createtable.html#dfltval">default value</a> (they may not use the "DEFAULT" clause). The value of a generated column is always the value specified by the expression that follows the "AS" keyword. </p></li>
<li><p> Generated columns may not be used as part of the <a href="lang_createtable.html#primkeyconst">PRIMARY KEY</a>. (Future versions of SQLite might relax this constraint for STORED columns.) </p></li>
<li><p> The expression of a generated column may only reference constant literals and columns within the same row, and may only use scalar <a href="deterministic.html">deterministic functions</a>. The expression may not use subqueries, aggregate functions, window functions, or table-valued functions. </p></li>
<li><p> The expression of a generated column may refer to other generated columns in the same row, but no generated column can depend upon itself, either directly or indirectly. </p></li>
<li><p>The expression of a generated column may not directly reference the <a href="lang_createtable.html#rowid">ROWID</a>, though it can reference the <a href="lang_createtable.html#rowid">INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</a> column, which is often the same thing. </p></li>
<li><p> Every table must have at least one non-generated column. </p></li>
<li><p> It is not possible to <a href="lang_altertable.html#altertabaddcol">ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN</a> a STORED column. One can add a VIRTUAL column, however. </p></li>
<li><p> The datatype and <a href="datatype3.html#collation">collating sequence</a> of the generated column are determined only by the datatype and <a href="lang_createtable.html#collateclause">COLLATE clause</a> on the column definition. The datatype and collating sequence of the GENERATED ALWAYS AS expression have no affect on the datatype and collating sequence of the column itself. </p></li>
<li><p> Generated columns are not included in the list of columns provided by the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_table_info">PRAGMA table_info</a> statement. But they are included in the output of the newer <a href="pragma.html#pragma_table_xinfo">PRAGMA table_xinfo</a> statement. </p></li>
</ol> <h1 id="compatibility">
<span>3. </span>Compatibility</h1> <p>Generated column support was added with SQLite version 3.31.0 (2020-01-22). If an earlier version of SQLite attempts to read a database file that contains a generated column in its schema, then that earlier version will perceive the generated column syntax as an error and will report that the database schema is corrupt. </p>
<p>To clarify: SQLite version 3.31.0 can read and write any database created by any prior version of SQLite going back to SQLite 3.0.0 (2004-06-18). And, earlier versions of SQLite, prior to 3.31.0, can read and write databases created by SQLite version 3.31.0 and later as long as the database schema does not contain features, such as generated columns, that are not understood by the earlier version. Problems only arise if you create a new database that contains generated columns, using SQLite version 3.31.0 or later, and then try to read or write that database file using an earlier version of SQLite that does not understand generated columns. </p>
