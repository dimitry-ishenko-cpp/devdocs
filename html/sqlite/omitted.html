   <h1>SQL Features That SQLite Does Not Implement</h1> <p> SQLite implements most of the common features of SQL. Rather than try to list all the features of SQL that SQLite does support, it is much easier to list those that it does not. Unsupported features of SQL are shown below.</p> <p> See also the <a href="quirks.html">Quirks, Caveats, and Gotchas</a> of SQLite. </p>
<table cellpadding="10"> <tr>
<td valign="top"><b><nobr>Complete ALTER TABLE support</nobr></b></td>
<td width="10"> </td>
<td valign="top"> Only the RENAME TABLE, ADD COLUMN, RENAME COLUMN, and DROP COLUMN variants of the ALTER TABLE command are supported. Other kinds of ALTER TABLE operations such as ALTER COLUMN, ADD CONSTRAINT, and so forth are omitted. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b><nobr>Complete trigger support</nobr></b></td>
<td width="10"> </td>
<td valign="top"> FOR EACH ROW triggers are supported but not FOR EACH STATEMENT triggers. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b><nobr>Writing to VIEWs</nobr></b></td>
<td width="10"> </td>
<td valign="top"> VIEWs in SQLite are read-only. You may not execute a DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE statement on a view. But you can create a trigger that fires on an attempt to DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE a view and do what you need in the body of the trigger. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b><nobr>GRANT and REVOKE</nobr></b></td>
<td width="10"> </td>
<td valign="top"> Since SQLite reads and writes an ordinary disk file, the only access permissions that can be applied are the normal file access permissions of the underlying operating system. The GRANT and REVOKE commands commonly found on client/server RDBMSes are not implemented because they would be meaningless for an embedded database engine. </td>
