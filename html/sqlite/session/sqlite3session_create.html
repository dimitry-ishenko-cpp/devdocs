   <h1>Create A New Session Object</h1>
<pre data-language="sql">int sqlite3session_create(
  sqlite3 *db,                    /* Database handle */
  const char *zDb,                /* Name of db (e.g. "main") */

<p> Create a new session object attached to database handle db. If successful, a pointer to the new object is written to *ppSession and SQLITE_OK is returned. If an error occurs, *ppSession is set to NULL and an SQLite error code (e.g. SQLITE_NOMEM) is returned.</p> <p>It is possible to create multiple session objects attached to a single database handle.</p> <p>Session objects created using this function should be deleted using the <a href="sqlite3session_delete.html">sqlite3session_delete()</a> function before the database handle that they are attached to is itself closed. If the database handle is closed before the session object is deleted, then the results of calling any session module function, including <a href="sqlite3session_delete.html">sqlite3session_delete()</a> on the session object are undefined.</p> <p>Because the session module uses the <a href="../c3ref/preupdate_blobwrite.html">sqlite3_preupdate_hook()</a> API, it is not possible for an application to register a pre-update hook on a database handle that has one or more session objects attached. Nor is it possible to create a session object attached to a database handle for which a pre-update hook is already defined. The results of attempting either of these things are undefined.</p> <p>The session object will be used to create changesets for tables in database zDb, where zDb is either "main", or "temp", or the name of an attached database. It is not an error if database zDb is not attached to the database when the session object is created. </p>
