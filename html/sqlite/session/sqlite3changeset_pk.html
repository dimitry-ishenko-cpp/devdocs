   <h1>Obtain The Primary Key Definition Of A Table</h1>
<pre data-language="sql">int sqlite3changeset_pk(
  sqlite3_changeset_iter *pIter,  /* Iterator object */
  unsigned char **pabPK,          /* OUT: Array of boolean - true for PK cols */
  int *pnCol                      /* OUT: Number of entries in output array */
);
</pre>
<p> For each modified table, a changeset includes the following:</p> <p></p>
<ul> <li> The number of columns in the table, and </li>
<li> Which of those columns make up the tables PRIMARY KEY. </li>
</ul> <p>This function is used to find which columns comprise the PRIMARY KEY of the table modified by the change that iterator pIter currently points to. If successful, *pabPK is set to point to an array of nCol entries, where nCol is the number of columns in the table. Elements of *pabPK are set to 0x01 if the corresponding column is part of the tables primary key, or 0x00 if it is not.</p> <p>If argument pnCol is not NULL, then *pnCol is set to the number of columns in the table.</p> <p>If this function is called when the iterator does not point to a valid entry, SQLITE_MISUSE is returned and the output variables zeroed. Otherwise, SQLITE_OK is returned and the output variables populated as described above. </p>
