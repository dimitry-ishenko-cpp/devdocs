   <h1>Invert A Changeset</h1>
<pre data-language="sql">int sqlite3changeset_invert(

</pre>
<p> This function is used to "invert" a changeset object. Applying an inverted changeset to a database reverses the effects of applying the uninverted changeset. Specifically:</p> <p></p>
<ul> <li> Each DELETE change is changed to an INSERT, and </li>
<li> Each INSERT change is changed to a DELETE, and </li>
<li> For each UPDATE change, the old.* and new.* values are exchanged. </li>
</ul> <p>This function does not change the order in which changes appear within the changeset. It merely reverses the sense of each individual change.</p> <p>If successful, a pointer to a buffer containing the inverted changeset is stored in *ppOut, the size of the same buffer is stored in *pnOut, and SQLITE_OK is returned. If an error occurs, both *pnOut and *ppOut are zeroed and an SQLite error code returned.</p> <p>It is the responsibility of the caller to eventually call sqlite3_free() on the *ppOut pointer to free the buffer allocation following a successful call to this function.</p> <p>WARNING/TODO: This function currently assumes that the input is a valid changeset. If it is not, the results are undefined. </p>
