      <h1>Flags for the xAccess VFS method</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
#define SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS    0
#define SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE 1   /* Used by PRAGMA temp_store_directory */
#define SQLITE_ACCESS_READ      2   /* Unused */
</pre> <p> These integer constants can be used as the third parameter to the xAccess method of an <a href="vfs.html">sqlite3_vfs</a> object. They determine what kind of permissions the xAccess method is looking for. With SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS, the xAccess method simply checks whether the file exists. With SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE, the xAccess method checks whether the named directory is both readable and writable (in other words, if files can be added, removed, and renamed within the directory). The SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE constant is currently used only by the <a href="../pragma.html#pragma_temp_store_directory">temp_store_directory pragma</a>, though this could change in a future release of SQLite. With SQLITE_ACCESS_READ, the xAccess method checks whether the file is readable. The SQLITE_ACCESS_READ constant is currently unused, though it might be used in a future release of SQLite. </p>
