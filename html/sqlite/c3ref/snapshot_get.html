int sqlite3_snapshot_get(

</pre> <p> The <a href="snapshot_get.html">sqlite3_snapshot_get(D,S,P)</a> interface attempts to make a new <a href="snapshot.html">sqlite3_snapshot</a> object that records the current state of schema S in database connection D. On success, the <a href="snapshot_get.html">sqlite3_snapshot_get(D,S,P)</a> interface writes a pointer to the newly created <a href="snapshot.html">sqlite3_snapshot</a> object into *P and returns SQLITE_OK. If there is not already a read-transaction open on schema S when this function is called, one is opened automatically.</p> <p>The following must be true for this function to succeed. If any of the following statements are false when sqlite3_snapshot_get() is called, SQLITE_ERROR is returned. The final value of *P is undefined in this case.</p> <p></p>
<ul> <li> The database handle must not be in <a href="get_autocommit.html">autocommit mode</a>. <p></p>
</li>
<li> Schema S of <a href="sqlite3.html">database connection</a> D must be a <a href="../wal.html">WAL mode</a> database. <p></p>
</li>
<li> There must not be a write transaction open on schema S of database connection D. <p></p>
</li>
<li> One or more transactions must have been written to the current wal file since it was created on disk (by any connection). This means that a snapshot cannot be taken on a wal mode database with no wal file immediately after it is first opened. At least one transaction must be written to it first. </li>
</ul> <p>This function may also return SQLITE_NOMEM. If it is called with the database handle in autocommit mode but fails for some other reason, whether or not a read transaction is opened on schema S is undefined.</p> <p>The <a href="snapshot.html">sqlite3_snapshot</a> object returned from a successful call to <a href="snapshot_get.html">sqlite3_snapshot_get()</a> must be freed using <a href="snapshot_free.html">sqlite3_snapshot_free()</a> to avoid a memory leak.</p> <p>The <a href="snapshot_get.html">sqlite3_snapshot_get()</a> interface is only available when the <a href="../compile.html#enable_snapshot">SQLITE_ENABLE_SNAPSHOT</a> compile-time option is used. </p>
