</pre> <p> The xDeviceCharacteristics method of the <a href="io_methods.html">sqlite3_io_methods</a> object returns an integer which is a vector of these bit values expressing I/O characteristics of the mass storage device that holds the file that the <a href="io_methods.html">sqlite3_io_methods</a> refers to.</p> <p>The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of any size are atomic. The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of nnn are atomic. The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended first then the size of the file is extended, never the other way around. The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that information is written to disk in the same order as calls to xWrite(). The SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE property means that after reboot following a crash or power loss, the only bytes in a file that were written at the application level might have changed and that adjacent bytes, even bytes within the same sector are guaranteed to be unchanged. The SQLITE_IOCAP_UNDELETABLE_WHEN_OPEN flag indicates that a file cannot be deleted when open. The SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE flag indicates that the file is on read-only media and cannot be changed even by processes with elevated privileges.</p> <p>The SQLITE_IOCAP_BATCH_ATOMIC property means that the underlying filesystem supports doing multiple write operations atomically when those write operations are bracketed by <a href="c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlbeginatomicwrite">SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE</a> and <a href="c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlcommitatomicwrite">SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE</a>. </p>
