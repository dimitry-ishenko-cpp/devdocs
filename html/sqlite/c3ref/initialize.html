      <h1>Initialize The SQLite Library</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
int sqlite3_initialize(void);
int sqlite3_shutdown(void);
int sqlite3_os_init(void);
int sqlite3_os_end(void);
</pre> <p> The sqlite3_initialize() routine initializes the SQLite library. The sqlite3_shutdown() routine deallocates any resources that were allocated by sqlite3_initialize(). These routines are designed to aid in process initialization and shutdown on embedded systems. Workstation applications using SQLite normally do not need to invoke either of these routines.</p> <p>A call to sqlite3_initialize() is an "effective" call if it is the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked during the lifetime of the process, or if it is the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked following a call to sqlite3_shutdown(). Only an effective call of sqlite3_initialize() does any initialization. All other calls are harmless no-ops.</p> <p>A call to sqlite3_shutdown() is an "effective" call if it is the first call to sqlite3_shutdown() since the last sqlite3_initialize(). Only an effective call to sqlite3_shutdown() does any deinitialization. All other valid calls to sqlite3_shutdown() are harmless no-ops.</p> <p>The sqlite3_initialize() interface is threadsafe, but sqlite3_shutdown() is not. The sqlite3_shutdown() interface must only be called from a single thread. All open <a href="sqlite3.html">database connections</a> must be closed and all other SQLite resources must be deallocated prior to invoking sqlite3_shutdown().</p> <p>Among other things, sqlite3_initialize() will invoke sqlite3_os_init(). Similarly, sqlite3_shutdown() will invoke sqlite3_os_end().</p> <p>The sqlite3_initialize() routine returns <a href="../rescode.html#ok">SQLITE_OK</a> on success. If for some reason, sqlite3_initialize() is unable to initialize the library (perhaps it is unable to allocate a needed resource such as a mutex) it returns an <a href="../rescode.html">error code</a> other than <a href="../rescode.html#ok">SQLITE_OK</a>.</p> <p>The sqlite3_initialize() routine is called internally by many other SQLite interfaces so that an application usually does not need to invoke sqlite3_initialize() directly. For example, <a href="open.html">sqlite3_open()</a> calls sqlite3_initialize() so the SQLite library will be automatically initialized when <a href="open.html">sqlite3_open()</a> is called if it has not be initialized already. However, if SQLite is compiled with the <a href="../compile.html#omit_autoinit">SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT</a> compile-time option, then the automatic calls to sqlite3_initialize() are omitted and the application must call sqlite3_initialize() directly prior to using any other SQLite interface. For maximum portability, it is recommended that applications always invoke sqlite3_initialize() directly prior to using any other SQLite interface. Future releases of SQLite may require this. In other words, the behavior exhibited when SQLite is compiled with <a href="../compile.html#omit_autoinit">SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT</a> might become the default behavior in some future release of SQLite.</p> <p>The sqlite3_os_init() routine does operating-system specific initialization of the SQLite library. The sqlite3_os_end() routine undoes the effect of sqlite3_os_init(). Typical tasks performed by these routines include allocation or deallocation of static resources, initialization of global variables, setting up a default <a href="vfs.html">sqlite3_vfs</a> module, or setting up a default configuration using <a href="config.html">sqlite3_config()</a>.</p> <p>The application should never invoke either sqlite3_os_init() or sqlite3_os_end() directly. The application should only invoke sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown(). The sqlite3_os_init() interface is called automatically by sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_os_end() is called by sqlite3_shutdown(). Appropriate implementations for sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end() are built into SQLite when it is compiled for Unix, Windows, or OS/2. When <a href="../custombuild.html">built for other platforms</a> (using the <a href="../compile.html#os_other">SQLITE_OS_OTHER=1</a> compile-time option) the application must supply a suitable implementation for sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end(). An application-supplied implementation of sqlite3_os_init() or sqlite3_os_end() must return <a href="../rescode.html#ok">SQLITE_OK</a> on success and some other <a href="../rescode.html">error code</a> upon failure. </p>
