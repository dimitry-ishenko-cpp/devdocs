</pre> <p> These interfaces return information about the predicted and measured performance for pStmt. Advanced applications can use this interface to compare the predicted and the measured performance and issue warnings and/or rerun <a href="../lang_analyze.html">ANALYZE</a> if discrepancies are found.</p> <p>Since this interface is expected to be rarely used, it is only available if SQLite is compiled using the <a href="../compile.html#enable_stmt_scanstatus">SQLITE_ENABLE_STMT_SCANSTATUS</a> compile-time option.</p> <p>The "iScanStatusOp" parameter determines which status information to return. The "iScanStatusOp" must be one of the <a href="c_scanstat_est.html">scanstatus options</a> or the behavior of this interface is undefined. The requested measurement is written into a variable pointed to by the "pOut" parameter.</p> <p>The "flags" parameter must be passed a mask of flags. At present only one flag is defined - SQLITE_SCANSTAT_COMPLEX. If SQLITE_SCANSTAT_COMPLEX is specified, then status information is available for all elements of a query plan that are reported by "EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN" output. If SQLITE_SCANSTAT_COMPLEX is not specified, then only query plan elements that correspond to query loops (the "SCAN..." and "SEARCH..." elements of the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN output) are available. Invoking API sqlite3_stmt_scanstatus() is equivalent to calling sqlite3_stmt_scanstatus_v2() with a zeroed flags parameter.</p> <p>Parameter "idx" identifies the specific query element to retrieve statistics for. Query elements are numbered starting from zero. A value of -1 may be to query for statistics regarding the entire query. If idx is out of range - less than -1 or greater than or equal to the total number of query elements used to implement the statement - a non-zero value is returned and the variable that pOut points to is unchanged.</p> <p>See also: <a href="stmt_scanstatus_reset.html">sqlite3_stmt_scanstatus_reset()</a> </p>
