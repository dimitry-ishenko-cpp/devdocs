</pre> <p> These constants identify classes of events that can be monitored using the <a href="trace_v2.html">sqlite3_trace_v2()</a> tracing logic. The M argument to <a href="trace_v2.html">sqlite3_trace_v2(D,M,X,P)</a> is an OR-ed combination of one or more of the following constants. The first argument to the trace callback is one of the following constants.</p> <p>New tracing constants may be added in future releases.</p> <p>A trace callback has four arguments: xCallback(T,C,P,X). The T argument is one of the integer type codes above. The C argument is a copy of the context pointer passed in as the fourth argument to <a href="trace_v2.html">sqlite3_trace_v2()</a>. The P and X arguments are pointers whose meanings depend on T.</p> <p></p>
<dl>  <dt id="sqlitetracestmt">SQLITE_TRACE_STMT</dt> <dd>An SQLITE_TRACE_STMT callback is invoked when a prepared statement first begins running and possibly at other times during the execution of the prepared statement, such as at the start of each trigger subprogram. The P argument is a pointer to the <a href="stmt.html">prepared statement</a>. The X argument is a pointer to a string which is the unexpanded SQL text of the prepared statement or an SQL comment that indicates the invocation of a trigger. The callback can compute the same text that would have been returned by the legacy <a href="profile.html">sqlite3_trace()</a> interface by using the X argument when X begins with "--" and invoking <a href="expanded_sql.html">sqlite3_expanded_sql(P)</a> otherwise. <p> </p>

</dd>
<dt>SQLITE_TRACE_PROFILE</dt> <dd>An SQLITE_TRACE_PROFILE callback provides approximately the same information as is provided by the <a href="profile.html">sqlite3_profile()</a> callback. The P argument is a pointer to the <a href="stmt.html">prepared statement</a> and the X argument points to a 64-bit integer which is approximately the number of nanoseconds that the prepared statement took to run. The SQLITE_TRACE_PROFILE callback is invoked when the statement finishes. <p> </p>
<a name="sqlitetracerow" id="sqlitetracerow"></a>
</dd>
<dt>SQLITE_TRACE_ROW</dt> <dd>An SQLITE_TRACE_ROW callback is invoked whenever a prepared statement generates a single row of result. The P argument is a pointer to the <a href="stmt.html">prepared statement</a> and the X argument is unused. <p> </p>
<a name="sqlitetraceclose" id="sqlitetraceclose"></a>
</dd>
<dt>SQLITE_TRACE_CLOSE</dt> <dd>An SQLITE_TRACE_CLOSE callback is invoked when a database connection closes. The P argument is a pointer to the <a href="sqlite3.html">database connection</a> object and the X argument is unused. </dd>
