</pre> <p> If a <a href="../wal.html#walfile">WAL file</a> remains on disk after all database connections close (either through the use of the <a href="c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlpersistwal">SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL</a> <a href="file_control.html">file control</a> or because the last process to have the database opened exited without calling <a href="close.html">sqlite3_close()</a>) and a new connection is subsequently opened on that database and <a href="../wal.html#walfile">WAL file</a>, the <a href="snapshot_open.html">sqlite3_snapshot_open()</a> interface will only be able to open the last transaction added to the WAL file even though the WAL file contains other valid transactions.</p> <p>This function attempts to scan the WAL file associated with database zDb of database handle db and make all valid snapshots available to sqlite3_snapshot_open(). It is an error if there is already a read transaction open on the database, or if the database is not a WAL mode database.</p> <p>SQLITE_OK is returned if successful, or an SQLite error code otherwise.</p> <p>This interface is only available if SQLite is compiled with the <a href="../compile.html#enable_snapshot">SQLITE_ENABLE_SNAPSHOT</a> option. </p>
