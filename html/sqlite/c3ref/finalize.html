      <h1>Destroy A Prepared Statement Object</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
int sqlite3_finalize(sqlite3_stmt *pStmt);
</pre> <p> The sqlite3_finalize() function is called to delete a <a href="stmt.html">prepared statement</a>. If the most recent evaluation of the statement encountered no errors or if the statement is never been evaluated, then sqlite3_finalize() returns SQLITE_OK. If the most recent evaluation of statement S failed, then sqlite3_finalize(S) returns the appropriate <a href="../rescode.html">error code</a> or <a href="../rescode.html#extrc">extended error code</a>.</p> <p>The sqlite3_finalize(S) routine can be called at any point during the life cycle of <a href="stmt.html">prepared statement</a> S: before statement S is ever evaluated, after one or more calls to <a href="reset.html">sqlite3_reset()</a>, or after any call to <a href="step.html">sqlite3_step()</a> regardless of whether or not the statement has completed execution.</p> <p>Invoking sqlite3_finalize() on a NULL pointer is a harmless no-op.</p> <p>The application must finalize every <a href="stmt.html">prepared statement</a> in order to avoid resource leaks. It is a grievous error for the application to try to use a prepared statement after it has been finalized. Any use of a prepared statement after it has been finalized can result in undefined and undesirable behavior such as segfaults and heap corruption. </p>
