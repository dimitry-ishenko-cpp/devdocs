      <h1>Return The Size Of An Open BLOB</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
int sqlite3_blob_bytes(sqlite3_blob *);
</pre> <p> Returns the size in bytes of the BLOB accessible via the successfully opened <a href="blob.html">BLOB handle</a> in its only argument. The incremental blob I/O routines can only read or overwriting existing blob content; they cannot change the size of a blob.</p> <p>This routine only works on a <a href="blob.html">BLOB handle</a> which has been created by a prior successful call to <a href="blob_open.html">sqlite3_blob_open()</a> and which has not been closed by <a href="blob_close.html">sqlite3_blob_close()</a>. Passing any other pointer in to this routine results in undefined and probably undesirable behavior. </p>
