</pre> <p> This is a legacy interface that is preserved for backwards compatibility. Use of this interface is not recommended.</p> <p>Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the <a href="free_table.html">sqlite3_get_table()</a> interface. A result table records the complete query results from one or more queries.</p> <p>The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns. But these numbers are not part of the result table itself. These numbers are obtained separately. Let N be the number of rows and M be the number of columns.</p> <p>A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated UTF-8 strings. There are (N+1)*M elements in the array. The first M pointers point to zero-terminated strings that contain the names of the columns. The remaining entries all point to query results. NULL values result in NULL pointers. All other values are in their UTF-8 zero-terminated string representation as returned by <a href="column_blob.html">sqlite3_column_text()</a>.</p> <p>A result table might consist of one or more memory allocations. It is not safe to pass a result table directly to <a href="free.html">sqlite3_free()</a>. A result table should be deallocated using <a href="free_table.html">sqlite3_free_table()</a>.</p> <p>As an example of the result table format, suppose a query result is as follows:</p> <p></p>
<pre data-language="sql">
Name        | Age
-----------------------
Alice       | 43
Bob         | 28
Cindy       | 21
</pre> <p>There are two columns (M==2) and three rows (N==3). Thus the result table has 8 entries. Suppose the result table is stored in an array named azResult. Then azResult holds this content:</p> <p></p>
<pre data-language="sql">
azResult[0] = "Name";
azResult[1] = "Age";
azResult[2] = "Alice";
azResult[3] = "43";
azResult[4] = "Bob";
azResult[5] = "28";
azResult[6] = "Cindy";
azResult[7] = "21";
</pre> <p>The sqlite3_get_table() function evaluates one or more semicolon-separated SQL statements in the zero-terminated UTF-8 string of its 2nd parameter and returns a result table to the pointer given in its 3rd parameter.</p> <p>After the application has finished with the result from sqlite3_get_table(), it must pass the result table pointer to sqlite3_free_table() in order to release the memory that was malloced. Because of the way the <a href="free.html">sqlite3_malloc()</a> happens within sqlite3_get_table(), the calling function must not try to call <a href="free.html">sqlite3_free()</a> directly. Only <a href="free_table.html">sqlite3_free_table()</a> is able to release the memory properly and safely.</p> <p>The sqlite3_get_table() interface is implemented as a wrapper around <a href="exec.html">sqlite3_exec()</a>. The sqlite3_get_table() routine does not have access to any internal data structures of SQLite. It uses only the public interface defined here. As a consequence, errors that occur in the wrapper layer outside of the internal <a href="exec.html">sqlite3_exec()</a> call are not reflected in subsequent calls to <a href="errcode.html">sqlite3_errcode()</a> or <a href="errcode.html">sqlite3_errmsg()</a>. </p>
