</pre> <p> These integer constants define the various locking operations allowed by the xShmLock method of <a href="io_methods.html">sqlite3_io_methods</a>. The following are the only legal combinations of flags to the xShmLock method:</p> <p></p>
<ul> <li> SQLITE_SHM_LOCK | SQLITE_SHM_SHARED </li>
<li> SQLITE_SHM_LOCK | SQLITE_SHM_EXCLUSIVE </li>
<li> SQLITE_SHM_UNLOCK | SQLITE_SHM_SHARED </li>
<li> SQLITE_SHM_UNLOCK | SQLITE_SHM_EXCLUSIVE </li>
</ul> <p>When unlocking, the same SHARED or EXCLUSIVE flag must be supplied as was given on the corresponding lock.</p> <p>The xShmLock method can transition between unlocked and SHARED or between unlocked and EXCLUSIVE. It cannot transition between SHARED and EXCLUSIVE. </p>
