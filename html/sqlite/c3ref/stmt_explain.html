      <h1>Change The EXPLAIN Setting For A Prepared Statement</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
int sqlite3_stmt_explain(sqlite3_stmt *pStmt, int eMode);
</pre> <p> The sqlite3_stmt_explain(S,E) interface changes the EXPLAIN setting for <a href="stmt.html">prepared statement</a> S. If E is zero, then S becomes a normal prepared statement. If E is 1, then S behaves as if its SQL text began with "<a href="../lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a>". If E is 2, then S behaves as if its SQL text began with "<a href="../eqp.html">EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN</a>".</p> <p>Calling sqlite3_stmt_explain(S,E) might cause S to be reprepared. SQLite tries to avoid a reprepare, but a reprepare might be necessary on the first transition into EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN mode.</p> <p>Because of the potential need to reprepare, a call to sqlite3_stmt_explain(S,E) will fail with SQLITE_ERROR if S cannot be reprepared because it was created using <a href="prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> instead of the newer <a href="prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare_v2()</a> or <a href="prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare_v3()</a> interfaces and hence has no saved SQL text with which to reprepare.</p> <p>Changing the explain setting for a prepared statement does not change the original SQL text for the statement. Hence, if the SQL text originally began with EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN, but sqlite3_stmt_explain(S,0) is called to convert the statement into an ordinary statement, the EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN keywords will still appear in the sqlite3_sql(S) output, even though the statement now acts like a normal SQL statement.</p> <p>This routine returns SQLITE_OK if the explain mode is successfully changed, or an error code if the explain mode could not be changed. The explain mode cannot be changed while a statement is active. Hence, it is good practice to call <a href="reset.html">sqlite3_reset(S)</a> immediately prior to calling sqlite3_stmt_explain(S,E). </p>
