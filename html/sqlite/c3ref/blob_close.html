      <h1>Close A BLOB Handle</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
int sqlite3_blob_close(sqlite3_blob *);
</pre> <p> This function closes an open <a href="blob.html">BLOB handle</a>. The BLOB handle is closed unconditionally. Even if this routine returns an error code, the handle is still closed.</p> <p>If the blob handle being closed was opened for read-write access, and if the database is in auto-commit mode and there are no other open read-write blob handles or active write statements, the current transaction is committed. If an error occurs while committing the transaction, an error code is returned and the transaction rolled back.</p> <p>Calling this function with an argument that is not a NULL pointer or an open blob handle results in undefined behavior. Calling this routine with a null pointer (such as would be returned by a failed call to <a href="blob_open.html">sqlite3_blob_open()</a>) is a harmless no-op. Otherwise, if this function is passed a valid open blob handle, the values returned by the sqlite3_errcode() and sqlite3_errmsg() functions are set before returning. </p>
