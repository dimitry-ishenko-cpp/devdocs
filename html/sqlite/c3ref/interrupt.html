      <h1>Interrupt A Long-Running Query</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
void sqlite3_interrupt(sqlite3*);
int sqlite3_is_interrupted(sqlite3*);
</pre> <p> This function causes any pending database operation to abort and return at its earliest opportunity. This routine is typically called in response to a user action such as pressing "Cancel" or Ctrl-C where the user wants a long query operation to halt immediately.</p> <p>It is safe to call this routine from a thread different from the thread that is currently running the database operation. But it is not safe to call this routine with a <a href="sqlite3.html">database connection</a> that is closed or might close before sqlite3_interrupt() returns.</p> <p>If an SQL operation is very nearly finished at the time when sqlite3_interrupt() is called, then it might not have an opportunity to be interrupted and might continue to completion.</p> <p>An SQL operation that is interrupted will return <a href="../rescode.html#interrupt">SQLITE_INTERRUPT</a>. If the interrupted SQL operation is an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE that is inside an explicit transaction, then the entire transaction will be rolled back automatically.</p> <p>The sqlite3_interrupt(D) call is in effect until all currently running SQL statements on <a href="sqlite3.html">database connection</a> D complete. Any new SQL statements that are started after the sqlite3_interrupt() call and before the running statement count reaches zero are interrupted as if they had been running prior to the sqlite3_interrupt() call. New SQL statements that are started after the running statement count reaches zero are not effected by the sqlite3_interrupt(). A call to sqlite3_interrupt(D) that occurs when there are no running SQL statements is a no-op and has no effect on SQL statements that are started after the sqlite3_interrupt() call returns.</p> <p>The <a href="interrupt.html">sqlite3_is_interrupted(D)</a> interface can be used to determine whether or not an interrupt is currently in effect for <a href="sqlite3.html">database connection</a> D. It returns 1 if an interrupt is currently in effect, or 0 otherwise. </p>
