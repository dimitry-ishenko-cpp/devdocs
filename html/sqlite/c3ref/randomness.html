      <h1>Pseudo-Random Number Generator</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
void sqlite3_randomness(int N, void *P);
</pre> <p> SQLite contains a high-quality pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to select random <a href="../lang_createtable.html#rowid">ROWIDs</a> when inserting new records into a table that already uses the largest possible <a href="../lang_createtable.html#rowid">ROWID</a>. The PRNG is also used for the built-in random() and randomblob() SQL functions. This interface allows applications to access the same PRNG for other purposes.</p> <p>A call to this routine stores N bytes of randomness into buffer P. The P parameter can be a NULL pointer.</p> <p>If this routine has not been previously called or if the previous call had N less than one or a NULL pointer for P, then the PRNG is seeded using randomness obtained from the xRandomness method of the default <a href="vfs.html">sqlite3_vfs</a> object. If the previous call to this routine had an N of 1 or more and a non-NULL P then the pseudo-randomness is generated internally and without recourse to the <a href="vfs.html">sqlite3_vfs</a> xRandomness method. </p>
