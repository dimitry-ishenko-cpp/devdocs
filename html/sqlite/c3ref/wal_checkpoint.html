      <h1>Checkpoint a database</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
int sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(sqlite3 *db, const char *zDb);
</pre> <p> The sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(D,X) is equivalent to <a href="wal_checkpoint_v2.html">sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2</a>(D,X,<a href="c_checkpoint_full.html">SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_PASSIVE</a>,0,0).</p> <p>In brief, sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(D,X) causes the content in the <a href="../wal.html">write-ahead log</a> for database X on <a href="sqlite3.html">database connection</a> D to be transferred into the database file and for the write-ahead log to be reset. See the <a href="../wal.html#ckpt">checkpointing</a> documentation for addition information.</p> <p>This interface used to be the only way to cause a checkpoint to occur. But then the newer and more powerful <a href="wal_checkpoint_v2.html">sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2()</a> interface was added. This interface is retained for backwards compatibility and as a convenience for applications that need to manually start a callback but which do not need the full power (and corresponding complication) of <a href="wal_checkpoint_v2.html">sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2()</a>. </p>
