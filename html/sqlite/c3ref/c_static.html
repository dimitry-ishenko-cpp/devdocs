      <h1>Constants Defining Special Destructor Behavior</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
typedef void (*sqlite3_destructor_type)(void*);
#define SQLITE_STATIC      ((sqlite3_destructor_type)0)
#define SQLITE_TRANSIENT   ((sqlite3_destructor_type)-1)
</pre> <p> These are special values for the destructor that is passed in as the final argument to routines like <a href="result_blob.html">sqlite3_result_blob()</a>. If the destructor argument is SQLITE_STATIC, it means that the content pointer is constant and will never change. It does not need to be destroyed. The SQLITE_TRANSIENT value means that the content will likely change in the near future and that SQLite should make its own private copy of the content before returning.</p> <p>The typedef is necessary to work around problems in certain C++ compilers. </p>
