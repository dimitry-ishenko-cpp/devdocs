</pre> <p> The sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) interface causes the <a href="sqlite3.html">database connection</a> D to disconnect from database S and then reopen S as an in-memory database based on the serialization contained in P. The serialized database P is N bytes in size. M is the size of the buffer P, which might be larger than N. If M is larger than N, and the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_READONLY bit is not set in F, then SQLite is permitted to add content to the in-memory database as long as the total size does not exceed M bytes.</p> <p>If the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE bit is set in F, then SQLite will invoke sqlite3_free() on the serialization buffer when the database connection closes. If the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_RESIZEABLE bit is set, then SQLite will try to increase the buffer size using sqlite3_realloc64() if writes on the database cause it to grow larger than M bytes.</p> <p>Applications must not modify the buffer P or invalidate it before the database connection D is closed.</p> <p>The sqlite3_deserialize() interface will fail with SQLITE_BUSY if the database is currently in a read transaction or is involved in a backup operation.</p> <p>It is not possible to deserialized into the TEMP database. If the S argument to sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) is "temp" then the function returns SQLITE_ERROR.</p> <p>The deserialized database should not be in <a href="../wal.html">WAL mode</a>. If the database is in WAL mode, then any attempt to use the database file will result in an <a href="../rescode.html#cantopen">SQLITE_CANTOPEN</a> error. The application can set the <a href="../fileformat2.html#vnums">file format version numbers</a> (bytes 18 and 19) of the input database P to 0x01 prior to invoking sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) to force the database file into rollback mode and work around this limitation.</p> <p>If sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) fails for any reason and if the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE bit is set in argument F, then <a href="free.html">sqlite3_free()</a> is invoked on argument P prior to returning.</p> <p>This interface is omitted if SQLite is compiled with the <a href="../compile.html#omit_deserialize">SQLITE_OMIT_DESERIALIZE</a> option. </p>
