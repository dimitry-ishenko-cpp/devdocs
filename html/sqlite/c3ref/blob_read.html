      <h1>Read Data From A BLOB Incrementally</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
int sqlite3_blob_read(sqlite3_blob *, void *Z, int N, int iOffset);
</pre> <p> This function is used to read data from an open <a href="blob.html">BLOB handle</a> into a caller-supplied buffer. N bytes of data are copied into buffer Z from the open BLOB, starting at offset iOffset.</p> <p>If offset iOffset is less than N bytes from the end of the BLOB, <a href="../rescode.html#error">SQLITE_ERROR</a> is returned and no data is read. If N or iOffset is less than zero, <a href="../rescode.html#error">SQLITE_ERROR</a> is returned and no data is read. The size of the blob (and hence the maximum value of N+iOffset) can be determined using the <a href="blob_bytes.html">sqlite3_blob_bytes()</a> interface.</p> <p>An attempt to read from an expired <a href="blob.html">BLOB handle</a> fails with an error code of <a href="../rescode.html#abort">SQLITE_ABORT</a>.</p> <p>On success, sqlite3_blob_read() returns SQLITE_OK. Otherwise, an <a href="../rescode.html">error code</a> or an <a href="../rescode.html#extrc">extended error code</a> is returned.</p> <p>This routine only works on a <a href="blob.html">BLOB handle</a> which has been created by a prior successful call to <a href="blob_open.html">sqlite3_blob_open()</a> and which has not been closed by <a href="blob_close.html">sqlite3_blob_close()</a>. Passing any other pointer in to this routine results in undefined and probably undesirable behavior.</p> <p>See also: <a href="blob_write.html">sqlite3_blob_write()</a>. </p>
