      <h1>Return The Schema Name For A Database Connection</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
const char *sqlite3_db_name(sqlite3 *db, int N);
</pre> <p> The sqlite3_db_name(D,N) interface returns a pointer to the schema name for the N-th database on database connection D, or a NULL pointer of N is out of range. An N value of 0 means the main database file. An N of 1 is the "temp" schema. Larger values of N correspond to various ATTACH-ed databases.</p> <p>Space to hold the string that is returned by sqlite3_db_name() is managed by SQLite itself. The string might be deallocated by any operation that changes the schema, including <a href="../lang_attach.html">ATTACH</a> or <a href="../lang_detach.html">DETACH</a> or calls to <a href="serialize.html">sqlite3_serialize()</a> or <a href="deserialize.html">sqlite3_deserialize()</a>, even operations that occur on a different thread. Applications that need to remember the string long-term should make their own copy. Applications that are accessing the same database connection simultaneously on multiple threads should mutex-protect calls to this API and should make their own private copy of the result prior to releasing the mutex. </p>
