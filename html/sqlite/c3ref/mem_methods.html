</pre> <p> An instance of this object defines the interface between SQLite and low-level memory allocation routines.</p> <p>This object is used in only one place in the SQLite interface. A pointer to an instance of this object is the argument to <a href="config.html">sqlite3_config()</a> when the configuration option is <a href="c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigmalloc">SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC</a> or <a href="c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfiggetmalloc">SQLITE_CONFIG_GETMALLOC</a>. By creating an instance of this object and passing it to <a href="config.html">sqlite3_config</a>(<a href="c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigmalloc">SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC</a>) during configuration, an application can specify an alternative memory allocation subsystem for SQLite to use for all of its dynamic memory needs.</p> <p>Note that SQLite comes with several <a href="../malloc.html#altalloc">built-in memory allocators</a> that are perfectly adequate for the overwhelming majority of applications and that this object is only useful to a tiny minority of applications with specialized memory allocation requirements. This object is also used during testing of SQLite in order to specify an alternative memory allocator that simulates memory out-of-memory conditions in order to verify that SQLite recovers gracefully from such conditions.</p> <p>The xMalloc, xRealloc, and xFree methods must work like the malloc(), realloc() and free() functions from the standard C library. SQLite guarantees that the second argument to xRealloc is always a value returned by a prior call to xRoundup.</p> <p>xSize should return the allocated size of a memory allocation previously obtained from xMalloc or xRealloc. The allocated size is always at least as big as the requested size but may be larger.</p> <p>The xRoundup method returns what would be the allocated size of a memory allocation given a particular requested size. Most memory allocators round up memory allocations at least to the next multiple of 8. Some allocators round up to a larger multiple or to a power of 2. Every memory allocation request coming in through <a href="free.html">sqlite3_malloc()</a> or <a href="free.html">sqlite3_realloc()</a> first calls xRoundup. If xRoundup returns 0, that causes the corresponding memory allocation to fail.</p> <p>The xInit method initializes the memory allocator. For example, it might allocate any required mutexes or initialize internal data structures. The xShutdown method is invoked (indirectly) by <a href="initialize.html">sqlite3_shutdown()</a> and should deallocate any resources acquired by xInit. The pAppData pointer is used as the only parameter to xInit and xShutdown.</p> <p>SQLite holds the <a href="c_mutex_fast.html">SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MAIN</a> mutex when it invokes the xInit method, so the xInit method need not be threadsafe. The xShutdown method is only called from <a href="initialize.html">sqlite3_shutdown()</a> so it does not need to be threadsafe either. For all other methods, SQLite holds the <a href="c_mutex_fast.html">SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM</a> mutex as long as the <a href="c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigmemstatus">SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS</a> configuration option is turned on (which it is by default) and so the methods are automatically serialized. However, if <a href="c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigmemstatus">SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS</a> is disabled, then the other methods must be threadsafe or else make their own arrangements for serialization.</p> <p>SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening call to xShutdown(). </p>
