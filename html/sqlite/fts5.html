<span>1. </span>Overview of FTS5</h1> <p>FTS5 is an SQLite <a href="c3ref/module.html">virtual table module</a> that provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_text_search">full-text search</a> functionality to database applications. In their most elementary form, full-text search engines allow the user to efficiently search a large collection of documents for the subset that contain one or more instances of a search term. The search functionality provided to world wide web users by <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> is, among other things, a full-text search engine, as it allows users to search for all documents on the web that contain, for example, the term "fts5". </p>
<p>To use FTS5, the user creates an FTS5 virtual table with one or more columns. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE email USING fts5(sender, title, body);
</pre> <p>It is an error to add types, constraints or <a href="lang_createtable.html#primkeyconst">PRIMARY KEY</a> declarations to a CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement used to create an FTS5 table. Once created, an FTS5 table may be populated using <a href="lang_insert.html">INSERT</a>, <a href="lang_update.html">UPDATE</a> or <a href="lang_delete.html">DELETE</a> statements like any other table. Like any other table with no PRIMARY KEY declaration, an FTS5 table has an implicit INTEGER PRIMARY KEY field named rowid. </p>
<p>Not shown in the example above is that there are also <a href="fts5.html#fts5_table_creation_and_initialization">various options</a> that may be provided to FTS5 as part of the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement to configure various aspects of the new table. These may be used to modify the way in which the FTS5 table extracts terms from documents and queries, to create extra indexes on disk to speed up prefix queries, or to create an FTS5 table that acts as an index on content stored elsewhere. </p>
<p>Once populated, there are three ways to execute a full-text query against the contents of an FTS5 table: </p>
<ul>
<li> Using a MATCH operator in the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement, or </li>
<li> Using an equals ("=") operator in the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement, or </li>
<li> using the <a href="vtab.html#tabfunc2">table-valued function</a> syntax. </li>
</ul> <p>If using the MATCH or = operators, the expression to the left of the MATCH operator is usually the name of the FTS5 table (the exception is when <a href="fts5.html#fts5_column_filters">specifying a column-filter</a>). The expression on the right must be a text value specifying the term to search for. For the table-valued function syntax, the term to search for is specified as the first table argument. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Query for all rows that contain at least once instance of the term
-- "fts5" (in any column). The following three queries are equivalent.
SELECT * FROM email WHERE email MATCH 'fts5';
SELECT * FROM email WHERE email = 'fts5';
SELECT * FROM email('fts5');
</pre> <p> By default, FTS5 full-text searches are case-independent. Like any other SQL query that does not contain an ORDER BY clause, the example above returns results in an arbitrary order. To sort results by relevance (most to least relevant), an ORDER BY may be added to a full-text query as follows: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Query for all rows that contain at least once instance of the term
-- "fts5" (in any column). Return results in order from best to worst
-- match.  
SELECT * FROM email WHERE email MATCH 'fts5' ORDER BY rank;
</pre> <p> As well as the column values and rowid of a matching row, an application may use <a href="fts5.html#_auxiliary_functions_">FTS5 auxiliary functions</a> to retrieve extra information regarding the matched row. For example, an auxiliary function may be used to retrieve a copy of a column value for a matched row with all instances of the matched term surrounded by html &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tags. Auxiliary functions are invoked in the same way as SQLite <a href="lang_corefunc.html">scalar functions</a>, except that the name of the FTS5 table is specified as the first argument. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Query for rows that match "fts5". Return a copy of the "body" column
-- of each row with the matches surrounded by &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tags.
SELECT highlight(email, 2, '&lt;b&gt;', '&lt;/b&gt;') FROM email('fts5');
</pre> <p>A description of the available auxiliary functions, and more details regarding configuration of the special "rank" column, are <a href="fts5.html#_auxiliary_functions_">available below</a>. <a href="fts5.html#custom_auxiliary_functions">Custom auxiliary functions</a> may also be implemented in C and registered with FTS5, just as custom SQL functions may be registered with the SQLite core. </p>
<p> As well as searching for all rows that contain a term, FTS5 allows the user to search for rows that contain: </p>
<ul> <li> any terms that begin with a specified prefix, </li>
<li> "phrases" - sequences of terms or prefix terms that must feature in a document for it to match the query, </li>
<li> sets of terms, prefix terms or phrases that appear within a specified proximity of each other (these are called "NEAR queries"), or </li>
<li> boolean combinations of any of the above. </li>
</ul> <p> Such advanced searches are requested by providing a more complicated FTS5 query string as the text to the right of the MATCH operator (or = operator, or as the first argument to a table-valued function syntax). The full query syntax is <a href="fts5.html#full_text_query_syntax">described here</a>. </p> <h1 tags="FTS5 building" id="compiling_and_using_fts5">
<span>2. </span>Compiling and Using FTS5</h1> <h2 id="building_fts5_as_part_of_sqlite">
<span>2.1. </span>Building FTS5 as part of SQLite</h2> <p>As of <a href="https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_9_0.html">version 3.9.0</a> (2015-10-14), FTS5 is included as part of the SQLite <a href="amalgamation.html">amalgamation</a>. If using one of the two autoconf build system, FTS5 is enabled by specifying the "--enable-fts5" option when running the configure script. (FTS5 is currently disabled by default for the source-tree configure script and enabled by default for the amalgamation configure script, but these defaults might change in the future.) </p>
<p>Or, if sqlite3.c is compiled using some other build system, by arranging for the SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5 pre-processor symbol to be defined. </p>
<h2 id="building_a_loadable_extension">
<span>2.2. </span>Building a Loadable Extension</h2> <p>Alternatively, FTS5 may be built as a loadable extension. </p>
<p>The canonical FTS5 source code consists of a series of *.c and other files in the "ext/fts5" directory of the SQLite source tree. A build process reduces this to just two files - "fts5.c" and "fts5.h" - which may be used to build an SQLite loadable extension. </p>
<ol> <li> Obtain the latest SQLite code from fossil. </li>
<li> Create a Makefile as described in <a href="howtocompile.html">How To Compile SQLite</a>. </li>
<li> Build the "fts5.c" target. Which also creates fts5.h. </li>
</ol> <pre data-language="sql">$ wget -c https://www.sqlite.org/src/tarball/SQLite-trunk.tgz?uuid=trunk -O SQLite-trunk.tgz
.... output ...
$ tar -xzf SQLite-trunk.tgz
$ cd SQLite-trunk
$ ./configure &amp;&amp; make fts5.c
... lots of output ...
$ ls fts5.[ch]
fts5.c        fts5.h
</pre> <p> The code in "fts5.c" may then be compiled into a loadable extension or statically linked into an application as described in <a href="loadext.html#build">Compiling Loadable Extensions</a>. There are two entry points defined, both of which do the same thing: </p>
<ul> <li> sqlite3_fts_init </li>
<li> sqlite3_fts5_init </li>
</ul> <p> The other file, "fts5.h", is not required to compile the FTS5 extension. It is used by applications that implement <a href="fts5.html#extending_fts5">custom FTS5 tokenizers or auxiliary functions</a>. </p> <h1 tags="FTS5 query syntax" id="full_text_query_syntax">

</pre>  <h2 tags="FTS5 Strings" id="fts5_strings">
<span>3.1. </span>FTS5 Strings</h2> <p id="fts5_strings"> Within an FTS expression a <b>string</b> may be specified in one of two ways: </p>
<ul> <li> <p>By enclosing it in double quotes ("). Within a string, any embedded double quote characters may be escaped SQL-style - by adding a second double-quote character. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>As an FTS5 bareword that is not "AND", "OR" or "NOT" (case sensitive). An FTS5 bareword is a string of one or more consecutive characters that are all either: </p>
<ul> <li> Non-ASCII range characters (i.e. unicode codepoints greater than 127), or </li>
<li> One of the 52 upper and lower case ASCII characters, or </li>
<li> One of the 10 decimal digit ASCII characters, or </li>
<li> The underscore character (unicode codepoint 96). </li>
<li> The substitute character (unicode codepoint 26). </li>
</ul> Strings that include any other characters must be quoted. Characters that are not currently allowed in barewords, are not quote characters and do not currently serve any special purpose in FTS5 query expressions may at some point in the future be allowed in barewords or used to implement new query functionality. This means that queries that are currently syntax errors because they include such a character outside of a quoted string may be interpreted differently by some future version of FTS5. </li>
</ul>  <h2 tags="FTS5 Phrases" id="fts5_phrases">
<span>3.2. </span>FTS5 Phrases</h2> <p id="fts5_phrases"> Each string in an fts5 query is parsed ("tokenized") by the <a href="fts5.html#tokenizers">tokenizer</a> and a list of zero or more <b>tokens</b>, or terms, extracted. For example, the default tokenizer tokenizes the string "alpha beta gamma" to three separate tokens - "alpha", "beta" and "gamma" - in that order. </p>
<p> FTS queries are made up of <b>phrases</b>. A phrase is an ordered list of one or more tokens. The tokens from each string in the query each make up a single phrase. Two phrases can be concatenated into a single large phrase using the "+" operator. For example, assuming the tokenizer module being used tokenizes the input "one.two.three" to three separate tokens, the following four queries all specify the same phrase: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">... MATCH '"one two three"'
... MATCH 'one + two + three'
... MATCH '"one two" + three'
... MATCH 'one.two.three'
</pre> <p> A phrase matches a document if the document contains at least one sub-sequence of tokens that matches the sequence of tokens that make up the phrase. </p> <h2 tags="FTS5 prefix queries" id="fts5_prefix_queries">
<span>3.3. </span>FTS5 Prefix Queries</h2> <p id="fts5_prefix_queries"> If a "*" character follows a string within an FTS expression, then the final token extracted from the string is marked as a <b>prefix token</b>. As you might expect, a prefix token matches any document token of which it is a prefix. For example, the first two queries in the following block will match any document that contains the token "one" immediately followed by the token "two" and then any token that begins with "thr". </p>
<pre data-language="sql">... MATCH '"one two thr" * '
... MATCH 'one + two + thr*'
... MATCH '"one two thr*"'      -- May not work as expected!
</pre> <p>The final query in the block above may not work as expected. Because the "*" character is inside the double-quotes, it will be passed to the tokenizer, which will likely discard it (or perhaps, depending on the specific tokenizer in use, include it as part of the final token) instead of recognizing it as a special FTS character.  </p>
<a name="carrotq" id="carrotq"></a> <h2 tags="FTS5 initial token queries" id="fts5_initial_token_queries">
<span>3.4. </span>FTS5 Initial Token Queries</h2> <p id="fts5_initial_token_queries"> If a "^" character appears immediately before a phrase that is not part of a NEAR query, then that phrase only matches a document only if it starts at the first token in a column. The "^" syntax may be combined with a <a href="fts5.html#fts5_column_filters">column filter</a>, but may not be inserted into the middle of a phrase. </p>
<pre data-language="sql">... MATCH '^one'              -- first token in any column must be "one"
... MATCH '^ one + two'       -- phrase "one two" must appear at start of a column
... MATCH '^ "one two"'       -- same as previous 
... MATCH 'a : ^two'          -- first token of column "a" must be "two"
... MATCH 'NEAR(^one, two)'   -- syntax error! 
... MATCH 'one + ^two'        -- syntax error! 
... MATCH '"^one two"'        -- May not work as expected!
</pre>  <h2 tags="FTS5 NEAR queries" id="fts5_near_queries">
<span>3.5. </span>FTS5 NEAR Queries</h2> <p id="fts5_near_queries">Two or more phrases may be grouped into a <b>NEAR group</b>. A NEAR group is specified by the token "NEAR" (case sensitive) followed by an open parenthesis character, followed by two or more whitespace separated phrases, optionally followed by a comma and the numeric parameter <i>N</i>, followed by a close parenthesis. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">... MATCH 'NEAR("one two" "three four", 10)'
... MATCH 'NEAR("one two" thr* + four)'
</pre> <p>If no <i>N</i> parameter is supplied, it defaults to 10. A NEAR group matches a document if the document contains at least one clump of tokens that: </p>
<ol> <li> contains at least one instance of each phrase, and </li>
<li> for which the number of tokens between the end of the first phrase and the beginning of the last phrase in the clump is less than or equal to <i>N</i>. </li>
</ol> <p>For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE f USING fts5(x);
INSERT INTO f(rowid, x) VALUES(1, 'A B C D x x x E F x');

... MATCH 'NEAR(e d, 4)';                      -- Matches!
... MATCH 'NEAR(e d, 3)';                      -- Matches!
... MATCH 'NEAR(e d, 2)';                      -- Does not match!

... MATCH 'NEAR("c d" "e f", 3)';              -- Matches!
... MATCH 'NEAR("c"   "e f", 3)';              -- Does not match!

... MATCH 'NEAR(a d e, 6)';                    -- Matches!
... MATCH 'NEAR(a d e, 5)';                    -- Does not match!

... MATCH 'NEAR("a b c d" "b c" "e f", 4)';    -- Matches!
... MATCH 'NEAR("a b c d" "b c" "e f", 3)';    -- Does not match!
</pre>  <h2 tags="FTS5 column filters" id="fts5_column_filters">
<span>3.6. </span>FTS5 Column Filters</h2> <p id="fts5_column_filters"> A single phrase or NEAR group may be restricted to matching text within a specified column of the FTS table by prefixing it with the column name followed by a colon character. Or to a set of columns by prefixing it with a whitespace separated list of column names enclosed in parenthesis ("curly brackets") followed by a colon character. Column names may be specified using either of the two forms described for strings above. Unlike strings that are part of phrases, column names are not passed to the tokenizer module. Column names are case-insensitive in the usual way for SQLite column names - upper/lower case equivalence is understood for ASCII-range characters only. </p>
<pre data-language="sql">... MATCH 'colname : NEAR("one two" "three four", 10)'
... MATCH '"colname" : one + two + three'

... MATCH '{col1 col2} : NEAR("one two" "three four", 10)'
... MATCH '{col2 col1 col3} : one + two + three'
</pre> <p> If a column filter specification is preceded by a "-" character, then it is interpreted as a list of column not to match against. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Search for matches in all columns except "colname"
... MATCH '- colname : NEAR("one two" "three four", 10)'

-- Search for matches in all columns except "col1", "col2" and "col3"
... MATCH '- {col2 col1 col3} : one + two + three'
</pre> <p> Column filter specifications may also be applied to arbitrary expressions enclosed in parenthesis. In this case the column filter applies to all phrases within the expression. Nested column filter operations may only further restrict the subset of columns matched, they can not be used to re-enable filtered columns. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- The following are equivalent:
... MATCH '{a b} : ( {b c} : "hello" AND "world" )'
... MATCH '(b : "hello") AND ({a b} : "world")'
</pre> <p> Finally, a column filter for a single column may be specified by using the column name as the LHS of a MATCH operator (instead of the usual table name). For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Given the following table
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a, b, c);

-- The following are equivalent
SELECT * FROM ft WHERE b MATCH 'uvw AND xyz';
SELECT * FROM ft WHERE ft MATCH 'b : (uvw AND xyz)';

-- This query cannot match any rows (since all columns are filtered out): 
SELECT * FROM ft WHERE b MATCH 'a : xyz';

<p>The first string or bareword in a column declaration is the column name. It is an error to attempt to name an fts5 table column "rowid" or "rank", or to assign the same name to a column as is used by the table itself. This is not supported. </p>
<p>Each subsequent string or bareword in a column declaration is a column option that modifies the behaviour of that column. Column options are case-independent.

For example, to query for the prefix token "abc*" requires a range scan of all tokens greater than or equal to "abc" and less than "abd". </p>
<p> A prefix index is a separate index that records the location of all instances of prefix tokens of a certain length in characters used to speed up queries for prefix tokens. For example, optimizing a query for prefix token "abc*" requires a prefix index of three-character prefixes. </p>
<p> To add prefix indexes to an FTS5 table, the "prefix" option is set to either a single positive integer or a text value containing a white-space separated list of one or more positive integer values.

<ul> <li> The <b>unicode61</b> tokenizer, based on the Unicode 6.1 standard. This is the default. </li>
<li> The <b>ascii</b> tokenizer, which assumes all characters outside of the ASCII codepoint range (0-127) are to be treated as token characters. </li>
<li> The <b>porter</b> tokenizer, which implements the <a href="https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer">porter stemming algorithm</a>. </li>
</ul> <p> It is also possible to create custom tokenizers for FTS5. The API for doing so is <a href="fts5.html#custom_tokenizers">described here</a>. </p>
<h3 id="unicode61_tokenizer">
<span>4.3.1. </span>Unicode61 Tokenizer</h3> <p> The unicode tokenizer classifies all unicode characters as either "separator" or "token" characters. By default all space and punctuation characters, as defined by Unicode 6.1, are considered separators, and all other characters as token characters. More specifically, all unicode characters assigned to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property#General_Category"> general category</a> beginning with "L" or "N" (letters and numbers, specifically) or to category "Co" ("other, private use") are considered tokens. All other characters are separators. </p>
<p>Each contiguous run of one or more token characters is considered to be a token. The tokenizer is case-insensitive according to the rules defined by Unicode 6.1. </p>
<p> By default, diacritics are removed from all Latin script characters. This means, for example, that "A", "a", "À", "à", "Â" and "â" are all considered to be equivalent. </p>
<p> Any arguments following "unicode61" in the token specification are treated as a list of alternating option names and values. Unicode61 supports the following options: </p>
<table striped="1"> <tr>
<th> Option </th>
<th> Usage </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> remove_diacritics </td>
<td>This option should be set to "0", "1" or "2". The default value is "1". If it is set to "1" or "2", then diacritics are removed from Latin script characters as described above. However, if it is set to "1", then diacritics are not removed in the fairly uncommon case where a single unicode codepoint is used to represent a character with more that one diacritic. For example, diacritics are not removed from codepoint 0x1ED9 ("LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH CIRCUMFLEX AND DOT BELOW"). This is technically a bug, but cannot be fixed without creating backwards compatibility problems. If this option is set to "2", then diacritics are correctly removed from all Latin characters. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> categories </td>
<td>This option may be used to modify the set of Unicode general categories that are considered to correspond to token characters. The argument must consist of a space separated list of two-character general category abbreviations (e.g. "Lu" or "Nd"), or of the same with the second character replaced with an asterisk ("*"), interpreted as a glob pattern. The default value is "L* N* Co". </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> tokenchars </td>
<td> This option is used to specify additional unicode characters that should be considered token characters, even if they are white-space or punctuation characters according to Unicode 6.1. All characters in the string that this option is set to are considered token characters. </td>

<h3 id="ascii_tokenizer">
<span>4.3.2. </span>Ascii Tokenizer</h3> <p> The Ascii tokenizer is similar to the Unicode61 tokenizer, except that: </p>
<ul> <li> All non-ASCII characters (those with codepoints greater than 127) are always considered token characters. If any non-ASCII characters are specified as part of the separators option, they are ignored. </li>
<li> Case-folding is only performed for ASCII characters. So while "A" and "a" are considered to be equivalent, "Ã" and "ã" are distinct. </li>
<li> The remove_diacritics option is not supported. </li>
</ul> <p> For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Create an FTS5 table that uses the ascii tokenizer, but does not

    tokenize = "ascii separators '0123456789'"
);
</pre> <h3 id="porter_tokenizer">
<span>4.3.3. </span>Porter Tokenizer</h3> <p> The porter tokenizer is a wrapper tokenizer. It takes the output of some other tokenizer and applies the <a href="https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/">porter stemming algorithm</a> to each token before it returns it to FTS5. This allows search terms like "correction" to match similar words such as "corrected" or "correcting". The porter stemmer algorithm is designed for use with English language terms only - using it with other languages may or may not improve search utility. </p>
<p> By default, the porter tokenizer operates as a wrapper around the default tokenizer (unicode61). Or, if one or more extra arguments are added to the "tokenize" option following "porter", they are treated as a specification for the underlying tokenizer that the porter stemmer uses. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Two ways to create an FTS5 table that uses the porter tokenizer to
-- stem the output of the default tokenizer (unicode61). 
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts5(x, tokenize = porter);

<span>4.3.4. </span>The Trigram Tokenizer</h3> <p id="trigramidx"> The trigram tokenizer extends FTS5 to support substring matching in general, instead of the usual token matching. When using the trigram tokenizer, a query or phrase token may match any sequence of characters within a row, not just a complete token. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE tri USING fts5(a, tokenize="trigram");

</tr>
<tr>
<td> remove_diacritics </td>
<td> This value may also be set to 1 or 0 (the default). It may only be set to 1 if the case_sensitive options is set to 0 - setting both options to 1 is an error. If this option is set, then diacritics are removed from the text before matching (e.g. so that "á" matches "a"). </td>
</tr>
</table> <pre data-language="sql">-- A case-sensitive trigram index
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE tri USING fts5(a, tokenize="trigram case_sensitive 1");
</pre> <p> Unless the remove_diacritics option is set, FTS5 tables that use the trigram tokenizer also support indexed GLOB and LIKE pattern matching. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM tri WHERE a LIKE '%cdefg%';
SELECT * FROM tri WHERE a GLOB '*ij klm*xyz';
</pre> <p> If an FTS5 trigram tokenizer is created with the case_sensitive option set to 1, it may only index GLOB queries, not LIKE. </p>
<p> Notes: </p>
<ul> <li> Substrings consisting of fewer than 3 unicode characters do not match any rows when used with a full-text query. If a LIKE or GLOB pattern does not contain at least one sequence of non-wildcard unicode characters, FTS5 falls back to a linear scan of the entire table. </li>
<li> If the FTS5 table is created with the detail=none or detail=column option specified, full-text queries may not contain any tokens longer than 3 unicode characters. LIKE and GLOB pattern matching may be slightly slower, but still works. If the index is to be used only for LIKE and/or GLOB pattern matching, these options are worth experimenting with to reduce the index size. </li>

<span>4.4. </span>External Content and Contentless Tables</h2> <p id="external_content_and_contentless_tables"> Normally, when a row is inserted into an FTS5 table, in addition to building the index, FTS5 makes a copy of the original row content. When column values are requested from the FTS5 table by the user or by an auxiliary function implementation, those values are read from that private copy of the content. The "content" option may be used to create an FTS5 table that stores only FTS full-text index entries. Because the column values themselves are usually much larger than the associated full-text index entries, this can save significant database space. </p>
<p> There are two ways to use the "content" option: </p>
<ul> <li> By setting it to an empty string to create a contentless FTS5 table. In this case FTS5 assumes that the original column values are unavailable to it when processing queries. Full-text queries and some auxiliary functions can still be used, but no column values apart from the rowid may be read from the table. </li>
<li> By setting it to the name of a database object (table, virtual table or view) that may be queried by FTS5 at any time to retrieve the column values. This is known as an "external content" table. In this case all FTS5 functionality may be used, but it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the contents of the full-text index are consistent with the named database object. If they are not, query results may be unpredictable. </li>

<pre data-language="sql">SELECT &lt;content_rowid&gt;, &lt;cols&gt; FROM &lt;content&gt; WHERE &lt;content_rowid&gt; = ?;
</pre> <p> In the above, &lt;content&gt; is replaced by the name of the content table. By default, &lt;content_rowid&gt; is replaced by the literal text "rowid". Or, if the "content_rowid" option is set within the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement, by the value of that option. &lt;cols&gt; is replaced by a comma-separated list of the FTS5 table column names. For example: </p>

<span>4.4.4. </span>External Content Table Pitfalls</h3> <p id="external_content_table_pitfalls"> It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that an FTS5 external content table (one with a non-empty content= option) is kept consistent with the content table itself (the table named by the content= option). If these are allowed to become inconsistent, then the results of queries against the FTS5 table may become unintuitive and appear inconsistent. </p>
<p> In these situations, the apparently inconsistent results produced by queries against the FTS5 external content table may be understood as follows: </p>
<ul> <li><p> If the query does not use the full-text index - does not contain a MATCH operator or equivalent table-valued function syntax - then the query is effectively passed through to the external content table. In this case the contents of the FTS index have no effect on the results of the query. </p></li>
<li><p> If the query does use the full text index, then the FTS5 module queries it for the set of rowid values corresponding to documents that match the query. For each such rowid, it then runs a query similar to the following to retrieve any required column values, where '?' is replaced by the rowid value, and &lt;content&gt; and &lt;content_rowid&gt; by the values specified for the content= and content_rowid= options: </p></li>
</ul> <pre data-language="sql">SELECT &lt;content_rowid&gt;, &lt;cols&gt; FROM &lt;content&gt; WHERE &lt;content_rowid&gt; = ?;
</pre> <p> For example, if a database is created using the following script: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Create and populate a table. 
CREATE TABLE tbl(a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, t TEXT);
INSERT INTO tbl VALUES(1, 'all that glitters');
INSERT INTO tbl VALUES(2, 'is not gold');

-- Create an external content FTS5 table 
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(t, content='tbl', content_rowid='a');
</pre> <p>then the content table contains two rows, but the FTS index contains no entries corresponding to them. In this case the following queries will return inconsistent results as follows: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Returns 2 rows.  Because the query does not use the FTS index, it is
-- effectively executed against table 'tbl' directly, and so returns
-- both rows.
SELECT * FROM t1;

-- Returns 0 rows.  This query does use the FTS index, which currently
-- contains no entries. So it returns 0 rows.
SELECT rowid, t FROM t1('gold')
</pre> <p> Alternatively, if the database were created and populated as follows: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Create and populate a table. 
CREATE TABLE tbl(a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, t TEXT);

-- Create an external content FTS5 table 
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(t, content='tbl', content_rowid='a');

INSERT INTO ft(rowid, t) VALUES(2, 'is not gold');
</pre> <p>then the content table is empty, but the FTS index contains entries for 6 different tokens. In this case the following queries will return inconsistent results as follows: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Returns 0 rows.  Since it does not use the FTS index, the query is
-- passed directly through to table 'tbl', which contains no data.
SELECT * FROM t1;

-- Returns 1 row. The "rowid" field of the returned row is 2, and
-- the "t" field set to NULL. "t" is set to NULL because when the external
-- content table "tbl" was queried for the data associated with the row
-- with a=2 ("a" is the content_rowid column), none could be found.
SELECT rowid, t FROM t1('gold')
</pre> <p>As described in the previous section, triggers on the content table are a good way to ensure that an FTS5 external content table is kept consistent. However, triggers are only fired when rows are inserted, updated or deleted in the content table. This means that if, for example, a database is created as follows: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Create and populate a table. 
CREATE TABLE tbl(a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, t TEXT);
INSERT INTO tbl VALUES(1, 'all that glitters');
INSERT INTO tbl VALUES(2, 'is not gold');

-- Create an external content FTS5 table 
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(t, content='tbl', content_rowid='a');

-- Create triggers to keep the FTS5 table up to date
CREATE TRIGGER tbl_ai AFTER INSERT ON tbl BEGIN
  INSERT INTO ft(rowid, t) VALUES (new.a, new.t);
END;
&lt;similar triggers for update + delete&gt;
</pre> <p>then the content table and external content FTS5 table are inconsistent, as creating the triggers does not copy existing rows from the content table into the FTS index. The triggers are only able to ensure that updates made to the content table after they are created are reflected in the FTS index. </p>
<p>In this, and any other situation where the FTS index and its content table have become inconsistent, the <a href="#the_rebuild_command">'rebuild'</a> command may be used to completely discard the contents of the FTS index and rebuild it based on the current contents of the content table. </p> <h2 tags="FTS5 columnsize option" id="the_columnsize_option">

-- Three equivalent ways of creating a table that does store the
-- xColumnSize() values on disk:
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a, b, c);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a, b, c, columnsize=1);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a, b, columnsize='1', c);
</pre> <p> It is an error to set the columnsize option to any value other than 0 or 1. </p>
<p> If an FTS5 table is configured with columnsize=0 but is not a <a href="fts5.html#contentless_tables">contentless table</a>, the xColumnSize API function still works, but runs much more slowly. In this case, instead of reading the value to return directly from the database, it reads the text value itself and count the tokens within it on demand. </p>
<p>Or, if the table is also a <a href="fts5.html#contentless_tables">contentless table</a>, then the following apply: </p>
<ul> <li> <p>The xColumnSize API always returns -1. There is no way to determine the number of tokens in a value stored within a contentless FTS5 table configured with columnsize=0. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>Each inserted row must be accompanied by an explicitly specified rowid value. If a contentless table is configured with columnsize=0, attempting to insert a NULL value into the rowid is an SQLITE_MISMATCH error. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>All queries on the table must be full-text queries. In other words, they must use the MATCH or = operator with the table-name column as the left-hand operand, or else use the table-valued function syntax. Any query that is not a full-text query results in an error. </p>
</li>
</ul> <p> The name of the table in which the xColumnSize values are stored (unless columnsize=0 is specified) is "&lt;name&gt;_docsize", where &lt;name&gt; is the name of the FTS5 table itself. The <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite3_analyzer</a> tool may be used on an existing database in order to determine how much space might be saved by recreating an FTS5 table using columnsize=0. </p> <h2 tags="FTS5 detail option" id="the_detail_option">
<span>4.6. </span>The Detail Option</h2> <p id="the_detail_option"> For each term in a document, the FTS index maintained by FTS5 stores the rowid of the document, the column number of the column that contains the term and the offset of the term within the column value. The "detail" option may be used to omit some of this information. This reduces the space that the index consumes within the database file, but also reduces the capability and efficiency of the system. </p>
<p> The detail option may be set to "full" (the default value), "column" or "none". For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- The following two lines are equivalent (because the default value
-- of "detail" is "full". 
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft1 USING fts5(a, b, c);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft1 USING fts5(a, b, c, detail=full);

CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft2 USING fts5(a, b, c, detail=column);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft3 USING fts5(a, b, c, detail=none);
</pre> <p>If the detail option is set to <b>column</b>, then for each term the FTS index records the rowid and column number only, omitting the term offset information. This results in the following restrictions: </p>
<ul> <li> NEAR queries are not available. </li>
<li> Phrase queries are not available. </li>
<li> Assuming the table is not also a <a href="fts5.html#contentless_tables">contentless table</a>, the <a href="#xInstCount">xInstCount</a>, <a href="#xInst">xInst</a>, <a href="#xPhraseFirst">xPhraseFirst</a> and <a href="#xPhraseNext">xPhraseNext</a> are slower than usual. This is because instead of reading the required data directly from the FTS index they have to load and tokenize the document text on demand. </li>
<li> If the table is also a contentless table, the xInstCount, xInst, xPhraseFirst and xPhraseNext APIs behave as if the current row contains no phrase matches at all (i.e. xInstCount() returns 0). </li>
</ul> <p>If the detail option is set to <b>none</b>, then for each term the FTS index records just the rowid is stored. Both column and offset information are omitted. As well as the restrictions itemized above for detail=column mode, this imposes the following extra limitations: </p>
<ul> <li> Column filter queries are not available. </li>
<li> Assuming the table is not also a contentless table, the <a href="#xPhraseFirstColumn">xPhraseFirstColumn</a> and <a href="#xPhraseNextColumn">xPhraseNextColumn</a> are slower than usual. </li>
<li> If the table is also a contentless table, the xPhraseFirstColumn and xPhraseNextColumn APIs behave as if the current row contains no phrase matches at all (i.e. xPhraseFirstColumn() sets the iterator to EOF). </li>
</ul> <p> In one test that indexed a large set of emails (1636 MiB on disk), the FTS index was 743 MiB on disk with detail=full, 340 MiB with detail=column and 134 MiB with detail=none. </p> <h1 tags="FTS5 auxiliary functions" id="_auxiliary_functions_">
<span>5. </span> Auxiliary Functions </h1> <p id="_auxiliary_functions_"> Auxiliary functions are similar to <a href="lang_corefunc.html">SQL scalar functions</a>, except that they may only be used within full-text queries (those that use the MATCH operator) on an FTS5 table. Their results are calculated based not only on the arguments passed to them, but also on the current match and matched row. For example, an auxiliary function may return a numeric value indicating the accuracy of the match (see the <a href="fts5.html#the_bm25_function">bm25()</a> function), or a fragment of text from the matched row that contains one or more instances of the search terms (see the <a href="fts5.html#the_snippet_function">snippet()</a> function). </p>
<p>To invoke an auxiliary function, the name of the FTS5 table should be specified as the first argument. Other arguments may follow the first, depending on the specific auxiliary function being invoked. For example, to invoke the "highlight" function: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">SELECT highlight(email, 2, '&lt;b&gt;', '&lt;/b&gt;') FROM email WHERE email MATCH 'fts5'
</pre> <p>The built-in auxiliary functions provided as part of FTS5 are described in the following section. Applications may also implement <a href="fts5.html#custom_auxiliary_functions">custom auxiliary functions in C</a>. </p>
<h2 id="built_in_auxiliary_functions">
<span>5.1. </span>Built-in Auxiliary Functions</h2> <p> FTS5 provides three built-in auxiliary functions: </p>
<ul> <li> The <a href="fts5.html#the_bm25_function">bm25() auxiliary function</a> returns a real value reflecting the accuracy of the current match. Better matches are assigned numerically lower values. </li>
<li> The <a href="fts5.html#the_highlight_function">highlight() auxiliary function</a> returns a copy of the text from one of the columns of the current match with each instance of a queried term within the result surrounded by specified markup (for example "&lt;b&gt;" and "&lt;/b&gt;"). </li>
<li> The <a href="fts5.html#the_snippet_function">snippet() auxiliary function</a> selects a short fragment of text from one of the columns of the matched row and returns it with each instance of a queried term surrounded by markup in the same manner as the highlight() function. The fragment of text is selected so as to maximize the number of queried terms it contains. </li>
</ul>  <h3 tags="FTS5 bm25" id="the_bm25_function">
<span>5.1.1. </span>The bm25() function</h3> <p id="the_bm25_function"> The built-in auxiliary function bm25() returns a real value indicating how well the current row matches the full-text query. The better the match, the numerically smaller the value returned. A query such as the following may be used to return matches in order from best to worst match: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM fts WHERE fts MATCH ? ORDER BY bm25(fts)
</pre> <p> In order to calculate a documents score, the full-text query is separated into its component phrases. The bm25 score for document <i>D</i> and query <i>Q</i> is then calculated as follows: </p>

<p> In the above, <i>nPhrase</i> is the number of phrases in the query. <i>|D|</i> is the number of tokens in the current document, and <i>avgdl</i> is the average number of tokens in all documents within the FTS5 table. <i>k<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>b</i> are both constants, hard-coded at 1.2 and 0.75 respectively. </p>
<p> The "-1" term at the start of the formula is not found in most implementations of the BM25 algorithm. Without it, a better match is assigned a numerically higher BM25 score. Since the default sorting order is "ascending", this means that appending "ORDER BY bm25(fts)" to a query would cause results to be returned in order from worst to best. The "DESC" keyword would be required in order to return the best matches first. In order to avoid this pitfall, the FTS5 implementation of BM25 multiplies the result by -1 before returning it, ensuring that better matches are assigned numerically lower scores. </p>

<p>The highlight() must be invoked with exactly three arguments following the table name. To be interpreted as follows: </p>
<ol> <li> An integer indicating the index of the FTS table column to read the text from. Columns are numbered from left to right starting at zero. </li>
<li> The text to insert before each phrase match. </li>

<span>5.2. </span>Sorting by Auxiliary Function Results</h2> <p id="sorting_by_auxiliary_function_results"> All FTS5 tables feature a special hidden column named "rank". If the current query is not a full-text query (i.e. if it does not include a MATCH operator), the value of the "rank" column is always NULL. Otherwise, in a full-text query, column rank contains by default the same value as would be returned by executing the bm25() auxiliary function with no trailing arguments. </p>
<p> The difference between reading from the rank column and using the bm25() function directly within the query is only significant when sorting by the returned value. In this case, using "rank" is faster than using bm25(). </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- The following queries are logically equivalent. But the second may
-- be faster, particularly if the caller abandons the query before
-- all rows have been returned (or if the queries were modified to 
-- include LIMIT clauses).
SELECT * FROM fts WHERE fts MATCH ? ORDER BY bm25(fts);
SELECT * FROM fts WHERE fts MATCH ? ORDER BY rank;
</pre> <p> Instead of using bm25() with no trailing arguments, the specific auxiliary function mapped to the rank column may be configured either on a per-query basis, or by setting a different persistent default for the FTS table. </p>
<p> In order to change the mapping of the rank column for a single query, a term similar to either of the following is added to the WHERE clause of a query: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">rank MATCH 'auxiliary-function-name(arg1, arg2, ...)'
rank = 'auxiliary-function-name(arg1, arg2, ...)'
</pre> <p> The right-hand-side of the MATCH or = operator must be a constant expression that evaluates to a string consisting of the auxiliary function to invoke, followed by zero or more comma separated arguments within parenthesis. Arguments must be SQL literals. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- The following queries are logically equivalent. But the second may
-- be faster. See above. 
SELECT * FROM fts WHERE fts MATCH ? ORDER BY bm25(fts, 10.0, 5.0);
SELECT * FROM fts WHERE fts MATCH ? AND rank MATCH 'bm25(10.0, 5.0)' ORDER BY rank;
</pre> <p> The table-valued function syntax may also be used to specify an alternative ranking function. In this case the text describing the ranking function should be specified as the second table-valued function argument. The following three queries are equivalent: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM fts WHERE fts MATCH ? AND rank MATCH 'bm25(10.0, 5.0)' ORDER BY rank;
SELECT * FROM fts WHERE fts = ? AND rank = 'bm25(10.0, 5.0)' ORDER BY rank;

<h1 id="special_insert_commands">
<span>6. </span>Special INSERT Commands</h1>  <h2 tags="FTS5 automerge option" id="the_automerge_configuration_option">
<span>6.1. </span>The 'automerge' Configuration Option</h2> <p id="the_automerge_configuration_option"> Instead of using a single data structure on disk to store the full-text index, FTS5 uses a series of b-trees. Each time a new transaction is committed, a new b-tree containing the contents of the committed transaction is written into the database file. When the full-text index is queried, each b-tree must be queried individually and the results merged before being returned to the user. </p>
<p> In order to prevent the number of b-trees in the database from becoming too large (slowing down queries), smaller b-trees are periodically merged into single larger b-trees containing the same data. By default, this happens automatically within INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements that modify the full-text index. The 'automerge' parameter determines how many smaller b-trees are merged together at a time. Setting it to a small value can speed up queries (as they have to query and merge the results from fewer b-trees), but can also slow down writing to the database (as each INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement has to do more work as part of the automatic merging process). </p>
<p> Each of the b-trees that make up the full-text index is assigned to a "level" based on its size. Level-0 b-trees are the smallest, as they contain the contents of a single transaction. Higher level b-trees are the result of merging two or more level-0 b-trees together and so they are larger. FTS5 begins to merge b-trees together once there exist <i>M</i> or more b-trees with the same level, where <i>M</i> is the value of the 'automerge' parameter. </p>
<p> The maximum allowed value for the 'automerge' parameter is 16. The default value is 4. Setting the 'automerge' parameter to 0 disables the automatic incremental merging of b-trees altogether. </p>
<pre data-language="sql">INSERT INTO ft(ft, rank) VALUES('automerge', 8);
</pre> <h2 id="the_crisismerge_configuration_option">
<span>6.2. </span>The 'crisismerge' Configuration Option</h2> <p>The 'crisismerge' option is similar to 'automerge', in that it determines how and how often the component b-trees that make up the full-text index are merged together. Once there exist <i>C</i> or more b-trees on a single level within the full-text index, where <i>C</i> is the value of the 'crisismerge' option, all b-trees on the level are immediately merged into a single b-tree. </p>
<p>The difference between this option and the 'automerge' option is that when the 'automerge' limit is reached FTS5 only begins to merge the b-trees together. Most of the work is performed as part of subsequent INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE operations. Whereas when the 'crisismerge' limit is reached, the offending b-trees are all merged immediately. This means that an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE that triggers a crisis-merge may take a long time to complete. </p>
<p>The default 'crisismerge' value is 16. There is no maximum limit. Attempting to set the 'crisismerge' parameter to a value of 0 or 1 is equivalent to setting it to the default value (16). It is an error to attempt to set the 'crisismerge' option to a negative value. </p>
<pre data-language="sql">INSERT INTO ft(ft, rank) VALUES('crisismerge', 16);
</pre>  <h2 tags="FTS5 delete command" id="the_delete_command">
<span>6.3. </span>The 'delete' Command</h2> <p id="the_delete_command"> This command is only available with <a href="fts5.html#external_content_tables">external content</a> and <a href="fts5.html#contentless_tables">contentless</a> tables. It is used to delete the index entries associated with a single row from the full-text index. This command and the <a href="fts5.html#the_delete_all_command">delete-all</a> command are the only ways to remove entries from the full-text index of a contentless table. </p>
<p> In order to use this command to delete a row, the text value 'delete' must be inserted into the special column with the same name as the table. The rowid of the row to delete is inserted into the rowid column. The values inserted into the other columns must match the values currently stored in the table. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Insert a row with rowid=14 into the fts5 table.
INSERT INTO ft(rowid, a, b, c) VALUES(14, $a, $b, $c);

-- Remove the same row from the fts5 table.
INSERT INTO ft(ft, rowid, a, b, c) VALUES('delete', 14, $a, $b, $c);
</pre> <p> If the values "inserted" into the text columns as part of a 'delete' command are not the same as those currently stored within the table, the results may be unpredictable. </p>
<p> The reason for this is easy to understand: When a document is inserted into the FTS5 table, an entry is added to the full-text index to record the position of each token within the new document. When a document is removed, the original data is required in order to determine the set of entries that need to be removed from the full-text index. So if the data supplied to FTS5 when a row is deleted using this command is different from that used to determine the set of token instances when it was inserted, some full-text index entries may not be correctly deleted, or FTS5 may try to remove index entries that do not exist. This can leave the full-text index in an unpredictable state, making future query results unreliable. </p> <h2 tags="FTS5 delete-all command" id="the_delete_all_command">

<p> When a row is deleted from a contentless-delete table, the entries associated with its tokens are not immediately removed from the FTS index. Instead, a "tombstone" marker containing the rowid of the deleted row is attached to the b-tree that contains the row's FTS index entries. When the b-tree is queried, any query result rows for which there exist tombstone markers are omitted from the results. When the b-tree is merged with other b-trees, both the deleted rows and their tombstone markers are discarded. </p>
<p> This option specifies a minimum percentage of rows in a b-tree that must have tombstone markers before the b-tree is made eligible for merging - either by <a href="#the_automerge_configuration_option">automatic</a> merges or explicit user <a href="https://sqlite.org/the_merge_command">'merge'</a> commands - even if it does not meet the usual criteria as determined by the 'automerge' and <a href="#the_usermerge_configuration_option">'usermerge'</a> options. </p>
<p> For example, to specify that FTS5 should consider merging a component b-tree after 15% of its rows have associated tombstone markers: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">INSERT INTO ft(ft, rank) VALUES('deletemerge', 15);
</pre> <p> The default value of this option is 10. Attempting to set it to less than zero restores the default value. Setting this option to 0 or to greater than 100 ensures that b-trees are never made eligible for merging due to tombstone markers. </p>

<p>The integrity-check command is invoked by inserting the text value 'integrity-check' into the special column with the same name as the FTS5 table. If a value is supplied for the "rank" column, it must be either 0 or 1. For example: </p>

</pre> <p> This command merges b-tree structures together until roughly N pages of merged data have been written to the database, where N is the absolute value of the parameter specified as part of the 'merge' command. The size of each page is as configured by the <a href="fts5.html#the_pgsz_configuration_option">FTS5 pgsz option</a>. </p>
<p> If the parameter is a positive value, B-tree structures are only eligible for merging if one of the following is true: </p>
<ul> <li> There are U or more such b-trees on a single level (see the documentation for the <a href="fts5.html#the_automerge_configuration_option">FTS5 automerge option</a> for an explanation of b-tree levels), where U is the value assigned to the <a href="fts5.html#the_usermerge_configuration_option">FTS5 usermerge option</a> option. </li>
<li> A merge has already been started (perhaps by a 'merge' command that specified a negative parameter). </li>
</ul> <p> It is possible to tell whether or not the 'merge' command found any b-trees to merge together by checking the value returned by the <a href="c3ref/total_changes.html">sqlite3_total_changes()</a> API before and after the command is executed. If the difference between the two values is 2 or greater, then work was performed. If the difference is less than 2, then the 'merge' command was a no-op. In this case there is no reason to execute the same 'merge' command again, at least until after the FTS table is next updated. </p>
<p> If the parameter is negative, and there are B-tree structures on more than one level within the FTS index, all B-tree structures are assigned to the same level before the merge operation is commenced. Additionally, if the parameter is negative, the value of the usermerge configuration option is not respected - as few as two b-trees from the same level may be merged together. </p>
<p> The above means that executing the 'merge' command with a negative parameter until the before and after difference in the return value of <a href="c3ref/total_changes.html">sqlite3_total_changes()</a> is less than two optimizes the FTS index in the same way as the <a href="fts5.html#the_optimize_command">FTS5 optimize command</a>. However, if a new b-tree is added to the FTS index while this process is ongoing, FTS5 will move the new b-tree to the same level as the existing b-trees and restart the merge. To avoid this, only the first call to 'merge' should specify a negative parameter. Each subsequent call to 'merge' should specify a positive value so that the merge started by the first call is run to completion even if new b-trees are added to the FTS index. </p> <h2 tags="FTS5 optimize command" id="the_optimize_command">

</ul> <p> The built-in tokenizers and auxiliary functions described in this document are all implemented using the publicly available API described below. </p>
<p> Before a new auxiliary function or tokenizer implementation may be registered with FTS5, an application must obtain a pointer to the "fts5_api" structure. There is one fts5_api structure for each database connection with which the FTS5 extension is registered. To obtain the pointer, the application invokes the SQL user-defined function fts5() with a single argument. That argument must be set to a pointer to a pointer to an fts5_api object using the <a href="c3ref/bind_blob.html">sqlite3_bind_pointer()</a> interface. The following example code demonstrates the technique: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">/*
** Return a pointer to the fts5_api pointer for database connection db.
** If an error occurs, return NULL and leave an error in the database
** handle (accessible using sqlite3_errcode()/errmsg()).

</pre> <p><b>Backwards Compatibility Warning:</b> Prior to SQLite version 3.20.0 (2017-08-01), the fts5() worked slightly differently. Older applications that extend FTS5 must be revised to use the new technique shown above. </p>
<p> The fts5_api structure is defined as follows. It exposes three methods, one each for registering new auxiliary functions and tokenizers, and one for retrieving existing tokenizer.

#define FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED    0x0001      /* Same position as prev. token */
</pre> <p> The implementation is registered with the FTS5 module by calling the xCreateTokenizer() method of the fts5_api object. If there is already a tokenizer with the same name, it is replaced. If a non-NULL xDestroy parameter is passed to xCreateTokenizer(), it is invoked with a copy of the pUserData pointer passed as the only argument when the database handle is closed or when the tokenizer is replaced. </p>
<p> If successful, xCreateTokenizer() returns SQLITE_OK. Otherwise, it returns an SQLite error code. In this case the xDestroy function is <b>not</b> invoked. </p>
<p> When an FTS5 table uses the custom tokenizer, the FTS5 core calls xCreate() once to create a tokenizer, then xTokenize() zero or more times to tokenize strings, then xDelete() to free any resources allocated by xCreate(). More specifically: </p>
<dl> <dt><b>xCreate:</b></dt>
<dd>
<p> This function is used to allocate and initialize a tokenizer instance. A tokenizer instance is required to actually tokenize text. </p>
<p> The first argument passed to this function is a copy of the (void*) pointer provided by the application when the fts5_tokenizer object was registered with FTS5 (the third argument to xCreateTokenizer()). The second and third arguments are an array of nul-terminated strings containing the tokenizer arguments, if any, specified following the tokenizer name as part of the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement used to create the FTS5 table. </p>
<p> The final argument is an output variable. If successful, (*ppOut) should be set to point to the new tokenizer handle and SQLITE_OK returned. If an error occurs, some value other than SQLITE_OK should be returned. In this case, fts5 assumes that the final value of *ppOut is undefined. </p>
<p> </p>
</dd>
<dt><b> xDelete:</b></dt>
<dd>
<p> This function is invoked to delete a tokenizer handle previously allocated using xCreate(). Fts5 guarantees that this function will be invoked exactly once for each successful call to xCreate(). </p>
<p> </p>
</dd>
<dt><b> xTokenize:</b></dt>
<dd>
<p> This function is expected to tokenize the nText byte string indicated by argument pText. pText may or may not be nul-terminated. The first argument passed to this function is a pointer to an Fts5Tokenizer object returned by an earlier call to xCreate(). </p>
<p> The second argument indicates the reason that FTS5 is requesting tokenization of the supplied text. This is always one of the following four values: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_DOCUMENT</b> - A document is being inserted into or removed from the FTS table. The tokenizer is being invoked to determine the set of tokens to add to (or delete from) the FTS index. <p> </p>
</li>
<li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY</b> - A MATCH query is being executed against the FTS index. The tokenizer is being called to tokenize a bareword or quoted string specified as part of the query. <p> </p>
</li>
<li> <b>(FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY | FTS5_TOKENIZE_PREFIX)</b> - Same as FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY, except that the bareword or quoted string is followed by a "*" character, indicating that the last token returned by the tokenizer will be treated as a token prefix. <p> </p>
</li>
<li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_AUX</b> - The tokenizer is being invoked to satisfy an fts5_api.xTokenize() request made by an auxiliary function. Or an fts5_api.xColumnSize() request made by the same on a columnsize=0 database. </li>
</ul> <p> For each token in the input string, the supplied callback xToken() must be invoked. The first argument to it should be a copy of the pointer passed as the second argument to xTokenize(). The third and fourth arguments are a pointer to a buffer containing the token text, and the size of the token in bytes. The 4th and 5th arguments are the byte offsets of the first byte of and first byte immediately following the text from which the token is derived within the input. </p>
<p> The second argument passed to the xToken() callback ("tflags") should normally be set to 0. The exception is if the tokenizer supports synonyms. In this case see the discussion below for details. </p>
<p> FTS5 assumes the xToken() callback is invoked for each token in the order that they occur within the input text. </p>
<p> If an xToken() callback returns any value other than SQLITE_OK, then the tokenization should be abandoned and the xTokenize() method should immediately return a copy of the xToken() return value. Or, if the input buffer is exhausted, xTokenize() should return SQLITE_OK. Finally, if an error occurs with the xTokenize() implementation itself, it may abandon the tokenization and return any error code other than SQLITE_OK or SQLITE_DONE. </p>

<h3 id="synonym_support">
<span>7.1.1. </span>Synonym Support</h3> <p> Custom tokenizers may also support synonyms. Consider a case in which a user wishes to query for a phrase such as "first place". Using the built-in tokenizers, the FTS5 query 'first + place' will match instances of "first place" within the document set, but not alternative forms such as "1st place". In some applications, it would be better to match all instances of "first place" or "1st place" regardless of which form the user specified in the MATCH query text. </p>
<p> There are several ways to approach this in FTS5: </p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li> By mapping all synonyms to a single token. In this case, using the above example, this means that the tokenizer returns the same token for inputs "first" and "1st". Say that token is in fact "first", so that when the user inserts the document "I won 1st place" entries are added to the index for tokens "i", "won", "first" and "place". If the user then queries for '1st + place', the tokenizer substitutes "first" for "1st" and the query works as expected. <p> </p>
</li>
<li> By querying the index for all synonyms of each query term separately. In this case, when tokenizing query text, the tokenizer may provide multiple synonyms for a single term within the document. FTS5 then queries the index for each synonym individually. For example, faced with the query: <p> </p>
<pre data-language="sql">... MATCH 'first place'
</pre> <p> the tokenizer offers both "1st" and "first" as synonyms for the first token in the MATCH query and FTS5 effectively runs a query similar to: </p>
<p> </p>
<pre data-language="sql">... MATCH '(first OR 1st) place'
</pre> <p> except that, for the purposes of auxiliary functions, the query still appears to contain just two phrases - "(first OR 1st)" being treated as a single phrase. </p>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li> By adding multiple synonyms for a single term to the FTS index. Using this method, when tokenizing document text, the tokenizer provides multiple synonyms for each token. So that when a document such as "I won first place" is tokenized, entries are added to the FTS index for "i", "won", "first", "1st" and "place". <p> This way, even if the tokenizer does not provide synonyms when tokenizing query text (it should not - to do so would be inefficient), it doesn't matter if the user queries for 'first + place' or '1st + place', as there are entries in the FTS index corresponding to both forms of the first token. </p>
</li>
</ol> <p> Whether it is parsing document or query text, any call to xToken that specifies a <i>tflags</i> argument with the FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED bit is considered to supply a synonym for the previous token. For example, when parsing the document "I won first place", a tokenizer that supports synonyms would call xToken() 5 times, as follows: </p>
<p> </p>
<pre data-language="sql">xToken(pCtx, 0, "i",                      1,  0,  1);
xToken(pCtx, 0, "won",                    3,  2,  5);
xToken(pCtx, 0, "first",                  5,  6, 11);
xToken(pCtx, FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED, "1st", 3,  6, 11);
xToken(pCtx, 0, "place",                  5, 12, 17);
</pre> <p> It is an error to specify the FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED flag the first time xToken() is called. Multiple synonyms may be specified for a single token by making multiple calls to xToken(FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED) in sequence. There is no limit to the number of synonyms that may be provided for a single token. </p>
<p> In many cases, method (1) above is the best approach. It does not add extra data to the FTS index or require FTS5 to query for multiple terms, so it is efficient in terms of disk space and query speed. However, it does not support prefix queries very well. If, as suggested above, the token "first" is substituted for "1st" by the tokenizer, then the query: </p>
<p> </p>
<pre data-language="sql">... MATCH '1s*'
</pre> <p> will not match documents that contain the token "1st" (as the tokenizer will probably not map "1s" to any prefix of "first"). </p>
<p> For full prefix support, method (3) may be preferred. In this case, because the index contains entries for both "first" and "1st", prefix queries such as 'fi*' or '1s*' will match correctly. However, because extra entries are added to the FTS index, this method uses more space within the database. </p>
<p> Method (2) offers a midpoint between (1) and (3). Using this method, a query such as '1s*' will match documents that contain the literal token "1st", but not "first" (assuming the tokenizer is not able to provide synonyms for prefixes). However, a non-prefix query like '1st' will match against "1st" and "first". This method does not require extra disk space, as no extra entries are added to the FTS index. On the other hand, it may require more CPU cycles to run MATCH queries, as separate queries of the FTS index are required for each synonym. </p>
<p> When using methods (2) or (3), it is important that the tokenizer only provide synonyms when tokenizing document text (method (3)) or query text (method (2)), not both. Doing so will not cause any errors, but is inefficient. </p> <h2 tags="FTS5 custom auxiliary functions" id="custom_auxiliary_functions">

</pre> <p> The implementation is registered with the FTS5 module by calling the xCreateFunction() method of the fts5_api object. If there is already an auxiliary function with the same name, it is replaced by the new function. If a non-NULL xDestroy parameter is passed to xCreateFunction(), it is invoked with a copy of the pUserData pointer passed as the only argument when the database handle is closed or when the registered auxiliary function is replaced. </p>
<p> If successful, xCreateFunction() returns SQLITE_OK. Otherwise, it returns an SQLite error code. In this case the xDestroy function is <b>not</b> invoked. </p>
<p> The final three arguments passed to the auxiliary function callback are similar to the three arguments passed to the implementation of a scalar SQL function. All arguments except the first passed to the auxiliary function are available to the implementation in the apVal[] array. The implementation should return a result or error via the content handle pCtx. </p>
<p> The first argument passed to an auxiliary function callback is a pointer to a structure containing methods that may be invoked in order to obtain information regarding the current query or row. The second argument is an opaque handle that should be passed as the first argument to any such method invocation. For example, the following auxiliary function definition returns the total number of tokens in all columns of the current row: </p>

<p> Each fts5vocab table is associated with a single FTS5 table. An fts5vocab table is usually created by specifying two arguments in place of column names in the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement - the name of the associated FTS5 table and the type of fts5vocab table. Currently there are three types of fts5vocab table; "row", "col" and "instance". Unless the fts5vocab table is created within the "temp" database, it must be part of the same database as the associated FTS5 table. </p>

</pre> <p> If an fts5vocab table is created in the temp database, it may be associated with an FTS5 table in any attached database. In order to attach the fts5vocab table to an FTS5 table located in a database other than "temp", the name of the database is inserted before the FTS5 table name in the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE arguments. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Create an fts5vocab "row" table to query the full-text index belonging

<span>9. </span>FTS5 Data Structures</h1> <p id="fts5shadowtables">This section describes at a high-level the way the FTS module stores its index and content in the database. It is not necessary to read or understand the material in this section in order to use FTS in an application. However, it may be useful to application developers attempting to analyze and understand FTS performance characteristics, or to developers contemplating enhancements to the existing FTS feature set. </p>
<p> When an FTS5 virtual table is created in a database, between 3 and 5 real tables are created in the database. These are known as "<a href="vtab.html#xshadowname">shadow tables</a>", and are used by the virtual table module to store persistent data. They should not be accessed directly by the user. Many other virtual table modules, including <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> and <a href="rtree.html">rtree</a>, also create and use shadow tables. </p>
<p>FTS5 creates the following shadow tables. In each case the actual table name is based on the name of the FTS5 virtual table (in the following, replace % with the name of the virtual table to find the actual shadow table name). </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- This table contains most of the full-text index data. 
CREATE TABLE %_data(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, block BLOB);

-- This table contains the remainder of the full-text index data. 
-- It is almost always much smaller than the %_data table. 
CREATE TABLE %_idx(segid, term, pgno, PRIMARY KEY(segid, term)) WITHOUT ROWID;

-- Contains the values of persistent configuration parameters.
CREATE TABLE %_config(k PRIMARY KEY, v) WITHOUT ROWID;

-- Contains the size of each column of each row in the virtual table
-- in tokens. This shadow table is not present if the "columnsize"
-- option is set to 0.
CREATE TABLE %_docsize(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, sz BLOB);

-- Contains the actual data inserted into the FTS5 table. There
-- is one "cN" column for each indexed column in the FTS5 table.
-- This shadow table is not present for contentless or external 
-- content FTS5 tables. 
CREATE TABLE %_content(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, c0, c1...);
</pre> <p>The following sections describe in more detail how these five tables are used to store FTS5 data. </p>
<h2 id="varint_format">
<span>9.1. </span>Varint Format</h2> <p>The sections below refer to 64-bit signed integers stored in "varint" form. FTS5 uses the same varint format as used in various places by the SQLite core. </p>
<p>A varint is between 1 and 9 bytes in length. The varint consists of either zero or more bytes which have the high-order bit set followed by a single byte with the high-order bit clear, or nine bytes, whichever is shorter. The lower seven bits of each of the first eight bytes and all 8 bits of the ninth byte are used to reconstruct the 64-bit twos-complement integer. Varints are big-endian: bits taken from the earlier byte of the varint are more significant than bits taken from the later bytes. </p>
<h2 id="the_fts_index_idx_and_data_tables_">
<span>9.2. </span>The FTS Index (%_idx and %_data tables)</h2> <p>The FTS index is an ordered key-value store where the keys are document terms or term prefixes and the associated values are "doclists". A doclist is a packed array of varints that encodes the position of each instance of the term within the FTS5 table. The position of a single term instance is defined as the combination of: </p>
<ul> <li> The rowid of the FTS5 table row it appears in, </li>
<li> The index of the column the term instance appears in (columns are numbered from left to right starting from zero), and </li>
<li> The offset of the term within the column value (i.e. the number of tokens that appear within the column value before this one). </li>
</ul> <p>The FTS index contains up to (nPrefix+1) entries for each token in the data set, where nPrefix is the number of defined <a href="#prefix_indexes"> prefix indexes</a>. </p>
<p>Keys associated with the main FTS index (the one that is not a prefix index) are prefixed with the character "0". Keys for the first prefix index are prefixed with "1". Keys for the second prefix index are prefixed with "2", and so on. For example, if the token "document" is inserted into an FTS5 table with <a href="#prefix_indexes">prefix indexes</a> specified by prefix="2 4", then the keys added to the FTS index would be "0document", "1do" and "2docu". </p>
<p>The FTS index entries are not stored in a single tree or hash table structure. Instead, they are stored in a series of immutable b-tree like structures referred to as "segment b-trees". Each time a write to the FTS5 table is committed, one or more (but usually just one) new segment b-trees are added containing both the new entries and tombstones for any deleted entries. When the FTS index is queried, the reader queries each segment b-tree in turn and merges the results, giving priority to newer data. </p>
<p>Each segment b-tree is assigned a numerical level. When a new segment b-tree is written to the database as part of committing a transaction, it is assigned to level 0. Segment b-trees belonging to a single level are periodically merged together to create a single, larger segment b-tree that is assigned to the next level (i.e. level 0 segment b-trees are merged to become a single level 1 segment b-tree). Thus the numerically larger levels contain older data in (usually) larger segment b-trees. Refer to the <a href="#the_automerge_configuration_option">'automerge'</a>, <a href="#the_crisismerge_configuration_option">'crisismerge'</a> and <a href="#the_usermerge_configuration_option">'usermerge'</a> options, along with the <a href="#the_merge_command">'merge'</a> and <a href="#the_optimize_command">'optimize'</a> commands for details on how to control the merging. </p>
<p>In cases where the doclist associated with a term or term prefix is very large, there may be an associated <a href="#doclist_index_format">doclist index</a>. A doclist index is similar to the set of internal nodes of a b-tree. It allows a large doclist to be efficiently queried for rowids or ranges of rowids. For example, when processing a query like: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">SELECT ... FROM fts_table('term') WHERE rowid BETWEEN ? AND ?
</pre> <p>FTS5 uses the segment b-tree index to locate the doclist for term "term", then uses its doclist index (assuming it is present) to efficiently identify the subset of matches with rowids in the required range. </p>

<li> The special <a href="#averages_record_format">averages record</a>, stored with id=10. </li>
<li> A record to store each <a href="#segment_b_tree_format">segment b-tree</a> leaf and <a href="#doclist_index_format">doclist index</a> leaf and internal node. See below for how id values are calculated for these records. </li>
</ul> <p>Each segment b-tree in the system is assigned a unique 16-bit segment id. Segment ids may only be reused after the original owner segment b-tree is completely merged into a higher level segment b-tree. Within a segment b-tree, each leaf page is assigned a unique page number - 1 for the first leaf page, 2 for the second, and so on. </p>
<p>Each doclist index leaf page is also assigned a page number. The first (leftmost) leaf page in a doclist index is assigned the same page number as the segment b-tree leaf page on which its term appears (because doclist indexes are only created for terms with very long doclists, at most one term per segment b-tree leaf has an associated doclist index). Call this page number P. If the doclist is so large that it requires a second leaf, the second leaf is assigned page number P+1. The third leaf P+2. Each tier of a doclist index b-tree (leaves, parents of leaves, grandparents etc.) is assigned page numbers in this fashion, starting with page number P. </p>
<p>The "id" value used in the %_data table to store any given segment b-tree leaf or doclist index leaf or node is composed as follows: </p>
<table striped="1"> <tr>

<span>9.2.2. </span>Structure Record Format</h3> <p>The structure record identifies the set of segment b-trees that make up the current FTS index, along with details of any ongoing incremental merge operations. It is stored in the %_data table with id=10. A structure record begins with a single 32-bit unsigned value - the cookie value. This value is incremented each time the structure is modified. Following the cookie value are three varint values, as follows: </p>
<ul> <li> The number of levels in the index (i.e. the maximum level associated with any segment b-tree plus one). </li>
<li> The total number of segment b-trees in the index. </li>
<li> The total number of segment b-tree leaves written to level 0 trees since the FTS5 table was created. </li>
</ul> <p>Then, for each level from 0 to nLevel: </p>
<ul> <li> The number of input segments from the previous level being used as inputs for the current incremental merge, or zero if there is no ongoing incremental merge to create a new segment b-tree for this level. </li>
<li> The total number of segment b-trees on the level. </li>
<li> Then, for each segment b-tree, from oldest to newest: <ul> <li> The segment id. </li>
<li> Page number of first leaf (often 1, always &gt;0). </li>
<li> Page number of last leaf (always &gt;0). </li>

<span>9.2.3. </span>Averages Record Format</h3> <p>The averages record, which is always stored with id=1 in the %_data table, does not store the average of anything. Instead, it contains a vector of (nCol+1) packed varint values, where nCol is the number of columns in the FTS5 table, including unindexed columns. The first varint contains the total number of rows in the FTS5 table. The second contains the total number of tokens in all values stored in the leftmost FTS5 table column. The third the number of tokens in all values for the next leftmost, and so on. The value for unindexed columns is always zero. </p>

The format consists of alternating keys and doclists packed together. </p>
<p>The first key is stored as: </p>
<ul> <li> A varint indicating the number of bytes in the key (N), followed by </li>
<li> The key data itself (N bytes). </li>

<li> A varint indicating the number of bytes in the key following the common prefix (N), followed by </li>
<li> The key suffix data itself (N bytes). </li>
</ul> <p>For example, if the first two keys in an FTS5 key/doclist record are "0challenger" and "0chandelier", then the first key is stored as varint 11 followed by the 11 bytes "0challenger", and the second key is stored as varints 4 and 7, followed by the 7 bytes "ndelier". </p>

<span>9.2.4.3. </span>Segment Index Format</h4> <p>The result of formatting the contents of the segment b-tree in the key/doclist format and then splitting it into pages is something very similar to the leaves of a b+tree. Instead of creating a format for the internal nodes of this b+tree and storing them in the %_data table alongside the leaves, the keys that would have been stored on such nodes are added to the %_idx table, defined as: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE %_idx(
  segid INTEGER,              -- segment id
  term TEXT,                  -- prefix of first key on page
  pgno INTEGER,               -- (2*pgno + bDoclistIndex)
  PRIMARY KEY(segid, term)
);
</pre> <p>For each "leaf" page that contains at least one key, an entry is added to the %_idx table. Fields are set as follows: </p>
<table striped="1"> <tr>
<th>Column</th>
<th>Contents </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>segid</td>
<td> The integer segment id. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>term</td>
<td> The smallest prefix of the first key on the page that is larger than all keys on the previous page. For the first page in a segment, this prefix is zero bytes in size. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pgno</td>
<td> This field encodes both the page number (within the segment - starting from 1) and the doclist index flag. The doclist index flag is set if the final key on the page has an <a href="#doclist_index_format">associated doclist index</a>. The value of this field is: <pre data-language="sql">
       (pgno*2 + bDoclistIndexFlag)
</pre> </td>
</tr>
</table> <p>Then, to find the leaf for segment i that may contain term t, instead of searching through internal nodes, FTS5 runs the query: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">SELECT pgno FROM %_idx WHERE segid=$i AND term&gt;=$t ORDER BY term LIMIT 1
</pre> <h4 id="doclist_index_format">
<span>9.2.4.4. </span>Doclist Index Format</h4> <p>The segment index described in the <a href="#data_term_index">previous section</a> allows a segment b-tree to be efficiently queried by term or, assuming there is a prefix index of the required size, a term prefix. The data structure described in this section, doclist indexes, allows FTS5 to efficiently search for a rowid or range or rowids within the doclist associated with a single term or term prefix. </p>
<p>Not all keys have associated doclists indexes. By default, a doclist index is only added for a key if its doclist spans more than 4 segment b-tree leaf pages. Doclist indexes are themselves b-trees, with both leaves and internal nodes stored as entries in the %_data table, but in practice most doclists are small enough to fit on a single leaf. FTS5 uses the same rough size for doclist index node and leaves as it does for segment b-tree leaves (by default 4000 bytes). </p>
<p>Doclist index leaves and internal nodes use the same page format. The first byte is a "flags" byte. This is set to 0x00 for the root page of the doclist index b-tree, and 0x01 for all other pages. The remainder of the page is a series of tightly packed varints, as follows: </p>
<ul> <li> page number of leftmost child page, followed by </li>
<li> the smallest rowid value on the left most child page, followed by </li>
<li> one varint for each subsequent child page, containing the value: <ul> <li> 0x00 if there are no rowids on the child page (this can only happen when the "child" page is actually a segment b-tree leaf), or </li>
<li> the difference between the smallest rowid on the child page and the previous rowid value stored on the doclist index page. </li>
</ul> </li>
</ul> <p>For the leftmost doclist index leaf in a doclist index, the leftmost child page is the first segment b-tree leaf after the one that contains the key itself. </p>

</li>
<li> <p>The behaviour of queries when a column-filter is specified both as part of the FTS query and by using a column as the LHS of a MATCH operator is slightly different. For a table with columns "a" and "b" and a query similar to: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">... a MATCH 'b: string'
</pre> <p>FTS3/4 searches for matches in column "b". However, FTS5 always returns zero rows, as results are first filtered for column "b", then for column "a", leaving no results. In other words, in FTS3/4 the inner filter overrides the outer, in FTS5 both filters are applied. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>The FTS query syntax (right hand side of the MATCH operator) has changed in some ways. The FTS5 syntax is quite close to the FTS4 "enhanced syntax". The main difference is that FTS5 is fussier about unrecognized punctuation characters and similar within query strings. Most queries that work with FTS3/4 should also work with FTS5, and those that do not should return parse errors. </p>
</li>
</ol> <h3 nonumber="1" id="_auxiliary_function_changes_"> Auxiliary Function Changes </h3> <p> FTS5 has no matchinfo() or offsets() function, and the snippet() function is not as fully-featured as in FTS3/4. However, since FTS5 does provide an API allowing applications to create <a href="fts5.html#_custom_auxiliary_functions_api_reference_">custom auxiliary functions</a>, any required functionality may be implemented within the application code. </p>
<p> The set of built-in auxiliary functions provided by FTS5 may be improved upon in the future. </p>

</ol>  <h2 nonumber="1" tags="fts5 technical differences" id="_summary_of_technical_differences_"> Summary of Technical Differences </h2> <p id="_summary_of_technical_differences_">FTS5 is similar to FTS3/4 in that the primary task of each is to maintain an index mapping from each unique token to a list of instances of that token within a set of documents, where each instance is identified by the document in which it appears and its position within that document. For example: </p>
<pre data-language="sql">-- Given the following SQL:
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts5(a, b);
INSERT INTO ft(rowid, a, b) VALUES(1, 'X Y', 'Y Z');
INSERT INTO ft(rowid, a, b) VALUES(2, 'A Z', 'Y Y');

-- The FTS5 module creates the following mapping on disk:
A --&gt; (2, 0, 0)
X --&gt; (1, 0, 0)
Y --&gt; (1, 0, 1) (1, 1, 0) (2, 1, 0) (2, 1, 1)
Z --&gt; (1, 1, 1) (2, 0, 1)
</pre> <p>In the example above, each triple identifies the location of a token instance by rowid, column number (columns are numbered sequentially starting at 0 from left to right) and position within the column value (the first token in a column value is 0, the second is 1, and so on). Using this index, FTS5 is able to provide timely answers to queries such as "the set of all documents that contain the token 'A'", or "the set of all documents that contain the sequence 'Y Z'". The list of instances associated with a single token is called an "instance-list". </p>
<p>The principle difference between FTS3/4 and FTS5 is that in FTS3/4, each instance-list is stored as a single large database record, whereas in FTS5 large instance-lists are divided between multiple database records. This has the following implications for dealing with large databases that contain large lists: </p>
<ul> <li> <p>FTS5 is able to load instance-lists into memory incrementally in order to reduce memory usage and peak allocation size. FTS3/4 very often loads entire instance-lists into memory. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>When processing queries that feature more than one token, FTS5 is sometimes able to determine that the query can be answered by inspecting a subset of a large instance-list. FTS3/4 almost always has to traverse entire instance-lists. </p>
</li>
<li> If an instance-list grows so large that it exceeds the <a href="limits.html#max_length">SQLITE_MAX_LENGTH</a> limit, FTS3/4 is unable to handle it. FTS5 does not have this problem. </li>
</ul> <p>For these reasons, many complex queries may use less memory and run faster using FTS5. </p>
<p>Some other ways in which FTS5 differs from FTS3/4 are: </p>
<ul> <li> <p>FTS5 supports "ORDER BY rank" for returning results in order of decreasing relevancy. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>FTS5 features an API allowing users to create custom auxiliary functions for advanced ranking and text processing applications. The special "rank" column may be mapped to a custom auxiliary function so that adding "ORDER BY rank" to a query works as expected. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>FTS5 recognizes unicode separator characters and case equivalence by default. This is also possible using FTS3/4, but must be explicitly enabled. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>The query syntax has been revised where necessary to remove ambiguities and to make it possible to escape special characters in query terms. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>By default, FTS3/4 occasionally merges together two or more of the b-trees that make up its full-text index within an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement executed by the user. This means that any operation on an FTS3/4 table may turn out to be surprisingly slow, as FTS3/4 may unpredictably choose to merge together two or more large b-trees within it. FTS5 uses incremental merging by default, which limits the amount of processing that may take place within any given INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE operation. </p>
