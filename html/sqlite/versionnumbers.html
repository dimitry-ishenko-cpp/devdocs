<span>1. </span>SQLite Version Numbers</h1> <p> Beginning with <a href="https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_9_0.html">version 3.9.0</a> (2015-10-14) SQLite uses <a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning</a>. Prior to that time, SQLite employed a version identifier that contained between two and four numbers. </p>
<h2 id="the_new_version_numbering_system_after_dateof_3_9_0_">
<span>1.1. </span>The New Version Numbering System (After 2015-10-14)</h2> <p> All SQLite releases starting with 3.9.0 use a three-number "<a href="http://semver.org">semantic version</a>" of the form X.Y.Z. The first number X is only increased when there is a change that breaks backward compatibility. The current value for X is 3, and the SQLite developers plan to support the current SQLite database file format, SQL syntax, and C interface through <a href="lts.html">at least the year 2050</a>. Hence, one can expect that all future versions of SQLite for the next several decades will begin with "3.". </p>
<p> The second number Y is incremented for any change that breaks forward compatibility by adding new features. Most future SQLite releases are expected to increment the second number Y. The Z is reset to zero whenever Y is increased. </p>
<p> The third number Z is incremented for releases consisting of only small changes that implement performance enhancements and/or bug fixes. </p>
<p> The rate of enhancement for SQLite over the previous five years (2010-2015) is approximately 6 increments of Y per year. The numbering format used by for <a href="c3ref/c_source_id.html">SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER</a> and <a href="c3ref/libversion.html">sqlite3_libversion_number()</a> allows versions up to 3.999.999, which is more than enough for the planned end-of-support date for SQLite in 2050. However, the current tarball naming conventions only reserve two digits for the Y and so the naming format for downloads will need to be revised in about 2030. </p>
<h2 id="the_historical_numbering_system_before_dateof_3_9_0_">
<span>1.2. </span>The Historical Numbering System (Before 2015-10-14)</h2> <p>This historical version numbering system used a two-, three-, or four-number version: W.X, W.X.Y, or W.X.Y.Z. W was the file format: 1 or 2 or 3. X was the major version. Y was the minor version. Z was used only for patch releases to fix bugs. </p>
<p> There have been three historical file formats for SQLite. SQLite 1.0 through 1.0.32 used the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/gdbm.html">gdbm</a> library as its storage engine. SQLite 2.0.0 through 2.8.17 used a custom b-tree storage engine that supported only text keys and data. All modern versions of SQLite (3.0.0 to present) use a b-tree storage engine that has full support for binary data and Unicode. </p>
<p> This major version number X was historically incremented only for large and important changes to the code. What constituted "large and important" was subjective. The 3.6.23 to 3.7.0 change was a result of adding support for <a href="wal.html">WAL mode</a>. The 3.7.17 to 3.8.0 change was a result of rewrite known as the <a href="queryplanner-ng.html">next generation query planner</a>. </p>
<p> The minor version number Y was historically incremented for new features and/or new interfaces that did not significantly change the structure of the code. The addition of <a href="lang_with.html">common table expressions</a>, <a href="partialindex.html">partial indexes</a>, and <a href="expridx.html">indexes on expressions</a> are all examples of "minor" changes. Again, the distinction between "major" and "minor" is subjective. </p>
<p> The patch level Z was historically only used for bug-fix releases that changed only a small number of code lines. </p>
