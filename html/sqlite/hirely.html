     <h1 class="fancy_title"> High Reliability </h1>  <p> SQLite is a high-reliability storage solution. It does not give problems. It just works. </p>
<p> The high-reliability of SQLite is proven in practice. SQLite has been used without problems in multiple billions of smart-phones, IoT devices, and desktop applications, around the world, and for almost two decades. </p>
<p> SQLite responds gracefully to system errors. Obscure out-of-memory and I/O errors are reported back up to the application. These error reporting paths are all carefully tested to ensure they will always work. </p>
<p> SQLite is resilient in the face of corrupt inputs, including maliciously designed database files and SQL strings. Extensive fuzz-testing ensures that corrupt inputs will not lead to crashes or undefined behavior, but will instead cause sensible errors to be reported back to the application. (<a href="security.html">More...</a>) </p>
<p> SQLite is built using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B">DO-178B</a>-inspired process. The <a href="testing.html">testing standards</a> for SQLite are among the highest for commercial software. </p>
<p> SQLite is <a href="https://sqlite.org/copyright.html">open-source</a> but it is not open-contribution. All the code in SQLite is written by a small team of experts. The project does not accept "pull requests" or patches from anonymous passers-by on the internet. </p>
<p> The developers of SQLite intend to support the product through the year 2050. To this end, the source code is carefully documented to promote long-term maintainability. We prefer mature and stable over trendy and cutting-edge. </p>
<p> All of these factors combine to make SQLite a very trouble-free software library. </p>
