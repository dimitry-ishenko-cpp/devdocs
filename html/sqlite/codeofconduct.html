   <h1>Code of Conduct</h1> <p> Due to concerns raised by readers, this document has been removed. The separate <a href="codeofethics.html">Code of Ethics</a> document is similar to what this document used to be, but with a different name. The new name is an effort to more clearly communicate the purpose and scope of the document. </p>
<p> To be clear: The removal of this document does not represent a policy shift. Rather the change is merely an improvement in how the policy is communicated. </p>
