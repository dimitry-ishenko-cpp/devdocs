<h1 id="id1">Reviewer Guidelines</h1> <p>Reviewing open pull requests (PRs) helps move the project forward. We encourage people outside the project to get involved as well; it’s a great way to get familiar with the codebase.</p> <section id="who-can-be-a-reviewer"> <h2>Who can be a reviewer?</h2> <p>Reviews can come from outside the NumPy team – we welcome contributions from domain experts (for instance, <code>linalg</code> or <code>fft</code>) or maintainers of other projects. You do not need to be a NumPy maintainer (a NumPy team member with permission to merge a PR) to review.</p> <p>If we do not know you yet, consider introducing yourself in <a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/community/">the mailing list or Slack</a> before you start reviewing pull requests.</p> </section> <section id="communication-guidelines"> <h2>Communication Guidelines</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>Every PR, good or bad, is an act of generosity. Opening with a positive comment will help the author feel rewarded, and your subsequent remarks may be heard more clearly. You may feel good also.</li> <li>Begin if possible with the large issues, so the author knows they’ve been understood. Resist the temptation to immediately go line by line, or to open with small pervasive issues.</li> <li>You are the face of the project, and NumPy some time ago decided <a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/">the kind of project it will be</a>: open, empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. Be <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/tzFWz5fiVKU?t=49m30s">kind</a> to contributors.</li> <li>Do not let perfect be the enemy of the good, particularly for documentation. If you find yourself making many small suggestions, or being too nitpicky on style or grammar, consider merging the current PR when all important concerns are addressed. Then, either push a commit directly (if you are a maintainer) or open a follow-up PR yourself.</li> <li>If you need help writing replies in reviews, check out some <a class="reference internal" href="#saved-replies"><span class="std std-ref">standard replies for reviewing</span></a>.</li> </ul> </section> <section id="reviewer-checklist"> <h2>Reviewer Checklist</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<dl class="simple"> <dt>Is the intended behavior clear under all conditions? Some things to watch:</dt>
<dd>
<ul> <li>What happens with unexpected inputs like empty arrays or nan/inf values?</li> <li>Are axis or shape arguments tested to be <code>int</code> or <code>tuples</code>?</li> <li>Are unusual <code>dtypes</code> tested if a function supports those?</li> </ul> </dd> </dl> </li> <li>Should variable names be improved for clarity or consistency?</li> <li>Should comments be added, or rather removed as unhelpful or extraneous?</li> <li>Does the documentation follow the <a class="reference internal" href="howto-docs.html#howto-document"><span class="std std-ref">NumPy guidelines</span></a>? Are the docstrings properly formatted?</li> <li>Does the code follow NumPy’s <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#stylistic-guidelines"><span class="std std-ref">Stylistic Guidelines</span></a>?</li> <li>If you are a maintainer, and it is not obvious from the PR description, add a short explanation of what a branch did to the merge message and, if closing an issue, also add “Closes gh-123” where 123 is the issue number.</li> <li>For code changes, at least one maintainer (i.e. someone with commit rights) should review and approve a pull request. If you are the first to review a PR and approve of the changes use the GitHub <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/">approve review</a> tool to mark it as such. If a PR is straightforward, for example it’s a clearly correct bug fix, it can be merged straight away. If it’s more complex or changes public API, please leave it open for at least a couple of days so other maintainers get a chance to review.</li> <li>If you are a subsequent reviewer on an already approved PR, please use the same review method as for a new PR (focus on the larger issues, resist the temptation to add only a few nitpicks). If you have commit rights and think no more review is needed, merge the PR.</li> </ul> <section id="for-maintainers"> <h3>For maintainers</h3> <ul class="simple"> <li>Make sure all automated CI tests pass before merging a PR, and that the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#building-docs"><span class="std std-ref">documentation builds</span></a> without any errors.</li> <li>In case of merge conflicts, ask the PR submitter to <a class="reference internal" href="development_workflow.html#rebasing-on-main"><span class="std std-ref">rebase on main</span></a>.</li> <li>For PRs that add new features or are in some way complex, wait at least a day or two before merging it. That way, others get a chance to comment before the code goes in. Consider adding it to the release notes.</li> <li>When merging contributions, a committer is responsible for ensuring that those meet the requirements outlined in the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#guidelines"><span class="std std-ref">Development process guidelines</span></a> for NumPy. Also, check that new features and backwards compatibility breaks were discussed on the <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion">numpy-discussion mailing list</a>.</li> <li>Squashing commits or cleaning up commit messages of a PR that you consider too messy is OK. Remember to retain the original author’s name when doing this. Make sure commit messages follow the <a class="reference internal" href="development_workflow.html#writing-the-commit-message"><span class="std std-ref">rules for NumPy</span></a>.</li> <li>When you want to reject a PR: if it’s very obvious, you can just close it and explain why. If it’s not, then it’s a good idea to first explain why you think the PR is not suitable for inclusion in NumPy and then let a second committer comment or close.</li> </ul> </section> <section id="github-workflow"> <h3>GitHub Workflow</h3> <p>When reviewing pull requests, please use workflow tracking features on GitHub as appropriate:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>After you have finished reviewing, if you want to ask for the submitter to make changes, change your review status to “Changes requested.” This can be done on GitHub, PR page, Files changed tab, Review changes (button on the top right).</li> <li>If you’re happy about the current status, mark the pull request as Approved (same way as Changes requested). Alternatively (for maintainers): merge the pull request, if you think it is ready to be merged.</li> </ul> <p>It may be helpful to have a copy of the pull request code checked out on your own machine so that you can play with it locally. You can use the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-cli">GitHub CLI</a> to do this by clicking the <code>Open with</code> button in the upper right-hand corner of the PR page.</p> <p>Assuming you have your <a class="reference internal" href="development_environment.html#development-environment"><span class="std std-ref">development environment</span></a> set up, you can now build the code and test it.</p> </section> </section> <section id="standard-replies-for-reviewing"> <h2 id="saved-replies">Standard replies for reviewing</h2> <p>It may be helpful to store some of these in GitHub’s <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/settings/replies/">saved replies</a> for reviewing:</p> <dl> <dt><strong>Usage question</strong></dt>

<pre data-language="md">Please make the title of the PR more descriptive.
The title will become the commit message when this is merged.
You should state what issue (or PR) it fixes/resolves in the description using the syntax described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).

<dd>
<pre data-language="md">Please add a [non-regression test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-regression_testing) that would fail at main but pass in this PR.
</pre> </dd> <dt><strong>Don’t change unrelated</strong></dt>
<dd>
<pre data-language="md">Please do not change unrelated lines. It makes your contribution harder to review and may introduce merge conflicts to other pull requests.
