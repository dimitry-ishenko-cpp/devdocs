<h1>Parallel Random Number Generation</h1> <p>There are three strategies implemented that can be used to produce repeatable pseudo-random numbers across multiple processes (local or distributed).</p> <section id="seedsequence-spawning"> <h2 id="seedsequence-spawn">SeedSequence spawning</h2> <p><a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.seedsequence.html#numpy.random.SeedSequence" title="numpy.random.SeedSequence"><code>SeedSequence</code></a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/developing-a-seed_seq-alternative.html">implements an algorithm</a> to process a user-provided seed, typically as an integer of some size, and to convert it into an initial state for a <a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.bitgenerator.html#numpy.random.BitGenerator" title="numpy.random.BitGenerator"><code>BitGenerator</code></a>. It uses hashing techniques to ensure that low-quality seeds are turned into high quality initial states (at least, with very high probability).</p> <p>For example, <a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/mt19937.html#numpy.random.MT19937" title="numpy.random.MT19937"><code>MT19937</code></a> has a state consisting of 624 <code>uint32</code> integers. A naive way to take a 32-bit integer seed would be to just set the last element of the state to the 32-bit seed and leave the rest 0s. This is a valid state for <a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/mt19937.html#numpy.random.MT19937" title="numpy.random.MT19937"><code>MT19937</code></a>, but not a good one. The Mersenne Twister algorithm <a class="reference external" href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/emt19937ar.html">suffers if there are too many 0s</a>. Similarly, two adjacent 32-bit integer seeds (i.e. <code>12345</code> and <code>12346</code>) would produce very similar streams.</p> <p><a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.seedsequence.html#numpy.random.SeedSequence" title="numpy.random.SeedSequence"><code>SeedSequence</code></a> avoids these problems by using successions of integer hashes with good <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect">avalanche properties</a> to ensure that flipping any bit in the input has about a 50% chance of flipping any bit in the output. Two input seeds that are very close to each other will produce initial states that are very far from each other (with very high probability). It is also constructed in such a way that you can provide arbitrary-sized integers or lists of integers. <a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.seedsequence.html#numpy.random.SeedSequence" title="numpy.random.SeedSequence"><code>SeedSequence</code></a> will take all of the bits that you provide and mix them together to produce however many bits the consuming <a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.bitgenerator.html#numpy.random.BitGenerator" title="numpy.random.BitGenerator"><code>BitGenerator</code></a> needs to initialize itself.</p> <p>These properties together mean that we can safely mix together the usual user-provided seed with simple incrementing counters to get <a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.bitgenerator.html#numpy.random.BitGenerator" title="numpy.random.BitGenerator"><code>BitGenerator</code></a> states that are (to very high probability) independent of each other. We can wrap this together into an API that is easy to use and difficult to misuse.</p> <pre data-language="python">from numpy.random import SeedSequence, default_rng

ss = SeedSequence(12345)

# Spawn off 10 child SeedSequences to pass to child processes.

Each <a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.seedsequence.html#numpy.random.SeedSequence" title="numpy.random.SeedSequence"><code>SeedSequence</code></a> has its position in the tree of spawned <a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.seedsequence.html#numpy.random.SeedSequence" title="numpy.random.SeedSequence"><code>SeedSequence</code></a> objects mixed in with the user-provided seed to generate independent (with very high probability) streams.</p> <pre data-language="python">grandchildren = child_seeds[0].spawn(4)

</pre> <p>This feature lets you make local decisions about when and how to split up streams without coordination between processes. You do not have to preallocate space to avoid overlapping or request streams from a common global service. This general “tree-hashing” scheme is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/myftp/papers/parallel-rng-imacs.pdf">not unique to numpy</a> but not yet widespread. Python has increasingly-flexible mechanisms for parallelization available, and this scheme fits in very well with that kind of use.</p> <p>Using this scheme, an upper bound on the probability of a collision can be estimated if one knows the number of streams that you derive. <a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.seedsequence.html#numpy.random.SeedSequence" title="numpy.random.SeedSequence"><code>SeedSequence</code></a> hashes its inputs, both the seed and the spawn-tree-path, down to a 128-bit pool by default. The probability that there is a collision in that pool, pessimistically-estimated (<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id3" id="id1">1</a>), will be about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n^2*2^{-128}\)</span> where <code>n</code> is the number of streams spawned. If a program uses an aggressive million streams, about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{20}\)</span>, then the probability that at least one pair of them are identical is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{-88}\)</span>, which is in solidly-ignorable territory (<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id2">2</a>).</p> <dl class="footnote brackets"> <dt class="label" id="id3"><span class="brackets"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">1</a></span></dt> <dd>
<p>The algorithm is carefully designed to eliminate a number of possible ways to collide. For example, if one only does one level of spawning, it is guaranteed that all states will be unique. But it’s easier to estimate the naive upper bound on a napkin and take comfort knowing that the probability is actually lower.</p> </dd> <dt class="label" id="id4"><span class="brackets"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id2">2</a></span></dt> <dd>
<p>In this calculation, we can mostly ignore the amount of numbers drawn from each stream.

Getting a collision internal to <a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.seedsequence.html#numpy.random.SeedSequence" title="numpy.random.SeedSequence"><code>SeedSequence</code></a> is the way a failure would be observed.</p> </dd> </dl> </section> <section id="independent-streams"> <h2 id="id5">Independent Streams</h2> <p><a class="reference internal" href="bit_generators/philox.html#numpy.random.Philox" title="numpy.random.Philox"><code>Philox</code></a> is a counter-based RNG based which generates values by encrypting an incrementing counter using weak cryptographic primitives.

Additionally, the <em>as-if</em> draws also depend on the size of the default random number produced by the specific BitGenerator.

<p>The jump size is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\phi-1)*2^{128}\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> is the golden ratio. As the jumps wrap around the period, the actual distances between neighboring streams will slowly grow smaller than the jump size, but using the golden ratio this way is a classic method of constructing a low-discrepancy sequence that spreads out the states around the period optimally. You will not be able to jump enough to make those distances small enough to overlap in your lifetime.</p> </dd> </dl> <p><code>jumped</code> can be used to produce long blocks which should be long enough to not overlap.</p> <pre data-language="python">import secrets

</pre> <p>When using <code>jumped</code>, one does have to take care not to jump to a stream that was already used. In the above example, one could not later use <code>blocked_rng[0].jumped()</code> as it would overlap with <code>blocked_rng[1]</code>. Like with the independent streams, if the main process here wants to split off 10 more streams by jumping, then it needs to start with <code>range(10, 20)</code>, otherwise it would recreate the same streams. On the other hand, if you carefully construct the streams, then you are guaranteed to have streams that do not overlap.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
