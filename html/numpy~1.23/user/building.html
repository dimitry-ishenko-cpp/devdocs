<h1 id="id1">Building from source</h1> <p>There are two options for building NumPy- building with Gitpod or locally from source. Your choice depends on your operating system and familiarity with the command line.</p> <section id="gitpod"> <h2>Gitpod</h2> <p>Gitpod is an open-source platform that automatically creates the correct development environment right in your browser, reducing the need to install local development environments and deal with incompatible dependencies.</p> <p>If you are a Windows user, unfamiliar with using the command line or building NumPy for the first time, it is often faster to build with Gitpod. Here are the in-depth instructions for building NumPy with <a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_gitpod.html">building NumPy with Gitpod</a>.</p> </section> <section id="building-locally"> <h2>Building locally</h2> <p>Building locally on your machine gives you more granular control. If you are a MacOS or Linux user familiar with using the command line, you can continue with building NumPy locally by following the instructions below.</p> </section> <section id="prerequisites"> <h2>Prerequisites</h2> <p>Building NumPy requires the following software installed:</p> <ol class="arabic"> <li>
<p>Python 3.8.x or newer</p> <p>Please note that the Python development headers also need to be installed, e.g., on Debian/Ubuntu one needs to install both <code>python3</code> and <code>python3-dev</code>. On Windows and macOS this is normally not an issue.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Compilers</p> <p>Much of NumPy is written in C. You will need a C compiler that complies with the C99 standard.</p> <p>Part of Numpy is now written in C++. You will also need a C++ compiler that complies with the C++11 standard.</p> <p>While a FORTRAN 77 compiler is not necessary for building NumPy, it is needed to run the <code>numpy.f2py</code> tests. These tests are skipped if the compiler is not auto-detected.</p> <p>Note that NumPy is developed mainly using GNU compilers and tested on MSVC and Clang compilers. Compilers from other vendors such as Intel, Absoft, Sun, NAG, Compaq, Vast, Portland, Lahey, HP, IBM are only supported in the form of community feedback, and may not work out of the box. GCC 4.x (and later) compilers are recommended. On ARM64 (aarch64) GCC 8.x (and later) are recommended.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Linear Algebra libraries</p> <p>NumPy does not require any external linear algebra libraries to be installed. However, if these are available, NumPy’s setup script can detect them and use them for building. A number of different LAPACK library setups can be used, including optimized LAPACK libraries such as OpenBLAS or MKL. The choice and location of these libraries as well as include paths and other such build options can be specified in a <code>site.cfg</code> file located in the NumPy root repository or a <code>.numpy-site.cfg</code> file in your home directory. See the <code>site.cfg.example</code> example file included in the NumPy repository or sdist for documentation, and below for specifying search priority from environmental variables.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Cython</p> <p>For building NumPy, you’ll need a recent version of Cython.</p> </li> </ol> </section> <section id="basic-installation"> <h2>Basic Installation</h2> <p>To install NumPy, run:</p> <pre data-language="python">pip install .
</pre> <p>To perform an in-place build that can be run from the source folder run:</p> <pre data-language="python">python setup.py build_ext --inplace
</pre> <p><em>Note: for build instructions to do development work on NumPy itself, see</em> <a class="reference internal" href="../dev/development_environment.html#development-environment"><span class="std std-ref">Setting up and using your development environment</span></a>.</p> </section> <section id="testing"> <h2>Testing</h2> <p>Make sure to test your builds. To ensure everything stays in shape, see if all tests pass.</p> <p>The test suite requires additional dependencies, which can easily be installed with:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ python -m pip install -r test_requirements.txt
</pre> <p>Run tests:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ python runtests.py -v -m full

</pre> <p>This will compile numpy on 4 CPUs and install it into the specified prefix. to perform a parallel in-place build, run:</p> <pre data-language="python">python setup.py build_ext --inplace -j 4
</pre> <p>The number of build jobs can also be specified via the environment variable <code>NPY_NUM_BUILD_JOBS</code>.</p> </section> <section id="choosing-the-fortran-compiler"> <h3>Choosing the fortran compiler</h3> <p>Compilers are auto-detected; building with a particular compiler can be done with <code>--fcompiler</code>. E.g. to select gfortran:</p> <pre data-language="python">python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95
</pre> <p>For more information see:</p> <pre data-language="python">python setup.py build --help-fcompiler
</pre> </section> <section id="how-to-check-the-abi-of-blas-lapack-libraries"> <h3>How to check the ABI of BLAS/LAPACK libraries</h3> <p>One relatively simple and reliable way to check for the compiler used to build a library is to use ldd on the library. If libg2c.so is a dependency, this means that g77 has been used (note: g77 is no longer supported for building NumPy). If libgfortran.so is a dependency, gfortran has been used. If both are dependencies, this means both have been used, which is almost always a very bad idea.</p> </section> </section> <section id="accelerated-blas-lapack-libraries"> <h2 id="id3">Accelerated BLAS/LAPACK libraries</h2> <p>NumPy searches for optimized linear algebra libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK.

When providing options that should improve the performance of the code ensure that you also set <code>-DNDEBUG</code> so that debugging code is not executed.</p> </section> <section id="cross-compilation"> <h2>Cross compilation</h2> <p>Although <code>numpy.distutils</code> and <code>setuptools</code> do not directly support cross compilation, it is possible to build NumPy on one system for different architectures with minor modifications to the build environment. This may be desirable, for example, to use the power of a high-performance desktop to create a NumPy package for a low-power, single-board computer. Because the <code>setup.py</code> scripts are unaware of cross-compilation environments and tend to make decisions based on the environment detected on the build system, it is best to compile for the same type of operating system that runs on the builder. Attempting to compile a Mac version of NumPy on Windows, for example, is likely to be met with challenges not considered here.</p> <p>For the purpose of this discussion, the nomenclature adopted by <a class="reference external" href="https://mesonbuild.com/Cross-compilation.html#cross-compilation">meson</a> will be used: the “build” system is that which will be running the NumPy build process, while the “host” is the platform on which the compiled package will be run. A native Python interpreter, the setuptools and Cython packages and the desired cross compiler must be available for the build system. In addition, a Python interpreter and its development headers as well as any external linear algebra libraries must be available for the host platform. For convenience, it is assumed that all host software is available under a separate prefix directory, here called <code>$CROSS_PREFIX</code>.</p> <p>When building and installing NumPy for a host system, the <code>CC</code> environment variable must provide the path the cross compiler that will be used to build NumPy C extensions. It may also be necessary to set the <code>LDSHARED</code> environment variable to the path to the linker that can link compiled objects for the host system. The compiler must be told where it can find Python libraries and development headers. On Unix-like systems, this generally requires adding, <em>e.g.</em>, the following parameters to the <code>CFLAGS</code> environment variable:</p> <pre data-language="python">-I${CROSS_PREFIX}/usr/include
-I${CROSS_PREFIX}/usr/include/python3.y
</pre> <p>for Python version 3.y. (Replace the “y” in this path with the actual minor number of the installed Python runtime.) Likewise, the linker should be told where to find host libraries by adding a parameter to the <code>LDFLAGS</code> environment variable:</p> <pre data-language="python">-L${CROSS_PREFIX}/usr/lib
</pre> <p>To make sure Python-specific system configuration options are provided for the intended host and not the build system, set:</p> <pre data-language="python">_PYTHON_SYSCONFIGDATA_NAME=_sysconfigdata_${ARCH_TRIPLET}
</pre> <p>where <code>${ARCH_TRIPLET}</code> is an architecture-dependent suffix appropriate for the host architecture. (This should be the name of a <code>_sysconfigdata</code> file, without the <code>.py</code> extension, found in the host Python library directory.)</p> <p>When using external linear algebra libraries, include and library directories should be provided for the desired libraries in <code>site.cfg</code> as described above and in the comments of the <code>site.cfg.example</code> file included in the NumPy repository or sdist. In this example, set:</p> <pre data-language="python">include_dirs = ${CROSS_PREFIX}/usr/include
library_dirs = ${CROSS_PREFIX}/usr/lib
</pre> <p>under appropriate sections of the file to allow <code>numpy.distutils</code> to find the libraries.</p> <p>As of NumPy 1.22.0, a vendored copy of SVML will be built on <code>x86_64</code> Linux hosts to provide AVX-512 acceleration of floating-point operations. When using an <code>x86_64</code> Linux build system to cross compile NumPy for hosts other than <code>x86_64</code> Linux, set the environment variable <code>NPY_DISABLE_SVML</code> to prevent the NumPy build script from incorrectly attempting to cross-compile this platform-specific library:</p> <pre data-language="python">NPY_DISABLE_SVML=1
</pre> <p>With the environment configured, NumPy may be built as it is natively:</p> <pre data-language="python">python setup.py build
</pre> <p>When the <code>wheel</code> package is available, the cross-compiled package may be packed into a wheel for installation on the host with:</p> <pre data-language="python">python setup.py bdist_wheel
</pre> <p>It may be possible to use <code>pip</code> to build a wheel, but <code>pip</code> configures its own environment; adapting the <code>pip</code> environment to cross-compilation is beyond the scope of this guide.</p> <p>The cross-compiled package may also be installed into the host prefix for cross-compilation of other packages using, <em>e.g.</em>, the command:</p> <pre data-language="python">python setup.py install --prefix=${CROSS_PREFIX}
</pre> <p>When cross compiling other packages that depend on NumPy, the host npy-pkg-config file must be made available.
