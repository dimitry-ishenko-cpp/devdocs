<h1 id="pointer-types">Pointer types</h1> <p>All pointers are explicit first-class values. They can be moved or copied, stored into data structs, and returned from functions.</p> <h2 id="references--and-mut">References (<code id="">&amp;</code> and <code>&amp;mut</code>)</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong><sup>Syntax</sup></strong><br> <em>ReferenceType</em> :<br> <code>&amp;</code> <a href="../trait-bounds.html"><em>Lifetime</em></a><sup>?</sup> <code>mut</code><sup>?</sup> <a href="../types.html#type-expressions"><em>TypeNoBounds</em></a></p> </blockquote> <h3 id="shared-references-">Shared references (<code id="">&amp;</code>)</h3> <p>Shared references point to memory which is owned by some other value. When a shared reference to a value is created, it prevents direct mutation of the value. <a href="../interior-mutability.html">Interior mutability</a> provides an exception for this in certain circumstances. As the name suggests, any number of shared references to a value may exist. A shared reference type is written <code>&amp;type</code>, or <code>&amp;'a type</code> when you need to specify an explicit lifetime. Copying a reference is a "shallow" operation: it involves only copying the pointer itself, that is, pointers are <code>Copy</code>. Releasing a reference has no effect on the value it points to, but referencing of a <a href="../expressions.html#temporaries">temporary value</a> will keep it alive during the scope of the reference itself.</p> <h3 id="mutable-references-mut">Mutable references (<code id="">&amp;mut</code>)</h3> <p>Mutable references point to memory which is owned by some other value. A mutable reference type is written <code>&amp;mut type</code> or <code>&amp;'a mut type</code>. A mutable reference (that hasn't been borrowed) is the only way to access the value it points to, so is not <code>Copy</code>.</p> <h2 id="raw-pointers-const-and-mut">Raw pointers (<code id="">*const</code> and <code>*mut</code>)</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong><sup>Syntax</sup></strong><br> <em>RawPointerType</em> :<br> <code>*</code> ( <code>mut</code> | <code>const</code> ) <a href="../types.html#type-expressions"><em>TypeNoBounds</em></a></p> </blockquote> <p>Raw pointers are pointers without safety or liveness guarantees. Raw pointers are written as <code>*const T</code> or <code>*mut T</code>. For example <code>*const i32</code> means a raw pointer to a 32-bit integer. Copying or dropping a raw pointer has no effect on the lifecycle of any other value. Dereferencing a raw pointer is an <a href="../unsafety.html"><code>unsafe</code> operation</a>. This can also be used to convert a raw pointer to a reference by reborrowing it (<code>&amp;*</code> or <code>&amp;mut *</code>). Raw pointers are generally discouraged; they exist to support interoperability with foreign code, and writing performance-critical or low-level functions.</p> <p>When comparing raw pointers they are compared by their address, rather than by what they point to. When comparing raw pointers to <a href="../dynamically-sized-types.html">dynamically sized types</a> they also have their additional data compared.</p> <p>Raw pointers can be created directly using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/macro.addr_of.html"><code>core::ptr::addr_of!</code></a> for <code>*const</code> pointers and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/macro.addr_of_mut.html"><code>core::ptr::addr_of_mut!</code></a> for <code>*mut</code> pointers.</p> <h2 id="smart-pointers">Smart Pointers</h2> <p>The standard library contains additional 'smart pointer' types beyond references and raw pointers.</p> <h2 id="bit-validity">Bit validity</h2> <p>Despite pointers and references being similar to <code>usize</code>s in the machine code emitted on most platforms, the semantics of transmuting a reference or pointer type to a non-pointer type is currently undecided. Thus, it may not be valid to transmute a pointer or reference type, <code>P</code>, to a <code>[u8; size_of::&lt;P&gt;()]</code>.</p> <p>For thin raw pointers (i.e., for <code>P = *const T</code> or <code>P = *mut T</code> for <code>T: Sized</code>), the inverse direction (transmuting from an integer or array of integers to <code>P</code>) is always valid. However, the pointer produced via such a transmutation may not be dereferenced (not even if <code>T</code> has size zero).</p><div class="_attribution">
