<h1 id="statements-and-expressions">Statements and expressions</h1> <p>Rust is <em>primarily</em> an expression language. This means that most forms of value-producing or effect-causing evaluation are directed by the uniform syntax category of <em>expressions</em>. Each kind of expression can typically <em>nest</em> within each other kind of expression, and rules for evaluation of expressions involve specifying both the value produced by the expression and the order in which its sub-expressions are themselves evaluated.</p> <p>In contrast, statements serve <em>mostly</em> to contain and explicitly sequence expression evaluation.</p><div class="_attribution">
