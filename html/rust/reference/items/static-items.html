All references to the static refer to the same memory location. Static items have the <code>static</code> lifetime, which outlives all other lifetimes in a Rust program. Static items do not call <a href="../destructors.html"><code>drop</code></a> at the end of the program.</p> <p>The static initializer is a <a href="../const_eval.html#constant-expressions">constant expression</a> evaluated at compile time. Static initializers may refer to other statics.</p> <p>Non-<code>mut</code> static items that contain a type that is not <a href="../interior-mutability.html">interior mutable</a> may be placed in read-only memory.</p> <p>All access to a static is safe, but there are a number of restrictions on statics:</p> <ul> <li>The type must have the <code>Sync</code> trait bound to allow thread-safe access.</li> <li>Constants cannot refer to statics.</li> </ul> <p>The initializer expression must be omitted in an <a href="external-blocks.html">external block</a>, and must be provided for free static items.</p> <h2 id="statics--generics">Statics &amp; generics</h2> <p>A static item defined in a generic scope (for example in a blanket or default implementation) will result in exactly one static item being defined, as if the static definition was pulled out of the current scope into the module. There will <em>not</em> be one item per monomorphization.</p> <p>This code:</p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};

trait Tr {
    fn default_impl() {
        static COUNTER: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);

</pre> <h2 id="mutable-statics">Mutable statics</h2> <p>If a static item is declared with the <code>mut</code> keyword, then it is allowed to be modified by the program. One of Rust's goals is to make concurrency bugs hard to run into, and this is obviously a very large source of race conditions or other bugs. For this reason, an <code>unsafe</code> block is required when either reading or writing a mutable static variable. Care should be taken to ensure that modifications to a mutable static are safe with respect to other threads running in the same process.</p> <p>Mutable statics are still very useful, however. They can be used with C libraries and can also be bound from C libraries in an <code>extern</code> block.</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
fn atomic_add(_: &amp;mut u32, _: u32) -&gt; u32 { 2 }

static mut LEVELS: u32 = 0;

// This violates the idea of no shared state, and this doesn't internally
// protect against races, so this function is `unsafe`
unsafe fn bump_levels_unsafe1() -&gt; u32 {
    let ret = LEVELS;
    LEVELS += 1;
    return ret;
}

// Assuming that we have an atomic_add function which returns the old value,
// this function is "safe" but the meaning of the return value may not be what
// callers expect, so it's still marked as `unsafe`
unsafe fn bump_levels_unsafe2() -&gt; u32 {
    return atomic_add(&amp;mut LEVELS, 1);
}
}</pre> <p>Mutable statics have the same restrictions as normal statics, except that the type does not have to implement the <code>Sync</code> trait.</p> <h2 id="using-statics-or-consts">Using Statics or Consts</h2> <p>It can be confusing whether or not you should use a constant item or a static item. Constants should, in general, be preferred over statics unless one of the following are true:</p> <ul> <li>Large amounts of data are being stored</li> <li>The single-address property of statics is required.</li> <li>Interior mutability is required.</li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
