<h1 id="how-to-write-tests">How to Write Tests</h1> <p>Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in the expected manner. The bodies of test functions typically perform these three actions:</p> <ul> <li>Set up any needed data or state.</li> <li>Run the code you want to test.</li> <li>Assert that the results are what you expect.</li> </ul> <p>Let’s look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests that take these actions, which include the <code>test</code> attribute, a few macros, and the <code>should_panic</code> attribute.</p> <h3 id="the-anatomy-of-a-test-function">The Anatomy of a Test Function</h3> <p>At its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that’s annotated with the <code>test</code> attribute. Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one example is the <code>derive</code> attribute we used with structs in Chapter 5. To change a function into a test function, add <code>#[test]</code> on the line before <code>fn</code>. When you run your tests with the <code>cargo test</code> command, Rust builds a test runner binary that runs the annotated functions and reports on whether each test function passes or fails.</p> <p>Whenever we make a new library project with Cargo, a test module with a test function in it is automatically generated for us. This module gives you a template for writing your tests so you don’t have to look up the exact structure and syntax every time you start a new project. You can add as many additional test functions and as many test modules as you want!</p> <p>We’ll explore some aspects of how tests work by experimenting with the template test before we actually test any code. Then we’ll write some real-world tests that call some code that we’ve written and assert that its behavior is correct.</p> <p>Let’s create a new library project called <code>adder</code> that will add two numbers:</p> <pre>$ cargo new adder --lib
     Created library `adder` project
$ cd adder
</pre> <p>The contents of the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file in your <code>adder</code> library should look like Listing 11-1.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>  <pre data-language="rust">pub fn add(left: u64, right: u64) -&gt; u64 {
    left + right
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 11-1: The code generated automatically by <code>cargo new</code></figcaption> </figure> <p>The file starts with an example <code>add</code> function, so that we have something to test.</p> <p>For now, let’s focus solely on the <code>it_works</code> function. Note the <code>#[test]</code> annotation: this attribute indicates this is a test function, so the test runner knows to treat this function as a test. We might also have non-test functions in the <code>tests</code> module to help set up common scenarios or perform common operations, so we always need to indicate which functions are tests.</p> <p>The example function body uses the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro to assert that <code>result</code>, which contains the result of calling <code>add</code> with 2 and 2, equals 4. This assertion serves as an example of the format for a typical test. Let’s run it to see that this test passes.</p> <p>The <code>cargo test</code> command runs all tests in our project, as shown in Listing 11-2.</p> <figure class="listing"> <pre>$ cargo test

</pre> <figcaption>Listing 11-2: The output from running the automatically generated test</figcaption> </figure> <p>Cargo compiled and ran the test. We see the line <code>running 1 test</code>. The next line shows the name of the generated test function, called <code>tests::it_works</code>, and that the result of running that test is <code>ok</code>. The overall summary <code>test result: ok.</code> means that all the tests passed, and the portion that reads <code>1 passed; 0 failed</code> totals the number of tests that passed or failed.</p> <p>It’s possible to mark a test as ignored so it doesn’t run in a particular instance; we’ll cover that in the <a href="ch11-02-running-tests.html#ignoring-some-tests-unless-specifically-requested">“Ignoring Some Tests Unless Specifically Requested”</a> section later in this chapter. Because we haven’t done that here, the summary shows <code>0 ignored</code>.</p> <p>The <code>0 measured</code> statistic is for benchmark tests that measure performance. Benchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in nightly Rust. See <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/library-features/test.html">the documentation about benchmark tests</a> to learn more.</p> <p>We can pass an argument to the <code>cargo test</code> command to run only tests whose name matches a string; this is called <em>filtering</em> and we’ll cover that in the <a href="ch11-02-running-tests.html#running-a-subset-of-tests-by-name">“Running a Subset of Tests by Name”</a> section. Here we haven’t filtered the tests being run, so the end of the summary shows <code>0 filtered out</code>.</p> <p>The next part of the test output starting at <code>Doc-tests adder</code> is for the results of any documentation tests. We don’t have any documentation tests yet, but Rust can compile any code examples that appear in our API documentation. This feature helps keep your docs and your code in sync! We’ll discuss how to write documentation tests in the <a href="ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#documentation-comments-as-tests">“Documentation Comments as Tests”</a> section of Chapter 14. For now, we’ll ignore the <code>Doc-tests</code> output.</p> <p>Let’s start to customize the test to our own needs. First, change the name of the <code>it_works</code> function to a different name, such as <code>exploration</code>, like so:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">pub fn add(left: u64, right: u64) -&gt; u64 {

    #[test]
    fn exploration() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}</pre> <p>Then run <code>cargo test</code> again. The output now shows <code>exploration</code> instead of <code>it_works</code>:</p> <pre>$ cargo test

</pre> <p>Now we’ll add another test, but this time we’ll make a test that fails! Tests fail when something in the test function panics. Each test is run in a new thread, and when the main thread sees that a test thread has died, the test is marked as failed. In Chapter 9, we talked about how the simplest way to panic is to call the <code>panic!</code> macro. Enter the new test as a function named <code>another</code>, so your <em>src/lib.rs</em> file looks like Listing 11-3.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">pub fn add(left: u64, right: u64) -&gt; u64 {

The next section lists just the names of all the failing tests, which is useful when there are lots of tests and lots of detailed failing test output. We can use the name of a failing test to run just that test to more easily debug it; we’ll talk more about ways to run tests in the <a href="ch11-02-running-tests.html#controlling-how-tests-are-run">“Controlling How Tests Are Run”</a> section.</p> <p>The summary line displays at the end: overall, our test result is <code>FAILED</code>. We had one test pass and one test fail.</p> <p>Now that you’ve seen what the test results look like in different scenarios, let’s look at some macros other than <code>panic!</code> that are useful in tests.</p> <h3 id="checking-results-with-the-assert-macro">Checking Results with the <code id="">assert!</code> Macro</h3> <p>The <code>assert!</code> macro, provided by the standard library, is useful when you want to ensure that some condition in a test evaluates to <code>true</code>. We give the <code>assert!</code> macro an argument that evaluates to a Boolean. If the value is <code>true</code>, nothing happens and the test passes. If the value is <code>false</code>, the <code>assert!</code> macro calls <code>panic!</code> to cause the test to fail. Using the <code>assert!</code> macro helps us check that our code is functioning in the way we intend.</p> <p>In Chapter 5, Listing 5-15, we used a <code>Rectangle</code> struct and a <code>can_hold</code> method, which are repeated here in Listing 11-5. Let’s put this code in the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, then write some tests for it using the <code>assert!</code> macro.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">#[derive(Debug)]

In Listing 11-6, we write a test that exercises the <code>can_hold</code> method by creating a <code>Rectangle</code> instance that has a width of 8 and a height of 7 and asserting that it can hold another <code>Rectangle</code> instance that has a width of 5 and a height of 1.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">#[derive(Debug)]

</pre> <p>Our test caught the bug! The <code>it_adds_two</code> test failed, and the message tells us <code>assertion `left == right` failed</code> and what the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> values are. This message helps us start debugging: the <code>left</code> argument, where we had the result of calling <code>add_two(2)</code>, was <code>5</code> but the <code>right</code> argument was <code>4</code>. You can imagine that this would be especially helpful when we have a lot of tests going on.</p> <p>Note that in some languages and test frameworks, the parameters to equality assertion functions are called <code>expected</code> and <code>actual</code>, and the order in which we specify the arguments matters. However, in Rust, they’re called <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>, and the order in which we specify the value we expect and the value the code produces doesn’t matter. We could write the assertion in this test as <code>assert_eq!(4, result)</code>, which would produce the same failure message that displays <code>assertion failed: `(left == right)`</code>.</p> <p>The <code>assert_ne!</code> macro will pass if the two values we give it are not equal and fail if they’re equal. This macro is most useful for cases when we’re not sure what a value <em>will</em> be, but we know what the value definitely <em>shouldn’t</em> be. For example, if we’re testing a function that is guaranteed to change its input in some way, but the way in which the input is changed depends on the day of the week that we run our tests, the best thing to assert might be that the output of the function is not equal to the input.</p> <p>Under the surface, the <code>assert_eq!</code> and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros use the operators <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>, respectively. When the assertions fail, these macros print their arguments using debug formatting, which means the values being compared must implement the <code>PartialEq</code> and <code>Debug</code> traits. All primitive types and most of the standard library types implement these traits. For structs and enums that you define yourself, you’ll need to implement <code>PartialEq</code> to assert equality of those types. You’ll also need to implement <code>Debug</code> to print the values when the assertion fails. Because both traits are derivable traits, as mentioned in Listing 5-12 in Chapter 5, this is usually as straightforward as adding the <code>#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]</code> annotation to your struct or enum definition. See Appendix C, <a href="appendix-03-derivable-traits.html">“Derivable Traits,”</a> for more details about these and other derivable traits.</p> <h3 id="adding-custom-failure-messages">Adding Custom Failure Messages</h3> <p>You can also add a custom message to be printed with the failure message as optional arguments to the <code>assert!</code>, <code>assert_eq!</code>, and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros. Any arguments specified after the required arguments are passed along to the <code>format!</code> macro (discussed in Chapter 8 in the <a href="ch08-02-strings.html#concatenation-with-the--operator-or-the-format-macro">“Concatenation with the <code>+</code> Operator or the <code>format!</code> Macro”</a> section), so you can pass a format string that contains <code>{}</code> placeholders and values to go in those placeholders. Custom messages are useful for documenting what an assertion means; when a test fails, you’ll have a better idea of what the problem is with the code.</p> <p>For example, let’s say we have a function that greets people by name and we want to test that the name we pass into the function appears in the output:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">pub fn greeting(name: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
    format!("Hello {name}!")
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn greeting_contains_name() {
        let result = greeting("Carol");
        assert!(result.contains("Carol"));
    }
}</pre> <p>The requirements for this program haven’t been agreed upon yet, and we’re pretty sure the <code>Hello</code> text at the beginning of the greeting will change. We decided we don’t want to have to update the test when the requirements change, so instead of checking for exact equality to the value returned from the <code>greeting</code> function, we’ll just assert that the output contains the text of the input parameter.</p> <p>Now let’s introduce a bug into this code by changing <code>greeting</code> to exclude <code>name</code> to see what the default test failure looks like:</p> <pre data-language="rust">pub fn greeting(name: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
    String::from("Hello!")
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn greeting_contains_name() {
        let result = greeting("Carol");
        assert!(result.contains("Carol"));
    }
}</pre> <p>Running this test produces the following:</p> <pre>$ cargo test

</h3> <p>In addition to checking return values, it’s important to check that our code handles error conditions as we expect. For example, consider the <code>Guess</code> type that we created in Chapter 9, Listing 9-13. Other code that uses <code>Guess</code> depends on the guarantee that <code>Guess</code> instances will contain only values between 1 and 100. We can write a test that ensures that attempting to create a <code>Guess</code> instance with a value outside that range panics.</p> <p>We do this by adding the attribute <code>should_panic</code> to our test function. The test passes if the code inside the function panics; the test fails if the code inside the function doesn’t panic.</p> <p>Listing 11-8 shows a test that checks that the error conditions of <code>Guess::new</code> happen when we expect them to.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">pub struct Guess {

</pre> <p>We don’t get a very helpful message in this case, but when we look at the test function, we see that it’s annotated with <code>#[should_panic]</code>. The failure we got means that the code in the test function did not cause a panic.</p> <p>Tests that use <code>should_panic</code> can be imprecise. A <code>should_panic</code> test would pass even if the test panics for a different reason from the one we were expecting. To make <code>should_panic</code> tests more precise, we can add an optional <code>expected</code> parameter to the <code>should_panic</code> attribute. The test harness will make sure that the failure message contains the provided text. For example, consider the modified code for <code>Guess</code> in Listing 11-9 where the <code>new</code> function panics with different messages depending on whether the value is too small or too large.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">pub struct Guess {

We could have specified the entire panic message that we expect, which in this case would be <code>Guess value must be less than or equal to 100, got 200</code>. What you choose to specify depends on how much of the panic message is unique or dynamic and how precise you want your test to be.

</pre> <p>The failure message indicates that this test did indeed panic as we expected, but the panic message did not include the expected string <code>less than or equal to 100</code>. The panic message that we did get in this case was <code>Guess value must be greater than or equal to 1, got 200.</code> Now we can start figuring out where our bug is!</p> <h3 id="using-resultt-e-in-tests">Using <code id="">Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> in Tests</h3> <p>Our tests so far all panic when they fail. We can also write tests that use <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>! Here’s the test from Listing 11-1, rewritten to use <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> and return an <code>Err</code> instead of panicking:</p> <pre data-language="rust">pub fn add(left: u64, right: u64) -&gt; u64 {
    left + right
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() -&gt; Result&lt;(), String&gt; {
        let result = add(2, 2);

        if result == 4 {
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err(String::from("two plus two does not equal four"))
        }
    }
}</pre> <p>The <code>it_works</code> function now has the <code>Result&lt;(), String&gt;</code> return type. In the body of the function, rather than calling the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro, we return <code>Ok(())</code> when the test passes and an <code>Err</code> with a <code>String</code> inside when the test fails.</p> <p>Writing tests so they return a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> enables you to use the question mark operator in the body of tests, which can be a convenient way to write tests that should fail if any operation within them returns an <code>Err</code> variant.</p> <p>You can’t use the <code>#[should_panic]</code> annotation on tests that use <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. To assert that an operation returns an <code>Err</code> variant, <em>don’t</em> use the question mark operator on the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> value. Instead, use <code>assert!(value.is_err())</code>.</p> <p>Now that you know several ways to write tests, let’s look at what is happening when we run our tests and explore the different options we can use with <code>cargo test</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
