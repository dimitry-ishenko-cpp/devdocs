<h1 id="building-a-single-threaded-web-server">Building a Single-Threaded Web Server</h1> <p>We’ll start by getting a single-threaded web server working. Before we begin, let’s look at a quick overview of the protocols involved in building web servers. The details of these protocols are beyond the scope of this book, but a brief overview will give you the information you need.</p> <p>The two main protocols involved in web servers are <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> <em>(HTTP)</em> and <em>Transmission Control Protocol</em> <em>(TCP)</em>. Both protocols are <em>request-response</em> protocols, meaning a <em>client</em> initiates requests and a <em>server</em> listens to the requests and provides a response to the client. The contents of those requests and responses are defined by the protocols.</p> <p>TCP is the lower-level protocol that describes the details of how information gets from one server to another but doesn’t specify what that information is. HTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents of the requests and responses. It’s technically possible to use HTTP with other protocols, but in the vast majority of cases, HTTP sends its data over TCP. We’ll work with the raw bytes of TCP and HTTP requests and responses.</p> <h3 id="listening-to-the-tcp-connection">Listening to the TCP Connection</h3> <p>Our web server needs to listen to a TCP connection, so that’s the first part we’ll work on. The standard library offers a <code>std::net</code> module that lets us do this. Let’s make a new project in the usual fashion:</p> <pre>$ cargo new hello
     Created binary (application) `hello` project
$ cd hello
</pre> <p>Now enter the code in Listing 20-1 in <em>src/main.rs</em> to start. This code will listen at the local address <code>127.0.0.1:7878</code> for incoming TCP streams. When it gets an incoming stream, it will print <code>Connection established!</code>.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::net::TcpListener;

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878").unwrap();

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        println!("Connection established!");
    }
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 20-1: Listening for incoming streams and printing a message when we receive a stream</span></p> <p>Using <code>TcpListener</code>, we can listen for TCP connections at the address <code>127.0.0.1:7878</code>. In the address, the section before the colon is an IP address representing your computer (this is the same on every computer and doesn’t represent the authors’ computer specifically), and <code>7878</code> is the port. We’ve chosen this port for two reasons: HTTP isn’t normally accepted on this port so our server is unlikely to conflict with any other web server you might have running on your machine, and 7878 is <em>rust</em> typed on a telephone.</p> <p>The <code>bind</code> function in this scenario works like the <code>new</code> function in that it will return a new <code>TcpListener</code> instance. The function is called <code>bind</code> because, in networking, connecting to a port to listen to is known as “binding to a port.”</p> <p>The <code>bind</code> function returns a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>, which indicates that it’s possible for binding to fail. For example, connecting to port 80 requires administrator privileges (nonadministrators can listen only on ports higher than 1023), so if we tried to connect to port 80 without being an administrator, binding wouldn’t work. Binding also wouldn’t work, for example, if we ran two instances of our program and so had two programs listening to the same port. Because we’re writing a basic server just for learning purposes, we won’t worry about handling these kinds of errors; instead, we use <code>unwrap</code> to stop the program if errors happen.</p> <p>The <code>incoming</code> method on <code>TcpListener</code> returns an iterator that gives us a sequence of streams (more specifically, streams of type <code>TcpStream</code>). A single <em>stream</em> represents an open connection between the client and the server. A <em>connection</em> is the name for the full request and response process in which a client connects to the server, the server generates a response, and the server closes the connection. As such, we will read from the <code>TcpStream</code> to see what the client sent and then write our response to the stream to send data back to the client. Overall, this <code>for</code> loop will process each connection in turn and produce a series of streams for us to handle.</p> <p>For now, our handling of the stream consists of calling <code>unwrap</code> to terminate our program if the stream has any errors; if there aren’t any errors, the program prints a message. We’ll add more functionality for the success case in the next listing. The reason we might receive errors from the <code>incoming</code> method when a client connects to the server is that we’re not actually iterating over connections. Instead, we’re iterating over <em>connection attempts</em>. The connection might not be successful for a number of reasons, many of them operating system specific. For example, many operating systems have a limit to the number of simultaneous open connections they can support; new connection attempts beyond that number will produce an error until some of the open connections are closed.</p> <p>Let’s try running this code! Invoke <code>cargo run</code> in the terminal and then load <em>127.0.0.1:7878</em> in a web browser. The browser should show an error message like “Connection reset,” because the server isn’t currently sending back any data. But when you look at your terminal, you should see several messages that were printed when the browser connected to the server!</p> <pre>     Running `target/debug/hello`
Connection established!
Connection established!
Connection established!
</pre> <p>Sometimes, you’ll see multiple messages printed for one browser request; the reason might be that the browser is making a request for the page as well as a request for other resources, like the <em>favicon.ico</em> icon that appears in the browser tab.</p> <p>It could also be that the browser is trying to connect to the server multiple times because the server isn’t responding with any data. When <code>stream</code> goes out of scope and is dropped at the end of the loop, the connection is closed as part of the <code>drop</code> implementation. Browsers sometimes deal with closed connections by retrying, because the problem might be temporary. The important factor is that we’ve successfully gotten a handle to a TCP connection!</p> <p>Remember to stop the program by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>c</kbd> when you’re done running a particular version of the code. Then restart the program by invoking the <code>cargo run</code> command after you’ve made each set of code changes to make sure you’re running the newest code.</p> <h3 id="reading-the-request">Reading the Request</h3> <p>Let’s implement the functionality to read the request from the browser! To separate the concerns of first getting a connection and then taking some action with the connection, we’ll start a new function for processing connections. In this new <code>handle_connection</code> function, we’ll read data from the TCP stream and print it so we can see the data being sent from the browser. Change the code to look like Listing 20-2.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::{
    io::{prelude::*, BufReader},

    for stream in listener.incoming() {

    }
}

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {

        .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())
        .collect();

    println!("Request: {http_request:#?}");
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 20-2: Reading from the <code>TcpStream</code> and printing the data</span></p> <p>We bring <code>std::io::prelude</code> and <code>std::io::BufReader</code> into scope to get access to traits and types that let us read from and write to the stream. In the <code>for</code> loop in the <code>main</code> function, instead of printing a message that says we made a connection, we now call the new <code>handle_connection</code> function and pass the <code>stream</code> to it.</p> <p>In the <code>handle_connection</code> function, we create a new <code>BufReader</code> instance that wraps a mutable reference to the <code>stream</code>. <code>BufReader</code> adds buffering by managing calls to the <code>std::io::Read</code> trait methods for us.</p> <p>We create a variable named <code>http_request</code> to collect the lines of the request the browser sends to our server. We indicate that we want to collect these lines in a vector by adding the <code>Vec&lt;_&gt;</code> type annotation.</p> <p><code>BufReader</code> implements the <code>std::io::BufRead</code> trait, which provides the <code>lines</code> method. The <code>lines</code> method returns an iterator of <code>Result&lt;String, std::io::Error&gt;</code> by splitting the stream of data whenever it sees a newline byte. To get each <code>String</code>, we map and <code>unwrap</code> each <code>Result</code>. The <code>Result</code> might be an error if the data isn’t valid UTF-8 or if there was a problem reading from the stream. Again, a production program should handle these errors more gracefully, but we’re choosing to stop the program in the error case for simplicity.</p> <p>The browser signals the end of an HTTP request by sending two newline characters in a row, so to get one request from the stream, we take lines until we get a line that is the empty string. Once we’ve collected the lines into the vector, we’re printing them out using pretty debug formatting so we can take a look at the instructions the web browser is sending to our server.</p> <p>Let’s try this code! Start the program and make a request in a web browser again. Note that we’ll still get an error page in the browser, but our program’s output in the terminal will now look similar to this:</p> <pre>$ cargo run

</pre> <p>Depending on your browser, you might get slightly different output. Now that we’re printing the request data, we can see why we get multiple connections from one browser request by looking at the path after <code>GET</code> in the first line of the request. If the repeated connections are all requesting <em>/</em>, we know the browser is trying to fetch <em>/</em> repeatedly because it’s not getting a response from our program.</p> <p>Let’s break down this request data to understand what the browser is asking of our program.</p> <h3 id="a-closer-look-at-an-http-request">A Closer Look at an HTTP Request</h3> <p>HTTP is a text-based protocol, and a request takes this format:</p> <pre>Method Request-URI HTTP-Version CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body
</pre> <p>The first line is the <em>request line</em> that holds information about what the client is requesting. The first part of the request line indicates the <em>method</em> being used, such as <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>, which describes how the client is making this request. Our client used a <code>GET</code> request, which means it is asking for information.</p> <p>The next part of the request line is <em>/</em>, which indicates the <em>Uniform Resource Identifier</em> <em>(URI)</em> the client is requesting: a URI is almost, but not quite, the same as a <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em> <em>(URL)</em>. The difference between URIs and URLs isn’t important for our purposes in this chapter, but the HTTP spec uses the term URI, so we can just mentally substitute URL for URI here.</p> <p>The last part is the HTTP version the client uses, and then the request line ends in a <em>CRLF sequence</em>. (CRLF stands for <em>carriage return</em> and <em>line feed</em>, which are terms from the typewriter days!) The CRLF sequence can also be written as <code>\r\n</code>, where <code>\r</code> is a carriage return and <code>\n</code> is a line feed. The CRLF sequence separates the request line from the rest of the request data. Note that when the CRLF is printed, we see a new line start rather than <code>\r\n</code>.</p> <p>Looking at the request line data we received from running our program so far, we see that <code>GET</code> is the method, <em>/</em> is the request URI, and <code>HTTP/1.1</code> is the version.</p> <p>After the request line, the remaining lines starting from <code>Host:</code> onward are headers. <code>GET</code> requests have no body.</p> <p>Try making a request from a different browser or asking for a different address, such as <em>127.0.0.1:7878/test</em>, to see how the request data changes.</p> <p>Now that we know what the browser is asking for, let’s send back some data!</p> <h3 id="writing-a-response">Writing a Response</h3> <p>We’re going to implement sending data in response to a client request. Responses have the following format:</p> <pre>HTTP-Version Status-Code Reason-Phrase CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body
</pre> <p>The first line is a <em>status line</em> that contains the HTTP version used in the response, a numeric status code that summarizes the result of the request, and a reason phrase that provides a text description of the status code. After the CRLF sequence are any headers, another CRLF sequence, and the body of the response.</p> <p>Here is an example response that uses HTTP version 1.1, has a status code of 200, an OK reason phrase, no headers, and no body:</p> <pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
</pre> <p>The status code 200 is the standard success response. The text is a tiny successful HTTP response. Let’s write this to the stream as our response to a successful request! From the <code>handle_connection</code> function, remove the <code>println!</code> that was printing the request data and replace it with the code in Listing 20-3.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::{

The <code>write_all</code> method on <code>stream</code> takes a <code>&amp;[u8]</code> and sends those bytes directly down the connection. Because the <code>write_all</code> operation could fail, we use <code>unwrap</code> on any error result as before. Again, in a real application you would add error handling here.</p> <p>With these changes, let’s run our code and make a request. We’re no longer printing any data to the terminal, so we won’t see any output other than the output from Cargo. When you load <em>127.0.0.1:7878</em> in a web browser, you should get a blank page instead of an error.

}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 20-9: Refactoring the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks to contain only the code that differs between the two cases</span></p> <p>Now the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks only return the appropriate values for the status line and filename in a tuple; we then use destructuring to assign these two values to <code>status_line</code> and <code>filename</code> using a pattern in the <code>let</code> statement, as discussed in Chapter 18.</p> <p>The previously duplicated code is now outside the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks and uses the <code>status_line</code> and <code>filename</code> variables. This makes it easier to see the difference between the two cases, and it means we have only one place to update the code if we want to change how the file reading and response writing work. The behavior of the code in Listing 20-9 will be the same as that in Listing 20-7.</p> <p>Awesome! We now have a simple web server in approximately 40 lines of Rust code that responds to one request with a page of content and responds to all other requests with a 404 response.</p> <p>Currently, our server runs in a single thread, meaning it can only serve one request at a time. Let’s examine how that can be a problem by simulating some slow requests. Then we’ll fix it so our server can handle multiple requests at once.</p><div class="_attribution">
