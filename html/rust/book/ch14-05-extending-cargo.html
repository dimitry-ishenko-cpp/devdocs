<h1 id="extending-cargo-with-custom-commands">Extending Cargo with Custom Commands</h1> <p>Cargo is designed so you can extend it with new subcommands without having to modify Cargo. If a binary in your <code>$PATH</code> is named <code>cargo-something</code>, you can run it as if it was a Cargo subcommand by running <code>cargo something</code>. Custom commands like this are also listed when you run <code>cargo --list</code>. Being able to use <code>cargo install</code> to install extensions and then run them just like the built-in Cargo tools is a super convenient benefit of Cargo’s design!</p> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>Sharing code with Cargo and <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> is part of what makes the Rust ecosystem useful for many different tasks. Rust’s standard library is small and stable, but crates are easy to share, use, and improve on a timeline different from that of the language. Don’t be shy about sharing code that’s useful to you on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>; it’s likely that it will be useful to someone else as well!</p><div class="_attribution">
