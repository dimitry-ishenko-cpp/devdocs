<h1 id="validating-references-with-lifetimes">Validating References with Lifetimes</h1> <p>Lifetimes are another kind of generic that we’ve already been using. Rather than ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes ensure that references are valid as long as we need them to be.</p> <p>One detail we didn’t discuss in the <a href="ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#references-and-borrowing">“References and Borrowing”</a> section in Chapter 4 is that every reference in Rust has a <em>lifetime</em>, which is the scope for which that reference is valid. Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred, just like most of the time, types are inferred. We must only annotate types when multiple types are possible. In a similar way, we must annotate lifetimes when the lifetimes of references could be related in a few different ways. Rust requires us to annotate the relationships using generic lifetime parameters to ensure the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid.</p> <p>Annotating lifetimes is not a concept most other programming languages have, so this is going to feel unfamiliar. Although we won’t cover lifetimes in their entirety in this chapter, we’ll discuss common ways you might encounter lifetime syntax so you can get comfortable with the concept.</p> <h3 id="preventing-dangling-references-with-lifetimes">Preventing Dangling References with Lifetimes</h3> <p>The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent <em>dangling references</em>, which cause a program to reference data other than the data it’s intended to reference.

    let r;

</pre> <p>The variable <code>x</code> doesn’t “live long enough.” The reason is that <code>x</code> will be out of scope when the inner scope ends on line 7. But <code>r</code> is still valid for the outer scope; because its scope is larger, we say that it “lives longer.” If Rust allowed this code to work, <code>r</code> would be referencing memory that was deallocated when <code>x</code> went out of scope, and anything we tried to do with <code>r</code> wouldn’t work correctly. So how does Rust determine that this code is invalid? It uses a borrow checker.</p> <h3 id="the-borrow-checker">The Borrow Checker</h3> <p>The Rust compiler has a <em>borrow checker</em> that compares scopes to determine whether all borrows are valid.

</pre> <p>The help text reveals that the return type needs a generic lifetime parameter on it because Rust can’t tell whether the reference being returned refers to <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>. Actually, we don’t know either, because the <code>if</code> block in the body of this function returns a reference to <code>x</code> and the <code>else</code> block returns a reference to <code>y</code>!</p> <p>When we’re defining this function, we don’t know the concrete values that will be passed into this function, so we don’t know whether the <code>if</code> case or the <code>else</code> case will execute. We also don’t know the concrete lifetimes of the references that will be passed in, so we can’t look at the scopes as we did in Listings 10-17 and 10-18 to determine whether the reference we return will always be valid. The borrow checker can’t determine this either, because it doesn’t know how the lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> relate to the lifetime of the return value. To fix this error, we’ll add generic lifetime parameters that define the relationship between the references so the borrow checker can perform its analysis.</p> <h3 id="lifetime-annotation-syntax">Lifetime Annotation Syntax</h3> <p>Lifetime annotations don’t change how long any of the references live. Rather, they describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other without affecting the lifetimes. Just as functions can accept any type when the signature specifies a generic type parameter, functions can accept references with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter.</p> <p>Lifetime annotations have a slightly unusual syntax: the names of lifetime parameters must start with an apostrophe (<code>'</code>) and are usually all lowercase and very short, like generic types. Most people use the name <code>'a</code> for the first lifetime annotation. We place lifetime parameter annotations after the <code>&amp;</code> of a reference, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference’s type.</p> <p>Here are some examples: a reference to an <code>i32</code> without a lifetime parameter, a reference to an <code>i32</code> that has a lifetime parameter named <code>'a</code>, and a mutable reference to an <code>i32</code> that also has the lifetime <code>'a</code>.</p> <pre data-language="rust">&amp;i32        // a reference
&amp;'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&amp;'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime</pre> <p>One lifetime annotation by itself doesn’t have much meaning, because the annotations are meant to tell Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple references relate to each other. Let’s examine how the lifetime annotations relate to each other in the context of the <code>longest</code> function.</p> <h3 id="lifetime-annotations-in-function-signatures">Lifetime Annotations in Function Signatures</h3> <p>To use lifetime annotations in function signatures, we need to declare the generic <em>lifetime</em> parameters inside angle brackets between the function name and the parameter list, just as we did with generic <em>type</em> parameters.</p> <p>We want the signature to express the following constraint: the returned reference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid. This is the relationship between lifetimes of the parameters and the return value. We’ll name the lifetime <code>'a</code> and then add it to each reference, as shown in Listing 10-21.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {

The function signature also tells Rust that the string slice returned from the function will live at least as long as lifetime <code>'a</code>. In practice, it means that the lifetime of the reference returned by the <code>longest</code> function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the values referred to by the function arguments. These relationships are what we want Rust to use when analyzing this code.</p> <p>Remember, when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature, we’re not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned. Rather, we’re specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don’t adhere to these constraints. Note that the <code>longest</code> function doesn’t need to know exactly how long <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will live, only that some scope can be substituted for <code>'a</code> that will satisfy this signature.</p> <p>When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function signature, not in the function body. The lifetime annotations become part of the contract of the function, much like the types in the signature. Having function signatures contain the lifetime contract means the analysis the Rust compiler does can be simpler. If there’s a problem with the way a function is annotated or the way it is called, the compiler errors can point to the part of our code and the constraints more precisely. If, instead, the Rust compiler made more inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes to be, the compiler might only be able to point to a use of our code many steps away from the cause of the problem.</p> <p>When we pass concrete references to <code>longest</code>, the concrete lifetime that is substituted for <code>'a</code> is the part of the scope of <code>x</code> that overlaps with the scope of <code>y</code>. In other words, the generic lifetime <code>'a</code> will get the concrete lifetime that is equal to the smaller of the lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Because we’ve annotated the returned reference with the same lifetime parameter <code>'a</code>, the returned reference will also be valid for the length of the smaller of the lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p> <p>Let’s look at how the lifetime annotations restrict the <code>longest</code> function by passing in references that have different concrete lifetimes.

However, the compiler can’t see that the reference is valid in this case. We’ve told Rust that the lifetime of the reference returned by the <code>longest</code> function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the references passed in. Therefore, the borrow checker disallows the code in Listing 10-23 as possibly having an invalid reference.</p> <p>Try designing more experiments that vary the values and lifetimes of the references passed in to the <code>longest</code> function and how the returned reference is used.

</pre> <p>The problem is that <code>result</code> goes out of scope and gets cleaned up at the end of the <code>longest</code> function. We’re also trying to return a reference to <code>result</code> from the function. There is no way we can specify lifetime parameters that would change the dangling reference, and Rust won’t let us create a dangling reference. In this case, the best fix would be to return an owned data type rather than a reference so the calling function is then responsible for cleaning up the value.</p> <p>Ultimately, lifetime syntax is about connecting the lifetimes of various parameters and return values of functions.

These aren’t rules for programmers to follow; they’re a set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your code fits these cases, you don’t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.</p> <p>The elision rules don’t provide full inference. If Rust deterministically applies the rules but there is still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the references have, the compiler won’t guess what the lifetime of the remaining references should be. Instead of guessing, the compiler will give you an error that you can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations.</p> <p>Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called <em>input lifetimes</em>, and lifetimes on return values are called <em>output lifetimes</em>.</p> <p>The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references when there aren’t explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input lifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes. If the compiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for which it can’t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error. These rules apply to <code>fn</code> definitions as well as <code>impl</code> blocks.</p> <p>The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each parameter that’s a reference. In other words, a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter: <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32)</code>; a function with two parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: <code>fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32, y: &amp;'b i32)</code>; and so on.</p> <p>The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32) -&gt; &amp;'a i32</code>.</p> <p>The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is <code>&amp;self</code> or <code>&amp;mut self</code> because this is a method, the lifetime of <code>self</code> is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.</p> <p>Let’s pretend we’re the compiler. We’ll apply these rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references in the signature of the <code>first_word</code> function in Listing 10-25. The signature starts without any lifetimes associated with the references:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn first_word(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {</pre> <p>Then the compiler applies the first rule, which specifies that each parameter gets its own lifetime. We’ll call it <code>'a</code> as usual, so now the signature is this:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;str {</pre> <p>The second rule applies because there is exactly one input lifetime. The second rule specifies that the lifetime of the one input parameter gets assigned to the output lifetime, so the signature is now this:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {</pre> <p>Now all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and the compiler can continue its analysis without needing the programmer to annotate the lifetimes in this function signature.</p> <p>Let’s look at another example, this time using the <code>longest</code> function that had no lifetime parameters when we started working with it in Listing 10-20:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn longest(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {</pre> <p>Let’s apply the first rule: each parameter gets its own lifetime. This time we have two parameters instead of one, so we have two lifetimes:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn longest&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'b str) -&gt; &amp;str {</pre> <p>You can see that the second rule doesn’t apply because there is more than one input lifetime. The third rule doesn’t apply either, because <code>longest</code> is a function rather than a method, so none of the parameters are <code>self</code>. After working through all three rules, we still haven’t figured out what the return type’s lifetime is. This is why we got an error trying to compile the code in Listing 10-20: the compiler worked through the lifetime elision rules but still couldn’t figure out all the lifetimes of the references in the signature.</p> <p>Because the third rule really only applies in method signatures, we’ll look at lifetimes in that context next to see why the third rule means we don’t have to annotate lifetimes in method signatures very often.</p> <h3 id="lifetime-annotations-in-method-definitions">Lifetime Annotations in Method Definitions</h3> <p>When we implement methods on a struct with lifetimes, we use the same syntax as that of generic type parameters shown in Listing 10-11. Where we declare and use the lifetime parameters depends on whether they’re related to the struct fields or the method parameters and return values.</p> <p>Lifetime names for struct fields always need to be declared after the <code>impl</code> keyword and then used after the struct’s name, because those lifetimes are part of the struct’s type.</p> <p>In method signatures inside the <code>impl</code> block, references might be tied to the lifetime of references in the struct’s fields, or they might be independent. In addition, the lifetime elision rules often make it so that lifetime annotations aren’t necessary in method signatures. Let’s look at some examples using the struct named <code>ImportantExcerpt</code> that we defined in Listing 10-24.</p> <p>First, we’ll use a method named <code>level</code> whose only parameter is a reference to <code>self</code> and whose return value is an <code>i32</code>, which is not a reference to anything:</p> <pre data-language="rust">struct ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
    part: &amp;'a str,
}

impl&lt;'a&gt; ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
    fn level(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 {
        3
    }
}

impl&lt;'a&gt; ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
    fn announce_and_return_part(&amp;self, announcement: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
        println!("Attention please: {}", announcement);
        self.part
    }
}

fn main() {
    let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
    let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().expect("Could not find a '.'");
    let i = ImportantExcerpt {
        part: first_sentence,
    };
}</pre> <p>The lifetime parameter declaration after <code>impl</code> and its use after the type name are required, but we’re not required to annotate the lifetime of the reference to <code>self</code> because of the first elision rule.</p> <p>Here is an example where the third lifetime elision rule applies:</p> <pre data-language="rust">struct ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
    part: &amp;'a str,
}

impl&lt;'a&gt; ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
    fn level(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 {
        3
    }
}

impl&lt;'a&gt; ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
    fn announce_and_return_part(&amp;self, announcement: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
        println!("Attention please: {}", announcement);
        self.part
    }
}

fn main() {
    let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
    let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().expect("Could not find a '.'");
    let i = ImportantExcerpt {
        part: first_sentence,
    };
}</pre> <p>There are two input lifetimes, so Rust applies the first lifetime elision rule and gives both <code>&amp;self</code> and <code>announcement</code> their own lifetimes. Then, because one of the parameters is <code>&amp;self</code>, the return type gets the lifetime of <code>&amp;self</code>, and all lifetimes have been accounted for.</p> <h3 id="the-static-lifetime">The Static Lifetime</h3> <p>One special lifetime we need to discuss is <code>'static</code>, which denotes that the affected reference <em>can</em> live for the entire duration of the program. All string literals have the <code>'static</code> lifetime, which we can annotate as follows:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let s: &amp;'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
}</pre> <p>The text of this string is stored directly in the program’s binary, which is always available. Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is <code>'static</code>.</p> <p>You might see suggestions to use the <code>'static</code> lifetime in error messages. But before specifying <code>'static</code> as the lifetime for a reference, think about whether the reference you have actually lives the entire lifetime of your program or not, and whether you want it to. Most of the time, an error message suggesting the <code>'static</code> lifetime results from attempting to create a dangling reference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes. In such cases, the solution is fixing those problems, not specifying the <code>'static</code> lifetime.</p> <h2 id="generic-type-parameters-trait-bounds-and-lifetimes-together">Generic Type Parameters, Trait Bounds, and Lifetimes Together</h2> <p>Let’s briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type parameters, trait bounds, and lifetimes all in one function!</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("abcd");
    let string2 = "xyz";

    let result = longest_with_an_announcement(
        string1.as_str(),
        string2,
        "Today is someone's birthday!",
    );
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}

use std::fmt::Display;

fn longest_with_an_announcement&lt;'a, T&gt;(
    x: &amp;'a str,
    y: &amp;'a str,
    ann: T,
) -&gt; &amp;'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
    println!("Announcement! {}", ann);
    if x.len() &gt; y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}</pre> <p>This is the <code>longest</code> function from Listing 10-21 that returns the longer of two string slices. But now it has an extra parameter named <code>ann</code> of the generic type <code>T</code>, which can be filled in by any type that implements the <code>Display</code> trait as specified by the <code>where</code> clause. This extra parameter will be printed using <code>{}</code>, which is why the <code>Display</code> trait bound is necessary. Because lifetimes are a type of generic, the declarations of the lifetime parameter <code>'a</code> and the generic type parameter <code>T</code> go in the same list inside the angle brackets after the function name.</p> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>We covered a lot in this chapter! Now that you know about generic type parameters, traits and trait bounds, and generic lifetime parameters, you’re ready to write code without repetition that works in many different situations. Generic type parameters let you apply the code to different types. Traits and trait bounds ensure that even though the types are generic, they’ll have the behavior the code needs. You learned how to use lifetime annotations to ensure that this flexible code won’t have any dangling references. And all of this analysis happens at compile time, which doesn’t affect runtime performance!</p> <p>Believe it or not, there is much more to learn on the topics we discussed in this chapter: Chapter 17 discusses trait objects, which are another way to use traits. There are also more complex scenarios involving lifetime annotations that you will only need in very advanced scenarios; for those, you should read the <a href="../reference/index.html">Rust Reference</a>. But next, you’ll learn how to write tests in Rust so you can make sure your code is working the way it should.</p><div class="_attribution">
