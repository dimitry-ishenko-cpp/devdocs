<h1 id="hello-world">Hello, World!</h1> <p>Now that you’ve installed Rust, it’s time to write your first Rust program. It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that prints the text <code>Hello, world!</code> to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!</p> <section class="note" aria-role="note"> <p>Note: This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line. Rust makes no specific demands about your editing or tooling or where your code lives, so if you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) instead of the command line, feel free to use your favorite IDE. Many IDEs now have some degree of Rust support; check the IDE’s documentation for details. The Rust team has been focusing on enabling great IDE support via <code>rust-analyzer</code>. See <a href="appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html">Appendix D</a> for more details.</p> </section> <h3 id="creating-a-project-directory">Creating a Project Directory</h3> <p>You’ll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn’t matter to Rust where your code lives, but for the exercises and projects in this book, we suggest making a <em>projects</em> directory in your home directory and keeping all your projects there.</p> <p>Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a <em>projects</em> directory and a directory for the “Hello, world!” project within the <em>projects</em> directory.</p> <p>For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:</p> <pre>$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
</pre> <p>For Windows CMD, enter this:</p> <pre>&gt; mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
&gt; cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
&gt; mkdir hello_world
&gt; cd hello_world
</pre> <h3 id="writing-and-running-a-rust-program">Writing and Running a Rust Program</h3> <p>Next, make a new source file and call it <em>main.rs</em>. Rust files always end with the <em>.rs</em> extension. If you’re using more than one word in your filename, the convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example, use <em>hello_world.rs</em> rather than <em>helloworld.rs</em>.</p> <p>Now open the <em>main.rs</em> file you just created and enter the code in Listing 1-1.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: main.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 1-1: A program that prints <code>Hello, world!</code></figcaption> </figure> <p>Save the file and go back to your terminal window in the <em>~/projects/hello_world</em> directory. On Linux or macOS, enter the following commands to compile and run the file:</p> <pre>$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
</pre> <p>On Windows, enter the command <code>.\main.exe</code> instead of <code>./main</code>:</p> <pre>&gt; rustc main.rs
&gt; .\main.exe
Hello, world!
</pre> <p>Regardless of your operating system, the string <code>Hello, world!</code> should print to the terminal. If you don’t see this output, refer back to the <a href="ch01-01-installation.html#troubleshooting">“Troubleshooting”</a> part of the Installation section for ways to get help.</p> <p>If <code>Hello, world!</code> did print, congratulations! You’ve officially written a Rust program. That makes you a Rust programmer—welcome!</p> <h3 id="anatomy-of-a-rust-program">Anatomy of a Rust Program</h3> <p>Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of the puzzle:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {

}</pre> <p>These lines define a function named <code>main</code>. The <code>main</code> function is special: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program. Here, the first line declares a function named <code>main</code> that has no parameters and returns nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses <code>()</code>.</p> <p>The function body is wrapped in <code>{}</code>. Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies. It’s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.</p> <section class="note" aria-role="note"> <p>Note: If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can use an automatic formatter tool called <code>rustfmt</code> to format your code in a particular style (more on <code>rustfmt</code> in <a href="appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html">Appendix D</a>). The Rust team has included this tool with the standard Rust distribution, as <code>rustc</code> is, so it should already be installed on your computer!</p> </section> <p>The body of the <code>main</code> function holds the following code:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
println!("Hello, world!");
}</pre> <p>This line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to the screen. There are four important details to notice here.</p> <p>First, <code>println!</code> calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it would be entered as <code>println</code> (without the <code>!</code>). We’ll discuss Rust macros in more detail in Chapter 20. For now, you just need to know that using a <code>!</code> means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function and that macros don’t always follow the same rules as functions.</p> <p>Second, you see the <code>"Hello, world!"</code> string. We pass this string as an argument to <code>println!</code>, and the string is printed to the screen.</p> <p>Third, we end the line with a semicolon (<code>;</code>), which indicates that this expression is over and the next one is ready to begin. Most lines of Rust code end with a semicolon.</p> <h3 id="compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps">Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps</h3> <p>You’ve just run a newly created program, so let’s examine each step in the process.</p> <p>Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by entering the <code>rustc</code> command and passing it the name of your source file, like this:</p> <pre>$ rustc main.rs
</pre> <p>If you have a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>. After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.</p> <p>On Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, you can see the executable by entering the <code>ls</code> command in your shell:</p> <pre>$ ls
main  main.rs
</pre> <p>On Linux and macOS, you’ll see two files. With PowerShell on Windows, you’ll see the same three files that you would see using CMD. With CMD on Windows, you would enter the following:</p> <pre>&gt; dir /B %= the /B option says to only show the file names =%
main.exe
main.pdb
main.rs
</pre> <p>This shows the source code file with the <em>.rs</em> extension, the executable file (<em>main.exe</em> on Windows, but <em>main</em> on all other platforms), and, when using Windows, a file containing debugging information with the <em>.pdb</em> extension. From here, you run the <em>main</em> or <em>main.exe</em> file, like this:</p> <pre>$ ./main # or .\main.exe on Windows
</pre> <p>If your <em>main.rs</em> is your “Hello, world!” program, this line prints <code>Hello, world!</code> to your terminal.</p> <p>If you’re more familiar with a dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python, or JavaScript, you might not be used to compiling and running a program as separate steps. Rust is an <em>ahead-of-time compiled</em> language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed. If you give someone a <em>.rb</em>, <em>.py</em>, or <em>.js</em> file, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation installed (respectively). But in those languages, you only need one command to compile and run your program. Everything is a trade-off in language design.</p> <p>Just compiling with <code>rustc</code> is fine for simple programs, but as your project grows, you’ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your code. Next, we’ll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write real-world Rust programs.</p><div class="_attribution">
