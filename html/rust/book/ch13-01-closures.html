 <h2 id="closures-anonymous-functions-that-capture-their-environment">Closures: Anonymous Functions that Capture Their Environment</h2> <p>Rust’s closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions. You can create the closure in one place and then call the closure elsewhere to evaluate it in a different context. Unlike functions, closures can capture values from the scope in which they’re defined. We’ll demonstrate how these closure features allow for code reuse and behavior customization.</p>   <h3 id="capturing-the-environment-with-closures">Capturing the Environment with Closures</h3> <p>We’ll first examine how we can use closures to capture values from the environment they’re defined in for later use. Here’s the scenario: Every so often, our t-shirt company gives away an exclusive, limited-edition shirt to someone on our mailing list as a promotion. People on the mailing list can optionally add their favorite color to their profile. If the person chosen for a free shirt has their favorite color set, they get that color shirt. If the person hasn’t specified a favorite color, they get whatever color the company currently has the most of.</p> <p>There are many ways to implement this. For this example, we’re going to use an enum called <code>ShirtColor</code> that has the variants <code>Red</code> and <code>Blue</code> (limiting the number of colors available for simplicity). We represent the company’s inventory with an <code>Inventory</code> struct that has a field named <code>shirts</code> that contains a <code>Vec&lt;ShirtColor&gt;</code> representing the shirt colors currently in stock. The method <code>giveaway</code> defined on <code>Inventory</code> gets the optional shirt color preference of the free shirt winner, and returns the shirt color the person will get. This setup is shown in Listing 13-1:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Copy, Clone)]
enum ShirtColor {
    Red,
    Blue,
}

struct Inventory {
    shirts: Vec&lt;ShirtColor&gt;,
}

impl Inventory {
    fn giveaway(&amp;self, user_preference: Option&lt;ShirtColor&gt;) -&gt; ShirtColor {
        user_preference.unwrap_or_else(|| self.most_stocked())
    }

    fn most_stocked(&amp;self) -&gt; ShirtColor {
        let mut num_red = 0;
        let mut num_blue = 0;

        for color in &amp;self.shirts {
            match color {
                ShirtColor::Red =&gt; num_red += 1,
                ShirtColor::Blue =&gt; num_blue += 1,
            }
        }
        if num_red &gt; num_blue {
            ShirtColor::Red
        } else {
            ShirtColor::Blue
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let store = Inventory {
        shirts: vec![ShirtColor::Blue, ShirtColor::Red, ShirtColor::Blue],
    };

    let user_pref1 = Some(ShirtColor::Red);
    let giveaway1 = store.giveaway(user_pref1);
    println!(
        "The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}",
        user_pref1, giveaway1
    );

    let user_pref2 = None;
    let giveaway2 = store.giveaway(user_pref2);
    println!(
        "The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}",
        user_pref2, giveaway2
    );
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 13-1: Shirt company giveaway situation</span></p> <p>The <code>store</code> defined in <code>main</code> has two blue shirts and one red shirt remaining to distribute for this limited-edition promotion. We call the <code>giveaway</code> method for a user with a preference for a red shirt and a user without any preference.</p> <p>Again, this code could be implemented in many ways, and here, to focus on closures, we’ve stuck to concepts you’ve already learned except for the body of the <code>giveaway</code> method that uses a closure. In the <code>giveaway</code> method, we get the user preference as a parameter of type <code>Option&lt;ShirtColor&gt;</code> and call the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> method on <code>user_preference</code>. The <a href="../std/option/enum.option.html#method.unwrap_or_else"><code>unwrap_or_else</code> method on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is defined by the standard library. It takes one argument: a closure without any arguments that returns a value <code>T</code> (the same type stored in the <code>Some</code> variant of the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, in this case <code>ShirtColor</code>). If the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is the <code>Some</code> variant, <code>unwrap_or_else</code> returns the value from within the <code>Some</code>. If the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is the <code>None</code> variant, <code>unwrap_or_else</code> calls the closure and returns the value returned by the closure.</p> <p>We specify the closure expression <code>|| self.most_stocked()</code> as the argument to <code>unwrap_or_else</code>. This is a closure that takes no parameters itself (if the closure had parameters, they would appear between the two vertical bars). The body of the closure calls <code>self.most_stocked()</code>. We’re defining the closure here, and the implementation of <code>unwrap_or_else</code> will evaluate the closure later if the result is needed.</p> <p>Running this code prints:</p> <pre>$ cargo run

</pre> <p>One interesting aspect here is that we’ve passed a closure that calls <code>self.most_stocked()</code> on the current <code>Inventory</code> instance. The standard library didn’t need to know anything about the <code>Inventory</code> or <code>ShirtColor</code> types we defined, or the logic we want to use in this scenario. The closure captures an immutable reference to the <code>self</code> <code>Inventory</code> instance and passes it with the code we specify to the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> method. Functions, on the other hand, are not able to capture their environment in this way.</p> <h3 id="closure-type-inference-and-annotation">Closure Type Inference and Annotation</h3> <p>There are more differences between functions and closures. Closures don’t usually require you to annotate the types of the parameters or the return value like <code>fn</code> functions do. Type annotations are required on functions because the types are part of an explicit interface exposed to your users. Defining this interface rigidly is important for ensuring that everyone agrees on what types of values a function uses and returns. Closures, on the other hand, aren’t used in an exposed interface like this: they’re stored in variables and used without naming them and exposing them to users of our library.</p> <p>Closures are typically short and relevant only within a narrow context rather than in any arbitrary scenario. Within these limited contexts, the compiler can infer the types of the parameters and the return type, similar to how it’s able to infer the types of most variables (there are rare cases where the compiler needs closure type annotations too).</p> <p>As with variables, we can add type annotations if we want to increase explicitness and clarity at the cost of being more verbose than is strictly necessary. Annotating the types for a closure would look like the definition shown in Listing 13-2. In this example, we’re defining a closure and storing it in a variable rather than defining the closure in the spot we pass it as an argument as we did in Listing 13-1.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::thread;

}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 13-2: Adding optional type annotations of the parameter and return value types in the closure</span></p> <p>With type annotations added, the syntax of closures looks more similar to the syntax of functions. Here we define a function that adds 1 to its parameter and a closure that has the same behavior, for comparison. We’ve added some spaces to line up the relevant parts. This illustrates how closure syntax is similar to function syntax except for the use of pipes and the amount of syntax that is optional:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -&gt; u32 { x + 1 }
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -&gt; u32 { x + 1 };
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;</pre> <p>The first line shows a function definition, and the second line shows a fully annotated closure definition. In the third line, we remove the type annotations from the closure definition. In the fourth line, we remove the brackets, which are optional because the closure body has only one expression. These are all valid definitions that will produce the same behavior when they’re called. The <code>add_one_v3</code> and <code>add_one_v4</code> lines require the closures to be evaluated to be able to compile because the types will be inferred from their usage. This is similar to <code>let v = Vec::new();</code> needing either type annotations or values of some type to be inserted into the <code>Vec</code> for Rust to be able to infer the type.</p> <p>For closure definitions, the compiler will infer one concrete type for each of their parameters and for their return value. For instance, Listing 13-3 shows the definition of a short closure that just returns the value it receives as a parameter. This closure isn’t very useful except for the purposes of this example. Note that we haven’t added any type annotations to the definition.

We don’t use the closure again after the closure is called, so the mutable borrow ends. Between the closure definition and the closure call, an immutable borrow to print isn’t allowed because no other borrows are allowed when there’s a mutable borrow. Try adding a <code>println!</code> there to see what error message you get!</p> <p>If you want to force the closure to take ownership of the values it uses in the environment even though the body of the closure doesn’t strictly need ownership, you can use the <code>move</code> keyword before the parameter list.</p> <p>This technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread to move the data so that it’s owned by the new thread. We’ll discuss threads and why you would want to use them in detail in Chapter 16 when we talk about concurrency, but for now, let’s briefly explore spawning a new thread using a closure that needs the <code>move</code> keyword. Listing 13-6 shows Listing 13-4 modified to print the vector in a new thread rather than in the main thread:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {list:?}");

    thread::spawn(move || println!("From thread: {list:?}"))
        .join()
        .unwrap();
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 13-6: Using <code>move</code> to force the closure for the thread to take ownership of <code>list</code></span></p> <p>We spawn a new thread, giving the thread a closure to run as an argument. The closure body prints out the list. In Listing 13-4, the closure only captured <code>list</code> using an immutable reference because that’s the least amount of access to <code>list</code> needed to print it. In this example, even though the closure body still only needs an immutable reference, we need to specify that <code>list</code> should be moved into the closure by putting the <code>move</code> keyword at the beginning of the closure definition. The new thread might finish before the rest of the main thread finishes, or the main thread might finish first. If the main thread maintained ownership of <code>list</code> but ended before the new thread did and dropped <code>list</code>, the immutable reference in the thread would be invalid. Therefore, the compiler requires that <code>list</code> be moved into the closure given to the new thread so the reference will be valid. Try removing the <code>move</code> keyword or using <code>list</code> in the main thread after the closure is defined to see what compiler errors you get!</p>   <h3 id="moving-captured-values-out-of-closures-and-the-fn-traits">Moving Captured Values Out of Closures and the <code id="">Fn</code> Traits</h3> <p>Once a closure has captured a reference or captured ownership of a value from the environment where the closure is defined (thus affecting what, if anything, is moved <em>into</em> the closure), the code in the body of the closure defines what happens to the references or values when the closure is evaluated later (thus affecting what, if anything, is moved <em>out of</em> the closure). A closure body can do any of the following: move a captured value out of the closure, mutate the captured value, neither move nor mutate the value, or capture nothing from the environment to begin with.</p> <p>The way a closure captures and handles values from the environment affects which traits the closure implements, and traits are how functions and structs can specify what kinds of closures they can use. Closures will automatically implement one, two, or all three of these <code>Fn</code> traits, in an additive fashion, depending on how the closure’s body handles the values:</p> <ol> <li>
<code>FnOnce</code> applies to closures that can be called once. All closures implement at least this trait, because all closures can be called. A closure that moves captured values out of its body will only implement <code>FnOnce</code> and none of the other <code>Fn</code> traits, because it can only be called once.</li> <li>
<code>FnMut</code> applies to closures that don’t move captured values out of their body, but that might mutate the captured values. These closures can be called more than once.</li> <li>
<code>Fn</code> applies to closures that don’t move captured values out of their body and that don’t mutate captured values, as well as closures that capture nothing from their environment. These closures can be called more than once without mutating their environment, which is important in cases such as calling a closure multiple times concurrently.</li> </ol> <p>Let’s look at the definition of the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> method on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> that we used in Listing 13-1:</p> <pre data-language="rust">impl&lt;T&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
    pub fn unwrap_or_else&lt;F&gt;(self, f: F) -&gt; T
    where
        F: FnOnce() -&gt; T
    {
        match self {
            Some(x) =&gt; x,
            None =&gt; f(),
        }
    }
}</pre> <p>Recall that <code>T</code> is the generic type representing the type of the value in the <code>Some</code> variant of an <code>Option</code>. That type <code>T</code> is also the return type of the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> function: code that calls <code>unwrap_or_else</code> on an <code>Option&lt;String&gt;</code>, for example, will get a <code>String</code>.</p> <p>Next, notice that the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> function has the additional generic type parameter <code>F</code>. The <code>F</code> type is the type of the parameter named <code>f</code>, which is the closure we provide when calling <code>unwrap_or_else</code>.</p> <p>The trait bound specified on the generic type <code>F</code> is <code>FnOnce() -&gt; T</code>, which means <code>F</code> must be able to be called once, take no arguments, and return a <code>T</code>. Using <code>FnOnce</code> in the trait bound expresses the constraint that <code>unwrap_or_else</code> is only going to call <code>f</code> at most one time. In the body of <code>unwrap_or_else</code>, we can see that if the <code>Option</code> is <code>Some</code>, <code>f</code> won’t be called. If the <code>Option</code> is <code>None</code>, <code>f</code> will be called once. Because all closures implement <code>FnOnce</code>, <code>unwrap_or_else</code> accepts all three kinds of closures and is as flexible as it can be.</p> <section class="note" aria-role="note"> <p>Note: Functions can implement all three of the <code>Fn</code> traits too. If what we want to do doesn’t require capturing a value from the environment, we can use the name of a function rather than a closure where we need something that implements one of the <code>Fn</code> traits. For example, on an <code>Option&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> value, we could call <code>unwrap_or_else(Vec::new)</code> to get a new, empty vector if the value is <code>None</code>.</p> </section> <p>Now let’s look at the standard library method <code>sort_by_key</code> defined on slices, to see how that differs from <code>unwrap_or_else</code> and why <code>sort_by_key</code> uses <code>FnMut</code> instead of <code>FnOnce</code> for the trait bound. The closure gets one argument in the form of a reference to the current item in the slice being considered, and returns a value of type <code>K</code> that can be ordered. This function is useful when you want to sort a slice by a particular attribute of each item. In Listing 13-7, we have a list of <code>Rectangle</code> instances and we use <code>sort_by_key</code> to order them by their <code>width</code> attribute from low to high:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">#[derive(Debug)]

To count the number of times the closure is called, keeping a counter in the environment and incrementing its value in the closure body is a more straightforward way to calculate that. The closure in Listing 13-9 works with <code>sort_by_key</code> because it is only capturing a mutable reference to the <code>num_sort_operations</code> counter and can therefore be called more than once:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut list = [
        Rectangle { width: 10, height: 1 },
        Rectangle { width: 3, height: 5 },
        Rectangle { width: 7, height: 12 },
    ];

    let mut num_sort_operations = 0;
    list.sort_by_key(|r| {
        num_sort_operations += 1;
        r.width
    });
    println!("{list:#?}, sorted in {num_sort_operations} operations");
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 13-9: Using an <code>FnMut</code> closure with <code>sort_by_key</code> is allowed</span></p> <p>The <code>Fn</code> traits are important when defining or using functions or types that make use of closures. In the next section, we’ll discuss iterators. Many iterator methods take closure arguments, so keep these closure details in mind as we continue!</p><div class="_attribution">
