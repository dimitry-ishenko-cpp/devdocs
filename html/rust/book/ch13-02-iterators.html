<h1 id="processing-a-series-of-items-with-iterators">Processing a Series of Items with Iterators</h1> <p>The iterator pattern allows you to perform some task on a sequence of items in turn. An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and determining when the sequence has finished. When you use iterators, you don’t have to reimplement that logic yourself.</p> <p>In Rust, iterators are <em>lazy</em>, meaning they have no effect until you call methods that consume the iterator to use it up. For example, the code in Listing 13-10 creates an iterator over the items in the vector <code>v1</code> by calling the <code>iter</code> method defined on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>. This code by itself doesn’t do anything useful.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/main.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 13-10: Creating an iterator</figcaption> </figure> <p>The iterator is stored in the <code>v1_iter</code> variable. Once we’ve created an iterator, we can use it in a variety of ways. In Listing 3-5 in Chapter 3, we iterated over an array using a <code>for</code> loop to execute some code on each of its items. Under the hood this implicitly created and then consumed an iterator, but we glossed over how exactly that works until now.</p> <p>In the example in Listing 13-11, we separate the creation of the iterator from the use of the iterator in the <code>for</code> loop. When the <code>for</code> loop is called using the iterator in <code>v1_iter</code>, each element in the iterator is used in one iteration of the loop, which prints out each value.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/main.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();

    for val in v1_iter {
        println!("Got: {val}");
    }
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 13-11: Using an iterator in a <code>for</code> loop</figcaption> </figure> <p>In languages that don’t have iterators provided by their standard libraries, you would likely write this same functionality by starting a variable at index 0, using that variable to index into the vector to get a value, and incrementing the variable value in a loop until it reached the total number of items in the vector.</p> <p>Iterators handle all that logic for you, cutting down on repetitive code you could potentially mess up. Iterators give you more flexibility to use the same logic with many different kinds of sequences, not just data structures you can index into, like vectors. Let’s examine how iterators do that.</p> <h3 id="the-iterator-trait-and-the-next-method">The <code id="">Iterator</code> Trait and the <code>next</code> Method</h3> <p>All iterators implement a trait named <code>Iterator</code> that is defined in the standard library. The definition of the trait looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;

    // methods with default implementations elided
}
}</pre> <p>Notice this definition uses some new syntax: <code>type Item</code> and <code>Self::Item</code>, which are defining an <em>associated type</em> with this trait. We’ll talk about associated types in depth in Chapter 20. For now, all you need to know is that this code says implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait requires that you also define an <code>Item</code> type, and this <code>Item</code> type is used in the return type of the <code>next</code> method. In other words, the <code>Item</code> type will be the type returned from the iterator.</p> <p>The <code>Iterator</code> trait only requires implementors to define one method: the <code>next</code> method, which returns one item of the iterator at a time wrapped in <code>Some</code> and, when iteration is over, returns <code>None</code>.</p> <p>We can call the <code>next</code> method on iterators directly; Listing 13-12 demonstrates what values are returned from repeated calls to <code>next</code> on the iterator created from the vector.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn iterator_demonstration() {
        let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

        let mut v1_iter = v1.iter();

        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&amp;1));
        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&amp;2));
        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&amp;3));
        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), None);
    }
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 13-12: Calling the <code>next</code> method on an iterator</figcaption> </figure> <p>Note that we needed to make <code>v1_iter</code> mutable: calling the <code>next</code> method on an iterator changes internal state that the iterator uses to keep track of where it is in the sequence. In other words, this code <em>consumes</em>, or uses up, the iterator. Each call to <code>next</code> eats up an item from the iterator. We didn’t need to make <code>v1_iter</code> mutable when we used a <code>for</code> loop because the loop took ownership of <code>v1_iter</code> and made it mutable behind the scenes.</p> <p>Also note that the values we get from the calls to <code>next</code> are immutable references to the values in the vector. The <code>iter</code> method produces an iterator over immutable references. If we want to create an iterator that takes ownership of <code>v1</code> and returns owned values, we can call <code>into_iter</code> instead of <code>iter</code>. Similarly, if we want to iterate over mutable references, we can call <code>iter_mut</code> instead of <code>iter</code>.</p> <h3 id="methods-that-consume-the-iterator">Methods that Consume the Iterator</h3> <p>The <code>Iterator</code> trait has a number of different methods with default implementations provided by the standard library; you can find out about these methods by looking in the standard library API documentation for the <code>Iterator</code> trait. Some of these methods call the <code>next</code> method in their definition, which is why you’re required to implement the <code>next</code> method when implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait.</p> <p>Methods that call <code>next</code> are called <em>consuming adapters</em>, because calling them uses up the iterator. One example is the <code>sum</code> method, which takes ownership of the iterator and iterates through the items by repeatedly calling <code>next</code>, thus consuming the iterator. As it iterates through, it adds each item to a running total and returns the total when iteration is complete. Listing 13-13 has a test illustrating a use of the <code>sum</code> method:</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn iterator_sum() {
        let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

        let v1_iter = v1.iter();

        let total: i32 = v1_iter.sum();

        assert_eq!(total, 6);
    }
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 13-13: Calling the <code>sum</code> method to get the total of all items in the iterator</figcaption> </figure> <p>We aren’t allowed to use <code>v1_iter</code> after the call to <code>sum</code> because <code>sum</code> takes ownership of the iterator we call it on.</p> <h3 id="methods-that-produce-other-iterators">Methods that Produce Other Iterators</h3> <p><em>Iterator adapters</em> are methods defined on the <code>Iterator</code> trait that don’t consume the iterator. Instead, they produce different iterators by changing some aspect of the original iterator.</p> <p>Listing 13-14 shows an example of calling the iterator adapter method <code>map</code>, which takes a closure to call on each item as the items are iterated through. The <code>map</code> method returns a new iterator that produces the modified items. The closure here creates a new iterator in which each item from the vector will be incremented by 1:</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/main.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let v1: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1);
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 13-14: Calling the iterator adapter <code>map</code> to create a new iterator</figcaption> </figure> <p>However, this code produces a warning:</p> <pre>$ cargo run

</pre> <p>The code in Listing 13-14 doesn’t do anything; the closure we’ve specified never gets called. The warning reminds us why: iterator adapters are lazy, and we need to consume the iterator here.</p> <p>To fix this warning and consume the iterator, we’ll use the <code>collect</code> method, which we used in Chapter 12 with <code>env::args</code> in Listing 12-1. This method consumes the iterator and collects the resulting values into a collection data type.</p> <p>In Listing 13-15, we collect the results of iterating over the iterator that’s returned from the call to <code>map</code> into a vector. This vector will end up containing each item from the original vector incremented by 1.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/main.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let v1: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = vec![1, 2, 3];

}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 13-15: Calling the <code>map</code> method to create a new iterator and then calling the <code>collect</code> method to consume the new iterator and create a vector</figcaption> </figure> <p>Because <code>map</code> takes a closure, we can specify any operation we want to perform on each item. This is a great example of how closures let you customize some behavior while reusing the iteration behavior that the <code>Iterator</code> trait provides.</p> <p>You can chain multiple calls to iterator adapters to perform complex actions in a readable way. But because all iterators are lazy, you have to call one of the consuming adapter methods to get results from calls to iterator adapters.</p> <h3 id="using-closures-that-capture-their-environment">Using Closures that Capture Their Environment</h3> <p>Many iterator adapters take closures as arguments, and commonly the closures we’ll specify as arguments to iterator adapters will be closures that capture their environment.</p> <p>For this example, we’ll use the <code>filter</code> method that takes a closure. The closure gets an item from the iterator and returns a <code>bool</code>. If the closure returns <code>true</code>, the value will be included in the iteration produced by <code>filter</code>. If the closure returns <code>false</code>, the value won’t be included.</p> <p>In Listing 13-16, we use <code>filter</code> with a closure that captures the <code>shoe_size</code> variable from its environment to iterate over a collection of <code>Shoe</code> struct instances. It will return only shoes that are the specified size.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
