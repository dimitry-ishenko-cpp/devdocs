<h1 id="refutability-whether-a-pattern-might-fail-to-match">Refutability: Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match</h1> <p>Patterns come in two forms: refutable and irrefutable. Patterns that will match for any possible value passed are <em>irrefutable</em>. An example would be <code>x</code> in the statement <code>let x = 5;</code> because <code>x</code> matches anything and therefore cannot fail to match. Patterns that can fail to match for some possible value are <em>refutable</em>. An example would be <code>Some(x)</code> in the expression <code>if let Some(x) = a_value</code> because if the value in the <code>a_value</code> variable is <code>None</code> rather than <code>Some</code>, the <code>Some(x)</code> pattern will not match.</p> <p>Function parameters, <code>let</code> statements, and <code>for</code> loops can only accept irrefutable patterns, because the program cannot do anything meaningful when values don’t match. The <code>if let</code> and <code>while let</code> expressions and the <code>let</code>-<code>else</code> statement accept refutable and irrefutable patterns, but the compiler warns against irrefutable patterns because by definition they’re intended to handle possible failure: the functionality of a conditional is in its ability to perform differently depending on success or failure.</p> <p>In general, you shouldn’t have to worry about the distinction between refutable and irrefutable patterns; however, you do need to be familiar with the concept of refutability so you can respond when you see it in an error message. In those cases, you’ll need to change either the pattern or the construct you’re using the pattern with, depending on the intended behavior of the code.</p> <p>Let’s look at an example of what happens when we try to use a refutable pattern where Rust requires an irrefutable pattern and vice versa. Listing 19-8 shows a <code>let</code> statement, but for the pattern we’ve specified <code>Some(x)</code>, a refutable pattern. As you might expect, this code will not compile.</p> <figure class="listing"> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let some_option_value: Option&lt;i32&gt; = None;
    let Some(x) = some_option_value;
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 19-8: Attempting to use a refutable pattern with <code>let</code></figcaption> </figure> <p>If <code>some_option_value</code> was a <code>None</code> value, it would fail to match the pattern <code>Some(x)</code>, meaning the pattern is refutable. However, the <code>let</code> statement can only accept an irrefutable pattern because there is nothing valid the code can do with a <code>None</code> value. At compile time, Rust will complain that we’ve tried to use a refutable pattern where an irrefutable pattern is required:</p> <pre>$ cargo run

</pre> <p>Because we didn’t cover (and couldn’t cover!) every valid value with the pattern <code>Some(x)</code>, Rust rightfully produces a compiler error.</p> <p>If we have a refutable pattern where an irrefutable pattern is needed, we can fix it by changing the code that uses the pattern: instead of using <code>let</code>, we can use <code>if let</code>. Then if the pattern doesn’t match, the code will just skip the code in the curly brackets, giving it a way to continue validly. Listing 19-9 shows how to fix the code in Listing 19-8.</p> <figure class="listing"> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let some_option_value: Option&lt;i32&gt; = None;
    if let Some(x) = some_option_value {
        println!("{x}");
    }
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 19-9: Using <code>if let</code> and a block with refutable patterns instead of <code>let</code></figcaption> </figure> <p>We’ve given the code an out! This code is perfectly valid now. However, if we give <code>if let</code> an irrefutable pattern (a pattern that will always match), such as <code>x</code>, as shown in Listing 19-10, the compiler will give a warning.</p> <figure class="listing"> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {

</pre> <p>For this reason, match arms must use refutable patterns, except for the last arm, which should match any remaining values with an irrefutable pattern. Rust allows us to use an irrefutable pattern in a <code>match</code> with only one arm, but this syntax isn’t particularly useful and could be replaced with a simpler <code>let</code> statement.</p> <p>Now that you know where to use patterns and the difference between refutable and irrefutable patterns, let’s cover all the syntax we can use to create patterns.</p><div class="_attribution">
