<h1 id="pattern-syntax">Pattern Syntax</h1> <p>In this section, we gather all the syntax valid in patterns and discuss why and when you might want to use each one.</p> <h3 id="matching-literals">Matching Literals</h3> <p>As you saw in Chapter 6, you can match patterns against literals directly. The following code gives some examples:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let x = 1;

    match x {
        1 =&gt; println!("one"),
        2 =&gt; println!("two"),
        3 =&gt; println!("three"),
        _ =&gt; println!("anything"),
    }
}</pre> <p>This code prints <code>one</code> because the value in <code>x</code> is 1. This syntax is useful when you want your code to take an action if it gets a particular concrete value.</p> <h3 id="matching-named-variables">Matching Named Variables</h3> <p>Named variables are irrefutable patterns that match any value, and we’ve used them many times in the book. However, there is a complication when you use named variables in <code>match</code> expressions. Because <code>match</code> starts a new scope, variables declared as part of a pattern inside the <code>match</code> expression will shadow those with the same name outside the <code>match</code> construct, as is the case with all variables. In Listing 18-11, we declare a variable named <code>x</code> with the value <code>Some(5)</code> and a variable <code>y</code> with the value <code>10</code>. We then create a <code>match</code> expression on the value <code>x</code>. Look at the patterns in the match arms and <code>println!</code> at the end, and try to figure out what the code will print before running this code or reading further.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);
    let y = 10;

    match x {
        Some(50) =&gt; println!("Got 50"),
        Some(y) =&gt; println!("Matched, y = {y}"),
        _ =&gt; println!("Default case, x = {:?}", x),
    }

    println!("at the end: x = {:?}, y = {y}", x);
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 18-11: A <code>match</code> expression with an arm that introduces a shadowed variable <code>y</code></span></p> <p>Let’s walk through what happens when the <code>match</code> expression runs. The pattern in the first match arm doesn’t match the defined value of <code>x</code>, so the code continues.</p> <p>The pattern in the second match arm introduces a new variable named <code>y</code> that will match any value inside a <code>Some</code> value. Because we’re in a new scope inside the <code>match</code> expression, this is a new <code>y</code> variable, not the <code>y</code> we declared at the beginning with the value 10. This new <code>y</code> binding will match any value inside a <code>Some</code>, which is what we have in <code>x</code>. Therefore, this new <code>y</code> binds to the inner value of the <code>Some</code> in <code>x</code>. That value is <code>5</code>, so the expression for that arm executes and prints <code>Matched, y = 5</code>.</p> <p>If <code>x</code> had been a <code>None</code> value instead of <code>Some(5)</code>, the patterns in the first two arms wouldn’t have matched, so the value would have matched to the underscore. We didn’t introduce the <code>x</code> variable in the pattern of the underscore arm, so the <code>x</code> in the expression is still the outer <code>x</code> that hasn’t been shadowed. In this hypothetical case, the <code>match</code> would print <code>Default case, x = None</code>.</p> <p>When the <code>match</code> expression is done, its scope ends, and so does the scope of the inner <code>y</code>. The last <code>println!</code> produces <code>at the end: x = Some(5), y = 10</code>.</p> <p>To create a <code>match</code> expression that compares the values of the outer <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, rather than introducing a shadowed variable, we would need to use a match guard conditional instead. We’ll talk about match guards later in the <a href="#extra-conditionals-with-match-guards">“Extra Conditionals with Match Guards”</a> section.</p> <h3 id="multiple-patterns">Multiple Patterns</h3> <p>In <code>match</code> expressions, you can match multiple patterns using the <code>|</code> syntax, which is the pattern <em>or</em> operator. For example, in the following code we match the value of <code>x</code> against the match arms, the first of which has an <em>or</em> option, meaning if the value of <code>x</code> matches either of the values in that arm, that arm’s code will run:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let x = 1;

    match x {
        1 | 2 =&gt; println!("one or two"),
        3 =&gt; println!("three"),
        _ =&gt; println!("anything"),
    }
}</pre> <p>This code prints <code>one or two</code>.</p> <h3 id="matching-ranges-of-values-with-">Matching Ranges of Values with <code id="">..=</code>
</h3> <p>The <code>..=</code> syntax allows us to match to an inclusive range of values. In the following code, when a pattern matches any of the values within the given range, that arm will execute:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    match x {
        1..=5 =&gt; println!("one through five"),
        _ =&gt; println!("something else"),
    }
}</pre> <p>If <code>x</code> is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the first arm will match. This syntax is more convenient for multiple match values than using the <code>|</code> operator to express the same idea; if we were to use <code>|</code> we would have to specify <code>1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5</code>. Specifying a range is much shorter, especially if we want to match, say, any number between 1 and 1,000!</p> <p>The compiler checks that the range isn’t empty at compile time, and because the only types for which Rust can tell if a range is empty or not are <code>char</code> and numeric values, ranges are only allowed with numeric or <code>char</code> values.</p> <p>Here is an example using ranges of <code>char</code> values:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let x = 'c';

    match x {
        'a'..='j' =&gt; println!("early ASCII letter"),
        'k'..='z' =&gt; println!("late ASCII letter"),
        _ =&gt; println!("something else"),
    }
}</pre> <p>Rust can tell that <code>'c'</code> is within the first pattern’s range and prints <code>early ASCII letter</code>.</p> <h3 id="destructuring-to-break-apart-values">Destructuring to Break Apart Values</h3> <p>We can also use patterns to destructure structs, enums, and tuples to use different parts of these values. Let’s walk through each value.</p> <h4 id="destructuring-structs">Destructuring Structs</h4> <p>Listing 18-12 shows a <code>Point</code> struct with two fields, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, that we can break apart using a pattern with a <code>let</code> statement.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">struct Point {

    assert_eq!(7, b);
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 18-12: Destructuring a struct’s fields into separate variables</span></p> <p>This code creates the variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> that match the values of the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> fields of the <code>p</code> struct. This example shows that the names of the variables in the pattern don’t have to match the field names of the struct. However, it’s common to match the variable names to the field names to make it easier to remember which variables came from which fields. Because of this common usage, and because writing <code>let Point { x: x, y: y } = p;</code> contains a lot of duplication, Rust has a shorthand for patterns that match struct fields: you only need to list the name of the struct field, and the variables created from the pattern will have the same names. Listing 18-13 behaves in the same way as the code in Listing 18-12, but the variables created in the <code>let</code> pattern are <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> instead of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">struct Point {

The outcome is that the variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> contain the values from the <code>p</code> struct.</p> <p>We can also destructure with literal values as part of the struct pattern rather than creating variables for all the fields. Doing so allows us to test some of the fields for particular values while creating variables to destructure the other fields.</p> <p>In Listing 18-14, we have a <code>match</code> expression that separates <code>Point</code> values into three cases: points that lie directly on the <code>x</code> axis (which is true when <code>y = 0</code>), on the <code>y</code> axis (<code>x = 0</code>), or neither.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">struct Point {

The third arm doesn’t specify any literals, so it matches any other <code>Point</code> and creates variables for both the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> fields.</p> <p>In this example, the value <code>p</code> matches the second arm by virtue of <code>x</code> containing a 0, so this code will print <code>On the y axis at 7</code>.</p> <p>Remember that a <code>match</code> expression stops checking arms once it has found the first matching pattern, so even though <code>Point { x: 0, y: 0}</code> is on the <code>x</code> axis and the <code>y</code> axis, this code would only print <code>On the x axis at 0</code>.</p> <h4 id="destructuring-enums">Destructuring Enums</h4> <p>We've destructured enums in this book (for example, Listing 6-5 in Chapter 6), but haven’t yet explicitly discussed that the pattern to destructure an enum corresponds to the way the data stored within the enum is defined. As an example, in Listing 18-15 we use the <code>Message</code> enum from Listing 6-2 and write a <code>match</code> with patterns that will destructure each inner value.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">enum Message {

We can only match on the literal <code>Message::Quit</code> value, and no variables are in that pattern.</p> <p>For struct-like enum variants, such as <code>Message::Move</code>, we can use a pattern similar to the pattern we specify to match structs. After the variant name, we place curly brackets and then list the fields with variables so we break apart the pieces to use in the code for this arm. Here we use the shorthand form as we did in Listing 18-13.</p> <p>For tuple-like enum variants, like <code>Message::Write</code> that holds a tuple with one element and <code>Message::ChangeColor</code> that holds a tuple with three elements, the pattern is similar to the pattern we specify to match tuples. The number of variables in the pattern must match the number of elements in the variant we’re matching.</p> <h4 id="destructuring-nested-structs-and-enums">Destructuring Nested Structs and Enums</h4> <p>So far, our examples have all been matching structs or enums one level deep, but matching can work on nested items too! For example, we can refactor the code in Listing 18-15 to support RGB and HSV colors in the <code>ChangeColor</code> message, as shown in Listing 18-16.</p> <pre data-language="rust">enum Color {
    Rgb(i32, i32, i32),

}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 18-16: Matching on nested enums</span></p> <p>The pattern of the first arm in the <code>match</code> expression matches a <code>Message::ChangeColor</code> enum variant that contains a <code>Color::Rgb</code> variant; then the pattern binds to the three inner <code>i32</code> values. The pattern of the second arm also matches a <code>Message::ChangeColor</code> enum variant, but the inner enum matches <code>Color::Hsv</code> instead. We can specify these complex conditions in one <code>match</code> expression, even though two enums are involved.</p> <h4 id="destructuring-structs-and-tuples">Destructuring Structs and Tuples</h4> <p>We can mix, match, and nest destructuring patterns in even more complex ways. The following example shows a complicated destructure where we nest structs and tuples inside a tuple and destructure all the primitive values out:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    struct Point {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,

    let ((feet, inches), Point { x, y }) = ((3, 10), Point { x: 3, y: -10 });
}</pre> <p>This code lets us break complex types into their component parts so we can use the values we’re interested in separately.</p> <p>Destructuring with patterns is a convenient way to use pieces of values, such as the value from each field in a struct, separately from each other.</p> <h3 id="ignoring-values-in-a-pattern">Ignoring Values in a Pattern</h3> <p>You’ve seen that it’s sometimes useful to ignore values in a pattern, such as in the last arm of a <code>match</code>, to get a catchall that doesn’t actually do anything but does account for all remaining possible values. There are a few ways to ignore entire values or parts of values in a pattern: using the <code>_</code> pattern (which you’ve seen), using the <code>_</code> pattern within another pattern, using a name that starts with an underscore, or using <code>..</code> to ignore remaining parts of a value. Let’s explore how and why to use each of these patterns.</p> <h4 id="ignoring-an-entire-value-with-_">Ignoring an Entire Value with <code id="">_</code>
</h4> <p>We’ve used the underscore as a wildcard pattern that will match any value but not bind to the value. This is especially useful as the last arm in a <code>match</code> expression, but we can also use it in any pattern, including function parameters, as shown in Listing 18-17.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">fn foo(_: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("This code only uses the y parameter: {}", y);
}

fn main() {
    foo(3, 4);
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 18-17: Using <code>_</code> in a function signature</span></p> <p>This code will completely ignore the value <code>3</code> passed as the first argument, and will print <code>This code only uses the y parameter: 4</code>.</p> <p>In most cases when you no longer need a particular function parameter, you would change the signature so it doesn’t include the unused parameter. Ignoring a function parameter can be especially useful in cases when, for example, you're implementing a trait when you need a certain type signature but the function body in your implementation doesn’t need one of the parameters. You then avoid getting a compiler warning about unused function parameters, as you would if you used a name instead.</p> <h4 id="ignoring-parts-of-a-value-with-a-nested-_">Ignoring Parts of a Value with a Nested <code id="">_</code>
</h4> <p>We can also use <code>_</code> inside another pattern to ignore just part of a value, for example, when we want to test for only part of a value but have no use for the other parts in the corresponding code we want to run. Listing 18-18 shows code responsible for managing a setting’s value. The business requirements are that the user should not be allowed to overwrite an existing customization of a setting but can unset the setting and give it a value if it is currently unset.</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let mut setting_value = Some(5);
    let new_setting_value = Some(10);

    match (setting_value, new_setting_value) {
        (Some(_), Some(_)) =&gt; {
            println!("Can't overwrite an existing customized value");
        }
        _ =&gt; {
            setting_value = new_setting_value;
        }
    }

    println!("setting is {:?}", setting_value);

In the first match arm, we don’t need to match on or use the values inside either <code>Some</code> variant, but we do need to test for the case when <code>setting_value</code> and <code>new_setting_value</code> are the <code>Some</code> variant. In that case, we print the reason for not changing <code>setting_value</code>, and it doesn’t get changed.</p> <p>In all other cases (if either <code>setting_value</code> or <code>new_setting_value</code> are <code>None</code>) expressed by the <code>_</code> pattern in the second arm, we want to allow <code>new_setting_value</code> to become <code>setting_value</code>.</p> <p>We can also use underscores in multiple places within one pattern to ignore particular values.

</h4> <p>If you create a variable but don’t use it anywhere, Rust will usually issue a warning because an unused variable could be a bug. However, sometimes it’s useful to be able to create a variable you won’t use yet, such as when you’re prototyping or just starting a project. In this situation, you can tell Rust not to warn you about the unused variable by starting the name of the variable with an underscore. In Listing 18-20, we create two unused variables, but when we compile this code, we should only get a warning about one of them.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {

The <code>..</code> pattern ignores any parts of a value that we haven’t explicitly matched in the rest of the pattern. In Listing 18-23, we have a <code>Point</code> struct that holds a coordinate in three-dimensional space.

The variable name <code>second</code> doesn’t mean anything special to Rust, so we get a compiler error because using <code>..</code> in two places like this is ambiguous.</p> <h3 id="extra-conditionals-with-match-guards">Extra Conditionals with Match Guards</h3> <p>A <em>match guard</em> is an additional <code>if</code> condition, specified after the pattern in a <code>match</code> arm, that must also match for that arm to be chosen. Match guards are useful for expressing more complex ideas than a pattern alone allows.</p> <p>The condition can use variables created in the pattern. Listing 18-26 shows a <code>match</code> where the first arm has the pattern <code>Some(x)</code> and also has a match guard of <code>if x % 2 == 0</code> (which will be true if the number is even).</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let num = Some(4);

    match num {
        Some(x) if x % 2 == 0 =&gt; println!("The number {} is even", x),
        Some(x) =&gt; println!("The number {} is odd", x),
        None =&gt; (),
    }
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 18-26: Adding a match guard to a pattern</span></p> <p>This example will print <code>The number 4 is even</code>. When <code>num</code> is compared to the pattern in the first arm, it matches, because <code>Some(4)</code> matches <code>Some(x)</code>. Then the match guard checks whether the remainder of dividing <code>x</code> by 2 is equal to 0, and because it is, the first arm is selected.</p> <p>If <code>num</code> had been <code>Some(5)</code> instead, the match guard in the first arm would have been false because the remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1, which is not equal to 0. Rust would then go to the second arm, which would match because the second arm doesn’t have a match guard and therefore matches any <code>Some</code> variant.</p> <p>There is no way to express the <code>if x % 2 == 0</code> condition within a pattern, so the match guard gives us the ability to express this logic. The downside of this additional expressiveness is that the compiler doesn't try to check for exhaustiveness when match guard expressions are involved.</p> <p>In Listing 18-11, we mentioned that we could use match guards to solve our pattern-shadowing problem. Recall that we created a new variable inside the pattern in the <code>match</code> expression instead of using the variable outside the <code>match</code>. That new variable meant we couldn’t test against the value of the outer variable. Listing 18-27 shows how we can use a match guard to fix this problem.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);
    let y = 10;

    match x {
        Some(50) =&gt; println!("Got 50"),
        Some(n) if n == y =&gt; println!("Matched, n = {n}"),
        _ =&gt; println!("Default case, x = {:?}", x),
    }

    println!("at the end: x = {:?}, y = {y}", x);
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 18-27: Using a match guard to test for equality with an outer variable</span></p> <p>This code will now print <code>Default case, x = Some(5)</code>. The pattern in the second match arm doesn’t introduce a new variable <code>y</code> that would shadow the outer <code>y</code>, meaning we can use the outer <code>y</code> in the match guard. Instead of specifying the pattern as <code>Some(y)</code>, which would have shadowed the outer <code>y</code>, we specify <code>Some(n)</code>. This creates a new variable <code>n</code> that doesn’t shadow anything because there is no <code>n</code> variable outside the <code>match</code>.</p> <p>The match guard <code>if n == y</code> is not a pattern and therefore doesn’t introduce new variables. This <code>y</code> <em>is</em> the outer <code>y</code> rather than a new shadowed <code>y</code>, and we can look for a value that has the same value as the outer <code>y</code> by comparing <code>n</code> to <code>y</code>.</p> <p>You can also use the <em>or</em> operator <code>|</code> in a match guard to specify multiple patterns; the match guard condition will apply to all the patterns. Listing 18-28 shows the precedence when combining a pattern that uses <code>|</code> with a match guard. The important part of this example is that the <code>if y</code> match guard applies to <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, <em>and</em> <code>6</code>, even though it might look like <code>if y</code> only applies to <code>6</code>.</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let x = 4;
    let y = false;

    match x {
        4 | 5 | 6 if y =&gt; println!("yes"),
        _ =&gt; println!("no"),
    }
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 18-28: Combining multiple patterns with a match guard</span></p> <p>The match condition states that the arm only matches if the value of <code>x</code> is equal to <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, or <code>6</code> <em>and</em> if <code>y</code> is <code>true</code>. When this code runs, the pattern of the first arm matches because <code>x</code> is <code>4</code>, but the match guard <code>if y</code> is false, so the first arm is not chosen. The code moves on to the second arm, which does match, and this program prints <code>no</code>. The reason is that the <code>if</code> condition applies to the whole pattern <code>4 | 5 | 6</code>, not only to the last value <code>6</code>. In other words, the precedence of a match guard in relation to a pattern behaves like this:</p> <pre>(4 | 5 | 6) if y =&gt; ...
</pre> <p>rather than this:</p> <pre>4 | 5 | (6 if y) =&gt; ...
</pre> <p>After running the code, the precedence behavior is evident: if the match guard were applied only to the final value in the list of values specified using the <code>|</code> operator, the arm would have matched and the program would have printed <code>yes</code>.</p> <h3 id="-bindings">
<code id="">@</code> Bindings</h3> <p>The <em>at</em> operator <code>@</code> lets us create a variable that holds a value at the same time as we’re testing that value for a pattern match. In Listing 18-29, we want to test that a <code>Message::Hello</code> <code>id</code> field is within the range <code>3..=7</code>. We also want to bind the value to the variable <code>id_variable</code> so we can use it in the code associated with the arm. We could name this variable <code>id</code>, the same as the field, but for this example we’ll use a different name.</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    enum Message {
        Hello { id: i32 },
    }

    let msg = Message::Hello { id: 5 };

    match msg {
        Message::Hello {
            id: id_variable @ 3..=7,
        } =&gt; println!("Found an id in range: {}", id_variable),
        Message::Hello { id: 10..=12 } =&gt; {
            println!("Found an id in another range")
        }
        Message::Hello { id } =&gt; println!("Found some other id: {}", id),
    }
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 18-29: Using <code>@</code> to bind to a value in a pattern while also testing it</span></p> <p>This example will print <code>Found an id in range: 5</code>. By specifying <code>id_variable @</code> before the range <code>3..=7</code>, we’re capturing whatever value matched the range while also testing that the value matched the range pattern.</p> <p>In the second arm, where we only have a range specified in the pattern, the code associated with the arm doesn’t have a variable that contains the actual value of the <code>id</code> field. The <code>id</code> field’s value could have been 10, 11, or 12, but the code that goes with that pattern doesn’t know which it is. The pattern code isn’t able to use the value from the <code>id</code> field, because we haven’t saved the <code>id</code> value in a variable.</p> <p>In the last arm, where we’ve specified a variable without a range, we do have the value available to use in the arm’s code in a variable named <code>id</code>. The reason is that we’ve used the struct field shorthand syntax. But we haven’t applied any test to the value in the <code>id</code> field in this arm, as we did with the first two arms: any value would match this pattern.</p> <p>Using <code>@</code> lets us test a value and save it in a variable within one pattern.</p> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>Rust’s patterns are very useful in distinguishing between different kinds of data. When used in <code>match</code> expressions, Rust ensures your patterns cover every possible value, or your program won’t compile. Patterns in <code>let</code> statements and function parameters make those constructs more useful, enabling the destructuring of values into smaller parts at the same time as assigning to variables. We can create simple or complex patterns to suit our needs.</p> <p>Next, for the penultimate chapter of the book, we’ll look at some advanced aspects of a variety of Rust’s features.</p><div class="_attribution">
