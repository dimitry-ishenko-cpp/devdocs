<h1 id="comments">Comments</h1> <p>All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand, but sometimes extra explanation is warranted. In these cases, programmers leave <em>comments</em> in their source code that the compiler will ignore but people reading the source code may find useful.</p> <p>Here’s a simple comment:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
// hello, world
}</pre> <p>In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes, and the comment continues until the end of the line. For comments that extend beyond a single line, you’ll need to include <code>//</code> on each line, like this:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
// So we’re doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what’s going on.
}</pre> <p>Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7; // I’m feeling lucky today
}</pre> <p>But you’ll more often see them used in this format, with the comment on a separate line above the code it’s annotating:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    // I’m feeling lucky today
    let lucky_number = 7;
}</pre> <p>Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments, which we’ll discuss in the <a href="ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html">“Publishing a Crate to Crates.io”</a> section of Chapter 14.</p><div class="_attribution">
