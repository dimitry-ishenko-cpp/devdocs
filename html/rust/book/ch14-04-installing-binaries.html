</h2> <p>The <code>cargo install</code> command allows you to install and use binary crates locally. This isn’t intended to replace system packages; it’s meant to be a convenient way for Rust developers to install tools that others have shared on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>. Note that you can only install packages that have binary targets. A <em>binary target</em> is the runnable program that is created if the crate has a <em>src/main.rs</em> file or another file specified as a binary, as opposed to a library target that isn’t runnable on its own but is suitable for including within other programs. Usually, crates have information in the <em>README</em> file about whether a crate is a library, has a binary target, or both.</p> <p>All binaries installed with <code>cargo install</code> are stored in the installation root’s <em>bin</em> folder. If you installed Rust using <em>rustup.rs</em> and don’t have any custom configurations, this directory will be <em>$HOME/.cargo/bin</em>. Ensure that directory is in your <code>$PATH</code>to be able to run programs you’ve installed with<code>cargo install</code>.</p> <p>For example, in Chapter 12 we mentioned that there’s a Rust implementation of the <code>grep</code> tool called <code>ripgrep</code> for searching files. To install <code>ripgrep</code>, we can run the following:</p>  <pre>$ cargo install ripgrep

  Installing ~/.cargo/bin/rg
   Installed package `ripgrep v13.0.0` (executable `rg`)
</pre> <p>The second-to-last line of the output shows the location and the name of the installed binary, which in the case of <code>ripgrep</code> is <code>rg</code>. As long as the installation directory is in your <code>$PATH</code>, as mentioned previously, you can then run <code>rg --help</code> and start using a faster, rustier tool for searching files!</p><div class="_attribution">
