<h1 id="paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree">Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree</h1> <p>To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same way we use a path when navigating a filesystem. To call a function, we need to know its path.</p> <p>A path can take two forms:</p> <ul> <li>An <em>absolute path</em> is the full path starting from a crate root; for code from an external crate, the absolute path begins with the crate name, and for code from the current crate, it starts with the literal <code>crate</code>.</li> <li>A <em>relative path</em> starts from the current module and uses <code>self</code>, <code>super</code>, or an identifier in the current module.</li> </ul> <p>Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers separated by double colons (<code>::</code>).</p> <p>Returning to Listing 7-1, say we want to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function. This is the same as asking: what’s the path of the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function? Listing 7-3 contains Listing 7-1 with some of the modules and functions removed.</p> <p>We’ll show two ways to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function from a new function, <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, defined in the crate root. These paths are correct, but there’s another problem remaining that will prevent this example from compiling as is. We’ll explain why in a bit.</p> <p>The <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function is part of our library crate’s public API, so we mark it with the <code>pub</code> keyword. In the <a href="ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html#exposing-paths-with-the-pub-keyword">“Exposing Paths with the <code>pub</code> Keyword”</a> section, we’ll go into more detail about <code>pub</code>.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 7-3: Calling the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function using absolute and relative paths</figcaption> </figure> <p>The first time we call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, we use an absolute path. The <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is defined in the same crate as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, which means we can use the <code>crate</code> keyword to start an absolute path. We then include each of the successive modules until we make our way to <code>add_to_waitlist</code>. You can imagine a filesystem with the same structure: we’d specify the path <code>/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist</code> to run the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> program; using the <code>crate</code> name to start from the crate root is like using <code>/</code> to start from the filesystem root in your shell.</p> <p>The second time we call <code>add_to_waitlist</code> in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, we use a relative path. The path starts with <code>front_of_house</code>, the name of the module defined at the same level of the module tree as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>. Here the filesystem equivalent would be using the path <code>front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist</code>. Starting with a module name means that the path is relative.</p> <p>Choosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you’ll make based on your project, and it depends on whether you’re more likely to move item definition code separately from or together with the code that uses the item. For example, if we moved the <code>front_of_house</code> module and the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function into a module named <code>customer_experience</code>, we’d need to update the absolute path to <code>add_to_waitlist</code>, but the relative path would still be valid. However, if we moved the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function separately into a module named <code>dining</code>, the absolute path to the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> call would stay the same, but the relative path would need to be updated. Our preference in general is to specify absolute paths because it’s more likely we’ll want to move code definitions and item calls independently of each other.</p> <p>Let’s try to compile Listing 7-3 and find out why it won’t compile yet! The errors we get are shown in Listing 7-4.</p> <figure class="listing"> <pre>$ cargo build

error: could not compile `restaurant` (lib) due to 2 previous errors
</pre> <figcaption>Listing 7-4: Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-3</figcaption> </figure> <p>The error messages say that module <code>hosting</code> is private. In other words, we have the correct paths for the <code>hosting</code> module and the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function, but Rust won’t let us use them because it doesn’t have access to the private sections. In Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private to parent modules by default. If you want to make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module.</p> <p>Items in a parent module can’t use the private items inside child modules, but items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. This is because child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, but the child modules can see the context in which they’re defined. To continue with our metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant they operate.</p> <p>Rust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding inner implementation details is the default. That way, you know which parts of the inner code you can change without breaking outer code. However, Rust does give you the option to expose inner parts of child modules’ code to outer ancestor modules by using the <code>pub</code> keyword to make an item public.</p> <h3 id="exposing-paths-with-the-pub-keyword">Exposing Paths with the <code id="">pub</code> Keyword</h3> <p>Let’s return to the error in Listing 7-4 that told us the <code>hosting</code> module is private. We want the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function in the parent module to have access to the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in the child module, so we mark the <code>hosting</code> module with the <code>pub</code> keyword, as shown in Listing 7-5.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">mod front_of_house {

error: could not compile `restaurant` (lib) due to 2 previous errors
</pre> <figcaption>Listing 7-6: Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-5</figcaption> </figure> <p>What happened? Adding the <code>pub</code> keyword in front of <code>mod hosting</code> makes the module public. With this change, if we can access <code>front_of_house</code>, we can access <code>hosting</code>. But the <em>contents</em> of <code>hosting</code> are still private; making the module public doesn’t make its contents public. The <code>pub</code> keyword on a module only lets code in its ancestor modules refer to it, not access its inner code. Because modules are containers, there’s not much we can do by only making the module public; we need to go further and choose to make one or more of the items within the module public as well.</p> <p>The errors in Listing 7-6 say that the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is private. The privacy rules apply to structs, enums, functions, and methods as well as modules.</p> <p>Let’s also make the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function public by adding the <code>pub</code> keyword before its definition, as in Listing 7-7.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 7-7: Adding the <code>pub</code> keyword to <code>mod hosting</code> and <code>fn add_to_waitlist</code> lets us call the function from <code>eat_at_restaurant</code></figcaption> </figure> <p>Now the code will compile! To see why adding the <code>pub</code> keyword lets us use these paths in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> with respect to the privacy rules, let’s look at the absolute and the relative paths.</p> <p>In the absolute path, we start with <code>crate</code>, the root of our crate’s module tree. The <code>front_of_house</code> module is defined in the crate root. While <code>front_of_house</code> isn’t public, because the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function is defined in the same module as <code>front_of_house</code> (that is, <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> and <code>front_of_house</code> are siblings), we can refer to <code>front_of_house</code> from <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>. Next is the <code>hosting</code> module marked with <code>pub</code>. We can access the parent module of <code>hosting</code>, so we can access <code>hosting</code>. Finally, the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is marked with <code>pub</code> and we can access its parent module, so this function call works!</p> <p>In the relative path, the logic is the same as the absolute path except for the first step: rather than starting from the crate root, the path starts from <code>front_of_house</code>. The <code>front_of_house</code> module is defined within the same module as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, so the relative path starting from the module in which <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> is defined works. Then, because <code>hosting</code> and <code>add_to_waitlist</code> are marked with <code>pub</code>, the rest of the path works, and this function call is valid!</p> <p>If you plan on sharing your library crate so other projects can use your code, your public API is your contract with users of your crate that determines how they can interact with your code. There are many considerations around managing changes to your public API to make it easier for people to depend on your crate. These considerations are out of the scope of this book; if you’re interested in this topic, see <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/">The Rust API Guidelines</a>.</p> <section class="note" aria-role="note"> <h4 id="best-practices-for-packages-with-a-binary-and-a-library">Best Practices for Packages with a Binary and a Library</h4> <p>We mentioned that a package can contain both a <em>src/main.rs</em> binary crate root as well as a <em>src/lib.rs</em> library crate root, and both crates will have the package name by default. Typically, packages with this pattern of containing both a library and a binary crate will have just enough code in the binary crate to start an executable that calls code within the library crate. This lets other projects benefit from most of the functionality that the package provides because the library crate’s code can be shared.</p> <p>The module tree should be defined in <em>src/lib.rs</em>. Then, any public items can be used in the binary crate by starting paths with the name of the package. The binary crate becomes a user of the library crate just like a completely external crate would use the library crate: it can only use the public API. This helps you design a good API; not only are you the author, you’re also a client!</p> <p>In <a href="ch12-00-an-io-project.html">Chapter 12</a>, we’ll demonstrate this organizational practice with a command-line program that will contain both a binary crate and a library crate.</p> </section> <h3 id="starting-relative-paths-with-super">Starting Relative Paths with <code id="">super</code>
</h3> <p>We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than the current module or the crate root, by using <code>super</code> at the start of the path. This is like starting a filesystem path with the <code>..</code> syntax. Using <code>super</code> allows us to reference an item that we know is in the parent module, which can make rearranging the module tree easier when the module is closely related to the parent but the parent might be moved elsewhere in the module tree someday.</p> <p>Consider the code in Listing 7-8 that models the situation in which a chef fixes an incorrect order and personally brings it out to the customer. The function <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> defined in the <code>back_of_house</code> module calls the function <code>deliver_order</code> defined in the parent module by specifying the path to <code>deliver_order</code>, starting with <code>super</code>.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">fn deliver_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
    fn fix_incorrect_order() {
        cook_order();
        super::deliver_order();
    }

    fn cook_order() {}
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 7-8: Calling a function using a relative path starting with <code>super</code></figcaption> </figure> <p>The <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> function is in the <code>back_of_house</code> module, so we can use <code>super</code> to go to the parent module of <code>back_of_house</code>, which in this case is <code>crate</code>, the root. From there, we look for <code>deliver_order</code> and find it. Success! We think the <code>back_of_house</code> module and the <code>deliver_order</code> function are likely to stay in the same relationship to each other and get moved together should we decide to reorganize the crate’s module tree. Therefore, we used <code>super</code> so we’ll have fewer places to update code in the future if this code gets moved to a different module.</p> <h3 id="making-structs-and-enums-public">Making Structs and Enums Public</h3> <p>We can also use <code>pub</code> to designate structs and enums as public, but there are a few extra details to the usage of <code>pub</code> with structs and enums. If we use <code>pub</code> before a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the struct’s fields will still be private. We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case basis. In Listing 7-9, we’ve defined a public <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> struct with a public <code>toast</code> field but a private <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field. This models the case in a restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that comes with a meal, but the chef decides which fruit accompanies the meal based on what’s in season and in stock. The available fruit changes quickly, so customers can’t choose the fruit or even see which fruit they’ll get.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">mod back_of_house {
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub toast: String,
        seasonal_fruit: String,
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer(toast: &amp;str) -&gt; Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                toast: String::from(toast),
                seasonal_fruit: String::from("peaches"),
            }
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast
    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer("Rye");
    // Change our mind about what bread we'd like
    meal.toast = String::from("Wheat");
    println!("I'd like {} toast please", meal.toast);

    // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed
    // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal
    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from("blueberries");
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 7-9: A struct with some public fields and some private fields</figcaption> </figure> <p>Because the <code>toast</code> field in the <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> struct is public, in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> we can write and read to the <code>toast</code> field using dot notation. Notice that we can’t use the <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, because <code>seasonal_fruit</code> is private. Try uncommenting the line modifying the <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field value to see what error you get!</p> <p>Also, note that because <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> has a private field, the struct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs an instance of <code>Breakfast</code> (we’ve named it <code>summer</code> here). If <code>Breakfast</code> didn’t have such a function, we couldn’t create an instance of <code>Breakfast</code> in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> because we couldn’t set the value of the private <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p> <p>In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public. We only need the <code>pub</code> before the <code>enum</code> keyword, as shown in Listing 7-10.</p> <figure class="listing"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">mod back_of_house {
    pub enum Appetizer {
        Soup,
        Salad,
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}</pre> <figcaption>Listing 7-10: Designating an enum as public makes all its variants public</figcaption> </figure> <p>Because we made the <code>Appetizer</code> enum public, we can use the <code>Soup</code> and <code>Salad</code> variants in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p> <p>Enums aren’t very useful unless their variants are public; it would be annoying to have to annotate all enum variants with <code>pub</code> in every case, so the default for enum variants is to be public. Structs are often useful without their fields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of everything being private by default unless annotated with <code>pub</code>.</p> <p>There’s one more situation involving <code>pub</code> that we haven’t covered, and that is our last module system feature: the <code>use</code> keyword. We’ll cover <code>use</code> by itself first, and then we’ll show how to combine <code>pub</code> and <code>use</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
