<h1 id="using-structs-to-structure-related-data">Using Structs to Structure Related Data</h1> <p>A <em>struct</em>, or <em>structure</em>, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a <em>struct</em> is like an object’s data attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples with structs to build on what you already know and demonstrate when structs are a better way to group data.</p> <p>We’ll demonstrate how to define and instantiate structs. We’ll discuss how to define associated functions, especially the kind of associated functions called <em>methods</em>, to specify behavior associated with a struct type. Structs and enums (discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile-time type checking.</p><div class="_attribution">
