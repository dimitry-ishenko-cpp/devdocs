<h1 id="concise-control-flow-with-if-let">Concise Control Flow with <code id="">if let</code>
</h1> <p>The <code>if let</code> syntax lets you combine <code>if</code> and <code>let</code> into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider the program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an <code>Option&lt;u8&gt;</code> value in the <code>config_max</code> variable but only wants to execute code if the value is the <code>Some</code> variant.</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    match config_max {
        Some(max) =&gt; println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max),
        _ =&gt; (),
    }
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 6-6: A <code>match</code> that only cares about executing code when the value is <code>Some</code></span></p> <p>If the value is <code>Some</code>, we print out the value in the <code>Some</code> variant by binding the value to the variable <code>max</code> in the pattern. We don’t want to do anything with the <code>None</code> value. To satisfy the <code>match</code> expression, we have to add <code>_ =&gt; ()</code> after processing just one variant, which is annoying boilerplate code to add.</p> <p>Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using <code>if let</code>. The following code behaves the same as the <code>match</code> in Listing 6-6:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    if let Some(max) = config_max {
        println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max);
    }
}</pre> <p>The syntax <code>if let</code> takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign. It works the same way as a <code>match</code>, where the expression is given to the <code>match</code> and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is <code>Some(max)</code>, and the <code>max</code> binds to the value inside the <code>Some</code>. We can then use <code>max</code> in the body of the <code>if let</code> block in the same way we used <code>max</code> in the corresponding <code>match</code> arm. The code in the <code>if let</code> block isn’t run if the value doesn’t match the pattern.</p> <p>Using <code>if let</code> means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code. However, you lose the exhaustive checking that <code>match</code> enforces. Choosing between <code>match</code> and <code>if let</code> depends on what you’re doing in your particular situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.</p> <p>In other words, you can think of <code>if let</code> as syntax sugar for a <code>match</code> that runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.</p> <p>We can include an <code>else</code> with an <code>if let</code>. The block of code that goes with the <code>else</code> is the same as the block of code that would go with the <code>_</code> case in the <code>match</code> expression that is equivalent to the <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code>. Recall the <code>Coin</code> enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the <code>Quarter</code> variant also held a <code>UsState</code> value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see while also announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a <code>match</code> expression, like this:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#[derive(Debug)]
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}

fn main() {
    let coin = Coin::Penny;
    let mut count = 0;
    match coin {
        Coin::Quarter(state) =&gt; println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state),
        _ =&gt; count += 1,
    }
}</pre> <p>Or we could use an <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code> expression, like this:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#[derive(Debug)]
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}

fn main() {
    let coin = Coin::Penny;
    let mut count = 0;
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
    } else {
        count += 1;
    }
}</pre> <p>If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to express using a <code>match</code>, remember that <code>if let</code> is in your Rust toolbox as well.</p> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>We’ve now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be one of a set of enumerated values. We’ve shown how the standard library’s <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> type helps you use the type system to prevent errors. When enum values have data inside them, you can use <code>match</code> or <code>if let</code> to extract and use those values, depending on how many cases you need to handle.</p> <p>Your Rust programs can now express concepts in your domain using structs and enums. Creating custom types to use in your API ensures type safety: the compiler will make certain your functions only get values of the type each function expects.</p> <p>In order to provide a well-organized API to your users that is straightforward to use and only exposes exactly what your users will need, let’s now turn to Rust’s modules.</p><div class="_attribution">
