<h1 id="cargo-workspaces">Cargo Workspaces</h1> <p>In Chapter 12, we built a package that included a binary crate and a library crate. As your project develops, you might find that the library crate continues to get bigger and you want to split your package further into multiple library crates. Cargo offers a feature called <em>workspaces</em> that can help manage multiple related packages that are developed in tandem.</p> <h3 id="creating-a-workspace">Creating a Workspace</h3> <p>A <em>workspace</em> is a set of packages that share the same <em>Cargo.lock</em> and output directory. Let’s make a project using a workspace—we’ll use trivial code so we can concentrate on the structure of the workspace. There are multiple ways to structure a workspace, so we'll just show one common way. We’ll have a workspace containing a binary and two libraries. The binary, which will provide the main functionality, will depend on the two libraries. One library will provide an <code>add_one</code> function, and a second library an <code>add_two</code> function. These three crates will be part of the same workspace. We’ll start by creating a new directory for the workspace:</p> <pre>$ mkdir add
$ cd add
</pre> <p>Next, in the <em>add</em> directory, we create the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file that will configure the entire workspace. This file won’t have a <code>[package]</code> section. Instead, it will start with a <code>[workspace]</code> section that will allow us to add members to the workspace by specifying the path to the package with our binary crate; in this case, that path is <em>adder</em>:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p> <pre>[workspace]

members = [
    "adder",
]
</pre> <p>Next, we’ll create the <code>adder</code> binary crate by running <code>cargo new</code> within the <em>add</em> directory:</p>  <pre>$ cargo new adder
     Created binary (application) `adder` package
</pre> <p>At this point, we can build the workspace by running <code>cargo build</code>. The files in your <em>add</em> directory should look like this:</p> <pre>├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target
</pre> <p>The workspace has one <em>target</em> directory at the top level that the compiled artifacts will be placed into; the <code>adder</code> package doesn’t have its own <em>target</em> directory. Even if we were to run <code>cargo build</code> from inside the <em>adder</em> directory, the compiled artifacts would still end up in <em>add/target</em> rather than <em>add/adder/target</em>. Cargo structures the <em>target</em> directory in a workspace like this because the crates in a workspace are meant to depend on each other. If each crate had its own <em>target</em> directory, each crate would have to recompile each of the other crates in the workspace to place the artifacts in its own <em>target</em> directory. By sharing one <em>target</em> directory, the crates can avoid unnecessary rebuilding.</p> <h3 id="creating-the-second-package-in-the-workspace">Creating the Second Package in the Workspace</h3> <p>Next, let’s create another member package in the workspace and call it <code>add_one</code>. Change the top-level <em>Cargo.toml</em> to specify the <em>add_one</em> path in the <code>members</code> list:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p> <pre>[workspace]

members = [
    "adder",
    "add_one",
]
</pre> <p>Then generate a new library crate named <code>add_one</code>:</p>  <pre>$ cargo new add_one --lib
     Created library `add_one` package
</pre> <p>Your <em>add</em> directory should now have these directories and files:</p> <pre>├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── add_one
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target
</pre> <p>In the <em>add_one/src/lib.rs</em> file, let’s add an <code>add_one</code> function:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: add_one/src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}</pre> <p>Now we can have the <code>adder</code> package with our binary depend on the <code>add_one</code> package that has our library. First, we’ll need to add a path dependency on <code>add_one</code> to <em>adder/Cargo.toml</em>.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: adder/Cargo.toml</span></p> <pre>[dependencies]
add_one = { path = "../add_one" }
</pre> <p>Cargo doesn’t assume that crates in a workspace will depend on each other, so we need to be explicit about the dependency relationships.</p> <p>Next, let’s use the <code>add_one</code> function (from the <code>add_one</code> crate) in the <code>adder</code> crate. Open the <em>adder/src/main.rs</em> file and add a <code>use</code> line at the top to bring the new <code>add_one</code> library crate into scope. Then change the <code>main</code> function to call the <code>add_one</code> function, as in Listing 14-7.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: adder/src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use add_one;

fn main() {
    let num = 10;
    println!("Hello, world! {num} plus one is {}!", add_one::add_one(num));
}</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 14-7: Using the <code>add_one</code> library crate from the <code>adder</code> crate</span></p> <p>Let’s build the workspace by running <code>cargo build</code> in the top-level <em>add</em> directory!</p>  <pre>$ cargo build

   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.68s
</pre> <p>To run the binary crate from the <em>add</em> directory, we can specify which package in the workspace we want to run by using the <code>-p</code> argument and the package name with <code>cargo run</code>:</p>  <pre>$ cargo run -p adder
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/adder`
Hello, world! 10 plus one is 11!
</pre> <p>This runs the code in <em>adder/src/main.rs</em>, which depends on the <code>add_one</code> crate.</p> <h4 id="depending-on-an-external-package-in-a-workspace">Depending on an External Package in a Workspace</h4> <p>Notice that the workspace has only one <em>Cargo.lock</em> file at the top level, rather than having a <em>Cargo.lock</em> in each crate’s directory. This ensures that all crates are using the same version of all dependencies. If we add the <code>rand</code> package to the <em>adder/Cargo.toml</em> and <em>add_one/Cargo.toml</em> files, Cargo will resolve both of those to one version of <code>rand</code> and record that in the one <em>Cargo.lock</em>. Making all crates in the workspace use the same dependencies means the crates will always be compatible with each other. Let’s add the <code>rand</code> crate to the <code>[dependencies]</code> section in the <em>add_one/Cargo.toml</em> file so we can use the <code>rand</code> crate in the <code>add_one</code> crate:</p>  <p><span class="filename">Filename: add_one/Cargo.toml</span></p> <pre>[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
</pre> <p>We can now add <code>use rand;</code> to the <em>add_one/src/lib.rs</em> file, and building the whole workspace by running <code>cargo build</code> in the <em>add</em> directory will bring in and compile the <code>rand</code> crate. We will get one warning because we aren’t referring to the <code>rand</code> we brought into scope:</p>  <pre>$ cargo build
    Updating crates.io index

   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 10.18s
</pre> <p>The top-level <em>Cargo.lock</em> now contains information about the dependency of <code>add_one</code> on <code>rand</code>. However, even though <code>rand</code> is used somewhere in the workspace, we can’t use it in other crates in the workspace unless we add <code>rand</code> to their <em>Cargo.toml</em> files as well. For example, if we add <code>use rand;</code> to the <em>adder/src/main.rs</em> file for the <code>adder</code> package, we’ll get an error:</p>  <pre>$ cargo build
  --snip--
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
error[E0432]: unresolved import `rand`
 --&gt; adder/src/main.rs:2:5
  |
2 | use rand;
  |     ^^^^ no external crate `rand`
</pre> <p>To fix this, edit the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file for the <code>adder</code> package and indicate that <code>rand</code> is a dependency for it as well. Building the <code>adder</code> package will add <code>rand</code> to the list of dependencies for <code>adder</code> in <em>Cargo.lock</em>, but no additional copies of <code>rand</code> will be downloaded. Cargo has ensured that every crate in every package in the workspace using the <code>rand</code> package will be using the same version, saving us space and ensuring that the crates in the workspace will be compatible with each other.</p> <h4 id="adding-a-test-to-a-workspace">Adding a Test to a Workspace</h4> <p>For another enhancement, let’s add a test of the <code>add_one::add_one</code> function within the <code>add_one</code> crate:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: add_one/src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(3, add_one(2));
    }
}</pre> <p>Now run <code>cargo test</code> in the top-level <em>add</em> directory. Running <code>cargo test</code> in a workspace structured like this one will run the tests for all the crates in the workspace:</p>  <pre>$ cargo test

</pre> <p>This output shows <code>cargo test</code> only ran the tests for the <code>add_one</code> crate and didn’t run the <code>adder</code> crate tests.</p> <p>If you publish the crates in the workspace to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, each crate in the workspace will need to be published separately. Like <code>cargo test</code>, we can publish a particular crate in our workspace by using the <code>-p</code> flag and specifying the name of the crate we want to publish.</p> <p>For additional practice, add an <code>add_two</code> crate to this workspace in a similar way as the <code>add_one</code> crate!</p> <p>As your project grows, consider using a workspace: it’s easier to understand smaller, individual components than one big blob of code. Furthermore, keeping the crates in a workspace can make coordination between crates easier if they are often changed at the same time.</p><div class="_attribution">
