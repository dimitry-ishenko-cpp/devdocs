<h1 class="main-heading">Keyword struct</h1>
<p>A type that is composed of other types.</p> <p>Structs in Rust come in three flavors: Structs with named fields, tuple structs, and unit structs.</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">struct Regular {
    field1: f32,
    field2: String,
    pub field3: bool
}

struct Tuple(u32, String);

struct Unit;</pre></div> <p>Regular structs are the most commonly used. Each field defined within them has a name and a type, and once defined can be accessed using <code>example_struct.field</code> syntax. The fields of a struct share its mutability, so <code>foo.bar = 2;</code> would only be valid if <code>foo</code> was mutable. Adding <code>pub</code> to a field makes it visible to code in other modules, as well as allowing it to be directly accessed and modified.</p> <p>Tuple structs are similar to regular structs, but its fields have no names. They are used like tuples, with deconstruction possible via <code>let TupleStruct(x, y) = foo;</code> syntax. For accessing individual variables, the same syntax is used as with regular tuples, namely <code>foo.0</code>, <code>foo.1</code>, etc, starting at zero.</p> <p>Unit structs are most commonly used as marker. They have a size of zero bytes, but unlike empty enums they can be instantiated, making them isomorphic to the unit type <code>()</code>. Unit structs are useful when you need to implement a trait on something, but don’t need to store any data inside it.</p> <h2 id="instantiation">Instantiation</h2> <p>Structs can be instantiated in different ways, all of which can be mixed and matched as needed. The most common way to make a new struct is via a constructor method such as <code>new()</code>, but when that isn’t available (or you’re writing the constructor itself), struct literal syntax is used:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">let example = Foo {
    field1: 42.0,
    field2: "blah".to_string(),
    etc: true,
};</pre></div> <p>It’s only possible to directly instantiate a struct using struct literal syntax when all of its fields are visible to you.</p> <p>There are a handful of shortcuts provided to make writing constructors more convenient, most common of which is the Field Init shorthand. When there is a variable and a field of the same name, the assignment can be simplified from <code>field: field</code> into simply <code>field</code>. The following example of a hypothetical constructor demonstrates this:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">struct User {
    name: String,
    admin: bool,
}

impl User {
    pub fn new(name: String) -&gt; Self {
        Self {
            name,
            admin: false,
        }
    }
}</pre></div> <p>Another shortcut for struct instantiation is available, used when you need to make a new struct that has the same values as most of a previous struct of the same type, called struct update syntax:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">let updated_thing = Foo {
    field1: "a new value".to_string(),
    ..thing
};</pre></div> <p>Tuple structs are instantiated in the same way as tuples themselves, except with the struct’s name as a prefix: <code>Foo(123, false, 0.1)</code>.</p> <p>Empty structs are instantiated with just their name, and don’t need anything else. <code>let thing = EmptyStruct;</code></p> <h2 id="style-conventions">Style conventions</h2> <p>Structs are always written in UpperCamelCase, with few exceptions. While the trailing comma on a struct’s list of fields can be omitted, it’s usually kept for convenience in adding and removing fields down the line.</p> <p>For more information on structs, take a look at the <a href="../book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html">Rust Book</a> or the <a href="../reference/items/structs.html">Reference</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
