<h1 class="main-heading">Keyword extern</h1>
<p>Link to or import external code.</p> <p>The <code>extern</code> keyword is used in two places in Rust. One is in conjunction with the <a href="keyword.crate.html"><code>crate</code></a> keyword to make your Rust code aware of other Rust crates in your project, i.e., <code>extern crate lazy_static;</code>. The other use is in foreign function interfaces (FFI).</p> <p><code>extern</code> is used in two different contexts within FFI. The first is in the form of external blocks, for declaring function interfaces that Rust code can call foreign code by.</p> <div class="example-wrap ignore">ⓘ<pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">#[link(name = "my_c_library")]
extern "C" {
    fn my_c_function(x: i32) -&gt; bool;
}</pre>
</div> <p>This code would attempt to link with <code>libmy_c_library.so</code> on unix-like systems and <code>my_c_library.dll</code> on Windows at runtime, and panic if it can’t find something to link to. Rust code could then use <code>my_c_function</code> as if it were any other unsafe Rust function. Working with non-Rust languages and FFI is inherently unsafe, so wrappers are usually built around C APIs.</p> <p>The mirror use case of FFI is also done via the <code>extern</code> keyword:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn callable_from_c(x: i32) -&gt; bool {
    x % 3 == 0
}</pre></div> <p>If compiled as a dylib, the resulting .so could then be linked to from a C library, and the function could be used as if it was from any other library.</p> <p>For more information on FFI, check the <a href="../book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#using-extern-functions-to-call-external-code">Rust book</a> or the <a href="../reference/items/external-blocks.html">Reference</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
