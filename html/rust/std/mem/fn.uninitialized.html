<span class="item-info"><div class="stab deprecated">
<span class="emoji">ðŸ‘Ž</span><span>Deprecated since 1.39.0: use <code>mem::MaybeUninit</code> instead</span>
</div></span><p>Bypasses Rustâ€™s normal memory-initialization checks by pretending to produce a value of type <code>T</code>, while doing nothing at all.</p> <p><strong>This function is deprecated.</strong> Use <a href="union.maybeuninit.html" title="union std::mem::MaybeUninit"><code>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;</code></a> instead. It also might be slower than using <code>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;</code> due to mitigations that were put in place to limit the potential harm caused by incorrect use of this function in legacy code.</p> <p>The reason for deprecation is that the function basically cannot be used correctly: it has the same effect as <a href="union.maybeuninit.html#method.uninit" title="associated function std::mem::MaybeUninit::uninit"><code>MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init()</code></a>. As the <a href="union.maybeuninit.html#method.assume_init" title="method std::mem::MaybeUninit::assume_init"><code>assume_init</code> documentation</a> explains, <a href="union.maybeuninit.html#initialization-invariant" title="union std::mem::MaybeUninit">the Rust compiler assumes</a> that values are properly initialized.</p> <p>Truly uninitialized memory like what gets returned here is special in that the compiler knows that it does not have a fixed value. This makes it undefined behavior to have uninitialized data in a variable even if that variable has an integer type.</p> <p>Therefore, it is immediate undefined behavior to call this function on nearly all types, including integer types and arrays of integer types, and even if the result is unused.</p><div class="_attribution">
