<p>Create a <code>const</code> raw pointer to a place, without creating an intermediate reference.</p> <p>Creating a reference with <code>&amp;</code>/<code>&amp;mut</code> is only allowed if the pointer is properly aligned and points to initialized data. For cases where those requirements do not hold, raw pointers should be used instead. However, <code>&amp;expr as *const _</code> creates a reference before casting it to a raw pointer, and that reference is subject to the same rules as all other references. This macro can create a raw pointer <em>without</em> creating a reference first.</p> <p>See <a href="macro.addr_of_mut.html" title="macro std::ptr::addr_of_mut"><code>addr_of_mut</code></a> for how to create a pointer to uninitialized data. Doing that with <code>addr_of</code> would not make much sense since one could only read the data, and that would be Undefined Behavior.</p> <h2 id="safety">Safety</h2> <p>The <code>expr</code> in <code>addr_of!(expr)</code> is evaluated as a place expression, but never loads from the place or requires the place to be dereferenceable. This means that <code>addr_of!((*ptr).field)</code> still requires the projection to <code>field</code> to be in-bounds, using the same rules as <a href="../primitive.pointer.html#method.offset" title="method pointer::offset"><code>offset</code></a>. However, <code>addr_of!(*ptr)</code> is defined behavior even if <code>ptr</code> is null, dangling, or misaligned.</p> <p>Note that <code>Deref</code>/<code>Index</code> coercions (and their mutable counterparts) are applied inside <code>addr_of!</code> like everywhere else, in which case a reference is created to call <code>Deref::deref</code> or <code>Index::index</code>, respectively. The statements above only apply when no such coercions are applied.</p> <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <p><strong>Correct usage: Creating a pointer to unaligned data</strong></p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">use std::ptr;

See the <a href="../primitive.pointer.html#method.offset" title="method pointer::offset"><code>offset</code></a> docs for a full list of requirements for inbounds pointer arithmetic; the same requirements apply to field projections, even inside <code>addr_of!</code>. (In particular, it makes no difference whether the pointer is null or dangling.)</p><div class="_attribution">
