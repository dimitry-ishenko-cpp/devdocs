<p>Converts a reference to a raw pointer.</p> <p>For <code>r: &amp;T</code>, <code>from_ref(r)</code> is equivalent to <code>r as *const T</code> (except for the caveat noted below), but is a bit safer since it will never silently change type or mutability, in particular if the code is refactored.</p> <p>The caller must ensure that the pointee outlives the pointer this function returns, or else it will end up dangling.</p> <p>The caller must also ensure that the memory the pointer (non-transitively) points to is never written to (except inside an <code>UnsafeCell</code>) using this pointer or any pointer derived from it. If you need to mutate the pointee, use <a href="fn.from_mut.html" title="fn std::ptr::from_mut"><code>from_mut</code></a>. Specifically, to turn a mutable reference <code>m: &amp;mut T</code> into <code>*const T</code>, prefer <code>from_mut(m).cast_const()</code> to obtain a pointer that can later be used for mutation.</p> <h3 id="interaction-with-lifetime-extension">Interaction with lifetime extension</h3> <p>Note that this has subtle interactions with the rules for lifetime extension of temporaries in tail expressions. This code is valid, albeit in a non-obvious way:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">// The temporary holding the return value of `foo` has its lifetime extended,
// because the surrounding expression involves no function call.
let p = &amp;foo() as *const T;
unsafe { p.read() };</pre></div> <p>Naively replacing the cast with <code>from_ref</code> is not valid:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">// The temporary holding the return value of `foo` does *not* have its lifetime extended,
// because the surrounding expression involves no function call.
let p = ptr::from_ref(&amp;foo());
unsafe { p.read() }; // UB! Reading from a dangling pointer ⚠️</pre></div> <p>The recommended way to write this code is to avoid relying on lifetime extension when raw pointers are involved:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">let x = foo();
let p = ptr::from_ref(&amp;x);
unsafe { p.read() };</pre></div><div class="_attribution">
