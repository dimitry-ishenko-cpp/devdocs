<h1 class="main-heading">Function std::ptr::write_unaligned</h1>
<pre class="rust item-decl" data-language="rust">pub unsafe fn write_unaligned&lt;T&gt;(dst: *mut T, src: T)</pre>
<p>Overwrites a memory location with the given value without reading or dropping the old value.</p> <p>Unlike <a href="fn.write.html" title="fn std::ptr::write"><code>write()</code></a>, the pointer may be unaligned.</p> <p><code>write_unaligned</code> does not drop the contents of <code>dst</code>. This is safe, but it could leak allocations or resources, so care should be taken not to overwrite an object that should be dropped.</p> <p>Additionally, it does not drop <code>src</code>. Semantically, <code>src</code> is moved into the location pointed to by <code>dst</code>.</p> <p>This is appropriate for initializing uninitialized memory, or overwriting memory that has previously been read with <a href="fn.read_unaligned.html" title="fn std::ptr::read_unaligned"><code>read_unaligned</code></a>.</p> <h2 id="safety">Safety</h2> <p>Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>dst</code> must be <a href="index.html#safety" title="mod std::ptr">valid</a> for writes.</li> </ul> <p>Note that even if <code>T</code> has size <code>0</code>, the pointer must be non-null.</p> <h3 id="on-packed-structs">On <code>packed</code> structs</h3> <p>Attempting to create a raw pointer to an <code>unaligned</code> struct field with an expression such as <code>&amp;packed.unaligned as *const FieldType</code> creates an intermediate unaligned reference before converting that to a raw pointer. That this reference is temporary and immediately cast is inconsequential as the compiler always expects references to be properly aligned. As a result, using <code>&amp;packed.unaligned as *const FieldType</code> causes immediate <em>undefined behavior</em> in your program.</p> <p>Instead you must use the <a href="macro.addr_of_mut.html" title="macro std::ptr::addr_of_mut"><code>ptr::addr_of_mut!</code></a> macro to create the pointer. You may use that returned pointer together with this function.</p> <p>An example of how to do it and how this relates to <code>write_unaligned</code> is:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">#[repr(packed, C)]
struct Packed {
    _padding: u8,
    unaligned: u32,
}

let mut packed: Packed = unsafe { std::mem::zeroed() };

// Take the address of a 32-bit integer which is not aligned.
// In contrast to `&amp;packed.unaligned as *mut _`, this has no undefined behavior.
let unaligned = std::ptr::addr_of_mut!(packed.unaligned);

unsafe { std::ptr::write_unaligned(unaligned, 42) };

assert_eq!({packed.unaligned}, 42); // `{...}` forces copying the field instead of creating a reference.</pre></div> <p>Accessing unaligned fields directly with e.g. <code>packed.unaligned</code> is safe however (as can be seen in the <code>assert_eq!</code> above).</p> <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2> <p>Write a usize value to a byte buffer:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">use std::mem;

fn write_usize(x: &amp;mut [u8], val: usize) {
    assert!(x.len() &gt;= mem::size_of::&lt;usize&gt;());

    let ptr = x.as_mut_ptr() as *mut usize;

    unsafe { ptr.write_unaligned(val) }
