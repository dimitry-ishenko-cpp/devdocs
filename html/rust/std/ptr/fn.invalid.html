<span class="emoji">üî¨</span><span>This is a nightly-only experimental API. (<code>strict_provenance</code> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">#95228</a>)</span>
</div></span><p>Creates an invalid pointer with the given address.</p> <p>This is different from <code>addr as *const T</code>, which creates a pointer that picks up a previously exposed provenance. See <a href="fn.from_exposed_addr.html" title="fn std::ptr::from_exposed_addr"><code>from_exposed_addr</code></a> for more details on that operation.</p> <p>The module‚Äôs top-level documentation discusses the precise meaning of an ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù pointer but essentially this expresses that the pointer is not associated with any actual allocation and is little more than a usize address in disguise.</p> <p>This pointer will have no provenance associated with it and is therefore UB to read/write/offset. This mostly exists to facilitate things like <code>ptr::null</code> and <code>NonNull::dangling</code> which make invalid pointers.</p> <p>(Standard ‚ÄúZero-Sized-Types get to cheat and lie‚Äù caveats apply, although it may be desirable to give them their own API just to make that 100% clear.)</p> <p>This API and its claimed semantics are part of the Strict Provenance experiment, see the <a href="index.html" title="mod std::ptr">module documentation</a> for details.</p><div class="_attribution">
