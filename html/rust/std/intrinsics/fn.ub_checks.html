<span class="emoji">ðŸ”¬</span><span>This is a nightly-only experimental API. (<code>core_intrinsics</code>)</span>
</div></span><p>Returns whether we should perform some UB-checking at runtime. This eventually evaluates to <code>cfg!(ub_checks)</code>, but behaves different from <code>cfg!</code> when mixing crates built with different flags: if the crate has UB checks enabled or carries the <code>#[rustc_preserve_ub_checks]</code> attribute, evaluation is delayed until monomorphization (or until the call gets inlined into a crate that does not delay evaluation further); otherwise it can happen any time.</p> <p>The common case here is a user program built with ub_checks linked against the distributed sysroot which is built without ub_checks but with <code>#[rustc_preserve_ub_checks]</code>. For code that gets monomorphized in the user crate (i.e., generic functions and functions with <code>#[inline]</code>), gating assertions on <code>ub_checks()</code> rather than <code>cfg!(ub_checks)</code> means that assertions are enabled whenever the <em>user crate</em> has UB checks enabled. However, if the user has UB checks disabled, the checks will still get optimized out.
