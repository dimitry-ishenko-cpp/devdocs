<h1 class="main-heading">Keyword as</h1>
<p>Cast between types, or rename an import.</p> <p><code>as</code> is most commonly used to turn primitive types into other primitive types, but it has other uses that include turning pointers into addresses, addresses into pointers, and pointers into other pointers.</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">let thing1: u8 = 89.0 as u8;
assert_eq!('B' as u32, 66);
assert_eq!(thing1 as char, 'Y');
let thing2: f32 = thing1 as f32 + 10.5;
assert_eq!(true as u8 + thing2 as u8, 100);</pre></div> <p>In general, any cast that can be performed via ascribing the type can also be done using <code>as</code>, so instead of writing <code>let x: u32 = 123</code>, you can write <code>let x = 123 as u32</code> (note: <code>let x: u32 = 123</code> would be best in that situation). The same is not true in the other direction, however; explicitly using <code>as</code> allows a few more coercions that aren’t allowed implicitly, such as changing the type of a raw pointer or turning closures into raw pointers.</p> <p><code>as</code> can be seen as the primitive for <code>From</code> and <code>Into</code>: <code>as</code> only works with primitives (<code>u8</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>str</code>, pointers, …) whereas <code>From</code> and <code>Into</code> also works with types like <code>String</code> or <code>Vec</code>.</p> <p><code>as</code> can also be used with the <code>_</code> placeholder when the destination type can be inferred. Note that this can cause inference breakage and usually such code should use an explicit type for both clarity and stability. This is most useful when converting pointers using <code>as *const _</code> or <code>as *mut _</code> though the <a href="primitive.pointer.html#method.cast" title="method pointer::cast"><code>cast</code></a> method is recommended over <code>as *const _</code> and it is <a href="primitive.pointer.html#method.cast-1">the same</a> for <code>as *mut _</code>: those methods make the intent clearer.</p> <p><code>as</code> is also used to rename imports in <a href="keyword.use.html"><code>use</code></a> and <a href="keyword.crate.html"><code>extern crate</code></a> statements:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">use std::{mem as memory, net as network};
// Now you can use the names `memory` and `network` to refer to `std::mem` and `std::net`.</pre></div> <p>For more information on what <code>as</code> is capable of, see the <a href="../reference/expressions/operator-expr.html#type-cast-expressions">Reference</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
