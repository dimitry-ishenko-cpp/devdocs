<h1 class="main-heading">Function std::env::current_exe</h1>
<pre class="rust item-decl" data-language="rust">pub fn current_exe() -&gt; Result&lt;PathBuf&gt;</pre>
<p>Returns the full filesystem path of the current running executable.</p> <h2 id="platform-specific-behavior">Platform-specific behavior</h2> <p>If the executable was invoked through a symbolic link, some platforms will return the path of the symbolic link and other platforms will return the path of the symbolic link’s target.</p> <p>If the executable is renamed while it is running, platforms may return the path at the time it was loaded instead of the new path.</p> <h2 id="errors">Errors</h2> <p>Acquiring the path of the current executable is a platform-specific operation that can fail for a good number of reasons. Some errors can include, but not be limited to, filesystem operations failing or general syscall failures.</p> <h2 id="security">Security</h2> <p>The output of this function should not be trusted for anything that might have security implications. Basically, if users can run the executable, they can change the output arbitrarily.</p> <p>As an example, you can easily introduce a race condition. It goes like this:</p> <ol> <li>You get the path to the current executable using <code>current_exe()</code>, and store it in a variable.</li> <li>Time passes. A malicious actor removes the current executable, and replaces it with a malicious one.</li> <li>You then use the stored path to re-execute the current executable.</li> </ol> <p>You expected to safely execute the current executable, but you’re instead executing something completely different. The code you just executed run with your privileges.</p> <p>This sort of behavior has been known to <a href="https://securityvulns.com/Wdocument183.html">lead to privilege escalation</a> when used incorrectly.</p> <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">use std::env;
