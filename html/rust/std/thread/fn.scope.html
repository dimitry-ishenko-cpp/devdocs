That is: the time during which new scoped threads may be spawned, and also the time during which they might still be running. Once this lifetime ends, all scoped threads are joined. This lifetime starts within the <code>scope</code> function, before <code>f</code> (the argument to <code>scope</code>) starts. It ends after <code>f</code> returns and all scoped threads have been joined, but before <code>scope</code> returns.</p> <p>The <code>'env</code> lifetime represents the lifetime of whatever is borrowed by the scoped threads. This lifetime must outlast the call to <code>scope</code>, and thus cannot be smaller than <code>'scope</code>. It can be as small as the call to <code>scope</code>, meaning that anything that outlives this call, such as local variables defined right before the scope, can be borrowed by the scoped threads.</p> <p>The <code>'env: 'scope</code> bound is part of the definition of the <code>Scope</code> type.</p><div class="_attribution">
