<p>Blocks unless or until the current thread’s token is made available.</p> <p>A call to <code>park</code> does not guarantee that the thread will remain parked forever, and callers should be prepared for this possibility. However, it is guaranteed that this function will not panic (it may abort the process if the implementation encounters some rare errors).</p> <h2 id="park-and-unpark">
<code>park</code> and <code>unpark</code>
</h2> <p>Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via the <a href="fn.park.html" title="fn std::thread::park"><code>thread::park</code></a> function and <a href="struct.thread.html#method.unpark" title="method std::thread::Thread::unpark"><code>thread::Thread::unpark</code></a> method. <a href="fn.park.html" title="fn std::thread::park"><code>park</code></a> blocks the current thread, which can then be resumed from another thread by calling the <a href="struct.thread.html#method.unpark" title="method std::thread::Thread::unpark"><code>unpark</code></a> method on the blocked thread’s handle.</p> <p>Conceptually, each <a href="struct.thread.html" title="struct std::thread::Thread"><code>Thread</code></a> handle has an associated token, which is initially not present:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <a href="fn.park.html" title="fn std::thread::park"><code>thread::park</code></a> function blocks the current thread unless or until the token is available for its thread handle, at which point it atomically consumes the token. It may also return <em>spuriously</em>, without consuming the token. <a href="fn.park_timeout.html" title="fn std::thread::park_timeout"><code>thread::park_timeout</code></a> does the same, but allows specifying a maximum time to block the thread for.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <a href="struct.thread.html#method.unpark" title="method std::thread::Thread::unpark"><code>unpark</code></a> method on a <a href="struct.thread.html" title="struct std::thread::Thread"><code>Thread</code></a> atomically makes the token available if it wasn’t already. Because the token is initially absent, <a href="struct.thread.html#method.unpark" title="method std::thread::Thread::unpark"><code>unpark</code></a> followed by <a href="fn.park.html" title="fn std::thread::park"><code>park</code></a> will result in the second call returning immediately.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The API is typically used by acquiring a handle to the current thread, placing that handle in a shared data structure so that other threads can find it, and then <code>park</code>ing in a loop. When some desired condition is met, another thread calls <a href="struct.thread.html#method.unpark" title="method std::thread::Thread::unpark"><code>unpark</code></a> on the handle.</p> <p>The motivation for this design is twofold:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It avoids the need to allocate mutexes and condvars when building new synchronization primitives; the threads already provide basic blocking/signaling.</p> </li> <li> <p>It can be implemented very efficiently on many platforms.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="memory-ordering">Memory Ordering</h2> <p>Calls to <code>unpark</code> <em>synchronize-with</em> calls to <code>park</code>, meaning that memory operations performed before a call to <code>unpark</code> are made visible to the thread that consumes the token and returns from <code>park</code>. Note that all <code>park</code> and <code>unpark</code> operations for a given thread form a total order and <em>all</em> prior <code>unpark</code> operations synchronize-with <code>park</code>.</p> <p>In atomic ordering terms, <code>unpark</code> performs a <code>Release</code> operation and <code>park</code> performs the corresponding <code>Acquire</code> operation. Calls to <code>unpark</code> for the same thread form a <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order#Release_sequence">release sequence</a>.</p> <p>Note that being unblocked does not imply a call was made to <code>unpark</code>, because wakeups can also be spurious. For example, a valid, but inefficient, implementation could have <code>park</code> and <code>unpark</code> return immediately without doing anything, making <em>all</em> wakeups spurious.</p> <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">use std::thread;
