<p>Recursively create a directory and all of its parent components if they are missing.</p> <p>If this function returns an error, some of the parent components might have been created already.</p> <h2 id="platform-specific-behavior">Platform-specific behavior</h2> <p>This function currently corresponds to multiple calls to the <code>mkdir</code> function on Unix and the <code>CreateDirectoryW</code> function on Windows.</p> <p>Note that, this <a href="../io/index.html#platform-specific-behavior" title="mod std::io">may change in the future</a>.</p> <h2 id="errors">Errors</h2> <p>This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not limited to just these cases:</p> <ul> <li>If any directory in the path specified by <code>path</code> does not already exist and it could not be created otherwise. The specific error conditions for when a directory is being created (after it is determined to not exist) are outlined by <a href="fn.create_dir.html" title="fn std::fs::create_dir"><code>fs::create_dir</code></a>.</li> </ul> <p>Notable exception is made for situations where any of the directories specified in the <code>path</code> could not be created as it was being created concurrently. Such cases are considered to be successful. That is, calling <code>create_dir_all</code> concurrently from multiple threads or processes is guaranteed not to fail due to a race condition with itself.</p> <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">use std::fs;
