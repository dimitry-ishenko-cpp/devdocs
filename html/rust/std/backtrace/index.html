<h1 class="main-heading">Module std::backtrace</h1>
<p>Support for capturing a stack backtrace of an OS thread</p> <p>This module contains the support necessary to capture a stack backtrace of a running OS thread from the OS thread itself. The <code>Backtrace</code> type supports capturing a stack trace via the <code>Backtrace::capture</code> and <code>Backtrace::force_capture</code> functions.</p> <p>A backtrace is typically quite handy to attach to errors (e.g. types implementing <code>std::error::Error</code>) to get a causal chain of where an error was generated.</p> <h3 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h3> <p>Backtraces are attempted to be as accurate as possible, but no guarantees are provided about the exact accuracy of a backtrace. Instruction pointers, symbol names, filenames, line numbers, etc, may all be incorrect when reported. Accuracy is attempted on a best-effort basis, however, any bug reports are always welcome to indicate areas of improvement!</p> <p>For most platforms a backtrace with a filename/line number requires that programs be compiled with debug information. Without debug information filenames/line numbers will not be reported.</p> <h3 id="platform-support">Platform support</h3> <p>Not all platforms that std compiles for support capturing backtraces. Some platforms simply do nothing when capturing a backtrace. To check whether the platform supports capturing backtraces you can consult the <code>BacktraceStatus</code> enum as a result of <code>Backtrace::status</code>.</p> <p>Like above with accuracy platform support is done on a best effort basis. Sometimes libraries might not be available at runtime or something may go wrong which would cause a backtrace to not be captured. Please feel free to report issues with platforms where a backtrace cannot be captured though!</p> <h3 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h3> <p>The <code>Backtrace::capture</code> function might not actually capture a backtrace by default. Its behavior is governed by two environment variables:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE</code> - if this is set to <code>0</code> then <code>Backtrace::capture</code> will never capture a backtrace. Any other value set will enable <code>Backtrace::capture</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> - if <code>RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE</code> is not set, then this variable is consulted with the same rules of <code>RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If neither of the above env vars are set, then <code>Backtrace::capture</code> will be disabled.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Capturing a backtrace can be a quite expensive runtime operation, so the environment variables allow either forcibly disabling this runtime performance hit or allow selectively enabling it in some programs.</p> <p>Note that the <code>Backtrace::force_capture</code> function can be used to ignore these environment variables. Also note that the state of environment variables is cached once the first backtrace is created, so altering <code>RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE</code> or <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> at runtime might not actually change how backtraces are captured.</p> <h3 id="structs" class="section-header">Structs</h3>
