<p>Parses a file as an expression or an item according to the context.</p> <p><strong>Warning</strong>: For multi-file Rust projects, the <code>include!</code> macro is probably not what you are looking for. Usually, multi-file Rust projects use <a href="../reference/items/modules.html">modules</a>. Multi-file projects and modules are explained in the Rust-by-Example book <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/mod/split.html">here</a> and the module system is explained in the Rust Book <a href="../book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html">here</a>.</p> <p>The included file is placed in the surrounding code <a href="../reference/macros-by-example.html#hygiene">unhygienically</a>. If the included file is parsed as an expression and variables or functions share names across both files, it could result in variables or functions being different from what the included file expected.</p> <p>The included file is located relative to the current file (similarly to how modules are found). The provided path is interpreted in a platform-specific way at compile time. So, for instance, an invocation with a Windows path containing backslashes <code>\</code> would not compile correctly on Unix.</p> <h2 id="uses">Uses</h2> <p>The <code>include!</code> macro is primarily used for two purposes. It is used to include documentation that is written in a separate file and it is used to include <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#outputs-of-the-build-script">build artifacts usually as a result from the <code>build.rs</code> script</a>.</p> <p>When using the <code>include</code> macro to include stretches of documentation, remember that the included file still needs to be a valid rust syntax. It is also possible to use the <a href="macro.include_str.html" title="macro std::include_str"><code>include_str</code></a> macro as <code>#![doc = include_str!("...")]</code> (at the module level) or <code>#[doc = include_str!("...")]</code> (at the item level) to include documentation from a plain text or markdown file.</p> <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2> <p>Assume there are two files in the same directory with the following contents:</p> <p>File ‘monkeys.in’:</p> <div class="example-wrap ignore">ⓘ<pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">['🙈', '🙊', '🙉']
    .iter()
    .cycle()
    .take(6)
    .collect::&lt;String&gt;()</pre>
</div> <p>File ‘main.rs’:</p> <div class="example-wrap ignore">ⓘ<pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let my_string = include!("monkeys.in");
    assert_eq!("🙈🙊🙉🙈🙊🙉", my_string);
    println!("{my_string}");
}</pre>
</div> <p>Compiling ‘main.rs’ and running the resulting binary will print “🙈🙊🙉🙈🙊🙉”.</p><div class="_attribution">
