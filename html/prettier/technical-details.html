<p>This printer is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/benjamn/recast">recast</a>’s printer with its algorithm replaced by the one described by Wadler in "<a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf">A prettier printer</a>". There still may be leftover code from recast that needs to be cleaned up.</p> <p>The basic idea is that the printer takes an AST and returns an intermediate representation of the output, and the printer uses that to generate a string. The advantage is that the printer can "measure" the IR and see if the output is going to fit on a line, and break if not.</p> <p>This means that most of the logic of printing an AST involves generating an abstract representation of the output involving certain commands. For example, <code>["(", line, arg, line, ")"]</code> would represent a concatenation of opening parens, an argument, and closing parens. But if that doesn’t fit on one line, the printer can break where <code>line</code> is specified.</p> <p>The <a href="https://prettier.io/playground">Playground</a> has a special mode for exploring how Prettier’s intermediate representation is printed. To get there, open the sidebar (the "Show options" button) and set the <code>parser</code> option to the special value <code>doc-explorer</code>.</p> <p>More (rough) details can be found in <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/main/commands.md">commands.md</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
