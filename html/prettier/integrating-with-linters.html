<h1 id="__docusaurus" class="postHeaderTitle">Integrating with Linters</h1>
<p>Linters usually contain not only code quality rules, but also stylistic rules. Most stylistic rules are unnecessary when using Prettier, but worse – they might conflict with Prettier! Use Prettier for code formatting concerns, and linters for code-quality concerns, as outlined in <a href="comparison.html">Prettier vs. Linters</a>.</p> <p>Luckily it’s easy to turn off rules that conflict or are unnecessary with Prettier, by using these pre-made configs:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier">eslint-config-prettier</a></li> </ul> <p>Check out the above links for instructions on how to install and set things up.</p> <h2 id="notes">
Notes</h2> <p>When searching for both Prettier and your linter on the Internet you’ll probably find more related projects. These are <strong>generally not recommended,</strong> but can be useful in certain circumstances.</p> <p>First, we have plugins that let you run Prettier as if it was a linter rule:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier">eslint-plugin-prettier</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/prettier/stylelint-prettier">stylelint-prettier</a></li> </ul> <p>These plugins were especially useful when Prettier was new. By running Prettier inside your linters, you didn’t have to set up any new infrastructure and you could re-use your editor integrations for the linters. But these days you can run <code>prettier --check .</code> and most editors have Prettier support.</p> <p>The downsides of those plugins are:</p> <ul> <li>You end up with a lot of red squiggly lines in your editor, which gets annoying. Prettier is supposed to make you forget about formatting – and not be in your face about it!</li> <li>They are slower than running Prettier directly.</li> <li>They’re yet one layer of indirection where things may break.</li> </ul> <p>Finally, we have tools that run <code>prettier</code> and then immediately lint files by running, for example, <code>eslint --fix</code> on them.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint">prettier-eslint</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/hugomrdias/prettier-stylelint">prettier-stylelint</a></li> </ul> <p>Those are useful if some aspect of Prettier’s output makes Prettier completely unusable to you. Then you can have for example <code>eslint --fix</code> fix that up for you. The downside is that these tools are much slower than just running Prettier.</p><div class="_attribution">
