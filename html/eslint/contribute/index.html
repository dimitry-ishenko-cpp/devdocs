ESLint couldn’t exist without the help of the many contributors it’s had since the project began, and we want you to feel like you can contribute and make a difference as well.</p> <p>This guide is intended for anyone who wants to contribute to an ESLint project. Please read it carefully as it answers a lot of the questions many newcomers have when first working with our projects.</p> <h2 id="read-the-code-of-conduct" tabindex="-1">Read the <a href="https://eslint.org/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>
