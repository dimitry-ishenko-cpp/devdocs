Most CMSes give you a visual content editor, the ability to specify standard types of content, and a way to collaborate with others.</p> <p>A CMS can be useful for content that follows a particular structure, often giving you a dashboard-like experience and WYSIWYG editing tools. You might use a CMS to write blog posts using a CMS’s rich text editor instead of Markdown files. Or you might use a CMS to maintain product listings for an eCommerce shop, making certain fields required to avoid incomplete listings.</p> <p>Your Astro project can then fetch your content from your CMS and display it, wherever and however you want on your site.</p> <div tabindex="-1" class="heading-wrapper level-h2"><h2 id="which-cmses-work-well-with-astro">Which CMSes work well with Astro?</h2></div> <p>Because Astro takes care of the <em>presentation</em> of your content, you’ll want to choose a <em>headless</em> CMS, like those in the list above. This means that the CMS helps you write your content, but doesn’t generate a site that displays it. Instead, you fetch the content data and use in your Astro project.</p> <p>Some headless CMSes, like Storyblok, provide an Astro <a href="../integrations-guide/index.html">integration</a> that helps fetch the content specifically for an Astro site. Others provide a JavaScript SDK, a library that you install and use to fetch your remote content.</p> <div tabindex="-1" class="heading-wrapper level-h2"><h2 id="can-i-use-astro-without-a-cms">Can I use Astro without a CMS?</h2></div> <p>Yes! Astro provides built-in ways to <a href="../content/index.html">author content</a>, including support for Markdown pages.</p><div class="_attribution">
