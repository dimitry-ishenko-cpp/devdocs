Reviewing PRs and leaving comments, suggestions, or an approving “LGTM!” (“Looks Good To Me!”) is a great way to get started in any repository, and to learn more about Astro.</p> <p>We also have a very active <a href="https://astro.build/chat">Discord</a> community! We value the contributions of those who welcome new members, answer support questions, and share what they have built with and for Astro!
