<h1>Overview</h1>  <h2 id="what-graphite-is-and-is-not">What Graphite is and is not</h2> <p>Graphite does two things:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>Store numeric time-series data</li> <li>Render graphs of this data on demand</li> </ol> <p>What Graphite does not do is collect data for you, however there are some <a class="reference internal" href="tools.html"><span class="doc">tools</span></a> out there that know how to send data to graphite. Even though it often requires a little code, <a class="reference internal" href="feeding-carbon.html"><span class="doc">sending data</span></a> to Graphite is very simple.</p>   <h2 id="about-the-project">About the project</h2> <p>Graphite is an enterprise-scale monitoring tool that runs well on cheap hardware. It was originally designed and written by <a class="reference external" href="mailto:chrismd%40gmail.com.html">Chris Davis</a> at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.orbitz.com/">Orbitz</a> in 2006 as side project that ultimately grew to be a foundational monitoring tool. In 2008, Orbitz allowed Graphite to be released under the open source Apache 2.0 license. Since then Chris has continued to work on Graphite and has deployed it at other companies including <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sears.com/">Sears</a>, where it serves as a pillar of the e-commerce monitoring system. Today many large <a class="reference internal" href="https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/who-is-using.html"><span class="doc">companies</span></a> use it.</p>   <h2 id="the-architecture-in-a-nutshell">The architecture in a nutshell</h2> <p>Graphite consists of 3 software components:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>
<strong>carbon</strong> - a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> daemon that listens for time-series data</li> <li>
<strong>whisper</strong> - a simple database library for storing time-series data (similar in design to <a class="reference external" href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRD</a>)</li> <li>
<strong>graphite webapp</strong> - A <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> webapp that renders graphs on-demand using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo</a>
</li> </ol> <p><a class="reference internal" href="feeding-carbon.html"><span class="doc">Feeding in your data</span></a> is pretty easy, typically most of the effort is in collecting the data to begin with. As you send datapoints to Carbon, they become immediately available for graphing in the webapp. The webapp offers several ways to create and display graphs including a simple <a class="reference internal" href="render_api.html"><span class="doc">URL API</span></a> for rendering that makes it easy to embed graphs in other webpages.</p><div class="_attribution">
