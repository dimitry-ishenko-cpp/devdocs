<h1>Graphite Events</h1> <p>Graphite is well known for storing simple key/value metrics using the Whisper time-series database on-disk format. What is not well known about Graphite is that it also ships with a feature known as <strong>Events</strong> that supports a richer form of metrics storage suitable for irregular events often associated with metadata.</p> <p>Examples of data appropriate for this storage format include releases, commits, application exceptions, and state changes where you may wish to track or correlate the event with traditional time-series activity.</p>  <h2 id="database-storage">Database Storage</h2> <p>As Whisper was designed to hold simple time-series data (metric key, value, and timestamp), it’s altogether unsuitable for storing rich metric data such as events. Many users continue to store simple event-type data (e.g. releases, state changes, etc) in Whisper by encoding its meaning within the metric namespace and rendering them as a vertical line with Graphite’s <a class="reference external" href="functions.html#graphite.render.functions.drawAsInfinite">drawAsInfinite</a> function.</p> <p>However, taking advantage of this pattern typically requires the use of wildcards across a significant number of these singleton metric files and directories, which can cause a significant performance hit on the server and result in a poor experience for users. To accommodate this more sophisticated use case, Graphite’s webapp database was extended to support this new metric type.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">Events require Graphite webapp version 0.9.9 or newer.</p> </div>   <h2 id="adding-events">Adding Events</h2> <p>Events can be submitted via HTTP POST using command-line tools such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">curl</span></code> or with a variety of HTTP programming libraries.

By default, Graphite uses a “lazy union” that will return any matching events for a given tag in a list of tags. This behavior is not intuitive and will therefore be deprecated in a future release.</p>   <h2 id="managing-events-in-the-admin-ui">Managing Events in the Admin UI</h2> <p>Events can be managed using the Graphite <a class="reference external" href="admin-webapp.html">administration module</a>. This is particularly handy for deleting a large number of events at once, although it also supports adding and editing individual events.</p><div class="_attribution">
