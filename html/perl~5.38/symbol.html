Such a glob reference can be used as a file or directory handle.</p> <p>For backward compatibility with older implementations that didn't support anonymous globs, <code>Symbol::ungensym</code> is also provided. But it doesn't do anything.</p> <p><code>Symbol::geniosym</code> creates an anonymous IO handle. This can be assigned into an existing glob without affecting the non-IO portions of the glob.</p> <p><code>Symbol::qualify</code> turns unqualified symbol names into qualified variable names (e.g. "myvar" -&gt; "MyPackage::myvar"). If it is given a second parameter, <code>qualify</code> uses it as the default package; otherwise, it uses the package of its caller. Regardless, global variable names (e.g. "STDOUT", "ENV", "SIG") are always qualified with "main::".</p> <p>Qualification applies only to symbol names (strings). References are left unchanged under the assumption that they are glob references, which are qualified by their nature.</p> <p><code>Symbol::qualify_to_ref</code> is just like <code>Symbol::qualify</code> except that it returns a glob ref rather than a symbol name, so you can use the result even if <code>use strict 'refs'</code> is in effect.</p> <p><code>Symbol::delete_package</code> wipes out a whole package namespace. Note this routine is not exported by default--you may want to import it explicitly.</p> <h2 id="BUGS">BUGS</h2> <p><code>Symbol::delete_package</code> is a bit too powerful. It undefines every symbol that lives in the specified package. Since perl, for performance reasons, does not perform a symbol table lookup each time a function is called or a global variable is accessed, some code that has already been loaded and that makes use of symbols in package <code>Foo</code> may stop working after you delete <code>Foo</code>, even if you reload the <code>Foo</code> module afterwards.</p><div class="_attribution">
