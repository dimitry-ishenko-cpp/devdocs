See the <a href="#EXAMPLES">"EXAMPLES"</a> section below and the test scripts for usage; see your system documentation for the description of the underlying <code>nanosleep</code> or <code>usleep</code>, <code>ualarm</code>, <code>gettimeofday</code>, and <code>setitimer</code>/<code>getitimer</code> calls.</p> <p>If your system lacks <code>gettimeofday()</code> or an emulation of it you don't get <code>gettimeofday()</code> or the one-argument form of <code>tv_interval()</code>. If your system lacks all of <code>nanosleep()</code>, <code>usleep()</code>, <code>select()</code>, and <code>poll</code>, you don't get <code>Time::HiRes::usleep()</code>, <code>Time::HiRes::nanosleep()</code>, or <code>Time::HiRes::sleep()</code>. If your system lacks both <code>ualarm()</code> and <code>setitimer()</code> you don't get <code>Time::HiRes::ualarm()</code> or <code>Time::HiRes::alarm()</code>.</p> <p>If you try to import an unimplemented function in the <code>use</code> statement it will fail at compile time.</p> <p>If your subsecond sleeping is implemented with <code>nanosleep()</code> instead of <code>usleep()</code>, you can mix subsecond sleeping with signals since <code>nanosleep()</code> does not use signals. This, however, is not portable, and you should first check for the truth value of <code>&amp;Time::HiRes::d_nanosleep</code> to see whether you have nanosleep, and then carefully read your <code>nanosleep()</code> C API documentation for any peculiarities.</p> <p>If you are using <code>nanosleep</code> for something else than mixing sleeping with signals, give some thought to whether Perl is the tool you should be using for work requiring nanosecond accuracies.</p> <p>Remember that unless you are working on a <i>hard realtime</i> system, any clocks and timers will be imprecise, especially so if you are working in a pre-emptive multiuser system. Understand the difference between <i>wallclock time</i> and process time (in UNIX-like systems the sum of <i>user</i> and <i>system</i> times). Any attempt to sleep for X seconds will most probably end up sleeping <b>more</b> than that, but don't be surprised if you end up sleeping slightly <b>less</b>.</p> <p>The following functions can be imported from this module. No functions are exported by default.</p> <dl> <dt id="gettimeofday-()">
gettimeofday ()</dt> <dd> <p>In array context returns a two-element array with the seconds and microseconds since the epoch. In scalar context returns floating seconds like <code>Time::HiRes::time()</code> (see below).</p> </dd> <dt id="usleep-(-$useconds-)">

See also <a href="#clock_getres">"clock_getres"</a>, if available in your system.</p> <p><b>NOTE 2</b>: Since Sunday, September 9th, 2001 at 01:46:40 AM GMT, when the <code>time()</code> seconds since epoch rolled over to 1_000_000_000, the default floating point format of Perl and the seconds since epoch have conspired to produce an apparent bug: if you print the value of <code>Time::HiRes::time()</code> you seem to be getting only five decimals, not six as promised (microseconds). Not to worry, the microseconds are there (assuming your platform supports such granularity in the first place). What is going on is that the default floating point format of Perl only outputs 15 digits. In this case that means ten digits before the decimal separator and five after. To see the microseconds you can use either <code>printf</code>/<code>sprintf</code> with <code>"%.6f"</code>, or the <code>gettimeofday()</code> function in list context, which will give you the seconds and microseconds as two separate values.</p> </dd> <dt id="sleep-(-$floating_seconds-)">

setitimer ( $which, $floating_seconds [, $interval_floating_seconds ] )</dt> <dd> <p>Start up an interval timer: after a certain time, a signal ($which) arrives, and more signals may keep arriving at certain intervals. To disable an "itimer", use <code>$floating_seconds</code> of zero. If the <code>$interval_floating_seconds</code> is set to zero (or unspecified), the timer is disabled <b>after</b> the next delivered signal.</p> <p>Use of interval timers may interfere with <code>alarm()</code>, <code>sleep()</code>, and <code>usleep()</code>. In standard-speak the "interaction is unspecified", which means that <i>anything</i> may happen: it may work, it may not.</p> <p>In scalar context, the remaining time in the timer is returned.</p> <p>In list context, both the remaining time and the interval are returned.</p> <p>There are usually three or four interval timers (signals) available: the <code>$which</code> can be <code>ITIMER_REAL</code>, <code>ITIMER_VIRTUAL</code>, <code>ITIMER_PROF</code>, or <code>ITIMER_REALPROF</code>. Note that which ones are available depends: true UNIX platforms usually have the first three, but only Solaris seems to have <code>ITIMER_REALPROF</code> (which is used to profile multithreaded programs). Win32 unfortunately does not have interval timers.</p> <p><code>ITIMER_REAL</code> results in <code>alarm()</code>-like behaviour. Time is counted in <i>real time</i>; that is, wallclock time. <code>SIGALRM</code> is delivered when the timer expires.</p> <p><code>ITIMER_VIRTUAL</code> counts time in (process) <i>virtual time</i>; that is, only when the process is running. In multiprocessor/user/CPU systems this may be more or less than real or wallclock time. (This time is also known as the <i>user time</i>.) <code>SIGVTALRM</code> is delivered when the timer expires.</p> <p><code>ITIMER_PROF</code> counts time when either the process virtual time or when the operating system is running on behalf of the process (such as I/O). (This time is also known as the <i>system time</i>.) (The sum of user time and system time is known as the <i>CPU time</i>.) <code>SIGPROF</code> is delivered when the timer expires. <code>SIGPROF</code> can interrupt system calls.</p> <p>The semantics of interval timers for multithreaded programs are system-specific, and some systems may support additional interval timers.

Do not assume that CLOCK_REALTIME is zero, it might be one, or something else. Another potentially useful (but not available everywhere) value is <code>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code>, which guarantees a monotonically increasing time value (unlike time() or gettimeofday(), which can be adjusted).

Even if the resolution is high (a small number), all it means is that you'll be able to specify the arguments to clock_gettime() and clock_nanosleep() with that resolution.

clock_nanosleep ( $which, $nanoseconds, $flags = 0)</dt> <dd> <p>Sleeps for the number of nanoseconds (1e9ths of a second) specified. Returns the number of nanoseconds actually slept. The $which is the "clock id", as with clock_gettime() and clock_getres(). The flags default to zero but <code>TIMER_ABSTIME</code> can specified (must be exported explicitly) which means that <code>$nanoseconds</code> is not a time interval (as is the default) but instead an absolute time. Can sleep for more than one second. Can also sleep for zero seconds, which often works like a <i>thread yield</i>.
