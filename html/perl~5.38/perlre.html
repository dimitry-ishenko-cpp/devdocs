The Basics </h3> <p>Regular expressions are strings with the very particular syntax and meaning described in this document and auxiliary documents referred to by this one. The strings are called "patterns". Patterns are used to determine if some other string, called the "target", has (or doesn't have) the characteristics specified by the pattern. We call this "matching" the target string against the pattern. Usually the match is done by having the target be the first operand, and the pattern be the second operand, of one of the two binary operators <code>=~</code> and <code>!~</code>, listed in <a href="perlop.html#Binding-Operators">"Binding Operators" in perlop</a>; and the pattern will have been converted from an ordinary string by one of the operators in <a href="perlop.html#Regexp-Quote-Like-Operators">"Regexp Quote-Like Operators" in perlop</a>, like so:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$foo =~ m/abc/</code></pre> <p>This evaluates to true if and only if the string in the variable <code>$foo</code> contains somewhere in it, the sequence of characters "a", "b", then "c". (The <code>=~ m</code>, or match operator, is described in <a href="perlop.html#m%2FPATTERN%2Fmsixpodualngc">"m/PATTERN/msixpodualngc" in perlop</a>.)</p> <p>Patterns that aren't already stored in some variable must be delimited, at both ends, by delimiter characters. These are often, as in the example above, forward slashes, and the typical way a pattern is written in documentation is with those slashes. In most cases, the delimiter is the same character, fore and aft, but there are a few cases where a character looks like it has a mirror-image mate, where the opening version is the beginning delimiter, and the closing one is the ending delimiter, like</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$foo =~ m&lt;abc&gt;</code></pre> <p>Most times, the pattern is evaluated in double-quotish context, but it is possible to choose delimiters to force single-quotish, like</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$foo =~ m'abc'</code></pre> <p>If the pattern contains its delimiter within it, that delimiter must be escaped. Prefixing it with a backslash (<i>e.g.</i>, <code>"/foo\/bar/"</code>) serves this purpose.</p> <p>Any single character in a pattern matches that same character in the target string, unless the character is a <i>metacharacter</i> with a special meaning described in this document. A sequence of non-metacharacters matches the same sequence in the target string, as we saw above with <code>m/abc/</code>.</p> <p>Only a few characters (all of them being ASCII punctuation characters) are metacharacters. The most commonly used one is a dot <code>"."</code>, which normally matches almost any character (including a dot itself).</p> <p>You can cause characters that normally function as metacharacters to be interpreted literally by prefixing them with a <code>"\"</code>, just like the pattern's delimiter must be escaped if it also occurs within the pattern. Thus, <code>"\."</code> matches just a literal dot, <code>"."</code> instead of its normal meaning. This means that the backslash is also a metacharacter, so <code>"\\"</code> matches a single <code>"\"</code>. And a sequence that contains an escaped metacharacter matches the same sequence (but without the escape) in the target string. So, the pattern <code>/blur\\fl/</code> would match any target string that contains the sequence <code>"blur\fl"</code>.</p> <p>The metacharacter <code>"|"</code> is used to match one thing or another. Thus</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$foo =~ m/this|that/</code></pre> <p>is TRUE if and only if <code>$foo</code> contains either the sequence <code>"this"</code> or the sequence <code>"that"</code>. Like all metacharacters, prefixing the <code>"|"</code> with a backslash makes it match the plain punctuation character; in its case, the VERTICAL LINE.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$foo =~ m/this\|that/</code></pre> <p>is TRUE if and only if <code>$foo</code> contains the sequence <code>"this|that"</code>.</p> <p>You aren't limited to just a single <code>"|"</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$foo =~ m/fee|fie|foe|fum/</code></pre> <p>is TRUE if and only if <code>$foo</code> contains any of those 4 sequences from the children's story "Jack and the Beanstalk".</p> <p>As you can see, the <code>"|"</code> binds less tightly than a sequence of ordinary characters. We can override this by using the grouping metacharacters, the parentheses <code>"("</code> and <code>")"</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$foo =~ m/th(is|at) thing/</code></pre> <p>is TRUE if and only if <code>$foo</code> contains either the sequence <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>"this thing"</code></span> or the sequence <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>"that thing"</code></span>. The portions of the string that match the portions of the pattern enclosed in parentheses are normally made available separately for use later in the pattern, substitution, or program. This is called "capturing", and it can get complicated. See <a href="#Capture-groups">"Capture groups"</a>.</p> <p>The first alternative includes everything from the last pattern delimiter (<code>"("</code>, <code>"(?:"</code> (described later), <i>etc</i>. or the beginning of the pattern) up to the first <code>"|"</code>, and the last alternative contains everything from the last <code>"|"</code> to the next closing pattern delimiter. That's why it's common practice to include alternatives in parentheses: to minimize confusion about where they start and end.</p> <p>Alternatives are tried from left to right, so the first alternative found for which the entire expression matches, is the one that is chosen. This means that alternatives are not necessarily greedy. For example: when matching <code>foo|foot</code> against <code>"barefoot"</code>, only the <code>"foo"</code> part will match, as that is the first alternative tried, and it successfully matches the target string. (This might not seem important, but it is important when you are capturing matched text using parentheses.)</p> <p>Besides taking away the special meaning of a metacharacter, a prefixed backslash changes some letter and digit characters away from matching just themselves to instead have special meaning. These are called "escape sequences", and all such are described in <a href="perlrebackslash.html">perlrebackslash</a>. A backslash sequence (of a letter or digit) that doesn't currently have special meaning to Perl will raise a warning if warnings are enabled, as those are reserved for potential future use.</p> <p>One such sequence is <code>\b</code>, which matches a boundary of some sort. <code>\b{wb}</code> and a few others give specialized types of boundaries. (They are all described in detail starting at <a href="perlrebackslash.html#%5Cb%7B%7D%2C-%5Cb%2C-%5CB%7B%7D%2C-%5CB">"\b{}, \b, \B{}, \B" in perlrebackslash</a>.) Note that these don't match characters, but the zero-width spaces between characters. They are an example of a <a href="#Assertions">zero-width assertion</a>. Consider again,</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$foo =~ m/fee|fie|foe|fum/</code></pre> <p>It evaluates to TRUE if, besides those 4 words, any of the sequences "feed", "field", "Defoe", "fume", and many others are in <code>$foo</code>. By judicious use of <code>\b</code> (or better (because it is designed to handle natural language) <code>\b{wb}</code>), we can make sure that only the Giant's words are matched:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$foo =~ m/\b(fee|fie|foe|fum)\b/
$foo =~ m/\b{wb}(fee|fie|foe|fum)\b{wb}/</code></pre> <p>The final example shows that the characters <code>"{"</code> and <code>"}"</code> are metacharacters.</p> <p>Another use for escape sequences is to specify characters that cannot (or which you prefer not to) be written literally. These are described in detail in <a href="perlrebackslash.html#Character-Escapes">"Character Escapes" in perlrebackslash</a>, but the next three paragraphs briefly describe some of them.</p> <p>Various control characters can be written in C language style: <code>"\n"</code> matches a newline, <code>"\t"</code> a tab, <code>"\r"</code> a carriage return, <code>"\f"</code> a form feed, <i>etc</i>.</p> <p>More generally, <code>\<i>nnn</i></code>, where <i>nnn</i> is a string of three octal digits, matches the character whose native code point is <i>nnn</i>. You can easily run into trouble if you don't have exactly three digits. So always use three, or since Perl 5.14, you can use <code>\o{...}</code> to specify any number of octal digits.</p> <p>Similarly, <code>\x<i>nn</i></code>, where <i>nn</i> are hexadecimal digits, matches the character whose native ordinal is <i>nn</i>. Again, not using exactly two digits is a recipe for disaster, but you can use <code>\x{...}</code> to specify any number of hex digits.</p> <p>Besides being a metacharacter, the <code>"."</code> is an example of a "character class", something that can match any single character of a given set of them. In its case, the set is just about all possible characters. Perl predefines several character classes besides the <code>"."</code>; there is a separate reference page about just these, <a href="perlrecharclass.html">perlrecharclass</a>.</p> <p>You can define your own custom character classes, by putting into your pattern in the appropriate place(s), a list of all the characters you want in the set. You do this by enclosing the list within <code>[]</code> bracket characters. These are called "bracketed character classes" when we are being precise, but often the word "bracketed" is dropped. (Dropping it usually doesn't cause confusion.) This means that the <code>"["</code> character is another metacharacter. It doesn't match anything just by itself; it is used only to tell Perl that what follows it is a bracketed character class. If you want to match a literal left square bracket, you must escape it, like <code>"\["</code>. The matching <code>"]"</code> is also a metacharacter; again it doesn't match anything by itself, but just marks the end of your custom class to Perl. It is an example of a "sometimes metacharacter". It isn't a metacharacter if there is no corresponding <code>"["</code>, and matches its literal self:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "]" =~ /]/;  # prints 1</code></pre> <p>The list of characters within the character class gives the set of characters matched by the class. <code>"[abc]"</code> matches a single "a" or "b" or "c". But if the first character after the <code>"["</code> is <code>"^"</code>, the class instead matches any character not in the list. Within a list, the <code>"-"</code> character specifies a range of characters, so that <code>a-z</code> represents all characters between "a" and "z", inclusive. If you want either <code>"-"</code> or <code>"]"</code> itself to be a member of a class, put it at the start of the list (possibly after a <code>"^"</code>), or escape it with a backslash. <code>"-"</code> is also taken literally when it is at the end of the list, just before the closing <code>"]"</code>. (The following all specify the same class of three characters: <code>[-az]</code>, <code>[az-]</code>, and <code>[a\-z]</code>. All are different from <code>[a-z]</code>, which specifies a class containing twenty-six characters, even on EBCDIC-based character sets.)</p> <p>There is lots more to bracketed character classes; full details are in <a href="perlrecharclass.html#Bracketed-Character-Classes">"Bracketed Character Classes" in perlrecharclass</a>.</p> <h4 id="Metacharacters">Metacharacters </h4> <p><a href="#The-Basics">"The Basics"</a> introduced some of the metacharacters. This section gives them all. Most of them have the same meaning as in the <i>egrep</i> command.</p> <p>Only the <code>"\"</code> is always a metacharacter. The others are metacharacters just sometimes. The following tables lists all of them, summarizes their use, and gives the contexts where they are metacharacters. Outside those contexts or if prefixed by a <code>"\"</code>, they match their corresponding punctuation character. In some cases, their meaning varies depending on various pattern modifiers that alter the default behaviors. See <a href="#Modifiers">"Modifiers"</a>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>           PURPOSE                                  WHERE

#   Beginning of comment, extends to line end    Only with /x modifier</code></pre> <p>Notice that most of the metacharacters lose their special meaning when they occur in a bracketed character class, except <code>"^"</code> has a different meaning when it is at the beginning of such a class. And <code>"-"</code> and <code>"]"</code> are metacharacters only at restricted positions within bracketed character classes; while <code>"}"</code> is a metacharacter only when closing a special construct started by <code>"{"</code>.</p> <p>In double-quotish context, as is usually the case, you need to be careful about <code>"$"</code> and the non-metacharacter <code>"@"</code>. Those could interpolate variables, which may or may not be what you intended.</p> <p>These rules were designed for compactness of expression, rather than legibility and maintainability. The <a href="#%2Fx-and-%2Fxx">"/x and /xx"</a> pattern modifiers allow you to insert white space to improve readability. And use of <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code><a href="re.html#%27strict%27-mode">re 'strict'</a></code></span> adds extra checking to catch some typos that might silently compile into something unintended.</p> <p>By default, the <code>"^"</code> character is guaranteed to match only the beginning of the string, the <code>"$"</code> character only the end (or before the newline at the end), and Perl does certain optimizations with the assumption that the string contains only one line. Embedded newlines will not be matched by <code>"^"</code> or <code>"$"</code>. You may, however, wish to treat a string as a multi-line buffer, such that the <code>"^"</code> will match after any newline within the string (except if the newline is the last character in the string), and <code>"$"</code> will match before any newline. At the cost of a little more overhead, you can do this by using the <code><a href="#%2Fm">"/m"</a></code> modifier on the pattern match operator. (Older programs did this by setting <code>$*</code>, but this option was removed in perl 5.10.) </p> <p>To simplify multi-line substitutions, the <code>"."</code> character never matches a newline unless you use the <a href="#s"><code>/s</code></a> modifier, which in effect tells Perl to pretend the string is a single line--even if it isn't. </p> <h3 id="Modifiers">Modifiers</h3> <h4 id="Overview">Overview</h4> <p>The default behavior for matching can be changed, using various modifiers. Modifiers that relate to the interpretation of the pattern are listed just below. Modifiers that alter the way a pattern is used by Perl are detailed in <a href="perlop.html#Regexp-Quote-Like-Operators">"Regexp Quote-Like Operators" in perlop</a> and <a href="perlop.html#Gory-details-of-parsing-quoted-constructs">"Gory details of parsing quoted constructs" in perlop</a>. Modifiers can be added dynamically; see <a href="#Extended-Patterns">"Extended Patterns"</a> below.</p> <dl> <dt id="m">
<b><code>m</code></b> </dt> <dd> <p>Treat the string being matched against as multiple lines. That is, change <code>"^"</code> and <code>"$"</code> from matching the start of the string's first line and the end of its last line to matching the start and end of each line within the string.</p> </dd> <dt id="s">
<b><code>s</code></b> </dt> <dd> <p>Treat the string as single line. That is, change <code>"."</code> to match any character whatsoever, even a newline, which normally it would not match.</p> <p>Used together, as <code>/ms</code>, they let the <code>"."</code> match any character whatsoever, while still allowing <code>"^"</code> and <code>"$"</code> to match, respectively, just after and just before newlines within the string.</p> </dd> <dt id="i">
<b><code>i</code></b> </dt> <dd> <p>Do case-insensitive pattern matching. For example, "A" will match "a" under <code>/i</code>.</p> <p>If locale matching rules are in effect, the case map is taken from the current locale for code points less than 255, and from Unicode rules for larger code points. However, matches that would cross the Unicode rules/non-Unicode rules boundary (ords 255/256) will not succeed, unless the locale is a UTF-8 one. See <a href="perllocale.html">perllocale</a>.</p> <p>There are a number of Unicode characters that match a sequence of multiple characters under <code>/i</code>. For example, <code>LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI</code> should match the sequence <code>fi</code>. Perl is not currently able to do this when the multiple characters are in the pattern and are split between groupings, or when one or more are quantified. Thus</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>"\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}" =~ /fi/i;          # Matches
"\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}" =~ /[fi][fi]/i;    # Doesn't match!
"\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}" =~ /fi*/i;         # Doesn't match!

# The below doesn't match, and it isn't clear what $1 and $2 would
# be even if it did!!
"\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}" =~ /(f)(i)/i;      # Doesn't match!</code></pre> <p>Perl doesn't match multiple characters in a bracketed character class unless the character that maps to them is explicitly mentioned, and it doesn't match them at all if the character class is inverted, which otherwise could be highly confusing.

<code>/x</code> and <code>/xx</code>
</h5> <p>A single <code>/x</code> tells the regular expression parser to ignore most whitespace that is neither backslashed nor within a bracketed character class, nor within the characters of a multi-character metapattern like <code>(?i: ... )</code>. You can use this to break up your regular expression into more readable parts. Also, the <code>"#"</code> character is treated as a metacharacter introducing a comment that runs up to the pattern's closing delimiter, or to the end of the current line if the pattern extends onto the next line. Hence, this is very much like an ordinary Perl code comment. (You can include the closing delimiter within the comment only if you precede it with a backslash, so be careful!)</p> <p>Use of <code>/x</code> means that if you want real whitespace or <code>"#"</code> characters in the pattern (outside a bracketed character class, which is unaffected by <code>/x</code>), then you'll either have to escape them (using backslashes or <code>\Q...\E</code>) or encode them using octal, hex, or <code>\N{}</code> or <code>\p{name=...}</code> escapes. It is ineffective to try to continue a comment onto the next line by escaping the <code>\n</code> with a backslash or <code>\Q</code>.</p> <p>You can use <a href="#%28%3F%23text%29">"(?#text)"</a> to create a comment that ends earlier than the end of the current line, but <code>text</code> also can't contain the closing delimiter unless escaped with a backslash.</p> <p>A common pitfall is to forget that <code>"#"</code> characters (outside a bracketed character class) begin a comment under <code>/x</code> and are not matched literally. Just keep that in mind when trying to puzzle out why a particular <code>/x</code> pattern isn't working as expected. Inside a bracketed character class, <code>"#"</code> retains its non-special, literal meaning.</p> <p>Starting in Perl v5.26, if the modifier has a second <code>"x"</code> within it, the effect of a single <code>/x</code> is increased. The only difference is that inside bracketed character classes, non-escaped (by a backslash) SPACE and TAB characters are not added to the class, and hence can be inserted to make the classes more readable:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">/ [d-e g-i 3-7]/xx
/[ ! @ " # $ % ^ &amp; * () = ? &lt;&gt; ' ]/xx</code></pre> <p>may be easier to grasp than the squashed equivalents</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">/[d-eg-i3-7]/
/[!@"#$%^&amp;*()=?&lt;&gt;']/</code></pre> <p>Note that this unfortunately doesn't mean that your bracketed classes can contain comments or extend over multiple lines. A <code>#</code> inside a character class is still just a literal <code>#</code>, and doesn't introduce a comment. And, unless the closing bracket is on the same line as the opening one, the newline character (and everything on the next line(s) until terminated by a <code>]</code> will be part of the class, just as if you'd written <code>\n</code>.</p> <p>Taken together, these features go a long way towards making Perl's regular expressions more readable. Here's an example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>    # Delete (most) C comments.
    $program =~ s {
	/\*	# Match the opening delimiter.
	.*?	# Match a minimal number of characters.
	\*/	# Match the closing delimiter.
    } []gsx;</code></pre> <p>Note that anything inside a <code>\Q...\E</code> stays unaffected by <code>/x</code>. And note that <code>/x</code> doesn't affect space interpretation within a single multi-character construct. For example <code>(?:...)</code> can't have a space between the <code>"("</code>, <code>"?"</code>, and <code>":"</code>. Within any delimiters for such a construct, allowed spaces are not affected by <code>/x</code>, and depend on the construct. For example, all constructs using curly braces as delimiters, such as <code>\x{...}</code> can have blanks within but adjacent to the braces, but not elsewhere, and no non-blank space characters. An exception are Unicode properties which follow Unicode rules, for which see <a href="perluniprops.html#Properties-accessible-through-%5Cp%7B%7D-and-%5CP%7B%7D">"Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}" in perluniprops</a>. </p> <p>The set of characters that are deemed whitespace are those that Unicode calls "Pattern White Space", namely:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION

Character set modifiers</h5> <p><code>/d</code>, <code>/u</code>, <code>/a</code>, and <code>/l</code>, available starting in 5.14, are called the character set modifiers; they affect the character set rules used for the regular expression.</p> <p>The <code>/d</code>, <code>/u</code>, and <code>/l</code> modifiers are not likely to be of much use to you, and so you need not worry about them very much. They exist for Perl's internal use, so that complex regular expression data structures can be automatically serialized and later exactly reconstituted, including all their nuances. But, since Perl can't keep a secret, and there may be rare instances where they are useful, they are documented here.</p> <p>The <code>/a</code> modifier, on the other hand, may be useful. Its purpose is to allow code that is to work mostly on ASCII data to not have to concern itself with Unicode.</p> <p>Briefly, <code>/l</code> sets the character set to that of whatever <b>L</b>ocale is in effect at the time of the execution of the pattern match.</p> <p><code>/u</code> sets the character set to <b>U</b>nicode.</p> <p><code>/a</code> also sets the character set to Unicode, BUT adds several restrictions for <b>A</b>SCII-safe matching.</p> <p><code>/d</code> is the old, problematic, pre-5.14 <b>D</b>efault character set behavior. Its only use is to force that old behavior.</p> <p>At any given time, exactly one of these modifiers is in effect. Their existence allows Perl to keep the originally compiled behavior of a regular expression, regardless of what rules are in effect when it is actually executed. And if it is interpolated into a larger regex, the original's rules continue to apply to it, and don't affect the other parts.</p> <p>The <code>/l</code> and <code>/u</code> modifiers are automatically selected for regular expressions compiled within the scope of various pragmas, and we recommend that in general, you use those pragmas instead of specifying these modifiers explicitly. For one thing, the modifiers affect only pattern matching, and do not extend to even any replacement done, whereas using the pragmas gives consistent results for all appropriate operations within their scopes. For example,</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">s/foo/\Ubar/il</code></pre> <p>will match "foo" using the locale's rules for case-insensitive matching, but the <code>/l</code> does not affect how the <code>\U</code> operates. Most likely you want both of them to use locale rules. To do this, instead compile the regular expression within the scope of <code>use locale</code>. This both implicitly adds the <code>/l</code>, and applies locale rules to the <code>\U</code>. The lesson is to <code>use locale</code>, and not <code>/l</code> explicitly.</p> <p>Similarly, it would be better to use <code>use feature 'unicode_strings'</code> instead of,</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">s/foo/\Lbar/iu</code></pre> <p>to get Unicode rules, as the <code>\L</code> in the former (but not necessarily the latter) would also use Unicode rules.</p> <p>More detail on each of the modifiers follows. Most likely you don't need to know this detail for <code>/l</code>, <code>/u</code>, and <code>/d</code>, and can skip ahead to <a href="#%2Fa-%28and-%2Faa%29">/a</a>.</p> <h5 id="/l">
/l</h5> <p>means to use the current locale's rules (see <a href="perllocale.html">perllocale</a>) when pattern matching. For example, <code>\w</code> will match the "word" characters of that locale, and <code>"/i"</code> case-insensitive matching will match according to the locale's case folding rules. The locale used will be the one in effect at the time of execution of the pattern match. This may not be the same as the compilation-time locale, and can differ from one match to another if there is an intervening call of the <a href="perllocale.html#The-setlocale-function">setlocale() function</a>.</p> <p>Prior to v5.20, Perl did not support multi-byte locales. Starting then, UTF-8 locales are supported. No other multi byte locales are ever likely to be supported. However, in all locales, one can have code points above 255 and these will always be treated as Unicode no matter what locale is in effect.</p> <p>Under Unicode rules, there are a few case-insensitive matches that cross the 255/256 boundary. Except for UTF-8 locales in Perls v5.20 and later, these are disallowed under <code>/l</code>. For example, 0xFF (on ASCII platforms) does not caselessly match the character at 0x178, <code>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS</code>, because 0xFF may not be <code>LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS</code> in the current locale, and Perl has no way of knowing if that character even exists in the locale, much less what code point it is.</p> <p>In a UTF-8 locale in v5.20 and later, the only visible difference between locale and non-locale in regular expressions should be tainting, if your perl supports taint checking (see <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>).</p> <p>This modifier may be specified to be the default by <code>use locale</code>, but see <a href="#Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect%3F">"Which character set modifier is in effect?"</a>. </p> <h5 id="/u">
/u</h5> <p>means to use Unicode rules when pattern matching. On ASCII platforms, this means that the code points between 128 and 255 take on their Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) meanings (which are the same as Unicode's). (Otherwise Perl considers their meanings to be undefined.) Thus, under this modifier, the ASCII platform effectively becomes a Unicode platform; and hence, for example, <code>\w</code> will match any of the more than 100_000 word characters in Unicode.</p> <p>Unlike most locales, which are specific to a language and country pair, Unicode classifies all the characters that are letters <i>somewhere</i> in the world as <code>\w</code>. For example, your locale might not think that <code>LATIN SMALL LETTER ETH</code> is a letter (unless you happen to speak Icelandic), but Unicode does. Similarly, all the characters that are decimal digits somewhere in the world will match <code>\d</code>; this is hundreds, not 10, possible matches. And some of those digits look like some of the 10 ASCII digits, but mean a different number, so a human could easily think a number is a different quantity than it really is. For example, <code>BENGALI DIGIT FOUR</code> (U+09EA) looks very much like an <code>ASCII DIGIT EIGHT</code> (U+0038), and <code>LEPCHA DIGIT SIX</code> (U+1C46) looks very much like an <code>ASCII DIGIT FIVE</code> (U+0035). And, <code>\d+</code>, may match strings of digits that are a mixture from different writing systems, creating a security issue. A fraudulent website, for example, could display the price of something using U+1C46, and it would appear to the user that something cost 500 units, but it really costs 600. A browser that enforced script runs (<a href="#Script-Runs">"Script Runs"</a>) would prevent that fraudulent display. <a href="Unicode::UCD.html#num%28%29">"num()" in Unicode::UCD</a> can also be used to sort this out. Or the <code>/a</code> modifier can be used to force <code>\d</code> to match just the ASCII 0 through 9.</p> <p>Also, under this modifier, case-insensitive matching works on the full set of Unicode characters. The <code>KELVIN SIGN</code>, for example matches the letters "k" and "K"; and <code>LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF</code> matches the sequence "ff", which, if you're not prepared, might make it look like a hexadecimal constant, presenting another potential security issue. See <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr36">https://unicode.org/reports/tr36</a> for a detailed discussion of Unicode security issues.</p> <p>This modifier may be specified to be the default by <code>use feature 'unicode_strings</code>, <code>use locale ':not_characters'</code>, or <code><a href="perlfunc.html#use-VERSION">use v5.12</a></code> (or higher), but see <a href="#Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect%3F">"Which character set modifier is in effect?"</a>. </p> <h5 id="/d">
/d</h5> <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Because of the unpredictable behaviors this modifier causes, only use it to maintain weird backward compatibilities. Use the <a href="feature.html#The-%27unicode_strings%27-feature"><code>unicode_strings</code></a> feature in new code to avoid inadvertently enabling this modifier by default.</p> <p>What does this modifier do? It "Depends"!</p> <p>This modifier means to use platform-native matching rules except when there is cause to use Unicode rules instead, as follows:</p> <ol> <li>
<p>the target string's <a href="perlunifaq.html#What-is-%22the-UTF8-flag%22%3F">UTF8 flag</a> (see below) is set; or</p> </li> <li>
<p>the pattern's <a href="perlunifaq.html#What-is-%22the-UTF8-flag%22%3F">UTF8 flag</a> (see below) is set; or</p> </li> <li>
<p>the pattern explicitly mentions a code point that is above 255 (say by <code>\x{100}</code>); or</p> </li> <li>
<p>the pattern uses a Unicode name (<code>\N{...}</code>); or</p> </li> <li>
<p>the pattern uses a Unicode property (<code>\p{...}</code> or <code>\P{...}</code>); or</p> </li> <li>
<p>the pattern uses a Unicode break (<code>\b{...}</code> or <code>\B{...}</code>); or</p> </li> <li>
<p>the pattern uses <code><a href="#%28%3F%5B-%5D%29">"(?[ ])"</a></code></p> </li> <li>
<p>the pattern uses <a href="#Script-Runs"><code>(*script_run: ...)</code></a></p> </li> </ol> <p>Regarding the "UTF8 flag" references above: normally Perl applications shouldn't think about that flag. It's part of Perl's internals, so it can change whenever Perl wants. <code>/d</code> may thus cause unpredictable results. See <a href="perlunicode.html#The-%22Unicode-Bug%22">"The "Unicode Bug"" in perlunicode</a>. This bug has become rather infamous, leading to yet other (without swearing) names for this modifier like "Dicey" and "Dodgy".</p> <p>Here are some examples of how that works on an ASCII platform:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$str =  "\xDF";        #
utf8::downgrade($str); # $str is not UTF8-flagged.
$str =~ /^\w/;         # No match, since no UTF8 flag.

$str .= "\x{0e0b}";    # Now $str is UTF8-flagged.
$str =~ /^\w/;         # Match! $str is now UTF8-flagged.
chop $str;
$str =~ /^\w/;         # Still a match! $str retains its UTF8 flag.</code></pre> <p>Under Perl's default configuration this modifier is automatically selected by default when none of the others are, so yet another name for it (unfortunately) is "Default".</p> <p>Whenever you can, use the <a href="feature.html#The-%27unicode_strings%27-feature"><code>unicode_strings</code></a> to cause to be the default instead.</p> <h5 id="/a-(and-/aa)">
/a (and /aa)</h5> <p>This modifier stands for ASCII-restrict (or ASCII-safe). This modifier may be doubled-up to increase its effect.</p> <p>When it appears singly, it causes the sequences <code>\d</code>, <code>\s</code>, <code>\w</code>, and the Posix character classes to match only in the ASCII range. They thus revert to their pre-5.6, pre-Unicode meanings. Under <code>/a</code>, <code>\d</code> always means precisely the digits <code>"0"</code> to <code>"9"</code>; <code>\s</code> means the five characters <code>[ \f\n\r\t]</code>, and starting in Perl v5.18, the vertical tab; <code>\w</code> means the 63 characters <code>[A-Za-z0-9_]</code>; and likewise, all the Posix classes such as <code>[[:print:]]</code> match only the appropriate ASCII-range characters.</p> <p>This modifier is useful for people who only incidentally use Unicode, and who do not wish to be burdened with its complexities and security concerns.</p> <p>With <code>/a</code>, one can write <code>\d</code> with confidence that it will only match ASCII characters, and should the need arise to match beyond ASCII, you can instead use <code>\p{Digit}</code> (or <code>\p{Word}</code> for <code>\w</code>). There are similar <code>\p{...}</code> constructs that can match beyond ASCII both white space (see <a href="perlrecharclass.html#Whitespace">"Whitespace" in perlrecharclass</a>), and Posix classes (see <a href="perlrecharclass.html#POSIX-Character-Classes">"POSIX Character Classes" in perlrecharclass</a>). Thus, this modifier doesn't mean you can't use Unicode, it means that to get Unicode matching you must explicitly use a construct (<code>\p{}</code>, <code>\P{}</code>) that signals Unicode.</p> <p>As you would expect, this modifier causes, for example, <code>\D</code> to mean the same thing as <code>[^0-9]</code>; in fact, all non-ASCII characters match <code>\D</code>, <code>\S</code>, and <code>\W</code>. <code>\b</code> still means to match at the boundary between <code>\w</code> and <code>\W</code>, using the <code>/a</code> definitions of them (similarly for <code>\B</code>).</p> <p>Otherwise, <code>/a</code> behaves like the <code>/u</code> modifier, in that case-insensitive matching uses Unicode rules; for example, "k" will match the Unicode <code>\N{KELVIN SIGN}</code> under <code>/i</code> matching, and code points in the Latin1 range, above ASCII will have Unicode rules when it comes to case-insensitive matching.</p> <p>To forbid ASCII/non-ASCII matches (like "k" with <code>\N{KELVIN SIGN}</code>), specify the <code>"a"</code> twice, for example <code>/aai</code> or <code>/aia</code>. (The first occurrence of <code>"a"</code> restricts the <code>\d</code>, <i>etc</i>., and the second occurrence adds the <code>/i</code> restrictions.) But, note that code points outside the ASCII range will use Unicode rules for <code>/i</code> matching, so the modifier doesn't really restrict things to just ASCII; it just forbids the intermixing of ASCII and non-ASCII.</p> <p>To summarize, this modifier provides protection for applications that don't wish to be exposed to all of Unicode. Specifying it twice gives added protection.</p> <p>This modifier may be specified to be the default by <code>use re '/a'</code> or <code>use re '/aa'</code>. If you do so, you may actually have occasion to use the <code>/u</code> modifier explicitly if there are a few regular expressions where you do want full Unicode rules (but even here, it's best if everything were under feature <code>"unicode_strings"</code>, along with the <code>use re '/aa'</code>). Also see <a href="#Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect%3F">"Which character set modifier is in effect?"</a>. </p> <h5 id="Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect?">
Which character set modifier is in effect?</h5> <p>Which of these modifiers is in effect at any given point in a regular expression depends on a fairly complex set of interactions. These have been designed so that in general you don't have to worry about it, but this section gives the gory details. As explained below in <a href="#Extended-Patterns">"Extended Patterns"</a> it is possible to explicitly specify modifiers that apply only to portions of a regular expression. The innermost always has priority over any outer ones, and one applying to the whole expression has priority over any of the default settings that are described in the remainder of this section.</p> <p>The <code><a href="re.html#%27%2Fflags%27-mode">use re '/foo'</a></code> pragma can be used to set default modifiers (including these) for regular expressions compiled within its scope. This pragma has precedence over the other pragmas listed below that also change the defaults.</p> <p>Otherwise, <code><a href="perllocale.html">use locale</a></code> sets the default modifier to <code>/l</code>; and <code><a href="feature.html">use feature 'unicode_strings</a></code>, or <code><a href="perlfunc.html#use-VERSION">use v5.12</a></code> (or higher) set the default to <code>/u</code> when not in the same scope as either <code><a href="perllocale.html">use locale</a></code> or <code><a href="bytes.html">use bytes</a></code>. (<code><a href="perllocale.html#Unicode-and-UTF-8">use locale ':not_characters'</a></code> also sets the default to <code>/u</code>, overriding any plain <code>use locale</code>.) Unlike the mechanisms mentioned above, these affect operations besides regular expressions pattern matching, and so give more consistent results with other operators, including using <code>\U</code>, <code>\l</code>, <i>etc</i>. in substitution replacements.</p> <p>If none of the above apply, for backwards compatibility reasons, the <code>/d</code> modifier is the one in effect by default. As this can lead to unexpected results, it is best to specify which other rule set should be used.</p> <h5 id="Character-set-modifier-behavior-prior-to-Perl-5.14">
Character set modifier behavior prior to Perl 5.14</h5> <p>Prior to 5.14, there were no explicit modifiers, but <code>/l</code> was implied for regexes compiled within the scope of <code>use locale</code>, and <code>/d</code> was implied otherwise. However, interpolating a regex into a larger regex would ignore the original compilation in favor of whatever was in effect at the time of the second compilation. There were a number of inconsistencies (bugs) with the <code>/d</code> modifier, where Unicode rules would be used when inappropriate, and vice versa. <code>\p{}</code> did not imply Unicode rules, and neither did all occurrences of <code>\N{}</code>, until 5.12.</p> <h3 id="Regular-Expressions">
Regular Expressions</h3> <h4 id="Quantifiers">Quantifiers</h4> <p>Quantifiers are used when a particular portion of a pattern needs to match a certain number (or numbers) of times. If there isn't a quantifier the number of times to match is exactly one. The following standard quantifiers are recognized: </p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">*           Match 0 or more times
+           Match 1 or more times
?           Match 1 or 0 times
{n}         Match exactly n times
{n,}        Match at least n times
{,n}        Match at most n times
{n,m}       Match at least n but not more than m times</code></pre> <p>(If a non-escaped curly bracket occurs in a context other than one of the quantifiers listed above, where it does not form part of a backslashed sequence like <code>\x{...}</code>, it is either a fatal syntax error, or treated as a regular character, generally with a deprecation warning raised. To escape it, you can precede it with a backslash (<code>"\{"</code>) or enclose it within square brackets (<code>"[{]"</code>). This change will allow for future syntax extensions (like making the lower bound of a quantifier optional), and better error checking of quantifiers).</p> <p>The <code>"*"</code> quantifier is equivalent to <code>{0,}</code>, the <code>"+"</code> quantifier to <code>{1,}</code>, and the <code>"?"</code> quantifier to <code>{0,1}</code>. <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> are limited to non-negative integral values less than a preset limit defined when perl is built. This is usually 65534 on the most common platforms. The actual limit can be seen in the error message generated by code such as this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$_ **= $_ , / {$_} / for 2 .. 42;</code></pre> <p>By default, a quantified subpattern is "greedy", that is, it will match as many times as possible (given a particular starting location) while still allowing the rest of the pattern to match. If you want it to match the minimum number of times possible, follow the quantifier with a <code>"?"</code>. Note that the meanings don't change, just the "greediness": </p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">*?        Match 0 or more times, not greedily
+?        Match 1 or more times, not greedily
??        Match 0 or 1 time, not greedily
{n}?      Match exactly n times, not greedily (redundant)
{n,}?     Match at least n times, not greedily
{,n}?     Match at most n times, not greedily
{n,m}?    Match at least n but not more than m times, not greedily</code></pre> <p>Normally when a quantified subpattern does not allow the rest of the overall pattern to match, Perl will backtrack. However, this behaviour is sometimes undesirable. Thus Perl provides the "possessive" quantifier form as well.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">*+     Match 0 or more times and give nothing back
++     Match 1 or more times and give nothing back
?+     Match 0 or 1 time and give nothing back
{n}+   Match exactly n times and give nothing back (redundant)
{n,}+  Match at least n times and give nothing back
{,n}+  Match at most n times and give nothing back
{n,m}+ Match at least n but not more than m times and give nothing back</code></pre> <p>For instance,</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">'aaaa' =~ /a++a/</code></pre> <p>will never match, as the <code>a++</code> will gobble up all the <code>"a"</code>'s in the string and won't leave any for the remaining part of the pattern. This feature can be extremely useful to give perl hints about where it shouldn't backtrack. For instance, the typical "match a double-quoted string" problem can be most efficiently performed when written as:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">/"(?:[^"\\]++|\\.)*+"/</code></pre> <p>as we know that if the final quote does not match, backtracking will not help. See the independent subexpression <code><a href="#%28%3F%3Epattern%29">"(?&gt;<i>pattern</i>)"</a></code> for more details; possessive quantifiers are just syntactic sugar for that construct. For instance the above example could also be written as follows:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">/"(?&gt;(?:(?&gt;[^"\\]+)|\\.)*)"/</code></pre> <p>Note that the possessive quantifier modifier can not be combined with the non-greedy modifier. This is because it would make no sense. Consider the follow equivalency table:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">Illegal         Legal
------------    ------
X??+            X{0}
X+?+            X{1}
X{min,max}?+    X{min}</code></pre> <h4 id="Escape-sequences">
Escape sequences</h4> <p>Because patterns are processed as double-quoted strings, the following also work:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">\t          tab                   (HT, TAB)
\n          newline               (LF, NL)

\G     Match only at pos() (e.g. at the end-of-match position
       of prior m//g)</code></pre> <p>A Unicode boundary (<code>\b{}</code>), available starting in v5.22, is a spot between two characters, or before the first character in the string, or after the final character in the string where certain criteria defined by Unicode are met. See <a href="perlrebackslash.html#%5Cb%7B%7D%2C-%5Cb%2C-%5CB%7B%7D%2C-%5CB">"\b{}, \b, \B{}, \B" in perlrebackslash</a> for details.</p> <p>A word boundary (<code>\b</code>) is a spot between two characters that has a <code>\w</code> on one side of it and a <code>\W</code> on the other side of it (in either order), counting the imaginary characters off the beginning and end of the string as matching a <code>\W</code>. (Within character classes <code>\b</code> represents backspace rather than a word boundary, just as it normally does in any double-quoted string.) The <code>\A</code> and <code>\Z</code> are just like <code>"^"</code> and <code>"$"</code>, except that they won't match multiple times when the <code>/m</code> modifier is used, while <code>"^"</code> and <code>"$"</code> will match at every internal line boundary. To match the actual end of the string and not ignore an optional trailing newline, use <code>\z</code>. </p> <p>The <code>\G</code> assertion can be used to chain global matches (using <code>m//g</code>), as described in <a href="perlop.html#Regexp-Quote-Like-Operators">"Regexp Quote-Like Operators" in perlop</a>. It is also useful when writing <code>lex</code>-like scanners, when you have several patterns that you want to match against consequent substrings of your string; see the previous reference. The actual location where <code>\G</code> will match can also be influenced by using <code>pos()</code> as an lvalue: see <a href="perlfunc.html#pos">"pos" in perlfunc</a>. Note that the rule for zero-length matches (see <a href="#Repeated-Patterns-Matching-a-Zero-length-Substring">"Repeated Patterns Matching a Zero-length Substring"</a>) is modified somewhat, in that contents to the left of <code>\G</code> are not counted when determining the length of the match. Thus the following will not match forever: </p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $string = 'ABC';
pos($string) = 1;
while ($string =~ /(.\G)/g) {
    print $1;
}</code></pre> <p>It will print 'A' and then terminate, as it considers the match to be zero-width, and thus will not match at the same position twice in a row.</p> <p>It is worth noting that <code>\G</code> improperly used can result in an infinite loop. Take care when using patterns that include <code>\G</code> in an alternation.</p> <p>Note also that <code>s///</code> will refuse to overwrite part of a substitution that has already been replaced; so for example this will stop after the first iteration, rather than iterating its way backwards through the string:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$_ = "123456789";
pos = 6;
s/.(?=.\G)/X/g;
print; 	# prints 1234X6789, not XXXXX6789</code></pre> <h4 id="Capture-groups">
Capture groups</h4> <p>The grouping construct <code>( ... )</code> creates capture groups (also referred to as capture buffers). To refer to the current contents of a group later on, within the same pattern, use <code>\g1</code> (or <code>\g{1}</code>) for the first, <code>\g2</code> (or <code>\g{2}</code>) for the second, and so on. This is called a <i>backreference</i>. There is no limit to the number of captured substrings that you may use. Groups are numbered with the leftmost open parenthesis being number 1, <i>etc</i>. If a group did not match, the associated backreference won't match either. (This can happen if the group is optional, or in a different branch of an alternation.) You can omit the <code>"g"</code>, and write <code>"\1"</code>, <i>etc</i>, but there are some issues with this form, described below.</p> <p>You can also refer to capture groups relatively, by using a negative number, so that <code>\g-1</code> and <code>\g{-1}</code> both refer to the immediately preceding capture group, and <code>\g-2</code> and <code>\g{-2}</code> both refer to the group before it. For example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">/
 (Y)            # group 1
 (              # group 2
    (X)         # group 3
    \g{-1}      # backref to group 3
    \g{-3}      # backref to group 1
 )
/x</code></pre> <p>would match the same as <code>/(Y) ( (X) \g3 \g1 )/x</code>. This allows you to interpolate regexes into larger regexes and not have to worry about the capture groups being renumbered.</p> <p>You can dispense with numbers altogether and create named capture groups. The notation is <code>(?&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;...)</code> to declare and <code>\g{<i>name</i>}</code> to reference. (To be compatible with .Net regular expressions, <code>\g{<i>name</i>}</code> may also be written as <code>\k{<i>name</i>}</code>, <code>\k&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;</code> or <code>\k'<i>name</i>'</code>.) <i>name</i> must not begin with a number, nor contain hyphens. When different groups within the same pattern have the same name, any reference to that name assumes the leftmost defined group. Named groups count in absolute and relative numbering, and so can also be referred to by those numbers. (It's possible to do things with named capture groups that would otherwise require <code>(??{})</code>.)</p> <p>Capture group contents are dynamically scoped and available to you outside the pattern until the end of the enclosing block or until the next successful match in the same scope, whichever comes first. See <a href="perlsyn.html#Compound-Statements">"Compound Statements" in perlsyn</a> and <a href="perlvar.html#Scoping-Rules-of-Regex-Variables">"Scoping Rules of Regex Variables" in perlvar</a> for more details.</p> <p>You can access the contents of a capture group by absolute number (using <code>"$1"</code> instead of <code>"\g1"</code>, <i>etc</i>); or by name via the <code>%+</code> hash, using <code>"$+{<i>name</i>}"</code>.</p> <p>Braces are required in referring to named capture groups, but are optional for absolute or relative numbered ones. Braces are safer when creating a regex by concatenating smaller strings. For example if you have <code>qr/$a$b/</code>, and <code>$a</code> contained <code>"\g1"</code>, and <code>$b</code> contained <code>"37"</code>, you would get <code>/\g137/</code> which is probably not what you intended.</p> <p>If you use braces, you may also optionally add any number of blank (space or tab) characters within but adjacent to the braces, like <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>\g{ -1 }</code></span>, or <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>\k{ <i>name</i> }</code></span>.</p> <p>The <code>\g</code> and <code>\k</code> notations were introduced in Perl 5.10.0. Prior to that there were no named nor relative numbered capture groups. Absolute numbered groups were referred to using <code>\1</code>, <code>\2</code>, <i>etc</i>., and this notation is still accepted (and likely always will be). But it leads to some ambiguities if there are more than 9 capture groups, as <code>\10</code> could mean either the tenth capture group, or the character whose ordinal in octal is 010 (a backspace in ASCII). Perl resolves this ambiguity by interpreting <code>\10</code> as a backreference only if at least 10 left parentheses have opened before it. Likewise <code>\11</code> is a backreference only if at least 11 left parentheses have opened before it. And so on. <code>\1</code> through <code>\9</code> are always interpreted as backreferences. There are several examples below that illustrate these perils. You can avoid the ambiguity by always using <code>\g{}</code> or <code>\g</code> if you mean capturing groups; and for octal constants always using <code>\o{}</code>, or for <code>\077</code> and below, using 3 digits padded with leading zeros, since a leading zero implies an octal constant.</p> <p>The <code>\<i>digit</i></code> notation also works in certain circumstances outside the pattern. See <a href="#Warning-on-%5C1-Instead-of-%241">"Warning on \1 Instead of $1"</a> below for details.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>s/^([^ ]*) *([^ ]*)/$2 $1/;     # swap first two words

(At one point <code>$0</code> did also, but now it returns the name of the program.) <code>$`</code> returns everything before the matched string. <code>$'</code> returns everything after the matched string. And <code>$^N</code> contains whatever was matched by the most-recently closed group (submatch). <code>$^N</code> can be used in extended patterns (see below), for example to assign a submatch to a variable. </p> <p>These special variables, like the <code>%+</code> hash and the numbered match variables (<code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, <code>$3</code>, <i>etc</i>.) are dynamically scoped until the end of the enclosing block or until the next successful match, whichever comes first. (See <a href="perlsyn.html#Compound-Statements">"Compound Statements" in perlsyn</a>.) </p> <p>The <code>@{^CAPTURE}</code> array may be used to access ALL of the capture buffers as an array without needing to know how many there are. For instance</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$string=~/$pattern/ and @captured = @{^CAPTURE};</code></pre> <p>will place a copy of each capture variable, <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code> etc, into the <code>@captured</code> array.</p> <p>Be aware that when interpolating a subscript of the <code>@{^CAPTURE}</code> array you must use demarcated curly brace notation:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "@{^CAPTURE[0]}";</code></pre> <p>See <a href="perldata.html#Demarcated-variable-names-using-braces">"Demarcated variable names using braces" in perldata</a> for more on this notation.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>: Failed matches in Perl do not reset the match variables, which makes it easier to write code that tests for a series of more specific cases and remembers the best match.</p> <p><b>WARNING</b>: If your code is to run on Perl 5.16 or earlier, beware that once Perl sees that you need one of <code>$&amp;</code>, <code>$`</code>, or <code>$'</code> anywhere in the program, it has to provide them for every pattern match. This may substantially slow your program.</p> <p>Perl uses the same mechanism to produce <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, <i>etc</i>, so you also pay a price for each pattern that contains capturing parentheses. (To avoid this cost while retaining the grouping behaviour, use the extended regular expression <code>(?: ... )</code> instead.) But if you never use <code>$&amp;</code>, <code>$`</code> or <code>$'</code>, then patterns <i>without</i> capturing parentheses will not be penalized. So avoid <code>$&amp;</code>, <code>$'</code>, and <code>$`</code> if you can, but if you can't (and some algorithms really appreciate them), once you've used them once, use them at will, because you've already paid the price. </p> <p>Perl 5.16 introduced a slightly more efficient mechanism that notes separately whether each of <code>$`</code>, <code>$&amp;</code>, and <code>$'</code> have been seen, and thus may only need to copy part of the string. Perl 5.20 introduced a much more efficient copy-on-write mechanism which eliminates any slowdown.</p> <p>As another workaround for this problem, Perl 5.10.0 introduced <code>${^PREMATCH}</code>, <code>${^MATCH}</code> and <code>${^POSTMATCH}</code>, which are equivalent to <code>$`</code>, <code>$&amp;</code> and <code>$'</code>, <b>except</b> that they are only guaranteed to be defined after a successful match that was executed with the <code>/p</code> (preserve) modifier. The use of these variables incurs no global performance penalty, unlike their punctuation character equivalents, however at the trade-off that you have to tell perl when you want to use them. As of Perl 5.20, these three variables are equivalent to <code>$`</code>, <code>$&amp;</code> and <code>$'</code>, and <code>/p</code> is ignored. </p> <h3 id="Quoting-metacharacters">
Quoting metacharacters</h3> <p>Backslashed metacharacters in Perl are alphanumeric, such as <code>\b</code>, <code>\w</code>, <code>\n</code>. Unlike some other regular expression languages, there are no backslashed symbols that aren't alphanumeric. So anything that looks like <code>\\</code>, <code>\(</code>, <code>\)</code>, <code>\[</code>, <code>\]</code>, <code>\{</code>, or <code>\}</code> is always interpreted as a literal character, not a metacharacter. This was once used in a common idiom to disable or quote the special meanings of regular expression metacharacters in a string that you want to use for a pattern. Simply quote all non-"word" characters:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$pattern =~ s/(\W)/\\$1/g;</code></pre> <p>(If <code>use locale</code> is set, then this depends on the current locale.) Today it is more common to use the <code><a href="perlfunc.html#quotemeta">quotemeta()</a></code> function or the <code>\Q</code> metaquoting escape sequence to disable all metacharacters' special meanings like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>/$unquoted\Q$quoted\E$unquoted/</code></pre> <p>Beware that if you put literal backslashes (those not inside interpolated variables) between <code>\Q</code> and <code>\E</code>, double-quotish backslash interpolation may lead to confusing results. If you <i>need</i> to use literal backslashes within <code>\Q...\E</code>, consult <a href="perlop.html#Gory-details-of-parsing-quoted-constructs">"Gory details of parsing quoted constructs" in perlop</a>.</p> <p><code>quotemeta()</code> and <code>\Q</code> are fully described in <a href="perlfunc.html#quotemeta">"quotemeta" in perlfunc</a>.</p> <h3 id="Extended-Patterns">
Extended Patterns</h3> <p>Perl also defines a consistent extension syntax for features not found in standard tools like <b>awk</b> and <b>lex</b>. The syntax for most of these is a pair of parentheses with a question mark as the first thing within the parentheses. The character after the question mark indicates the extension.</p> <p>A question mark was chosen for this and for the minimal-matching construct because 1) question marks are rare in older regular expressions, and 2) whenever you see one, you should stop and "question" exactly what is going on. That's psychology....</p> <dl> <dt id="(?#text)">
<code>(?#<i>text</i>)</code> </dt> <dd> <p>A comment. The <i>text</i> is ignored. Note that Perl closes the comment as soon as it sees a <code>")"</code>, so there is no way to put a literal <code>")"</code> in the comment. The pattern's closing delimiter must be escaped by a backslash if it appears in the comment.</p> <p>See <a href="#%2Fx">"/x"</a> for another way to have comments in patterns.</p> <p>Note that a comment can go just about anywhere, except in the middle of an escape sequence. Examples:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">qr/foo(?#comment)bar/'  # Matches 'foobar'

# The pattern below matches 'abcd', 'abccd', or 'abcccd'
qr/abc(?#comment between literal and its quantifier){1,3}d/

# The pattern below generates a syntax error, because the '\p' must
# be followed immediately by a '{'.
qr/\p(?#comment between \p and its property name){Any}/

# The pattern below generates a syntax error, because the initial
# '\(' is a literal opening parenthesis, and so there is nothing
# for the  closing ')' to match
qr/\(?#the backslash means this isn't a comment)p{Any}/

In other words, a pattern such as <code>((?i)(?&amp;<i>NAME</i>))</code> does not change the case-sensitivity of the <i>NAME</i> pattern.</p> <p>A modifier is overridden by later occurrences of this construct in the same scope containing the same modifier, so that</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">/((?im)foo(?-m)bar)/</code></pre> <p>matches all of <code>foobar</code> case insensitively, but uses <code>/m</code> rules for only the <code>foo</code> portion. The <code>"a"</code> flag overrides <code>aa</code> as well; likewise <code>aa</code> overrides <code>"a"</code>. The same goes for <code>"x"</code> and <code>xx</code>. Hence, in</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">/(?-x)foo/xx</code></pre> <p>both <code>/x</code> and <code>/xx</code> are turned off during matching <code>foo</code>. And in</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">/(?x)foo/x</code></pre> <p><code>/x</code> but NOT <code>/xx</code> is turned on for matching <code>foo</code>.

It doesn't work that way.) Similarly, doing something like <code>(?xx-x)foo</code> turns off all <code>"x"</code> behavior for matching <code>foo</code>, it is not that you subtract 1 <code>"x"</code> from 2 to get 1 <code>"x"</code> remaining.</p> <p>Any of these modifiers can be set to apply globally to all regular expressions compiled within the scope of a <code>use re</code>.

But a minus sign is not legal with it.</p> <p>Note that the <code>"a"</code>, <code>"d"</code>, <code>"l"</code>, <code>"p"</code>, and <code>"u"</code> modifiers are special in that they can only be enabled, not disabled, and the <code>"a"</code>, <code>"d"</code>, <code>"l"</code>, and <code>"u"</code> modifiers are mutually exclusive: specifying one de-specifies the others, and a maximum of one (or two <code>"a"</code>'s) may appear in the construct. Thus, for example, <code>(?-p)</code> will warn when compiled under <code>use warnings</code>; <code>(?-d:...)</code> and <code>(?dl:...)</code> are fatal errors.</p> <p>Note also that the <code>"p"</code> modifier is special in that its presence anywhere in a pattern has a global effect.</p> <p>Having zero modifiers makes this a no-op (so why did you specify it, unless it's generated code), and starting in v5.30, warns under <a href="re.html#%27strict%27-mode"><code>use re 'strict'</code></a>.</p> </dd> <dt id="(?:pattern)">

<code>(*atomic:<i>pattern</i>)</code> </dt> <dd> <p>An "independent" subexpression, one which matches the substring that a standalone <i>pattern</i> would match if anchored at the given position, and it matches <i>nothing other than this substring</i>. This construct is useful for optimizations of what would otherwise be "eternal" matches, because it will not backtrack (see <a href="#Backtracking">"Backtracking"</a>). It may also be useful in places where the "grab all you can, and do not give anything back" semantic is desirable.</p> <p>For example: <code>^(?&gt;a*)ab</code> will never match, since <code>(?&gt;a*)</code> (anchored at the beginning of string, as above) will match <i>all</i> characters <code>"a"</code> at the beginning of string, leaving no <code>"a"</code> for <code>ab</code> to match. In contrast, <code>a*ab</code> will match the same as <code>a+b</code>, since the match of the subgroup <code>a*</code> is influenced by the following group <code>ab</code> (see <a href="#Backtracking">"Backtracking"</a>). In particular, <code>a*</code> inside <code>a*ab</code> will match fewer characters than a standalone <code>a*</code>, since this makes the tail match.</p> <p><code>(?&gt;<i>pattern</i>)</code> does not disable backtracking altogether once it has matched. It is still possible to backtrack past the construct, but not into it. So <code>((?&gt;a*)|(?&gt;b*))ar</code> will still match "bar".</p> <p>An effect similar to <code>(?&gt;<i>pattern</i>)</code> may be achieved by writing <code>(?=(<i>pattern</i>))\g{-1}</code>. This matches the same substring as a standalone <code>a+</code>, and the following <code>\g{-1}</code> eats the matched string; it therefore makes a zero-length assertion into an analogue of <code>(?&gt;...)</code>. (The difference between these two constructs is that the second one uses a capturing group, thus shifting ordinals of backreferences in the rest of a regular expression.)</p> <p>Consider this pattern:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">m{ \(
      (
        [^()]+           # x+
      |
        \( [^()]* \)
      )+
   \)
 }x</code></pre> <p>That will efficiently match a nonempty group with matching parentheses two levels deep or less. However, if there is no such group, it will take virtually forever on a long string. That's because there are so many different ways to split a long string into several substrings. This is what <code>(.+)+</code> is doing, and <code>(.+)+</code> is similar to a subpattern of the above pattern. Consider how the pattern above detects no-match on <code>((()aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</code> in several seconds, but that each extra letter doubles this time. This exponential performance will make it appear that your program has hung. However, a tiny change to this pattern</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">m{ \(
      (
        (?&gt; [^()]+ )        # change x+ above to (?&gt; x+ )
      |
        \( [^()]* \)
      )+
   \)
 }x</code></pre> <p>which uses <code>(?&gt;...)</code> matches exactly when the one above does (verifying this yourself would be a productive exercise), but finishes in a fourth the time when used on a similar string with 1000000 <code>"a"</code>s. Be aware, however, that, when this construct is followed by a quantifier, it currently triggers a warning message under the <code>use warnings</code> pragma or <b>-w</b> switch saying it <code>"matches null string many times in regex"</code>.</p> <p>On simple groups, such as the pattern <code>(?&gt; [^()]+ )</code>, a comparable effect may be achieved by negative lookahead, as in <code>[^()]+ (?! [^()] )</code>. This was only 4 times slower on a string with 1000000 <code>"a"</code>s.</p> <p>The "grab all you can, and do not give anything back" semantic is desirable in many situations where on the first sight a simple <code>()*</code> looks like the correct solution. Suppose we parse text with comments being delimited by <code>"#"</code> followed by some optional (horizontal) whitespace. Contrary to its appearance, <code>#[ \t]*</code> <i>is not</i> the correct subexpression to match the comment delimiter, because it may "give up" some whitespace if the remainder of the pattern can be made to match that way. The correct answer is either one of these:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">(?&gt;#[ \t]*)
#[ \t]*(?![ \t])</code></pre> <p>For example, to grab non-empty comments into <code>$1</code>, one should use either one of these:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>/ (?&gt; \# [ \t]* ) (        .+ ) /x;
/     \# [ \t]*   ( [^ \t] .* ) /x;</code></pre> <p>Which one you pick depends on which of these expressions better reflects the above specification of comments.</p> <p>In some literature this construct is called "atomic matching" or "possessive matching".</p> <p>Possessive quantifiers are equivalent to putting the item they are applied to inside of one of these constructs.

For a more rigorous (and complicated) view of the rules involved in selecting a match among possible alternatives, see <a href="#Combining-RE-Pieces">"Combining RE Pieces"</a>.</p> <p>A fundamental feature of regular expression matching involves the notion called <i>backtracking</i>, which is currently used (when needed) by all regular non-possessive expression quantifiers, namely <code>"*"</code>, <code>*?</code>, <code>"+"</code>, <code>+?</code>, <code>{n,m}</code>, and <code>{n,m}?</code>. Backtracking is often optimized internally, but the general principle outlined here is valid.</p> <p>For a regular expression to match, the <i>entire</i> regular expression must match, not just part of it. So if the beginning of a pattern containing a quantifier succeeds in a way that causes later parts in the pattern to fail, the matching engine backs up and recalculates the beginning part--that's why it's called backtracking.</p> <p>Here is an example of backtracking: Let's say you want to find the word following "foo" in the string "Food is on the foo table.":</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$_ = "Food is on the foo table.";
if ( /\b(foo)\s+(\w+)/i ) {
    print "$2 follows $1.\n";
}</code></pre> <p>When the match runs, the first part of the regular expression (<code>\b(foo)</code>) finds a possible match right at the beginning of the string, and loads up <code>$1</code> with "Foo". However, as soon as the matching engine sees that there's no whitespace following the "Foo" that it had saved in <code>$1</code>, it realizes its mistake and starts over again one character after where it had the tentative match. This time it goes all the way until the next occurrence of "foo". The complete regular expression matches this time, and you get the expected output of "table follows foo."</p> <p>Sometimes minimal matching can help a lot. Imagine you'd like to match everything between "foo" and "bar". Initially, you write something like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$_ =  "The food is under the bar in the barn.";
if ( /foo(.*)bar/ ) {
    print "got &lt;$1&gt;\n";
}</code></pre> <p>Which perhaps unexpectedly yields:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">got &lt;d is under the bar in the &gt;</code></pre> <p>That's because <code>.*</code> was greedy, so you get everything between the <i>first</i> "foo" and the <i>last</i> "bar". Here it's more effective to use minimal matching to make sure you get the text between a "foo" and the first "bar" thereafter.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>  if ( /foo(.*?)bar/ ) { print "got &lt;$1&gt;\n" }
got &lt;d is under the &gt;</code></pre> <p>Here's another example. Let's say you'd like to match a number at the end of a string, and you also want to keep the preceding part of the match. So you write this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$_ = "I have 2 numbers: 53147";
if ( /(.*)(\d*)/ ) {                                # Wrong!
    print "Beginning is &lt;$1&gt;, number is &lt;$2&gt;.\n";
}</code></pre> <p>That won't work at all, because <code>.*</code> was greedy and gobbled up the whole string. As <code>\d*</code> can match on an empty string the complete regular expression matched successfully.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">Beginning is &lt;I have 2 numbers: 53147&gt;, number is &lt;&gt;.</code></pre> <p>Here are some variants, most of which don't work:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$_ = "I have 2 numbers: 53147";
@pats = qw{
    (.*)(\d*)
    (.*)(\d+)
    (.*?)(\d*)
    (.*?)(\d+)
    (.*)(\d+)$
    (.*?)(\d+)$
    (.*)\b(\d+)$
    (.*\D)(\d+)$
};

for $pat (@pats) {
    printf "%-12s ", $pat;
    if ( /$pat/ ) {
        print "&lt;$1&gt; &lt;$2&gt;\n";
    } else {
        print "FAIL\n";
    }
}</code></pre> <p>That will print out:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">(.*)(\d*)    &lt;I have 2 numbers: 53147&gt; &lt;&gt;
(.*)(\d+)    &lt;I have 2 numbers: 5314&gt; &lt;7&gt;
(.*?)(\d*)   &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;
(.*?)(\d+)   &lt;I have &gt; &lt;2&gt;
(.*)(\d+)$   &lt;I have 2 numbers: 5314&gt; &lt;7&gt;
(.*?)(\d+)$  &lt;I have 2 numbers: &gt; &lt;53147&gt;
(.*)\b(\d+)$ &lt;I have 2 numbers: &gt; &lt;53147&gt;
(.*\D)(\d+)$ &lt;I have 2 numbers: &gt; &lt;53147&gt;</code></pre> <p>As you see, this can be a bit tricky. It's important to realize that a regular expression is merely a set of assertions that gives a definition of success. There may be 0, 1, or several different ways that the definition might succeed against a particular string. And if there are multiple ways it might succeed, you need to understand backtracking to know which variety of success you will achieve.</p> <p>When using lookahead assertions and negations, this can all get even trickier. Imagine you'd like to find a sequence of non-digits not followed by "123". You might try to write that as</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$_ = "ABC123";
if ( /^\D*(?!123)/ ) {                # Wrong!
    print "Yup, no 123 in $_\n";
}</code></pre> <p>But that isn't going to match; at least, not the way you're hoping. It claims that there is no 123 in the string. Here's a clearer picture of why that pattern matches, contrary to popular expectations:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$x = 'ABC123';
$y = 'ABC445';

print "1: got $1\n" if $x =~ /^(ABC)(?!123)/;
print "2: got $1\n" if $y =~ /^(ABC)(?!123)/;

print "3: got $1\n" if $x =~ /^(\D*)(?!123)/;
print "4: got $1\n" if $y =~ /^(\D*)(?!123)/;</code></pre> <p>This prints</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">2: got ABC
3: got AB
4: got ABC</code></pre> <p>You might have expected test 3 to fail because it seems to a more general purpose version of test 1. The important difference between them is that test 3 contains a quantifier (<code>\D*</code>) and so can use backtracking, whereas test 1 will not. What's happening is that you've asked "Is it true that at the start of <code>$x</code>, following 0 or more non-digits, you have something that's not 123?" If the pattern matcher had let <code>\D*</code> expand to "ABC", this would have caused the whole pattern to fail.</p> <p>The search engine will initially match <code>\D*</code> with "ABC". Then it will try to match <code>(?!123)</code> with "123", which fails. But because a quantifier (<code>\D*</code>) has been used in the regular expression, the search engine can backtrack and retry the match differently in the hope of matching the complete regular expression.</p> <p>The pattern really, <i>really</i> wants to succeed, so it uses the standard pattern back-off-and-retry and lets <code>\D*</code> expand to just "AB" this time. Now there's indeed something following "AB" that is not "123". It's "C123", which suffices.</p> <p>We can deal with this by using both an assertion and a negation. We'll say that the first part in <code>$1</code> must be followed both by a digit and by something that's not "123". Remember that the lookaheads are zero-width expressions--they only look, but don't consume any of the string in their match. So rewriting this way produces what you'd expect; that is, case 5 will fail, but case 6 succeeds:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "5: got $1\n" if $x =~ /^(\D*)(?=\d)(?!123)/;
print "6: got $1\n" if $y =~ /^(\D*)(?=\d)(?!123)/;

6: got ABC</code></pre> <p>In other words, the two zero-width assertions next to each other work as though they're ANDed together, just as you'd use any built-in assertions: <code>/^$/</code> matches only if you're at the beginning of the line AND the end of the line simultaneously. The deeper underlying truth is that juxtaposition in regular expressions always means AND, except when you write an explicit OR using the vertical bar. <code>/ab/</code> means match "a" AND (then) match "b", although the attempted matches are made at different positions because "a" is not a zero-width assertion, but a one-width assertion.</p> <p><b>WARNING</b>: Particularly complicated regular expressions can take exponential time to solve because of the immense number of possible ways they can use backtracking to try for a match. For example, without internal optimizations done by the regular expression engine, this will take a painfully long time to run:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">'aaaaaaaaaaaa' =~ /((a{0,5}){0,5})*[c]/</code></pre> <p>And if you used <code>"*"</code>'s in the internal groups instead of limiting them to 0 through 5 matches, then it would take forever--or until you ran out of stack space. Moreover, these internal optimizations are not always applicable. For example, if you put <code>{0,5}</code> instead of <code>"*"</code> on the external group, no current optimization is applicable, and the match takes a long time to finish.</p> <p>A powerful tool for optimizing such beasts is what is known as an "independent group", which does not backtrack (see <code><a href="#%28%3F%3Epattern%29">"(?&gt;pattern)"</a></code>). Note also that zero-length lookahead/lookbehind assertions will not backtrack to make the tail match, since they are in "logical" context: only whether they match is considered relevant. For an example where side-effects of lookahead <i>might</i> have influenced the following match, see <code><a href="#%28%3F%3Epattern%29">"(?&gt;pattern)"</a></code>.</p> <h3 id="Script-Runs">
Script Runs </h3> <p>A script run is basically a sequence of characters, all from the same Unicode script (see <a href="perlunicode.html#Scripts">"Scripts" in perlunicode</a>), such as Latin or Greek. In most places a single word would never be written in multiple scripts, unless it is a spoofing attack. An infamous example, is</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">paypal.com</code></pre> <p>Those letters could all be Latin (as in the example just above), or they could be all Cyrillic (except for the dot), or they could be a mixture of the two. In the case of an internet address the <code>.com</code> would be in Latin, And any Cyrillic ones would cause it to be a mixture, not a script run. Someone clicking on such a link would not be directed to the real Paypal website, but an attacker would craft a look-alike one to attempt to gather sensitive information from the person.</p> <p>Starting in Perl 5.28, it is now easy to detect strings that aren't script runs. Simply enclose just about any pattern like either of these:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">(*script_run:pattern)
(*sr:pattern)</code></pre> <p>What happens is that after <i>pattern</i> succeeds in matching, it is subjected to the additional criterion that every character in it must be from the same script (see exceptions below). If this isn't true, backtracking occurs until something all in the same script is found that matches, or all possibilities are exhausted. This can cause a lot of backtracking, but generally, only malicious input will result in this, though the slow down could cause a denial of service attack. If your needs permit, it is best to make the pattern atomic to cut down on the amount of backtracking. This is so likely to be what you want, that instead of writing this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">(*script_run:(?&gt;pattern))</code></pre> <p>you can write either of these:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">(*atomic_script_run:pattern)
(*asr:pattern)</code></pre> <p>(See <code><a href="#%28%3F%3Epattern%29">"(?&gt;<i>pattern</i>)"</a></code>.)</p> <p>In Taiwan, Japan, and Korea, it is common for text to have a mixture of characters from their native scripts and base Chinese. Perl follows Unicode's UTS 39 (<a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr39/">https://unicode.org/reports/tr39/</a>) Unicode Security Mechanisms in allowing such mixtures. For example, the Japanese scripts Katakana and Hiragana are commonly mixed together in practice, along with some Chinese characters, and hence are treated as being in a single script run by Perl.</p> <p>The rules used for matching decimal digits are slightly stricter. Many scripts have their own sets of digits equivalent to the Western <code>0</code> through <code>9</code> ones. A few, such as Arabic, have more than one set. For a string to be considered a script run, all digits in it must come from the same set of ten, as determined by the first digit encountered. As an example,</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">qr/(*script_run: \d+ \b )/x</code></pre> <p>guarantees that the digits matched will all be from the same set of 10. You won't get a look-alike digit from a different script that has a different value than what it appears to be.</p> <p>Unicode has three pseudo scripts that are handled specially.</p> <p>"Unknown" is applied to code points whose meaning has yet to be determined. Perl currently will match as a script run, any single character string consisting of one of these code points. But any string longer than one code point containing one of these will not be considered a script run.</p> <p>"Inherited" is applied to characters that modify another, such as an accent of some type. These are considered to be in the script of the master character, and so never cause a script run to not match.</p> <p>The other one is "Common". This consists of mostly punctuation, emoji, characters used in mathematics and music, the ASCII digits <code>0</code> through <code>9</code>, and full-width forms of these digits. These characters can appear intermixed in text in many of the world's scripts. These also don't cause a script run to not match. But like other scripts, all digits in a run must come from the same set of 10.</p> <p>This construct is non-capturing. You can add parentheses to <i>pattern</i> to capture, if desired. You will have to do this if you plan to use <a href="#%28%2AACCEPT%29-%28%2AACCEPT%3Aarg%29">"(*ACCEPT) (*ACCEPT:arg)"</a> and not have it bypass the script run checking.</p> <p>The <code>Script_Extensions</code> property as modified by UTS 39 (<a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr39/">https://unicode.org/reports/tr39/</a>) is used as the basis for this feature.</p> <p>To summarize,</p> <ul> <li>
<p>All length 0 or length 1 sequences are script runs.</p> </li> <li>
<p>A longer sequence is a script run if and only if <b>all</b> of the following conditions are met:</p>  <ol> <li>
<p>No code point in the sequence has the <code>Script_Extension</code> property of <code>Unknown</code>.</p> <p>This currently means that all code points in the sequence have been assigned by Unicode to be characters that aren't private use nor surrogate code points.</p> </li> <li>
<p>All characters in the sequence come from the Common script and/or the Inherited script and/or a single other script.</p> <p>The script of a character is determined by the <code>Script_Extensions</code> property as modified by UTS 39 (<a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr39/">https://unicode.org/reports/tr39/</a>), as described above.</p> </li> <li>

Repeated Patterns Matching a Zero-length Substring</h3> <p><b>WARNING</b>: Difficult material (and prose) ahead. This section needs a rewrite.</p> <p>Regular expressions provide a terse and powerful programming language. As with most other power tools, power comes together with the ability to wreak havoc.</p> <p>A common abuse of this power stems from the ability to make infinite loops using regular expressions, with something as innocuous as:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>'foo' =~ m{ ( o? )* }x;</code></pre> <p>The <code>o?</code> matches at the beginning of "<code>foo</code>", and since the position in the string is not moved by the match, <code>o?</code> would match again and again because of the <code>"*"</code> quantifier. Another common way to create a similar cycle is with the looping modifier <code>/g</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@matches = ( 'foo' =~ m{ o? }xg );</code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "match: &lt;$&amp;&gt;\n" while 'foo' =~ m{ o? }xg;</code></pre> <p>or the loop implied by <code>split()</code>.</p> <p>However, long experience has shown that many programming tasks may be significantly simplified by using repeated subexpressions that may match zero-length substrings. Here's a simple example being:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@chars = split //, $string;           # // is not magic in split
($whitewashed = $string) =~ s/()/ /g; # parens avoid magic s// /</code></pre> <p>Thus Perl allows such constructs, by <i>forcefully breaking the infinite loop</i>. The rules for this are different for lower-level loops given by the greedy quantifiers <code>*+{}</code>, and for higher-level ones like the <code>/g</code> modifier or <code>split()</code> operator.</p> <p>The lower-level loops are <i>interrupted</i> (that is, the loop is broken) when Perl detects that a repeated expression matched a zero-length substring. Thus</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>m{ (?: NON_ZERO_LENGTH | ZERO_LENGTH )* }x;</code></pre> <p>is made equivalent to</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>m{ (?: NON_ZERO_LENGTH )* (?: ZERO_LENGTH )? }x;</code></pre> <p>For example, this program</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!perl -l
"aaaaab" =~ /
  (?:
     a                 # non-zero
     |                 # or
    (?{print "hello"}) # print hello whenever this
                       #    branch is tried
    (?=(b))            # zero-width assertion
  )*  # any number of times
 /x;
print $&amp;;
print $1;</code></pre> <p>prints</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">hello
aaaaa
b</code></pre> <p>Notice that "hello" is only printed once, as when Perl sees that the sixth iteration of the outermost <code>(?:)*</code> matches a zero-length string, it stops the <code>"*"</code>.</p> <p>The higher-level loops preserve an additional state between iterations: whether the last match was zero-length. To break the loop, the following match after a zero-length match is prohibited to have a length of zero. This prohibition interacts with backtracking (see <a href="#Backtracking">"Backtracking"</a>), and so the <i>second best</i> match is chosen if the <i>best</i> match is of zero length.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$_ = 'bar';
s/\w??/&lt;$&amp;&gt;/g;</code></pre> <p>results in <code>&lt;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;r&gt;&lt;&gt;</code>. At each position of the string the best match given by non-greedy <code>??</code> is the zero-length match, and the <i>second best</i> match is what is matched by <code>\w</code>. Thus zero-length matches alternate with one-character-long matches.</p> <p>Similarly, for repeated <code>m/()/g</code> the second-best match is the match at the position one notch further in the string.</p> <p>The additional state of being <i>matched with zero-length</i> is associated with the matched string, and is reset by each assignment to <code>pos()</code>. Zero-length matches at the end of the previous match are ignored during <code>split</code>.</p> <h3 id="Combining-RE-Pieces">
Combining RE Pieces</h3> <p>Each of the elementary pieces of regular expressions which were described before (such as <code>ab</code> or <code>\Z</code>) could match at most one substring at the given position of the input string. However, in a typical regular expression these elementary pieces are combined into more complicated patterns using combining operators <code>ST</code>, <code>S|T</code>, <code>S*</code> <i>etc</i>. (in these examples <code>"S"</code> and <code>"T"</code> are regular subexpressions).</p> <p>Such combinations can include alternatives, leading to a problem of choice: if we match a regular expression <code>a|ab</code> against <code>"abc"</code>, will it match substring <code>"a"</code> or <code>"ab"</code>? One way to describe which substring is actually matched is the concept of backtracking (see <a href="#Backtracking">"Backtracking"</a>). However, this description is too low-level and makes you think in terms of a particular implementation.</p> <p>Another description starts with notions of "better"/"worse". All the substrings which may be matched by the given regular expression can be sorted from the "best" match to the "worst" match, and it is the "best" match which is chosen. This substitutes the question of "what is chosen?" by the question of "which matches are better, and which are worse?".</p> <p>Again, for elementary pieces there is no such question, since at most one match at a given position is possible. This section describes the notion of better/worse for combining operators.

Creating Custom RE Engines</h3> <p>As of Perl 5.10.0, one can create custom regular expression engines. This is not for the faint of heart, as they have to plug in at the C level. See <a href="perlreapi.html">perlreapi</a> for more details.</p> <p>As an alternative, overloaded constants (see <a href="overload.html">overload</a>) provide a simple way to extend the functionality of the RE engine, by substituting one pattern for another.</p> <p>Suppose that we want to enable a new RE escape-sequence <code>\Y|</code> which matches at a boundary between whitespace characters and non-whitespace characters. Note that <code>(?=\S)(?&lt;!\S)|(?!\S)(?&lt;=\S)</code> matches exactly at these positions, so we want to have each <code>\Y|</code> in the place of the more complicated version. We can create a module <code>customre</code> to do this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>package customre;
use overload;

sub import {
  shift;
  die "No argument to customre::import allowed" if @_;
  overload::constant 'qr' =&gt; \&amp;convert;
}

sub invalid { die "/$_[0]/: invalid escape '\\$_[1]'"}

# We must also take care of not escaping the legitimate \\Y|
# sequence, hence the presence of '\\' in the conversion rules.
my %rules = ( '\\' =&gt; '\\\\',
              'Y|' =&gt; qr/(?=\S)(?&lt;!\S)|(?!\S)(?&lt;=\S)/ );
sub convert {
  my $re = shift;
  $re =~ s{
            \\ ( \\ | Y . )
          }
          { $rules{$1} or invalid($re,$1) }sgex;
  return $re;
}</code></pre> <p>Now <code>use customre</code> enables the new escape in constant regular expressions, <i>i.e.</i>, those without any runtime variable interpolations. As documented in <a href="overload.html">overload</a>, this conversion will work only over literal parts of regular expressions. For <code>\Y|$re\Y|</code> the variable part of this regular expression needs to be converted explicitly (but only if the special meaning of <code>\Y|</code> should be enabled inside <code>$re</code>):</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use customre;
$re = &lt;&gt;;
chomp $re;
$re = customre::convert $re;
/\Y|$re\Y|/;</code></pre> <h3 id="Embedded-Code-Execution-Frequency">
Embedded Code Execution Frequency</h3> <p>The exact rules for how often <code>(?{})</code> and <code>(??{})</code> are executed in a pattern are unspecified, and this is even more true of <code>(*{})</code>. In the case of a successful match you can assume that they DWIM and will be executed in left to right order the appropriate number of times in the accepting path of the pattern as would any other meta-pattern. How non- accepting pathways and match failures affect the number of times a pattern is executed is specifically unspecified and may vary depending on what optimizations can be applied to the pattern and is likely to change from version to version.</p> <p>For instance in</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>"aaabcdeeeee"=~/a(?{print "a"})b(?{print "b"})cde/;</code></pre> <p>the exact number of times "a" or "b" are printed out is unspecified for failure, but you may assume they will be printed at least once during a successful match, additionally you may assume that if "b" is printed, it will be preceded by at least one "a".</p> <p>In the case of branching constructs like the following:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>/a(b|(?{ print "a" }))c(?{ print "c" })/;</code></pre> <p>you can assume that the input "ac" will output "ac", and that "abc" will output only "c".</p> <p>When embedded code is quantified, successful matches will call the code once for each matched iteration of the quantifier. For example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>"good" =~ /g(?:o(?{print "o"}))*d/;</code></pre> <p>will output "o" twice.</p> <p>For historical and consistency reasons the use of normal code blocks anywhere in a pattern will disable certain optimisations. As of 5.37.7 you can use an "optimistic" codeblock, <code>(*{ ... })</code> as a replacement for <code>(?{ ... })</code>, if you do *not* wish to disable these optimisations. This may result in the code block being called less often than it might have been had they not been optimistic.</p> <h3 id="PCRE/Python-Support">
