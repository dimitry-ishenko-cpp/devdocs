The Syntax of Variable Names</h3> <p>Variable names in Perl can have several formats. Usually, they must begin with a letter or underscore, in which case they can be arbitrarily long (up to an internal limit of 251 characters) and may contain letters, digits, underscores, or the special sequence <code>::</code> or <code>'</code>. In this case, the part before the last <code>::</code> or <code>'</code> is taken to be a <i>package qualifier</i>; see <a href="perlmod.html">perlmod</a>. A Unicode letter that is not ASCII is not considered to be a letter unless <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>"use utf8"</code></span> is in effect, and somewhat more complicated rules apply; see <a href="perldata.html#Identifier-parsing">"Identifier parsing" in perldata</a> for details.</p> <p>Perl variable names may also be a sequence of digits, a single punctuation character, or the two-character sequence: <code>^</code> (caret or CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT) followed by any one of the characters <code>[][A-Z^_?\]</code>. These names are all reserved for special uses by Perl; for example, the all-digits names are used to hold data captured by backreferences after a regular expression match.</p> <p>Since Perl v5.6.0, Perl variable names may also be alphanumeric strings preceded by a caret. These must all be written using the demarcated variable form using curly braces such as <code>${^Foo}</code>; the braces are <b>not</b> optional. <code>${^Foo}</code> denotes the scalar variable whose name is considered to be a control-<code>F</code> followed by two <code>o</code>'s. (See <a href="perldata.html#Demarcated-variable-names-using-braces">"Demarcated variable names using braces" in perldata</a> for more information on this form of spelling a variable name or specifying access to an element of an array or a hash). These variables are reserved for future special uses by Perl, except for the ones that begin with <code>^_</code> (caret-underscore). No name that begins with <code>^_</code> will acquire a special meaning in any future version of Perl; such names may therefore be used safely in programs. <code>$^_</code> itself, however, <i>is</i> reserved.</p> <p>Note that you also <b>must</b> use the demarcated form to access subscripts of variables of this type when interpolating, for instance to access the first element of the <code>@{^CAPTURE}</code> variable inside of a double quoted string you would write <code>"${^CAPTURE[0]}"</code> and NOT <code>"${^CAPTURE}[0]"</code> which would mean to reference a scalar variable named <code>${^CAPTURE}</code> and not index 0 of the magic <code>@{^CAPTURE}</code> array which is populated by the regex engine.</p> <p>Perl identifiers that begin with digits or punctuation characters are exempt from the effects of the <code>package</code> declaration and are always forced to be in package <code>main</code>; they are also exempt from <code>strict 'vars'</code> errors. A few other names are also exempt in these ways:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">ENV      STDIN
INC      STDOUT
ARGV     STDERR
ARGVOUT
SIG</code></pre> <p>In particular, the special <code>${^_XYZ}</code> variables are always taken to be in package <code>main</code>, regardless of any <code>package</code> declarations presently in scope.</p> <h2 id="SPECIAL-VARIABLES">
SPECIAL VARIABLES</h2> <p>The following names have special meaning to Perl. Most punctuation names have reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in the shells. Nevertheless, if you wish to use long variable names, you need only say:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use English;</code></pre> <p>at the top of your program. This aliases all the short names to the long names in the current package. Some even have medium names, generally borrowed from <b>awk</b>. For more info, please see <a href="english.html">English</a>.</p> <p>Before you continue, note the sort order for variables. In general, we first list the variables in case-insensitive, almost-lexigraphical order (ignoring the <code>{</code> or <code>^</code> preceding words, as in <code>${^UNICODE}</code> or <code>$^T</code>), although <code>$_</code> and <code>@_</code> move up to the top of the pile. For variables with the same identifier, we list it in order of scalar, array, hash, and bareword.</p> <h3 id="General-Variables">
General Variables</h3> <dl> <dt id="$ARG" class="variable">

$_ </dt> <dd> <p>The default input and pattern-searching space. The following pairs are equivalent:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>while (&lt;&gt;) {...}    # equivalent only in while!

chomp
chomp($_)</code></pre> <p>Here are the places where Perl will assume <code>$_</code> even if you don't use it:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>The following functions use <code>$_</code> as a default argument:</p> <p>abs, alarm, chomp, chop, chr, chroot, cos, defined, eval, evalbytes, exp, fc, glob, hex, int, lc, lcfirst, length, log, lstat, mkdir, oct, ord, pos, print, printf, quotemeta, readlink, readpipe, ref, require, reverse (in scalar context only), rmdir, say, sin, split (for its second argument), sqrt, stat, study, uc, ucfirst, unlink, unpack.</p> </li> <li>
<p>All file tests (<code>-f</code>, <code>-d</code>) except for <code>-t</code>, which defaults to STDIN. See <a href="perlfunc.html#-X">"-X" in perlfunc</a></p> </li> <li>
<p>The pattern matching operations <code>m//</code>, <code>s///</code> and <code>tr///</code> (aka <code>y///</code>) when used without an <code>=~</code> operator.</p> </li> <li>
<p>The default iterator variable in a <code>foreach</code> loop if no other variable is supplied.</p> </li> <li>
<p>The implicit iterator variable in the <code>grep()</code> and <code>map()</code> functions.</p> </li> <li>
<p>The implicit variable of <code>given()</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>The default place to put the next value or input record when a <code>&lt;FH&gt;</code>, <code>readline</code>, <code>readdir</code> or <code>each</code> operation's result is tested by itself as the sole criterion of a <code>while</code> test. Outside a <code>while</code> test, this will not happen.</p> </li> </ul> <p><code>$_</code> is a global variable.</p> <p>However, between perl v5.10.0 and v5.24.0, it could be used lexically by writing <code>my $_</code>. Making <code>$_</code> refer to the global <code>$_</code> in the same scope was then possible with <code>our $_</code>. This experimental feature was removed and is now a fatal error, but you may encounter it in older code.</p> <p>Mnemonic: underline is understood in certain operations.</p> </dd> <dt id="@ARG" class="variable">

$" </dt> <dd> <p>When an array or an array slice is interpolated into a double-quoted string or a similar context such as <code>/.../</code>, its elements are separated by this value. Default is a space. For example, this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "The array is: @array\n";</code></pre> <p>is equivalent to this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "The array is: " . join($", @array) .

Though you <i>can</i> set this variable, doing so is generally discouraged, although it can be invaluable for some testing purposes. It will be reset automatically across <code>fork()</code> calls.</p> <p>Note for Linux and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl v5.16.0 perl would emulate POSIX semantics on Linux systems using LinuxThreads, a partial implementation of POSIX Threads that has since been superseded by the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL).</p> <p>LinuxThreads is now obsolete on Linux, and caching <code>getpid()</code> like this made embedding perl unnecessarily complex (since you'd have to manually update the value of $$), so now <code>$$</code> and <code>getppid()</code> will always return the same values as the underlying C library.</p> <p>Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems also used LinuxThreads up until and including the 6.0 release, but after that moved to FreeBSD thread semantics, which are POSIX-like.</p> <p>To see if your system is affected by this discrepancy check if <code>getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep -q NPTL</code> returns a false value. NTPL threads preserve the POSIX semantics.</p> <p>Mnemonic: same as shells.</p> </dd> <dt id="$PROGRAM_NAME" class="variable">
$PROGRAM_NAME</dt>  <dt id="$0" class="variable">
$0 </dt> <dd> <p>Contains the name of the program being executed.</p> <p>On some (but not all) operating systems assigning to <code>$0</code> modifies the argument area that the <code>ps</code> program sees. On some platforms you may have to use special <code>ps</code> options or a different <code>ps</code> to see the changes. Modifying the <code>$0</code> is more useful as a way of indicating the current program state than it is for hiding the program you're running.</p> <p>Note that there are platform-specific limitations on the maximum length of <code>$0</code>. In the most extreme case it may be limited to the space occupied by the original <code>$0</code>.</p> <p>In some platforms there may be arbitrary amount of padding, for example space characters, after the modified name as shown by <code>ps</code>. In some platforms this padding may extend all the way to the original length of the argument area, no matter what you do (this is the case for example with Linux 2.2).</p> <p>Note for BSD users: setting <code>$0</code> does not completely remove "perl" from the ps(1) output. For example, setting <code>$0</code> to <code>"foobar"</code> may result in <code>"perl: foobar (perl)"</code> (whether both the <code>"perl: "</code> prefix and the " (perl)" suffix are shown depends on your exact BSD variant and version). This is an operating system feature, Perl cannot help it.</p> <p>In multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so that any thread may modify its copy of the <code>$0</code> and the change becomes visible to ps(1) (assuming the operating system plays along). Note that the view of <code>$0</code> the other threads have will not change since they have their own copies of it.</p> <p>If the program has been given to perl via the switches <code>-e</code> or <code>-E</code>, <code>$0</code> will contain the string <code>"-e"</code>.</p> <p>On Linux as of perl v5.14.0 the legacy process name will be set with <code>prctl(2)</code>, in addition to altering the POSIX name via <code>argv[0]</code> as perl has done since version 4.000. Now system utilities that read the legacy process name such as ps, top and killall will recognize the name you set when assigning to <code>$0</code>. The string you supply will be cut off at 16 bytes, this is a limitation imposed by Linux.</p> <p>Wide characters are invalid in <code>$0</code> values. For historical reasons, though, Perl accepts them and encodes them to UTF-8. When this happens a wide-character warning is triggered.</p> <p>Mnemonic: same as <b>sh</b> and <b>ksh</b>.</p> </dd> <dt id="$REAL_GROUP_ID" class="variable">

Needless to say code like this is unusual, it is unlikely you will actually need to raise the setting. However it may be useful to set it to 0 for a limited time period to prevent BEGIN{} blocks from being executed during an <code>eval EXPR</code>.</p> <p>Note that setting this to 1 would NOT affect code like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>BEGIN { $n += 1; BEGIN { $n += 2; BEGIN { $n += 4 } } }</code></pre> <p>The reason is that BEGIN blocks are executed immediately after they are completed, thus the innermost will execute before the ones which contain it have even finished compiling, and the depth will not go above 1.

This means you get reliable signal handling.</p> <p>The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl v5.8.0 from immediate (also known as "unsafe") to deferred, also known as "safe signals". See <a href="perlipc.html">perlipc</a> for more information.</p> <p>Certain internal hooks can be also set using the <code>%SIG</code> hash. The routine indicated by <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code> is called when a warning message is about to be printed. The warning message is passed as the first argument. The presence of a <code>__WARN__</code> hook causes the ordinary printing of warnings to <code>STDERR</code> to be suppressed. You can use this to save warnings in a variable, or turn warnings into fatal errors, like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] };
eval $proggie;</code></pre> <p>As the <code>'IGNORE'</code> hook is not supported by <code>__WARN__</code>, its effect is the same as using <code>'DEFAULT'</code>. You can disable warnings using the empty subroutine:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {};</code></pre> <p>The routine indicated by <code>$SIG{__DIE__}</code> is called when a fatal exception is about to be thrown. The error message is passed as the first argument. When a <code>__DIE__</code> hook routine returns, the exception processing continues as it would have in the absence of the hook, unless the hook routine itself exits via a <code>goto &amp;sub</code>, a loop exit, or a <code>die()</code>. The <code>__DIE__</code> handler is explicitly disabled during the call, so that you can die from a <code>__DIE__</code> handler. Similarly for <code>__WARN__</code>.</p> <p>The <code>$SIG{__DIE__}</code> hook is called even inside an <code>eval()</code>. It was never intended to happen this way, but an implementation glitch made this possible. This used to be deprecated, as it allowed strange action at a distance like rewriting a pending exception in <code>$@</code>. Plans to rectify this have been scrapped, as users found that rewriting a pending exception is actually a useful feature, and not a bug.</p> <p>The <code>$SIG{__DIE__}</code> doesn't support <code>'IGNORE'</code>; it has the same effect as <code>'DEFAULT'</code>.</p> <p><code>__DIE__</code>/<code>__WARN__</code> handlers are very special in one respect: they may be called to report (probable) errors found by the parser. In such a case the parser may be in inconsistent state, so any attempt to evaluate Perl code from such a handler will probably result in a segfault. This means that warnings or errors that result from parsing Perl should be used with extreme caution, like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>require Carp if defined $^S;
Carp::confess("Something wrong") if defined &amp;Carp::confess;
die "Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give "
  . "backtrace...\n\t"
  . "To see backtrace try starting Perl with -MCarp switch";</code></pre> <p>Here the first line will load <code>Carp</code> <i>unless</i> it is the parser who called the handler. The second line will print backtrace and die if <code>Carp</code> was available. The third line will be executed only if <code>Carp</code> was not available.</p> <p>Having to even think about the <code>$^S</code> variable in your exception handlers is simply wrong. <code>$SIG{__DIE__}</code> as currently implemented invites grievous and difficult to track down errors. Avoid it and use an <code>END{}</code> or CORE::GLOBAL::die override instead.</p> <p>See <a href="perlfunc.html#die">"die" in perlfunc</a>, <a href="perlfunc.html#warn">"warn" in perlfunc</a>, <a href="perlfunc.html#eval">"eval" in perlfunc</a>, and <a href="warnings.html">warnings</a> for additional information.</p> </dd> <dt id="%{^HOOK}" class="variable">

Variables related to regular expressions</h3> <p>Most of the special variables related to regular expressions are side effects. Perl sets these variables when it has completed a match successfully, so you should check the match result before using them. For instance:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>if( /P(A)TT(ER)N/ ) {
    print "I found $1 and $2\n";
}</code></pre> <p>These variables are read-only and behave similarly to a dynamically scoped variable, with only a few exceptions which are explicitly documented as behaving otherwise. See the following section for more details.</p> <h4 id="Scoping-Rules-of-Regex-Variables">
Scoping Rules of Regex Variables</h4> <p>Regular expression variables allow the programmer to access the state of the most recent <i>successful</i> regex match in the current dynamic scope.</p> <p>The variables themselves are global and unscoped, but the data they access is scoped similarly to dynamically scoped variables, in that every successful match behaves as though it localizes a global state object to the current block or file scope. (See <a href="perlsyn.html#Compound-Statements">"Compound Statements" in perlsyn</a> for more details on dynamic scoping and the <code>local</code> keyword.)</p> <p>A <i>successful match</i> includes any successful match performed by the search and replace operator <code>s///</code> as well as those performed by the <code>m//</code> operator.</p> <p>Consider the following code:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @state;
sub matchit {
    push @state, $1;            # pushes "baz"
    my $str = shift;
    $str =~ /(zat)/;            # matches "zat"
    push @state, $1;            # pushes "zat"
}

{
    $str = "foo bar baz blorp zat";
    $str =~ /(foo)/;            # matches "foo"
    push @state, $1;            # pushes "foo"
    {
        $str =~ /(pizza)/;      # does NOT match
        push @state, $1;        # pushes "foo"
        $str =~ /(bar)/;        # matches "bar"
        push @state, $1;        # pushes "bar"
        $str =~ /(baz)/;        # matches "baz"
        matchit($str);          # see above
        push @state, $1;        # pushes "baz"
    }
    $str =~ s/noodles/rice/;    # does NOT match
    push @state, $1;            # pushes "foo"
    $str =~ s/(blorp)/zwoop/;   # matches "blorp"
    push @state, $1;            # pushes "blorp"
}
# the following prints "foo, foo, bar, baz, zat, baz, foo, blorp"
print join ",", @state;</code></pre> <p>Notice that each successful match in the exact same scope overrides the match context of the previous successful match, but that unsuccessful matches do not. Also note that in an inner nested scope the previous state from an outer dynamic scope persists until it has been overriden by another successful match, but that when the inner nested scope exits whatever match context was in effect before the inner successful match is restored when the scope concludes.</p> <p>It is a known issue that <code>goto LABEL</code> may interact poorly with the dynamically scoped match context. This may not be fixable, and is considered to be one of many good reasons to avoid <code>goto LABEL</code>.</p> <h4 id="Performance-issues">
Performance issues</h4> <p>Traditionally in Perl, any use of any of the three variables <code>$`</code>, <code>$&amp;</code> or <code>$'</code> (or their <code>use English</code> equivalents) anywhere in the code, caused all subsequent successful pattern matches to make a copy of the matched string, in case the code might subsequently access one of those variables. This imposed a considerable performance penalty across the whole program, so generally the use of these variables has been discouraged.</p> <p>In Perl 5.6.0 the <code>@-</code> and <code>@+</code> dynamic arrays were introduced that supply the indices of successful matches. So you could for example do this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$str =~ /pattern/;

print $`, $&amp;, $'; # bad: performance hit

print             # good: no performance hit
substr($str, 0,     $-[0]),
substr($str, $-[0], $+[0]-$-[0]),
substr($str, $+[0]);</code></pre> <p>In Perl 5.10.0 the <code>/p</code> match operator flag and the <code>${^PREMATCH}</code>, <code>${^MATCH}</code>, and <code>${^POSTMATCH}</code> variables were introduced, that allowed you to suffer the penalties only on patterns marked with <code>/p</code>.</p> <p>In Perl 5.18.0 onwards, perl started noting the presence of each of the three variables separately, and only copied that part of the string required; so in</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">$`; $&amp;; "abcdefgh" =~ /d/</code></pre> <p>perl would only copy the "abcd" part of the string. That could make a big difference in something like</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$str = 'x' x 1_000_000;
$&amp;; # whoops
$str =~ /x/g # one char copied a million times, not a million chars</code></pre> <p>In Perl 5.20.0 a new copy-on-write system was enabled by default, which finally fixes most of the performance issues with these three variables, and makes them safe to use anywhere.</p> <p>The <code>Devel::NYTProf</code> and <code>Devel::FindAmpersand</code> modules can help you find uses of these problematic match variables in your code.</p> <dl> <dt id="$digits&gt;-($1,-$2,-...)" class="variable">

Variables related to filehandles</h3> <p>Variables that depend on the currently selected filehandle may be set by calling an appropriate object method on the <code>IO::Handle</code> object, although this is less efficient than using the regular built-in variables. (Summary lines below for this contain the word HANDLE.) First you must say</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use IO::Handle;</code></pre> <p>after which you may use either</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">method HANDLE EXPR</code></pre> <p>or more safely,</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>HANDLE-&gt;method(EXPR)</code></pre> <p>Each method returns the old value of the <code>IO::Handle</code> attribute. The methods each take an optional EXPR, which, if supplied, specifies the new value for the <code>IO::Handle</code> attribute in question. If not supplied, most methods do nothing to the current value--except for <code>autoflush()</code>, which will assume a 1 for you, just to be different.</p> <p>Because loading in the <code>IO::Handle</code> class is an expensive operation, you should learn how to use the regular built-in variables.</p> <p>A few of these variables are considered "read-only". This means that if you try to assign to this variable, either directly or indirectly through a reference, you'll raise a run-time exception.</p> <p>You should be very careful when modifying the default values of most special variables described in this document. In most cases you want to localize these variables before changing them, since if you don't, the change may affect other modules which rely on the default values of the special variables that you have changed. This is one of the correct ways to read the whole file at once:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open my $fh, "&lt;", "foo" or die $!;
local $/; # enable localized slurp mode
my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
close $fh;</code></pre> <p>But the following code is quite bad:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open my $fh, "&lt;", "foo" or die $!;
undef $/; # enable slurp mode
my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
close $fh;</code></pre> <p>since some other module, may want to read data from some file in the default "line mode", so if the code we have just presented has been executed, the global value of <code>$/</code> is now changed for any other code running inside the same Perl interpreter.</p> <p>Usually when a variable is localized you want to make sure that this change affects the shortest scope possible. So unless you are already inside some short <code>{}</code> block, you should create one yourself. For example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $content = '';
open my $fh, "&lt;", "foo" or die $!;
{
    local $/;
    $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
}
close $fh;</code></pre> <p>Here is an example of how your own code can go broken:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>for ( 1..3 ){
    $\ = "\r\n";
    nasty_break();
    print "$_";
}

sub nasty_break {
    $\ = "\f";
    # do something with $_
}</code></pre> <p>You probably expect this code to print the equivalent of</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">"1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n"</code></pre> <p>but instead you get:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">"1\f2\f3\f"</code></pre> <p>Why? Because <code>nasty_break()</code> modifies <code>$\</code> without localizing it first. The value you set in <code>nasty_break()</code> is still there when you return. The fix is to add <code>local()</code> so the value doesn't leak out of <code>nasty_break()</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>local $\ = "\f";</code></pre> <p>It's easy to notice the problem in such a short example, but in more complicated code you are looking for trouble if you don't localize changes to the special variables.</p> <dl> <dt id="$ARGV" class="variable">

You may set it to a multi-character string to match a multi-character terminator, or to <code>undef</code> to read through the end of file. Setting it to <code>"\n\n"</code> means something slightly different than setting to <code>""</code>, if the file contains consecutive empty lines. Setting to <code>""</code> will treat two or more consecutive empty lines as a single empty line. Setting to <code>"\n\n"</code> will blindly assume that the next input character belongs to the next paragraph, even if it's a newline.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>local $/;           # enable "slurp" mode

s/\n[ \t]+/ /g;</code></pre> <p>Remember: the value of <code>$/</code> is a string, not a regex. <b>awk</b> has to be better for something. :-)</p> <p>Setting <code>$/</code> to an empty string -- the so-called <i>paragraph mode</i> -- merits special attention. When <code>$/</code> is set to <code>""</code> and the entire file is read in with that setting, any sequence of one or more consecutive newlines at the beginning of the file is discarded. With the exception of the final record in the file, each sequence of characters ending in two or more newlines is treated as one record and is read in to end in exactly two newlines. If the last record in the file ends in zero or one consecutive newlines, that record is read in with that number of newlines. If the last record ends in two or more consecutive newlines, it is read in with two newlines like all preceding records.</p> <p>Suppose we wrote the following string to a file:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $string = "\n\n\n";
$string .= "alpha beta\ngamma delta\n\n\n";
$string .= "epsilon zeta eta\n\n";
$string .= "theta\n";

my $file = 'simple_file.txt';
open my $OUT, '&gt;', $file or die;
print $OUT $string;
close $OUT or die;</code></pre> <p>Now we read that file in paragraph mode:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>local $/ = ""; # paragraph mode
open my $IN, '&lt;', $file or die;
my @records = &lt;$IN&gt;;
close $IN or die;</code></pre> <p><code>@records</code> will consist of these 3 strings:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">(
  "alpha beta\ngamma delta\n\n",
  "epsilon zeta eta\n\n",
  "theta\n",
)</code></pre> <p>Setting <code>$/</code> to a reference to an integer, scalar containing an integer, or scalar that's convertible to an integer will attempt to read records instead of lines, with the maximum record size being the referenced integer number of characters. So this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>local $/ = \32768; # or \"32768", or \$var_containing_32768
open my $fh, "&lt;", $myfile or die $!;
local $_ = &lt;$fh&gt;;</code></pre> <p>will read a record of no more than 32768 characters from $fh. If you're not reading from a record-oriented file (or your OS doesn't have record-oriented files), then you'll likely get a full chunk of data with every read. If a record is larger than the record size you've set, you'll get the record back in pieces. Trying to set the record size to zero or less is deprecated and will cause $/ to have the value of "undef", which will cause reading in the (rest of the) whole file.</p> <p>As of 5.19.9 setting <code>$/</code> to any other form of reference will throw a fatal exception. This is in preparation for supporting new ways to set <code>$/</code> in the future.</p> <p>On VMS only, record reads bypass PerlIO layers and any associated buffering, so you must not mix record and non-record reads on the same filehandle.

Error Variables </h3> <p>The variables <code>$@</code>, <code>$!</code>, <code>$^E</code>, and <code>$?</code> contain information about different types of error conditions that may appear during execution of a Perl program. The variables are shown ordered by the "distance" between the subsystem which reported the error and the Perl process. They correspond to errors detected by the Perl interpreter, C library, operating system, or an external program, respectively.</p> <p>To illustrate the differences between these variables, consider the following Perl expression, which uses a single-quoted string. After execution of this statement, perl may have set all four special error variables:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>eval q{
    open my $pipe, "/cdrom/install |" or die $!;
    my @res = &lt;$pipe&gt;;
    close $pipe or die "bad pipe: $?, $!";
};</code></pre> <p>When perl executes the <code>eval()</code> expression, it translates the <code>open()</code>, <code>&lt;PIPE&gt;</code>, and <code>close</code> calls in the C run-time library and thence to the operating system kernel. perl sets <code>$!</code> to the C library's <code>errno</code> if one of these calls fails.</p> <p><code>$@</code> is set if the string to be <code>eval</code>-ed did not compile (this may happen if <code>open</code> or <code>close</code> were imported with bad prototypes), or if Perl code executed during evaluation <code>die()</code>d. In these cases the value of <code>$@</code> is the compile error, or the argument to <code>die</code> (which will interpolate <code>$!</code> and <code>$?</code>). (See also <a href="fatal.html">Fatal</a>, though.)</p> <p>Under a few operating systems, <code>$^E</code> may contain a more verbose error indicator, such as in this case, "CDROM tray not closed." Systems that do not support extended error messages leave <code>$^E</code> the same as <code>$!</code>.</p> <p>Finally, <code>$?</code> may be set to a non-0 value if the external program <i>/cdrom/install</i> fails. The upper eight bits reflect specific error conditions encountered by the program (the program's <code>exit()</code> value). The lower eight bits reflect mode of failure, like signal death and core dump information. See <a href="http://man.he.net/man2/wait">wait(2)</a> for details. In contrast to <code>$!</code> and <code>$^E</code>, which are set only if an error condition is detected, the variable <code>$?</code> is set on each <code>wait</code> or pipe <code>close</code>, overwriting the old value. This is more like <code>$@</code>, which on every <code>eval()</code> is always set on failure and cleared on success.</p> <p>For more details, see the individual descriptions at <code>$@</code>, <code>$!</code>, <code>$^E</code>, and <code>$?</code>.</p> <dl> <dt id="${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}" class="variable">

Deprecated and removed variables</h3> <p>Deprecating a variable announces the intent of the perl maintainers to eventually remove the variable from the language. It may still be available despite its status. Using a deprecated variable triggers a warning.</p> <p>Once a variable is removed, its use triggers an error telling you the variable is unsupported.</p> <p>See <a href="perldiag.html">perldiag</a> for details about error messages.</p> <dl> <dt id="$hash" class="variable">
$# </dt> <dd> <p><code>$#</code> was a variable that could be used to format printed numbers. After a deprecation cycle, its magic was removed in Perl v5.10.0 and using it now triggers a warning: <code>$# is no longer supported</code>.</p> <p>This is not the sigil you use in front of an array name to get the last index, like <code>$#array</code>. That's still how you get the last index of an array in Perl. The two have nothing to do with each other.</p> <p>Deprecated in Perl 5.</p> <p>Removed in Perl v5.10.0.</p> </dd> <dt id="$*" class="variable">
$* </dt> <dd> <p><code>$*</code> was a variable that you could use to enable multiline matching. After a deprecation cycle, its magic was removed in Perl v5.10.0. Using it now triggers a warning: <code>$* is no longer supported</code>. You should use the <code>/s</code> and <code>/m</code> regexp modifiers instead.</p> <p>Deprecated in Perl 5.</p> <p>Removed in Perl v5.10.0.</p> </dd> <dt id="$[" class="variable">
$[ </dt> <dd> <p>This variable stores the index of the first element in an array, and of the first character in a substring. The default is 0, but you could theoretically set it to 1 to make Perl behave more like <b>awk</b> (or Fortran) when subscripting and when evaluating the index() and substr() functions.</p> <p>As of release 5 of Perl, assignment to <code>$[</code> is treated as a compiler directive, and cannot influence the behavior of any other file. (That's why you can only assign compile-time constants to it.) Its use is highly discouraged.</p> <p>Prior to Perl v5.10.0, assignment to <code>$[</code> could be seen from outer lexical scopes in the same file, unlike other compile-time directives (such as <a href="strict.html">strict</a>). Using local() on it would bind its value strictly to a lexical block. Now it is always lexically scoped.</p> <p>As of Perl v5.16.0, it is implemented by the <a href="arybase.html">arybase</a> module.</p> <p>As of Perl v5.30.0, or under <code>use v5.16</code>, or <code>no feature "array_base"</code>, <code>$[</code> no longer has any effect, and always contains 0. Assigning 0 to it is permitted, but any other value will produce an error.</p> <p>Mnemonic: [ begins subscripts.</p> <p>Deprecated in Perl v5.12.0.</p> </dd> <dt id="${^ENCODING}" class="variable">
${^ENCODING} </dt> <dd> <p>This variable is no longer supported.</p> <p>It used to hold the <i>object reference</i> to the <code>Encode</code> object that was used to convert the source code to Unicode.</p> <p>Its purpose was to allow your non-ASCII Perl scripts not to have to be written in UTF-8; this was useful before editors that worked on UTF-8 encoded text were common, but that was long ago. It caused problems, such as affecting the operation of other modules that weren't expecting it, causing general mayhem.</p> <p>If you need something like this functionality, it is recommended that use you a simple source filter, such as <a href="Filter::Encoding.html">Filter::Encoding</a>.</p> <p>If you are coming here because code of yours is being adversely affected by someone's use of this variable, you can usually work around it by doing this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>local ${^ENCODING};</code></pre> <p>near the beginning of the functions that are getting broken. This undefines the variable during the scope of execution of the including function.</p> <p>This variable was added in Perl 5.8.2 and removed in 5.26.0.
