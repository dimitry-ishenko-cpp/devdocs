There is both a function interface and an object-oriented interface. The File::Temp constructor or the tempfile() function can be used to return the name and the open filehandle of a temporary file. The tempdir() function can be used to create a temporary directory.</p> <p>The security aspect of temporary file creation is emphasized such that a filehandle and filename are returned together. This helps guarantee that a race condition can not occur where the temporary file is created by another process between checking for the existence of the file and its opening. Additional security levels are provided to check, for example, that the sticky bit is set on world writable directories. See <a href="#safe_level">"safe_level"</a> for more information.</p> <p>For compatibility with popular C library functions, Perl implementations of the mkstemp() family of functions are provided. These are, mkstemp(), mkstemps(), mkdtemp() and mktemp().</p> <p>Additionally, implementations of the standard <a href="posix.html">POSIX</a> tmpnam() and tmpfile() functions are provided if required.</p> <p>Implementations of mktemp(), tmpnam(), and tempnam() are provided, but should be used with caution since they return only a filename that was valid when function was called, so cannot guarantee that the file will not exist by the time the caller opens the filename.</p> <p>Filehandles returned by these functions support the seekable methods.</p> <h2 id="OBJECT-ORIENTED-INTERFACE">
OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE</h2> <p>This is the primary interface for interacting with <code>File::Temp</code>. Using the OO interface a temporary file can be created when the object is constructed and the file can be removed when the object is no longer required.</p> <p>Note that there is no method to obtain the filehandle from the <code>File::Temp</code> object. The object itself acts as a filehandle. The object isa <code>IO::Handle</code> and isa <code>IO::Seekable</code> so all those methods are available.</p> <p>Also, the object is configured such that it stringifies to the name of the temporary file and so can be compared to a filename directly. It numifies to the <code>refaddr</code> the same as other handles and so can be compared to other handles with <code>==</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$fh eq $filename       # as a string

The behaviour of the file can be changed using various options:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$fh = tempfile();
($fh, $filename) = tempfile();</code></pre> <p>Create a temporary file in the directory specified for temporary files, as specified by the tmpdir() function in <a href="File::Spec.html">File::Spec</a>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template);</code></pre> <p>Create a temporary file in the current directory using the supplied template. Trailing `X' characters are replaced with random letters to generate the filename. At least four `X' characters must be present at the end of the template.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, SUFFIX =&gt; $suffix)</code></pre> <p>Same as previously, except that a suffix is added to the template after the `X' translation. Useful for ensuring that a temporary filename has a particular extension when needed by other applications. But see the WARNING at the end.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, DIR =&gt; $dir);</code></pre> <p>Translates the template as before except that a directory name is specified.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, TMPDIR =&gt; 1);</code></pre> <p>Equivalent to specifying a DIR of "File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir", writing the file into the same temporary directory as would be used if no template was specified at all.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, UNLINK =&gt; 1);</code></pre> <p>Return the filename and filehandle as before except that the file is automatically removed when the program exits (dependent on $KEEP_ALL). Default is for the file to be removed if a file handle is requested and to be kept if the filename is requested. In a scalar context (where no filename is returned) the file is always deleted either (depending on the operating system) on exit or when it is closed (unless $KEEP_ALL is true when the temp file is created).</p> <p>Use the object-oriented interface if fine-grained control of when a file is removed is required.</p> <p>If the template is not specified, a template is always automatically generated. This temporary file is placed in tmpdir() (<a href="File::Spec.html">File::Spec</a>) unless a directory is specified explicitly with the DIR option.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$fh = tempfile( DIR =&gt; $dir );</code></pre> <p>If called in scalar context, only the filehandle is returned and the file will automatically be deleted when closed on operating systems that support this (see the description of tmpfile() elsewhere in this document). This is the preferred mode of operation, as if you only have a filehandle, you can never create a race condition by fumbling with the filename. On systems that can not unlink an open file or can not mark a file as temporary when it is opened (for example, Windows NT uses the <code>O_TEMPORARY</code> flag) the file is marked for deletion when the program ends (equivalent to setting UNLINK to 1). The <code>UNLINK</code> flag is ignored if present.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>(undef, $filename) = tempfile($template, OPEN =&gt; 0);</code></pre> <p>This will return the filename based on the template but will not open this file. Cannot be used in conjunction with UNLINK set to true. Default is to always open the file to protect from possible race conditions. A warning is issued if warnings are turned on. Consider using the tmpnam() and mktemp() functions described elsewhere in this document if opening the file is not required.</p> <p>To open the temporary filehandle with O_EXLOCK (open with exclusive file lock) use <code>EXLOCK=&gt;1</code>. This is supported only by some operating systems (most notably BSD derived systems). By default EXLOCK will be false. Former <code>File::Temp</code> versions set EXLOCK to true, so to be sure to get an unlocked filehandle also with older versions, explicitly set <code>EXLOCK=&gt;0</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, EXLOCK =&gt; 1);</code></pre> <p>By default, the temp file is created with 0600 file permissions. Use <code>PERMS</code> to change this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, PERMS =&gt; 0666);</code></pre> <p>Options can be combined as required.</p> <p>Will croak() if there is an error.</p> <p>Available since 0.05.</p> <p>UNLINK flag available since 0.10.</p> <p>TMPDIR flag available since 0.19.</p> <p>EXLOCK flag available since 0.19.</p> <p>PERMS flag available since 0.2310.</p> </dd> <dt id="tempdir"><b>tempdir</b></dt> <dd> <p>This is the recommended interface for creation of temporary directories. By default the directory will not be removed on exit (that is, it won't be temporary; this behaviour can not be changed because of issues with backwards compatibility). To enable removal either use the CLEANUP option which will trigger removal on program exit, or consider using the "newdir" method in the object interface which will allow the directory to be cleaned up when the object goes out of scope.</p> <p>The behaviour of the function depends on the arguments:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$tempdir = tempdir();</code></pre> <p>Create a directory in tmpdir() (see <a href="File::Spec.html">File::Spec</a>).</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$tempdir = tempdir( $template );</code></pre> <p>Create a directory from the supplied template. This template is similar to that described for tempfile(). `X' characters at the end of the template are replaced with random letters to construct the directory name. At least four `X' characters must be in the template.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$tempdir = tempdir ( DIR =&gt; $dir );</code></pre> <p>Specifies the directory to use for the temporary directory. The temporary directory name is derived from an internal template.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$tempdir = tempdir ( $template, DIR =&gt; $dir );</code></pre> <p>Prepend the supplied directory name to the template. The template should not include parent directory specifications itself. Any parent directory specifications are removed from the template before prepending the supplied directory.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$tempdir = tempdir ( $template, TMPDIR =&gt; 1 );</code></pre> <p>Using the supplied template, create the temporary directory in a standard location for temporary files. Equivalent to doing</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$tempdir = tempdir ( $template, DIR =&gt; File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir);</code></pre> <p>but shorter. Parent directory specifications are stripped from the template itself. The <code>TMPDIR</code> option is ignored if <code>DIR</code> is set explicitly. Additionally, <code>TMPDIR</code> is implied if neither a template nor a directory are supplied.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$tempdir = tempdir( $template, CLEANUP =&gt; 1);</code></pre> <p>Create a temporary directory using the supplied template, but attempt to remove it (and all files inside it) when the program exits. Note that an attempt will be made to remove all files from the directory even if they were not created by this module (otherwise why ask to clean it up?). The directory removal is made with the rmtree() function from the <a href="File::Path.html">File::Path</a> module. Of course, if the template is not specified, the temporary directory will be created in tmpdir() and will also be removed at program exit.</p> <p>Will croak() if there is an error.</p> <p>Current API available since 0.05.</p> </dd> </dl> <h2 id="MKTEMP-FUNCTIONS">

If the directory is writable by group or by other, it is then checked to make sure that the sticky bit is set.</p> <p>Will not work on platforms that do not support the <code>-k</code> test for sticky bit.</p> </dd> <dt id="HIGH">HIGH</dt> <dd> <p>In addition to the MEDIUM security checks, also check for the possibility of ``chown() giveaway'' using the <a href="posix.html">POSIX</a> sysconf() function. If this is a possibility, each directory in the path is checked in turn for safeness, recursively walking back to the root directory.</p> <p>For platforms that do not support the <a href="posix.html">POSIX</a> <code>_PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED</code> symbol (for example, Windows NT) it is assumed that ``chown() giveaway'' is possible and the recursive test is performed.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>The level can be changed as follows:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>File::Temp-&gt;safe_level( File::Temp::HIGH );</code></pre> <p>The level constants are not exported by the module.</p> <p>Currently, you must be running at least perl v5.6.0 in order to run with MEDIUM or HIGH security. This is simply because the safety tests use functions from <a href="fcntl.html">Fcntl</a> that are not available in older versions of perl. The problem is that the version number for Fcntl is the same in perl 5.6.0 and in 5.005_03 even though they are different versions.</p> <p>On systems that do not support the HIGH or MEDIUM safety levels (for example Win NT or OS/2) any attempt to change the level will be ignored. The decision to ignore rather than raise an exception allows portable programs to be written with high security in mind for the systems that can support this without those programs failing on systems where the extra tests are irrelevant.</p> <p>If you really need to see whether the change has been accepted simply examine the return value of <code>safe_level</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$newlevel = File::Temp-&gt;safe_level( File::Temp::HIGH );
die "Could not change to high security"
    if $newlevel != File::Temp::HIGH;</code></pre> <p>Available since 0.05.</p> </dd> <dt id="TopSystemUID">TopSystemUID</dt> <dd> <p>This is the highest UID on the current system that refers to a root UID. This is used to make sure that the temporary directory is owned by a system UID (<code>root</code>, <code>bin</code>, <code>sys</code> etc) rather than simply by root.</p> <p>This is required since on many unix systems <code>/tmp</code> is not owned by root.</p> <p>Default is to assume that any UID less than or equal to 10 is a root UID.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>File::Temp-&gt;top_system_uid(10);
my $topid = File::Temp-&gt;top_system_uid;</code></pre> <p>This value can be adjusted to reduce security checking if required. The value is only relevant when <code>safe_level</code> is set to MEDIUM or higher.</p> <p>Available since 0.05.</p> </dd> <dt id="$KEEP_ALL">
<b>$KEEP_ALL</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>Controls whether temporary files and directories should be retained regardless of any instructions in the program to remove them automatically. This is useful for debugging but should not be used in production code.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$File::Temp::KEEP_ALL = 1;</code></pre> <p>Default is for files to be removed as requested by the caller.</p> <p>In some cases, files will only be retained if this variable is true when the file is created. This means that you can not create a temporary file, set this variable and expect the temp file to still be around when the program exits.</p> </dd> <dt id="$DEBUG">
<b>$DEBUG</b>
</dt> <dd> <p>Controls whether debugging messages should be enabled.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$File::Temp::DEBUG = 1;</code></pre> <p>Default is for debugging mode to be disabled.</p> <p>Available since 0.15.</p> </dd> </dl> <h2 id="WARNING">WARNING</h2> <p>For maximum security, endeavour always to avoid ever looking at, touching, or even imputing the existence of the filename. You do not know that that filename is connected to the same file as the handle you have, and attempts to check this can only trigger more race conditions. It's far more secure to use the filehandle alone and dispense with the filename altogether.</p> <p>If you need to pass the handle to something that expects a filename then on a unix system you can use <code>"/dev/fd/" . fileno($fh)</code> for arbitrary programs. Perl code that uses the 2-argument version of <code>open</code> can be passed <code>"+&lt;=&amp;" . fileno($fh)</code>. Otherwise you will need to pass the filename. You will have to clear the close-on-exec bit on that file descriptor before passing it to another process.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Fcntl qw/F_SETFD F_GETFD/;
fcntl($tmpfh, F_SETFD, 0)
    or die "Can't clear close-on-exec flag on temp fh: $!\n";</code></pre> <h3 id="Temporary-files-and-NFS">
Temporary files and NFS</h3> <p>Some problems are associated with using temporary files that reside on NFS file systems and it is recommended that a local filesystem is used whenever possible. Some of the security tests will most probably fail when the temp file is not local. Additionally, be aware that the performance of I/O operations over NFS will not be as good as for a local disk.</p> <h3 id="Forking">Forking</h3> <p>In some cases files created by File::Temp are removed from within an END block. Since END blocks are triggered when a child process exits (unless <code>POSIX::_exit()</code> is used by the child) File::Temp takes care to only remove those temp files created by a particular process ID. This means that a child will not attempt to remove temp files created by the parent process.</p> <p>If you are forking many processes in parallel that are all creating temporary files, you may need to reset the random number seed using srand(EXPR) in each child else all the children will attempt to walk through the same set of random file names and may well cause themselves to give up if they exceed the number of retry attempts.</p> <h3 id="Directory-removal">
Directory removal</h3> <p>Note that if you have chdir'ed into the temporary directory and it is subsequently cleaned up (either in the END block or as part of object destruction), then you will get a warning from File::Path::rmtree().</p> <h3 id="Taint-mode">
Taint mode</h3> <p>If you need to run code under taint mode, updating to the latest <a href="File::Spec.html">File::Spec</a> is highly recommended. On Windows, if the directory given by <a href="File::Spec::tmpdir.html">File::Spec::tmpdir</a> isn't writable, File::Temp will attempt to fallback to the user's local application data directory or croak with an error.</p> <h3 id="BINMODE">BINMODE</h3> <p>The file returned by File::Temp will have been opened in binary mode if such a mode is available. If that is not correct, use the <code>binmode()</code> function to change the mode of the filehandle.</p> <p>Note that you can modify the encoding of a file opened by File::Temp also by using <code>binmode()</code>.</p> <h2 id="HISTORY">HISTORY</h2> <p>Originally began life in May 1999 as an XS interface to the system mkstemp() function. In March 2000, the OpenBSD mkstemp() code was translated to Perl for total control of the code's security checking, to ensure the presence of the function regardless of operating system and to help with portability. The module was shipped as a standard part of perl from v5.6.1.</p> <p>Thanks to Tom Christiansen for suggesting that this module should be written and providing ideas for code improvements and security enhancements.</p> <h2 id="SEE-ALSO">
