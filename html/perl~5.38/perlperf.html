While many perl developers have come from other languages, and can use their prior knowledge where appropriate, there are many other people who might benefit from a few perl specific pointers. If you want the condensed version, perhaps the best advice comes from the renowned Japanese Samurai, Miyamoto Musashi, who said:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">"Do Not Engage in Useless Activity"</code></pre> <p>in 1645.</p> <h2 id="OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</h2> <p>Perhaps the most common mistake programmers make is to attempt to optimize their code before a program actually does anything useful - this is a bad idea. There's no point in having an extremely fast program that doesn't work. The first job is to get a program to <i>correctly</i> do something <b>useful</b>, (not to mention ensuring the test suite is fully functional), and only then to consider optimizing it. Having decided to optimize existing working code, there are several simple but essential steps to consider which are intrinsic to any optimization process.</p> <h3 id="ONE-STEP-SIDEWAYS">
ONE STEP SIDEWAYS</h3> <p>Firstly, you need to establish a baseline time for the existing code, which timing needs to be reliable and repeatable. You'll probably want to use the <code>Benchmark</code> or <code>Devel::NYTProf</code> modules, or something similar, for this step, or perhaps the Unix system <code>time</code> utility, whichever is appropriate. See the base of this document for a longer list of benchmarking and profiling modules, and recommended further reading.</p> <h3 id="ONE-STEP-FORWARD">
ONE STEP FORWARD</h3> <p>Next, having examined the program for <i>hot spots</i>, (places where the code seems to run slowly), change the code with the intention of making it run faster. Using version control software, like <code>subversion</code>, will ensure no changes are irreversible. It's too easy to fiddle here and fiddle there - don't change too much at any one time or you might not discover which piece of code <b>really</b> was the slow bit.</p> <h3 id="ANOTHER-STEP-SIDEWAYS">
ANOTHER STEP SIDEWAYS</h3> <p>It's not enough to say: "that will make it run faster", you have to check it. Rerun the code under control of the benchmarking or profiling modules, from the first step above, and check that the new code executed the <b>same task</b> in <i>less time</i>. Save your work and repeat...</p> <h2 id="GENERAL-GUIDELINES">
GENERAL GUIDELINES</h2> <p>The critical thing when considering performance is to remember there is no such thing as a <code>Golden Bullet</code>, which is why there are no rules, only guidelines.</p> <p>It is clear that inline code is going to be faster than subroutine or method calls, because there is less overhead, but this approach has the disadvantage of being less maintainable and comes at the cost of greater memory usage - there is no such thing as a free lunch. If you are searching for an element in a list, it can be more efficient to store the data in a hash structure, and then simply look to see whether the key is defined, rather than to loop through the entire array using grep() for instance. substr() may be (a lot) faster than grep() but not as flexible, so you have another trade-off to access. Your code may contain a line which takes 0.01 of a second to execute which if you call it 1,000 times, quite likely in a program parsing even medium sized files for instance, you already have a 10 second delay, in just one single code location, and if you call that line 100,000 times, your entire program will slow down to an unbearable crawl.</p> <p>Using a subroutine as part of your sort is a powerful way to get exactly what you want, but will usually be slower than the built-in <i>alphabetic</i> <code>cmp</code> and <i>numeric</i> <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> sort operators. It is possible to make multiple passes over your data, building indices to make the upcoming sort more efficient, and to use what is known as the <code>OM</code> (Orcish Maneuver) to cache the sort keys in advance. The cache lookup, while a good idea, can itself be a source of slowdown by enforcing a double pass over the data - once to setup the cache, and once to sort the data. Using <code>pack()</code> to extract the required sort key into a consistent string can be an efficient way to build a single string to compare, instead of using multiple sort keys, which makes it possible to use the standard, written in <code>c</code> and fast, perl <code>sort()</code> function on the output, and is the basis of the <code>GRT</code> (Guttman Rossler Transform). Some string combinations can slow the <code>GRT</code> down, by just being too plain complex for its own good.</p> <p>For applications using database backends, the standard <code>DBIx</code> namespace has tries to help with keeping things nippy, not least because it tries to <i>not</i> query the database until the latest possible moment, but always read the docs which come with your choice of libraries. Among the many issues facing developers dealing with databases should remain aware of is to always use <code>SQL</code> placeholders and to consider pre-fetching data sets when this might prove advantageous. Splitting up a large file by assigning multiple processes to parsing a single file, using say <code>POE</code>, <code>threads</code> or <code>fork</code> can also be a useful way of optimizing your usage of the available <code>CPU</code> resources, though this technique is fraught with concurrency issues and demands high attention to detail.</p> <p>Every case has a specific application and one or more exceptions, and there is no replacement for running a few tests and finding out which method works best for your particular environment, this is why writing optimal code is not an exact science, and why we love using Perl so much - TMTOWTDI.</p> <h2 id="BENCHMARKS">BENCHMARKS</h2> <p>Here are a few examples to demonstrate usage of Perl's benchmarking tools.</p> <h3 id="Assigning-and-Dereferencing-Variables.">
Assigning and Dereferencing Variables.</h3> <p>I'm sure most of us have seen code which looks like, (or worse than), this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>if ( $obj-&gt;{_ref}-&gt;{_myscore} &gt;= $obj-&gt;{_ref}-&gt;{_yourscore} ) {
    ...</code></pre> <p>This sort of code can be a real eyesore to read, as well as being very sensitive to typos, and it's much clearer to dereference the variable explicitly. We're side-stepping the issue of working with object-oriented programming techniques to encapsulate variable access via methods, only accessible through an object. Here we're just discussing the technical implementation of choice, and whether this has an effect on performance. We can see whether this dereferencing operation, has any overhead by putting comparative code in a file and running a <code>Benchmark</code> test.</p> <p># dereference</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

use v5.36;

use Benchmark;

my $ref = {
        'ref'   =&gt; {
            _myscore    =&gt; '100 + 1',
            _yourscore  =&gt; '102 - 1',
        },
};

timethese(1000000, {
        'direct'       =&gt; sub {
          my $x = $ref-&gt;{ref}-&gt;{_myscore} . $ref-&gt;{ref}-&gt;{_yourscore} ;
        },
        'dereference'  =&gt; sub {
            my $ref  = $ref-&gt;{ref};
            my $myscore = $ref-&gt;{_myscore};
            my $yourscore = $ref-&gt;{_yourscore};
            my $x = $myscore . $yourscore;
        },
});</code></pre> <p>It's essential to run any timing measurements a sufficient number of times so the numbers settle on a numerical average, otherwise each run will naturally fluctuate due to variations in the environment, to reduce the effect of contention for <code>CPU</code> resources and network bandwidth for instance. Running the above code for one million iterations, we can take a look at the report output by the <code>Benchmark</code> module, to see which approach is the most effective.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">$&gt; perl dereference

Benchmark: timing 1000000 iterations of dereference, direct...
dereference:  2 wallclock secs ( 1.59 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.59 CPU) @ 628930.82/s (n=1000000)
    direct:  1 wallclock secs ( 1.20 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.20 CPU) @ 833333.33/s (n=1000000)</code></pre> <p>The difference is clear to see and the dereferencing approach is slower. While it managed to execute an average of 628,930 times a second during our test, the direct approach managed to run an additional 204,403 times, unfortunately. Unfortunately, because there are many examples of code written using the multiple layer direct variable access, and it's usually horrible. It is, however, minusculy faster. The question remains whether the minute gain is actually worth the eyestrain, or the loss of maintainability.</p> <h3 id="Search-and-replace-or-tr">
Search and replace or tr</h3> <p>If we have a string which needs to be modified, while a regex will almost always be much more flexible, <code>tr</code>, an oft underused tool, can still be a useful. One scenario might be replace all vowels with another character. The regex solution might look like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$str =~ s/[aeiou]/x/g</code></pre> <p>The <code>tr</code> alternative might look like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$str =~ tr/aeiou/xxxxx/</code></pre> <p>We can put that into a test file which we can run to check which approach is the fastest, using a global <code>$STR</code> variable to assign to the <code>my $str</code> variable so as to avoid perl trying to optimize any of the work away by noticing it's assigned only the once.</p> <p># regex-transliterate</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

use v5.36;

use Benchmark;

my $STR = "$$-this and that";

timethese( 1000000, {
'sr'  =&gt; sub { my $str = $STR; $str =~ s/[aeiou]/x/g; return $str; },
'tr'  =&gt; sub { my $str = $STR; $str =~ tr/aeiou/xxxxx/; return $str; },
});</code></pre> <p>Running the code gives us our results:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">$&gt; perl regex-transliterate

Benchmark: timing 1000000 iterations of sr, tr...
        sr:  2 wallclock secs ( 1.19 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.19 CPU) @ 840336.13/s (n=1000000)
        tr:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.49 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.49 CPU) @ 2040816.33/s (n=1000000)</code></pre> <p>The <code>tr</code> version is a clear winner. One solution is flexible, the other is fast - and it's appropriately the programmer's choice which to use.</p> <p>Check the <code>Benchmark</code> docs for further useful techniques.</p> <h2 id="PROFILING-TOOLS">
PROFILING TOOLS</h2> <p>A slightly larger piece of code will provide something on which a profiler can produce more extensive reporting statistics. This example uses the simplistic <code>wordmatch</code> program which parses a given input file and spews out a short report on the contents.</p> <p># wordmatch</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

First of all it can be used as either a <i>line</i> profiler, a <i>block</i> or a <i>subroutine</i> profiler, all at once. It can also use sub-microsecond (100ns) resolution on systems which provide <code>clock_gettime()</code>. It can be started and stopped even by the program being profiled. It's a one-line entry to profile <code>mod_perl</code> applications. It's written in <code>c</code> and is probably the fastest profiler available for Perl. The list of coolness just goes on. Enough of that, let's see how to it works - just use the familiar <code>-d</code> switch to plug it in and run the code.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">$&gt; perl -d:NYTProf wordmatch -f perl5db.pl

Many books, theses and articles, have been written about efficient sorting algorithms, and this is not the place to repeat such work, there's several good sorting modules which deserve taking a look at too: <code>Sort::Maker</code>, <code>Sort::Key</code> spring to mind. However, it's still possible to make some observations on certain Perl specific interpretations on issues relating to sorting data sets and give an example or two with regard to how sorting large data volumes can effect performance. Firstly, an often overlooked point when sorting large amounts of data, one can attempt to reduce the data set to be dealt with and in many cases <code>grep()</code> can be quite useful as a simple filter:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@data = sort grep { /$filter/ } @incoming</code></pre> <p>A command such as this can vastly reduce the volume of material to actually sort through in the first place, and should not be too lightly disregarded purely on the basis of its simplicity. The <code>KISS</code> principle is too often overlooked - the next example uses the simple system <code>time</code> utility to demonstrate. Let's take a look at an actual example of sorting the contents of a large file, an apache logfile would do. This one has over a quarter of a million lines, is 50M in size, and a snippet of it looks like this:</p> <p># logfile</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">188.209-65-87.adsl-dyn.isp.belgacom.be - - [08/Feb/2007:12:57:16 +0000] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 209 "-" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)"

If speed is in any way an issue, this approach is wrong.</p> <p>A common sight is code which looks something like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>logger-&gt;debug( "A logging message via process-id: $$ INC: "
                                                      . Dumper(\%INC) )</code></pre> <p>The problem is that this code will always be parsed and executed, even when the debug level set in the logging configuration file is zero. Once the debug() subroutine has been entered, and the internal <code>$debug</code> variable confirmed to be zero, for example, the message which has been sent in will be discarded and the program will continue. In the example given though, the <code>\%INC</code> hash will already have been dumped, and the message string constructed, all of which work could be bypassed by a debug variable at the statement level, like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>logger-&gt;debug( "A logging message via process-id: $$ INC: "
                                           . Dumper(\%INC) ) if $DEBUG;</code></pre> <p>This effect can be demonstrated by setting up a test script with both forms, including a <code>debug()</code> subroutine to emulate typical <code>logger()</code> functionality.</p> <p># ifdebug</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
