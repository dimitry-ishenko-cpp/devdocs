Perl under OS/2, DOS, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT.</p> <h2 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h2> <p>One can read this document in the following formats:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">man perlos2
view perl perlos2
explorer perlos2.html
info perlos2</code></pre> <p>to list some (not all may be available simultaneously), or it may be read <i>as is</i>: either as <i>README.os2</i>, or <i>pod/perlos2.pod</i>.</p> <p>To read the <i>.INF</i> version of documentation (<b>very</b> recommended) outside of OS/2, one needs an IBM's reader (may be available on IBM ftp sites (?) (URL anyone?)) or shipped with PC DOS 7.0 and IBM's Visual Age C++ 3.5.</p> <p>A copy of a Win* viewer is contained in the "Just add OS/2 Warp" package</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/ps/products/os2/tools/jaow/jaow.zip</code></pre> <p>in <i>?:\JUST_ADD\view.exe</i>. This gives one an access to EMX's <i>.INF</i> docs as well (text form is available in <i>/emx/doc</i> in EMX's distribution). There is also a different viewer named xview.</p> <p>Note that if you have <i>lynx.exe</i> or <i>netscape.exe</i> installed, you can follow WWW links from this document in <i>.INF</i> format. If you have EMX docs installed correctly, you can follow library links (you need to have <code>view emxbook</code> working by setting <code>EMXBOOK</code> environment variable as it is described in EMX docs).</p> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <h3 id="Target">Target</h3> <p>The target is to make OS/2 one of the best supported platform for using/building/developing Perl and <i>Perl applications</i>, as well as make Perl the best language to use under OS/2. The secondary target is to try to make this work under DOS and Win* as well (but not <b>too</b> hard).</p> <p>The current state is quite close to this target. Known limitations:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>Some *nix programs use fork() a lot; with the mostly useful flavors of perl for OS/2 (there are several built simultaneously) this is supported; but some flavors do not support this (e.g., when Perl is called from inside REXX). Using fork() after <i>use</i>ing dynamically loading extensions would not work with <i>very</i> old versions of EMX.</p> </li> <li>
<p>You need a separate perl executable <i>perl__.exe</i> (see <a href="#perl__.exe">"perl__.exe"</a>) if you want to use PM code in your application (as Perl/Tk or OpenGL Perl modules do) without having a text-mode window present.</p> <p>While using the standard <i>perl.exe</i> from a text-mode window is possible too, I have seen cases when this causes degradation of the system stability. Using <i>perl__.exe</i> avoids such a degradation.</p> </li> <li>
<p>There is no simple way to access WPS objects. The only way I know is via <code>OS2::REXX</code> and <code>SOM</code> extensions (see <a href="OS2::REXX.html">OS2::REXX</a>, <a href="som.html">SOM</a>). However, we do not have access to convenience methods of Object-REXX. (Is it possible at all? I know of no Object-REXX API.) The <code>SOM</code> extension (currently in alpha-text) may eventually remove this shortcoming; however, due to the fact that DII is not supported by the <code>SOM</code> module, using <code>SOM</code> is not as convenient as one would like it.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Please keep this list up-to-date by informing me about other items.</p> <h3 id="Other-OSes">
Other OSes</h3> <p>Since OS/2 port of perl uses a remarkable EMX environment, it can run (and build extensions, and - possibly - be built itself) under any environment which can run EMX. The current list is DOS, DOS-inside-OS/2, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT. Out of many perl flavors, only one works, see <a href="#perl_.exe">"<i>perl_.exe</i>"</a>.</p> <p>Note that not all features of Perl are available under these environments. This depends on the features the <i>extender</i> - most probably RSX - decided to implement.</p> <p>Cf. <a href="#Prerequisites">"Prerequisites"</a>.</p> <h3 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3> <dl> <dt id="EMX">EMX</dt> <dd> <p>EMX runtime is required (may be substituted by RSX). Note that it is possible to make <i>perl_.exe</i> to run under DOS without any external support by binding <i>emx.exe</i>/<i>rsx.exe</i> to it, see <a href="http://man.he.net/man1/emxbind">emxbind(1)</a>. Note that under DOS for best results one should use RSX runtime, which has much more functions working (like <code>fork</code>, <code>popen</code> and so on). In fact RSX is required if there is no VCPI present. Note the RSX requires DPMI. Many implementations of DPMI are known to be very buggy, beware!</p> <p>Only the latest runtime is supported, currently <code>0.9d fix 03</code>. Perl may run under earlier versions of EMX, but this is not tested.</p> <p>One can get different parts of EMX from, say</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">ftp://crydee.sai.msu.ru/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/emx+gcc/
http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-browse.php?dir=/pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9d/</code></pre> <p>The runtime component should have the name <i>emxrt.zip</i>.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>. When using <i>emx.exe</i>/<i>rsx.exe</i>, it is enough to have them on your path. One does not need to specify them explicitly (though this</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">emx perl_.exe -de 0</code></pre> <p>will work as well.)</p> </dd> <dt id="RSX">RSX</dt> <dd> <p>To run Perl on DPMI platforms one needs RSX runtime. This is needed under DOS-inside-OS/2, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT (see <a href="#Other-OSes">"Other OSes"</a>). RSX would not work with VCPI only, as EMX would, it requires DMPI.</p> <p>Having RSX and the latest <i>sh.exe</i> one gets a fully functional <b>*nix</b>-ish environment under DOS, say, <code>fork</code>, <code>``</code> and pipe-<code>open</code> work. In fact, MakeMaker works (for static build), so one can have Perl development environment under DOS.</p> <p>One can get RSX from, say</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">http://cd.textfiles.com/hobbesos29804/disk1/EMX09C/

This is not supported, read EMX docs to see how to do it.</p> </dd> <dt id="pdksh">pdksh</dt> <dd> <p>To start external programs with complicated command lines (like with pipes in between, and/or quoting of arguments), Perl uses an external shell. With EMX port such shell should be named <i>sh.exe</i>, and located either in the wired-in-during-compile locations (usually <i>F:/bin</i>), or in configurable location (see <a href="#PERL_SH_DIR">"<code>PERL_SH_DIR</code>"</a>).</p> <p>For best results use EMX pdksh. The standard binary (5.2.14 or later) runs under DOS (with <a href="#RSX">"RSX"</a>) as well, see</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">http://www.ilyaz.org/software/os2/</code></pre> </dd> </dl> <h3 id="Starting-Perl-programs-under-OS/2-(and-DOS-and...)">
Starting Perl programs under OS/2 (and DOS and...)</h3> <p>Start your Perl program <i>foo.pl</i> with arguments <code>arg1 arg2 arg3</code> the same way as on any other platform, by</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl foo.pl arg1 arg2 arg3</code></pre> <p>If you want to specify perl options <code>-my_opts</code> to the perl itself (as opposed to your program), use</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl -my_opts foo.pl arg1 arg2 arg3</code></pre> <p>Alternately, if you use OS/2-ish shell, like CMD or 4os2, put the following at the start of your perl script:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">extproc perl -S -my_opts</code></pre> <p>rename your program to <i>foo.cmd</i>, and start it by typing</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">foo arg1 arg2 arg3</code></pre> <p>Note that because of stupid OS/2 limitations the full path of the perl script is not available when you use <code>extproc</code>, thus you are forced to use <code>-S</code> perl switch, and your script should be on the <code>PATH</code>. As a plus side, if you know a full path to your script, you may still start it with</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl ../../blah/foo.cmd arg1 arg2 arg3</code></pre> <p>(note that the argument <code>-my_opts</code> is taken care of by the <code>extproc</code> line in your script, see <code><a href="#extproc">"extproc"</a></code> on the first line).</p> <p>To understand what the above <i>magic</i> does, read perl docs about <code>-S</code> switch - see <a href="perlrun.html">perlrun</a>, and cmdref about <code>extproc</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">view perl perlrun
man perlrun
view cmdref extproc
help extproc</code></pre> <p>or whatever method you prefer.</p> <p>There are also endless possibilities to use <i>executable extensions</i> of 4os2, <i>associations</i> of WPS and so on... However, if you use *nixish shell (like <i>sh.exe</i> supplied in the binary distribution), you need to follow the syntax specified in <a href="perlrun.html#Command-Switches">"Command Switches" in perlrun</a>.</p> <p>Note that <b>-S</b> switch supports scripts with additional extensions <i>.cmd</i>, <i>.btm</i>, <i>.bat</i>, <i>.pl</i> as well.</p> <h3 id="Starting-OS/2-(and-DOS)-programs-under-Perl">
Starting OS/2 (and DOS) programs under Perl</h3> <p>This is what system() (see <a href="perlfunc.html#system">"system" in perlfunc</a>), <code>``</code> (see <a href="perlop.html#I%2FO-Operators">"I/O Operators" in perlop</a>), and <i>open pipe</i> (see <a href="perlfunc.html#open">"open" in perlfunc</a>) are for. (Avoid exec() (see <a href="perlfunc.html#exec">"exec" in perlfunc</a>) unless you know what you do).</p> <p>Note however that to use some of these operators you need to have a sh-syntax shell installed (see <a href="#Pdksh">"Pdksh"</a>, <a href="#Frequently-asked-questions">"Frequently asked questions"</a>), and perl should be able to find it (see <a href="#PERL_SH_DIR">"<code>PERL_SH_DIR</code>"</a>).</p> <p>The cases when the shell is used are:</p> <ol> <li>
<p>One-argument system() (see <a href="perlfunc.html#system">"system" in perlfunc</a>), exec() (see <a href="perlfunc.html#exec">"exec" in perlfunc</a>) with redirection or shell meta-characters;</p> </li> <li>
<p>Pipe-open (see <a href="perlfunc.html#open">"open" in perlfunc</a>) with the command which contains redirection or shell meta-characters;</p> </li> <li>
<p>Backticks <code>``</code> (see <a href="perlop.html#I%2FO-Operators">"I/O Operators" in perlop</a>) with the command which contains redirection or shell meta-characters;</p> </li> <li>
<p>If the executable called by system()/exec()/pipe-open()/<code>``</code> is a script with the "magic" <code>#!</code> line or <code>extproc</code> line which specifies shell;</p> </li> <li>
<p>If the executable called by system()/exec()/pipe-open()/<code>``</code> is a script without "magic" line, and <code>$ENV{EXECSHELL}</code> is set to shell;</p> </li> <li>
<p>If the executable called by system()/exec()/pipe-open()/<code>``</code> is not found (is not this remark obsolete?);</p> </li> <li>
<p>For globbing (see <a href="perlfunc.html#glob">"glob" in perlfunc</a>, <a href="perlop.html#I%2FO-Operators">"I/O Operators" in perlop</a>) (obsolete? Perl uses builtin globbing nowadays...).</p> </li> </ol> <p>For the sake of speed for a common case, in the above algorithms backslashes in the command name are not considered as shell metacharacters.</p> <p>Perl starts scripts which begin with cookies <code>extproc</code> or <code>#!</code> directly, without an intervention of shell. Perl uses the same algorithm to find the executable as <i>pdksh</i>: if the path on <code>#!</code> line does not work, and contains <code>/</code>, then the directory part of the executable is ignored, and the executable is searched in <i>.</i> and on <code>PATH</code>. To find arguments for these scripts Perl uses a different algorithm than <i>pdksh</i>: up to 3 arguments are recognized, and trailing whitespace is stripped.</p> <p>If a script does not contain such a cooky, then to avoid calling <i>sh.exe</i>, Perl uses the same algorithm as <i>pdksh</i>: if <code>$ENV{EXECSHELL}</code> is set, the script is given as the first argument to this command, if not set, then <code>$ENV{COMSPEC} /c</code> is used (or a hardwired guess if <code>$ENV{COMSPEC}</code> is not set).</p> <p>When starting scripts directly, Perl uses exactly the same algorithm as for the search of script given by <b>-S</b> command-line option: it will look in the current directory, then on components of <code>$ENV{PATH}</code> using the following order of appended extensions: no extension, <i>.cmd</i>, <i>.btm</i>, <i>.bat</i>, <i>.pl</i>.</p> <p>Note that Perl will start to look for scripts only if OS/2 cannot start the specified application, thus <code>system 'blah'</code> will not look for a script if there is an executable file <i>blah.exe</i> <i>anywhere</i> on <code>PATH</code>. In other words, <code>PATH</code> is essentially searched twice: once by the OS for an executable, then by Perl for scripts.</p> <p>Note also that executable files on OS/2 can have an arbitrary extension, but <i>.exe</i> will be automatically appended if no dot is present in the name. The workaround is as simple as that: since <i>blah.</i> and <i>blah</i> denote the same file (at list on FAT and HPFS file systems), to start an executable residing in file <i>n:/bin/blah</i> (no extension) give an argument <code>n:/bin/blah.</code> (dot appended) to system().</p> <p>Perl will start PM programs from VIO (=text-mode) Perl process in a separate PM session; the opposite is not true: when you start a non-PM program from a PM Perl process, Perl would not run it in a separate session. If a separate session is desired, either ensure that shell will be used, as in <code>system 'cmd /c myprog'</code>, or start it using optional arguments to system() documented in <code>OS2::Process</code> module. This is considered to be a feature.</p> <h2 id="Frequently-asked-questions">

Automatic binary installation</h3> <p>The most convenient way of installing a binary distribution of perl is via perl installer <i>install.exe</i>. Just follow the instructions, and 99% of the installation blues would go away.</p> <p>Note however, that you need to have <i>unzip.exe</i> on your path, and EMX environment <i>running</i>.

Check EMX runtime by running</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">emxrev</code></pre> <p>Binary installer also creates a folder on your desktop with some useful objects. If you need to change some aspects of the work of the binary installer, feel free to edit the file <i>Perl.pkg</i>.

Manual binary installation</h3> <p>As of version 5.00305, OS/2 perl binary distribution comes split into 11 components. Unfortunately, to enable configurable binary installation, the file paths in the zip files are not absolute, but relative to some directory.</p> <p>Note that the extraction with the stored paths is still necessary (default with unzip, specify <code>-d</code> to pkunzip). However, you need to know where to extract the files. You need also to manually change entries in <i>Config.sys</i> to reflect where did you put the files. Note that if you have some primitive unzipper (like <code>pkunzip</code>), you may get a lot of warnings/errors during unzipping. Upgrade to <code>(w)unzip</code>.</p> <p>Below is the sample of what to do to reproduce the configuration on my machine. In <i>VIEW.EXE</i> you can press <code>Ctrl-Insert</code> now, and cut-and-paste from the resulting file - created in the directory you started <i>VIEW.EXE</i> from.</p> <p>For each component, we mention environment variables related to each installation directory.

Running <code>make test</code> becomes meaningless, since the test are checking a previous build of perl (this situation is detected and reported by <i>os2/os2_base.t</i> test). Do not forget to unset <code>PERL_EMXLOAD_SEC</code> in environment.</p> <p>Also make sure that you have <i>/tmp</i> directory on the current drive, and <i>.</i> directory in your <code>LIBPATH</code>.

Building a binary distribution</h2> <p>[This section provides a short overview only...]</p> <p>Building should proceed differently depending on whether the version of perl you install is already present and used on your system, or is a new version not yet used. The description below assumes that the version is new, so installing its DLLs and <i>.pm</i> files will not disrupt the operation of your system even if some intermediate steps are not yet fully working.</p> <p>The other cases require a little bit more convoluted procedures. Below I suppose that the current version of Perl is <code>5.8.2</code>, so the executables are named accordingly.</p> <ol> <li>
<p>Fully build and test the Perl distribution. Make sure that no tests are failing with <code>test</code> and <code>aout_test</code> targets; fix the bugs in Perl and the Perl test suite detected by these tests. Make sure that <code>all_test</code> make target runs as clean as possible. Check that <i>os2/perlrexx.cmd</i> runs fine.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Fully install Perl, including <code>installcmd</code> target. Copy the generated DLLs to <code>LIBPATH</code>; copy the numbered Perl executables (as in <i>perl5.8.2.exe</i>) to <code>PATH</code>; copy <code>perl_.exe</code> to <code>PATH</code> as <code>perl_5.8.2.exe</code>. Think whether you need backward-compatibility DLLs. In most cases you do not need to install them yet; but sometime this may simplify the following steps.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Make sure that <code>CPAN.pm</code> can download files from CPAN. If not, you may need to manually install <code>Net::FTP</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Install the bundle <code>Bundle::OS2_default</code></p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl5.8.2 -MCPAN -e "install Bundle::OS2_default" &lt; nul |&amp; tee 00cpan_i_1</code></pre> <p>This may take a couple of hours on 1GHz processor (when run the first time).

Document all the bugs which are not fixed, and all the failures with unknown reasons. Inspect the produced logs <i>00cpan_i_1</i> to find suspiciously skipped tests, and other fishy events.</p> <p>Keep in mind that <i>installation</i> of some modules may fail too: for example, the DLLs to update may be already loaded by <i>CPAN.pm</i>.

make install</code></pre> <p>Some distributions may fail some tests, but you may want to install them anyway (as above, or via <code>force install</code> command of <code>CPAN.pm</code> shell-mode).</p> <p>Since this procedure may take quite a long time to complete, it makes sense to "freeze" your CPAN configuration by disabling periodic updates of the local copy of CPAN index: set <code>index_expire</code> to some big value (I use 365), then save the settings</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">CPAN&gt; o conf index_expire 365
CPAN&gt; o conf commit</code></pre> <p>Reset back to the default value <code>1</code> when you are finished.</p> </li> <li>
<p>When satisfied with the results, rerun the <code>installcmd</code> target. Now you can copy <code>perl5.8.2.exe</code> to <code>perl.exe</code>, and install the other OMF-build executables: <code>perl__.exe</code> etc. They are ready to be used.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Change to the <code>./pod</code> directory of the build tree, download the Perl logo <i>CamelGrayBig.BMP</i>, and run</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">( perl2ipf &gt; perl.ipf ) |&amp; tee 00ipf
ipfc /INF perl.ipf |&amp; tee 00inf</code></pre> <p>This produces the Perl docs online book <code>perl.INF</code>. Install in on <code>BOOKSHELF</code> path.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Now is the time to build statically linked executable <i>perl_.exe</i> which includes newly-installed via <code>Bundle::OS2_default</code> modules. Doing testing via <code>CPAN.pm</code> is going to be painfully slow, since it statically links a new executable per XS extension.</p> <p>Here is a possible workaround: create a toplevel <i>Makefile.PL</i> in <i>$CPANHOME/.cpan/build/</i> with contents being (compare with <a href="#Making-executables-with-a-custom-collection-of-statically-loaded-extensions">"Making executables with a custom collection of statically loaded extensions"</a>)</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
WriteMakefile NAME =&gt; 'dummy';</code></pre> <p>execute this as</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl_5.8.2.exe Makefile.PL &lt;nul |&amp; tee 00aout_c1
make -k all test &lt;nul |&amp; 00aout_t1</code></pre> <p>Again, this procedure should not be absolutely smooth. Some <code>Makefile.PL</code>'s in subdirectories may be buggy, and would not run as "child" scripts. The interdependency of modules can strike you; however, since non-XS modules are already installed, the prerequisites of most modules have a very good chance to be present.</p> <p>If you discover some glitches, move directories of problematic modules to a different location; if these modules are non-XS modules, you may just ignore them - they are already installed; the remaining, XS, modules you need to install manually one by one.</p> <p>After each such removal you need to rerun the <code>Makefile.PL</code>/<code>make</code> process; usually this procedure converges soon. (But be sure to convert all the necessary external C libraries from <i>.lib</i> format to <i>.a</i> format: run one of</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">emxaout foo.lib
emximp -o foo.a foo.lib</code></pre> <p>whichever is appropriate.) Also, make sure that the DLLs for external libraries are usable with executables compiled without <code>-Zmtd</code> options.</p> <p>When you are sure that only a few subdirectories lead to failures, you may want to add <code>-j4</code> option to <code>make</code> to speed up skipping subdirectories with already finished build.</p> <p>When you are satisfied with the results of tests, install the build C libraries for extensions:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">make install |&amp; tee 00aout_i</code></pre> <p>Now you can rename the file <i>./perl.exe</i> generated during the last phase to <i>perl_5.8.2.exe</i>; place it on <code>PATH</code>; if there is an inter-dependency between some XS modules, you may need to repeat the <code>test</code>/<code>install</code> loop with this new executable and some excluded modules - until the procedure converges.</p> <p>Now you have all the necessary <i>.a</i> libraries for these Perl modules in the places where Perl builder can find it. Use the perl builder: change to an empty directory, create a "dummy" <i>Makefile.PL</i> again, and run</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl_5.8.2.exe Makefile.PL |&amp; tee 00c
make perl		     |&amp; tee 00p</code></pre> <p>This should create an executable <i>./perl.exe</i> with all the statically loaded extensions built in. Compare the generated <i>perlmain.c</i> files to make sure that during the iterations the number of loaded extensions only increases. Rename <i>./perl.exe</i> to <i>perl_5.8.2.exe</i> on <code>PATH</code>.</p> <p>When it converges, you got a functional variant of <i>perl_5.8.2.exe</i>; copy it to <code>perl_.exe</code>. You are done with generation of the local Perl installation.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Make sure that the installed modules are actually installed in the location of the new Perl, and are not inherited from entries of @INC given for inheritance from the older versions of Perl: set <code>PERLLIB_582_PREFIX</code> to redirect the new version of Perl to a new location, and copy the installed files to this new location. Redo the tests to make sure that the versions of modules inherited from older versions of Perl are not needed.</p> <p>Actually, the log output of <a href="http://man.he.net/man1/pod2ipf">pod2ipf(1)</a> during the step 6 gives a very detailed info about which modules are loaded from which place; so you may use it as an additional verification tool.</p> <p>Check that some temporary files did not make into the perl install tree. Run something like this</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">pfind . -f "!(/\.(pm|pl|ix|al|h|a|lib|txt|pod|imp|bs|dll|ld|bs|inc|xbm|yml|cgi|uu|e2x|skip|packlist|eg|cfg|html|pub|enc|all|ini|po|pot)$/i or /^\w+$/") | less</code></pre> <p>in the install tree (both top one and <i>sitelib</i> one).</p> <p>Compress all the DLLs with <i>lxlite</i>. The tiny <i>.exe</i> can be compressed with <code>/c:max</code> (the bug only appears when there is a fixup in the last 6 bytes of a page (?); since the tiny executables are much smaller than a page, the bug will not hit). Do not compress <code>perl_.exe</code> - it would not work under DOS.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Now you can generate the binary distribution. This is done by running the test of the CPAN distribution <code>OS2::SoftInstaller</code>. Tune up the file <i>test.pl</i> to suit the layout of current version of Perl first. Do not forget to pack the necessary external DLLs accordingly. Include the description of the bugs and test suite failures you could not fix. Include the small-stack versions of Perl executables from Perl build directory.</p> <p>Include <i>perl5.def</i> so that people can relink the perl DLL preserving the binary compatibility, or can create compatibility DLLs. Include the diff files (<code>diff -pu old new</code>) of fixes you did so that people can rebuild your version. Include <i>perl5.map</i> so that one can use remote debugging.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Share what you did with the other people. Relax. Enjoy fruits of your work.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Brace yourself for thanks, bug reports, hate mail and spam coming as result of the previous step. No good deed should remain unpunished!</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="Building-custom-.EXE-files">
Building custom <i>.EXE</i> files</h2> <p>The Perl executables can be easily rebuilt at any moment. Moreover, one can use the <i>embedding</i> interface (see <a href="perlembed.html">perlembed</a>) to make very customized executables.</p> <h3 id="Making-executables-with-a-custom-collection-of-statically-loaded-extensions">
Making executables with a custom collection of statically loaded extensions</h3> <p>It is a little bit easier to do so while <i>decreasing</i> the list of statically loaded extensions. We discuss this case only here.</p> <ol> <li>
<p>Change to an empty directory, and create a placeholder &lt;Makefile.PL&gt;:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
WriteMakefile NAME =&gt; 'dummy';</code></pre> </li> <li>
<p>Run it with the flavor of Perl (<i>perl.exe</i> or <i>perl_.exe</i>) you want to rebuild.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl_ Makefile.PL</code></pre> </li> <li>
<p>Ask it to create new Perl executable:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">make perl</code></pre> <p>(you may need to manually add <code>PERLTYPE=-DPERL_CORE</code> to this commandline on some versions of Perl; the symptom is that the command-line globbing does not work from OS/2 shells with the newly-compiled executable; check with</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>.\perl.exe -wle "print for @ARGV" *</code></pre> <p>).</p> </li> <li>
<p>The previous step created <i>perlmain.c</i> which contains a list of newXS() calls near the end. Removing unnecessary calls, and rerunning</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">make perl</code></pre> <p>will produce a customized executable.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id="Making-executables-with-a-custom-search-paths">
Making executables with a custom search-paths</h3> <p>The default perl executable is flexible enough to support most usages. However, one may want something yet more flexible; for example, one may want to find Perl DLL relatively to the location of the EXE file; or one may want to ignore the environment when setting the Perl-library search patch, etc.</p> <p>If you fill comfortable with <i>embedding</i> interface (see <a href="perlembed.html">perlembed</a>), such things are easy to do repeating the steps outlined in <a href="#Making-executables-with-a-custom-collection-of-statically-loaded-extensions">"Making executables with a custom collection of statically loaded extensions"</a>, and doing more comprehensive edits to main() of <i>perlmain.c</i>. The people with little desire to understand Perl can just rename main(), and do necessary modification in a custom main() which calls the renamed function in appropriate time.</p> <p>However, there is a third way: perl DLL exports the main() function and several callbacks to customize the search path. Below is a complete example of a "Perl loader" which</p> <ol> <li>
<p>Looks for Perl DLL in the directory <code>$exedir/../dll</code>;</p> </li> <li>
<p>Prepends the above directory to <code>BEGINLIBPATH</code>;</p> </li> <li>
<p>Fails if the Perl DLL found via <code>BEGINLIBPATH</code> is different from what was loaded on step 1; e.g., another process could have loaded it from <code>LIBPATH</code> or from a different value of <code>BEGINLIBPATH</code>. In these cases one needs to modify the setting of the system so that this other process either does not run, or loads the DLL from <code>BEGINLIBPATH</code> with <code>LIBPATHSTRICT=T</code> (available with kernels after September 2000).</p> </li> <li>
<p>Loads Perl library from <code>$exedir/../dll/lib/</code>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Uses Bourne shell from <code>$exedir/../dll/sh/ksh.exe</code>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For best results compile the C file below with the same options as the Perl DLL. However, a lot of functionality will work even if the executable is not an EMX applications, e.g., if compiled with</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">gcc -Wall -DDOSISH -DOS2=1 -O2 -s -Zomf -Zsys perl-starter.c \

<code>system()</code>
</h3> <p>Multi-argument form of <code>system()</code> allows an additional numeric argument. The meaning of this argument is described in <a href="OS2::Process.html">OS2::Process</a>.</p> <p>When finding a program to run, Perl first asks the OS to look for executables on <code>PATH</code> (OS/2 adds extension <i>.exe</i> if no extension is present). If not found, it looks for a script with possible extensions added in this order: no extension, <i>.cmd</i>, <i>.btm</i>, <i>.bat</i>, <i>.pl</i>. If found, Perl checks the start of the file for magic strings <code>"#!"</code> and <code>"extproc "</code>. If found, Perl uses the rest of the first line as the beginning of the command line to run this script. The only mangling done to the first line is extraction of arguments (currently up to 3), and ignoring of the path-part of the "interpreter" name if it can't be found using the full path.</p> <p>E.g., <code>system 'foo', 'bar', 'baz'</code> may lead Perl to finding <i>C:/emx/bin/foo.cmd</i> with the first line being</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">extproc /bin/bash    -x   -c</code></pre> <p>If <i>/bin/bash.exe</i> is not found, then Perl looks for an executable <i>bash.exe</i> on <code>PATH</code>. If found in <i>C:/emx.add/bin/bash.exe</i>, then the above system() is translated to</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">system qw(C:/emx.add/bin/bash.exe -x -c C:/emx/bin/foo.cmd bar baz)</code></pre> <p>One additional translation is performed: instead of <i>/bin/sh</i> Perl uses the hardwired-or-customized shell (see <a href="#PERL_SH_DIR">"<code>PERL_SH_DIR</code>"</a>).</p> <p>The above search for "interpreter" is recursive: if <i>bash</i> executable is not found, but <i>bash.btm</i> is found, Perl will investigate its first line etc. The only hardwired limit on the recursion depth is implicit: there is a limit 4 on the number of additional arguments inserted before the actual arguments given to system(). In particular, if no additional arguments are specified on the "magic" first lines, then the limit on the depth is 4.</p> <p>If Perl finds that the found executable is of PM type when the current session is not, it will start the new process in a separate session of necessary type. Call via <code>OS2::Process</code> to disable this magic.</p> <p><b>WARNING</b>. Due to the described logic, you need to explicitly specify <i>.com</i> extension if needed. Moreover, if the executable <i>perl5.6.1</i> is requested, Perl will not look for <i>perl5.6.1.exe</i>. [This may change in the future.]</p> <h3 id="extproc-on-the-first-line">

<p>Apparently, IBM used a compiler (for some period of time around '95?) which changes FP mask right and left. This is not <i>that</i> bad for IBM's programs, but the same compiler was used for DLLs which are used with general-purpose applications. When these DLLs are used, the state of floating-point flags in the application is not predictable.</p> <p>What is much worse, some DLLs change the floating point flags when in _DLLInitTerm() (e.g., <i>TCP32IP</i>). This means that even if you do not <i>call</i> any function in the DLL, just the act of loading this DLL will reset your flags. What is worse, the same compiler was used to compile some HOOK DLLs. Given that HOOK dlls are executed in the context of <i>all</i> the applications in the system, this means a complete unpredictability of floating point flags on systems using such HOOK DLLs. E.g., <i>GAMESRVR.DLL</i> of <b>DIVE</b> origin changes the floating point flags on each write to the TTY of a VIO (windowed text-mode) applications.</p> <p>Some other (not completely debugged) situations when FP flags change include some video drivers (?), and some operations related to creation of the windows. People who code <b>OpenGL</b> may have more experience on this.</p> <p>Perl is generally used in the situation when all the floating-point exceptions are ignored, as is the default under EMX. If they are not ignored, some benign Perl programs would get a <code>SIGFPE</code> and would die a horrible death.</p> <p>To circumvent this, Perl uses two hacks. They help against <i>one</i> type of damage only: FP flags changed when loading a DLL.</p> <p>One of the hacks is to disable floating point exceptions on Perl startup (as is the default with EMX). This helps only with compile-time-linked DLLs changing the flags before main() had a chance to be called.</p> <p>The other hack is to restore FP flags after a call to dlopen(). This helps against similar damage done by DLLs _DLLInitTerm() at runtime. Currently no way to switch these hacks off is provided.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Modifications">Modifications</h3> <p>Perl modifies some standard C library calls in the following ways:</p> <dl> <dt id="popen"><code>popen</code></dt> <dd> <p><code>my_popen</code> uses <i>sh.exe</i> if shell is required, cf. <a href="#PERL_SH_DIR">"<code>PERL_SH_DIR</code>"</a>.</p> </dd> <dt id="tmpnam"><code>tmpnam</code></dt> <dd> <p>is created using <code>TMP</code> or <code>TEMP</code> environment variable, via <code>tempnam</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id="tmpfile"><code>tmpfile</code></dt> <dd> <p>If the current directory is not writable, file is created using modified <code>tmpnam</code>, so there may be a race condition.</p> </dd> <dt id="ctermid"><code>ctermid</code></dt> <dd> <p>a dummy implementation.</p> </dd> <dt id="stat"><code>stat</code></dt> <dd> <p><code>os2_stat</code> special-cases <i>/dev/tty</i> and <i>/dev/con</i>.</p> </dd> <dt id="mkdir,-rmdir">

Centralized management of resources</h3> <p>Since to call certain OS/2 API one needs to have a correctly initialized <code>Win</code> subsystem, OS/2-specific extensions may require getting <code>HAB</code>s and <code>HMQ</code>s. If an extension would do it on its own, another extension could fail to initialize.</p> <p>Perl provides a centralized management of these resources:</p> <dl> <dt id="HAB"><code>HAB</code></dt> <dd> <p>To get the HAB, the extension should call <code>hab = perl_hab_GET()</code> in C.

Use <code>serve = 1</code> below.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To get an <code>HMQ</code>, the extension should call <code>hmq = perl_hmq_GET(serve)</code> in C. After this call is performed, <code>hmq</code> may be accessed as <code>Perl_hmq</code>.</p> <p>To signal to Perl that HMQ is not needed any more, call <code>perl_hmq_UNSET(serve)</code>. Perl process will automatically morph/unmorph itself into/from a PM process if HMQ is needed/not-needed.

Do not call <code>perl_hmq_GET(1)</code> unless you are going to process messages on an orderly basis.</p> </dd> <dt id="Treating-errors-reported-by-OS/2-API">
Treating errors reported by OS/2 API</dt> <dd> <p>There are two principal conventions (it is useful to call them <code>Dos*</code> and <code>Win*</code> - though this part of the function signature is not always determined by the name of the API) of reporting the error conditions of OS/2 API. Most of <code>Dos*</code> APIs report the error code as the result of the call (so 0 means success, and there are many types of errors). Most of <code>Win*</code> API report success/fail via the result being <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code>; to find the reason for the failure one should call WinGetLastError() API.</p> <p>Some <code>Win*</code> entry points also overload a "meaningful" return value with the error indicator; having a 0 return value indicates an error. Yet some other <code>Win*</code> entry points overload things even more, and 0 return value may mean a successful call returning a valid value 0, as well as an error condition; in the case of a 0 return value one should call WinGetLastError() API to distinguish a successful call from a failing one.</p> <p>By convention, all the calls to OS/2 API should indicate their failures by resetting $^E. All the Perl-accessible functions which call OS/2 API may be broken into two classes: some die()s when an API error is encountered, the other report the error via a false return value (of course, this does not concern Perl-accessible functions which <i>expect</i> a failure of the OS/2 API call, having some workarounds coded).</p> <p>Obviously, in the situation of the last type of the signature of an OS/2 API, it is must more convenient for the users if the failure is indicated by die()ing: one does not need to check $^E to know that something went wrong. If, however, this solution is not desirable by some reason, the code in question should reset $^E to 0 before making this OS/2 API call, so that the caller of this Perl-accessible function has a chance to distinguish a success-but-0-return value from a failure.

Perl flavors</h2> <p>Because of idiosyncrasies of OS/2 one cannot have all the eggs in the same basket (though EMX environment tries hard to overcome this limitations, so the situation may somehow improve). There are 4 executables for Perl provided by the distribution:</p> <h3 id="perl.exe">
<i>perl.exe</i>
</h3> <p>The main workhorse. This is a chimera executable: it is compiled as an <code>a.out</code>-style executable, but is linked with <code>omf</code>-style dynamic library <i>perl.dll</i>, and with dynamic CRT DLL. This executable is a VIO application.</p> <p>It can load perl dynamic extensions, and it can fork().</p> <p><b>Note.</b> Keep in mind that fork() is needed to open a pipe to yourself.</p> <h3 id="perl_.exe">
<i>perl_.exe</i>
</h3> <p>This is a statically linked <code>a.out</code>-style executable. It cannot load dynamic Perl extensions. The executable supplied in binary distributions has a lot of extensions prebuilt, thus the above restriction is important only if you use custom-built extensions. This executable is a VIO application.</p> <p><i>This is the only executable with does not require OS/2.</i> The friends locked into <code>M$</code> world would appreciate the fact that this executable runs under DOS, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT with an appropriate extender. See <a href="#Other-OSes">"Other OSes"</a>.</p> <h3 id="perl__.exe">
<i>perl__.exe</i>
</h3> <p>This is the same executable as <i>perl___.exe</i>, but it is a PM application.</p> <p><b>Note.</b> Usually (unless explicitly redirected during the startup) STDIN, STDERR, and STDOUT of a PM application are redirected to <i>nul</i>. However, it is possible to <i>see</i> them if you start <code>perl__.exe</code> from a PM program which emulates a console window, like <i>Shell mode</i> of Emacs or EPM. Thus it <i>is possible</i> to use Perl debugger (see <a href="perldebug.html">perldebug</a>) to debug your PM application (but beware of the message loop lockups - this will not work if you have a message queue to serve, unless you hook the serving into the getc() function of the debugger).</p> <p>Another way to see the output of a PM program is to run it as</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">pm_prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat -</code></pre> <p>with a shell <i>different</i> from <i>cmd.exe</i>, so that it does not create a link between a VIO session and the session of <code>pm_porg</code>. (Such a link closes the VIO window.) E.g., this works with <i>sh.exe</i> - or with Perl!</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open P, 'pm_prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 |' or die;
print while &lt;P&gt;;</code></pre> <p>The flavor <i>perl__.exe</i> is required if you want to start your program without a VIO window present, but not <code>detach</code>ed (run <code>help detach</code> for more info). Very useful for extensions which use PM, like <code>Perl/Tk</code> or <code>OpenGL</code>.</p> <p>Note also that the differences between PM and VIO executables are only in the <i>default</i> behaviour. One can start <i>any</i> executable in <i>any</i> kind of session by using the arguments <code>/fs</code>, <code>/pm</code> or <code>/win</code> switches of the command <code>start</code> (of <i>CMD.EXE</i> or a similar shell). Alternatively, one can use the numeric first argument of the <code>system</code> Perl function (see <a href="OS2::Process.html">OS2::Process</a>).</p> <h3 id="perl___.exe">
<i>perl___.exe</i>
</h3> <p>This is an <code>omf</code>-style executable which is dynamically linked to <i>perl.dll</i> and CRT DLL. I know no advantages of this executable over <code>perl.exe</code>, but it cannot fork() at all. Well, one advantage is that the build process is not so convoluted as with <code>perl.exe</code>.</p> <p>It is a VIO application.</p> <h3 id="Why-strange-names?">
Why strange names?</h3> <p>Since Perl processes the <code>#!</code>-line (cf. <a href="perlrun.html#DESCRIPTION">"DESCRIPTION" in perlrun</a>, <a href="perlrun.html#Command-Switches">"Command Switches" in perlrun</a>, <a href="perldiag.html#No-Perl-script-found-in-input">"No Perl script found in input" in perldiag</a>), it should know when a program <i>is a Perl</i>. There is some naming convention which allows Perl to distinguish correct lines from wrong ones. The above names are almost the only names allowed by this convention which do not contain digits (which have absolutely different semantics).</p> <h3 id="Why-dynamic-linking?">
Why dynamic linking?</h3> <p>Well, having several executables dynamically linked to the same huge library has its advantages, but this would not substantiate the additional work to make it compile. The reason is the complicated-to-developers but very quick and convenient-to-users "hard" dynamic linking used by OS/2.</p> <p>There are two distinctive features of the dyna-linking model of OS/2: first, all the references to external functions are resolved at the compile time; second, there is no runtime fixup of the DLLs after they are loaded into memory. The first feature is an enormous advantage over other models: it avoids conflicts when several DLLs used by an application export entries with the same name. In such cases "other" models of dyna-linking just choose between these two entry points using some random criterion - with predictable disasters as results. But it is the second feature which requires the build of <i>perl.dll</i>.</p> <p>The address tables of DLLs are patched only once, when they are loaded. The addresses of the entry points into DLLs are guaranteed to be the same for all the programs which use the same DLL. This removes the runtime fixup - once DLL is loaded, its code is read-only.</p> <p>While this allows some (significant?) performance advantages, this makes life much harder for developers, since the above scheme makes it impossible for a DLL to be "linked" to a symbol in the <i>.EXE</i> file. Indeed, this would need a DLL to have different relocations tables for the (different) executables which use this DLL.</p> <p>However, a dynamically loaded Perl extension is forced to use some symbols from the perl executable, e.g., to know how to find the arguments to the functions: the arguments live on the perl internal evaluation stack. The solution is to put the main code of the interpreter into a DLL, and make the <i>.EXE</i> file which just loads this DLL into memory and supplies command-arguments. The extension DLL cannot link to symbols in <i>.EXE</i>, but it has no problem linking to symbols in the <i>.DLL</i>.</p> <p>This <i>greatly</i> increases the load time for the application (as well as complexity of the compilation). Since interpreter is in a DLL, the C RTL is basically forced to reside in a DLL as well (otherwise extensions would not be able to use CRT). There are some advantages if you use different flavors of perl, such as running <i>perl.exe</i> and <i>perl__.exe</i> simultaneously: they share the memory of <i>perl.dll</i>.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>. There is one additional effect which makes DLLs more wasteful: DLLs are loaded in the shared memory region, which is a scarse resource given the 512M barrier of the "standard" OS/2 virtual memory. The code of <i>.EXE</i> files is also shared by all the processes which use the particular <i>.EXE</i>, but they are "shared in the private address space of the process"; this is possible because the address at which different sections of the <i>.EXE</i> file are loaded is decided at compile-time, thus all the processes have these sections loaded at same addresses, and no fixup of internal links inside the <i>.EXE</i> is needed.</p> <p>Since DLLs may be loaded at run time, to have the same mechanism for DLLs one needs to have the address range of <i>any of the loaded</i> DLLs in the system to be available <i>in all the processes</i> which did not load a particular DLL yet. This is why the DLLs are mapped to the shared memory region.</p> <h3 id="Why-chimera-build?">
Why chimera build?</h3> <p>Current EMX environment does not allow DLLs compiled using Unixish <code>a.out</code> format to export symbols for data (or at least some types of data). This forces <code>omf</code>-style compile of <i>perl.dll</i>.</p> <p>Current EMX environment does not allow <i>.EXE</i> files compiled in <code>omf</code> format to fork(). fork() is needed for exactly three Perl operations:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>explicit fork() in the script,</p> </li> <li>
<p><code>open FH, "|-"</code></p> </li> <li>
<p><code>open FH, "-|"</code>, in other words, opening pipes to itself.</p> </li> </ul> <p>While these operations are not questions of life and death, they are needed for a lot of useful scripts.

Text-mode filehandles</h3> <p>Starting from version 5.8, Perl uses a builtin translation layer for text-mode files. This replaces the efficient well-tested EMX layer by some code which should be best characterized as a "quick hack".</p> <p>In addition to possible bugs and an inability to follow changes to the translation policy with off/on switches of TERMIO translation, this introduces a serious incompatible change: before sysread() on text-mode filehandles would go through the translation layer, now it would not.</p> <h3 id="Priorities">Priorities</h3> <p><code>setpriority</code> and <code>getpriority</code> are not compatible with earlier ports by Andreas Kaiser. See <a href="#setpriority%2C-getpriority">"setpriority, getpriority"</a>.</p> <h3 id="DLL-name-mangling:-pre-5.6.2">
DLL name mangling: pre 5.6.2</h3> <p>With the release 5.003_01 the dynamically loadable libraries should be rebuilt when a different version of Perl is compiled. In particular, DLLs (including <i>perl.dll</i>) are now created with the names which contain a checksum, thus allowing workaround for OS/2 scheme of caching DLLs.</p> <p>It may be possible to code a simple workaround which would</p> <ul> <li>
<p>find the old DLLs looking through the old @INC;</p> </li> <li>
<p>mangle the names according to the scheme of new perl and copy the DLLs to these names;</p> </li> <li>
<p>edit the internal <code>LX</code> tables of DLL to reflect the change of the name (probably not needed for Perl extension DLLs, since the internally coded names are not used for "specific" DLLs, they used only for "global" DLLs).</p> </li> <li>
<p>edit the internal <code>IMPORT</code> tables and change the name of the "old" <i>perl????.dll</i> to the "new" <i>perl????.dll</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="DLL-name-mangling:-5.6.2-and-beyond">
DLL name mangling: 5.6.2 and beyond</h3> <p>In fact mangling of <i>extension</i> DLLs was done due to misunderstanding of the OS/2 dynaloading model. OS/2 (effectively) maintains two different tables of loaded DLL:</p> <dl> <dt id="Global-DLLs">
Global DLLs</dt> <dd> <p>those loaded by the base name from <code>LIBPATH</code>; including those associated at link time;</p> </dd> <dt id="specific-DLLs">
specific DLLs</dt> <dd> <p>loaded by the full name.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>When resolving a request for a global DLL, the table of already-loaded specific DLLs is (effectively) ignored; moreover, specific DLLs are <i>always</i> loaded from the prescribed path.</p> <p>There is/was a minor twist which makes this scheme fragile: what to do with DLLs loaded from</p> <dl> <dt id="BEGINLIBPATH-and-ENDLIBPATH">
<code>BEGINLIBPATH</code> and <code>ENDLIBPATH</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>(which depend on the process)</p> </dd> <dt id=".-from-LIBPATH">
<i>.</i> from <code>LIBPATH</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>which <i>effectively</i> depends on the process (although <code>LIBPATH</code> is the same for all the processes).</p> </dd> </dl> <p>Unless <code>LIBPATHSTRICT</code> is set to <code>T</code> (and the kernel is after 2000/09/01), such DLLs are considered to be global. When loading a global DLL it is first looked in the table of already-loaded global DLLs. Because of this the fact that one executable loaded a DLL from <code>BEGINLIBPATH</code> and <code>ENDLIBPATH</code>, or <i>.</i> from <code>LIBPATH</code> may affect <i>which</i> DLL is loaded when <i>another</i> executable requests a DLL with the same name. <i>This</i> is the reason for version-specific mangling of the DLL name for perl DLL.</p> <p>Since the Perl extension DLLs are always loaded with the full path, there is no need to mangle their names in a version-specific ways: their directory already reflects the corresponding version of perl, and @INC takes into account binary compatibility with older version. Starting from <code>5.6.2</code> the name mangling scheme is fixed to be the same as for Perl 5.005_53 (same as in a popular binary release). Thus new Perls will be able to <i>resolve the names</i> of old extension DLLs if @INC allows finding their directories.</p> <p>However, this still does not guarantee that these DLL may be loaded. The reason is the mangling of the name of the <i>Perl DLL</i>. And since the extension DLLs link with the Perl DLL, extension DLLs for older versions would load an older Perl DLL, and would most probably segfault (since the data in this DLL is not properly initialized).</p> <p>There is a partial workaround (which can be made complete with newer OS/2 kernels): create a forwarder DLL with the same name as the DLL of the older version of Perl, which forwards the entry points to the newer Perl's DLL. Make this DLL accessible on (say) the <code>BEGINLIBPATH</code> of the new Perl executable. When the new executable accesses old Perl's extension DLLs, they would request the old Perl's DLL by name, get the forwarder instead, so effectively will link with the currently running (new) Perl DLL.</p> <p>This may break in two ways:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>Old perl executable is started when a new executable is running has loaded an extension compiled for the old executable (ouph!). In this case the old executable will get a forwarder DLL instead of the old perl DLL, so would link with the new perl DLL. While not directly fatal, it will behave the same as new executable. This beats the whole purpose of explicitly starting an old executable.</p> </li> <li>
<p>A new executable loads an extension compiled for the old executable when an old perl executable is running. In this case the extension will not pick up the forwarder - with fatal results.</p> </li> </ul> <p>With support for <code>LIBPATHSTRICT</code> this may be circumvented - unless one of DLLs is started from <i>.</i> from <code>LIBPATH</code> (I do not know whether <code>LIBPATHSTRICT</code> affects this case).</p> <p><b>REMARK</b>. Unless newer kernels allow <i>.</i> in <code>BEGINLIBPATH</code> (older do not), this mess cannot be completely cleaned. (It turns out that as of the beginning of 2002, <i>.</i> is not allowed, but <i>.\.</i> is - and it has the same effect.)</p> <p><b>REMARK</b>. <code>LIBPATHSTRICT</code>, <code>BEGINLIBPATH</code> and <code>ENDLIBPATH</code> are not environment variables, although <i>cmd.exe</i> emulates them on <code>SET ...</code> lines. From Perl they may be accessed by <a href="#Cwd%3A%3AextLibpath%28%5Btype%5D%29">Cwd::extLibpath</a> and <a href="#Cwd%3A%3AextLibpath_set%28-path-%5B%2C-type-%5D-%29">Cwd::extLibpath_set</a>.</p> <h3 id="DLL-forwarder-generation">

Calls to external programs</h3> <p>Due to a popular demand the perl external program calling has been changed wrt Andreas Kaiser's port. <i>If</i> perl needs to call an external program <i>via shell</i>, the <i>f:/bin/sh.exe</i> will be called, or whatever is the override, see <a href="#PERL_SH_DIR">"<code>PERL_SH_DIR</code>"</a>.</p> <p>Thus means that you need to get some copy of a <i>sh.exe</i> as well (I use one from pdksh). The path <i>F:/bin</i> above is set up automatically during the build to a correct value on the builder machine, but is overridable at runtime,</p> <p><b>Reasons:</b> a consensus on <code>perl5-porters</code> was that perl should use one non-overridable shell per platform. The obvious choices for OS/2 are <i>cmd.exe</i> and <i>sh.exe</i>. Having perl build itself would be impossible with <i>cmd.exe</i> as a shell, thus I picked up <code>sh.exe</code>. This assures almost 100% compatibility with the scripts coming from *nix. As an added benefit this works as well under DOS if you use DOS-enabled port of pdksh (see <a href="#Prerequisites">"Prerequisites"</a>).</p> <p><b>Disadvantages:</b> currently <i>sh.exe</i> of pdksh calls external programs via fork()/exec(), and there is <i>no</i> functioning exec() on OS/2. exec() is emulated by EMX by an asynchronous call while the caller waits for child completion (to pretend that the <code>pid</code> did not change). This means that 1 <i>extra</i> copy of <i>sh.exe</i> is made active via fork()/exec(), which may lead to some resources taken from the system (even if we do not count extra work needed for fork()ing).</p> <p>Note that this a lesser issue now when we do not spawn <i>sh.exe</i> unless needed (metachars found).</p> <p>One can always start <i>cmd.exe</i> explicitly via</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">system 'cmd', '/c', 'mycmd', 'arg1', 'arg2', ...</code></pre> <p>If you need to use <i>cmd.exe</i>, and do not want to hand-edit thousands of your scripts, the long-term solution proposed on p5-p is to have a directive</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use OS2::Cmd;</code></pre> <p>which will override system(), exec(), <code>``</code>, and <code>open(,'...|')</code>. With current perl you may override only system(), readpipe() - the explicit version of <code>``</code>, and maybe exec(). The code will substitute the one-argument call to system() by <code>CORE::system('cmd.exe', '/c', shift)</code>.</p> <p>If you have some working code for <code>OS2::Cmd</code>, please send it to me, I will include it into distribution. I have no need for such a module, so cannot test it.</p> <p>For the details of the current situation with calling external programs, see <a href="#Starting-OS%2F2-%28and-DOS%29-programs-under-Perl">"Starting OS/2 (and DOS) programs under Perl"</a>. Set us mention a couple of features:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>External scripts may be called by their basename. Perl will try the same extensions as when processing <b>-S</b> command-line switch.</p> </li> <li>
<p>External scripts starting with <code>#!</code> or <code>extproc </code> will be executed directly, without calling the shell, by calling the program specified on the rest of the first line.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Memory-allocation">
Memory allocation</h3> <p>Perl uses its own malloc() under OS/2 - interpreters are usually malloc-bound for speed, but perl is not, since its malloc is lightning-fast. Perl-memory-usage-tuned benchmarks show that Perl's malloc is 5 times quicker than EMX one. I do not have convincing data about memory footprint, but a (pretty random) benchmark showed that Perl's one is 5% better.</p> <p>Combination of perl's malloc() and rigid DLL name resolution creates a special problem with library functions which expect their return value to be free()d by system's free(). To facilitate extensions which need to call such functions, system memory-allocation functions are still available with the prefix <code>emx_</code> added. (Currently only DLL perl has this, it should propagate to <i>perl_.exe</i> shortly.)</p> <h3 id="Threads">Threads</h3> <p>One can build perl with thread support enabled by providing <code>-D usethreads</code> option to <i>Configure</i>. Currently OS/2 support of threads is very preliminary.</p> <p>Most notable problems:</p> <dl> <dt id="COND_WAIT"><code>COND_WAIT</code></dt> <dd> <p>may have a race condition (but probably does not due to edge-triggered nature of OS/2 Event semaphores). (Needs a reimplementation (in terms of chaining waiting threads, with the linked list stored in per-thread structure?)?)</p> </dd> <dt id="os2.c">
<i>os2.c</i>
</dt> <dd> <p>has a couple of static variables used in OS/2-specific functions. (Need to be moved to per-thread structure, or serialized?)</p> </dd> </dl> <p>Note that these problems should not discourage experimenting, since they have a low probability of affecting small programs.</p> <h2 id="BUGS">BUGS</h2> <p>This description is not updated often (since 5.6.1?), see <i>./os2/Changes</i> for more info.</p> <h2 id="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</h2> <p>Ilya Zakharevich, cpan@ilyaz.org</p> <h2 id="SEE-ALSO">
