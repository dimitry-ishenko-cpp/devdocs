A further restriction is that the digits all have to be of the same form. A half-width digit mixed with a full-width one will return <code>undef</code>. The Arabic script has two sets of digits; <code>num</code> will return <code>undef</code> unless all the digits in the string come from the same set.

The final example demonstrates that the <code>"Is_"</code> prefix is recognized for these extensions; it is needed to resolve ambiguities. For example, <code>prop_aliases('lc')</code> returns the list <code>(lc, Lowercase_Mapping)</code>, but <code>prop_aliases('islc')</code> returns <code>(Is_LC, Cased_Letter)</code>. This is because <code>islc</code> is a Perl extension which is short for <code>General_Category=Cased Letter</code>.

These both return <code>(Is_LC, Cased_Letter)</code>. Thus this function allows you to take a discouraged form, and find its acceptable alternatives. The same goes with single-form Block property equivalences. Only the forms that begin with <code>"In_"</code> are not discouraged; if you pass <code>prop_aliases</code> a discouraged form, you will get back the equivalent ones that begin with <code>"In_"</code>.

say join ", ", prop_invlist("ASCII_Hex_Digit=No");

prints:
0, 48, 58, 65, 71, 97, 103

say join ", ", prop_invlist("ASCII_Hex_Digit=Yes");

prints:
48, 58, 65, 71, 97, 103</code></pre> <p>Inversion lists are a compact way of specifying Unicode property-value definitions. The 0th item in the list is the lowest code point that has the property-value. The next item (item [1]) is the lowest code point beyond that one that does NOT have the property-value. And the next item beyond that ([2]) is the lowest code point beyond that one that does have the property-value, and so on. Put another way, each element in the list gives the beginning of a range that has the property-value (for even numbered elements), or doesn't have the property-value (for odd numbered elements). The name for this data structure stems from the fact that each element in the list toggles (or inverts) whether the corresponding range is or isn't on the list.</p> <p>In the final example above, the first ASCII Hex digit is code point 48, the character "0", and all code points from it through 57 (a "9") are ASCII hex digits. Code points 58 through 64 aren't, but 65 (an "A") through 70 (an "F") are, as are 97 ("a") through 102 ("f"). 103 starts a range of code points that aren't ASCII hex digits. That range extends to infinity, which on your computer can be found in the variable <code>$Unicode::UCD::MAX_CP</code>. (This variable is as close to infinity as Perl can get on your platform, and may be too high for some operations to work; you may wish to use a smaller number for your purposes.)</p> <p>Note that the inversion lists returned by this function can possibly include non-Unicode code points, that is anything above 0x10FFFF. Unicode properties are not defined on such code points. You might wish to change the output to not include these. Simply add 0x110000 at the end of the non-empty returned list if it isn't already that value; and pop that value if it is; like:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @list = prop_invlist("foo");
if (@list) {
    if ($list[-1] == 0x110000) {
        pop @list;  # Defeat the turning on for above Unicode
    }
    else {
        push @list, 0x110000; # Turn off for above Unicode
    }
}</code></pre> <p>It is a simple matter to expand out an inversion list to a full list of all code points that have the property-value:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @invlist = prop_invlist($property_name);
die "empty" unless @invlist;
my @full_list;
for (my $i = 0; $i &lt; @invlist; $i += 2) {
   my $upper = ($i + 1) &lt; @invlist
               ? $invlist[$i+1] - 1      # In range
               : $Unicode::UCD::MAX_CP;  # To infinity.
   for my $j ($invlist[$i] .. $upper) {
       push @full_list, $j;
   }
}</code></pre> <p><code>prop_invlist</code> does not know about any user-defined nor Perl internal-only properties, and will return <code>undef</code> if called with one of those.</p> <p>The <a href="#search_invlist%28%29">"search_invlist()"</a> function is provided for finding a code point within an inversion list.</p> <h3 id="prop_invmap()">

An inversion map consists of two parallel arrays. One is an ordered list of code points that mark range beginnings, and the other gives the value (or mapping) that all code points in the corresponding range have.</p> <p><code>prop_invmap</code> is called with the name of the desired property. The name is loosely matched, meaning that differences in case, white-space, hyphens, and underscores are not meaningful (except for the trailing underscore in the old-form grandfathered-in property <code>"L_"</code>, which is better written as <code>"LC"</code>, or even better, <code>"Gc=LC"</code>).</p> <p>Many Unicode properties have more than one name (or alias). <code>prop_invmap</code> understands all of these, including Perl extensions to them. Ambiguities are resolved as described above for <a href="#prop_aliases%28%29">"prop_aliases()"</a> (except if a property has both a complete mapping, and a binary <code>Y</code>/<code>N</code> mapping, then specifying the property name prefixed by <code>"is"</code> causes the binary one to be returned). The Perl internal property "Perl_Decimal_Digit, described below, is also accepted. An empty list is returned if the property name is unknown. See <a href="perluniprops.html#Properties-accessible-through-Unicode%3A%3AUCD">"Properties accessible through Unicode::UCD" in perluniprops</a> for the properties acceptable as inputs to this function.</p> <p>It is a fatal error to call this function except in list context.</p> <p>In addition to the two arrays that form the inversion map, <code>prop_invmap</code> returns two other values; one is a scalar that gives some details as to the format of the entries of the map array; the other is a default value, useful in maps whose format name begins with the letter <code>"a"</code>, as described <a href="#a">below in its subsection</a>; and for specialized purposes, such as converting to another data structure, described at the end of this main section.</p> <p>This means that <code>prop_invmap</code> returns a 4 element list. For example,</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my ($blocks_ranges_ref, $blocks_maps_ref, $format, $default)

242        0x110000    No_Block</code></pre> <p>The first line (with Index [0]) means that the value for code point 0 is "Basic Latin". The entry "0x0080" in the @blocks_ranges column in the second line means that the value from the first line, "Basic Latin", extends to all code points in the range from 0 up to but not including 0x0080, that is, through 127. In other words, the code points from 0 to 127 are all in the "Basic Latin" block. Similarly, all code points in the range from 0x0080 up to (but not including) 0x0100 are in the block named "Latin-1 Supplement", etc. (Notice that the return is the old-style block names; see <a href="#Old-style-versus-new-style-block-names">"Old-style versus new-style block names"</a>).</p> <p>The final line (with Index [242]) means that the value for all code points above the legal Unicode maximum code point have the value "No_Block", which is the term Unicode uses for a non-existing block.</p> <p>The arrays completely specify the mappings for all possible code points. The final element in an inversion map returned by this function will always be for the range that consists of all the code points that aren't legal Unicode, but that are expressible on the platform. (That is, it starts with code point 0x110000, the first code point above the legal Unicode maximum, and extends to infinity.) The value for that range will be the same that any typical unassigned code point has for the specified property. (Certain unassigned code points are not "typical"; for example the non-character code points, or those in blocks that are to be written right-to-left. The above-Unicode range's value is not based on these atypical code points.) It could be argued that, instead of treating these as unassigned Unicode code points, the value for this range should be <code>undef</code>. If you wish, you can change the returned arrays accordingly.</p> <p>The maps for almost all properties are simple scalars that should be interpreted as-is. These values are those given in the Unicode-supplied data files, which may be inconsistent as to capitalization and as to which synonym for a property-value is given. The results may be normalized by using the <a href="#prop_value_aliases%28%29">"prop_value_aliases()"</a> function.</p> <p>There are exceptions to the simple scalar maps. Some properties have some elements in their map list that are themselves lists of scalars; and some special strings are returned that are not to be interpreted as-is. Element [2] (placed into <code>$format</code> in the example above) of the returned four element list tells you if the map has any of these special elements or not, as follows:</p> <dl> <dt id="s"><b><code>s</code></b></dt> <dd> <p>means all the elements of the map array are simple scalars, with no special elements. Almost all properties are like this, like the <code>block</code> example above.</p> </dd> <dt id="sl"><b><code>sl</code></b></dt> <dd> <p>means that some of the map array elements have the form given by <code>"s"</code>, and the rest are lists of scalars. For example, here is a portion of the output of calling <code>prop_invmap</code>() with the "Script Extensions" property:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@scripts_ranges  @scripts_maps
     ...
     0x0953      Devanagari

     0x0970      Common</code></pre> <p>Here, the code points 0x964 and 0x965 are both used in Bengali, Devanagari, Gurmukhi, and Oriya, but no other scripts.</p> <p>The Name_Alias property is also of this form. But each scalar consists of two components: 1) the name, and 2) the type of alias this is. They are separated by a colon and a space. In Unicode 6.1, there are several alias types:</p> <dl> <dt id="correction"><code>correction</code></dt> <dd> <p>indicates that the name is a corrected form for the original name (which remains valid) for the same code point.</p> </dd> <dt id="control"><code>control</code></dt> <dd> <p>adds a new name for a control character.</p> </dd> <dt id="alternate"><code>alternate</code></dt> <dd> <p>is an alternate name for a character</p> </dd> <dt id="figment"><code>figment</code></dt> <dd> <p>is a name for a character that has been documented but was never in any actual standard.</p> </dd> <dt id="abbreviation"><code>abbreviation</code></dt> <dd> <p>is a common abbreviation for a character</p> </dd> </dl> <p>The lists are ordered (roughly) so the most preferred names come before less preferred ones.</p> <p>For example,</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@aliases_ranges        @alias_maps

For example, in:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my ($uppers_ranges_ref, $uppers_maps_ref, $format, $default)
                         = prop_invmap("Simple_Uppercase_Mapping");</code></pre> <p>the returned arrays look like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@$uppers_ranges_ref    @$uppers_maps_ref   Note

    182                      0
    ...</code></pre> <p>and <code>$default</code> is 0.</p> <p>Let's start with the second line. It says that the uppercase of code point 97 is 65; or <code>uc("a")</code> == "A". But the line is for the entire range of code points 97 through 122. To get the mapping for any code point in this range, you take the offset it has from the beginning code point of the range, and add that to the mapping for that first code point. So, the mapping for 122 ("z") is derived by taking the offset of 122 from 97 (=25) and adding that to 65, yielding 90 ("Z"). Likewise for everything in between.</p> <p>Requiring this simple adjustment allows the returned arrays to be significantly smaller than otherwise, up to a factor of 10, speeding up searching through them.</p> <p>Ranges that map to <code>$default</code>, <code>"0"</code>, behave somewhat differently. For these, each code point maps to itself. So, in the first line in the example, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>ord(uc(chr(0)))</code></span> is 0, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>ord(uc(chr(1)))</code></span> is 1, .. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>ord(uc(chr(96)))</code></span> is 96.</p> </dd> <dt id="al"><b><code>al</code></b></dt> <dd> <p>means that some of the map array elements have the form given by <code>"a"</code>, and the rest are ordered lists of code points. For example, in:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my ($uppers_ranges_ref, $uppers_maps_ref, $format, $default)
                                = prop_invmap("Uppercase_Mapping");</code></pre> <p>the returned arrays look like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@$uppers_ranges_ref    @$uppers_maps_ref

The only difference between the two in the ranges shown is that the code point at 0x0149 (LATIN SMALL LETTER N PRECEDED BY APOSTROPHE) maps to a string of two characters, 0x02BC (MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE) followed by 0x004E (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N).</p> <p>No adjustments are needed to entries that are references to arrays; each such entry will have exactly one element in its range, so the offset is always 0.</p> <p>The fourth (index [3]) element (<code>$default</code>) in the list returned for this format is 0.</p> </dd> <dt id="ae"><b><code>ae</code></b></dt> <dd> <p>This is like <code>"a"</code>, but some elements are the empty string, and should not be adjusted. The one internal Perl property accessible by <code>prop_invmap</code> is of this type: "Perl_Decimal_Digit" returns an inversion map which gives the numeric values that are represented by the Unicode decimal digit characters. Characters that don't represent decimal digits map to the empty string, like so:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@digits    @values

0x07C0:       0
0x07CA:      ""
0x0966:       0

Some of the map array elements have the forms given by <code>"al"</code>, and the rest are the empty string. The property <code>NFKC_Casefold</code> has this form. An example slice is:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@$ranges_ref  @$maps_ref         Note

A rational number is either an integer, or two integers separated by a solidus (<code>"/"</code>). The second integer represents the denominator of the division implied by the solidus, and is actually always positive, so it is guaranteed not to be 0 and to not be signed. When the element is a plain integer (without the solidus), it may need to be adjusted to get the correct value by adding the offset, just as other <code>"a"</code> properties. No adjustment is needed for fractions, as the range is guaranteed to have just a single element, and so the offset is always 0.</p> <p>If you want to convert the returned map to entirely scalar numbers, you can use something like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my ($invlist_ref, $invmap_ref, $format) = prop_invmap($property);

Unicode::UCD::UnicodeVersion</h3> <p>This returns the version of the Unicode Character Database, in other words, the version of the Unicode standard the database implements. The version is a string of numbers delimited by dots (<code>'.'</code>).</p> <h3 id="Blocks-versus-Scripts">
<b>Blocks versus Scripts</b>
</h3> <p>The difference between a block and a script is that scripts are closer to the linguistic notion of a set of code points required to represent languages, while block is more of an artifact of the Unicode code point numbering and separation into blocks of consecutive code points (so far the size of a block is some multiple of 16, like 128 or 256).</p> <p>For example the Latin <b>script</b> is spread over several <b>blocks</b>, such as <code>Basic Latin</code>, <code>Latin 1 Supplement</code>, <code>Latin Extended-A</code>, and <code>Latin Extended-B</code>. On the other hand, the Latin script does not contain all the characters of the <code>Basic Latin</code> block (also known as ASCII): it includes only the letters, and not, for example, the digits nor the punctuation.</p> <p>For blocks see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Blocks.txt">http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Blocks.txt</a></p> <p>For scripts see UTR #24: <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/</a></p> <h3 id="Matching-Scripts-and-Blocks">
<b>Matching Scripts and Blocks</b>
</h3> <p>Scripts are matched with the regular-expression construct <code>\p{...}</code> (e.g. <code>\p{Tibetan}</code> matches characters of the Tibetan script), while <code>\p{Blk=...}</code> is used for blocks (e.g. <code>\p{Blk=Tibetan}</code> matches any of the 256 code points in the Tibetan block).</p> <h3 id="Old-style-versus-new-style-block-names">
Old-style versus new-style block names</h3> <p>Unicode publishes the names of blocks in two different styles, though the two are equivalent under Unicode's loose matching rules.</p> <p>The original style uses blanks and hyphens in the block names (except for <code>No_Block</code>), like so:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B</code></pre> <p>The newer style replaces these with underscores, like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">Miscellaneous_Mathematical_Symbols_B</code></pre> <p>This newer style is consistent with the values of other Unicode properties. To preserve backward compatibility, all the functions in Unicode::UCD that return block names (except as noted) return the old-style ones. <a href="#prop_value_aliases%28%29">"prop_value_aliases()"</a> returns the new-style and can be used to convert from old-style to new-style:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $new_style = prop_values_aliases("block", $old_style);</code></pre> <p>Perl also has single-form extensions that refer to blocks, <code>In_Cyrillic</code>, meaning <code>Block=Cyrillic</code>. These have always been written in the new style.</p> <p>To convert from new-style to old-style, follow this recipe:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$old_style = charblock((prop_invlist("block=$new_style"))[0]);</code></pre> <p>(which finds the range of code points in the block using <code>prop_invlist</code>, gets the lower end of the range (0th element) and then looks up the old name for its block using <code>charblock</code>).</p> <p>Note that starting in Unicode 6.1, many of the block names have shorter synonyms. These are always given in the new style.</p> <h3 id="Use-with-older-Unicode-versions">
Use with older Unicode versions</h3> <p>The functions in this module work as well as can be expected when used on earlier Unicode versions. But, obviously, they use the available data from that Unicode version. For example, if the Unicode version predates the definition of the script property (Unicode 3.1), then any function that deals with scripts is going to return <code>undef</code> for the script portion of the return value.</p> <h2 id="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</h2> <p>Jarkko Hietaniemi.
