(D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
(S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
(F) A fatal error (trappable).
(P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
(X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
(A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</code></pre> <p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above (W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.</p> <p>If a message can be controlled by the <code>warnings</code> pragma, its warning category is included with the classification letter in the description below. E.g. <code>(W closed)</code> means a warning in the <code>closed</code> category.</p> <p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <b>-w</b> and <b>-W</b> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code> to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead of printing it. See <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>.</p> <p>Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled with the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <b>-X</b> switch.</p> <p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator. See <a href="perlfunc.html#eval">"eval" in perlfunc</a>. In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code>warnings</code> pragma. See <a href="warnings.html">warnings</a>.</p> <p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or lower-case. Some of these messages are generic. Spots that vary are denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape. These escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than letters. To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a letter.</p> <dl> <dt id="accept()-on-closed-socket-%s">
accept() on closed socket %s</dt> <dd> <p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call? See <a href="perlfunc.html#accept">"accept" in perlfunc</a>.</p> </dd> <dt id="ADJUST-is-experimental">
ADJUST is experimental</dt> <dd> <p>(S experimental::class) This warning is emitted if you use the <code>ADJUST</code> keyword of <code>use feature 'class'</code>. This keyword is currently experimental and its behaviour may change in future releases of Perl.</p> </dd> <dt id="Aliasing-via-reference-is-experimental">
Aliasing via reference is experimental</dt> <dd> <p>(S experimental::refaliasing) This warning is emitted if you use a reference constructor on the left-hand side of an assignment to alias one variable to another. Simply suppress the warning if you want to use the feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the risk of using an experimental feature which may change or be removed in a future Perl version:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>no warnings "experimental::refaliasing";
use feature "refaliasing";

Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</dt> <dd> <p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling one or the other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is not imported.</p> <p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's imported with the <code>use subs</code> pragma).</p> <p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code>CORE::</code> prefix on the operator (e.g. <code>CORE::log($x)</code>) or declare the subroutine to be an object method (see <a href="perlsub.html#Subroutine-Attributes">"Subroutine Attributes" in perlsub</a> or <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>).</p> </dd> <dt id="Ambiguous-range-in-transliteration-operator">
Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</dt> <dd> <p>(F) You wrote something like <code>tr/a-z-0//</code> which doesn't mean anything at all. To include a <code>-</code> character in a transliteration, put it either first or last. (In the past, <code>tr/a-z-0//</code> was synonymous with <code>tr/a-y//</code>, which was probably not what you would have expected.)</p> </dd> <dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-%s-resolved-as-%s">
Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</dt> <dd> <p>(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way you thought. Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</p> </dd> <dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-%s-resolved-as-&amp;%s()">
Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</dt> <dd> <p>(S ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>-foo</code>, which might be the string <code>"-foo"</code>, or a call to the function <code>foo</code>, negated. If you meant the string, just write <code>"-foo"</code>. If you meant the function call, write <code>-foo()</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-%c-resolved-as-operator-%c">
Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c</dt> <dd> <p>(S ambiguous) <code>%</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, and <code>*</code> are both infix operators (modulus, bitwise and, and multiplication) <i>and</i> initial special characters (denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something like <code>*foo * foo</code> that might be interpreted as either of them. We assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try to make it more clear -- in the example given, you might write <code>*foo * foo()</code> if you really meant to multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</p> </dd> <dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-%c{%s}-resolved-to-%c%s">
Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</dt> <dd> <p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>@{foo}</code>, which might be asking for the variable <code>@foo</code>, or it might be calling a function named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference. If you wanted the variable, you can just write <code>@foo</code>. If you wanted to call the function, write <code>@{foo()}</code> ... or you could just not have a variable and a function with the same name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</p> </dd> <dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-%c{%s[...]}-resolved-to-%c%s[...]">
Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</dt>  <dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-%c{%s{...}}-resolved-to-%c%s{...}">
Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</dt> <dd> <p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>${foo[2]}</code> (where foo represents the name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number 2 of the array named <code>@foo</code>, in which case please write <code>$foo[2]</code>, or you might have meant to pass an anonymous arrayref to the function named foo, and then do a scalar deref on the value it returns. If you meant that, write <code>${foo([2])}</code>.</p> <p>In regular expressions, the <code>${foo[2]}</code> syntax is sometimes necessary to disambiguate between array subscripts and character classes. <code>/$length[2345]/</code>, for instance, will be interpreted as <code>$length</code> followed by the character class <code>[2345]</code>. If an array subscript is what you want, you can avoid the warning by changing <code>/${length[2345]}/</code> to the unsightly <code>/${\$length[2345]}/</code>, by renaming your array to something that does not coincide with a built-in keyword, or by simply turning off warnings with <code>no warnings 'ambiguous';</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id="'|'-and-'&lt;'-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line">
'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt> <dd> <p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.

'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt> <dd> <p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and into a pipe to another command. You need to choose one or the other, though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script which 'splits' output into two streams, such as</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open(OUT,"&gt;$ARGV[0]") or die "Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!";

Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</dt> <dd> <p>(W misc) The pattern match (<code>//</code>), substitution (<code>s///</code>), and transliteration (<code>tr///</code>) operators work on scalar values. If you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length of an array, or the population info of a hash) and then work on that scalar value. This is probably not what you meant to do. See <a href="perlfunc.html#grep">"grep" in perlfunc</a> and <a href="perlfunc.html#map">"map" in perlfunc</a> for alternatives.</p> </dd> <dt id="Arg-too-short-for-msgsnd">

Argument "%s" isn't numeric%s</dt> <dd> <p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator that expected a numeric value instead. If you're fortunate the message will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</p> <p>Note that for the <code>Inf</code> and <code>NaN</code> (infinity and not-a-number) the definition of "numeric" is somewhat unusual: the strings themselves (like "Inf") are considered numeric, and anything following them is considered non-numeric.</p> </dd> <dt id='Argument-list-not-closed-for-PerlIO-layer-"%s"'>
Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer "%s"</dt> <dd> <p>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you forgot the ) that closes the argument list. (Layers take care of transforming data between external and internal representations.) Perl stopped parsing the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push this layer. If your program didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.</p> </dd> <dt id='Argument-"%s"-treated-as-0-in-increment-(++)'>
Argument "%s" treated as 0 in increment (++)</dt> <dd> <p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to the <code>++</code> operator which expects either a number or a string matching <code>/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*\z/</code>.

Array passed to stat will be coerced to a scalar%s</dt> <dd> <p>(W syntax) You called stat() on an array, but the array will be coerced to a scalar - the number of elements in the array.</p> </dd> <dt id="A-signature-parameter-must-start-with-'$',-'@'-or-'%'">
A signature parameter must start with '$', '@' or '%'</dt> <dd> <p>(F) Each subroutine signature parameter declaration must start with a valid sigil; for example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub foo ($a, $, $b = 1, @c) {}</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="A-slurpy-parameter-may-not-have-a-default-value">
A slurpy parameter may not have a default value</dt> <dd> <p>(F) Only scalar subroutine signature parameters may have a default value; for example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub foo ($a = 1)        {} # legal
sub foo (@a = (1))      {} # invalid
sub foo (%a = (a =&gt; b)) {} # invalid</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="assertion-botched:-%s">

Assigned value is not a reference</dt> <dd> <p>(F) You tried to assign something that was not a reference to an lvalue reference (e.g., <code>\$x = $y</code>). If you meant to make $x an alias to $y, use <code>\$x = \$y</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id="Assigned-value-is-not-%s-reference">
Assigned value is not %s reference</dt> <dd> <p>(F) You tried to assign a reference to a reference constructor, but the two references were not of the same type.

Assigning non-zero to $[ is no longer possible</dt> <dd> <p>(F) When the "array_base" feature is disabled (e.g., and under <code>use v5.16;</code>, and as of Perl 5.30) the special variable <code>$[</code>, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero value.</p> </dd> <dt id="Assignment-to-both-a-list-and-a-scalar">
Assignment to both a list and a scalar</dt> <dd> <p>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments must either both be scalars or both be lists.

Assuming NOT a POSIX class since %s in regex; marked by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> in m/%s/</dt> <dd> <p>(W regexp) You had something like these:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">[[:alnum]]

[[:digit:]xyz]</code></pre> <p>Since these aren't legal POSIX class specifications, but are legal bracketed character classes, Perl treats them as the latter. In the first example, it matches the characters <code>":"</code>, <code>"["</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"l"</code>, <code>"m"</code>, <code>"n"</code>, and <code>"u"</code>.</p> <p>If these weren't meant to be POSIX classes, this warning message is spurious, and can be suppressed by reordering things, such as</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">[[al:num]]</code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">[[:munla]]</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="&lt;&gt;-at-require-statement-should-be-quotes">

Attempt to bless into a freed package</dt> <dd> <p>(F) You wrote <code>bless $foo</code> with one argument after somehow causing the current package to be freed. Perl cannot figure out what to do, so it throws up its hands in despair.</p> </dd> <dt id="Attempt-to-bless-into-a-class">
Attempt to bless into a class</dt> <dd> <p>(F) You are attempting to call <code>bless</code> with a package name that is a new-style <code>class</code>. This is not necessary, as instances created by the constructor are already in the correct class. Instances cannot be created by other means, such as <code>bless</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id="Attempt-to-bless-into-a-reference">
Attempt to bless into a reference</dt> <dd> <p>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the bless() operator is expected to be the name of the package to bless the resulting object into.

Attempt to clear deleted array</dt> <dd> <p>(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed. Freed values are not supposed to be visible to Perl code.

Attempt to free nonexistent shared string '%s'%s</dt> <dd> <p>(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other strings. This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of a string that can no longer be found in the table.</p> </dd> <dt id="Attempt-to-free-temp-prematurely:-SV-0x%x">
Attempt to free temp prematurely: SV 0x%x</dt> <dd> <p>(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the free_tmps() routine. This indicates that something else is freeing the SV before the free_tmps() routine gets a chance, which means that the free_tmps() routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to free it.</p> </dd> <dt id="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-glob-pointers">
Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</dt> <dd> <p>(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p> </dd> <dt id="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-scalar:-SV-0x%x">
Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x</dt> <dd> <p>(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed. This could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or that SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV was mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been corrupted.</p> </dd> <dt id="Attempt-to-pack-pointer-to-temporary-value">
Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</dt> <dd> <p>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a function, or a computed expression) to the "p" pack() template. This means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement. Use literals or global values as arguments to the "p" pack() template to avoid this warning.</p> </dd> <dt id="Attempt-to-reload-%s-aborted.">
Attempt to reload %s aborted.</dt> <dd> <p>(F) You tried to load a file with <code>use</code> or <code>require</code> that failed to compile once already.

Attempt to set length of freed array</dt> <dd> <p>(W misc) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed. You can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last index of an array and later assigning through that reference.

$$r = 503</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="Attempt-to-use-reference-as-lvalue-in-substr">
Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</dt> <dd> <p>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to substr() used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.

Attribute prototype(%s) discards earlier prototype attribute in same sub</dt> <dd> <p>(W misc) A sub was declared as sub foo : prototype(A) : prototype(B) {}, for example.

av_reify called on tied array</dt> <dd> <p>(S debugging) This indicates that something went wrong and Perl got <i>very</i> confused about <code>@_</code> or <code>@DB::args</code> being tied.</p> </dd> <dt id="Bad-arg-length-for-%s,-is-%u,-should-be-%d">
Bad arg length for %s, is %u, should be %d</dt> <dd> <p>(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), semctl() or shmctl().

Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</dt> <dd> <p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. This arises because of the difference between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes. Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account. Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to the access-checking routine. It will try to retrieve the filespec using the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat() routine, because the device name is overwritten with each call. If this warning appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up and returned FALSE, just to be conservative. (Note: The access-checking routine knows about the Perl <code>stat</code> operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p> </dd> <dt id="Can't-get-pipe-mailbox-device-name">

Locale '%s' contains (at least) the following characters which have unexpected meanings: %s The Perl program will use the expected meanings</dt> <dd> <p>(W locale) You are using the named UTF-8 locale. UTF-8 locales are expected to have very particular behavior, which most do. This message arises when perl found some departures from the expectations, and is notifying you that the expected behavior overrides these differences. In some cases the differences are caused by the locale definition being defective, but the most common causes of this warning are when there are ambiguities and conflicts in following the Standard, and the locale has chosen an approach that differs from Perl's.</p> <p>One of these is because that, contrary to the claims, Unicode is not completely locale insensitive. Turkish and some related languages have two types of <code>"I"</code> characters. One is dotted in both upper- and lowercase, and the other is dotless in both cases. Unicode allows a locale to use either the Turkish rules, or the rules used in all other instances, where there is only one type of <code>"I"</code>, which is dotless in the uppercase, and dotted in the lower. The perl core does not (yet) handle the Turkish case, and this message warns you of that. Instead, the <a href="Unicode::Casing.html">Unicode::Casing</a> module allows you to mostly implement the Turkish casing rules.</p> <p>The other common cause is for the characters</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">$ + &lt; = &gt; ^ ` | ~</code></pre> <p>These are problematic. The C standard says that these should be considered punctuation in the C locale (and the POSIX standard defers to the C standard), and Unicode is generally considered a superset of the C locale. But Unicode has added an extra category, "Symbol", and classifies these particular characters as being symbols. Most UTF-8 locales have them treated as punctuation, so that <a href="http://man.he.net/man3/ispunct">ispunct(3)</a> returns non-zero for them. But a few locales have it return 0. Perl takes the first approach, not using <code>ispunct()</code> at all (see <a href="perlrecharclass.html#%5B5%5D">Note [5] in perlrecharclass</a>), and this message is raised to notify you that you are getting Perl's approach, not the locale's.</p> </dd> <dt id="Locale-'%s'-is-unsupported,-and-may-crash-the-interpreter.">

The only such locales that Perl can handle are the UTF-8 locales. Most likely the specified locale is a non-UTF-8 one for an East Asian language such as Chinese or Japanese.

This message occurs when you matched a string containing such a code point against a regular expression pattern, and the code point was matched against a Unicode property, <code>\p{...}</code> or <code>\P{...}</code>. Unicode properties are only defined on Unicode code points, so the result of this match is undefined by Unicode, but Perl (starting in v5.20) treats non-Unicode code points as if they were typical unassigned Unicode ones, and matched this one accordingly. Whether a given property matches these code points or not is specified in <a href="perluniprops.html#Properties-accessible-through-%5Cp%7B%7D-and-%5CP%7B%7D">"Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}" in perluniprops</a>.</p> <p>This message is suppressed (unless it has been made fatal) if it is immaterial to the results of the match if the code point is Unicode or not. For example, the property <code>\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}</code> only can match the 22 characters <code>[0-9A-Fa-f]</code>, so obviously all other code points, Unicode or not, won't match it. (And <code>\P{ASCII_Hex_Digit}</code> will match every code point except these 22.)</p> <p>Getting this message indicates that the outcome of the match arguably should have been the opposite of what actually happened.

Subroutine "&amp;%s" is not available</dt> <dd> <p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently available. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the lexical subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For example,</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \&amp;a } }</code></pre> <p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current "a" sub, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.

	my sub a {...}
	sub { eval '\&amp;a' }
    }

In other words, it will no longer be shared. This will especially make a difference if the lexical subroutines accesses lexical variables declared in its surrounding scope.</p> <p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine anonymous, using the <code>sub {}</code> syntax.

This use of my() in false conditional is no longer allowed</dt> <dd> <p>(F) You used a declaration similar to <code>my $x if 0</code>. There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a false conditional. Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of static variable. Since we intend to fix this bug, we don't want people relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block outside the function, eg</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }</code></pre> <p>becomes</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>{ my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }</code></pre> <p>Beginning with perl 5.10.0, you can also use <code>state</code> variables to have lexicals that are initialized only once (see <a href="feature.html">feature</a>):</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub f { state $x; return $x++ }</code></pre> <p>This use of <code>my()</code> in a false conditional was deprecated beginning in Perl 5.10 and became a fatal error in Perl 5.30.</p> </dd> <dt id="Timeout-waiting-for-another-thread-to-define-\p{%s}">

There could be a race if two or more threads tried to do this processing nearly simultaneously. Instead, a critical section is created around this task, locking out all but one thread from doing it. This message indicates that the thread that is doing the conversion is taking an unexpectedly long time.

This is an error because, by the time Perl discovers a <b>-T</b> in a script, it's too late to properly taint everything from the environment. So Perl gives up.</p> <p>If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #! mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed by editing the #! line so that the <b>-%c</b> option is a part of Perl's first argument: e.g. change <code>perl -n -%c</code> to <code>perl -%c -n</code>.</p> <p>If the Perl script is being executed as <code>perl scriptname</code>, then the <b>-%c</b> option must appear on the command line: <code>perl -%c scriptname</code>.</p> </dd> <dt id="To%s:-illegal-mapping-'%s'">

Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme for a delimiter is not allowed</dt> <dd> <p>(F) A grapheme is what appears to a native-speaker of a language to be a character. In Unicode (and hence Perl) a grapheme may actually be several adjacent characters that together form a complete grapheme. For example, there can be a base character, like "R" and an accent, like a circumflex "^", that appear when displayed to be a single character with the circumflex hovering over the "R". Perl currently allows things like that circumflex to be delimiters of strings, patterns, <i>etc</i>. When displayed, the circumflex would look like it belongs to the character just to the left of it. In order to move the language to be able to accept graphemes as delimiters, we cannot allow the use of delimiters which aren't graphemes by themselves. Also, a delimiter must already be assigned (or known to be never going to be assigned) to try to future-proof code, for otherwise code that works today would fail to compile if the currently unassigned delimiter ends up being something that isn't a stand-alone grapheme. Because Unicode is never going to assign <a href="perlunicode.html#Noncharacter-code-points">non-character code points</a>, nor <a href="%20perlunicode.html#Beyond-Unicode-code-points">code points that are above the legal Unicode maximum</a>, those can be delimiters, and their use is legal.</p> </dd> <dt id="Use-of-uninitialized-value%s">

See the <a href="perlre.html#%28%3F%3C%21pattern%29">documentation of Negative Lookbehind in perlre</a> for details. You may silence this warning with the following:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>no warnings 'experimental::vlb';</code></pre> </dd> <dt id='"%s"-variable-%s-masks-earlier-declaration-in-same-%s'>
"%s" variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</dt> <dd> <p>(W shadow) A "my", "our" or "state" variable has been redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the previous instance.

Note that the earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</p> </dd> <dt id="Variable-syntax">

Variable "%s" will not stay shared</dt> <dd> <p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.</p> <p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no longer share a common value for the variable. In other words, the variable will no longer be shared.</p> <p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine anonymous, using the <code>sub {}</code> syntax. When inner anonymous subs that reference variables in outer subroutines are created, they are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</p> </dd> <dt id="vector-argument-not-supported-with-alpha-versions">

Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly: %s</dt> <dd> <p>(S io) There were errors during the implicit close() done on a filehandle when its reference count reached zero while it was still open, e.g.:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>{
    open my $fh, '&gt;', $file  or die "open: '$file': $!\n";
    print $fh $data or die "print: $!";
} # implicit close here</code></pre> <p>Because various errors may only be detected by close() (e.g. buffering could allow the <code>print</code> in this example to return true even when the disk is full), it is dangerous to ignore its result.

Warning: Use of "%s" without parentheses is ambiguous</dt> <dd> <p>(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that looks like a binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a term or unary operator.

Additionally, it has several special cases that may not be immediately obvious, and it will be removed in Perl 5.42.

Wide character in %s</dt> <dd> <p>(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (ordinal &gt;255) when it wasn't expecting one. This warning is by default on for I/O (like print).</p> <p>If this warning does come from I/O, the easiest way to quiet it is simply to add the <code>:utf8</code> layer, <i>e.g.</i>, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>binmode STDOUT, ':utf8'</code></span>. Another way to turn off the warning is to add <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>no warnings 'utf8';</code></span> but that is often closer to cheating. In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark the filehandle with an encoding, see <a href="open.html">open</a> and <a href="perlfunc.html#binmode">"binmode" in perlfunc</a>.</p> <p>If the warning comes from other than I/O, this diagnostic probably indicates that incorrect results are being obtained. You should examine your code to determine how a wide character is getting to an operation that doesn't handle them.</p> </dd> <dt id="Wide-character-(U+%X)-in-%s">
Wide character (U+%X) in %s</dt> <dd> <p>(W locale) While in a single-byte locale (<i>i.e.</i>, a non-UTF-8 one), a multi-byte character was encountered. Perl considers this character to be the specified Unicode code point. Combining non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode is dangerous. Almost certainly some characters will have two different representations. For example, in the ISO 8859-7 (Greek) locale, the code point 0xC3 represents a Capital Gamma. But so also does 0x393. This will make string comparisons unreliable.</p> <p>You likely need to figure out how this multi-byte character got mixed up with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you had a UTF-8 locale, but Perl disagrees).</p> </dd> <dt id="Within-[]-length-'%c'-not-allowed">
Within []-length '%c' not allowed</dt> <dd> <p>(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by <code>[TEMPLATE]</code> only if <code>TEMPLATE</code> always matches the same amount of packed bytes that can be determined from the template alone. This is not possible if it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *-length. Redesign the template.</p> </dd> <dt id='While-trying-to-resolve-method-call-%s-&gt;%s()-can-not-locate-package-"%s"-yet-it-is-mentioned-in-@%s::ISA-(perhaps-you-forgot-to-load-"%s"?)'>
While trying to resolve method call %s-&gt;%s() can not locate package "%s" yet it is mentioned in @%s::ISA (perhaps you forgot to load "%s"?)</dt> <dd> <p>(W syntax) It is possible that the <code>@ISA</code> contains a misspelled or never loaded package name, which can result in perl choosing an unexpected parent class's method to resolve the method call. If this is deliberate you can do something like</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@Missing::Package::ISA = ();</code></pre> <p>to silence the warnings, otherwise you should correct the package name, or ensure that the package is loaded prior to the method call.</p> </dd> <dt id="%s()-with-negative-argument">
%s() with negative argument</dt> <dd> <p>(S misc) Certain operations make no sense with negative arguments. Warning is given and the operation is not done.</p> </dd> <dt id="write()-on-closed-filehandle-%s">

%s "\x%X" does not map to Unicode</dt> <dd> <p>(S utf8) When reading in different encodings, Perl tries to map everything into Unicode characters. The bytes you read in are not legal in this encoding. For example</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">utf8 "\xE4" does not map to Unicode</code></pre> <p>if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</p> </dd> <dt id="'X'-outside-of-string">
'X' outside of string</dt> <dd> <p>(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before the beginning of the string being (un)packed. See <a href="perlfunc.html#pack">"pack" in perlfunc</a>.</p> </dd> <dt id="'x'-outside-of-string-in-unpack">
'x' outside of string in unpack</dt> <dd> <p>(F) You had an unpack template that specified a relative position after the end of the string being unpacked. See <a href="perlfunc.html#pack">"pack" in perlfunc</a>.</p> </dd> <dt id="YOU-HAVEN'T-DISABLED-SET-ID-SCRIPTS-IN-THE-KERNEL-YET!">
YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</dt> <dd> <p>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip about what you want. There is a vulnerability anywhere that you have a set-id script, and to close it you need to remove the set-id bit from the script that you're attempting to run. To actually run the script set-id, your best bet is to put a set-id C wrapper around your script.</p> </dd> <dt id='You-need-to-quote-"%s"'>
You need to quote "%s"</dt> <dd> <p>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name. Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared, which means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want. (If it IS what you want, put an &amp; in front.)</p> </dd> <dt id="Your-random-numbers-are-not-that-random">
Your random numbers are not that random</dt> <dd> <p>(F) When trying to initialize the random seed for hashes, Perl could not get any randomness out of your system. This usually indicates Something Very Wrong.</p> </dd> <dt id="Zero-length-\N{}-in-regex;-marked-by-in-m/%s/">
Zero length \N{} in regex; marked by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> in m/%s/</dt> <dd> <p>(F) Named Unicode character escapes (<code>\N{...}</code>) may return a zero-length sequence. Such an escape was used in an extended character class, i.e. <code>(?[...])</code>, or under <code>use re 'strict'</code>, which is not permitted. Check that the correct escape has been used, and the correct charnames handler is in scope. The <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.</p> </dd> </dl> <h2 id="SEE-ALSO">
