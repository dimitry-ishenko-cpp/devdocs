This trumps other matter such as differing calling conventions because the problem space is so much greater. There are simply more ways to shove data into memory than there are ways to implement a function call.</p> <p>Perl XS' attempt at a solution to this is the concept of typemaps. At an abstract level, a Perl XS typemap is nothing but a recipe for converting from a certain Perl data structure to a certain C data structure and vice versa. Since there can be C types that are sufficiently similar to one another to warrant converting with the same logic, XS typemaps are represented by a unique identifier, henceforth called an <b>XS type</b> in this document. You can then tell the XS compiler that multiple C types are to be mapped with the same XS typemap.</p> <p>In your XS code, when you define an argument with a C type or when you are using a <code>CODE:</code> and an <code>OUTPUT:</code> section together with a C return type of your XSUB, it'll be the typemapping mechanism that makes this easy.</p> <h3 id="Anatomy-of-a-typemap">
Anatomy of a typemap</h3> <p>In more practical terms, the typemap is a collection of code fragments which are used by the <b>xsubpp</b> compiler to map C function parameters and values to Perl values. The typemap file may consist of three sections labelled <code>TYPEMAP</code>, <code>INPUT</code>, and <code>OUTPUT</code>. An unlabelled initial section is assumed to be a <code>TYPEMAP</code> section. The INPUT section tells the compiler how to translate Perl values into variables of certain C types. The OUTPUT section tells the compiler how to translate the values from certain C types into values Perl can understand. The TYPEMAP section tells the compiler which of the INPUT and OUTPUT code fragments should be used to map a given C type to a Perl value. The section labels <code>TYPEMAP</code>, <code>INPUT</code>, or <code>OUTPUT</code> must begin in the first column on a line by themselves, and must be in uppercase.</p> <p>Each type of section can appear an arbitrary number of times and does not have to appear at all. For example, a typemap may commonly lack <code>INPUT</code> and <code>OUTPUT</code> sections if all it needs to do is associate additional C types with core XS types like T_PTROBJ. Lines that start with a hash <code>#</code> are considered comments and ignored in the <code>TYPEMAP</code> section, but are considered significant in <code>INPUT</code> and <code>OUTPUT</code>. Blank lines are generally ignored.</p> <p>Traditionally, typemaps needed to be written to a separate file, conventionally called <code>typemap</code> in a CPAN distribution. With ExtUtils::ParseXS (the XS compiler) version 3.12 or better which comes with perl 5.16, typemaps can also be embedded directly into XS code using a HERE-doc like syntax:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">TYPEMAP: &lt;&lt;HERE
...
HERE</code></pre> <p>where <code>HERE</code> can be replaced by other identifiers like with normal Perl HERE-docs. All details below about the typemap textual format remain valid.</p> <p>The <code>TYPEMAP</code> section should contain one pair of C type and XS type per line as follows. An example from the core typemap file:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">TYPEMAP
# all variants of char* is handled by the T_PV typemap
char *          T_PV
const char *    T_PV
unsigned char * T_PV
...</code></pre> <p>The <code>INPUT</code> and <code>OUTPUT</code> sections have identical formats, that is, each unindented line starts a new in- or output map respectively. A new in- or output map must start with the name of the XS type to map on a line by itself, followed by the code that implements it indented on the following lines. Example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>INPUT
T_PV
  $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
T_PTR
  $var = INT2PTR($type,SvIV($arg))</code></pre> <p>We'll get to the meaning of those Perlish-looking variables in a little bit.</p> <p>Finally, here's an example of the full typemap file for mapping C strings of the <code>char *</code> type to Perl scalars/strings:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>TYPEMAP
char *  T_PV

INPUT
T_PV
  $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)

OUTPUT
T_PV
  sv_setpv((SV*)$arg, $var);</code></pre> <p>Here's a more complicated example: suppose that you wanted <code>struct netconfig</code> to be blessed into the class <code>Net::Config</code>. One way to do this is to use underscores (_) to separate package names, as follows:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>typedef struct netconfig * Net_Config;</code></pre> <p>And then provide a typemap entry <code>T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL</code> that maps underscores to double-colons (::), and declare <code>Net_Config</code> to be of that type:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>TYPEMAP
Net_Config      T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL

INPUT
T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
  if (sv_derived_from($arg, \"${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\")){
    IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg));
    $var = INT2PTR($type, tmp);
  }
  else
    croak(\"$var is not of type ${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\")

OUTPUT
T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
  sv_setref_pv($arg, \"${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\",
               (void*)$var);</code></pre> <p>The INPUT and OUTPUT sections substitute underscores for double-colons on the fly, giving the desired effect. This example demonstrates some of the power and versatility of the typemap facility.</p> <p>The <code>INT2PTR</code> macro (defined in perl.h) casts an integer to a pointer of a given type, taking care of the possible different size of integers and pointers. There are also <code>PTR2IV</code>, <code>PTR2UV</code>, <code>PTR2NV</code> macros, to map the other way, which may be useful in OUTPUT sections.</p> <h3 id="The-Role-of-the-typemap-File-in-Your-Distribution">
The Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution</h3> <p>The default typemap in the <i>lib/ExtUtils</i> directory of the Perl source contains many useful types which can be used by Perl extensions. Some extensions define additional typemaps which they keep in their own directory. These additional typemaps may reference INPUT and OUTPUT maps in the main typemap. The <b>xsubpp</b> compiler will allow the extension's own typemap to override any mappings which are in the default typemap. Instead of using an additional <i>typemap</i> file, typemaps may be embedded verbatim in XS with a heredoc-like syntax. See the documentation on the <code>TYPEMAP:</code> XS keyword.</p> <p>For CPAN distributions, you can assume that the XS types defined by the perl core are already available. Additionally, the core typemap has default XS types for a large number of C types. For example, if you simply return a <code>char *</code> from your XSUB, the core typemap will have this C type associated with the T_PV XS type. That means your C string will be copied into the PV (pointer value) slot of a new scalar that will be returned from your XSUB to Perl.</p> <p>If you're developing a CPAN distribution using XS, you may add your own file called <i>typemap</i> to the distribution. That file may contain typemaps that either map types that are specific to your code or that override the core typemap file's mappings for common C types.</p> <h3 id="Sharing-typemaps-Between-CPAN-Distributions">
Sharing typemaps Between CPAN Distributions</h3> <p>Starting with ExtUtils::ParseXS version 3.13_01 (comes with perl 5.16 and better), it is rather easy to share typemap code between multiple CPAN distributions. The general idea is to share it as a module that offers a certain API and have the dependent modules declare that as a built-time requirement and import the typemap into the XS. An example of such a typemap-sharing module on CPAN is <code>ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic</code>. Two steps to getting that module's typemaps available in your code:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>Declare <code>ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic</code> as a build-time dependency in <code>Makefile.PL</code> (use <code>BUILD_REQUIRES</code>), or in your <code>Build.PL</code> (use <code>build_requires</code>).</p> </li> <li>
<p>Include the following line in the XS section of your XS file: (don't break the line)</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">INCLUDE_COMMAND: $^X -MExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd
                 -e "print embeddable_typemap(q{Basic})"</code></pre> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Writing-typemap-Entries">
Writing typemap Entries</h3> <p>Each INPUT or OUTPUT typemap entry is a double-quoted Perl string that will be evaluated in the presence of certain variables to get the final C code for mapping a certain C type.</p> <p>This means that you can embed Perl code in your typemap (C) code using constructs such as <code>${ perl code that evaluates to scalar reference here }</code>. A common use case is to generate error messages that refer to the true function name even when using the ALIAS XS feature:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>${ $ALIAS ? \q[GvNAME(CvGV(cv))] : \qq[\"$pname\"] }</code></pre> <p>For many typemap examples, refer to the core typemap file that can be found in the perl source tree at <i>lib/ExtUtils/typemap</i>.</p> <p>The Perl variables that are available for interpolation into typemaps are the following:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><i>$var</i> - the name of the input or output variable, eg. RETVAL for return values.</p> </li> <li>
<p><i>$type</i> - the raw C type of the parameter, any <code>:</code> replaced with <code>_</code>. e.g. for a type of <code>Foo::Bar</code>, <i>$type</i> is <code>Foo__Bar</code></p> </li> <li>
<p><i>$ntype</i> - the supplied type with <code>*</code> replaced with <code>Ptr</code>. e.g. for a type of <code>Foo*</code>, <i>$ntype</i> is <code>FooPtr</code></p> </li> <li>
<p><i>$arg</i> - the stack entry, that the parameter is input from or output to, e.g. <code>ST(0)</code></p> </li> <li>
<p><i>$argoff</i> - the argument stack offset of the argument. ie. 0 for the first argument, etc.</p> </li> <li>
<p><i>$pname</i> - the full name of the XSUB, with including the <code>PACKAGE</code> name, with any <code>PREFIX</code> stripped. This is the non-ALIAS name.</p> </li> <li>
<p><i>$Package</i> - the package specified by the most recent <code>PACKAGE</code> keyword.</p> </li> <li>
<p><i>$ALIAS</i> - non-zero if the current XSUB has any aliases declared with <code>ALIAS</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Full-Listing-of-Core-Typemaps">

Here the representation of the data is irrelevant to perl and the bytes themselves are just stored in the SV. It is assumed that the C variable is a pointer (the bytes are copied from that memory location). If the pointer is pointing to something that is represented by 8 bytes then those 8 bytes are stored in the SV (and length() will report a value of 8). This entry is similar to T_OPAQUE.</p> <p>In principle the unpack() command can be used to convert the bytes back to a number (if the underlying type is known to be a number).</p> <p>This entry can be used to store a C structure (the number of bytes to be copied is calculated using the C <code>sizeof</code> function) and can be used as an alternative to T_PTRREF without having to worry about a memory leak (since Perl will clean up the SV).</p> </dd> <dt id="T_OPAQUE">T_OPAQUE</dt> <dd> <p>This can be used to store data from non-pointer types in the string part of an SV. It is similar to T_OPAQUEPTR except that the typemap retrieves the pointer directly rather than assuming it is being supplied. For example, if an integer is imported into Perl using T_OPAQUE rather than T_IV the underlying bytes representing the integer will be stored in the SV but the actual integer value will not be available. i.e. The data is opaque to perl.</p> <p>The data may be retrieved using the <code>unpack</code> function if the underlying type of the byte stream is known.</p> <p>T_OPAQUE supports input and output of simple types. T_OPAQUEPTR can be used to pass these bytes back into C if a pointer is acceptable.</p> </dd> <dt id="Implicit-array">

If the XS return type is given as</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">array(type, nelem)</code></pre> <p>xsubpp will copy the contents of <code>nelem * sizeof(type)</code> bytes from RETVAL to an SV and push it onto the stack. This is only really useful if the number of items to be returned is known at compile time and you don't mind having a string of bytes in your SV. Use T_ARRAY to push a variable number of arguments onto the return stack (they won't be packed as a single string though).</p> <p>This is similar to using T_OPAQUEPTR but can be used to process more than one element.</p> </dd> <dt id="T_PACKED">T_PACKED</dt> <dd> <p>Calls user-supplied functions for conversion. For <code>OUTPUT</code> (XSUB to Perl), a function named <code>XS_pack_$ntype</code> is called with the output Perl scalar and the C variable to convert from. <code>$ntype</code> is the normalized C type that is to be mapped to Perl. Normalized means that all <code>*</code> are replaced by the string <code>Ptr</code>. The return value of the function is ignored.</p> <p>Conversely for <code>INPUT</code> (Perl to XSUB) mapping, the function named <code>XS_unpack_$ntype</code> is called with the input Perl scalar as argument and the return value is cast to the mapped C type and assigned to the output C variable.</p> <p>An example conversion function for a typemapped struct <code>foo_t *</code> might be:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>static void

  /* ... */

  /* mortalize as thy stack is not refcounted */
  sv_setsv(out, sv_2mortal(newRV_noinc((SV*)hash)));

XS_unpack_foo_tPtr(SV *in);</code></pre> <p>Instead of an actual C function that has to fetch the thread context using <code>dTHX</code>, you can define macros of the same name and avoid the overhead.

In fact, the <code>INPUT</code> (Perl to XSUB) typemap is identical, but the <code>OUTPUT</code> typemap passes an additional argument to the <code>XS_pack_$ntype</code> function. This third parameter indicates the number of elements in the output so that the function can handle C arrays sanely. The variable needs to be declared by the user and must have the name <code>count_$ntype</code> where <code>$ntype</code> is the normalized C type name as explained above. The signature of the function would be for the example above and <code>foo_t **</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>static void
XS_pack_foo_tPtrPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in, UV count_foo_tPtrPtr);</code></pre> <p>The type of the third parameter is arbitrary as far as the typemap is concerned.

Since the details are all up to the XS author (the typemap user), there are several solutions, none of which particularly elegant. The most commonly seen solution has been to allocate memory for N+1 pointers and assign <code>NULL</code> to the (N+1)th to facilitate iteration.</p> <p>Alternatively, using a customized typemap for your purposes in the first place is probably preferable.</p> </dd> <dt id="T_DATAUNIT">T_DATAUNIT</dt> <dd> <p>NOT YET</p> </dd> <dt id="T_CALLBACK">T_CALLBACK</dt> <dd> <p>NOT YET</p> </dd> <dt id="T_ARRAY">T_ARRAY</dt> <dd> <p>This is used to convert the perl argument list to a C array and for pushing the contents of a C array onto the perl argument stack.</p> <p>The usual calling signature is</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@out = array_func( @in );</code></pre> <p>Any number of arguments can occur in the list before the array but the input and output arrays must be the last elements in the list.</p> <p>When used to pass a perl list to C the XS writer must provide a function (named after the array type but with 'Ptr' substituted for '*') to allocate the memory required to hold the list. A pointer should be returned. It is up to the XS writer to free the memory on exit from the function. The variable <code>ix_$var</code> is set to the number of elements in the new array.</p> <p>When returning a C array to Perl the XS writer must provide an integer variable called <code>size_$var</code> containing the number of elements in the array. This is used to determine how many elements should be pushed onto the return argument stack. This is not required on input since Perl knows how many arguments are on the stack when the routine is called. Ordinarily this variable would be called <code>size_RETVAL</code>.</p> <p>Additionally, the type of each element is determined from the type of the array. If the array uses type <code>intArray *</code> xsubpp will automatically work out that it contains variables of type <code>int</code> and use that typemap entry to perform the copy of each element.
