Data: Numbers</h2> <h3 id="Why-am-I-getting-long-decimals-(eg,-19.9499999999999)-instead-of-the-numbers-I-should-be-getting-(eg,-19.95)?">
Why am I getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting (eg, 19.95)?</h3> <p>For the long explanation, see David Goldberg's "What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic" (<a href="http://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse320/Documents/FloatingPoint.pdf">http://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse320/Documents/FloatingPoint.pdf</a>).</p> <p>Internally, your computer represents floating-point numbers in binary. Digital (as in powers of two) computers cannot store all numbers exactly. Some real numbers lose precision in the process. This is a problem with how computers store numbers and affects all computer languages, not just Perl.</p> <p><a href="perlnumber.html">perlnumber</a> shows the gory details of number representations and conversions.</p> <p>To limit the number of decimal places in your numbers, you can use the <code>printf</code> or <code>sprintf</code> function. See <a href="perlop.html#Floating-point-Arithmetic">"Floating-point Arithmetic" in perlop</a> for more details.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>printf "%.2f", 10/3;

my $number = sprintf "%.2f", 10/3;</code></pre> <h3 id="Why-is-int()-broken?">
Why is int() broken?</h3> <p>Your <code>int()</code> is most probably working just fine. It's the numbers that aren't quite what you think.</p> <p>First, see the answer to "Why am I getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting (eg, 19.95)?".</p> <p>For example, this</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print int(0.6/0.2-2), "\n";</code></pre> <p>will in most computers print 0, not 1, because even such simple numbers as 0.6 and 0.2 cannot be presented exactly by floating-point numbers. What you think in the above as 'three' is really more like 2.9999999999999995559.</p> <h3 id="Why-isn't-my-octal-data-interpreted-correctly?">
Why isn't my octal data interpreted correctly?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>You're probably trying to convert a string to a number, which Perl only converts as a decimal number. When Perl converts a string to a number, it ignores leading spaces and zeroes, then assumes the rest of the digits are in base 10:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $string = '0644';

print $string + 0;  # prints 644

print $string + 44; # prints 688, certainly not octal!</code></pre> <p>This problem usually involves one of the Perl built-ins that has the same name a Unix command that uses octal numbers as arguments on the command line. In this example, <code>chmod</code> on the command line knows that its first argument is octal because that's what it does:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>%prompt&gt; chmod 644 file</code></pre> <p>If you want to use the same literal digits (644) in Perl, you have to tell Perl to treat them as octal numbers either by prefixing the digits with a <code>0</code> or using <code>oct</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>chmod(     0644, $filename );  # right, has leading zero
chmod( oct(644), $filename );  # also correct</code></pre> <p>The problem comes in when you take your numbers from something that Perl thinks is a string, such as a command line argument in <code>@ARGV</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>chmod( $ARGV[0],      $filename );  # wrong, even if "0644"

chmod( oct($ARGV[0]), $filename );  # correct, treat string as octal</code></pre> <p>You can always check the value you're using by printing it in octal notation to ensure it matches what you think it should be. Print it in octal and decimal format:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>printf "0%o %d", $number, $number;</code></pre> <h3 id="Does-Perl-have-a-round()-function?-What-about-ceil()-and-floor()?-Trig-functions?">
Does Perl have a round() function? What about ceil() and floor()? Trig functions?</h3> <p>Remember that <code>int()</code> merely truncates toward 0. For rounding to a certain number of digits, <code>sprintf()</code> or <code>printf()</code> is usually the easiest route.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>printf("%.3f", 3.1415926535);   # prints 3.142</code></pre> <p>The <a href="posix.html">POSIX</a> module (part of the standard Perl distribution) implements <code>ceil()</code>, <code>floor()</code>, and a number of other mathematical and trigonometric functions.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use POSIX;
my $ceil   = ceil(3.5);   # 4
my $floor  = floor(3.5);  # 3</code></pre> <p>In 5.000 to 5.003 perls, trigonometry was done in the <a href="Math::Complex.html">Math::Complex</a> module. With 5.004, the <a href="Math::Trig.html">Math::Trig</a> module (part of the standard Perl distribution) implements the trigonometric functions. Internally it uses the <a href="Math::Complex.html">Math::Complex</a> module and some functions can break out from the real axis into the complex plane, for example the inverse sine of 2.</p> <p>Rounding in financial applications can have serious implications, and the rounding method used should be specified precisely. In these cases, it probably pays not to trust whichever system of rounding is being used by Perl, but instead to implement the rounding function you need yourself.</p> <p>To see why, notice how you'll still have an issue on half-way-point alternation:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>for (my $i = -5; $i &lt;= 5; $i += 0.5) { printf "%.0f ",$i }

-5 -4 -4 -4 -3 -2 -2 -2 -1 -0 0 0 1 2 2 2 3 4 4 4 5</code></pre> <p>Don't blame Perl. It's the same as in C. IEEE says we have to do this. Perl numbers whose absolute values are integers under 2**31 (on 32-bit machines) will work pretty much like mathematical integers. Other numbers are not guaranteed.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-convert-between-numeric-representations/bases/radixes?">
How do I convert between numeric representations/bases/radixes?</h3> <p>As always with Perl there is more than one way to do it. Below are a few examples of approaches to making common conversions between number representations. This is intended to be representational rather than exhaustive.</p> <p>Some of the examples later in <a href="perlfaq4.html">perlfaq4</a> use the <a href="Bit::Vector.html">Bit::Vector</a> module from CPAN. The reason you might choose <a href="Bit::Vector.html">Bit::Vector</a> over the perl built-in functions is that it works with numbers of ANY size, that it is optimized for speed on some operations, and for at least some programmers the notation might be familiar.</p> <dl> <dt id="How-do-I-convert-hexadecimal-into-decimal">

Why doesn't &amp; work the way I want it to?</h3> <p>The behavior of binary arithmetic operators depends on whether they're used on numbers or strings. The operators treat a string as a series of bits and work with that (the string <code>"3"</code> is the bit pattern <code>00110011</code>). The operators work with the binary form of a number (the number <code>3</code> is treated as the bit pattern <code>00000011</code>).</p> <p>So, saying <code>11 &amp; 3</code> performs the "and" operation on numbers (yielding <code>3</code>). Saying <code>"11" &amp; "3"</code> performs the "and" operation on strings (yielding <code>"1"</code>).</p> <p>Most problems with <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> arise because the programmer thinks they have a number but really it's a string or vice versa. To avoid this, stringify the arguments explicitly (using <code>""</code> or <code>qq()</code>) or convert them to numbers explicitly (using <code>0+$arg</code>). The rest arise because the programmer says:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>if ("\020\020" &amp; "\101\101") {
    # ...
}</code></pre> <p>but a string consisting of two null bytes (the result of <code>"\020\020" &amp; "\101\101"</code>) is not a false value in Perl. You need:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>if ( ("\020\020" &amp; "\101\101") !~ /[^\000]/) {

Don't call <code>srand</code> more than once--you make your numbers less random, rather than more.</p> <p>Computers are good at being predictable and bad at being random (despite appearances caused by bugs in your programs :-).

John von Neumann said, "Anyone who attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is, of course, living in a state of sin."</p> <p>Perl relies on the underlying system for the implementation of <code>rand</code> and <code>srand</code>; on some systems, the generated numbers are not random enough (especially on Windows : see <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=803632">http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=803632</a>). Several CPAN modules in the <code>Math</code> namespace implement better pseudorandom generators; see for example <a href="Math::Random::MT.html">Math::Random::MT</a> ("Mersenne Twister", fast), or <a href="Math::TrulyRandom.html">Math::TrulyRandom</a> (uses the imperfections in the system's timer to generate random numbers, which is rather slow).

How do I get a random number between X and Y?</h3> <p>To get a random number between two values, you can use the <code>rand()</code> built-in to get a random number between 0 and 1. From there, you shift that into the range that you want.</p> <p><code>rand($x)</code> returns a number such that <code>0 &lt;= rand($x) &lt; $x</code>. Thus what you want to have perl figure out is a random number in the range from 0 to the difference between your <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>.</p> <p>That is, to get a number between 10 and 15, inclusive, you want a random number between 0 and 5 that you can then add to 10.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $number = 10 + int rand( 15-10+1 ); # ( 10,11,12,13,14, or 15 )</code></pre> <p>Hence you derive the following simple function to abstract that. It selects a random integer between the two given integers (inclusive). For example: <code>random_int_between(50,120)</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub random_int_between {
    my($min, $max) = @_;

How can I count the number of occurrences of a substring within a string?</h3> <p>There are a number of ways, with varying efficiency. If you want a count of a certain single character (X) within a string, you can use the <code>tr///</code> function like so:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $string = "ThisXlineXhasXsomeXx'sXinXit";
my $count = ($string =~ tr/X//);
print "There are $count X characters in the string";</code></pre> <p>This is fine if you are just looking for a single character. However, if you are trying to count multiple character substrings within a larger string, <code>tr///</code> won't work. What you can do is wrap a while() loop around a global pattern match. For example, let's count negative integers:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $string = "-9 55 48 -2 23 -76 4 14 -44";
my $count = 0;
while ($string =~ /-\d+/g) { $count++ }
print "There are $count negative numbers in the string";</code></pre> <p>Another version uses a global match in list context, then assigns the result to a scalar, producing a count of the number of matches.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $count = () = $string =~ /-\d+/g;</code></pre> <h3 id="How-do-I-capitalize-all-the-words-on-one-line?">

If you answered 5 you're right. Perl words are groups of <code>\w+</code>, but that's not what you want to capitalize. How is Perl supposed to know not to capitalize that <code>s</code> after the apostrophe? You could try a regular expression:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$string =~ s/ (

You can't use <code>split(/,/)</code> because you shouldn't split if the comma is inside quotes. For example, take a data line like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">SAR001,"","Cimetrix, Inc","Bob Smith","CAM",N,8,1,0,7,"Error, Core Dumped"</code></pre> <p>Due to the restriction of the quotes, this is a fairly complex problem.

How do I strip blank space from the beginning/end of a string?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>A substitution can do this for you. For a single line, you want to replace all the leading or trailing whitespace with nothing. You can do that with a pair of substitutions:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>s/^\s+//;
s/\s+$//;</code></pre> <p>You can also write that as a single substitution, although it turns out the combined statement is slower than the separate ones. That might not matter to you, though:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>s/^\s+|\s+$//g;</code></pre> <p>In this regular expression, the alternation matches either at the beginning or the end of the string since the anchors have a lower precedence than the alternation. With the <code>/g</code> flag, the substitution makes all possible matches, so it gets both. Remember, the trailing newline matches the <code>\s+</code>, and the <code>$</code> anchor can match to the absolute end of the string, so the newline disappears too. Just add the newline to the output, which has the added benefit of preserving "blank" (consisting entirely of whitespace) lines which the <code>^\s+</code> would remove all by itself:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>while( &lt;&gt; ) {
    s/^\s+|\s+$//g;
    print "$_\n";
}</code></pre> <p>For a multi-line string, you can apply the regular expression to each logical line in the string by adding the <code>/m</code> flag (for "multi-line"). With the <code>/m</code> flag, the <code>$</code> matches <i>before</i> an embedded newline, so it doesn't remove it. This pattern still removes the newline at the end of the string:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$string =~ s/^\s+|\s+$//gm;</code></pre> <p>Remember that lines consisting entirely of whitespace will disappear, since the first part of the alternation can match the entire string and replace it with nothing. If you need to keep embedded blank lines, you have to do a little more work. Instead of matching any whitespace (since that includes a newline), just match the other whitespace:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$string =~ s/^[\t\f ]+|[\t\f ]+$//mg;</code></pre> <h3 id="How-do-I-pad-a-string-with-blanks-or-pad-a-number-with-zeroes?">
How do I pad a string with blanks or pad a number with zeroes?</h3> <p>In the following examples, <code>$pad_len</code> is the length to which you wish to pad the string, <code>$text</code> or <code>$num</code> contains the string to be padded, and <code>$pad_char</code> contains the padding character. You can use a single character string constant instead of the <code>$pad_char</code> variable if you know what it is in advance. And in the same way you can use an integer in place of <code>$pad_len</code> if you know the pad length in advance.</p> <p>The simplest method uses the <code>sprintf</code> function. It can pad on the left or right with blanks and on the left with zeroes and it will not truncate the result.

You might even be able to get the job done with <code>sprintf</code> or <code>printf</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $string = sprintf 'Say hello to %s and %s', $foo, $bar;</code></pre> <p>However, for the one-off simple case where I don't want to pull out a full templating system, I'll use a string that has two Perl scalar variables in it. In this example, I want to expand <code>$foo</code> and <code>$bar</code> to their variable's values:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $foo = 'Fred';
my $bar = 'Barney';
$string = 'Say hello to $foo and $bar';</code></pre> <p>One way I can do this involves the substitution operator and a double <code>/e</code> flag. The first <code>/e</code> evaluates <code>$1</code> on the replacement side and turns it into <code>$foo</code>. The second /e starts with <code>$foo</code> and replaces it with its value. <code>$foo</code>, then, turns into 'Fred', and that's finally what's left in the string:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$string =~ s/(\$\w+)/$1/eeg; # 'Say hello to Fred and Barney'</code></pre> <p>The <code>/e</code> will also silently ignore violations of strict, replacing undefined variable names with the empty string. Since I'm using the <code>/e</code> flag (twice even!), I have all of the same security problems I have with <code>eval</code> in its string form. If there's something odd in <code>$foo</code>, perhaps something like <code>@{[ system "rm -rf /" ]}</code>, then I could get myself in trouble.</p> <p>To get around the security problem, I could also pull the values from a hash instead of evaluating variable names. Using a single <code>/e</code>, I can check the hash to ensure the value exists, and if it doesn't, I can replace the missing value with a marker, in this case <code>???</code> to signal that I missed something:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $string = 'This has $foo and $bar';

my %Replacements = (
    foo  =&gt; 'Fred',
    );

# $string =~ s/\$(\w+)/$Replacements{$1}/g;
$string =~ s/\$(\w+)/
    exists $Replacements{$1} ? $Replacements{$1} : '???'

What is the difference between a list and an array?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>A list is a fixed collection of scalars. An array is a variable that holds a variable collection of scalars. An array can supply its collection for list operations, so list operations also work on arrays:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code># slices
( 'dog', 'cat', 'bird' )[2,3];
@animals[2,3];

# iteration
foreach ( qw( dog cat bird ) ) { ... }
foreach ( @animals ) { ... }

my @three = grep { length == 3 } qw( dog cat bird );
my @three = grep { length == 3 } @animals;

# supply an argument list
wash_animals( qw( dog cat bird ) );
wash_animals( @animals );</code></pre> <p>Array operations, which change the scalars, rearrange them, or add or subtract some scalars, only work on arrays. These can't work on a list, which is fixed. Array operations include <code>shift</code>, <code>unshift</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, and <code>splice</code>.</p> <p>An array can also change its length:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$#animals = 1;  # truncate to two elements
$#animals = 10000; # pre-extend to 10,001 elements</code></pre> <p>You can change an array element, but you can't change a list element:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$animals[0] = 'Rottweiler';
qw( dog cat bird )[0] = 'Rottweiler'; # syntax error!

foreach ( @animals ) {
    s/^d/fr/;  # works fine
}

foreach ( qw( dog cat bird ) ) {
    s/^d/fr/;  # Error! Modification of read only value!
}</code></pre> <p>However, if the list element is itself a variable, it appears that you can change a list element. However, the list element is the variable, not the data. You're not changing the list element, but something the list element refers to. The list element itself doesn't change: it's still the same variable.</p> <p>You also have to be careful about context. You can assign an array to a scalar to get the number of elements in the array. This only works for arrays, though:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $count = @animals;  # only works with arrays</code></pre> <p>If you try to do the same thing with what you think is a list, you get a quite different result. Although it looks like you have a list on the righthand side, Perl actually sees a bunch of scalars separated by a comma:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $scalar = ( 'dog', 'cat', 'bird' );  # $scalar gets bird</code></pre> <p>Since you're assigning to a scalar, the righthand side is in scalar context. The comma operator (yes, it's an operator!) in scalar context evaluates its lefthand side, throws away the result, and evaluates it's righthand side and returns the result. In effect, that list-lookalike assigns to <code>$scalar</code> it's rightmost value. Many people mess this up because they choose a list-lookalike whose last element is also the count they expect:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $scalar = ( 1, 2, 3 );  # $scalar gets 3, accidentally</code></pre> <h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-$array[1]-and-@array[1]?">
What is the difference between $array[1] and @array[1]?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>The difference is the sigil, that special character in front of the array name. The <code>$</code> sigil means "exactly one item", while the <code>@</code> sigil means "zero or more items". The <code>$</code> gets you a single scalar, while the <code>@</code> gets you a list.</p> <p>The confusion arises because people incorrectly assume that the sigil denotes the variable type.</p> <p>The <code>$array[1]</code> is a single-element access to the array. It's going to return the item in index 1 (or undef if there is no item there). If you intend to get exactly one element from the array, this is the form you should use.</p> <p>The <code>@array[1]</code> is an array slice, although it has only one index. You can pull out multiple elements simultaneously by specifying additional indices as a list, like <code>@array[1,4,3,0]</code>.</p> <p>Using a slice on the lefthand side of the assignment supplies list context to the righthand side. This can lead to unexpected results. For instance, if you want to read a single line from a filehandle, assigning to a scalar value is fine:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$array[1] = &lt;STDIN&gt;;</code></pre> <p>However, in list context, the line input operator returns all of the lines as a list. The first line goes into <code>@array[1]</code> and the rest of the lines mysteriously disappear:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@array[1] = &lt;STDIN&gt;;  # most likely not what you want</code></pre> <p>Either the <code>use warnings</code> pragma or the <b>-w</b> flag will warn you when you use an array slice with a single index.</p> <h3 id="How-can-I-remove-duplicate-elements-from-a-list-or-array?">
How can I remove duplicate elements from a list or array?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>Use a hash. When you think the words "unique" or "duplicated", think "hash keys".</p> <p>If you don't care about the order of the elements, you could just create the hash then extract the keys. It's not important how you create that hash: just that you use <code>keys</code> to get the unique elements.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my %hash   = map { $_, 1 } @array;
# or a hash slice: @hash{ @array } = ();
# or a foreach: $hash{$_} = 1 foreach ( @array );

my @unique = keys %hash;</code></pre> <p>If you want to use a module, try the <code>uniq</code> function from <a href="List::MoreUtils.html">List::MoreUtils</a>. In list context it returns the unique elements, preserving their order in the list. In scalar context, it returns the number of unique elements.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use List::MoreUtils qw(uniq);

my @unique = uniq( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7 ); # 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
my $unique = uniq( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7 ); # 7</code></pre> <p>You can also go through each element and skip the ones you've seen before. Use a hash to keep track. The first time the loop sees an element, that element has no key in <code>%Seen</code>. The <code>next</code> statement creates the key and immediately uses its value, which is <code>undef</code>, so the loop continues to the <code>push</code> and increments the value for that key. The next time the loop sees that same element, its key exists in the hash <i>and</i> the value for that key is true (since it's not 0 or <code>undef</code>), so the next skips that iteration and the loop goes to the next element.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @unique = ();
my %seen   = ();

foreach my $elem ( @array ) {
    next if $seen{ $elem }++;
    push @unique, $elem;
}</code></pre> <p>You can write this more briefly using a grep, which does the same thing.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my %seen = ();
my @unique = grep { ! $seen{ $_ }++ } @array;</code></pre> <h3 id="How-can-I-tell-whether-a-certain-element-is-contained-in-a-list-or-array?">
How can I tell whether a certain element is contained in a list or array?</h3> <p>(portions of this answer contributed by Anno Siegel and brian d foy)</p> <p>Hearing the word "in" is an <i>in</i>dication that you probably should have used a hash, not a list or array, to store your data. Hashes are designed to answer this question quickly and efficiently. Arrays aren't.</p> <p>That being said, there are several ways to approach this. If you are going to make this query many times over arbitrary string values, the fastest way is probably to invert the original array and maintain a hash whose keys are the first array's values:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @blues = qw/azure cerulean teal turquoise lapis-lazuli/;
my %is_blue = ();
for (@blues) { $is_blue{$_} = 1 }</code></pre> <p>Now you can check whether <code>$is_blue{$some_color}</code>. It might have been a good idea to keep the blues all in a hash in the first place.</p> <p>If the values are all small integers, you could use a simple indexed array. This kind of an array will take up less space:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @primes = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31);
my @is_tiny_prime = ();
for (@primes) { $is_tiny_prime[$_] = 1 }
# or simply  @istiny_prime[@primes] = (1) x @primes;</code></pre> <p>Now you check whether $is_tiny_prime[$some_number].</p> <p>If the values in question are integers instead of strings, you can save quite a lot of space by using bit strings instead:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @articles = ( 1..10, 150..2000, 2017 );
undef $read;
for (@articles) { vec($read,$_,1) = 1 }</code></pre> <p>Now check whether <code>vec($read,$n,1)</code> is true for some <code>$n</code>.</p> <p>These methods guarantee fast individual tests but require a re-organization of the original list or array. They only pay off if you have to test multiple values against the same array.</p> <p>If you are testing only once, the standard module <a href="List::Util.html">List::Util</a> exports the function <code>any</code> for this purpose. It works by stopping once it finds the element. It's written in C for speed, and its Perl equivalent looks like this subroutine:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub any (&amp;@) {
    my $code = shift;
    foreach (@_) {
        return 1 if $code-&gt;();
    }
    return 0;
}</code></pre> <p>If speed is of little concern, the common idiom uses grep in scalar context (which returns the number of items that passed its condition) to traverse the entire list. This does have the benefit of telling you how many matches it found, though.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $is_there = grep $_ eq $whatever, @array;</code></pre> <p>If you want to actually extract the matching elements, simply use grep in list context.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @matches = grep $_ eq $whatever, @array;</code></pre> <h3 id="How-do-I-compute-the-difference-of-two-arrays?-How-do-I-compute-the-intersection-of-two-arrays?">

my %count = ();
foreach my $element (@array1, @array2) { $count{$element}++ }
foreach my $element (keys %count) {
    push @union, $element;
    push @{ $count{$element} &gt; 1 ? \@intersection : \@difference }, $element;
}</code></pre> <p>Note that this is the <i>symmetric difference</i>, that is, all elements in either A or in B but not in both. Think of it as an xor operation.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-test-whether-two-arrays-or-hashes-are-equal?">

        return 0 if $first-&gt;[$i] ne $second-&gt;[$i];
    }
    return 1;
}</code></pre> <p>For multilevel structures, you may wish to use an approach more like this one. It uses the CPAN module <a href="freezethaw.html">FreezeThaw</a>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use FreezeThaw qw(cmpStr);
my @a = my @b = ( "this", "that", [ "more", "stuff" ] );

printf "a and b contain %s arrays\n",
    cmpStr(\@a, \@b) == 0
    ? "the same"
    : "different";</code></pre> <p>This approach also works for comparing hashes. Here we'll demonstrate two different answers:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use FreezeThaw qw(cmpStr cmpStrHard);

my %a = my %b = ( "this" =&gt; "that", "extra" =&gt; [ "more", "stuff" ] );

cmpStr(\%a, \%b) == 0 ? "the same" : "different";

printf "a and b contain %s hashes\n",
cmpStrHard(\%a, \%b) == 0 ? "the same" : "different";</code></pre> <p>The first reports that both those the hashes contain the same data, while the second reports that they do not.

How do I handle linked lists?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>Perl's arrays do not have a fixed size, so you don't need linked lists if you just want to add or remove items. You can use array operations such as <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>unshift</code>, or <code>splice</code> to do that.</p> <p>Sometimes, however, linked lists can be useful in situations where you want to "shard" an array so you have many small arrays instead of a single big array.

How do I process an entire hash?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>There are a couple of ways that you can process an entire hash. You can get a list of keys, then go through each key, or grab a one key-value pair at a time.</p> <p>To go through all of the keys, use the <code>keys</code> function. This extracts all of the keys of the hash and gives them back to you as a list. You can then get the value through the particular key you're processing:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>foreach my $key ( keys %hash ) {
    my $value = $hash{$key}
    ...
}</code></pre> <p>Once you have the list of keys, you can process that list before you process the hash elements. For instance, you can sort the keys so you can process them in lexical order:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>foreach my $key ( sort keys %hash ) {
    my $value = $hash{$key}
    ...
}</code></pre> <p>Or, you might want to only process some of the items. If you only want to deal with the keys that start with <code>text:</code>, you can select just those using <code>grep</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>foreach my $key ( grep /^text:/, keys %hash ) {
    my $value = $hash{$key}
    ...
}</code></pre> <p>If the hash is very large, you might not want to create a long list of keys. To save some memory, you can grab one key-value pair at a time using <code>each()</code>, which returns a pair you haven't seen yet:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>while( my( $key, $value ) = each( %hash ) ) {
    ...
}</code></pre> <p>The <code>each</code> operator returns the pairs in apparently random order, so if ordering matters to you, you'll have to stick with the <code>keys</code> method.</p> <p>The <code>each()</code> operator can be a bit tricky though. You can't add or delete keys of the hash while you're using it without possibly skipping or re-processing some pairs after Perl internally rehashes all of the elements. Additionally, a hash has only one iterator, so if you mix <code>keys</code>, <code>values</code>, or <code>each</code> on the same hash, you risk resetting the iterator and messing up your processing. See the <code>each</code> entry in <a href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> for more details.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-merge-two-hashes?">
How do I merge two hashes? </h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>Before you decide to merge two hashes, you have to decide what to do if both hashes contain keys that are the same and if you want to leave the original hashes as they were.</p> <p>If you want to preserve the original hashes, copy one hash (<code>%hash1</code>) to a new hash (<code>%new_hash</code>), then add the keys from the other hash (<code>%hash2</code> to the new hash. Checking that the key already exists in <code>%new_hash</code> gives you a chance to decide what to do with the duplicates:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my %new_hash = %hash1; # make a copy; leave %hash1 alone

foreach my $key2 ( keys %hash2 ) {
    if( exists $new_hash{$key2} ) {
        warn "Key [$key2] is in both hashes!";
        # handle the duplicate (perhaps only warning)
        ...
        next;
    }
    else {
        $new_hash{$key2} = $hash2{$key2};
    }
}</code></pre> <p>If you don't want to create a new hash, you can still use this looping technique; just change the <code>%new_hash</code> to <code>%hash1</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>foreach my $key2 ( keys %hash2 ) {
    if( exists $hash1{$key2} ) {
        warn "Key [$key2] is in both hashes!";
        # handle the duplicate (perhaps only warning)
        ...
        next;
    }
    else {
        $hash1{$key2} = $hash2{$key2};
    }
  }</code></pre> <p>If you don't care that one hash overwrites keys and values from the other, you could just use a hash slice to add one hash to another. In this case, values from <code>%hash2</code> replace values from <code>%hash1</code> when they have keys in common:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@hash1{ keys %hash2 } = values %hash2;</code></pre> <h3 id="What-happens-if-I-add-or-remove-keys-from-a-hash-while-iterating-over-it?">
What happens if I add or remove keys from a hash while iterating over it?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>The easy answer is "Don't do that!"</p> <p>If you iterate through the hash with each(), you can delete the key most recently returned without worrying about it. If you delete or add other keys, the iterator may skip or double up on them since perl may rearrange the hash table. See the entry for <code>each()</code> in <a href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a>.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-look-up-a-hash-element-by-value?">
How do I look up a hash element by value?</h3> <p>Create a reverse hash:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my %by_value = reverse %by_key;
my $key = $by_value{$value};</code></pre> <p>That's not particularly efficient. It would be more space-efficient to use:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>while (my ($key, $value) = each %by_key) {
    $by_value{$value} = $key;
}</code></pre> <p>If your hash could have repeated values, the methods above will only find one of the associated keys. This may or may not worry you. If it does worry you, you can always reverse the hash into a hash of arrays instead:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>while (my ($key, $value) = each %by_key) {
     push @{$key_list_by_value{$value}}, $key;
}</code></pre> <h3 id="How-can-I-know-how-many-entries-are-in-a-hash?">
How can I know how many entries are in a hash?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>This is very similar to "How do I process an entire hash?", also in <a href="perlfaq4.html">perlfaq4</a>, but a bit simpler in the common cases.</p> <p>You can use the <code>keys()</code> built-in function in scalar context to find out have many entries you have in a hash:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $key_count = keys %hash; # must be scalar context!</code></pre> <p>If you want to find out how many entries have a defined value, that's a bit different. You have to check each value. A <code>grep</code> is handy:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $defined_value_count = grep { defined } values %hash;</code></pre> <p>You can use that same structure to count the entries any way that you like. If you want the count of the keys with vowels in them, you just test for that instead:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $vowel_count = grep { /[aeiou]/ } keys %hash;</code></pre> <p>The <code>grep</code> in scalar context returns the count. If you want the list of matching items, just use it in list context instead:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @defined_values = grep { defined } values %hash;</code></pre> <p>The <code>keys()</code> function also resets the iterator, which means that you may see strange results if you use this between uses of other hash operators such as <code>each()</code>.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-sort-a-hash-(optionally-by-value-instead-of-key)?">
How do I sort a hash (optionally by value instead of key)?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>To sort a hash, start with the keys. In this example, we give the list of keys to the sort function which then compares them ASCIIbetically (which might be affected by your locale settings). The output list has the keys in ASCIIbetical order. Once we have the keys, we can go through them to create a report which lists the keys in ASCIIbetical order.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @keys = sort { $a cmp $b } keys %hash;

foreach my $key ( @keys ) {
    printf "%-20s %6d\n", $key, $hash{$key};
}</code></pre> <p>We could get more fancy in the <code>sort()</code> block though. Instead of comparing the keys, we can compute a value with them and use that value as the comparison.</p> <p>For instance, to make our report order case-insensitive, we use <code>lc</code> to lowercase the keys before comparing them:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @keys = sort { lc $a cmp lc $b } keys %hash;</code></pre> <p>Note: if the computation is expensive or the hash has many elements, you may want to look at the Schwartzian Transform to cache the computation results.</p> <p>If we want to sort by the hash value instead, we use the hash key to look it up. We still get out a list of keys, but this time they are ordered by their value.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @keys = sort { $hash{$a} &lt;=&gt; $hash{$b} } keys %hash;</code></pre> <p>From there we can get more complex. If the hash values are the same, we can provide a secondary sort on the hash key.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @keys = sort {
    $hash{$a} &lt;=&gt; $hash{$b}
        or
    "\L$a" cmp "\L$b"
} keys %hash;</code></pre> <h3 id="How-can-I-always-keep-my-hash-sorted?">
How can I always keep my hash sorted? </h3> <p>You can look into using the <code>DB_File</code> module and <code>tie()</code> using the <code>$DB_BTREE</code> hash bindings as documented in <a href="db_file.html#In-Memory-Databases">"In Memory Databases" in DB_File</a>. The <a href="Tie::IxHash.html">Tie::IxHash</a> module from CPAN might also be instructive. Although this does keep your hash sorted, you might not like the slowdown you suffer from the tie interface.

What's the difference between "delete" and "undef" with hashes?</h3> <p>Hashes contain pairs of scalars: the first is the key, the second is the value. The key will be coerced to a string, although the value can be any kind of scalar: string, number, or reference. If a key <code>$key</code> is present in %hash, <code>exists($hash{$key})</code> will return true. The value for a given key can be <code>undef</code>, in which case <code>$hash{$key}</code> will be <code>undef</code> while <code>exists $hash{$key}</code> will return true.

Why does passing a subroutine an undefined element in a hash create it?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>Are you using a really old version of Perl?</p> <p>Normally, accessing a hash key's value for a nonexistent key will <i>not</i> create the key.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my %hash  = ();
my $value = $hash{ 'foo' };
print "This won't print\n" if exists $hash{ 'foo' };</code></pre> <p>Passing <code>$hash{ 'foo' }</code> to a subroutine used to be a special case, though. Since you could assign directly to <code>$_[0]</code>, Perl had to be ready to make that assignment so it created the hash key ahead of time:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my_sub( $hash{ 'foo' } );
print "This will print before 5.004\n" if exists $hash{ 'foo' };

sub my_sub {
    # $_[0] = 'bar'; # create hash key in case you do this
    1;
}</code></pre> <p>Since Perl 5.004, however, this situation is a special case and Perl creates the hash key only when you make the assignment:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my_sub( $hash{ 'foo' } );
print "This will print, even after 5.004\n" if exists $hash{ 'foo' };

sub my_sub {
    $_[0] = 'bar';
}</code></pre> <p>However, if you want the old behavior (and think carefully about that because it's a weird side effect), you can pass a hash slice instead.

How can I use a reference as a hash key?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy and Ben Morrow)</p> <p>Hash keys are strings, so you can't really use a reference as the key. When you try to do that, perl turns the reference into its stringified form (for instance, <code>HASH(0xDEADBEEF)</code>). From there you can't get back the reference from the stringified form, at least without doing some extra work on your own.</p> <p>Remember that the entry in the hash will still be there even if the referenced variable goes out of scope, and that it is entirely possible for Perl to subsequently allocate a different variable at the same address. This will mean a new variable might accidentally be associated with the value for an old.</p> <p>If you have Perl 5.10 or later, and you just want to store a value against the reference for lookup later, you can use the core Hash::Util::Fieldhash module. This will also handle renaming the keys if you use multiple threads (which causes all variables to be reallocated at new addresses, changing their stringification), and garbage-collecting the entries when the referenced variable goes out of scope.</p> <p>If you actually need to be able to get a real reference back from each hash entry, you can use the Tie::RefHash module, which does the required work for you.</p> <h3 id="How-can-I-check-if-a-key-exists-in-a-multilevel-hash?">
How can I check if a key exists in a multilevel hash?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>The trick to this problem is avoiding accidental autovivification. If you want to check three keys deep, you might naïvely try this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my %hash;
if( exists $hash{key1}{key2}{key3} ) {
    ...;
}</code></pre> <p>Even though you started with a completely empty hash, after that call to <code>exists</code> you've created the structure you needed to check for <code>key3</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>%hash = (
          'key1' =&gt; {
                      'key2' =&gt; {}

        );</code></pre> <p>That's autovivification. You can get around this in a few ways. The easiest way is to just turn it off. The lexical <code>autovivification</code> pragma is available on CPAN. Now you don't add to the hash:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>{
    no autovivification;
    my %hash;
    if( exists $hash{key1}{key2}{key3} ) {
        ...;
    }
}</code></pre> <p>The <a href="Data::Diver.html">Data::Diver</a> module on CPAN can do it for you too. Its <code>Dive</code> subroutine can tell you not only if the keys exist but also get the value:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Data::Diver qw(Dive);

my @exists = Dive( \%hash, qw(key1 key2 key3) );

store(\%hash, "filename");

# later on...
$href = retrieve("filename");        # by ref
%hash = %{ retrieve("filename") };   # direct to hash</code></pre> <h3 id="How-do-I-print-out-or-copy-a-recursive-data-structure?">
How do I print out or copy a recursive data structure?</h3> <p>The <a href="Data::Dumper.html">Data::Dumper</a> module on CPAN (or the 5.005 release of Perl) is great for printing out data structures. The <a href="storable.html">Storable</a> module on CPAN (or the 5.8 release of Perl), provides a function called <code>dclone</code> that recursively copies its argument.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Storable qw(dclone);
$r2 = dclone($r1);</code></pre> <p>Where <code>$r1</code> can be a reference to any kind of data structure you'd like. It will be deeply copied. Because <code>dclone</code> takes and returns references, you'd have to add extra punctuation if you had a hash of arrays that you wanted to copy.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>%newhash = %{ dclone(\%oldhash) };</code></pre> <h3 id="How-do-I-define-methods-for-every-class/object?">
How do I define methods for every class/object?</h3> <p>(contributed by Ben Morrow)</p> <p>You can use the <code>UNIVERSAL</code> class (see <a href="universal.html">UNIVERSAL</a>). However, please be very careful to consider the consequences of doing this: adding methods to every object is very likely to have unintended consequences. If possible, it would be better to have all your object inherit from some common base class, or to use an object system like Moose that supports roles.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-verify-a-credit-card-checksum?">
How do I verify a credit card checksum?</h3> <p>Get the <a href="Business::CreditCard.html">Business::CreditCard</a> module from CPAN.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-pack-arrays-of-doubles-or-floats-for-XS-code?">
How do I pack arrays of doubles or floats for XS code?</h3> <p>The arrays.h/arrays.c code in the <a href="pgplot.html">PGPLOT</a> module on CPAN does just this. If you're doing a lot of float or double processing, consider using the <a href="pdl.html">PDL</a> module from CPAN instead--it makes number-crunching easy.</p> <p>See <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/PGPLOT">https://metacpan.org/release/PGPLOT</a> for the code.</p> <h2 id="AUTHOR-AND-COPYRIGHT">
