NOT TESTING! Anything but testing! Beat me, whip me, send me to Detroit, but don't make me write tests!</i></p> <p><i>*sob*</i></p> <p><i>Besides, I don't know how to write the damned things.</i></p> <p>Is this you? Is writing tests right up there with writing documentation and having your fingernails pulled out? Did you open up a test and read</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">######## We start with some black magic</code></pre> <p>and decide that's quite enough for you?</p> <p>It's ok. That's all gone now. We've done all the black magic for you. And here are the tricks...</p> <h3 id="Nuts-and-bolts-of-testing.">
Nuts and bolts of testing.</h3> <p>Here's the most basic test program.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

print "1..1\n";

print 1 + 1 == 2 ? "ok 1\n" : "not ok 1\n";</code></pre> <p>Because 1 + 1 is 2, it prints:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">1..1
ok 1</code></pre> <p>What this says is: <code>1..1</code> "I'm going to run one test." [1] <code>ok 1</code> "The first test passed". And that's about all magic there is to testing. Your basic unit of testing is the <i>ok</i>. For each thing you test, an <code>ok</code> is printed. Simple. <a href="Test::Harness.html">Test::Harness</a> interprets your test results to determine if you succeeded or failed (more on that later).</p> <p>Writing all these print statements rapidly gets tedious. Fortunately, there's <a href="Test::Simple.html">Test::Simple</a>. It has one function, <code>ok()</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 1;

ok( 1 + 1 == 2 );</code></pre> <p>That does the same thing as the previous code. <code>ok()</code> is the backbone of Perl testing, and we'll be using it instead of roll-your-own from here on. If <code>ok()</code> gets a true value, the test passes. False, it fails.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 2;
ok( 1 + 1 == 2 );
ok( 2 + 2 == 5 );</code></pre> <p>From that comes:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">1..2
ok 1
not ok 2
#     Failed test (test.pl at line 5)
# Looks like you failed 1 tests of 2.</code></pre> <p><code>1..2</code> "I'm going to run two tests." This number is a <i>plan</i>. It helps to ensure your test program ran all the way through and didn't die or skip some tests. <code>ok 1</code> "The first test passed." <code>not ok 2</code> "The second test failed". Test::Simple helpfully prints out some extra commentary about your tests.</p> <p>It's not scary. Come, hold my hand. We're going to give an example of testing a module. For our example, we'll be testing a date library, <a href="Date::ICal.html">Date::ICal</a>. It's on CPAN, so download a copy and follow along. [2]</p> <h3 id="Where-to-start?">
Where to start?</h3> <p>This is the hardest part of testing, where do you start? People often get overwhelmed at the apparent enormity of the task of testing a whole module. The best place to start is at the beginning. <a href="Date::ICal.html">Date::ICal</a> is an object-oriented module, and that means you start by making an object. Test <code>new()</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

# assume these two lines are in all subsequent examples
use strict;
use warnings;

use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 2;

use Date::ICal;

my $ical = Date::ICal-&gt;new;         # create an object
ok( defined $ical );                # check that we got something
ok( $ical-&gt;isa('Date::ICal') );     # and it's the right class</code></pre> <p>Run that and you should get:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">1..2
ok 1
ok 2</code></pre> <p>Congratulations! You've written your first useful test.</p> <h3 id="Names">Names</h3> <p>That output isn't terribly descriptive, is it? When you have two tests you can figure out which one is #2, but what if you have 102 tests?</p> <p>Each test can be given a little descriptive name as the second argument to <code>ok()</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 2;

ok( defined $ical,              'new() returned something' );
ok( $ical-&gt;isa('Date::ICal'),   "  and it's the right class" );</code></pre> <p>Now you'll see:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">1..2
ok 1 - new() returned something
ok 2 -   and it's the right class</code></pre> <h3 id="Test-the-manual">
Test the manual</h3> <p>The simplest way to build up a decent testing suite is to just test what the manual says it does. [3] Let's pull something out of the <a href="Date::ICal.html#SYNOPSIS">"SYNOPSIS" in Date::ICal</a> and test that all its bits work.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

ok 8 -   year()
# Looks like you failed 1 tests of 8.</code></pre> <p>Whoops, a failure! [4] <a href="Test::Simple.html">Test::Simple</a> helpfully lets us know on what line the failure occurred, but not much else. We were supposed to get 17, but we didn't. What did we get?? Dunno. You could re-run the test in the debugger or throw in some print statements to find out.</p> <p>Instead, switch from <a href="Test::Simple.html">Test::Simple</a> to <a href="Test::More.html">Test::More</a>. <a href="Test::More.html">Test::More</a> does everything <a href="Test::Simple.html">Test::Simple</a> does, and more! In fact, <a href="Test::More.html">Test::More</a> does things <i>exactly</i> the way <a href="Test::Simple.html">Test::Simple</a> does. You can literally swap <a href="Test::Simple.html">Test::Simple</a> out and put <a href="Test::More.html">Test::More</a> in its place. That's just what we're going to do.</p> <p><a href="Test::More.html">Test::More</a> does more than <a href="Test::Simple.html">Test::Simple</a>. The most important difference at this point is it provides more informative ways to say "ok". Although you can write almost any test with a generic <code>ok()</code>, it can't tell you what went wrong. The <code>is()</code> function lets us declare that something is supposed to be the same as something else:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::More tests =&gt; 8;

use Date::ICal;

$ical = Date::ICal-&gt;new( year =&gt; 1964, month =&gt; 10, day =&gt; 16,
                         hour =&gt; 16,   min   =&gt; 12, sec =&gt; 47,
                         tz   =&gt; '0530' );

is( $ical-&gt;day,     17,       '  day()'   );
is( $ical-&gt;month,   10,       '  month()' );
is( $ical-&gt;year,    1964,     '  year()'  );</code></pre> <p>"Is <code>$ical-&gt;sec</code> 47?" "Is <code>$ical-&gt;min</code> 12?" With <code>is()</code> in place, you get more information:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">1..8

ok 2 -   and it's the right class
ok 3 -   sec()
ok 4 -   min()

#     Failed test (- at line 16)
#          got: '16'
#     expected: '17'
ok 7 -   month()
ok 8 -   year()
# Looks like you failed 1 tests of 8.</code></pre> <p>Aha. <code>$ical-&gt;day</code> returned 16, but we expected 17. A quick check shows that the code is working fine, we made a mistake when writing the tests. Change it to:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>is( $ical-&gt;day,     16,       '  day()'   );</code></pre> <p>... and everything works.</p> <p>Any time you're doing a "this equals that" sort of test, use <code>is()</code>. It even works on arrays. The test is always in scalar context, so you can test how many elements are in an array this way. [5]</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>is( @foo, 5, 'foo has 5 elements' );</code></pre> <h3 id="Sometimes-the-tests-are-wrong">
Sometimes the tests are wrong</h3> <p>This brings up a very important lesson. Code has bugs. Tests are code. Ergo, tests have bugs. A failing test could mean a bug in the code, but don't discount the possibility that the test is wrong.</p> <p>On the flip side, don't be tempted to prematurely declare a test incorrect just because you're having trouble finding the bug. Invalidating a test isn't something to be taken lightly, and don't use it as a cop out to avoid work.</p> <h3 id="Testing-lots-of-values">
Testing lots of values</h3> <p>We're going to be wanting to test a lot of dates here, trying to trick the code with lots of different edge cases. Does it work before 1970? After 2038? Before 1904? Do years after 10,000 give it trouble? Does it get leap years right? We could keep repeating the code above, or we could set up a little try/expect loop.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::More tests =&gt; 32;
use Date::ICal;

my %ICal_Dates = (
        # An ICal string     And the year, month, day
        #                    hour, minute and second we expect.
        '19971024T120000' =&gt;    # from the docs.
                            [ 1997, 10, 24, 12,  0,  0 ],
        '20390123T232832' =&gt;    # after the Unix epoch
                            [ 2039,  1, 23, 23, 28, 32 ],

    my $ical = Date::ICal-&gt;new( ical =&gt; $ical_str );

    ok( defined $ical,            "new(ical =&gt; '$ical_str')" );

    is( $ical-&gt;sec,     $expect-&gt;[5],     '  sec()'   );
}</code></pre> <p>Now we can test bunches of dates by just adding them to <code>%ICal_Dates</code>. Now that it's less work to test with more dates, you'll be inclined to just throw more in as you think of them. Only problem is, every time we add to that we have to keep adjusting the <code>use Test::More tests =&gt; ##</code> line. That can rapidly get annoying. There are ways to make this work better.</p> <p>First, we can calculate the plan dynamically using the <code>plan()</code> function.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::More;
use Date::ICal;

my %ICal_Dates = (
    ...same as before...
);

# For each key in the hash we're running 8 tests.
plan tests =&gt; keys(%ICal_Dates) * 8;

...and then your tests...</code></pre> <p>To be even more flexible, use <code>done_testing</code>. This means we're just running some tests, don't know how many. [6]</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Test::More;   # instead of tests =&gt; 32

... # tests here

done_testing();   # reached the end safely</code></pre> <p>If you don't specify a plan, <a href="Test::More.html">Test::More</a> expects to see <code>done_testing()</code> before your program exits. It will warn you if you forget it. You can give <code>done_testing()</code> an optional number of tests you expected to run, and if the number ran differs, <a href="Test::More.html">Test::More</a> will give you another kind of warning.</p> <h3 id="Informative-names">
Informative names</h3> <p>Take a look at the line:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>ok( defined $ical,            "new(ical =&gt; '$ical_str')" );</code></pre> <p>We've added more detail about what we're testing and the ICal string itself we're trying out to the name. So you get results like:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">ok 25 - new(ical =&gt; '19971024T120000')
ok 26 -   and it's the right class
ok 27 -   year()
ok 28 -   month()
ok 29 -   day()
ok 30 -   hour()
ok 31 -   min()
ok 32 -   sec()</code></pre> <p>If something in there fails, you'll know which one it was and that will make tracking down the problem easier. Try to put a bit of debugging information into the test names.</p> <p>Describe what the tests test, to make debugging a failed test easier for you or for the next person who runs your test.</p> <h3 id="Skipping-tests">
Skipping tests</h3> <p>Poking around in the existing <a href="Date::ICal.html">Date::ICal</a> tests, I found this in <i>t/01sanity.t</i> [7]</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

Even though Perl smooths out the differences for the most part, certain ports do it differently. MacPerl is one off the top of my head.

<p>You can actually take this one step further and test the manual itself. Have a look at <a href="Test::Inline.html">Test::Inline</a> (formerly <a href="Pod::Tests.html">Pod::Tests</a>).</p> </li> <li>
<p>Yes, there's a mistake in the test suite. What! Me, contrived?</p> </li> <li>
<p>We'll get to testing the contents of lists later.</p> </li> <li>
<p>But what happens if your test program dies halfway through?! Since we didn't say how many tests we're going to run, how can we know it failed? No problem, <a href="Test::More.html">Test::More</a> employs some magic to catch that death and turn the test into a failure, even if every test passed up to that point.</p> </li> <li>
<p>I cleaned it up a little.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Most Operating Systems record time as the number of seconds since a certain date. This date is the beginning of the epoch. Unix's starts at midnight January 1st, 1970 GMT.</p> </li> <li>
<p>MacOS's epoch is midnight January 1st, 1904. VMS's is midnight, November 17th, 1858, but vmsperl emulates the Unix epoch so it's not a problem.</p> </li> <li>
<p>As long as the code inside the SKIP block at least compiles. Please don't ask how. No, it's not a filter.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Do NOT be tempted to use TODO tests as a way to avoid fixing simple bugs!</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="AUTHORS">AUTHORS</h2> <p>Michael G Schwern &lt;schwern@pobox.com&gt; and the perl-qa dancers!</p> <h2 id="MAINTAINERS">MAINTAINERS</h2> <dl> <dt id="Chad-Granum">
