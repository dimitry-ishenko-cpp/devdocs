It is intended as a "bootstrap" guide for those who are new to the language, and provides just enough information for you to be able to read other peoples' Perl and understand roughly what it's doing, or write your own simple scripts.</p> <p>This introductory document does not aim to be complete. It does not even aim to be entirely accurate. In some cases perfection has been sacrificed in the goal of getting the general idea across. You are <i>strongly</i> advised to follow this introduction with more information from the full Perl manual, the table of contents to which can be found in <a href="perltoc.html">perltoc</a>.</p> <p>Throughout this document you'll see references to other parts of the Perl documentation. You can read that documentation using the <code>perldoc</code> command or whatever method you're using to read this document.</p> <p>Throughout Perl's documentation, you'll find numerous examples intended to help explain the discussed features. Please keep in mind that many of them are code fragments rather than complete programs.</p> <p>These examples often reflect the style and preference of the author of that piece of the documentation, and may be briefer than a corresponding line of code in a real program. Except where otherwise noted, you should assume that <code>use strict</code> and <code>use warnings</code> statements appear earlier in the "program", and that any variables used have already been declared, even if those declarations have been omitted to make the example easier to read.</p> <p>Do note that the examples have been written by many different authors over a period of several decades. Styles and techniques will therefore differ, although some effort has been made to not vary styles too widely in the same sections. Do not consider one style to be better than others - "There's More Than One Way To Do It" is one of Perl's mottos. After all, in your journey as a programmer, you are likely to encounter different styles.</p> <h3 id="What-is-Perl?">
What is Perl?</h3> <p>Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally developed for text manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including system administration, web development, network programming, GUI development, and more.</p> <p>The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). Its major features are that it's easy to use, supports both procedural and object-oriented (OO) programming, has powerful built-in support for text processing, and has one of the world's most impressive collections of third-party modules.</p> <p>Different definitions of Perl are given in <a href="perl.html">perl</a>, <a href="perlfaq1.html">perlfaq1</a> and no doubt other places. From this we can determine that Perl is different things to different people, but that lots of people think it's at least worth writing about.</p> <h3 id="Running-Perl-programs">
Running Perl programs</h3> <p>To run a Perl program from the Unix command line:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl progname.pl</code></pre> <p>Alternatively, put this as the first line of your script:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">#!/usr/bin/env perl</code></pre> <p>... and run the script as <i>/path/to/script.pl</i>. Of course, it'll need to be executable first, so <code>chmod 755 script.pl</code> (under Unix).</p> <p>(This start line assumes you have the <b>env</b> program. You can also put directly the path to your perl executable, like in <code>#!/usr/bin/perl</code>).</p> <p>For more information, including instructions for other platforms such as Windows, read <a href="perlrun.html">perlrun</a>.</p> <h3 id="Safety-net">
Safety net</h3> <p>Perl by default is very forgiving. In order to make it more robust it is recommended to start every program with the following lines:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;</code></pre> <p>The two additional lines request from perl to catch various common problems in your code. They check different things so you need both. A potential problem caught by <code>use strict;</code> will cause your code to stop immediately when it is encountered, while <code>use warnings;</code> will merely give a warning (like the command-line switch <b>-w</b>) and let your code run. To read more about them, check their respective manual pages at <a href="strict.html">strict</a> and <a href="warnings.html">warnings</a>.</p> <p>A <code><a href="perlfunc.html#use-VERSION">use v5.35</a></code> (or higher) declaration will enable both <code>strict</code> and <code>warnings</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use v5.35;</code></pre> <p>In addition to enabling the <code>strict</code> and <code>warnings</code> pragmata, this declaration will also activate a <a href="feature.html#FEATURE-BUNDLES">"feature bundle"</a>; a collection of named features that enable many of the more recent additions and changes to the language, as well as occasionally removing older features found to have been mistakes in design and discouraged.</p> <h3 id="Basic-syntax-overview">
Basic syntax overview</h3> <p>A Perl script or program consists of one or more statements. These statements are simply written in the script in a straightforward fashion. There is no need to have a <code>main()</code> function or anything of that kind.</p> <p>Perl statements end in a semi-colon:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "Hello, world";</code></pre> <p>Comments start with a hash symbol and run to the end of the line</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext"># This is a comment</code></pre> <p>Whitespace is irrelevant:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print
    "Hello, world"
    ;</code></pre> <p>... except inside quoted strings:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code># this would print with a linebreak in the middle
print "Hello
world";</code></pre> <p>Double quotes or single quotes may be used around literal strings:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "Hello, world";
print 'Hello, world';</code></pre> <p>However, only double quotes "interpolate" variables and special characters such as newlines (<code>\n</code>):</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "Hello, $name\n";     # works fine
print 'Hello, $name\n';     # prints $name\n literally</code></pre> <p>Numbers don't need quotes around them:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print 42;</code></pre> <p>You can use parentheses for functions' arguments or omit them according to your personal taste. They are only required occasionally to clarify issues of precedence.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print("Hello, world\n");
print "Hello, world\n";</code></pre> <p>More detailed information about Perl syntax can be found in <a href="perlsyn.html">perlsyn</a>.</p> <h3 id="Perl-variable-types">
Perl variable types</h3> <p>Perl has three main variable types: scalars, arrays, and hashes.</p> <dl> <dt id="Scalars">Scalars</dt> <dd> <p>A scalar represents a single value:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $animal = "camel";
my $answer = 42;</code></pre> <p>Scalar values can be strings, integers or floating point numbers, and Perl will automatically convert between them as required. You have to declare them using the <code>my</code> keyword the first time you use them. (This is one of the requirements of <code>use strict;</code>.)</p> <p>Scalar values can be used in various ways:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print $animal;
print "The animal is $animal\n";
print "The square of $answer is ", $answer * $answer, "\n";</code></pre> <p>Perl defines a number of special scalars with short names, often single punctuation marks or digits. These variables are used for all kinds of purposes, and are documented in <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>. The only one you need to know about for now is <code>$_</code> which is the "default variable". It's used as the default argument to a number of functions in Perl, and it's set implicitly by certain looping constructs.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print;          # prints contents of $_ by default</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="Arrays">Arrays</dt> <dd> <p>An array represents a list of values:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @animals = ("camel", "llama", "owl");
my @numbers = (23, 42, 69);
my @mixed   = ("camel", 42, 1.23);</code></pre> <p>Arrays are zero-indexed. Here's how you get at elements in an array:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print $animals[0];              # prints "camel"
print $animals[1];              # prints "llama"</code></pre> <p>The special variable <code>$#array</code> tells you the index of the last element of an array:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print $mixed[$#mixed];       # last element, prints 1.23</code></pre> <p>You might be tempted to use <code>$#array + 1</code> to tell you how many items there are in an array. Don't bother. As it happens, using <code>@array</code> where Perl expects to find a scalar value ("in scalar context") will give you the number of elements in the array:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>if (@animals &lt; 5) { ... }</code></pre> <p>The elements we're getting from the array start with a <code>$</code> because we're getting just a single value out of the array; you ask for a scalar, you get a scalar.</p> <p>To get multiple values from an array:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@animals[0,1];                 # gives ("camel", "llama");
@animals[0..2];                # gives ("camel", "llama", "owl");
@animals[1..$#animals];        # gives all except the first element</code></pre> <p>This is called an "array slice".</p> <p>You can do various useful things to lists:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @sorted    = sort @animals;
my @backwards = reverse @numbers;</code></pre> <p>There are a couple of special arrays too, such as <code>@ARGV</code> (the command line arguments to your script) and <code>@_</code> (the arguments passed to a subroutine). These are documented in <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>.</p> </dd> <dt id="Hashes">Hashes</dt> <dd> <p>A hash represents a set of key/value pairs:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my %fruit_color = ("apple", "red", "banana", "yellow");</code></pre> <p>You can use whitespace and the <code>=&gt;</code> operator to lay them out more nicely:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my %fruit_color = (
    apple  =&gt; "red",
    banana =&gt; "yellow",
);</code></pre> <p>To get at hash elements:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$fruit_color{"apple"};           # gives "red"</code></pre> <p>You can get at lists of keys and values with <code>keys()</code> and <code>values()</code>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my @fruits = keys %fruit_color;
my @colors = values %fruit_color;</code></pre> <p>Hashes have no particular internal order, though you can sort the keys and loop through them.</p> <p>Just like special scalars and arrays, there are also special hashes. The most well known of these is <code>%ENV</code> which contains environment variables. Read all about it (and other special variables) in <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>Scalars, arrays and hashes are documented more fully in <a href="perldata.html">perldata</a>.</p> <p>More complex data types can be constructed using references, which allow you to build lists and hashes within lists and hashes.</p> <p>A reference is a scalar value and can refer to any other Perl data type. So by storing a reference as the value of an array or hash element, you can easily create lists and hashes within lists and hashes. The following example shows a 2 level hash of hash structure using anonymous hash references.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $variables = {
    scalar  =&gt;  {
                 description =&gt; "single item",
                 sigil =&gt; '$',
                },
    array   =&gt;  {
                 description =&gt; "ordered list of items",
                 sigil =&gt; '@',
                },
    hash    =&gt;  {
                 description =&gt; "key/value pairs",
                 sigil =&gt; '%',
                },
};

print "Scalars begin with a $variables-&gt;{'scalar'}-&gt;{'sigil'}\n";</code></pre> <p>Exhaustive information on the topic of references can be found in <a href="perlreftut.html">perlreftut</a>, <a href="perllol.html">perllol</a>, <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a> and <a href="perldsc.html">perldsc</a>.</p> <h3 id="Variable-scoping">
Variable scoping</h3> <p>Throughout the previous section all the examples have used the syntax:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $var = "value";</code></pre> <p>The <code>my</code> is actually not required; you could just use:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$var = "value";</code></pre> <p>However, the above usage will create global variables throughout your program, which is bad programming practice. <code>my</code> creates lexically scoped variables instead. The variables are scoped to the block (i.e. a bunch of statements surrounded by curly-braces) in which they are defined.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $x = "foo";
my $some_condition = 1;
if ($some_condition) {
    my $y = "bar";
    print $x;           # prints "foo"
    print $y;           # prints "bar"
}
print $x;               # prints "foo"
print $y;               # prints nothing; $y has fallen out of scope</code></pre> <p>Using <code>my</code> in combination with a <code>use strict;</code> at the top of your Perl scripts means that the interpreter will pick up certain common programming errors. For instance, in the example above, the final <code>print $y</code> would cause a compile-time error and prevent you from running the program. Using <code>strict</code> is highly recommended.</p> <h3 id="Conditional-and-looping-constructs">
Conditional and looping constructs</h3> <p>Perl has most of the usual conditional and looping constructs.</p> <p>The conditions can be any Perl expression. See the list of operators in the next section for information on comparison and boolean logic operators, which are commonly used in conditional statements.</p> <dl> <dt id="if">if</dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>if ( condition ) {
    ...
} elsif ( other condition ) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}</code></pre> <p>There's also a negated version of it:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>unless ( condition ) {
    ...
}</code></pre> <p>This is provided as a more readable version of <code>if (!<i>condition</i>)</code>.</p> <p>Note that the braces are required in Perl, even if you've only got one line in the block. However, there is a clever way of making your one-line conditional blocks more English like:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code># the traditional way
if ($zippy) {
    print "Yow!";
}

# the Perlish post-condition way
print "Yow!" if $zippy;
print "We have no bananas" unless $bananas;</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="while">while</dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>while ( condition ) {
    ...
}</code></pre> <p>There's also a negated version, for the same reason we have <code>unless</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>until ( condition ) {
    ...
}</code></pre> <p>You can also use <code>while</code> in a post-condition:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print "LA LA LA\n" while 1;          # loops forever</code></pre> </dd> <dt id="for">for</dt> <dd> <p>Exactly like C:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>for ($i = 0; $i &lt;= $max; $i++) {
    ...
}</code></pre> <p>The C style for loop is rarely needed in Perl since Perl provides the more friendly list scanning <code>foreach</code> loop.</p> </dd> <dt id="foreach">foreach</dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code>foreach (@array) {
    print "This element is $_\n";
}

print $list[$_] foreach 0 .. $max;

# you don't have to use the default $_ either...
foreach my $key (keys %hash) {
    print "The value of $key is $hash{$key}\n";
}</code></pre> <p>The <code>foreach</code> keyword is actually a synonym for the <code>for</code> keyword. See <code><a href="perlsyn.html#Foreach-Loops">"Foreach Loops" in perlsyn</a></code>.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>For more detail on looping constructs (and some that weren't mentioned in this overview) see <a href="perlsyn.html">perlsyn</a>.</p> <h3 id="Builtin-operators-and-functions">
Builtin operators and functions</h3> <p>Perl comes with a wide selection of builtin functions. Some of the ones we've already seen include <code>print</code>, <code>sort</code> and <code>reverse</code>. A list of them is given at the start of <a href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> and you can easily read about any given function by using <code>perldoc -f <i>functionname</i></code>.</p> <p>Perl operators are documented in full in <a href="perlop.html">perlop</a>, but here are a few of the most common ones:</p> <dl> <dt id="Arithmetic">Arithmetic</dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">+   addition

Because we don't have special variable types, and Perl needs to know whether to sort numerically (where 99 is less than 100) or alphabetically (where 100 comes before 99).</p> </dd> <dt id="Boolean-logic">
Boolean logic</dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">&amp;&amp;  and

They're also supported as operators in their own right. They're more readable than the C-style operators, but have different precedence to <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and friends. Check <a href="perlop.html">perlop</a> for more detail.)</p> </dd> <dt id="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</dt> <dd> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">=   assignment

$a -= 1;        # same as $a = $a - 1
$a .= "\n";     # same as $a = $a . "\n";</code></pre> <h3 id="Files-and-I/O">
Files and I/O</h3> <p>You can open a file for input or output using the <code>open()</code> function. It's documented in extravagant detail in <a href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> and <a href="perlopentut.html">perlopentut</a>, but in short:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open(my $in,  "&lt;",  "input.txt")  or die "Can't open input.txt: $!";
open(my $out, "&gt;",  "output.txt") or die "Can't open output.txt: $!";
open(my $log, "&gt;&gt;", "my.log")     or die "Can't open my.log: $!";</code></pre> <p>You can read from an open filehandle using the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> operator. In scalar context it reads a single line from the filehandle, and in list context it reads the whole file in, assigning each line to an element of the list:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $line  = &lt;$in&gt;;
my @lines = &lt;$in&gt;;</code></pre> <p>Reading in the whole file at one time is called slurping. It can be useful but it may be a memory hog. Most text file processing can be done a line at a time with Perl's looping constructs.</p> <p>The <code>&lt;&gt;</code> operator is most often seen in a <code>while</code> loop:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>while (&lt;$in&gt;) {     # assigns each line in turn to $_
    print "Just read in this line: $_";
}</code></pre> <p>We've already seen how to print to standard output using <code>print()</code>. However, <code>print()</code> can also take an optional first argument specifying which filehandle to print to:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print STDERR "This is your final warning.\n";
print $out $record;
print $log $logmessage;</code></pre> <p>When you're done with your filehandles, you should <code>close()</code> them (though to be honest, Perl will clean up after you if you forget):</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>close $in or die "$in: $!";</code></pre> <h3 id="Regular-expressions">
Regular expressions</h3> <p>Perl's regular expression support is both broad and deep, and is the subject of lengthy documentation in <a href="perlrequick.html">perlrequick</a>, <a href="perlretut.html">perlretut</a>, and elsewhere. However, in short:</p> <dl> <dt id="Simple-matching">

Other regexp features</dt> <dd> <p>Perl regexps also support backreferences, lookaheads, and all kinds of other complex details. Read all about them in <a href="perlrequick.html">perlrequick</a>, <a href="perlretut.html">perlretut</a>, and <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p> </dd> </dl> <h3 id="Writing-subroutines">
Writing subroutines</h3> <p>Writing subroutines is easy:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub logger {
   my $logmessage = shift;
   open my $logfile, "&gt;&gt;", "my.log" or die "Could not open my.log: $!";
   print $logfile $logmessage;
}</code></pre> <p>Now we can use the subroutine just as any other built-in function:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>logger("We have a logger subroutine!");</code></pre> <p>What's that <code>shift</code>? Well, the arguments to a subroutine are available to us as a special array called <code>@_</code> (see <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a> for more on that). The default argument to the <code>shift</code> function just happens to be <code>@_</code>. So <code>my $logmessage = shift;</code> shifts the first item off the list of arguments and assigns it to <code>$logmessage</code>.</p> <p>We can manipulate <code>@_</code> in other ways too:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my ($logmessage, $priority) = @_;       # common
my $logmessage = $_[0];                 # uncommon, and ugly</code></pre> <p>Subroutines can also return values:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub square {
    my $num = shift;
    my $result = $num * $num;
    return $result;
}</code></pre> <p>Then use it like:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$sq = square(8);</code></pre> <p>For more information on writing subroutines, see <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p> <h3 id="OO-Perl">
OO Perl</h3> <p>OO Perl is relatively simple and is implemented using references which know what sort of object they are based on Perl's concept of packages. However, OO Perl is largely beyond the scope of this document. Read <a href="perlootut.html">perlootut</a> and <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p> <p>As a beginning Perl programmer, your most common use of OO Perl will be in using third-party modules, which are documented below.</p> <h3 id="Using-Perl-modules">
Using Perl modules</h3> <p>Perl modules provide a range of features to help you avoid reinventing the wheel, and can be downloaded from CPAN ( <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a> ). A number of popular modules are included with the Perl distribution itself.</p> <p>Categories of modules range from text manipulation to network protocols to database integration to graphics. A categorized list of modules is also available from CPAN.</p> <p>To learn how to install modules you download from CPAN, read <a href="perlmodinstall.html">perlmodinstall</a>.</p> <p>To learn how to use a particular module, use <code>perldoc <i>Module::Name</i></code>. Typically you will want to <code>use <i>Module::Name</i></code>, which will then give you access to exported functions or an OO interface to the module.</p> <p><a href="perlfaq.html">perlfaq</a> contains questions and answers related to many common tasks, and often provides suggestions for good CPAN modules to use.</p> <p><a href="perlmod.html">perlmod</a> describes Perl modules in general. <a href="perlmodlib.html">perlmodlib</a> lists the modules which came with your Perl installation.</p> <p>If you feel the urge to write Perl modules, <a href="perlnewmod.html">perlnewmod</a> will give you good advice.</p> <h2 id="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</h2> <p>Kirrily "Skud" Robert &lt;skud@cpan.org&gt;</p><div class="_attribution">
