It is exported from File::Compare by default.</p> <p>File::Compare::cmp is a synonym for File::Compare::compare. It is exported from File::Compare only by request.</p> <p>File::Compare::compare_text does a line by line comparison of the two files. It stops as soon as a difference is detected. compare_text() accepts an optional third argument: This must be a CODE reference to a line comparison function, which returns 0 when both lines are considered equal. For example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>compare_text($file1, $file2)</code></pre> <p>is basically equivalent to</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>compare_text($file1, $file2, sub {$_[0] ne $_[1]} )</code></pre> <h2 id="RETURN">RETURN</h2> <p>File::Compare::compare and its sibling functions return 0 if the files are equal, 1 if the files are unequal, or -1 if an error was encountered.</p> <h2 id="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</h2> <p>File::Compare was written by Nick Ing-Simmons. Its original documentation was written by Chip Salzenberg.</p><div class="_attribution">
