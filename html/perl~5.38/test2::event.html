$bool_or_undef = $e-&gt;related($e2)</dt> <dd> <p>Check if 2 events are related. In this case related means their traces share a signature meaning they were created with the same context (or at the very least by contexts which share an id, which is the same thing unless someone is doing something very bad).</p> <p>This can be used to reliably link multiple events created by the same tool. For instance a failing test like <code>ok(0, "fail"</code> will generate 2 events, one being a <a href="Test2::Event::Ok.html">Test2::Event::Ok</a>, the other being a <a href="Test2::Event::Diag.html">Test2::Event::Diag</a>, both of these events are related having been created under the same context and by the same initial tool (though multiple tools may have been nested under the initial one).</p> <p>This will return <code>undef</code> if the relationship cannot be checked, which happens if either event has an incomplete or missing trace. This will return <code>0</code> if the traces are complete, but do not match. <code>1</code> will be returned if there is a match.</p> </dd> <dt id="$e-&gt;add_amnesty({tag-=&gt;-$TAG,-details-=&gt;-$DETAILS});">
$e-&gt;add_amnesty({tag =&gt; $TAG, details =&gt; $DETAILS});</dt> <dd> <p>This can be used to add amnesty to this event. Amnesty only effects failing assertions in most cases, but some formatters may display them for passing assertions, or even non-assertions as well.</p> <p>Amnesty will prevent a failed assertion from causing the overall test to fail. In other words it marks a failure as expected and allowed.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> This is how 'TODO' is implemented under the hood. TODO is essentially amnesty with the 'TODO' tag. The details are the reason for the TODO.</p> </dd> <dt id="$uuid-=-$e-&gt;uuid">
$uuid = $e-&gt;uuid</dt> <dd> <p>If UUID tagging is enabled (See <a href="Test::API.html">Test::API</a>) then any event that has made its way through a hub will be tagged with a UUID. A newly created event will not yet be tagged in most cases.</p> </dd> <dt id="$class-=-$e-&gt;load_facet($name)">

This caches the result at the class level so that future calls will be faster.</p> <p>The <code>$name</code> variable should be the key used to access the facet in a facets hashref. For instance the assertion facet has the key 'assert', the information facet has the 'info' key, and the error facet has the key 'errors'. You may include or omit the 's' at the end of the name, the method is smart enough to try both the 's' and no-'s' forms, it will check what you provided first, and if that is not found it will add or strip the 's and try again.</p> </dd> <dt id="@classes-=-$e-&gt;FACET_TYPES()">

WHAT ARE FACETS?</h4> <p>Facets are how events convey their purpose to the Test2 internals and formatters. An event without facets will have no intentional effect on the overall test state, and will not be displayed at all by most formatters, except perhaps to say that an event of an unknown type was seen.</p> <p>Facets are produced by the <code>facet_data()</code> subroutine, which you should nearly-always override. <code>facet_data()</code> is expected to return a hashref where each key is the facet type, and the value is either a hashref with the data for that facet, or an array of hashrefs. Some facets must be defined as single hashrefs, some must be defined as an array of hashrefs, No facets allow both.</p> <p><code>facet_data()</code> <b>MUST NOT</b> bless the data it returns, the main hashref, and nested facet hashrefs <b>MUST</b> be bare, though items contained within each facet may be blessed. The data returned by this method <b>should</b> also be copies of the internal data in order to prevent accidental state modification.</p> <p><code>facets()</code> takes the data from <code>facet_data()</code> and blesses it into the <code>Test2::EventFacet::*</code> packages. This is rarely used however, the EventFacet packages are primarily for convenience and documentation. The EventFacet classes are not used at all internally, instead the raw data is used.</p> <p>Here is a list of facet types by package. The packages are not used internally, but are where the documentation for each type is kept.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> Every single facet type has the <code>'details'</code> field. This field is always intended for human consumption, and when provided, should explain the 'why' for the facet. All other fields are facet specific.</p> <dl> <dt id="about-=&gt;-{...}">
about =&gt; {...}</dt> <dd> <p><a href="Test2::EventFacet::About.html">Test2::EventFacet::About</a></p> <p>This contains information about the event itself such as the event package name.

assert =&gt; {...}</dt> <dd> <p><a href="Test2::EventFacet::Assert.html">Test2::EventFacet::Assert</a></p> <p>This facet is used if an assertion was made. The <code>details</code> field of this facet is the description of the assertion.</p> </dd> <dt id="control-=&gt;-{...}">
control =&gt; {...}</dt> <dd> <p><a href="Test2::EventFacet::Control.html">Test2::EventFacet::Control</a></p> <p>This facet is used to tell the <a href="Test2::Event::Hub.html">Test2::Event::Hub</a> about special actions the event causes. Things like halting all testing, terminating the current test, etc. In this facet the <code>details</code> field explains why any special action was taken.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> This is how bail-out is implemented.</p> </dd> <dt id="meta-=&gt;-{...}">
meta =&gt; {...}</dt> <dd> <p><a href="Test2::EventFacet::Meta.html">Test2::EventFacet::Meta</a></p> <p>The meta facet contains all the meta-data attached to the event.

parent =&gt; {...}</dt> <dd> <p><a href="Test2::EventFacet::Parent.html">Test2::EventFacet::Parent</a></p> <p>This facet contains nested events and similar details for subtests.

plan =&gt; {...}</dt> <dd> <p><a href="Test2::EventFacet::Plan.html">Test2::EventFacet::Plan</a></p> <p>This facet tells the system that a plan has been set. The <code>details</code> field of this is usually left empty, but when present explains why the plan is what it is, this is most useful if the plan is to skip-all.</p> </dd> <dt id="trace-=&gt;-{...}">
trace =&gt; {...}</dt> <dd> <p><a href="Test2::EventFacet::Trace.html">Test2::EventFacet::Trace</a></p> <p>This facet contains information related to when and where the event was generated.

amnesty =&gt; [{...}, ...]</dt> <dd> <p><a href="Test2::EventFacet::Amnesty.html">Test2::EventFacet::Amnesty</a></p> <p>The amnesty facet is a list instead of a single item, this is important as amnesty can come from multiple places at once.</p> <p>For each instance of amnesty the <code>details</code> field explains why amnesty was granted.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> Outside of formatters amnesty only acts to forgive a failing assertion.</p> </dd> <dt id="errors-=&gt;-[{...},-...]">
errors =&gt; [{...}, ...]</dt> <dd> <p><a href="Test2::EventFacet::Error.html">Test2::EventFacet::Error</a></p> <p>The errors facet is a list instead of a single item, any number of errors can be listed. In this facet <code>details</code> describes the error, or may contain the raw error message itself (such as an exception). In perl exception may be blessed objects, as such the raw data for this facet may contain nested items which are blessed.</p> <p>Not all errors are considered fatal, there is a <code>fail</code> field that must be set for an error to cause the test to fail.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> This facet is unique in that the field name is 'errors' while the package is 'Error'. This is because this is the only facet type that is both a list, and has a name where the plural is not the same as the singular. This may cause some confusion, but I feel it will be less confusing than the alternative.</p> </dd> <dt id="info-=&gt;-[{...},-...]">

This info may be a string, or it may be a data structure to display. This is one of the few facet types that may contain blessed items.</p> </dd> </dl> <h3 id="LEGACY-API">
