How do I do fancy stuff with the keyboard/screen/mouse?</h3> <p>How you access/control keyboards, screens, and pointing devices ("mice") is system-dependent.

How do I print something out in color?</h3> <p>In general, you don't, because you don't know whether the recipient has a color-aware display device. If you know that they have an ANSI terminal that understands color, you can use the <a href="Term::ANSIColor.html">Term::ANSIColor</a> module from CPAN:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Term::ANSIColor;
print color("red"), "Stop!\n", color("reset");
print color("green"), "Go!\n", color("reset");</code></pre> <p>Or like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Term::ANSIColor qw(:constants);

How do I read just one key without waiting for a return key?</h3> <p>Controlling input buffering is a remarkably system-dependent matter. On many systems, you can just use the <b>stty</b> command as shown in <a href="perlfunc.html#getc">"getc" in perlfunc</a>, but as you see, that's already getting you into portability snags.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open(TTY, "+&lt;/dev/tty") or die "no tty: $!";
system "stty  cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1";

# OR ELSE
sysread(TTY, $key, 1);    # probably this does
system "stty -cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1";</code></pre> <p>The <a href="Term::ReadKey.html">Term::ReadKey</a> module from CPAN offers an easy-to-use interface that should be more efficient than shelling out to <b>stty</b> for each key. It even includes limited support for Windows.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Term::ReadKey;
ReadMode('cbreak');
$key = ReadKey(0);
ReadMode('normal');</code></pre> <p>However, using the code requires that you have a working C compiler and can use it to build and install a CPAN module. Here's a solution using the standard <a href="posix.html">POSIX</a> module, which is already on your system (assuming your system supports POSIX).</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use HotKey;
$key = readkey();</code></pre> <p>And here's the <code>HotKey</code> module, which hides the somewhat mystifying calls to manipulate the POSIX termios structures.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code># HotKey.pm

How do I check whether input is ready on the keyboard?</h3> <p>The easiest way to do this is to read a key in nonblocking mode with the <a href="Term::ReadKey.html">Term::ReadKey</a> module from CPAN, passing it an argument of -1 to indicate not to block:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Term::ReadKey;

ReadMode('cbreak');

    # input was waiting and it was $char

    # no input was waiting
}

How do I clear the screen?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>To clear the screen, you just have to print the special sequence that tells the terminal to clear the screen. Once you have that sequence, output it when you want to clear the screen.</p> <p>You can use the <a href="Term::ANSIScreen.html">Term::ANSIScreen</a> module to get the special sequence. Import the <code>cls</code> function (or the <code>:screen</code> tag):</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Term::ANSIScreen qw(cls);
my $clear_screen = cls();

print $clear_screen;</code></pre> <p>The <a href="Term::Cap.html">Term::Cap</a> module can also get the special sequence if you want to deal with the low-level details of terminal control. The <code>Tputs</code> method returns the string for the given capability:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Term::Cap;

my $terminal = Term::Cap-&gt;Tgetent( { OSPEED =&gt; 9600 } );
my $clear_screen = $terminal-&gt;Tputs('cl');

print $clear_screen;</code></pre> <p>On Windows, you can use the <a href="Win32::Console.html">Win32::Console</a> module. After creating an object for the output filehandle you want to affect, call the <code>Cls</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>Win32::Console;

my $OUT = Win32::Console-&gt;new(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
my $clear_string = $OUT-&gt;Cls;

print $clear_screen;</code></pre> <p>If you have a command-line program that does the job, you can call it in backticks to capture whatever it outputs so you can use it later:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $clear_string = `clear`;

print $clear_string;</code></pre> <h3 id="How-do-I-get-the-screen-size?">
How do I get the screen size?</h3> <p>If you have <a href="Term::ReadKey.html">Term::ReadKey</a> module installed from CPAN, you can use it to fetch the width and height in characters and in pixels:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Term::ReadKey;
my ($wchar, $hchar, $wpixels, $hpixels) = GetTerminalSize();</code></pre> <p>This is more portable than the raw <code>ioctl</code>, but not as illustrative:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>require './sys/ioctl.ph';
die "no TIOCGWINSZ " unless defined &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;
open(my $tty_fh, "+&lt;/dev/tty")                     or die "No tty: $!";
unless (ioctl($tty_fh, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ, $winsize='')) {

How do I ask the user for a password?</h3> <p>(This question has nothing to do with the web. See a different FAQ for that.)</p> <p>There's an example of this in <a href="perlfunc.html#crypt">"crypt" in perlfunc</a>. First, you put the terminal into "no echo" mode, then just read the password normally. You may do this with an old-style <code>ioctl()</code> function, POSIX terminal control (see <a href="posix.html">POSIX</a> or its documentation the Camel Book), or a call to the <b>stty</b> program, with varying degrees of portability.</p> <p>You can also do this for most systems using the <a href="Term::ReadKey.html">Term::ReadKey</a> module from CPAN, which is easier to use and in theory more portable.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use Term::ReadKey;

ReadMode('noecho');
my $password = ReadLine(0);</code></pre> <h3 id="How-do-I-read-and-write-the-serial-port?">
How do I read and write the serial port?</h3> <p>This depends on which operating system your program is running on. In the case of Unix, the serial ports will be accessible through files in <code>/dev</code>; on other systems, device names will doubtless differ. Several problem areas common to all device interaction are the following:</p> <dl> <dt id="lockfiles">lockfiles</dt> <dd> <p>Your system may use lockfiles to control multiple access. Make sure you follow the correct protocol. Unpredictable behavior can result from multiple processes reading from one device.</p> </dd> <dt id="open-mode">
open mode</dt> <dd> <p>If you expect to use both read and write operations on the device, you'll have to open it for update (see <a href="perlfunc.html#open">"open" in perlfunc</a> for details). You may wish to open it without running the risk of blocking by using <code>sysopen()</code> and <code>O_RDWR|O_NDELAY|O_NOCTTY</code> from the <a href="fcntl.html">Fcntl</a> module (part of the standard perl distribution). See <a href="perlfunc.html#sysopen">"sysopen" in perlfunc</a> for more on this approach.</p> </dd> <dt id="end-of-line">
end of line</dt> <dd> <p>Some devices will be expecting a "\r" at the end of each line rather than a "\n". In some ports of perl, "\r" and "\n" are different from their usual (Unix) ASCII values of "\015" and "\012". You may have to give the numeric values you want directly, using octal ("\015"), hex ("0x0D"), or as a control-character specification ("\cM").</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print DEV "atv1\012";    # wrong, for some devices
print DEV "atv1\015";    # right, for some devices</code></pre> <p>Even though with normal text files a "\n" will do the trick, there is still no unified scheme for terminating a line that is portable between Unix, DOS/Win, and Macintosh, except to terminate <i>ALL</i> line ends with "\015\012", and strip what you don't need from the output. This applies especially to socket I/O and autoflushing, discussed next.</p> </dd> <dt id="flushing-output">
flushing output</dt> <dd> <p>If you expect characters to get to your device when you <code>print()</code> them, you'll want to autoflush that filehandle. You can use <code>select()</code> and the <code>$|</code> variable to control autoflushing (see <a href="perlvar.html#%24%7C">"$|" in perlvar</a> and <a href="perlfunc.html#select">"select" in perlfunc</a>, or <a href="perlfaq5.html">perlfaq5</a>, "How do I flush/unbuffer an output filehandle? Why must I do this?"):</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>my $old_handle = select($dev_fh);
$| = 1;
select($old_handle);</code></pre> <p>You'll also see code that does this without a temporary variable, as in</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>select((select($deb_handle), $| = 1)[0]);</code></pre> <p>Or if you don't mind pulling in a few thousand lines of code just because you're afraid of a little <code>$|</code> variable:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use IO::Handle;
$dev_fh-&gt;autoflush(1);</code></pre> <p>As mentioned in the previous item, this still doesn't work when using socket I/O between Unix and Macintosh. You'll need to hard code your line terminators, in that case.</p> </dd> <dt id="non-blocking-input">
non-blocking input</dt> <dd> <p>If you are doing a blocking <code>read()</code> or <code>sysread()</code>, you'll have to arrange for an alarm handler to provide a timeout (see <a href="perlfunc.html#alarm">"alarm" in perlfunc</a>). If you have a non-blocking open, you'll likely have a non-blocking read, which means you may have to use a 4-arg <code>select()</code> to determine whether I/O is ready on that device (see <a href="perlfunc.html#select">"select" in perlfunc</a>.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>While trying to read from his caller-id box, the notorious Jamie Zawinski <code>&lt;jwz@netscape.com&gt;</code>, after much gnashing of teeth and fighting with <code>sysread</code>, <code>sysopen</code>, POSIX's <code>tcgetattr</code> business, and various other functions that go bump in the night, finally came up with this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>sub open_modem {

How do I decode encrypted password files?</h3> <p>You spend lots and lots of money on dedicated hardware, but this is bound to get you talked about.</p> <p>Seriously, you can't if they are Unix password files--the Unix password system employs one-way encryption. It's more like hashing than encryption. The best you can do is check whether something else hashes to the same string. You can't turn a hash back into the original string.

How can I capture STDERR from an external command?</h3> <p>There are three basic ways of running external commands:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>system $cmd;        # using system()
my $output = `$cmd`;        # using backticks (``)
open (my $pipe_fh, "$cmd |");    # using open()</code></pre> <p>With <code>system()</code>, both STDOUT and STDERR will go the same place as the script's STDOUT and STDERR, unless the <code>system()</code> command redirects them. Backticks and <code>open()</code> read <b>only</b> the STDOUT of your command.</p> <p>You can also use the <code>open3()</code> function from <a href="IPC::Open3.html">IPC::Open3</a>. Benjamin Goldberg provides some sample code:</p> <p>To capture a program's STDOUT, but discard its STDERR:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use IPC::Open3;
use File::Spec;
my $in = '';
open(NULL, "&gt;", File::Spec-&gt;devnull);
my $pid = open3($in, \*PH, "&gt;&amp;NULL", "cmd");

my $pid = open3($in, "&gt;&amp;NULL", \*PH, "cmd");
while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }
waitpid($pid, 0);</code></pre> <p>To capture a program's STDERR, and let its STDOUT go to our own STDERR:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use IPC::Open3;
my $in = '';
my $pid = open3($in, "&gt;&amp;STDERR", \*PH, "cmd");
while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }
waitpid($pid, 0);</code></pre> <p>To read both a command's STDOUT and its STDERR separately, you can redirect them to temp files, let the command run, then read the temp files:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use IPC::Open3;
use IO::File;
my $in = '';
local *CATCHOUT = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
local *CATCHERR = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
my $pid = open3($in, "&gt;&amp;CATCHOUT", "&gt;&amp;CATCHERR", "cmd");
waitpid($pid, 0);
seek $_, 0, 0 for \*CATCHOUT, \*CATCHERR;
while( &lt;CATCHOUT&gt; ) {}
while( &lt;CATCHERR&gt; ) {}</code></pre> <p>But there's no real need for <b>both</b> to be tempfiles... the following should work just as well, without deadlocking:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use IPC::Open3;
my $in = '';
use IO::File;
local *CATCHERR = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
my $pid = open3($in, \*CATCHOUT, "&gt;&amp;CATCHERR", "cmd");
while( &lt;CATCHOUT&gt; ) {}
waitpid($pid, 0);
seek CATCHERR, 0, 0;
while( &lt;CATCHERR&gt; ) {}</code></pre> <p>And it'll be faster, too, since we can begin processing the program's stdout immediately, rather than waiting for the program to finish.</p> <p>With any of these, you can change file descriptors before the call:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open(STDOUT, "&gt;logfile");
system("ls");</code></pre> <p>or you can use Bourne shell file-descriptor redirection:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$output = `$cmd 2&gt;some_file`;
open (PIPE, "cmd 2&gt;some_file |");</code></pre> <p>You can also use file-descriptor redirection to make STDERR a duplicate of STDOUT:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$output = `$cmd 2&gt;&amp;1`;
open (PIPE, "cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 |");</code></pre> <p>Note that you <i>cannot</i> simply open STDERR to be a dup of STDOUT in your Perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection. This doesn't work:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>open(STDERR, "&gt;&amp;STDOUT");
$alloutput = `cmd args`;  # stderr still escapes</code></pre> <p>This fails because the <code>open()</code> makes STDERR go to where STDOUT was going at the time of the <code>open()</code>.

system("prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;tmpfile");</code></pre> <p>The first command sends both standard out and standard error to the temporary file.

Why doesn't open() return an error when a pipe open fails?</h3> <p>If the second argument to a piped <code>open()</code> contains shell metacharacters, perl <code>fork()</code>s, then <code>exec()</code>s a shell to decode the metacharacters and eventually run the desired program. If the program couldn't be run, it's the shell that gets the message, not Perl. All your Perl program can find out is whether the shell itself could be successfully started. You can still capture the shell's STDERR and check it for error messages. See <a href="#How-can-I-capture-STDERR-from-an-external-command%3F">"How can I capture STDERR from an external command?"</a> elsewhere in this document, or use the <a href="IPC::Open3.html">IPC::Open3</a> module.</p> <p>If there are no shell metacharacters in the argument of <code>open()</code>, Perl runs the command directly, without using the shell, and can correctly report whether the command started.</p> <h3 id="What's-wrong-with-using-backticks-in-a-void-context?">
What's wrong with using backticks in a void context?</h3> <p>Strictly speaking, nothing. Stylistically speaking, it's not a good way to write maintainable code. Perl has several operators for running external commands. Backticks are one; they collect the output from the command for use in your program. The <code>system</code> function is another; it doesn't do this.</p> <p>Writing backticks in your program sends a clear message to the readers of your code that you wanted to collect the output of the command. Why send a clear message that isn't true?</p> <p>Consider this line:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>`cat /etc/termcap`;</code></pre> <p>You forgot to check <code>$?</code> to see whether the program even ran correctly. Even if you wrote</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>print `cat /etc/termcap`;</code></pre> <p>this code could and probably should be written as</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>system("cat /etc/termcap") == 0

You can't simply write the command like this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>@ok = `grep @opts '$search_string' @filenames`;</code></pre> <p>As of Perl 5.8.0, you can use <code>open()</code> with multiple arguments.

Hiding the arguments won't make your program completely secure.</p> <p>To actually alter the visible command line, you can assign to the variable $0 as documented in <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>.

How do I find out if I'm running interactively or not?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>This is a difficult question to answer, and the best answer is only a guess.</p> <p>What do you really want to know? If you merely want to know if one of your filehandles is connected to a terminal, you can try the <code>-t</code> file test:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>if( -t STDOUT ) {
    print "I'm connected to a terminal!\n";
}</code></pre> <p>However, you might be out of luck if you expect that means there is a real person on the other side. With the <a href="expect.html">Expect</a> module, another program can pretend to be a person. The program might even come close to passing the Turing test.</p> <p>The <a href="IO::Interactive.html">IO::Interactive</a> module does the best it can to give you an answer. Its <code>is_interactive</code> function returns an output filehandle; that filehandle points to standard output if the module thinks the session is interactive. Otherwise, the filehandle is a null handle that simply discards the output:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use IO::Interactive;

print { is_interactive } "I might go to standard output!\n";</code></pre> <p>This still doesn't guarantee that a real person is answering your prompts or reading your output.</p> <p>If you want to know how to handle automated testing for your distribution, you can check the environment. The CPAN Testers, for instance, set the value of <code>AUTOMATED_TESTING</code>:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>unless( $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} ) {
    print "Hello interactive tester!\n";
}</code></pre> <h3 id="How-do-I-timeout-a-slow-event?">

You may instead use the more flexible <a href="Sys::AlarmCall.html">Sys::AlarmCall</a> module available from CPAN.</p> <p>The <code>alarm()</code> function is not implemented on all versions of Windows.

setrlimit(RLIMIT_CPU,10,20) or die $!;</code></pre> <p>This sets the soft and hard limits to 10 and 20 seconds, respectively. After 10 seconds of time spent running on the CPU (not "wall" time), the process will be sent a signal (XCPU on some systems) which, if not trapped, will cause the process to terminate. If that signal is trapped, then after 10 more seconds (20 seconds in total) the process will be killed with a non-trappable signal.</p> <p>See the <a href="BSD::Resource.html">BSD::Resource</a> and your systems documentation for the gory details.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-avoid-zombies-on-a-Unix-system?">

What's the difference between require and use?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>Perl runs <code>require</code> statement at run-time. Once Perl loads, compiles, and runs the file, it doesn't do anything else. The <code>use</code> statement is the same as a <code>require</code> run at compile-time, but Perl also calls the <code>import</code> method for the loaded package. These two are the same:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use MODULE qw(import list);

BEGIN {
    require MODULE;
    MODULE-&gt;import(import list);
}</code></pre> <p>However, you can suppress the <code>import</code> by using an explicit, empty import list. Both of these still happen at compile-time:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use MODULE ();

BEGIN {
    require MODULE;
}</code></pre> <p>Since <code>use</code> will also call the <code>import</code> method, the actual value for <code>MODULE</code> must be a bareword. That is, <code>use</code> cannot load files by name, although <code>require</code> can:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>require "$ENV{HOME}/lib/Foo.pm"; # no @INC searching!</code></pre> <p>See the entry for <code>use</code> in <a href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> for more details.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-keep-my-own-module/library-directory?">
How do I keep my own module/library directory?</h3> <p>When you build modules, tell Perl where to install the modules.</p> <p>If you want to install modules for your own use, the easiest way might be <a href="local::lib.html">local::lib</a>, which you can download from CPAN. It sets various installation settings for you, and uses those same settings within your programs.</p> <p>If you want more flexibility, you need to configure your CPAN client for your particular situation.</p> <p>For <code>Makefile.PL</code>-based distributions, use the INSTALL_BASE option when generating Makefiles:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/mydir/perl</code></pre> <p>You can set this in your <code>CPAN.pm</code> configuration so modules automatically install in your private library directory when you use the CPAN.pm shell:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">% cpan
cpan&gt; o conf makepl_arg INSTALL_BASE=/mydir/perl
cpan&gt; o conf commit</code></pre> <p>For <code>Build.PL</code>-based distributions, use the --install_base option:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl Build.PL --install_base /mydir/perl</code></pre> <p>You can configure <code>CPAN.pm</code> to automatically use this option too:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">% cpan
cpan&gt; o conf mbuild_arg "--install_base /mydir/perl"
cpan&gt; o conf commit</code></pre> <p>INSTALL_BASE tells these tools to put your modules into <i>/mydir/perl/lib/perl5</i>. See <a href="#How-do-I-add-a-directory-to-my-include-path-%28%40INC%29-at-runtime%3F">"How do I add a directory to my include path (@INC) at runtime?"</a> for details on how to run your newly installed modules.</p> <p>There is one caveat with INSTALL_BASE, though, since it acts differently from the PREFIX and LIB settings that older versions of <a href="ExtUtils::MakeMaker.html">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a> advocated. INSTALL_BASE does not support installing modules for multiple versions of Perl or different architectures under the same directory. You should consider whether you really want that and, if you do, use the older PREFIX and LIB settings.

How do I add the directory my program lives in to the module/library search path?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>If you know the directory already, you can add it to <code>@INC</code> as you would for any other directory. You might <code>use lib</code> if you know the directory at compile time:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use lib $directory;</code></pre> <p>The trick in this task is to find the directory. Before your script does anything else (such as a <code>chdir</code>), you can get the current working directory with the <code>Cwd</code> module, which comes with Perl:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>BEGIN {
    use Cwd;
    our $directory = cwd;
}

use lib $directory;</code></pre> <p>You can do a similar thing with the value of <code>$0</code>, which holds the script name. That might hold a relative path, but <code>rel2abs</code> can turn it into an absolute path. Once you have the</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>BEGIN {
    use File::Spec::Functions qw(rel2abs);
    use File::Basename qw(dirname);

}

use lib $directory;</code></pre> <p>The <a href="findbin.html">FindBin</a> module, which comes with Perl, might work.
