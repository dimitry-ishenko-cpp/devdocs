(An interactive Perl environment is also possible--see <a href="perldebug.html">perldebug</a> for details on how to do that.) Upon startup, Perl looks for your program in one of the following places:</p> <ol> <li>
<p>Specified line by line via <a href="#-e-commandline">-e</a> or <a href="#-E-commandline">-E</a> switches on the command line.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command line. (Note that systems supporting the <code>#!</code> notation invoke interpreters this way. See <a href="#Location-of-Perl">"Location of Perl"</a>.)</p> </li> <li>
<p>Passed in implicitly via standard input. This works only if there are no filename arguments--to pass arguments to a STDIN-read program you must explicitly specify a "-" for the program name.</p> </li> </ol> <p>With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file from the beginning, unless you've specified a <a href="#-x">"-x"</a> switch, in which case it scans for the first line starting with <code>#!</code> and containing the word "perl", and starts there instead. This is useful for running a program embedded in a larger message. (In this case you would indicate the end of the program using the <code>__END__</code> token.)</p> <p>The <code>#!</code> line is always examined for switches as the line is being parsed. Thus, if you're on a machine that allows only one argument with the <code>#!</code> line, or worse, doesn't even recognize the <code>#!</code> line, you still can get consistent switch behaviour regardless of how Perl was invoked, even if <a href="#-x">"-x"</a> was used to find the beginning of the program.</p> <p>Because historically some operating systems silently chopped off kernel interpretation of the <code>#!</code> line after 32 characters, some switches may be passed in on the command line, and some may not; you could even get a "-" without its letter, if you're not careful. You probably want to make sure that all your switches fall either before or after that 32-character boundary. Most switches don't actually care if they're processed redundantly, but getting a "-" instead of a complete switch could cause Perl to try to execute standard input instead of your program. And a partial <a href="#-Idirectory">-I</a> switch could also cause odd results.</p> <p>Some switches do care if they are processed twice, for instance combinations of <a href="#-l%5Boctnum%5D">-l</a> and <a href="#-0%5Boctal%2Fhexadecimal%5D">-0</a>. Either put all the switches after the 32-character boundary (if applicable), or replace the use of <b>-0</b><i>digits</i> by <code>BEGIN{ $/ = "\0digits"; }</code>.</p> <p>Parsing of the <code>#!</code> switches starts wherever "perl" is mentioned in the line. The sequences "-*" and "- " are specifically ignored so that you could, if you were so inclined, say</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>#!/bin/sh
#! -*- perl -*- -p
eval 'exec perl -x -wS $0 ${1+"$@"}'
    if 0;</code></pre> <p>to let Perl see the <a href="#-p">"-p"</a> switch.</p> <p>A similar trick involves the <i>env</i> program, if you have it.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">#!/usr/bin/env perl</code></pre> <p>The examples above use a relative path to the perl interpreter, getting whatever version is first in the user's path. If you want a specific version of Perl, say, perl5.14.1, you should place that directly in the <code>#!</code> line's path.</p> <p>If the <code>#!</code> line does not contain the word "perl" nor the word "indir", the program named after the <code>#!</code> is executed instead of the Perl interpreter. This is slightly bizarre, but it helps people on machines that don't do <code>#!</code>, because they can tell a program that their SHELL is <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>, and Perl will then dispatch the program to the correct interpreter for them.</p> <p>After locating your program, Perl compiles the entire program to an internal form. If there are any compilation errors, execution of the program is not attempted. (This is unlike the typical shell script, which might run part-way through before finding a syntax error.)</p> <p>If the program is syntactically correct, it is executed. If the program runs off the end without hitting an exit() or die() operator, an implicit <code>exit(0)</code> is provided to indicate successful completion.</p> <h3 id="#!-and-quoting-on-non-Unix-systems">
#! and quoting on non-Unix systems </h3> <p>Unix's <code>#!</code> technique can be simulated on other systems:</p> <dl> <dt id="OS/2">
OS/2</dt> <dd> <p>Put</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">extproc perl -S -your_switches</code></pre> <p>as the first line in <code>*.cmd</code> file (<a href="#-S">"-S"</a> due to a bug in cmd.exe's `extproc' handling).</p> </dd> <dt id="MS-DOS">
MS-DOS</dt> <dd> <p>Create a batch file to run your program, and codify it in <code>ALTERNATE_SHEBANG</code> (see the <i>dosish.h</i> file in the source distribution for more information).</p> </dd> <dt id="Win95/NT">
Win95/NT</dt> <dd> <p>The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState installer for Perl, will modify the Registry to associate the <i>.pl</i> extension with the perl interpreter. If you install Perl by other means (including building from the sources), you may have to modify the Registry yourself. Note that this means you can no longer tell the difference between an executable Perl program and a Perl library file.</p> </dd> <dt id="VMS">VMS</dt> <dd> <p>Put</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>$ perl -mysw 'f$env("procedure")' 'p1' 'p2' 'p3' 'p4' 'p5' 'p6' 'p7' 'p8' !
$ exit++ + ++$status != 0 and $exit = $status = undef;</code></pre> <p>at the top of your program, where <b>-mysw</b> are any command line switches you want to pass to Perl. You can now invoke the program directly, by saying <code>perl program</code>, or as a DCL procedure, by saying <code>@program</code> (or implicitly via <i>DCL$PATH</i> by just using the name of the program).</p> <p>This incantation is a bit much to remember, but Perl will display it for you if you say <code>perl "-V:startperl"</code>.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>Command-interpreters on non-Unix systems have rather different ideas on quoting than Unix shells. You'll need to learn the special characters in your command-interpreter (<code>*</code>, <code>\</code> and <code>"</code> are common) and how to protect whitespace and these characters to run one-liners (see <a href="#-e-commandline">-e</a> below).</p> <p>On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double ones, which you must <i>not</i> do on Unix or Plan 9 systems. You might also have to change a single % to a %%.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext"># Unix
perl -e 'print "Hello world\n"'

# MS-DOS, etc.
perl -e "print \"Hello world\n\""

# VMS
perl -e "print ""Hello world\n"""</code></pre> <p>The problem is that none of this is reliable: it depends on the command and it is entirely possible neither works. If <i>4DOS</i> were the command shell, this would probably work better:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">perl -e "print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;"Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;""</code></pre> <p><b>CMD.EXE</b> in Windows NT slipped a lot of standard Unix functionality in when nobody was looking, but just try to find documentation for its quoting rules.</p> <p>There is no general solution to all of this. It's just a mess.</p> <h3 id="Location-of-Perl">
Location of Perl </h3> <p>It may seem obvious to say, but Perl is useful only when users can easily find it. When possible, it's good for both <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> and <i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i> to be symlinks to the actual binary. If that can't be done, system administrators are strongly encouraged to put (symlinks to) perl and its accompanying utilities into a directory typically found along a user's PATH, or in some other obvious and convenient place.</p> <p>In this documentation, <code>#!/usr/bin/perl</code> on the first line of the program will stand in for whatever method works on your system. You are advised to use a specific path if you care about a specific version.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">#!/usr/local/bin/perl5.14</code></pre> <p>or if you just want to be running at least version, place a statement like this at the top of your program:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>use v5.14;</code></pre> <h3 id="Command-Switches">
Command Switches </h3> <p>As with all standard commands, a single-character switch may be clustered with the following switch, if any.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">#!/usr/bin/perl -spi.orig	# same as -s -p -i.orig</code></pre> <p>A <code>--</code> signals the end of options and disables further option processing. Any arguments after the <code>--</code> are treated as filenames and arguments.</p> <p>Switches include:</p> <dl> <dt id="-0[octal/hexadecimal]">
<b>-0</b>[<i>octal/hexadecimal</i>] </dt> <dd> <p>specifies the input record separator (<code>$/</code>) as an octal or hexadecimal number. If there are no digits, the null character is the separator. Other switches may precede or follow the digits. For example, if you have a version of <i>find</i> which can print filenames terminated by the null character, you can say this:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code class="plaintext">find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink</code></pre> <p>The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in paragraph mode.</p> <p>Any value 0400 or above will cause Perl to slurp files whole, but by convention the value 0777 is the one normally used for this purpose. The <a href="#-g">"-g"</a> flag is a simpler alias for it.</p> <p>You can also specify the separator character using hexadecimal notation: <b>-0x<i>HHH...</i></b>, where the <code><i>H</i></code> are valid hexadecimal digits. Unlike the octal form, this one may be used to specify any Unicode character, even those beyond 0xFF. So if you <i>really</i> want a record separator of 0777, specify it as <b>-0x1FF</b>. (This means that you cannot use the <a href="#-x">"-x"</a> option with a directory name that consists of hexadecimal digits, or else Perl will think you have specified a hex number to <b>-0</b>.)</p> </dd> <dt id="-a">
<b>-a</b> </dt> <dd> <p>turns on autosplit mode when used with a <a href="#-n">"-n"</a> or <a href="#-p">"-p"</a>. An implicit split command to the @F array is done as the first thing inside the implicit while loop produced by the <a href="#-n">"-n"</a> or <a href="#-p">"-p"</a>.</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>perl -ane 'print pop(@F), "\n";'</code></pre> <p>is equivalent to</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>    while (&lt;&gt;) {

<b>-C [<i>number/list</i>]</b> </dt> <dd> <p>The <b>-C</b> flag controls some of the Perl Unicode features.</p> <p>As of 5.8.1, the <b>-C</b> can be followed either by a number or a list of option letters.

a   256   Set ${^UTF8CACHE} to -1, to run the UTF-8 caching
          code in debugging mode.</code></pre> <p>For example, <b>-COE</b> and <b>-C6</b> will both turn on UTF-8-ness on both STDOUT and STDERR. Repeating letters is just redundant, not cumulative nor toggling.</p> <p>The <code>io</code> options mean that any subsequent open() (or similar I/O operations) in main program scope will have the <code>:utf8</code> PerlIO layer implicitly applied to them, in other words, UTF-8 is expected from any input stream, and UTF-8 is produced to any output stream. This is just the default set via <a href="perlvar.html#%24%7B%5EOPEN%7D"><code>${^OPEN}</code></a>, with explicit layers in open() and with binmode() one can manipulate streams as usual. This has no effect on code run in modules.</p> <p><b>-C</b> on its own (not followed by any number or option list), or the empty string <code>""</code> for the <a href="#PERL_UNICODE">"PERL_UNICODE"</a> environment variable, has the same effect as <b>-CSDL</b>. In other words, the standard I/O handles and the default <code>open()</code> layer are UTF-8-fied <i>but</i> only if the locale environment variables indicate a UTF-8 locale. This behaviour follows the <i>implicit</i> (and problematic) UTF-8 behaviour of Perl 5.8.0. (See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/5.38.0/perl581delta#UTF-8-no-longer-default-under-UTF-8-locales">"UTF-8 no longer default under UTF-8 locales" in perl581delta</a>.)</p> <p>You can use <b>-C0</b> (or <code>"0"</code> for <code>PERL_UNICODE</code>) to explicitly disable all the above Unicode features.</p> <p>The read-only magic variable <code>${^UNICODE}</code> reflects the numeric value of this setting. This variable is set during Perl startup and is thereafter read-only. If you want runtime effects, use the three-arg open() (see <a href="perlfunc.html#open">"open" in perlfunc</a>), the two-arg binmode() (see <a href="perlfunc.html#binmode">"binmode" in perlfunc</a>), and the <code>open</code> pragma (see <a href="open.html">open</a>).</p> <p>(In Perls earlier than 5.8.1 the <b>-C</b> switch was a Win32-only switch that enabled the use of Unicode-aware "wide system call" Win32 APIs. This feature was practically unused, however, and the command line switch was therefore "recycled".)</p> <p><b>Note:</b> Since perl 5.10.1, if the <b>-C</b> option is used on the <code>#!</code> line, it must be specified on the command line as well, since the standard streams are already set up at this point in the execution of the perl interpreter. You can also use binmode() to set the encoding of an I/O stream.</p> </dd> <dt id="-c">
<b>-c</b> </dt> <dd> <p>causes Perl to check the syntax of the program and then exit without executing it. Actually, it <i>will</i> execute any <code>BEGIN</code>, <code>UNITCHECK</code>, or <code>CHECK</code> blocks and any <code>use</code> statements: these are considered as occurring outside the execution of your program. <code>INIT</code> and <code>END</code> blocks, however, will be skipped.</p> </dd> <dt id="-d">

For example, on Win32 platforms, the ".bat" and ".cmd" suffixes are appended if a lookup for the original name fails, and if the name does not already end in one of those suffixes. If your Perl was compiled with <code>DEBUGGING</code> turned on, using the <a href="#-Dletters">-Dp</a> switch to Perl shows how the search progresses.</p> <p>Typically this is used to emulate <code>#!</code> startup on platforms that don't support <code>#!</code>. It's also convenient when debugging a script that uses <code>#!</code>, and is thus normally found by the shell's $PATH search mechanism.</p> <p>This example works on many platforms that have a shell compatible with Bourne shell:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>    #!/usr/bin/perl
    eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 ${1+"$@"}'
	    if 0; # ^ Run only under a shell</code></pre> <p>The system ignores the first line and feeds the program to <i>/bin/sh</i>, which proceeds to try to execute the Perl program as a shell script. The shell executes the second line as a normal shell command, and thus starts up the Perl interpreter. On some systems $0 doesn't always contain the full pathname, so the <a href="#-S">"-S"</a> tells Perl to search for the program if necessary. After Perl locates the program, it parses the lines and ignores them because the check 'if 0' is never true. If the program will be interpreted by csh, you will need to replace <code>${1+"$@"}</code> with <code>$*</code>, even though that doesn't understand embedded spaces (and such) in the argument list. To start up <i>sh</i> rather than <i>csh</i>, some systems may have to replace the <code>#!</code> line with a line containing just a colon, which will be politely ignored by Perl. Other systems can't control that, and need a totally devious construct that will work under any of <i>csh</i>, <i>sh</i>, or Perl, such as the following:</p> <pre data-language="perl"><code>eval '(exit $?0)' &amp;&amp; eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+"$@"}'
