<h2 class="h2" id="section-1">1.  Introduction</h2>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-
   level request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and
   self-descriptive messages for flexible interaction with network-based
   hypertext information systems.  It is typically used for distributed
   information systems, where the use of response caches can improve
   performance.  This document defines aspects of HTTP related to
   caching and reusing response messages.

   An HTTP "cache" is a local store of response messages and the
   subsystem that controls storage, retrieval, and deletion of messages
   in it.  A cache stores cacheable responses to reduce the response
   time and network bandwidth consumption on future equivalent requests.
   Any client or server MAY use a cache, though not when acting as a
   tunnel (Section 3.7 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]).

   A "shared cache" is a cache that stores responses for reuse by more
   than one user; shared caches are usually (but not always) deployed as
   a part of an intermediary.  A "private cache", in contrast, is
   dedicated to a single user; often, they are deployed as a component
   of a user agent.

   The goal of HTTP caching is significantly improving performance by
   reusing a prior response message to satisfy a current request.  A
   cache considers a stored response "fresh", as defined in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>,
   if it can be reused without "validation" (checking with the origin
   server to see if the cached response remains valid for this request).
   A fresh response can therefore reduce both latency and network
   overhead each time the cache reuses it.  When a cached response is
   not fresh, it might still be reusable if validation can freshen it
   (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>) or if the origin is unavailable (<a href="#section-4.2.4">Section 4.2.4</a>).

   This document obsoletes <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7234">RFC 7234</a>, with the changes being summarized
   in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-1.1">1.1.  Requirements Notation</h3>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Section 2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>] defines conformance criteria and contains
   considerations regarding error handling.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-1.2">1.2.  Syntax Notation</h3>
   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5234">RFC5234</a>], extended with the notation for case-
   sensitivity in strings defined in [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7405">RFC7405</a>].

   It also uses a list extension, defined in Section 5.6.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>],
   that allows for compact definition of comma-separated lists using a
   "#" operator (similar to how the "*" operator indicates repetition).
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> shows the collected grammar with all list operators
   expanded to standard ABNF notation.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-1.2.1">1.2.1.  Imported Rules</h4>
   The following core rule is included by reference, as defined in
   <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5234#appendix-B.1">[RFC5234], Appendix B.1</a>: DIGIT (decimal 0-9).

   [<a id="ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>] defines the following rules:

     HTTP-date     = &lt;HTTP-date, see [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>], Section 5.6.7&gt;
     OWS           = &lt;OWS, see [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>], Section 5.6.3&gt;
     field-name    = &lt;field-name, see [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>], Section 5.1&gt;
     quoted-string = &lt;quoted-string, see [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>], Section 5.6.4&gt;
     token         = &lt;token, see [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>], Section 5.6.2&gt;

<h4 class="h4" id="section-1.2.2">1.2.2.  Delta Seconds</h4>
   The delta-seconds rule specifies a non-negative integer, representing
   time in seconds.

     delta-seconds  = 1*DIGIT

   A recipient parsing a delta-seconds value and converting it to binary
   form ought to use an arithmetic type of at least 31 bits of non-
   negative integer range.  If a cache receives a delta-seconds value
   greater than the greatest integer it can represent, or if any of its
   subsequent calculations overflows, the cache MUST consider the value
   to be 2147483648 (2^31) or the greatest positive integer it can
   conveniently represent.

      |  *Note:* The value 2147483648 is here for historical reasons,
      |  represents infinity (over 68 years), and does not need to be
      |  stored in binary form; an implementation could produce it as a
      |  string if any overflow occurs, even if the calculations are
      |  performed with an arithmetic type incapable of directly
      |  representing that number.  What matters here is that an
      |  overflow be detected and not treated as a negative value in
      |  later calculations.

<h2 class="h2" id="section-2">2.  Overview of Cache Operation</h2>
   Proper cache operation preserves the semantics of HTTP transfers
   while reducing the transmission of information already held in the
   cache.  See Section 3 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>] for the general terminology and core
   concepts of HTTP.

   Although caching is an entirely OPTIONAL feature of HTTP, it can be
   assumed that reusing a cached response is desirable and that such
   reuse is the default behavior when no requirement or local
   configuration prevents it.  Therefore, HTTP cache requirements are
   focused on preventing a cache from either storing a non-reusable
   response or reusing a stored response inappropriately, rather than
   mandating that caches always store and reuse particular responses.

   The "cache key" is the information a cache uses to choose a response
   and is composed from, at a minimum, the request method and target URI
   used to retrieve the stored response; the method determines under
   which circumstances that response can be used to satisfy a subsequent
   request.  However, many HTTP caches in common use today only cache
   GET responses and therefore only use the URI as the cache key.

   A cache might store multiple responses for a request target that is
   subject to content negotiation.  Caches differentiate these responses
   by incorporating some of the original request's header fields into
   the cache key as well, using information in the Vary response header
   field, as per <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   Caches might incorporate additional material into the cache key.  For
   example, user agent caches might include the referring site's
   identity, thereby "double keying" the cache to avoid some privacy
   risks (see <a href="#section-7.2">Section 7.2</a>).

   Most commonly, caches store the successful result of a retrieval
   request: i.e., a 200 (OK) response to a GET request, which contains a
   representation of the target resource (Section 9.3.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]).
   However, it is also possible to store redirects, negative results
   (e.g., 404 (Not Found)), incomplete results (e.g., 206 (Partial
   Content)), and responses to methods other than GET if the method's
   definition allows such caching and defines something suitable for use
   as a cache key.

   A cache is "disconnected" when it cannot contact the origin server or
   otherwise find a forward path for a request.  A disconnected cache
   can serve stale responses in some circumstances (<a href="#section-4.2.4">Section 4.2.4</a>).

<h2 class="h2" id="section-3">3.  Storing Responses in Caches</h2>
   A cache MUST NOT store a response to a request unless:

   *  the request method is understood by the cache;

   *  the response status code is final (see Section 15 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]);

   *  if the response status code is 206 or 304, or the must-understand
      cache directive (see <a href="#section-5.2.2.3">Section 5.2.2.3</a>) is present: the cache
      understands the response status code;

   *  the no-store cache directive is not present in the response (see
      <a href="#section-5.2.2.5">Section 5.2.2.5</a>);

   *  if the cache is shared: the private response directive is either
      not present or allows a shared cache to store a modified response;
      see <a href="#section-5.2.2.7">Section 5.2.2.7</a>);

   *  if the cache is shared: the Authorization header field is not
      present in the request (see Section 11.6.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) or a
      response directive is present that explicitly allows shared
      caching (see <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>); and

   *  the response contains at least one of the following:

      -  a public response directive (see <a href="#section-5.2.2.9">Section 5.2.2.9</a>);

      -  a private response directive, if the cache is not shared (see
         <a href="#section-5.2.2.7">Section 5.2.2.7</a>);

      -  an Expires header field (see <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>);

      -  a max-age response directive (see <a href="#section-5.2.2.1">Section 5.2.2.1</a>);

      -  if the cache is shared: an s-maxage response directive (see
         <a href="#section-5.2.2.10">Section 5.2.2.10</a>);

      -  a cache extension that allows it to be cached (see
         <a href="#section-5.2.3">Section 5.2.3</a>); or

      -  a status code that is defined as heuristically cacheable (see
         <a href="#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2</a>).

   Note that a cache extension can override any of the requirements
   listed; see <a href="#section-5.2.3">Section 5.2.3</a>.

   In this context, a cache has "understood" a request method or a
   response status code if it recognizes it and implements all specified
   caching-related behavior.

   Note that, in normal operation, some caches will not store a response
   that has neither a cache validator nor an explicit expiration time,
   as such responses are not usually useful to store.  However, caches
   are not prohibited from storing such responses.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-3.1">3.1.  Storing Header and Trailer Fields</h3>
   Caches MUST include all received response header fields -- including
   unrecognized ones -- when storing a response; this assures that new
   HTTP header fields can be successfully deployed.  However, the
   following exceptions are made:

   *  The Connection header field and fields whose names are listed in
      it are required by Section 7.6.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>] to be removed before
      forwarding the message.  This MAY be implemented by doing so
      before storage.

   *  Likewise, some fields' semantics require them to be removed before
      forwarding the message, and this MAY be implemented by doing so
      before storage; see Section 7.6.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>] for some examples.

   *  The no-cache (<a href="#section-5.2.2.4">Section 5.2.2.4</a>) and private (<a href="#section-5.2.2.7">Section 5.2.2.7</a>) cache
      directives can have arguments that prevent storage of header
      fields by all caches and shared caches, respectively.

   *  Header fields that are specific to the proxy that a cache uses
      when forwarding a request MUST NOT be stored, unless the cache
      incorporates the identity of the proxy into the cache key.
      Effectively, this is limited to Proxy-Authenticate (Section 11.7.1
      of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]), Proxy-Authentication-Info (<a href="#section-11.7.3">Section 11.7.3</a> of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]),
      and Proxy-Authorization (Section 11.7.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]).

   Caches MAY either store trailer fields separate from header fields or
   discard them.  Caches MUST NOT combine trailer fields with header
   fields.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-3.2">3.2.  Updating Stored Header Fields</h3>
   Caches are required to update a stored response's header fields from
   another (typically newer) response in several situations; for
   example, see Sections <a href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>, <a href="#section-4.3.4">4.3.4</a>, and <a href="#section-4.3.5">4.3.5</a>.

   When doing so, the cache MUST add each header field in the provided
   response to the stored response, replacing field values that are
   already present, with the following exceptions:

   *  Header fields excepted from storage in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>,

   *  Header fields that the cache's stored response depends upon, as
      described below,

   *  Header fields that are automatically processed and removed by the
      recipient, as described below, and

   *  The Content-Length header field.

   In some cases, caches (especially in user agents) store the results
   of processing the received response, rather than the response itself,
   and updating header fields that affect that processing can result in
   inconsistent behavior and security issues.  Caches in this situation
   MAY omit these header fields from updating stored responses on an
   exceptional basis but SHOULD limit such omission to those fields
   necessary to assure integrity of the stored response.

   For example, a browser might decode the content coding of a response
   while it is being received, creating a disconnect between the data it
   has stored and the response's original metadata.  Updating that
   stored metadata with a different Content-Encoding header field would
   be problematic.  Likewise, a browser might store a post-parse HTML
   tree rather than the content received in the response; updating the
   Content-Type header field would not be workable in this case because
   any assumptions about the format made in parsing would now be
   invalid.

   Furthermore, some fields are automatically processed and removed by
   the HTTP implementation, such as the Content-Range header field.
   Implementations MAY automatically omit such header fields from
   updates, even when the processing does not actually occur.

   Note that the Content-* prefix is not a signal that a header field is
   omitted from update; it is a convention for MIME header fields, not
   HTTP.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-3.3">3.3.  Storing Incomplete Responses</h3>
   If the request method is GET, the response status code is 200 (OK),
   and the entire response header section has been received, a cache MAY
   store a response that is not complete (Section 6.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>])
   provided that the stored response is recorded as being incomplete.
   Likewise, a 206 (Partial Content) response MAY be stored as if it
   were an incomplete 200 (OK) response.  However, a cache MUST NOT
   store incomplete or partial-content responses if it does not support
   the Range and Content-Range header fields or if it does not
   understand the range units used in those fields.

   A cache MAY complete a stored incomplete response by making a
   subsequent range request (Section 14.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) and combining the
   successful response with the stored response, as defined in
   <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.  A cache MUST NOT use an incomplete response to answer
   requests unless the response has been made complete, or the request
   is partial and specifies a range wholly within the incomplete
   response.  A cache MUST NOT send a partial response to a client
   without explicitly marking it using the 206 (Partial Content) status
   code.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-3.4">3.4.  Combining Partial Content</h3>
   A response might transfer only a partial representation if the
   connection closed prematurely or if the request used one or more
   Range specifiers (Section 14.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]).  After several such
   transfers, a cache might have received several ranges of the same
   representation.  A cache MAY combine these ranges into a single
   stored response, and reuse that response to satisfy later requests,
   if they all share the same strong validator and the cache complies
   with the client requirements in Section 15.3.7.3 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>].

   When combining the new response with one or more stored responses, a
   cache MUST update the stored response header fields using the header
   fields provided in the new response, as per <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-3.5">3.5.  Storing Responses to Authenticated Requests</h3>
   A shared cache MUST NOT use a cached response to a request with an
   Authorization header field (Section 11.6.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) to satisfy any
   subsequent request unless the response contains a Cache-Control field
   with a response directive (<a href="#section-5.2.2">Section 5.2.2</a>) that allows it to be stored
   by a shared cache, and the cache conforms to the requirements of that
   directive for that response.

   In this specification, the following response directives have such an
   effect: must-revalidate (<a href="#section-5.2.2.2">Section 5.2.2.2</a>), public (<a href="#section-5.2.2.9">Section 5.2.2.9</a>),
   and s-maxage (<a href="#section-5.2.2.10">Section 5.2.2.10</a>).

<h2 class="h2" id="section-4">4.  Constructing Responses from Caches</h2>
   When presented with a request, a cache MUST NOT reuse a stored
   response unless:

   *  the presented target URI (Section 7.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) and that of the
      stored response match, and

   *  the request method associated with the stored response allows it
      to be used for the presented request, and

   *  request header fields nominated by the stored response (if any)
      match those presented (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>), and

   *  the stored response does not contain the no-cache directive
      (<a href="#section-5.2.2.4">Section 5.2.2.4</a>), unless it is successfully validated
      (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>), and

   *  the stored response is one of the following:

      -  fresh (see <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>), or

      -  allowed to be served stale (see <a href="#section-4.2.4">Section 4.2.4</a>), or

      -  successfully validated (see <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>).

   Note that a cache extension can override any of the requirements
   listed; see <a href="#section-5.2.3">Section 5.2.3</a>.

   When a stored response is used to satisfy a request without
   validation, a cache MUST generate an Age header field (<a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>),
   replacing any present in the response with a value equal to the
   stored response's current_age; see <a href="#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3</a>.

   A cache MUST write through requests with methods that are unsafe
   (Section 9.2.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) to the origin server; i.e., a cache is not
   allowed to generate a reply to such a request before having forwarded
   the request and having received a corresponding response.

   Also, note that unsafe requests might invalidate already-stored
   responses; see <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>.

   A cache can use a response that is stored or storable to satisfy
   multiple requests, provided that it is allowed to reuse that response
   for the requests in question.  This enables a cache to "collapse
   requests" -- or combine multiple incoming requests into a single
   forward request upon a cache miss -- thereby reducing load on the
   origin server and network.  Note, however, that if the cache cannot
   use the returned response for some or all of the collapsed requests,
   it will need to forward the requests in order to satisfy them,
   potentially introducing additional latency.

   When more than one suitable response is stored, a cache MUST use the
   most recent one (as determined by the Date header field).  It can
   also forward the request with "Cache-Control: max-age=0" or "Cache-
   Control: no-cache" to disambiguate which response to use.

   A cache without a clock (Section 5.6.7 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) MUST revalidate
   stored responses upon every use.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-4.1">4.1.  Calculating Cache Keys with the Vary Header Field</h3>
   When a cache receives a request that can be satisfied by a stored
   response and that stored response contains a Vary header field
   (Section 12.5.5 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]), the cache MUST NOT use that stored
   response without revalidation unless all the presented request header
   fields nominated by that Vary field value match those fields in the
   original request (i.e., the request that caused the cached response
   to be stored).

   The header fields from two requests are defined to match if and only
   if those in the first request can be transformed to those in the
   second request by applying any of the following:

   *  adding or removing whitespace, where allowed in the header field's
      syntax

   *  combining multiple header field lines with the same field name
      (see Section 5.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>])

   *  normalizing both header field values in a way that is known to
      have identical semantics, according to the header field's
      specification (e.g., reordering field values when order is not
      significant; case-normalization, where values are defined to be
      case-insensitive)

   If (after any normalization that might take place) a header field is
   absent from a request, it can only match another request if it is
   also absent there.

   A stored response with a Vary header field value containing a member
   "*" always fails to match.

   If multiple stored responses match, the cache will need to choose one
   to use.  When a nominated request header field has a known mechanism
   for ranking preference (e.g., qvalues on Accept and similar request
   header fields), that mechanism MAY be used to choose a preferred
   response.  If such a mechanism is not available, or leads to equally
   preferred responses, the most recent response (as determined by the
   Date header field) is chosen, as per <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   Some resources mistakenly omit the Vary header field from their
   default response (i.e., the one sent when the request does not
   express any preferences), with the effect of choosing it for
   subsequent requests to that resource even when more preferable
   responses are available.  When a cache has multiple stored responses
   for a target URI and one or more omits the Vary header field, the
   cache SHOULD choose the most recent (see <a href="#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3</a>) stored
   response with a valid Vary field value.

   If no stored response matches, the cache cannot satisfy the presented
   request.  Typically, the request is forwarded to the origin server,
   potentially with preconditions added to describe what responses the
   cache has already stored (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>).

<h3 class="h3" id="section-4.2">4.2.  Freshness</h3>
   A "fresh" response is one whose age has not yet exceeded its
   freshness lifetime.  Conversely, a "stale" response is one where it
   has.

   A response's "freshness lifetime" is the length of time between its
   generation by the origin server and its expiration time.  An
   "explicit expiration time" is the time at which the origin server
   intends that a stored response can no longer be used by a cache
   without further validation, whereas a "heuristic expiration time" is
   assigned by a cache when no explicit expiration time is available.

   A response's "age" is the time that has passed since it was generated
   by, or successfully validated with, the origin server.

   When a response is fresh, it can be used to satisfy subsequent
   requests without contacting the origin server, thereby improving
   efficiency.

   The primary mechanism for determining freshness is for an origin
   server to provide an explicit expiration time in the future, using
   either the Expires header field (<a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>) or the max-age response
   directive (<a href="#section-5.2.2.1">Section 5.2.2.1</a>).  Generally, origin servers will assign
   future explicit expiration times to responses in the belief that the
   representation is not likely to change in a semantically significant
   way before the expiration time is reached.

   If an origin server wishes to force a cache to validate every
   request, it can assign an explicit expiration time in the past to
   indicate that the response is already stale.  Compliant caches will
   normally validate a stale cached response before reusing it for
   subsequent requests (see <a href="#section-4.2.4">Section 4.2.4</a>).

   Since origin servers do not always provide explicit expiration times,
   caches are also allowed to use a heuristic to determine an expiration
   time under certain circumstances (see <a href="#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2</a>).

   The calculation to determine if a response is fresh is:

      response_is_fresh = (freshness_lifetime &gt; current_age)

   freshness_lifetime is defined in <a href="#section-4.2.1">Section 4.2.1</a>; current_age is
   defined in <a href="#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3</a>.

   Clients can send the max-age or min-fresh request directives
   (<a href="#section-5.2.1">Section 5.2.1</a>) to suggest limits on the freshness calculations for
   the corresponding response.  However, caches are not required to
   honor them.

   When calculating freshness, to avoid common problems in date parsing:

   *  Although all date formats are specified to be case-sensitive, a
      cache recipient SHOULD match the field value case-insensitively.

   *  If a cache recipient's internal implementation of time has less
      resolution than the value of an HTTP-date, the recipient MUST
      internally represent a parsed Expires date as the nearest time
      equal to or earlier than the received value.

   *  A cache recipient MUST NOT allow local time zones to influence the
      calculation or comparison of an age or expiration time.

   *  A cache recipient SHOULD consider a date with a zone abbreviation
      other than "GMT" to be invalid for calculating expiration.

   Note that freshness applies only to cache operation; it cannot be
   used to force a user agent to refresh its display or reload a
   resource.  See <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> for an explanation of the difference between
   caches and history mechanisms.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-4.2.1">4.2.1.  Calculating Freshness Lifetime</h4>
   A cache can calculate the freshness lifetime (denoted as
   freshness_lifetime) of a response by evaluating the following rules
   and using the first match:

   *  If the cache is shared and the s-maxage response directive
      (<a href="#section-5.2.2.10">Section 5.2.2.10</a>) is present, use its value, or

   *  If the max-age response directive (<a href="#section-5.2.2.1">Section 5.2.2.1</a>) is present,
      use its value, or

   *  If the Expires response header field (<a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>) is present, use
      its value minus the value of the Date response header field (using
      the time the message was received if it is not present, as per
      Section 6.6.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]), or

   *  Otherwise, no explicit expiration time is present in the response.
      A heuristic freshness lifetime might be applicable; see
      <a href="#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2</a>.

   Note that this calculation is intended to reduce clock skew by using
   the clock information provided by the origin server whenever
   possible.

   When there is more than one value present for a given directive
   (e.g., two Expires header field lines or multiple Cache-Control: max-
   age directives), either the first occurrence should be used or the
   response should be considered stale.  If directives conflict (e.g.,
   both max-age and no-cache are present), the most restrictive
   directive should be honored.  Caches are encouraged to consider
   responses that have invalid freshness information (e.g., a max-age
   directive with non-integer content) to be stale.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-4.2.2">4.2.2.  Calculating Heuristic Freshness</h4>
   Since origin servers do not always provide explicit expiration times,
   a cache MAY assign a heuristic expiration time when an explicit time
   is not specified, employing algorithms that use other field values
   (such as the Last-Modified time) to estimate a plausible expiration
   time.  This specification does not provide specific algorithms, but
   it does impose worst-case constraints on their results.

   A cache MUST NOT use heuristics to determine freshness when an
   explicit expiration time is present in the stored response.  Because
   of the requirements in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, heuristics can only be used on
   responses without explicit freshness whose status codes are defined
   as "heuristically cacheable" (e.g., see Section 15.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) and
   on responses without explicit freshness that have been marked as
   explicitly cacheable (e.g., with a public response directive).

   Note that in previous specifications, heuristically cacheable
   response status codes were called "cacheable by default".

   If the response has a Last-Modified header field (Section 8.8.2 of
   [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]), caches are encouraged to use a heuristic expiration value
   that is no more than some fraction of the interval since that time.
   A typical setting of this fraction might be 10%.

      |  *Note:* A previous version of the HTTP specification
      |  (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13.9">Section 13.9 of [RFC2616]</a>) prohibited caches from calculating
      |  heuristic freshness for URIs with query components (i.e., those
      |  containing "?").  In practice, this has not been widely
      |  implemented.  Therefore, origin servers are encouraged to send
      |  explicit directives (e.g., Cache-Control: no-cache) if they
      |  wish to prevent caching.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-4.2.3">4.2.3.  Calculating Age</h4>
   The Age header field is used to convey an estimated age of the
   response message when obtained from a cache.  The Age field value is
   the cache's estimate of the number of seconds since the origin server
   generated or validated the response.  The Age value is therefore the
   sum of the time that the response has been resident in each of the
   caches along the path from the origin server, plus the time it has
   been in transit along network paths.

   Age calculation uses the following data:

   "age_value"
      The term "age_value" denotes the value of the Age header field
      (<a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>), in a form appropriate for arithmetic operation; or
      0, if not available.

   "date_value"
      The term "date_value" denotes the value of the Date header field,
      in a form appropriate for arithmetic operations.  See
      Section 6.6.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>] for the definition of the Date header
      field and for requirements regarding responses without it.

   "now"
      The term "now" means the current value of this implementation's
      clock (Section 5.6.7 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]).

   "request_time"
      The value of the clock at the time of the request that resulted in
      the stored response.

   "response_time"
      The value of the clock at the time the response was received.

   A response's age can be calculated in two entirely independent ways:

   1.  the "apparent_age": response_time minus date_value, if the
       implementation's clock is reasonably well synchronized to the
       origin server's clock.  If the result is negative, the result is
       replaced by zero.

   2.  the "corrected_age_value", if all of the caches along the
       response path implement HTTP/1.1 or greater.  A cache MUST
       interpret this value relative to the time the request was
       initiated, not the time that the response was received.

     apparent_age = max(0, response_time - date_value);

     response_delay = response_time - request_time;
     corrected_age_value = age_value + response_delay;

   The corrected_age_value MAY be used as the corrected_initial_age.  In
   circumstances where very old cache implementations that might not
   correctly insert Age are present, corrected_initial_age can be
   calculated more conservatively as

     corrected_initial_age = max(apparent_age, corrected_age_value);

   The current_age of a stored response can then be calculated by adding
   the time (in seconds) since the stored response was last validated by
   the origin server to the corrected_initial_age.

     resident_time = now - response_time;
     current_age = corrected_initial_age + resident_time;

<h4 class="h4" id="section-4.2.4">4.2.4.  Serving Stale Responses</h4>
   A "stale" response is one that either has explicit expiry information
   or is allowed to have heuristic expiry calculated, but is not fresh
   according to the calculations in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.

   A cache MUST NOT generate a stale response if it is prohibited by an
   explicit in-protocol directive (e.g., by a no-cache response
   directive, a must-revalidate response directive, or an applicable
   s-maxage or proxy-revalidate response directive; see <a href="#section-5.2.2">Section 5.2.2</a>).

   A cache MUST NOT generate a stale response unless it is disconnected
   or doing so is explicitly permitted by the client or origin server
   (e.g., by the max-stale request directive in <a href="#section-5.2.1">Section 5.2.1</a>, extension
   directives such as those defined in [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5861">RFC5861</a>], or configuration in
   accordance with an out-of-band contract).

<h3 class="h3" id="section-4.3">4.3.  Validation</h3>
   When a cache has one or more stored responses for a requested URI,
   but cannot serve any of them (e.g., because they are not fresh, or
   one cannot be chosen; see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>), it can use the conditional
   request mechanism (Section 13 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) in the forwarded request to
   give the next inbound server an opportunity to choose a valid stored
   response to use, updating the stored metadata in the process, or to
   replace the stored response(s) with a new response.  This process is
   known as "validating" or "revalidating" the stored response.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-4.3.1">4.3.1.  Sending a Validation Request</h4>
   When generating a conditional request for validation, a cache either
   starts with a request it is attempting to satisfy or -- if it is
   initiating the request independently -- synthesizes a request using a
   stored response by copying the method, target URI, and request header
   fields identified by the Vary header field (<a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>).

   It then updates that request with one or more precondition header
   fields.  These contain validator metadata sourced from a stored
   response(s) that has the same URI.  Typically, this will include only
   the stored response(s) that has the same cache key, although a cache
   is allowed to validate a response that it cannot choose with the
   request header fields it is sending (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>).

   The precondition header fields are then compared by recipients to
   determine whether any stored response is equivalent to a current
   representation of the resource.

   One such validator is the timestamp given in a Last-Modified header
   field (Section 8.8.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]), which can be used in an If-Modified-
   Since header field for response validation, or in an If-Unmodified-
   Since or If-Range header field for representation selection (i.e.,
   the client is referring specifically to a previously obtained
   representation with that timestamp).

   Another validator is the entity tag given in an ETag field
   (Section 8.8.3 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]).  One or more entity tags, indicating one
   or more stored responses, can be used in an If-None-Match header
   field for response validation, or in an If-Match or If-Range header
   field for representation selection (i.e., the client is referring
   specifically to one or more previously obtained representations with
   the listed entity tags).

   When generating a conditional request for validation, a cache:

   *  MUST send the relevant entity tags (using If-Match, If-None-Match,
      or If-Range) if the entity tags were provided in the stored
      response(s) being validated.

   *  SHOULD send the Last-Modified value (using If-Modified-Since) if
      the request is not for a subrange, a single stored response is
      being validated, and that response contains a Last-Modified value.

   *  MAY send the Last-Modified value (using If-Unmodified-Since or If-
      Range) if the request is for a subrange, a single stored response
      is being validated, and that response contains only a Last-
      Modified value (not an entity tag).

   In most cases, both validators are generated in cache validation
   requests, even when entity tags are clearly superior, to allow old
   intermediaries that do not understand entity tag preconditions to
   respond appropriately.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-4.3.2">4.3.2.  Handling a Received Validation Request</h4>
   Each client in the request chain may have its own cache, so it is
   common for a cache at an intermediary to receive conditional requests
   from other (outbound) caches.  Likewise, some user agents make use of
   conditional requests to limit data transfers to recently modified
   representations or to complete the transfer of a partially retrieved
   representation.

   If a cache receives a request that can be satisfied by reusing a
   stored 200 (OK) or 206 (Partial Content) response, as per <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>,
   the cache SHOULD evaluate any applicable conditional header field
   preconditions received in that request with respect to the
   corresponding validators contained within the stored response.

   A cache MUST NOT evaluate conditional header fields that only apply
   to an origin server, occur in a request with semantics that cannot be
   satisfied with a cached response, or occur in a request with a target
   resource for which it has no stored responses; such preconditions are
   likely intended for some other (inbound) server.

   The proper evaluation of conditional requests by a cache depends on
   the received precondition header fields and their precedence.  In
   summary, the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since conditional header
   fields are not applicable to a cache, and If-None-Match takes
   precedence over If-Modified-Since.  See Section 13.2.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>] for
   a complete specification of precondition precedence.

   A request containing an If-None-Match header field (Section 13.1.2 of
   [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) indicates that the client wants to validate one or more of
   its own stored responses in comparison to the stored response chosen
   by the cache (as per <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).

   If an If-None-Match header field is not present, a request containing
   an If-Modified-Since header field (Section 13.1.3 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>])
   indicates that the client wants to validate one or more of its own
   stored responses by modification date.

   If a request contains an If-Modified-Since header field and the Last-
   Modified header field is not present in a stored response, a cache
   SHOULD use the stored response's Date field value (or, if no Date
   field is present, the time that the stored response was received) to
   evaluate the conditional.

   A cache that implements partial responses to range requests, as
   defined in Section 14.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>], also needs to evaluate a received
   If-Range header field (Section 13.1.5 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) with respect to the
   cache's chosen response.

   When a cache decides to forward a request to revalidate its own
   stored responses for a request that contains an If-None-Match list of
   entity tags, the cache MAY combine the received list with a list of
   entity tags from its own stored set of responses (fresh or stale) and
   send the union of the two lists as a replacement If-None-Match header
   field value in the forwarded request.  If a stored response contains
   only partial content, the cache MUST NOT include its entity tag in
   the union unless the request is for a range that would be fully
   satisfied by that partial stored response.  If the response to the
   forwarded request is 304 (Not Modified) and has an ETag field value
   with an entity tag that is not in the client's list, the cache MUST
   generate a 200 (OK) response for the client by reusing its
   corresponding stored response, as updated by the 304 response
   metadata (<a href="#section-4.3.4">Section 4.3.4</a>).

<h4 class="h4" id="section-4.3.3">4.3.3.  Handling a Validation Response</h4>
   Cache handling of a response to a conditional request depends upon
   its status code:

   *  A 304 (Not Modified) response status code indicates that the
      stored response can be updated and reused; see <a href="#section-4.3.4">Section 4.3.4</a>.

   *  A full response (i.e., one containing content) indicates that none
      of the stored responses nominated in the conditional request are
      suitable.  Instead, the cache MUST use the full response to
      satisfy the request.  The cache MAY store such a full response,
      subject to its constraints (see <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).

   *  However, if a cache receives a 5xx (Server Error) response while
      attempting to validate a response, it can either forward this
      response to the requesting client or act as if the server failed
      to respond.  In the latter case, the cache can send a previously
      stored response, subject to its constraints on doing so (see
      <a href="#section-4.2.4">Section 4.2.4</a>), or retry the validation request.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-4.3.4">4.3.4.  Freshening Stored Responses upon Validation</h4>
   When a cache receives a 304 (Not Modified) response, it needs to
   identify stored responses that are suitable for updating with the new
   information provided, and then do so.

   The initial set of stored responses to update are those that could
   have been chosen for that request -- i.e., those that meet the
   requirements in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>, except the last requirement to be fresh,
   able to be served stale, or just validated.

   Then, that initial set of stored responses is further filtered by the
   first match of:

   *  If the new response contains one or more "strong validators" (see
      Section 8.8.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]), then each of those strong validators
      identifies a selected representation for update.  All the stored
      responses in the initial set with one of those same strong
      validators are identified for update.  If none of the initial set
      contains at least one of the same strong validators, then the
      cache MUST NOT use the new response to update any stored
      responses.

   *  If the new response contains no strong validators but does contain
      one or more "weak validators", and those validators correspond to
      one of the initial set's stored responses, then the most recent of
      those matching stored responses is identified for update.

   *  If the new response does not include any form of validator (such
      as where a client generates an If-Modified-Since request from a
      source other than the Last-Modified response header field), and
      there is only one stored response in the initial set, and that
      stored response also lacks a validator, then that stored response
      is identified for update.

   For each stored response identified, the cache MUST update its header
   fields with the header fields provided in the 304 (Not Modified)
   response, as per <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-4.3.5">4.3.5.  Freshening Responses with HEAD</h4>
   A response to the HEAD method is identical to what an equivalent
   request made with a GET would have been, without sending the content.
   This property of HEAD responses can be used to invalidate or update a
   cached GET response if the more efficient conditional GET request
   mechanism is not available (due to no validators being present in the
   stored response) or if transmission of the content is not desired
   even if it has changed.

   When a cache makes an inbound HEAD request for a target URI and
   receives a 200 (OK) response, the cache SHOULD update or invalidate
   each of its stored GET responses that could have been chosen for that
   request (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>).

   For each of the stored responses that could have been chosen, if the
   stored response and HEAD response have matching values for any
   received validator fields (ETag and Last-Modified) and, if the HEAD
   response has a Content-Length header field, the value of Content-
   Length matches that of the stored response, the cache SHOULD update
   the stored response as described below; otherwise, the cache SHOULD
   consider the stored response to be stale.

   If a cache updates a stored response with the metadata provided in a
   HEAD response, the cache MUST use the header fields provided in the
   HEAD response to update the stored response (see <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).

<h3 class="h3" id="section-4.4">4.4.  Invalidating Stored Responses</h3>
   Because unsafe request methods (Section 9.2.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) such as PUT,
   POST, or DELETE have the potential for changing state on the origin
   server, intervening caches are required to invalidate stored
   responses to keep their contents up to date.

   A cache MUST invalidate the target URI (Section 7.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) when
   it receives a non-error status code in response to an unsafe request
   method (including methods whose safety is unknown).

   A cache MAY invalidate other URIs when it receives a non-error status
   code in response to an unsafe request method (including methods whose
   safety is unknown).  In particular, the URI(s) in the Location and
   Content-Location response header fields (if present) are candidates
   for invalidation; other URIs might be discovered through mechanisms
   not specified in this document.  However, a cache MUST NOT trigger an
   invalidation under these conditions if the origin (Section 4.3.1 of
   [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) of the URI to be invalidated differs from that of the target
   URI (Section 7.1 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]).  This helps prevent denial-of-service
   attacks.

   "Invalidate" means that the cache will either remove all stored
   responses whose target URI matches the given URI or mark them as
   "invalid" and in need of a mandatory validation before they can be
   sent in response to a subsequent request.

   A "non-error response" is one with a 2xx (Successful) or 3xx
   (Redirection) status code.

   Note that this does not guarantee that all appropriate responses are
   invalidated globally; a state-changing request would only invalidate
   responses in the caches it travels through.

<h2 class="h2" id="section-5">5.  Field Definitions</h2>
   This section defines the syntax and semantics of HTTP fields related
   to caching.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-5.1">5.1.  Age</h3>
   The "Age" response header field conveys the sender's estimate of the
   time since the response was generated or successfully validated at
   the origin server.  Age values are calculated as specified in
   <a href="#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3</a>.

     Age = delta-seconds

   The Age field value is a non-negative integer, representing time in
   seconds (see <a href="#section-1.2.2">Section 1.2.2</a>).

   Although it is defined as a singleton header field, a cache
   encountering a message with a list-based Age field value SHOULD use
   the first member of the field value, discarding subsequent ones.

   If the field value (after discarding additional members, as per
   above) is invalid (e.g., it contains something other than a non-
   negative integer), a cache SHOULD ignore the field.

   The presence of an Age header field implies that the response was not
   generated or validated by the origin server for this request.
   However, lack of an Age header field does not imply the origin was
   contacted.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-5.2">5.2.  Cache-Control</h3>
   The "Cache-Control" header field is used to list directives for
   caches along the request/response chain.  Cache directives are
   unidirectional, in that the presence of a directive in a request does
   not imply that the same directive is present or copied in the
   response.

   See <a href="#section-5.2.3">Section 5.2.3</a> for information about how Cache-Control directives
   defined elsewhere are handled.

   A proxy, whether or not it implements a cache, MUST pass cache
   directives through in forwarded messages, regardless of their
   significance to that application, since the directives might apply to
   all recipients along the request/response chain.  It is not possible
   to target a directive to a specific cache.

   Cache directives are identified by a token, to be compared case-
   insensitively, and have an optional argument that can use both token
   and quoted-string syntax.  For the directives defined below that
   define arguments, recipients ought to accept both forms, even if a
   specific form is required for generation.

     Cache-Control   = #cache-directive

     cache-directive = token [ "=" ( token / quoted-string ) ]

   For the cache directives defined below, no argument is defined (nor
   allowed) unless stated otherwise.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-5.2.1">5.2.1.  Request Directives</h4>
   This section defines cache request directives.  They are advisory;
   caches MAY implement them, but are not required to.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.1.1">5.2.1.1.  max-age</h5>
   Argument syntax:

      delta-seconds (see <a href="#section-1.2.2">Section 1.2.2</a>)

   The max-age request directive indicates that the client prefers a
   response whose age is less than or equal to the specified number of
   seconds.  Unless the max-stale request directive is also present, the
   client does not wish to receive a stale response.

   This directive uses the token form of the argument syntax: e.g.,
   'max-age=5' not 'max-age="5"'.  A sender MUST NOT generate the
   quoted-string form.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.1.2">5.2.1.2.  max-stale</h5>
   Argument syntax:

      delta-seconds (see <a href="#section-1.2.2">Section 1.2.2</a>)

   The max-stale request directive indicates that the client will accept
   a response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime.  If a value is
   present, then the client is willing to accept a response that has
   exceeded its freshness lifetime by no more than the specified number
   of seconds.  If no value is assigned to max-stale, then the client
   will accept a stale response of any age.

   This directive uses the token form of the argument syntax: e.g.,
   'max-stale=10' not 'max-stale="10"'.  A sender MUST NOT generate the
   quoted-string form.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.1.3">5.2.1.3.  min-fresh</h5>
   Argument syntax:

      delta-seconds (see <a href="#section-1.2.2">Section 1.2.2</a>)

   The min-fresh request directive indicates that the client prefers a
   response whose freshness lifetime is no less than its current age
   plus the specified time in seconds.  That is, the client wants a
   response that will still be fresh for at least the specified number
   of seconds.

   This directive uses the token form of the argument syntax: e.g.,
   'min-fresh=20' not 'min-fresh="20"'.  A sender MUST NOT generate the
   quoted-string form.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.1.4">5.2.1.4.  no-cache</h5>
   The no-cache request directive indicates that the client prefers a
   stored response not be used to satisfy the request without successful
   validation on the origin server.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.1.5">5.2.1.5.  no-store</h5>
   The no-store request directive indicates that a cache MUST NOT store
   any part of either this request or any response to it.  This
   directive applies to both private and shared caches.  "MUST NOT
   store" in this context means that the cache MUST NOT intentionally
   store the information in non-volatile storage and MUST make a best-
   effort attempt to remove the information from volatile storage as
   promptly as possible after forwarding it.

   This directive is not a reliable or sufficient mechanism for ensuring
   privacy.  In particular, malicious or compromised caches might not
   recognize or obey this directive, and communications networks might
   be vulnerable to eavesdropping.

   Note that if a request containing this directive is satisfied from a
   cache, the no-store request directive does not apply to the already
   stored response.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.1.6">5.2.1.6.  no-transform</h5>
   The no-transform request directive indicates that the client is
   asking for intermediaries to avoid transforming the content, as
   defined in Section 7.7 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>].

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.1.7">5.2.1.7.  only-if-cached</h5>
   The only-if-cached request directive indicates that the client only
   wishes to obtain a stored response.  Caches that honor this request
   directive SHOULD, upon receiving it, respond with either a stored
   response consistent with the other constraints of the request or a
   504 (Gateway Timeout) status code.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-5.2.2">5.2.2.  Response Directives</h4>
   This section defines cache response directives.  A cache MUST obey
   the Cache-Control directives defined in this section.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.2.1">5.2.2.1.  max-age</h5>
   Argument syntax:

      delta-seconds (see <a href="#section-1.2.2">Section 1.2.2</a>)

   The max-age response directive indicates that the response is to be
   considered stale after its age is greater than the specified number
   of seconds.

   This directive uses the token form of the argument syntax: e.g.,
   'max-age=5' not 'max-age="5"'.  A sender MUST NOT generate the
   quoted-string form.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.2.2">5.2.2.2.  must-revalidate</h5>
   The must-revalidate response directive indicates that once the
   response has become stale, a cache MUST NOT reuse that response to
   satisfy another request until it has been successfully validated by
   the origin, as defined by <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.

   The must-revalidate directive is necessary to support reliable
   operation for certain protocol features.  In all circumstances, a
   cache MUST NOT ignore the must-revalidate directive; in particular,
   if a cache is disconnected, the cache MUST generate an error response
   rather than reuse the stale response.  The generated status code
   SHOULD be 504 (Gateway Timeout) unless another error status code is
   more applicable.

   The must-revalidate directive ought to be used by servers if and only
   if failure to validate a request could cause incorrect operation,
   such as a silently unexecuted financial transaction.

   The must-revalidate directive also permits a shared cache to reuse a
   response to a request containing an Authorization header field
   (Section 11.6.2 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]), subject to the above requirement on
   revalidation (<a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>).

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.2.3">5.2.2.3.  must-understand</h5>
   The must-understand response directive limits caching of the response
   to a cache that understands and conforms to the requirements for that
   response's status code.

   A response that contains the must-understand directive SHOULD also
   contain the no-store directive.  When a cache that implements the
   must-understand directive receives a response that includes it, the
   cache SHOULD ignore the no-store directive if it understands and
   implements the status code's caching requirements.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.2.4">5.2.2.4.  no-cache</h5>
   Argument syntax:

      #field-name

   The no-cache response directive, in its unqualified form (without an
   argument), indicates that the response MUST NOT be used to satisfy
   any other request without forwarding it for validation and receiving
   a successful response; see <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.

   This allows an origin server to prevent a cache from using the
   response to satisfy a request without contacting it, even by caches
   that have been configured to send stale responses.

   The qualified form of the no-cache response directive, with an
   argument that lists one or more field names, indicates that a cache
   MAY use the response to satisfy a subsequent request, subject to any
   other restrictions on caching, if the listed header fields are
   excluded from the subsequent response or the subsequent response has
   been successfully revalidated with the origin server (updating or
   removing those fields).  This allows an origin server to prevent the
   reuse of certain header fields in a response, while still allowing
   caching of the rest of the response.

   The field names given are not limited to the set of header fields
   defined by this specification.  Field names are case-insensitive.

   This directive uses the quoted-string form of the argument syntax.  A
   sender SHOULD NOT generate the token form (even if quoting appears
   not to be needed for single-entry lists).

      |  *Note:* The qualified form of the directive is often handled by
      |  caches as if an unqualified no-cache directive was received;
      |  that is, the special handling for the qualified form is not
      |  widely implemented.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.2.5">5.2.2.5.  no-store</h5>
   The no-store response directive indicates that a cache MUST NOT store
   any part of either the immediate request or the response and MUST NOT
   use the response to satisfy any other request.

   This directive applies to both private and shared caches.  "MUST NOT
   store" in this context means that the cache MUST NOT intentionally
   store the information in non-volatile storage and MUST make a best-
   effort attempt to remove the information from volatile storage as
   promptly as possible after forwarding it.

   This directive is not a reliable or sufficient mechanism for ensuring
   privacy.  In particular, malicious or compromised caches might not
   recognize or obey this directive, and communications networks might
   be vulnerable to eavesdropping.

   Note that the must-understand cache directive overrides no-store in
   certain circumstances; see <a href="#section-5.2.2.3">Section 5.2.2.3</a>.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.2.6">5.2.2.6.  no-transform</h5>
   The no-transform response directive indicates that an intermediary
   (regardless of whether it implements a cache) MUST NOT transform the
   content, as defined in Section 7.7 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>].

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.2.7">5.2.2.7.  private</h5>
   Argument syntax:

      #field-name

   The unqualified private response directive indicates that a shared
   cache MUST NOT store the response (i.e., the response is intended for
   a single user).  It also indicates that a private cache MAY store the
   response, subject to the constraints defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, even if
   the response would not otherwise be heuristically cacheable by a
   private cache.

   If a qualified private response directive is present, with an
   argument that lists one or more field names, then only the listed
   header fields are limited to a single user: a shared cache MUST NOT
   store the listed header fields if they are present in the original
   response but MAY store the remainder of the response message without
   those header fields, subject the constraints defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   The field names given are not limited to the set of header fields
   defined by this specification.  Field names are case-insensitive.

   This directive uses the quoted-string form of the argument syntax.  A
   sender SHOULD NOT generate the token form (even if quoting appears
   not to be needed for single-entry lists).

      |  *Note:* This usage of the word "private" only controls where
      |  the response can be stored; it cannot ensure the privacy of the
      |  message content.  Also, the qualified form of the directive is
      |  often handled by caches as if an unqualified private directive
      |  was received; that is, the special handling for the qualified
      |  form is not widely implemented.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.2.8">5.2.2.8.  proxy-revalidate</h5>
   The proxy-revalidate response directive indicates that once the
   response has become stale, a shared cache MUST NOT reuse that
   response to satisfy another request until it has been successfully
   validated by the origin, as defined by <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.  This is
   analogous to must-revalidate (<a href="#section-5.2.2.2">Section 5.2.2.2</a>), except that proxy-
   revalidate does not apply to private caches.

   Note that proxy-revalidate on its own does not imply that a response
   is cacheable.  For example, it might be combined with the public
   directive (<a href="#section-5.2.2.9">Section 5.2.2.9</a>), allowing the response to be cached while
   requiring only a shared cache to revalidate when stale.

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.2.9">5.2.2.9.  public</h5>
   The public response directive indicates that a cache MAY store the
   response even if it would otherwise be prohibited, subject to the
   constraints defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  In other words, public explicitly
   marks the response as cacheable.  For example, public permits a
   shared cache to reuse a response to a request containing an
   Authorization header field (<a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>).

   Note that it is unnecessary to add the public directive to a response
   that is already cacheable according to <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   If a response with the public directive has no explicit freshness
   information, it is heuristically cacheable (<a href="#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2</a>).

<h5 class="h5" id="section-5.2.2.10">5.2.2.10.  s-maxage</h5>
   Argument syntax:

      delta-seconds (see <a href="#section-1.2.2">Section 1.2.2</a>)

   The s-maxage response directive indicates that, for a shared cache,
   the maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age
   specified by either the max-age directive or the Expires header
   field.

   The s-maxage directive incorporates the semantics of the
   proxy-revalidate response directive (<a href="#section-5.2.2.8">Section 5.2.2.8</a>) for a shared
   cache.  A shared cache MUST NOT reuse a stale response with s-maxage
   to satisfy another request until it has been successfully validated
   by the origin, as defined by <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.  This directive also
   permits a shared cache to reuse a response to a request containing an
   Authorization header field, subject to the above requirements on
   maximum age and revalidation (<a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>).

   This directive uses the token form of the argument syntax: e.g.,
   's-maxage=10' not 's-maxage="10"'.  A sender MUST NOT generate the
   quoted-string form.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-5.2.3">5.2.3.  Extension Directives</h4>
   The Cache-Control header field can be extended through the use of one
   or more extension cache directives.  A cache MUST ignore unrecognized
   cache directives.

   Informational extensions (those that do not require a change in cache
   behavior) can be added without changing the semantics of other
   directives.

   Behavioral extensions are designed to work by acting as modifiers to
   the existing base of cache directives.  Both the new directive and
   the old directive are supplied, such that applications that do not
   understand the new directive will default to the behavior specified
   by the old directive, and those that understand the new directive
   will recognize it as modifying the requirements associated with the
   old directive.  In this way, extensions to the existing cache
   directives can be made without breaking deployed caches.

   For example, consider a hypothetical new response directive called
   "community" that acts as a modifier to the private directive: in
   addition to private caches, only a cache that is shared by members of
   the named community is allowed to cache the response.  An origin
   server wishing to allow the UCI community to use an otherwise private
   response in their shared cache(s) could do so by including

   Cache-Control: private, community="UCI"

   A cache that recognizes such a community cache directive could
   broaden its behavior in accordance with that extension.  A cache that
   does not recognize the community cache directive would ignore it and
   adhere to the private directive.

   New extension directives ought to consider defining:

   *  What it means for a directive to be specified multiple times,

   *  When the directive does not take an argument, what it means when
      an argument is present,

   *  When the directive requires an argument, what it means when it is
      missing, and

   *  Whether the directive is specific to requests, specific to
      responses, or able to be used in either.

<h4 class="h4" id="section-5.2.4">5.2.4.  Cache Directive Registry</h4>
   The "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Cache Directive Registry"
   defines the namespace for the cache directives.  It has been created
   and is now maintained at &lt;<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-cache-directives">https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-</a>
   <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-cache-directives">cache-directives</a>&gt;.

   A registration MUST include the following fields:

   *  Cache Directive Name

   *  Pointer to specification text

   Values to be added to this namespace require IETF Review (see
   <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8126#section-4.8">[RFC8126], Section 4.8</a>).

<h3 class="h3" id="section-5.3">5.3.  Expires</h3>
   The "Expires" response header field gives the date/time after which
   the response is considered stale.  See <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> for further
   discussion of the freshness model.

   The presence of an Expires header field does not imply that the
   original resource will change or cease to exist at, before, or after
   that time.

   The Expires field value is an HTTP-date timestamp, as defined in
   Section 5.6.7 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>].  See also <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> for parsing
   requirements specific to caches.

     Expires = HTTP-date

   For example

   Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT

   A cache recipient MUST interpret invalid date formats, especially the
   value "0", as representing a time in the past (i.e., "already
   expired").

   If a response includes a Cache-Control header field with the max-age
   directive (<a href="#section-5.2.2.1">Section 5.2.2.1</a>), a recipient MUST ignore the Expires
   header field.  Likewise, if a response includes the s-maxage
   directive (<a href="#section-5.2.2.10">Section 5.2.2.10</a>), a shared cache recipient MUST ignore
   the Expires header field.  In both these cases, the value in Expires
   is only intended for recipients that have not yet implemented the
   Cache-Control header field.

   An origin server without a clock (Section 5.6.7 of [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]) MUST NOT
   generate an Expires header field unless its value represents a fixed
   time in the past (always expired) or its value has been associated
   with the resource by a system with a clock.

   Historically, HTTP required the Expires field value to be no more
   than a year in the future.  While longer freshness lifetimes are no
   longer prohibited, extremely large values have been demonstrated to
   cause problems (e.g., clock overflows due to use of 32-bit integers
   for time values), and many caches will evict a response far sooner
   than that.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-5.4">5.4.  Pragma</h3>
   The "Pragma" request header field was defined for HTTP/1.0 caches, so
   that clients could specify a "no-cache" request (as Cache-Control was
   not defined until HTTP/1.1).

   However, support for Cache-Control is now widespread.  As a result,
   this specification deprecates Pragma.

      |  *Note:* Because the meaning of "Pragma: no-cache" in responses
      |  was never specified, it does not provide a reliable replacement
      |  for "Cache-Control: no-cache" in them.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-5.5">5.5.  Warning</h3>
   The "Warning" header field was used to carry additional information
   about the status or transformation of a message that might not be
   reflected in the status code.  This specification obsoletes it, as it
   is not widely generated or surfaced to users.  The information it
   carried can be gleaned from examining other header fields, such as
   Age.

<h2 class="h2" id="section-6">6.  Relationship to Applications and Other Caches</h2>
   Applications using HTTP often specify additional forms of caching.
   For example, Web browsers often have history mechanisms such as
   "Back" buttons that can be used to redisplay a representation
   retrieved earlier in a session.

   Likewise, some Web browsers implement caching of images and other
   assets within a page view; they may or may not honor HTTP caching
   semantics.

   The requirements in this specification do not necessarily apply to
   how applications use data after it is retrieved from an HTTP cache.
   For example, a history mechanism can display a previous
   representation even if it has expired, and an application can use
   cached data in other ways beyond its freshness lifetime.

   This specification does not prohibit the application from taking HTTP
   caching into account; for example, a history mechanism might tell the
   user that a view is stale, or it might honor cache directives (e.g.,
   Cache-Control: no-store).

   However, when an application caches data and does not make this
   apparent to or easily controllable by the user, it is strongly
   encouraged to define its operation with respect to HTTP cache
   directives so as not to surprise authors who expect caching semantics
   to be honored.  For example, while it might be reasonable to define
   an application cache "above" HTTP that allows a response containing
   Cache-Control: no-store to be reused for requests that are directly
   related to the request that fetched it (such as those created during
   the same page load), it would likely be surprising and confusing to
   users and authors if it were allowed to be reused for requests
   unrelated in any way to the one from which it was obtained.

<h2 class="h2" id="section-7">7.  Security Considerations</h2>
   This section is meant to inform developers, information providers,
   and users of known security concerns specific to HTTP caching.  More
   general security considerations are addressed in "HTTP/1.1"
   (<a href="#section-11">Section 11</a> of [HTTP/1.1]) and "HTTP Semantics" (Section 17 of
   [<a href="#ref-HTTP">HTTP</a>]).

   Caches expose an additional attack surface because the contents of
   the cache represent an attractive target for malicious exploitation.
   Since cache contents persist after an HTTP request is complete, an
   attack on the cache can reveal information long after a user believes
   that the information has been removed from the network.  Therefore,
   cache contents need to be protected as sensitive information.

   In particular, because private caches are restricted to a single
   user, they can be used to reconstruct a user's activity.  As a
   result, it is important for user agents to allow end users to control
   them, for example, by allowing stored responses to be removed for
   some or all origin servers.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-7.1">7.1.  Cache Poisoning</h3>
   Storing malicious content in a cache can extend the reach of an
   attacker to affect multiple users.  Such "cache poisoning" attacks
   happen when an attacker uses implementation flaws, elevated
   privileges, or other techniques to insert a response into a cache.
   This is especially effective when shared caches are used to
   distribute malicious content to many clients.

   One common attack vector for cache poisoning is to exploit
   differences in message parsing on proxies and in user agents; see
   <a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a> of [HTTP/1.1] for the relevant requirements regarding
   HTTP/1.1.

<h3 class="h3" id="section-7.2">7.2.  Timing Attacks</h3>
   Because one of the primary uses of a cache is to optimize
   performance, its use can "leak" information about which resources
   have been previously requested.

   For example, if a user visits a site and their browser caches some of
   its responses and then navigates to a second site, that site can
   attempt to load responses it knows exist on the first site.  If they
   load quickly, it can be assumed that the user has visited that site,
   or even a specific page on it.

   Such "timing attacks" can be mitigated by adding more information to
   the cache key, such as the identity of the referring site (to prevent
   the attack described above).  This is sometimes called "double
   keying".

<h3 class="h3" id="section-7.3">7.3.  Caching of Sensitive Information</h3>
   Implementation and deployment flaws (often led to by the
   misunderstanding of cache operation) might lead to the caching of
   sensitive information (e.g., authentication credentials) that is
   thought to be private, exposing it to unauthorized parties.

   Note that the Set-Cookie response header field [<a href="#ref-COOKIE">COOKIE</a>] does not
   inhibit caching; a cacheable response with a Set-Cookie header field
   can be (and often is) used to satisfy subsequent requests to caches.
   Servers that wish to control caching of these responses are
   encouraged to emit appropriate Cache-Control response header fields.

<h2 class="h2" id="appendix-B">Appendix B.  Changes from <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7234">RFC 7234</a>
</h2>
   Handling of duplicate and conflicting cache directives has been
   clarified.  (<a href="#section-4.2.1">Section 4.2.1</a>)

   Cache invalidation of the URIs in the Location and Content-Location
   header fields is no longer required but is still allowed.
   (<a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>)

   Cache invalidation of the URIs in the Location and Content-Location
   header fields is disallowed when the origin is different; previously,
   it was the host.  (<a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>)

   Handling invalid and multiple Age header field values has been
   clarified.  (<a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>)

   Some cache directives defined by this specification now have stronger
   prohibitions against generating the quoted form of their values,
   since this has been found to create interoperability problems.
   Consumers of extension cache directives are no longer required to
   accept both token and quoted-string forms, but they still need to
   parse them properly for unknown extensions.  (<a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>)

   The public and private cache directives were clarified, so that they
   do not make responses reusable under any condition.  (<a href="#section-5.2.2">Section 5.2.2</a>)

   The must-understand cache directive was introduced; caches are no
   longer required to understand the semantics of new response status
   codes unless it is present.  (<a href="#section-5.2.2.3">Section 5.2.2.3</a>)

   The Warning response header was obsoleted.  Much of the information
   supported by Warning could be gleaned by examining the response, and
   the remaining information -- although potentially useful -- was
   entirely advisory.  In practice, Warning was not added by caches or
   intermediaries.  (<a href="#section-5.5">Section 5.5</a>)
