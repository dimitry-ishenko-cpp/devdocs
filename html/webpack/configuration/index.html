<h1>Configuration</h1>
<div id="md-content">
<p>Out of the box, webpack won't require you to use a configuration file. However, it will assume the entry point of your project is <code>src/index.js</code> and will output the result in <code>dist/main.js</code> minified and optimized for production.</p> <aside class="tip"><h6 class="tip__prefix">tip</h6>
<p><a href="https://createapp.dev/webpack">createapp.dev</a> is an online tool for creating custom webpack configurations. It allows you to select various features that will be combined and added to the resulting configuration file. Also, it generates an example project based on provided webpack configuration that you can review in your browser and download.</p></aside> <p>Usually, your projects will need to extend this functionality, for this you can create a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file in the root folder and webpack will automatically use it.</p> <p>All the available configuration options are specified below.</p> <aside class="tip"><h6 class="tip__prefix">tip</h6>
