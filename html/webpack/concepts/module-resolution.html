<h1>Module Resolution</h1>
<div id="md-content">
<p>A resolver is a library which helps in locating a module by its absolute path. A module can be required as a dependency from another module as:</p>
<pre data-language="js">import foo from 'path/to/module';
// or
require('path/to/module');</pre>
<p>The dependency module can be from the application code or a third-party library. The resolver helps webpack find the module code that needs to be included in the bundle for every such <code>require</code>/<code>import</code> statement. webpack uses <a href="https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve">enhanced-resolve</a> to resolve file paths while bundling modules.</p>
<h2>
Resolving rules in webpack
</h2>
<p>Using <code>enhanced-resolve</code>, webpack can resolve three kinds of file paths:</p>
<h3>
Absolute paths
</h3>
<pre data-language="js">import '/home/me/file';

import 'C:\\Users\\me\\file';</pre>
<p>Since we already have the absolute path to the file, no further resolution is required.</p>
<h3>
Relative paths
</h3>
<pre data-language="js">import '../src/file1';
import './file2';</pre>
<p>In this case, the directory of the source file where the <code>import</code> or <code>require</code> occurs is taken to be the context directory. The relative path specified in the <code>import/require</code> is joined to this context path to produce the absolute path to the module.</p>
<h3>
Module paths
</h3>
<pre data-language="js">import 'module';
import 'module/lib/file';</pre>
<p>Modules are searched for inside all directories specified in <a href="../configuration/resolve.html#resolvemodules"><code>resolve.modules</code></a>. You can replace the original module path by an alternate path by creating an alias for it using the <a href="../configuration/resolve.html#resolvealias"><code>resolve.alias</code></a> configuration option.</p>
<ul><li>If the package contains a <code>package.json</code> file, then fields specified in <a href="../configuration/resolve.html#resolveexportsfields"><code>resolve.exportsFields</code></a> configuration options are looked up in order, and the first such field in <code>package.json</code> determines the available exports from the package according to the <a href="../guides/package-exports.html">package exports guideline</a>.</li></ul>
<p>Once the path is resolved based on the above rule, the resolver checks to see if the path points to a file or a directory. If the path points to a file:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the path has a file extension, then the file is bundled straightaway.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the file extension is resolved using the <a href="../configuration/resolve.html#resolveextensions"><code>resolve.extensions</code></a> option, which tells the resolver which extensions are acceptable for resolution e.g. <code>.js</code>, <code>.jsx</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the path points to a folder, then the following steps are taken to find the right file with the right extension:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the folder contains a <code>package.json</code> file, then fields specified in <a href="../configuration/resolve.html#resolvemainfields"><code>resolve.mainFields</code></a> configuration option are looked up in order, and the first such field in <code>package.json</code> determines the file path.</li>
<li>If there is no <code>package.json</code> or if the <a href="../configuration/resolve.html#resolvemainfields"><code>resolve.mainFields</code></a> do not return a valid path, file names specified in the <a href="../configuration/resolve.html#resolvemainfiles"><code>resolve.mainFiles</code></a> configuration option are looked for in order, to see if a matching filename exists in the imported/required directory.</li>
<li>The file extension is then resolved in a similar way using the <a href="../configuration/resolve.html#resolveextensions"><code>resolve.extensions</code></a> option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Webpack provides reasonable <a href="../configuration/resolve.html">defaults</a> for these options depending on your build target.</p>
<h2>
Resolving Loaders
</h2>
<p>This follows the same rules as those specified for file resolution. But the <a href="../configuration/resolve.html#resolveloader"><code>resolveLoader</code></a> configuration option can be used to have separate resolution rules for loaders.</p>
<h2>
Caching
</h2>
<p>Every filesystem access is cached so that multiple parallel or serial requests to the same file occur faster. In <a href="../configuration/watch.html#watch">watch mode</a>, only modified files are evicted from the cache. If watch mode is off, then the cache gets purged before every compilation.</p>
<p>See <a href="../configuration/resolve.html">Resolve API</a> to learn more about the configuration options mentioned above.</p>
