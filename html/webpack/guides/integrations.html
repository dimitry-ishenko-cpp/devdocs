<h1>Integrations</h1>
<div id="md-content">
<p>Let's start by clearing up a common misconception. Webpack is a module bundler like <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> or <a href="https://brunch.io/">Brunch</a>. It is <em>not a task runner</em> like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a>, <a href="https://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, or <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. Task runners handle automation of common development tasks such as linting, building, or testing your project. Compared to bundlers, task runners have a higher level focus. You can still benefit from their higher level tooling while leaving the problem of bundling to webpack.</p>
<p>Bundlers help you get your JavaScript and stylesheets ready for deployment, transforming them into a format that's suitable for the browser. For example, JavaScript can be <a href="../plugins/terser-webpack-plugin.html">minified</a> or <a href="code-splitting.html">split into chunks</a> and <a href="lazy-loading.html">lazy-loaded</a> to improve performance. Bundling is one of the most important challenges in web development, and solving it well can remove a lot of pain from the process.</p>
<p>The good news is that, while there is some overlap, task runners and bundlers can play well together if approached in the right way. This guide provides a high-level overview of how webpack can be integrated into some of the more popular task runners.</p>
<h2>
NPM Scripts
</h2>
<p>Often webpack users use npm <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts"><code>scripts</code></a> as their task runner. This is a good starting point. Cross-platform support can become a problem, but there are several workarounds for that. Many, if not most users, get by with npm <code>scripts</code> and various levels of webpack configuration and tooling.</p>
<p>So while webpack's core focus is bundling, there are a variety of extensions that can enable you to use it for jobs typical of a task runner. Integrating a separate tool adds complexity, so be sure to weigh the pros and cons before going forward.</p>
<h2>
Grunt
</h2>
<p>For those using Grunt, we recommend the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-webpack"><code>grunt-webpack</code></a> package. With <code>grunt-webpack</code> you can run webpack or <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server">webpack-dev-server</a> as a task, get access to stats within <a href="https://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.template">template tags</a>, split development and production configurations and more. Start by installing <code>grunt-webpack</code> as well as <code>webpack</code> itself if you haven't already:</p>
<pre data-language="bash">npm install --save-dev grunt-webpack webpack</pre>
<p>Then register a configuration and load the task:</p>
<p><strong>Gruntfile.js</strong></p>
<pre data-language="js">const webpackConfig = require('./webpack.config.js');

module.exports = function (grunt) {
  grunt.initConfig({
    webpack: {
      options: {
        stats: !process.env.NODE_ENV || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
      },
      prod: webpackConfig,
      dev: Object.assign({ watch: true }, webpackConfig),
    },
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-webpack');
};</pre>

<h2>
Gulp
</h2>
<p>Gulp is also a fairly straightforward integration with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/shama/webpack-stream"><code>webpack-stream</code></a> package (a.k.a. <code>gulp-webpack</code>). In this case, it is unnecessary to install <code>webpack</code> separately as it is a direct dependency of <code>webpack-stream</code>:</p>
<pre data-language="bash">npm install --save-dev webpack-stream</pre>
<p>You can <code>require('webpack-stream')</code> instead of <code>webpack</code> and optionally pass it an configuration:</p>
<p><strong>gulpfile.js</strong></p>
<pre data-language="js">const gulp = require('gulp');
const webpack = require('webpack-stream');
gulp.task('default', function () {
  return gulp
    .src('src/entry.js')
    .pipe(
      webpack({
        // Any configuration options...
      })
    )
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/'));
});</pre>

<h2>
Mocha
</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/zinserjan/mocha-webpack"><code>mocha-webpack</code></a> utility can be used for a clean integration with Mocha. The repository offers more details on the pros and cons but essentially <code>mocha-webpack</code> is a simple wrapper that provides almost the same CLI as Mocha itself and provides various webpack functionality like an improved watch mode and improved path resolution. Here is a small example of how you would install it and use it to run a test suite (found within <code>./test</code>):</p>
<pre data-language="bash">npm install --save-dev webpack mocha mocha-webpack
mocha-webpack 'test/**/*.js'</pre>
<p>For more information, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/zinserjan/mocha-webpack">repository</a>.</p>
<h2>
Karma
</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack"><code>karma-webpack</code></a> package allows you to use webpack to pre-process files in <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html">Karma</a>.</p>
<pre data-language="bash">npm install --save-dev webpack karma karma-webpack</pre>
<p><strong>karma.conf.js</strong></p>
<pre data-language="js">module.exports = function (config) {
  config.set({
    frameworks: ['webpack'],
    files: [
      { pattern: 'test/*_test.js', watched: false },
      { pattern: 'test/**/*_test.js', watched: false },
    ],
    preprocessors: {
      'test/*_test.js': ['webpack'],
      'test/**/*_test.js': ['webpack'],
    },
    webpack: {
      // Any custom webpack configuration...
    },
    plugins: ['karma-webpack'],
  });
};</pre>
