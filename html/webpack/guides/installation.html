<h1>Installation</h1>
<div id="md-content">
<p>This guide goes through the various methods used to install webpack.</p>
<h2>
Prerequisites
</h2>
<p>Before we begin, make sure you have a fresh version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> installed. The current Long Term Support (LTS) release is an ideal starting point. You may run into a variety of issues with the older versions as they may be missing functionality webpack and/or its related packages require.</p>
<h2>
Local Installation
</h2>
<p>The latest webpack release is:</p>
<p>To install the latest release or a specific version, run one of the following commands:</p>
<pre data-language="bash">npm install --save-dev webpack
# or specific version
npm install --save-dev webpack@&lt;version&gt;</pre>
<aside class="tip"><h6 class="tip__prefix">tip</h6>
<p>Whether to use <code>--save-dev</code> or not depends on your use cases. Say you're using webpack only for bundling, then it's suggested that you install it with <code>--save-dev</code> option since you're not going to include webpack in your production build. Otherwise you can ignore <code>--save-dev</code>.</p></aside><p>If you're using webpack v4 or later and want to call <code>webpack</code> from the command line, you'll also need to install the <a href="../api/cli.html">CLI</a>.</p>
<pre data-language="bash">npm install --save-dev webpack-cli</pre>
<p>Installing locally is what we recommend for most projects. This makes it easier to upgrade projects individually when breaking changes are introduced. Typically webpack is run via one or more <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts">npm scripts</a> which will look for a webpack installation in your local <code>node_modules</code> directory:</p>
<pre data-language="json">"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
}</pre>
<aside class="tip"><h6 class="tip__prefix">tip</h6>
<p>To run the local installation of webpack you can access its binary version as <code>node_modules/.bin/webpack</code>. Alternatively, if you are using npm v5.2.0 or greater, you can run <code>npx webpack</code> to do it.</p></aside><h2>
Global Installation
</h2>
<p>The following NPM installation will make <code>webpack</code> available globally:</p>
<pre data-language="bash">npm install --global webpack</pre>
<aside class="warning"><h6 class="warning__prefix">warning</h6>
<p>Note that this is <strong>not a recommended practice</strong>. Installing globally locks you down to a specific version of webpack and could fail in projects that use a different version.</p></aside><h2>
Bleeding Edge
</h2>
<p>If you are enthusiastic about using the latest that webpack has to offer, you can install beta versions or even directly from the webpack repository using the following commands:</p>
<pre data-language="bash">npm install --save-dev webpack@next
# or a specific tag/branch
npm install --save-dev webpack/webpack#&lt;tagname/branchname&gt;</pre>
<aside class="warning"><h6 class="warning__prefix">warning</h6>
<p>Take caution when installing these bleeding edge releases! They may still contain bugs and therefore should not be used in production.</p></aside>
