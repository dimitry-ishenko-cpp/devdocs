<header><h1>Portal Protocol</h1></header><p>The <code>portal:</code> protocol is similar to the <a href="link.html"><code>link:</code> protocol</a> (it must be a relative path to a folder which will be made available without copies), but the target is assumed to be a <a href="../advanced/lexicon.html#package">package</a> instead.</p>  <h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ATBP" id="portals-vs-links">Portals vs links<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Portals vs links" title="Direct link to Portals vs links" href="portal.html#portals-vs-links">â€‹</a>
</h2> <p>Links have to operate under the assumption that their target folder may not exist until the install is finished; this prevents them from reading the content of the folder, including any <code>package.json</code> files, and in turn preventing them from listing dependencies.</p> <p>Portals, on the other hand, must exist at resolution time or an error is thrown. This lets them read the content of the <code>package.json</code> file and be treated like any other package in the dependency tree - except that its content will be made directly available to the user, rather than copied <a href="file.html">like <code>file:</code> would do</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
