<header><h1>Link Protocol</h1></header><p>The <code>link:</code> protocol lets you connect your project to an external directory.</p>  <h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ATBP" id="links-vs-portals">Links vs portals<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Links vs portals" title="Direct link to Links vs portals" href="link.html#links-vs-portals">â€‹</a>
</h2> <p>Since the target referenced by <code>link:</code> may not exist until postinstall scripts have run, and since Yarn guarantees a predictable behavior regardless of the execution order, we need to disambiguate <em>packages</em> (which contain <code>package.json</code> files, and may list dependencies of their own) from <em>arbitrary folders</em> (which may not).</p> <p>In practice, this means that <code>link:</code> dependencies can only point to arbitrary folders - in other words, whatever it references cannot have a <code>package.json</code> file, and thus can't have dependencies. If you need to symlink to a <em>package</em>, use <a href="portal.html">portals</a> instead.</p><div class="_attribution">
