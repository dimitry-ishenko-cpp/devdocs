<h1>Demo site</h1> <p>To create a new site on Wagtail, we recommend the <code>wagtail start</code> command in <a class="reference internal" href="index.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">Getting started</span></a>. We also have a demo site, The Wagtail Bakery, which contains example page types and models. We recommend you use the demo site for testing during development of Wagtail itself.</p> <p>The source code and installation instructions can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo">https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo</a></p><div class="_attribution">
