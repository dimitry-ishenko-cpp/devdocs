<h1>ModelAdmin</h1> <p>The <code>modeladmin</code> module allows you to add any model in your project to the Wagtail admin. You can create customisable listing pages for a model, including plain Django models, and add navigation elements so that a model can be accessed directly from the Wagtail admin. Simply extend the <code>ModelAdmin</code> class, override a few attributes to suit your needs, register it with Wagtail using an easy one-line <code>modeladmin_register</code> method (you can copy and paste from the examples below), and you’re good to go. Your model doesn’t need to extend <code>Page</code> or be registered as a <code>Snippet</code>, and it won’t interfere with any of the existing admin functionality that Wagtail provides.</p> <section id="summary-of-features"> <h2 id="modeladmin-feature-summary">Summary of features</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>A customisable list view, allowing you to control what values are displayed for each row, available options for result filtering, default ordering, spreadsheet downloads and more.</li> <li>Access your list views from the Wagtail admin menu easily with automatically generated menu items, with automatic ‘active item’ highlighting. Control the label text and icons used with easy-to-change attributes on your class.</li> <li>An additional <code>ModelAdminGroup</code> class, that allows you to group your related models, and list them together in their own submenu, for a more logical user experience.</li> <li>Simple, robust <strong>add</strong> and <strong>edit</strong> views for your non-Page models that use the panel configurations defined on your model using Wagtail’s edit panels.</li> <li>For Page models, the system directs to Wagtail’s existing add and edit views, and returns you back to the correct list page, for a seamless experience.</li> <li>Full respect for permissions assigned to your Wagtail users and groups. Users will only be able to do what you want them to!</li> <li>All you need to easily hook your <code>ModelAdmin</code> classes into Wagtail, taking care of URL registration, menu changes, and registering any missing model permissions, so that you can assign them to Groups.</li> <li>
<strong>Built to be customisable</strong> - While <code>modeladmin</code> provides a solid experience out of the box, you can easily use your own templates, and the <code>ModelAdmin</code> class has a large number of methods that you can override or extend, allowing you to customise the behaviour to a greater degree.</li> </ul> </section> <section id="want-to-know-more-about-customising-modeladmin"> <h2>Want to know more about customising <code>ModelAdmin</code>?</h2>  <ul> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="primer.html"><code>modeladmin</code> customisation primer</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="base_url.html">Customising the base URL path</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="menu_item.html">Customising the menu item</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="indexview.html">Customising <code>IndexView</code> - the listing view</a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="create_edit_delete_views.html">Customising <code>CreateView</code>, <code>EditView</code> and <code>DeleteView</code></a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="create_edit_delete_views.html#changing-which-fields-appear-in-createview-editview">Changing which fields appear in <code>CreateView</code> &amp; <code>EditView</code></a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="inspectview.html">Enabling &amp; customising <code>InspectView</code></a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="chooseparentview.html">Customising <code>ChooseParentView</code></a></li> <li class="toctree-l1"><a class="reference internal" href="tips_and_tricks/index.html">Additional tips and tricks</a></li> </ul>  <section id="installation"> <h3 id="modeladmin-usage">Installation</h3> <p>Add <code>wagtail.contrib.modeladmin</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">    INSTALLED_APPS = [
