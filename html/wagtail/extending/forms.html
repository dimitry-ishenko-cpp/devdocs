<h1>Using forms in admin views</h1> <p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/forms/">Django’s forms framework</a> can be used within Wagtail admin views just like in any other Django app. However, Wagtail also provides various admin-specific form widgets, such as date/time pickers and choosers for pages, documents, images and snippets. By constructing forms using <code>wagtail.admin.forms.models.WagtailAdminModelForm</code> as the base class instead of <code>django.forms.models.ModelForm</code>, the most appropriate widget will be selected for each model field. For example, given the model and form definition:</p> <pre data-language="python">from django.db import models

from wagtail.admin.forms.models import WagtailAdminModelForm
from wagtail.images.models import Image


class FeaturedImage(models.Model):
    date = models.DateField()
    image = models.ForeignKey(Image, on_delete=models.CASCADE)


class FeaturedImageForm(WagtailAdminModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = FeaturedImage
</pre> <p>the <code>date</code> and <code>image</code> fields on the form will use a date picker and image chooser widget respectively.</p> <section id="defining-admin-form-widgets"> <h2>Defining admin form widgets</h2> <p>If you have implemented a form widget of your own, you can configure <code>WagtailAdminModelForm</code> to select it for a given model field type. This is done by calling the <code>wagtail.admin.forms.models.register_form_field_override</code> function, typically in an <code>AppConfig.ready</code> method.</p>  <p>For example, if the app <code>wagtail.videos</code> implements a <code>Video</code> model and a <code>VideoChooser</code> form widget, the following AppConfig definition will ensure that <code>WagtailAdminModelForm</code> selects <code>VideoChooser</code> as the form widget for any foreign keys pointing to <code>Video</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">from django.apps import AppConfig
from django.db.models import ForeignKey


class WagtailVideosAppConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'wagtail.videos'
    label = 'wagtailvideos'

    def ready(self):
        from wagtail.admin.forms.models import register_form_field_override
        from .models import Video
        from .widgets import VideoChooser
        register_form_field_override(ForeignKey, to=Video, override={'widget': VideoChooser})
</pre> <p>Wagtail’s edit views for pages, snippets and ModelAdmin use <code>WagtailAdminModelForm</code> as standard, so this change will take effect across the Wagtail admin; a foreign key to <code>Video</code> on a page model will automatically use the <code>VideoChooser</code> widget, with no need to specify this explicitly.</p> </section> <section id="panels"> <h2>Panels</h2> <p>Panels (also known as edit handlers until Wagtail 3.0) are Wagtail’s mechanism for specifying the content and layout of a model form without having to write a template. They are used for the editing interface for pages and snippets, as well as the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/contrib/modeladmin/index.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">ModelAdmin</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/contrib/settings.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">site settings</span></a> contrib modules.</p> <p>See <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/pages/panels.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">Panel types</span></a> for the set of panel types provided by Wagtail. All panels inherit from the base class <code>wagtail.admin.panels.Panel</code>. A single panel object (usually <code>ObjectList</code> or <code>TabbedInterface</code>) exists at the top level and is the only one directly accessed by the view code; panels containing child panels inherit from the base class <code>wagtail.admin.panels.PanelGroup</code> and take care of recursively calling methods on their child panels where appropriate.</p> <p>A view performs the following steps to render a model form through the panels mechanism:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The top-level panel object for the model is retrieved. Usually this is done by looking up the model’s <code>edit_handler</code> property and falling back on an <code>ObjectList</code> consisting of children given by the model’s <code>panels</code> property. However, it may come from elsewhere - for example, the ModelAdmin module allows defining it on the ModelAdmin configuration object.</li> <li>If the <code>PanelsGroup</code>s permissions do not allow a user to see this panel, then nothing more will be done.</li> <li>The view calls <code>bind_to_model</code> on the top-level panel, passing the model class, and this returns a clone of the panel with a <code>model</code> property. As part of this process the <code>on_model_bound</code> method is invoked on each child panel, to allow it to perform additional initialisation that requires access to the model (for example, this is where <code>FieldPanel</code> retrieves the model field definition).</li> <li>
<p>The view then calls <code>get_form_class</code> on the top-level panel to retrieve a ModelForm subclass that can be used to edit the model. This proceeds as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Retrieve a base form class from the model’s <code>base_form_class</code> property, falling back on <code>wagtail.admin.forms.WagtailAdminModelForm</code>
</li> <li>Call <code>get_form_options</code> on each child panel - which returns a dictionary of properties including <code>fields</code> and <code>widgets</code> - and merge the results into a single dictionary</li> <li>Construct a subclass of the base form class, with the options dict forming the attributes of the inner <code>Meta</code> class.</li> </ul> </li> <li>An instance of the form class is created as per a normal Django form view.</li> <li>The view then calls <code>get_bound_panel</code> on the top-level panel, passing <code>instance</code>, <code>form</code> and <code>request</code> as keyword arguments. This returns a <code>BoundPanel</code> object, which follows <a class="reference internal" href="template_components.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">the template component API</span></a>. Finally, the <code>BoundPanel</code> object (and its media definition) is rendered onto the template.</li> </ul> <p>New panel types can be defined by subclassing <code>wagtail.admin.panels.Panel</code> - see <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/panel_api.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">Panel API</span></a>.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
