<h1 id="id1">Audit log</h1> <p>Wagtail provides a mechanism to log actions performed on its objects. Common activities such as page creation, update, deletion, locking and unlocking, revision scheduling and privacy changes are automatically logged at the model level.</p> <p>The Wagtail admin uses the action log entries to provide a site-wide and page specific history of changes. It uses a registry of ‘actions’ that provide additional context for the logged action.</p> <p>The audit log-driven Page history replaces the revisions list page, but provide a filter for revision-specific entries.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The audit log does not replace revisions.</p> </div> <p>The <code>wagtail.log_actions.log</code> function can be used to add logging to your own code.</p>  <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>When adding logging, you need to log the action or actions that happen to the object. For example, if the user creates and publishes a page, there should be a “create” entry and a “publish” entry. Or, if the user copies a published page and chooses to keep it published, there should be a “copy” and a “publish” entry for new page.</p> </div> <pre data-language="python">

with LogContext(user=User.objects.get(username='admin')):
    # ...
    log(page, 'wagtail.edit')
    # ...
    log(page, 'wagtail.publish')
</pre> <p>All <code>log</code> calls within the block will then be attributed to the specified user, and assigned a common UUID. A log context is created automatically for views within the Wagtail admin.</p> </section> <section id="log-models"> <h2>Log models</h2> <p>Logs are stored in the database via the models <code>wagtail.models.PageLogEntry</code> (for actions on Page instances) and <code>wagtail.models.ModelLogEntry</code> (for actions on all other models). Page logs are stored in their own model to ensure that reports can be filtered according to the current user’s permissions, which could not be done efficiently with a generic foreign key.</p> <p>If your own models have complex reporting requirements that would make <code>ModelLogEntry</code> unsuitable, you can configure them to be logged to their own log model; this is done by subclassing the abstract <code>wagtail.models.BaseLogEntry</code> model, and registering that model with the log registry’s <code>register_model</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="python">from myapp.models import Sprocket, SprocketLogEntry
# here SprocketLogEntry is a subclass of BaseLogEntry

@hooks.register('register_log_actions')
def sprocket_log_model(actions):
    actions.register_model(Sprocket, SprocketLogEntry)
