<h1 id="styleguide">UI Styleguide</h1> <p>Developers working on the Wagtail UI or creating new UI components may wish to test their work against our Styleguide, which is provided as the contrib module “wagtailstyleguide”.</p> <p>To install the styleguide module on your site, add it to the list of <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> in your settings:</p> <pre data-language="python">INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    'wagtail.contrib.styleguide',
    # ...
)
</pre> <p>This will add a ‘Styleguide’ item to the Settings menu in the admin.</p> <p>At present the styleguide is static: new UI components must be added to it manually, and there are no hooks into it for other modules to use. We hope to support hooks in the future.</p> <p>The styleguide doesn’t currently provide examples of all the core interface components; notably the Page, Document, Image and Snippet chooser interfaces are not currently represented.</p><div class="_attribution">
