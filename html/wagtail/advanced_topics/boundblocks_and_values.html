<h1 id="boundblocks-and-values">About StreamField BoundBlocks and values</h1> <p>All StreamField block types accept a <code>template</code> parameter to determine how they will be rendered on a page. However, for blocks that handle basic Python data types, such as <code>CharBlock</code> and <code>IntegerBlock</code>, there are some limitations on where the template will take effect, since those built-in types (<code>str</code>, <code>int</code> and so on) cannot be ‘taught’ about their template rendering. As an example of this, consider the following block definition:</p> <pre data-language="python">class HeadingBlock(blocks.CharBlock):
    class Meta:
        template = 'blocks/heading.html'
</pre> <p>where <code>blocks/heading.html</code> consists of:</p> <pre data-language="markup">&lt;h1&gt;{{ value }}&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre> <p>This gives us a block that behaves as an ordinary text field, but wraps its output in <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags whenever it is rendered:</p> <pre data-language="python">class BlogPage(Page):
    body = StreamField([
        # ...
        ('heading', HeadingBlock()),
        # ...
    ], use_json_field=True)
</pre> <pre data-language="markup">{% load wagtailcore_tags %}

{% for block in page.body %}
    {% if block.block_type == 'heading' %}
        {% include_block block %}  {# This block will output its own &lt;h1&gt;...&lt;/h1&gt; tags. #}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</pre> <p>This kind of arrangement - a value that supposedly represents a plain text string, but has its own custom HTML representation when output on a template - would normally be a very messy thing to achieve in Python, but it works here because the items you get when iterating over a StreamField are not actually the ‘native’ values of the blocks. Instead, each item is returned as an instance of <code>BoundBlock</code> - an object that represents the pairing of a value and its block definition. By keeping track of the block definition, a <code>BoundBlock</code> always knows which template to render. To get to the underlying value - in this case, the text content of the heading - you would need to access <code>block.value</code>. Indeed, if you were to output <code>{% include_block block.value %}</code> on the page, you would find that it renders as plain text, without the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags.</p> <p>(More precisely, the items returned when iterating over a StreamField are instances of a class <code>StreamChild</code>, which provides the <code>block_type</code> property as well as <code>value</code>.)</p> <p>Experienced Django developers may find it helpful to compare this to the <code>BoundField</code> class in Django’s forms framework, which represents the pairing of a form field value with its corresponding form field definition, and therefore knows how to render the value as an HTML form field.</p> <p>Most of the time, you won’t need to worry about these internal details; Wagtail will use the template rendering wherever you would expect it to. However, there are certain cases where the illusion isn’t quite complete - namely, when accessing children of a <code>ListBlock</code> or <code>StructBlock</code>. In these cases, there is no <code>BoundBlock</code> wrapper, and so the item cannot be relied upon to know its own template rendering. For example, consider the following setup, where our <code>HeadingBlock</code> is a child of a StructBlock:</p> <pre data-language="python">class EventBlock(blocks.StructBlock):
    heading = HeadingBlock()
    description = blocks.TextBlock()
    # ...

    class Meta:
        template = 'blocks/event.html'
</pre> <p>In <code>blocks/event.html</code>:</p> <pre data-language="markup">{% load wagtailcore_tags %}

&lt;div class="event {% if value.heading == 'Party!' %}lots-of-balloons{% endif %}"&gt;
    {% include_block value.heading %}
    - {% include_block value.description %}
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre> <p>In this case, <code>value.heading</code> returns the plain string value rather than a <code>BoundBlock</code>; this is necessary because otherwise the comparison in <code>{% if value.heading == 'Party!' %}</code> would never succeed. This in turn means that <code>{% include_block value.heading %}</code> renders as the plain string, without the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags. To get the HTML rendering, you need to explicitly access the <code>BoundBlock</code> instance through <code>value.bound_blocks.heading</code>:</p> <pre data-language="markup">{% load wagtailcore_tags %}

&lt;div class="event {% if value.heading == 'Party!' %}lots-of-balloons{% endif %}"&gt;
    {% include_block value.bound_blocks.heading %}
    - {% include_block value.description %}
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre> <p>In practice, it would probably be more natural and readable to make the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag explicit in the EventBlock’s template:</p> <pre data-language="markup">{% load wagtailcore_tags %}

&lt;div class="event {% if value.heading == 'Party!' %}lots-of-balloons{% endif %}"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{ value.heading }}&lt;/h1&gt;
    - {% include_block value.description %}
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre> <p>This limitation does not apply to StructBlock and StreamBlock values as children of a StructBlock, because Wagtail implements these as complex objects that know their own template rendering, even when not wrapped in a <code>BoundBlock</code>. For example, if a StructBlock is nested in another StructBlock, as in:</p> <pre data-language="python">class EventBlock(blocks.StructBlock):
    heading = HeadingBlock()
    description = blocks.TextBlock()
    guest_speaker = blocks.StructBlock([
        ('first_name', blocks.CharBlock()),
        ('surname', blocks.CharBlock()),
        ('photo', ImageChooserBlock()),
    ], template='blocks/speaker.html')
</pre> <p>then <code>{% include_block value.guest_speaker %}</code> within the EventBlock’s template will pick up the template rendering from <code>blocks/speaker.html</code> as intended.</p> <p>In summary, interactions between BoundBlocks and plain values work according to the following rules:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>When iterating over the value of a StreamField or StreamBlock (as in <code>{% for block in page.body %}</code>), you will get back a sequence of BoundBlocks.</li> <li>If you have a BoundBlock instance, you can access the plain value as <code>block.value</code>.</li> <li>Accessing a child of a StructBlock (as in <code>value.heading</code>) will return a plain value; to retrieve the BoundBlock instead, use <code>value.bound_blocks.heading</code>.</li> <li>Likewise, accessing children of a ListBlock (for example <code>for item in value</code>) will return plain values; to retrieve BoundBlocks instead, use <code>value.bound_blocks</code>.</li> <li>StructBlock and StreamBlock values always know how to render their own templates, even if you only have the plain value rather than the BoundBlock.</li> </ol> <div class="versionchanged"> <p><span class="versionmodified changed">Changed in version 2.16: </span>The value of a ListBlock now provides a <code>bound_blocks</code> property; previously it was a plain Python list of child values.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
