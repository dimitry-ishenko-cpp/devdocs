<h1 id="custom-image-model">Custom image models</h1> <p>The <code>Image</code> model can be customised, allowing additional fields to be added to images.</p> <p>To do this, you need to add two models to your project:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The image model itself that inherits from <code>wagtail.images.models.AbstractImage</code>. This is where you would add your additional fields</li> <li>The renditions model that inherits from <code>wagtail.images.models.AbstractRendition</code>. This is used to store renditions for the new model.</li> </ul> <p>Hereâ€™s an example:</p> <pre data-language="python"># models.py
from django.db import models

from wagtail.images.models import Image, AbstractImage, AbstractRendition


class CustomImage(AbstractImage):
    # Add any extra fields to image here

    # To add a caption field:
    # caption = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)

    admin_form_fields = Image.admin_form_fields + (
        # Then add the field names here to make them appear in the form:
        # 'caption',
    )


class CustomRendition(AbstractRendition):
    image = models.ForeignKey(CustomImage, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='renditions')

    class Meta:
        unique_together = (
            ('image', 'filter_spec', 'focal_point_key'),
        )
</pre> <p>Then set the <code>WAGTAILIMAGES_IMAGE_MODEL</code> setting to point to it:</p> <pre data-language="python">WAGTAILIMAGES_IMAGE_MODEL = 'images.CustomImage'
