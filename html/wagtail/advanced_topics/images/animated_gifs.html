<h1>Animated GIF support</h1> <p>Pillow, Wagtail’s default image library, doesn’t support animated GIFs.</p> <p>To get animated GIF support, you will have to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.6.7/guide/install.html">install Wand</a>. Wand is a binding to ImageMagick so make sure that has been installed as well.</p> <p>When installed, Wagtail will automatically use Wand for resizing GIF files but continue to resize other images with Pillow.</p><div class="_attribution">
