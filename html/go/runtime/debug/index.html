(Even if this is not called, the runtime gradually returns memory to the operating system in a background task.) </p>
<h2 id="PrintStack">func <span>PrintStack</span>  </h2> <pre data-language="go">func PrintStack()</pre> <p>PrintStack prints to standard error the stack trace returned by runtime.Stack. </p>
<h2 id="ReadGCStats">func <span>ReadGCStats</span>  <span title="Added in Go 1.1">1.1</span> </h2> <pre data-language="go">func ReadGCStats(stats *GCStats)</pre> <p>ReadGCStats reads statistics about garbage collection into stats. The number of entries in the pause history is system-dependent; stats.Pause slice will be reused if large enough, reallocated otherwise. ReadGCStats may use the full capacity of the stats.Pause slice. If stats.PauseQuantiles is non-empty, ReadGCStats fills it with quantiles summarizing the distribution of pause time. For example, if len(stats.PauseQuantiles) is 5, it will be filled with the minimum, 25%, 50%, 75%, and maximum pause times. </p>
<h2 id="SetGCPercent">func <span>SetGCPercent</span>  <span title="Added in Go 1.1">1.1</span> </h2> <pre data-language="go">func SetGCPercent(percent int) int</pre> <p>SetGCPercent sets the garbage collection target percentage: a collection is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage. SetGCPercent returns the previous setting. The initial setting is the value of the GOGC environment variable at startup, or 100 if the variable is not set. This setting may be effectively reduced in order to maintain a memory limit. A negative percentage effectively disables garbage collection, unless the memory limit is reached. See SetMemoryLimit for more details. </p>
<h2 id="SetMaxStack">func <span>SetMaxStack</span>  <span title="Added in Go 1.2">1.2</span> </h2> <pre data-language="go">func SetMaxStack(bytes int) int</pre> <p>SetMaxStack sets the maximum amount of memory that can be used by a single goroutine stack. If any goroutine exceeds this limit while growing its stack, the program crashes. SetMaxStack returns the previous setting. The initial setting is 1 GB on 64-bit systems, 250 MB on 32-bit systems. There may be a system-imposed maximum stack limit regardless of the value provided to SetMaxStack. </p>
<p>SetMaxStack is useful mainly for limiting the damage done by goroutines that enter an infinite recursion. It only limits future stack growth. </p>
<h2 id="SetMaxThreads">func <span>SetMaxThreads</span>  <span title="Added in Go 1.2">1.2</span> </h2> <pre data-language="go">func SetMaxThreads(threads int) int</pre> <p>SetMaxThreads sets the maximum number of operating system threads that the Go program can use. If it attempts to use more than this many, the program crashes. SetMaxThreads returns the previous setting. The initial setting is 10,000 threads. </p>
<p>The limit controls the number of operating system threads, not the number of goroutines. A Go program creates a new thread only when a goroutine is ready to run but all the existing threads are blocked in system calls, cgo calls, or are locked to other goroutines due to use of runtime.LockOSThread. </p>
<p>SetMaxThreads is useful mainly for limiting the damage done by programs that create an unbounded number of threads. The idea is to take down the program before it takes down the operating system. </p>
<h2 id="SetMemoryLimit">func <span>SetMemoryLimit</span>  <span title="Added in Go 1.19">1.19</span> </h2> <pre data-language="go">func SetMemoryLimit(limit int64) int64</pre> <p>SetMemoryLimit provides the runtime with a soft memory limit. </p>
<p>The runtime undertakes several processes to try to respect this memory limit, including adjustments to the frequency of garbage collections and returning memory to the underlying system more aggressively. This limit will be respected even if GOGC=off (or, if SetGCPercent(-1) is executed). </p>
<p>The input limit is provided as bytes, and includes all memory mapped, managed, and not released by the Go runtime. Notably, it does not account for space used by the Go binary and memory external to Go, such as memory managed by the underlying system on behalf of the process, or memory managed by non-Go code inside the same process. Examples of excluded memory sources include: OS kernel memory held on behalf of the process, memory allocated by C code, and memory mapped by syscall.Mmap (because it is not managed by the Go runtime). </p>
<p>More specifically, the following expression accurately reflects the value the runtime attempts to maintain as the limit: </p>
<pre data-language="go">runtime.MemStats.Sys - runtime.MemStats.HeapReleased
</pre> <p>or in terms of the runtime/metrics package: </p>
<pre data-language="go">/memory/classes/total:bytes - /memory/classes/heap/released:bytes
</pre> <p>A zero limit or a limit that's lower than the amount of memory used by the Go runtime may cause the garbage collector to run nearly continuously. However, the application may still make progress. </p>
<p>The memory limit is always respected by the Go runtime, so to effectively disable this behavior, set the limit very high. math.MaxInt64 is the canonical value for disabling the limit, but values much greater than the available memory on the underlying system work just as well. </p>
<p>See <a href="https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide">https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide</a> for a detailed guide explaining the soft memory limit in more detail, as well as a variety of common use-cases and scenarios. </p>
<p>The initial setting is math.MaxInt64 unless the GOMEMLIMIT environment variable is set, in which case it provides the initial setting. GOMEMLIMIT is a numeric value in bytes with an optional unit suffix. The supported suffixes include B, KiB, MiB, GiB, and TiB. These suffixes represent quantities of bytes as defined by the IEC 80000-13 standard. That is, they are based on powers of two: KiB means 2^10 bytes, MiB means 2^20 bytes, and so on. </p>
<p>SetMemoryLimit returns the previously set memory limit. A negative input does not adjust the limit, and allows for retrieval of the currently set memory limit. </p>
<h2 id="SetPanicOnFault">func <span>SetPanicOnFault</span>  <span title="Added in Go 1.3">1.3</span> </h2> <pre data-language="go">func SetPanicOnFault(enabled bool) bool</pre> <p>SetPanicOnFault controls the runtime's behavior when a program faults at an unexpected (non-nil) address. Such faults are typically caused by bugs such as runtime memory corruption, so the default response is to crash the program. Programs working with memory-mapped files or unsafe manipulation of memory may cause faults at non-nil addresses in less dramatic situations; SetPanicOnFault allows such programs to request that the runtime trigger only a panic, not a crash. The runtime.Error that the runtime panics with may have an additional method: </p>
<pre data-language="go">Addr() uintptr
</pre> <p>If that method exists, it returns the memory address which triggered the fault. The results of Addr are best-effort and the veracity of the result may depend on the platform. SetPanicOnFault applies only to the current goroutine. It returns the previous setting. </p>
<h2 id="SetTraceback">func <span>SetTraceback</span>  <span title="Added in Go 1.6">1.6</span> </h2> <pre data-language="go">func SetTraceback(level string)</pre> <p>SetTraceback sets the amount of detail printed by the runtime in the traceback it prints before exiting due to an unrecovered panic or an internal runtime error. The level argument takes the same values as the GOTRACEBACK environment variable. For example, SetTraceback("all") ensure that the program prints all goroutines when it crashes. See the package runtime documentation for details. If SetTraceback is called with a level lower than that of the environment variable, the call is ignored. </p>
<h2 id="Stack">func <span>Stack</span>  </h2> <pre data-language="go">func Stack() []byte</pre> <p>Stack returns a formatted stack trace of the goroutine that calls it. It calls runtime.Stack with a large enough buffer to capture the entire trace. </p>
<h2 id="WriteHeapDump">func <span>WriteHeapDump</span>  <span title="Added in Go 1.3">1.3</span> </h2> <pre data-language="go">func WriteHeapDump(fd uintptr)</pre> <p>WriteHeapDump writes a description of the heap and the objects in it to the given file descriptor. </p>
<p>WriteHeapDump suspends the execution of all goroutines until the heap dump is completely written. Thus, the file descriptor must not be connected to a pipe or socket whose other end is in the same Go process; instead, use a temporary file or network socket. </p>
<p>The heap dump format is defined at <a href="https://golang.org/s/go15heapdump">https://golang.org/s/go15heapdump</a>. </p>
