</ul>     <h2 id="pkg-overview">Overview </h2> <p>Package runtime contains operations that interact with Go's runtime system, such as functions to control goroutines. It also includes the low-level type information used by the reflect package; see <span>reflect</span>'s documentation for the programmable interface to the run-time type system. </p>
<h3 id="hdr-Environment_Variables">Environment Variables</h3> <p>The following environment variables ($name or %name%, depending on the host operating system) control the run-time behavior of Go programs. The meanings and use may change from release to release. </p>
<p>The GOGC variable sets the initial garbage collection target percentage. A collection is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage. The default is GOGC=100. Setting GOGC=off disables the garbage collector entirely. <span>runtime/debug.SetGCPercent</span> allows changing this percentage at run time. </p>
<p>The GOMEMLIMIT variable sets a soft memory limit for the runtime. This memory limit includes the Go heap and all other memory managed by the runtime, and excludes external memory sources such as mappings of the binary itself, memory managed in other languages, and memory held by the operating system on behalf of the Go program. GOMEMLIMIT is a numeric value in bytes with an optional unit suffix. The supported suffixes include B, KiB, MiB, GiB, and TiB. These suffixes represent quantities of bytes as defined by the IEC 80000-13 standard. That is, they are based on powers of two: KiB means 2^10 bytes, MiB means 2^20 bytes, and so on. The default setting is <span>math.MaxInt64</span>, which effectively disables the memory limit. <span>runtime/debug.SetMemoryLimit</span> allows changing this limit at run time. </p>
<p>The GODEBUG variable controls debugging variables within the runtime. It is a comma-separated list of name=val pairs setting these named variables: </p>
<pre data-language="go">clobberfree: setting clobberfree=1 causes the garbage collector to
clobber the memory content of an object with bad content when it frees
the object.

cpu.*: cpu.all=off disables the use of all optional instruction set extensions.
cpu.extension=off disables use of instructions from the specified instruction set extension.
extension is the lower case name for the instruction set extension such as sse41 or avx
as listed in internal/cpu package. As an example cpu.avx=off disables runtime detection
and thereby use of AVX instructions.

cgocheck: setting cgocheck=0 disables all checks for packages
using cgo to incorrectly pass Go pointers to non-Go code.
Setting cgocheck=1 (the default) enables relatively cheap
checks that may miss some errors. A more complete, but slow,
cgocheck mode can be enabled using GOEXPERIMENT (which
requires a rebuild), see https://pkg.go.dev/internal/goexperiment for details.

disablethp: setting disablethp=1 on Linux disables transparent huge pages for the heap.
It has no effect on other platforms. disablethp is meant for compatibility with versions
of Go before 1.21, which stopped working around a Linux kernel default that can result
in significant memory overuse. See https://go.dev/issue/64332. This setting will be
removed in a future release, so operators should tweak their Linux configuration to suit
their needs before then. See https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide#Linux_transparent_huge_pages.

dontfreezetheworld: by default, the start of a fatal panic or throw
"freezes the world", preempting all threads to stop all running
goroutines, which makes it possible to traceback all goroutines, and
keeps their state close to the point of panic. Setting
dontfreezetheworld=1 disables this preemption, allowing goroutines to
continue executing during panic processing. Note that goroutines that
naturally enter the scheduler will still stop. This can be useful when
debugging the runtime scheduler, as freezetheworld perturbs scheduler
state and thus may hide problems.

efence: setting efence=1 causes the allocator to run in a mode
where each object is allocated on a unique page and addresses are
never recycled.

gccheckmark: setting gccheckmark=1 enables verification of the
garbage collector's concurrent mark phase by performing a
second mark pass while the world is stopped.  If the second
pass finds a reachable object that was not found by concurrent
mark, the garbage collector will panic.

gcpacertrace: setting gcpacertrace=1 causes the garbage collector to
print information about the internal state of the concurrent pacer.

gcshrinkstackoff: setting gcshrinkstackoff=1 disables moving goroutines
onto smaller stacks. In this mode, a goroutine's stack can only grow.

gcstoptheworld: setting gcstoptheworld=1 disables concurrent garbage collection,
making every garbage collection a stop-the-world event. Setting gcstoptheworld=2
also disables concurrent sweeping after the garbage collection finishes.

gctrace: setting gctrace=1 causes the garbage collector to emit a single line to standard
error at each collection, summarizing the amount of memory collected and the
length of the pause. The format of this line is subject to change. Included in
the explanation below is also the relevant runtime/metrics metric for each field.
Currently, it is:
	gc # @#s #%: #+#+# ms clock, #+#/#/#+# ms cpu, #-&gt;#-&gt;# MB, # MB goal, # MB stacks, #MB globals, # P
where the fields are as follows:
	gc #         the GC number, incremented at each GC
	@#s          time in seconds since program start
	#%           percentage of time spent in GC since program start
	#+...+#      wall-clock/CPU times for the phases of the GC
	#-&gt;#-&gt;# MB   heap size at GC start, at GC end, and live heap, or /gc/scan/heap:bytes
	# MB goal    goal heap size, or /gc/heap/goal:bytes
	# MB stacks  estimated scannable stack size, or /gc/scan/stack:bytes
	# MB globals scannable global size, or /gc/scan/globals:bytes
	# P          number of processors used, or /sched/gomaxprocs:threads
The phases are stop-the-world (STW) sweep termination, concurrent
mark and scan, and STW mark termination. The CPU times
for mark/scan are broken down in to assist time (GC performed in
line with allocation), background GC time, and idle GC time.
If the line ends with "(forced)", this GC was forced by a
runtime.GC() call.

harddecommit: setting harddecommit=1 causes memory that is returned to the OS to
also have protections removed on it. This is the only mode of operation on Windows,
but is helpful in debugging scavenger-related issues on other platforms. Currently,
only supported on Linux.

inittrace: setting inittrace=1 causes the runtime to emit a single line to standard
error for each package with init work, summarizing the execution time and memory
allocation. No information is printed for inits executed as part of plugin loading
and for packages without both user defined and compiler generated init work.
The format of this line is subject to change. Currently, it is:
	init # @#ms, # ms clock, # bytes, # allocs
where the fields are as follows:
	init #      the package name
	@# ms       time in milliseconds when the init started since program start
	# clock     wall-clock time for package initialization work
	# bytes     memory allocated on the heap
	# allocs    number of heap allocations

madvdontneed: setting madvdontneed=0 will use MADV_FREE
instead of MADV_DONTNEED on Linux when returning memory to the
kernel. This is more efficient, but means RSS numbers will
drop only when the OS is under memory pressure. On the BSDs and
Illumos/Solaris, setting madvdontneed=1 will use MADV_DONTNEED instead
of MADV_FREE. This is less efficient, but causes RSS numbers to drop
more quickly.

memprofilerate: setting memprofilerate=X will update the value of runtime.MemProfileRate.
When set to 0 memory profiling is disabled.  Refer to the description of
MemProfileRate for the default value.

profstackdepth: profstackdepth=128 (the default) will set the maximum stack
depth used by all pprof profilers except for the CPU profiler to 128 frames.
Stack traces that exceed this limit will be truncated to the limit starting
from the leaf frame. Setting profstackdepth to any value above 1024 will
silently default to 1024. Future versions of Go may remove this limitation
and extend profstackdepth to apply to the CPU profiler and execution tracer.

pagetrace: setting pagetrace=/path/to/file will write out a trace of page events
that can be viewed, analyzed, and visualized using the x/debug/cmd/pagetrace tool.
Build your program with GOEXPERIMENT=pagetrace to enable this functionality. Do not
enable this functionality if your program is a setuid binary as it introduces a security
risk in that scenario. Currently not supported on Windows, plan9 or js/wasm. Setting this
option for some applications can produce large traces, so use with care.

panicnil: setting panicnil=1 disables the runtime error when calling panic with nil
interface value or an untyped nil.

runtimecontentionstacks: setting runtimecontentionstacks=1 enables inclusion of call stacks
related to contention on runtime-internal locks in the "mutex" profile, subject to the
MutexProfileFraction setting. When runtimecontentionstacks=0, contention on
runtime-internal locks will report as "runtime._LostContendedRuntimeLock". When
runtimecontentionstacks=1, the call stacks will correspond to the unlock call that released
the lock. But instead of the value corresponding to the amount of contention that call
stack caused, it corresponds to the amount of time the caller of unlock had to wait in its
original call to lock. A future release is expected to align those and remove this setting.

invalidptr: invalidptr=1 (the default) causes the garbage collector and stack
copier to crash the program if an invalid pointer value (for example, 1)
is found in a pointer-typed location. Setting invalidptr=0 disables this check.
This should only be used as a temporary workaround to diagnose buggy code.
The real fix is to not store integers in pointer-typed locations.

sbrk: setting sbrk=1 replaces the memory allocator and garbage collector
with a trivial allocator that obtains memory from the operating system and
never reclaims any memory.

scavtrace: setting scavtrace=1 causes the runtime to emit a single line to standard
error, roughly once per GC cycle, summarizing the amount of work done by the
scavenger as well as the total amount of memory returned to the operating system
and an estimate of physical memory utilization. The format of this line is subject
to change, but currently it is:
	scav # KiB work (bg), # KiB work (eager), # KiB total, #% util
where the fields are as follows:
	# KiB work (bg)    the amount of memory returned to the OS in the background since
	                   the last line
	# KiB work (eager) the amount of memory returned to the OS eagerly since the last line
	# KiB now          the amount of address space currently returned to the OS
	#% util            the fraction of all unscavenged heap memory which is in-use
If the line ends with "(forced)", then scavenging was forced by a
debug.FreeOSMemory() call.

scheddetail: setting schedtrace=X and scheddetail=1 causes the scheduler to emit
detailed multiline info every X milliseconds, describing state of the scheduler,
processors, threads and goroutines.

schedtrace: setting schedtrace=X causes the scheduler to emit a single line to standard
error every X milliseconds, summarizing the scheduler state.

tracebackancestors: setting tracebackancestors=N extends tracebacks with the stacks at
which goroutines were created, where N limits the number of ancestor goroutines to
report. This also extends the information returned by runtime.Stack.
Setting N to 0 will report no ancestry information.

tracefpunwindoff: setting tracefpunwindoff=1 forces the execution tracer to
use the runtime's default stack unwinder instead of frame pointer unwinding.
This increases tracer overhead, but could be helpful as a workaround or for
debugging unexpected regressions caused by frame pointer unwinding.

traceadvanceperiod: the approximate period in nanoseconds between trace generations. Only
applies if a program is built with GOEXPERIMENT=exectracer2. Used primarily for testing
and debugging the execution tracer.

tracecheckstackownership: setting tracecheckstackownership=1 enables a debug check in the
execution tracer to double-check stack ownership before taking a stack trace.

asyncpreemptoff: asyncpreemptoff=1 disables signal-based
asynchronous goroutine preemption. This makes some loops
non-preemptible for long periods, which may delay GC and
goroutine scheduling. This is useful for debugging GC issues
because it also disables the conservative stack scanning used
for asynchronously preempted goroutines.
</pre> <p>The <span>net</span> and <span>net/http</span> packages also refer to debugging variables in GODEBUG. See the documentation for those packages for details. </p>
<p>The GOMAXPROCS variable limits the number of operating system threads that can execute user-level Go code simultaneously. There is no limit to the number of threads that can be blocked in system calls on behalf of Go code; those do not count against the GOMAXPROCS limit. This package's <a href="#GOMAXPROCS">GOMAXPROCS</a> function queries and changes the limit. </p>
<p>The GORACE variable configures the race detector, for programs built using -race. See the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/articles/race_detector">Race Detector article</a> for details. </p>
<p>The GOTRACEBACK variable controls the amount of output generated when a Go program fails due to an unrecovered panic or an unexpected runtime condition. By default, a failure prints a stack trace for the current goroutine, eliding functions internal to the run-time system, and then exits with exit code 2. The failure prints stack traces for all goroutines if there is no current goroutine or the failure is internal to the run-time. GOTRACEBACK=none omits the goroutine stack traces entirely. GOTRACEBACK=single (the default) behaves as described above. GOTRACEBACK=all adds stack traces for all user-created goroutines. GOTRACEBACK=system is like “all” but adds stack frames for run-time functions and shows goroutines created internally by the run-time. GOTRACEBACK=crash is like “system” but crashes in an operating system-specific manner instead of exiting. For example, on Unix systems, the crash raises SIGABRT to trigger a core dump. GOTRACEBACK=wer is like “crash” but doesn't disable Windows Error Reporting (WER). For historical reasons, the GOTRACEBACK settings 0, 1, and 2 are synonyms for none, all, and system, respectively. The <span>runtime/debug.SetTraceback</span> function allows increasing the amount of output at run time, but it cannot reduce the amount below that specified by the environment variable. </p>
<p>The GOARCH, GOOS, GOPATH, and GOROOT environment variables complete the set of Go environment variables. They influence the building of Go programs (see <span>cmd/go</span> and <span>go/build</span>). GOARCH, GOOS, and GOROOT are recorded at compile time and made available by constants or functions in this package, but they do not influence the execution of the run-time system. </p>
<h3 id="hdr-Security">Security</h3> <p>On Unix platforms, Go's runtime system behaves slightly differently when a binary is setuid/setgid or executed with setuid/setgid-like properties, in order to prevent dangerous behaviors. On Linux this is determined by checking for the AT_SECURE flag in the auxiliary vector, on the BSDs and Solaris/Illumos it is determined by checking the issetugid syscall, and on AIX it is determined by checking if the uid/gid match the effective uid/gid. </p>
<p>When the runtime determines the binary is setuid/setgid-like, it does three main things: </p>
<ul> <li>The standard input/output file descriptors (0, 1, 2) are checked to be open. If any of them are closed, they are opened pointing at /dev/null. </li>
<li>The value of the GOTRACEBACK environment variable is set to 'none'. </li>
<li>When a signal is received that terminates the program, or the program encounters an unrecoverable panic that would otherwise override the value of GOTRACEBACK, the goroutine stack, registers, and other memory related information are omitted. </li>

<h2 id="SetCgoTraceback">func <span>SetCgoTraceback</span>  <span title="Added in Go 1.7">1.7</span> </h2> <pre data-language="go">func SetCgoTraceback(version int, traceback, context, symbolizer unsafe.Pointer)</pre> <p>SetCgoTraceback records three C functions to use to gather traceback information from C code and to convert that traceback information into symbolic information. These are used when printing stack traces for a program that uses cgo. </p>
<p>The traceback and context functions may be called from a signal handler, and must therefore use only async-signal safe functions. The symbolizer function may be called while the program is crashing, and so must be cautious about using memory. None of the functions may call back into Go. </p>
<p>The context function will be called with a single argument, a pointer to a struct: </p>
<pre data-language="go">struct {
	Context uintptr
}
</pre> <p>In C syntax, this struct will be </p>
<pre data-language="go">struct {
	uintptr_t Context;
};
</pre> <p>If the Context field is 0, the context function is being called to record the current traceback context. It should record in the Context field whatever information is needed about the current point of execution to later produce a stack trace, probably the stack pointer and PC. In this case the context function will be called from C code. </p>
<p>If the Context field is not 0, then it is a value returned by a previous call to the context function. This case is called when the context is no longer needed; that is, when the Go code is returning to its C code caller. This permits the context function to release any associated resources. </p>
<p>While it would be correct for the context function to record a complete a stack trace whenever it is called, and simply copy that out in the traceback function, in a typical program the context function will be called many times without ever recording a traceback for that context. Recording a complete stack trace in a call to the context function is likely to be inefficient. </p>
<p>The traceback function will be called with a single argument, a pointer to a struct: </p>
<pre data-language="go">struct {
	Context    uintptr
	SigContext uintptr
	Buf        *uintptr
	Max        uintptr
}
</pre> <p>In C syntax, this struct will be </p>
<pre data-language="go">struct {
	uintptr_t  Context;
	uintptr_t  SigContext;
	uintptr_t* Buf;
	uintptr_t  Max;
};
</pre> <p>The Context field will be zero to gather a traceback from the current program execution point. In this case, the traceback function will be called from C code. </p>
<p>Otherwise Context will be a value previously returned by a call to the context function. The traceback function should gather a stack trace from that saved point in the program execution. The traceback function may be called from an execution thread other than the one that recorded the context, but only when the context is known to be valid and unchanging. The traceback function may also be called deeper in the call stack on the same thread that recorded the context. The traceback function may be called multiple times with the same Context value; it will usually be appropriate to cache the result, if possible, the first time this is called for a specific context value. </p>
<p>If the traceback function is called from a signal handler on a Unix system, SigContext will be the signal context argument passed to the signal handler (a C ucontext_t* cast to uintptr_t). This may be used to start tracing at the point where the signal occurred. If the traceback function is not called from a signal handler, SigContext will be zero. </p>
<p>Buf is where the traceback information should be stored. It should be PC values, such that Buf[0] is the PC of the caller, Buf[1] is the PC of that function's caller, and so on. Max is the maximum number of entries to store. The function should store a zero to indicate the top of the stack, or that the caller is on a different stack, presumably a Go stack. </p>
<p>Unlike runtime.Callers, the PC values returned should, when passed to the symbolizer function, return the file/line of the call instruction. No additional subtraction is required or appropriate. </p>
<p>On all platforms, the traceback function is invoked when a call from Go to C to Go requests a stack trace. On linux/amd64, linux/ppc64le, linux/arm64, and freebsd/amd64, the traceback function is also invoked when a signal is received by a thread that is executing a cgo call. The traceback function should not make assumptions about when it is called, as future versions of Go may make additional calls. </p>
<p>The symbolizer function will be called with a single argument, a pointer to a struct: </p>
<pre data-language="go">struct {
	PC      uintptr // program counter to fetch information for
	File    *byte   // file name (NUL terminated)
	Lineno  uintptr // line number
	Func    *byte   // function name (NUL terminated)
	Entry   uintptr // function entry point
	More    uintptr // set non-zero if more info for this PC
	Data    uintptr // unused by runtime, available for function
}
</pre> <p>In C syntax, this struct will be </p>
<pre data-language="go">struct {
	uintptr_t PC;
	char*     File;
	uintptr_t Lineno;
	char*     Func;
	uintptr_t Entry;
	uintptr_t More;
	uintptr_t Data;
};
</pre> <p>The PC field will be a value returned by a call to the traceback function. </p>
<p>The first time the function is called for a particular traceback, all the fields except PC will be 0. The function should fill in the other fields if possible, setting them to 0/nil if the information is not available. The Data field may be used to store any useful information across calls. The More field should be set to non-zero if there is more information for this PC, zero otherwise. If More is set non-zero, the function will be called again with the same PC, and may return different information (this is intended for use with inlined functions). If More is zero, the function will be called with the next PC value in the traceback. When the traceback is complete, the function will be called once more with PC set to zero; this may be used to free any information. Each call will leave the fields of the struct set to the same values they had upon return, except for the PC field when the More field is zero. The function must not keep a copy of the struct pointer between calls. </p>
<p>When calling SetCgoTraceback, the version argument is the version number of the structs that the functions expect to receive. Currently this must be zero. </p>
<p>The symbolizer function may be nil, in which case the results of the traceback function will be displayed as numbers. If the traceback function is nil, the symbolizer function will never be called. The context function may be nil, in which case the traceback function will only be called with the context field set to zero. If the context function is nil, then calls from Go to C to Go will not show a traceback for the C portion of the call stack. </p>
<p>SetCgoTraceback should be called only once, ideally from an init function. </p>
<h2 id="SetFinalizer">func <span>SetFinalizer</span>  </h2> <pre data-language="go">func SetFinalizer(obj any, finalizer any)</pre> <p>SetFinalizer sets the finalizer associated with obj to the provided finalizer function. When the garbage collector finds an unreachable block with an associated finalizer, it clears the association and runs finalizer(obj) in a separate goroutine. This makes obj reachable again, but now without an associated finalizer. Assuming that SetFinalizer is not called again, the next time the garbage collector sees that obj is unreachable, it will free obj. </p>
<p>SetFinalizer(obj, nil) clears any finalizer associated with obj. </p>
<p>New Go code should consider using <a href="#AddCleanup">AddCleanup</a> instead, which is much less error-prone than SetFinalizer. </p>
<p>The argument obj must be a pointer to an object allocated by calling new, by taking the address of a composite literal, or by taking the address of a local variable. The argument finalizer must be a function that takes a single argument to which obj's type can be assigned, and can have arbitrary ignored return values. If either of these is not true, SetFinalizer may abort the program. </p>
<p>Finalizers are run in dependency order: if A points at B, both have finalizers, and they are otherwise unreachable, only the finalizer for A runs; once A is freed, the finalizer for B can run. If a cyclic structure includes a block with a finalizer, that cycle is not guaranteed to be garbage collected and the finalizer is not guaranteed to run, because there is no ordering that respects the dependencies. </p>
<p>The finalizer is scheduled to run at some arbitrary time after the program can no longer reach the object to which obj points. There is no guarantee that finalizers will run before a program exits, so typically they are useful only for releasing non-memory resources associated with an object during a long-running program. For example, an <span>os.File</span> object could use a finalizer to close the associated operating system file descriptor when a program discards an os.File without calling Close, but it would be a mistake to depend on a finalizer to flush an in-memory I/O buffer such as a <span>bufio.Writer</span>, because the buffer would not be flushed at program exit. </p>
<p>It is not guaranteed that a finalizer will run if the size of *obj is zero bytes, because it may share same address with other zero-size objects in memory. See <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec#Size_and_alignment_guarantees">https://go.dev/ref/spec#Size_and_alignment_guarantees</a>. </p>
<p>It is not guaranteed that a finalizer will run for objects allocated in initializers for package-level variables. Such objects may be linker-allocated, not heap-allocated. </p>
<p>Note that because finalizers may execute arbitrarily far into the future after an object is no longer referenced, the runtime is allowed to perform a space-saving optimization that batches objects together in a single allocation slot. The finalizer for an unreferenced object in such an allocation may never run if it always exists in the same batch as a referenced object. Typically, this batching only happens for tiny (on the order of 16 bytes or less) and pointer-free objects. </p>
<p>A finalizer may run as soon as an object becomes unreachable. In order to use finalizers correctly, the program must ensure that the object is reachable until it is no longer required. Objects stored in global variables, or that can be found by tracing pointers from a global variable, are reachable. A function argument or receiver may become unreachable at the last point where the function mentions it. To make an unreachable object reachable, pass the object to a call of the <a href="#KeepAlive">KeepAlive</a> function to mark the last point in the function where the object must be reachable. </p>
<p>For example, if p points to a struct, such as os.File, that contains a file descriptor d, and p has a finalizer that closes that file descriptor, and if the last use of p in a function is a call to syscall.Write(p.d, buf, size), then p may be unreachable as soon as the program enters <span>syscall.Write</span>. The finalizer may run at that moment, closing p.d, causing syscall.Write to fail because it is writing to a closed file descriptor (or, worse, to an entirely different file descriptor opened by a different goroutine). To avoid this problem, call KeepAlive(p) after the call to syscall.Write. </p>
<p>A single goroutine runs all finalizers for a program, sequentially. If a finalizer must run for a long time, it should do so by starting a new goroutine. </p>
<p>In the terminology of the Go memory model, a call SetFinalizer(x, f) “synchronizes before” the finalization call f(x). However, there is no guarantee that KeepAlive(x) or any other use of x “synchronizes before” f(x), so in general a finalizer should use a mutex or other synchronization mechanism if it needs to access mutable state in x. For example, consider a finalizer that inspects a mutable field in x that is modified from time to time in the main program before x becomes unreachable and the finalizer is invoked. The modifications in the main program and the inspection in the finalizer need to use appropriate synchronization, such as mutexes or atomic updates, to avoid read-write races. </p>

<p>If ptr is reachable from cleanup or arg, ptr will never be collected and the cleanup will never run. As a protection against simple cases of this, AddCleanup panics if arg is equal to ptr. </p>
<p>There is no specified order in which cleanups will run. In particular, if several objects point to each other and all become unreachable at the same time, their cleanups all become eligible to run and can run in any order. This is true even if the objects form a cycle. </p>
<p>A single goroutine runs all cleanup calls for a program, sequentially. If a cleanup function must run for a long time, it should create a new goroutine. </p>
<p>If ptr has both a cleanup and a finalizer, the cleanup will only run once it has been finalized and becomes unreachable without an associated finalizer. </p>
<p>The cleanup(arg) call is not always guaranteed to run; in particular it is not guaranteed to run before program exit. </p>
<p>Cleanups are not guaranteed to run if the size of T is zero bytes, because it may share same address with other zero-size objects in memory. See <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec#Size_and_alignment_guarantees">https://go.dev/ref/spec#Size_and_alignment_guarantees</a>. </p>
<p>It is not guaranteed that a cleanup will run for objects allocated in initializers for package-level variables. Such objects may be linker-allocated, not heap-allocated. </p>
<p>Note that because cleanups may execute arbitrarily far into the future after an object is no longer referenced, the runtime is allowed to perform a space-saving optimization that batches objects together in a single allocation slot. The cleanup for an unreferenced object in such an allocation may never run if it always exists in the same batch as a referenced object. Typically, this batching only happens for tiny (on the order of 16 bytes or less) and pointer-free objects. </p>
<p>A cleanup may run as soon as an object becomes unreachable. In order to use cleanups correctly, the program must ensure that the object is reachable until it is safe to run its cleanup. Objects stored in global variables, or that can be found by tracing pointers from a global variable, are reachable. A function argument or receiver may become unreachable at the last point where the function mentions it. To ensure a cleanup does not get called prematurely, pass the object to the <a href="#KeepAlive">KeepAlive</a> function after the last point where the object must remain reachable. </p>
