<h2 id="ClientTrace">type <span>ClientTrace</span>  <span title="Added in Go 1.7">1.7</span> </h2> <p>ClientTrace is a set of hooks to run at various stages of an outgoing HTTP request.

<p>ClientTrace currently traces a single HTTP request &amp; response during a single round trip and has no hooks that span a series of redirected requests. </p>
