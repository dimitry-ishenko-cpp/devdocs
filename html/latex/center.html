</pre> <p>Create a new paragraph consisting of a sequence of lines that are centered within the left and right margins. Use double-backslash, <code>\\</code>, to get a line break (see <a href="_005c_005c.html"><code>\\</code></a>).  If some text is too long to fit on a line then LaTeX will insert line breaks that avoid hyphenation and avoid stretching or shrinking any interword space. </p> <p>This environment inserts space above and below the text body. See <a href="_005ccentering.html"><code>\centering</code></a> to avoid such space, for example inside a <code>figure</code> environment. </p> <p>This example produces three centered lines. There is extra vertical space between the last two lines. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{center}

</pre> <p>In this example, depending on the page’s line width, LaTeX may choose a line break for the part before the double backslash. If so, it will center each of the two lines and if not it will center the single line. Then LaTeX will break at the double backslash, and will center the ending. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{center}

</pre> <p>A double backslash after the final line is optional. If present it doesn’t add any vertical space. </p> <p>In a two-column document the text is centered in a column, not in the entire page. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="_005ccentering.html" accesskey="1"><code>\centering</code></a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
