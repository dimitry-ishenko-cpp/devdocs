<div class="subsection" id="Control-sequences">   <h4 class="subsection" id="Control-sequence_002c-control-word-and-control-symbol">Control sequence, control word and control symbol</h4>  <p>When reading input TeX converts sequences of read characters into a sequence of <em>tokens</em>. When TeX sees a backslash <code>\</code>, it will handle the following characters in a special way in order to make a <em>control sequence</em> token. </p> <p>The control sequences fall into two categories: </p> <ul> <li>  <em>control word</em>, when the control sequence is gathered from a <code>\</code> followed by at least one ASCII letter (<code>A-Z</code> and <code>a-z</code>), followed by at least one non-letter. </li>
<li>  <em>control symbol</em>, when the control sequence is gathered from a <code>\</code> followed by one non-letter character. </li>
</ul> <p>The sequence of characters so found after the <code>\</code> is also called the <em>control sequence name</em>. </p> <p>Blanks after a control word are ignored and do not produce any whitespace in the output (see <a href="_005cnewcommand-_0026-_005crenewcommand.html"><code>\newcommand</code> &amp; <code>\renewcommand</code></a> and <a href="_005c_0028space_0029.html">Backslash-space, <code>\ </code></a>). </p> <p>Just as the <code>\relax</code> command does nothing, the following input will simply print ‘<samp>Hello!</samp>’ : </p>  <pre data-language="latex">Hel\relax   
   lo!
</pre> <p>This is because blanks after <code>\relax</code>, including the newline, are ignored, and blanks at the beginning of a line are also ignored (see <a href="_005c_0028space_0029.html#Leading-blanks">Leading blanks</a>). </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
