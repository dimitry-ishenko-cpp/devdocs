</pre> <p>Bring material from the external file <samp><var>filename</var>.tex</samp> into a LaTeX document. </p> <p>The <code>\include</code> command does three things: it executes <code>\clearpage</code> (see <a href="_005cclearpage-_0026-_005ccleardoublepage.html"><code>\clearpage</code> &amp; <code>\cleardoublepage</code></a>), then it inputs the material from <samp><var>filename</var>.tex</samp> into the document, and then it does another <code>\clearpage</code>. This command can only appear in the document body. </p> <p>The <code>\includeonly</code> command controls which files will be read by LaTeX under subsequent <code>\include</code> commands. Its list of filenames is comma-separated. It must appear in the preamble or even earlier, e.g., the command line; it can’t appear in the document body. </p> <p>This example root document, <samp>constitution.tex</samp>, brings in three files, <samp>preamble.tex</samp>, <samp>articles.tex</samp>, and <samp>amendments.tex</samp>. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\documentclass{book}
\includeonly{
  preamble,
  articles,
  amendments
  }
\begin{document}
\include{preamble}
\include{articles}
\include{amendments}
\end{document}
</pre> <p>The file <samp>preamble.tex</samp> contains no special code; you have just excerpted the chapter from <samp>consitution.tex</samp> and put it in a separate file just for editing convenience. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\chapter{Preamble}
We the People of the United States,
in Order to form a more perfect Union, ...
</pre> <p>Running LaTeX on <samp>constitution.tex</samp> makes the material from the three files appear in the document but also generates the auxiliary files <samp>preamble.aux</samp>, <samp>articles.aux</samp>, and <samp>amendments.aux</samp>. These contain information such as page numbers and cross-references (see <a href="cross-references.html">Cross references</a>). If you now comment out <code>\includeonly</code>’s lines with <code>preamble</code> and <code>amendments</code> and run LaTeX again then the resulting document shows only the material from <samp>articles.tex</samp>, not the material from <samp>preamble.tex</samp> or <samp>amendments.tex</samp>. Nonetheless, all of the auxiliary information from the omitted files is still there, including the starting page number of the chapter. </p> <p>If the document preamble does not have <code>\includeonly</code> then LaTeX will include all the files you call for with <code>\include</code> commands. </p> <p>The <code>\include</code> command makes a new page. To avoid that, see <a href="_005cinput.html"><code>\input</code></a> (which, however, does not retain the auxiliary information). </p> <p>See <a href="larger-book-template.html">Larger <code>book</code> template</a>, for another example using <code>\include</code> and <code>\includeonly</code>. That example also uses <code>\input</code> for some material that will not necessarily start on a new page. </p> <p>File names can involve paths. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\documentclass{book}
\includeonly{
  chapters/chap1,
  }
\begin{document}
\include{chapters/chap1}
\end{document}
</pre> <p>To make your document portable across distributions and platforms you should avoid spaces in the file names. The tradition is to instead use dashes or underscores. Nevertheless, for the name ‘<samp>amo amas amat</samp>’, this works under TeX Live on GNU/Linux: </p>   <pre data-language="latex">\documentclass{book}
\includeonly{
  "amo\space amas\space amat"
  }
\begin{document}
\include{"amo\space amas\space amat"}
\end{document}
</pre> <p>and this works under MiKTeX on Windows: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\documentclass{book}
\includeonly{
  {"amo amas amat"}
  }
\begin{document}
\include{{"amo amas amat"}}
\end{document}
</pre>  <p>You cannot use <code>\include</code> inside a file that is being included or you get ‘<samp>LaTeX Error: \include cannot be nested.</samp>’ The <code>\include</code> command cannot appear in the document preamble; you will get ‘<samp>LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}</samp>’. </p> <p>If a file that you <code>\include</code> does not exist, for instance if you <code>\include{athiesm}</code> but you meant <code>\include{atheism}</code>, then LaTeX does not give you an error but will warn you ‘<samp>No file athiesm.tex.</samp>’ (It will also create <samp>athiesm.aux</samp>.) </p> <p>If you <code>\include</code> the root file in itself then you first get ‘<samp>LaTeX Error: Can be used only in preamble.</samp>’ Later runs get ‘<samp>TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [text input levels=15]</samp>’. To fix this, you must remove the inclusion <code>\include{<var>root</var>}</code> but also delete the file <samp><var>root</var>.aux</samp> and rerun LaTeX. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
