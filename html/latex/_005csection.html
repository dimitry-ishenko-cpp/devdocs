</pre> <p>Start a section. The standard LaTeX classes <code>article</code>, <code>book</code>, and <code>report</code> all have this command. </p> <p>This produces a section. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">In this Part we tend to be more interested in the function,
in the input-output behavior,
than in the details of implementing that behavior.

\section{Turing machines}
Despite this desire to downplay implementation,
we follow the approach of A~Turing that the
first step toward defining the set of computable functions
is to reflect on the details of what mechanisms can do.
</pre> <p>For the standard LaTeX classes <code>book</code> and <code>report</code> the default output is like ‘<samp>1.2 <var>title</var></samp>’ (for chapter 1, section 2), alone on its line and flush left, in boldface and a larger type (the type size is <code>\Large</code>). The same holds in <code>article</code> except that there are no chapters in that class so it looks like ‘<samp>2 <var>title</var></samp>’. </p> <p>The <code>*</code> form shows <var>title</var>. But it does not show the section number, does not increment the <code>section</code> counter, produces no table of contents entry, and does not affect the running header. (If you use the page style <code>headings</code> in a two-sided document then the header will be from the prior section.) </p> <p>The optional argument <var>toc-title</var> will appear as the section title in the table of contents (see <a href="table-of-contents-etc_002e.html">Table of contents, list of figures, list of tables</a>) and in running headers (see <a href="page-styles.html">Page styles</a>). If it is not present then <var>title</var> will be there. This shows the full name in the title of the section: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\section[Elizabeth~II]{Elizabeth the Second,
  by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom,
  Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen,
  Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.}
</pre> <p>but only ‘<samp>Elizabeth II</samp>’ on the contents page and in the headers. This has a line break in <var>title</var> but that does not work with headers so it is omitted from the contents and headers. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\section[Truth is, I cheated; my life story]{Truth is,
  I cheated\\my life story}
</pre> <p>For determining which sectional units are numbered and which appear in the table of contents, the level number of a section is 1 (see <a href="sectioning.html#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth">Sectioning/secnumdepth</a> and see <a href="sectioning.html#Sectioning_002ftocdepth">Sectioning/tocdepth</a>). </p>   <p>The paragraph that follows the section title is not indented, as is a standard typographical practice. One way to get an indent is to use the package <code>indentfirst</code>. </p>   <p>In general, to change the behavior of the <code>\section</code> command, there are a number of options. One is the <code>\@startsection</code> command (see <a href="_005c_0040startsection.html"><code>\@startsection</code>, typesetting sectional unit headings</a>). There are also many packages on CTAN that address this, including <code>titlesec</code>. See the documentation but the example below gives a sense of what they can do. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\usepackage{titlesec}   % in preamble
\titleformat{\section}
  {\normalfont\Large\bfseries}  % format of title
  {\makebox[1pc][r]{\thesection\hspace{1pc}}} % label
  {0pt}                   % length of separation between label and title
  {}                      % before-code hook
\titlespacing*{\section}
  {-1pc}{18pt}{10pt}[10pc]
</pre> <p>That puts the section number in the margin. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
