<div class="section" id="Class-and-package-construction">   <h3 class="section" id="Class-and-package-construction">Class and package construction</h3>    <p>You can create new document classes and new packages. For instance, if your memos must satisfy some local requirements, such as a standard header for each page, then you could create a new class <code>smcmemo.cls</code> and begin your documents with <code>\documentclass{smcmemo}</code>. </p> <p>What separates a package from a document class is that the commands in a package are useful across classes while those in a document class are specific to that class. Thus, a command to set page headers is for a package while a command to make the page headers say <code>Memo from the
SMC Math Department</code> is for a class.   </p> <p>Inside of a class or package file you can use the at-sign <code>@</code> as a character in command names without having to surround the code containing that command with <code>\makeatletter</code> and <code>\makeatother</code>. See <a href="_005cmakeatletter-_0026-_005cmakeatother.html"><code>\makeatletter</code> &amp; <code>\makeatother</code></a>. This allow you to create commands that users will not accidentally redefine. Another technique is to preface class- or package-specific commands with some string to prevent your class or package from interfering with others. For instance, the class <code>smcmemo</code> might have commands <code>\smc@tolist</code>, <code>\smc@fromlist</code>, etc. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="class-and-package-structure.html" accesskey="1">Class and package structure</a></li> <li><a href="class-and-package-commands.html" accesskey="2">Class and package commands</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
