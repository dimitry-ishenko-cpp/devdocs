<div class="subsection" id="g_t_005cmulticolumn">   <h4 class="subsection" id="g_t_005cmulticolumn">\multicolumn</h4>  <p>Synopsis: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\multicolumn{<var>numcols</var>}{<var>cols</var>}{<var>text</var>}
</pre> <p>Make an <code>array</code> or <code>tabular</code> entry that spans several columns. The first argument <var>numcols</var> gives the number of columns to span. The second argument <var>cols</var> specifies the formatting of the entry, with <code>c</code> for centered, <code>l</code> for flush left, or <code>r</code> for flush right. The third argument <var>text</var> gives the contents of that entry. </p> <p>In this example, in the first row, the second and third columns are spanned by the single heading ‘<samp>Name</samp>’. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{tabular}{lccl} 
  \textit{ID}       &amp;\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Name}} &amp;\textit{Age} \\
  \hline  
  978-0-393-03701-2 &amp;O'Brian &amp;Patrick                  &amp;55           \\
    ...
\end{tabular}
</pre> <p>What counts as a column is: the column format specifier for the <code>array</code> or <code>tabular</code> environment is broken into parts, where each part (except the first) begins with <code>l</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>r</code>, or <code>p</code>. So from <code>\begin{tabular}{|r|ccp{1.5in}|}</code> the parts are <code>|r|</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>c</code>, and <code>p{1.5in}|</code>. </p> <p>The <var>cols</var> argument overrides the <code>array</code> or <code>tabular</code> environment’s intercolumn area default adjoining this multicolumn entry. To affect that area, this argument can contain vertical bars <code>|</code> indicating the placement of vertical rules, and <code>@{...}</code> expressions. Thus if <var>cols</var> is ‘<samp>|c|</samp>’ then this multicolumn entry will be centered and a vertical rule will come in the intercolumn area before it and after it. This table details the exact behavior. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{tabular}{|cc|c|c|}
  \multicolumn{1}{r}{w}       % entry one
    &amp;\multicolumn{1}{|r|}{x}  % entry two 
    &amp;\multicolumn{1}{|r}{y}   % entry three
    &amp;z                        % entry four
\end{tabular}
</pre> <p>Before the first entry the output will not have a vertical rule because the <code>\multicolumn</code> has the <var>cols</var> specifier ‘<samp>r</samp>’ with no initial vertical bar. Between entry one and entry two there will be a vertical rule; although the first <var>cols</var> does not have an ending vertical bar, the second <var>cols</var> does have a starting one. Between entry two and entry three there is a single vertical rule; despite that the <var>cols</var> in both of the surrounding <code>multicolumn</code>’s call for a vertical rule, you only get one rule. Between entry three and entry four there is no vertical rule; the default calls for one but the <var>cols</var> in the entry three <code>\multicolumn</code> leaves it out, and that takes precedence. Finally, following entry four there is a vertical rule because of the default. </p> <p>The number of spanned columns <var>numcols</var> can be 1. Besides giving the ability to change the horizontal alignment, this also is useful to override for one row the <code>tabular</code> definition’s default intercolumn area specification, including the placement of vertical rules. </p> <p>In the example below, in the <code>tabular</code> definition the first column is specified to default to left justified but in the first row the entry is centered with <code>\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textsc{Period}}</code>. Also in the first row, the second and third columns are spanned by a single entry with <code>\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textsc{Span}}</code>, overriding the specification to center those two columns on the page range en-dash. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{tabular}{l|r@{--}l} 
  \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textsc{Period}}  
    &amp;\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textsc{Span}} \\ \hline
  Baroque          &amp;1600           &amp;1760         \\
  Classical        &amp;1730           &amp;1820         \\
  Romantic         &amp;1780           &amp;1910         \\
  Impressionistic  &amp;1875           &amp;1925
\end{tabular}
</pre> <p>Although the <code>tabular</code> specification by default puts a vertical rule between the first and second columns, no such vertical rule appears in the first row here. That’s because there is no vertical bar in the <var>cols</var> part of the first row’s first <code>\multicolumn</code> command. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
