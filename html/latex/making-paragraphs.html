<div class="chapter" id="Making-paragraphs">   <h2 class="chapter" id="Making-paragraphs">Making paragraphs</h2>   <p>To start a paragraph, just type some text. To end the current paragraph, put an empty line. This is three paragraphs, the separation of which is made by two empty lines. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.

``My dear Mr. Bennet,'' said his lady to him one day,
``have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?''
</pre> <p>A paragraph separator is made of a sequence of at least one blank line, at least one of which is not terminated by a comment. A blank line is a line that is empty or made only of blank characters such as space or tab. Comments in source code are started with a <code>%</code> and span up to the end of line. In the following example the two columns are identical: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\documentclass[twocolumn]{article}
\begin{document}
First paragraph.

Second paragraph.
\newpage
First paragraph.
      
  % separator lines may contain blank characters.
  		
Second paragraph.
\end{document}
</pre> <p>Once LaTeX has gathered all of a paragraph’s contents it divides that content into lines in a way that is optimized over the entire paragraph (see <a href="line-breaking.html">Line breaking</a>). </p> <p>There are places where a new paragraph is not permitted. Don’t put a blank line in math mode (see <a href="modes.html">Modes</a>); here the blank line before the <code>\end{equation}</code> </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{equation}
  2^{|S|} &gt; |S|

\end{equation}
</pre> <p>will get you the error ‘<samp>Missing $ inserted</samp>’. Similarly, the blank line in this <code>\section</code> argument </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\section{aaa

bbb}
</pre> <p>gets ‘<samp>Runaway argument? {aaa ! Paragraph ended before \@sect was complete</samp>’. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="_005cpar.html" accesskey="1"><code>\par</code></a></li> <li><a href="_005cindent-_0026-_005cnoindent.html" accesskey="2"><code>\indent</code> &amp; <code>\noindent</code></a></li> <li><a href="_005cparindent-_0026-_005cparskip.html" accesskey="3"><code>\parindent</code> &amp; <code>\parskip</code></a></li> <li><a href="marginal-notes.html" accesskey="4">Marginal notes</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
