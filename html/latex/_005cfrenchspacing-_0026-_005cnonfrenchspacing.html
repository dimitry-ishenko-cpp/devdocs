</pre> <p>The first declaration causes LaTeX to handle spacing between sentences in the same way as spacing between words in the middle of a sentence. The second switches back to the default handling in which spacing between sentences stretches or shrinks more (see <a href="_005cspacefactor.html"><code>\spacefactor</code></a>). </p> <p>Some typographic traditions, including English, prefer to adjust the space between sentences (or spaces following a question mark, exclamation point, comma, or colon) more than the space between words that are in the middle of a sentence. Declaring <code>\frenchspacing</code> (the command is from plain TeX) switches to the tradition that all spaces are treated equally. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
