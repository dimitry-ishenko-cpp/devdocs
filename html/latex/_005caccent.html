<div class="subsection" id="g_t_005caccent">   <h4 class="subsection" id="g_t_005caccent">\accent</h4>  <p>Synopsis: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\accent <var>number</var> <var>character</var>
</pre> <p>A TeX primitive command used to generate accented characters from accent marks and letters. The accent mark is selected by <var>number</var>, a numeric argument, followed by a space and then a <var>character</var> argument to construct the accented character in the current font. </p> <p>These are accented ‘<samp>e</samp>’ characters. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\accent18 e
\accent20 e
\accent21 e
\accent22 e
\accent23 e
</pre> <p>The first is a grave, the second a caron, the third a breve, the fourth a macron, and the fifth a ring above. </p> <p>The position of the accent is determined by the font designer and so the outcome of <code>\accent</code> use may differ between fonts. In LaTeX it is desirable to have glyphs for accented characters rather than building them using <code>\accent</code>. Using glyphs that already contain the accented characters (as in T1 encoding) allows correct hyphenation whereas <code>\accent</code> disables hyphenation (specifically with OT1 font encoding where accented glyphs are absent). </p> <p>There can be an optional font change between <var>number</var> and <var>character</var>. Note also that this command sets the <code>\spacefactor</code> to 1000 (see <a href="_005cspacefactor.html"><code>\spacefactor</code></a>). </p> <p>An unavoidable characteristic of some Cyrillic letters and the majority of accented Cyrillic letters is that they must be assembled from multiple elements (accents, modifiers, etc.) while <code>\accent</code> provides for a single accent mark and a single letter combination. There are also cases where accents must appear between letters that \accent does not support. Still other cases exist where the letters I and J have dots above their lowercase counterparts that conflict with dotted accent marks. The use of <code>\accent</code> in these cases will not work as it cannot analyze upper/lower case. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
