<div class="subsection" id="g_t_005ccentering">   <h4 class="subsection" id="g_t_005ccentering">\centering</h4>   <p>Synopsis: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">{\centering ... }
</pre> <p>or </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{group}
  \centering ...
\end{group}
</pre> <p>Center the material in its scope. It is most often used inside an environment such as <code>figure</code>, or in a <code>parbox</code>. </p> <p>This example’s <code>\centering</code> declaration causes the graphic to be horizontally centered. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ctan_lion.png}
  \caption{CTAN Lion}  \label{fig:CTANLion}
\end{figure}
</pre> <p>The scope of this <code>\centering</code> ends with the <code>\end{figure}</code>. </p> <p>Unlike the <code>center</code> environment, the <code>\centering</code> command does not add vertical space above and below the text. That’s its advantage in the above example; there is not an excess of space. </p> <p>It also does not start a new paragraph; it simply changes how LaTeX formats paragraph units. If <code>ww {\centering xx \\ yy} zz</code> is surrounded by blank lines then LaTeX will create a paragraph whose first line ‘<samp>ww xx</samp>’ is centered and whose second line, not centered, contains ‘<samp>yy zz</samp>’. Usually what is desired is for the scope of the declaration to contain a blank line or the <code>\end</code> command of an environment such as <code>figure</code> or <code>table</code> that ends the paragraph unit. Thus, if <code>{\centering xx \\ yy\par} zz</code> is surrounded by blank lines then it makes a new paragraph with two centered lines ‘<samp>xx</samp>’ and ‘<samp>yy</samp>’, followed by a new paragraph with ‘<samp>zz</samp>’ that is formatted as usual. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
