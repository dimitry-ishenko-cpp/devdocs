\makebox[\linewidth][c]{\textit{Shut Not Your Doors} ---Walt Whitman}
  \\[1\baselineskip]
Shut not your doors to me proud libraries,                  \\
For that which was lacking on all your well-fill'd shelves, \\
\qquad yet needed most, I bring,                             \\
Forth from the war emerging, a book I have made,            \\
The words of my book nothing, the drift of it every thing,  \\
A book separate, not link'd with the rest nor felt by the intellect, \\
But you ye untold latencies will thrill to every page.
\end{verse}
