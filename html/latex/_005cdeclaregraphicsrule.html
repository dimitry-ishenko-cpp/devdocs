<div class="subsection" id="g_t_005cDeclareGraphicsRule">   <h4 class="subsection" id="g_t_005cDeclareGraphicsRule">\DeclareGraphicsRule</h4>  <p>Synopsis: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\DeclareGraphicsRule{<var>extension</var>}{<var>type</var>}{<var>size-file extension</var>}{<var>command</var>}
</pre> <p>Declare how to handle graphic files whose names end in <var>extension</var>. </p> <p>This example declares that all files with names of the form <samp>filename-without-dot.mps</samp> will be treated as output from MetaPost, meaning that the printer driver will use its MetaPost-handling code to input the file. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\DeclareGraphicsRule{.mps}{mps}{.mps}{}
</pre> <p>This </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{mps}{*}{}
</pre> <p>tells LaTeX that it should handle as MetaPost output any file with an extension not covered by another rule, so it covers <samp>filename.1</samp>, <samp>filename.2</samp>, etc. </p> <p>This describes the four arguments. </p> <dl compact> <dt><span><var>extension</var></span></dt> <dd>
<p>The file extension to which this rule applies. The extension is anything after and including the first dot in the filename. Use the Kleene star, <code>*</code>, to denote the default behavior for all undeclared extensions. </p> </dd> <dt><span><var>type</var></span></dt> <dd>
<p>The type of file involved. This type is a string that must be defined in the printer driver. For instance, files with extensions <samp>.ps</samp>, <samp>.eps</samp>, or <samp>.ps.gz</samp> may all be classed as type <code>eps</code>. All files of the same type will be input with the same internal command by the printer driver. For example, the file types that <samp>pdftex</samp> recognizes are: <code>jpg</code>, <code>jbig2</code>, <code>mps</code>, <code>pdf</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>tif</code>. </p> </dd> <dt><span><var>size-file extension</var></span></dt> <dd>
<p>The extension of the file to be read to determine the size of the graphic, if there is such a file. It may be the same as <var>extension</var> but it may be different. </p> <p>As an example, consider a PostScript graphic. To make it smaller, it might be compressed into a <samp>.ps.gz</samp> file. Compressed files are not easily read by LaTeX so you can put the bounding box information in a separate file. If <var>size-file extension</var> is empty then you must specify size information in the arguments of <code>\includegraphics</code>. </p> <p>If the driver file has a procedure for reading size files for <code>type</code> then that will be used, otherwise it will use the procedure for reading <samp>.eps</samp> files. (Thus you may specify the size of bitmap files in a file with a PostScript style <code>%%BoundingBox</code> line if no other format is available.) </p> </dd> <dt><span><var>command</var></span></dt> <dd>
<p>A command that will be applied to the file. This is very often left empty. This command must start with a single backward quote. Thus, <code>\DeclareGraphicsRule{.eps.gz}{eps}{.eps.bb}{`gunzip -c
#1}</code> specifies that any file with the extension <samp>.eps.gz</samp> should be treated as an <code>eps</code> file, with the BoundingBox information stored in the file with extension <samp>.eps.bb</samp>, and that the command <code>gunzip -c</code> will run on your platform to decompresses the file. </p> <p>Such a command is specific to your platform. In addition, your TeX system must allow you to run external commands; as a security measure modern systems restrict running commands unless you explicitly allow it. See the documentation for your TeX distribution. </p> </dd> </dl> </div><div class="_attribution">
