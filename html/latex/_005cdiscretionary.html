</pre> <p>Handle word changes around hyphens. This command is not often used in LaTeX documents. </p> <p>If a line break occurs at the point where <code>\discretionary</code> appears then TeX puts <var>pre-break</var> at the end of the current line and puts <var>post-break</var> at the start of the next line. If there is no line break here then TeX puts <var>no-break</var>. </p> <p>In ‘<samp>difficult</samp>’ the three letters <code>ffi</code> form a ligature. But TeX can nonetheless break between the two ‘<samp>f</samp>’’s with this. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">di\discretionary{f-}{fi}{ffi}cult
</pre> <p>Note that users do not have to do this. It is typically handled automatically by TeX’s hyphenation algorithm. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
