<div class="subsection" id="g_t_005cwrite-and-security">   <h4 class="subsection" id="g_t_005cwrite-and-security">\write and security</h4>   <p>The ability to write files raises security issues. If you compiled a downloaded LaTeX file and it overwrote your password file then you would be justifiably troubled. </p> <p>Thus, by default TeX systems only allow you to open files for writing that are in the current directory or output directory, if specified (see <a href="command-line-options.html#output-directory">output directory</a>), or in a subdirectory of those. So, this code </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\newwrite\jhfile
\openout\jhfile=../test.jh
</pre> <p>gives an error like: </p> <pre data-language="latex">Not writing to ../test.jh (openout_any = p).
! I can't write on file `../test.jh'
</pre>  <p>You can get just such an error when using commands such as <code>\include{../filename}</code> because LaTeX will try to open <samp>../filename.aux</samp>. The simplest solution is to put the included files in the same directory as the root file, or in subdirectories. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
