\chapter*{<var>title</var>}
\chapter[<var>toc-title</var>]{<var>title</var>}
</pre> <p>Start a chapter. The standard LaTeX classes <code>book</code> and <code>report</code> have this command but <code>article</code> does not. </p> <p>This produces a chapter. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\chapter{Loomings}
Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago---never mind how long precisely---having little or no
money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I
thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
the world.
</pre> <p>The LaTeX default starts each chapter on a fresh page, an odd-numbered page if the document is two-sided. It produces a chapter number such as ‘<samp>Chapter 1</samp>’ in large boldface type (the size is <code>\huge</code>). It then puts <var>title</var> on a fresh line, in boldface type that is still larger (size <code>\Huge</code>). It also increments the <code>chapter</code> counter, adds an entry to the table of contents (see <a href="table-of-contents-etc_002e.html">Table of contents, list of figures, list of tables</a>), and sets the running header information (see <a href="page-styles.html">Page styles</a>). </p> <p>The <code>*</code> form shows <var>title</var> on a fresh line, in boldface. But it does not show the chapter number, does not increment the <code>chapter</code> counter, produces no table of contents entry, and does not affect the running header. (If you use the page style <code>headings</code> in a two-sided document then the header will be from the prior chapter.) This example illustrates. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\chapter*{Preamble}
</pre> <p>The optional argument <var>toc-title</var> will appear as the chapter title in the table of contents (see <a href="table-of-contents-etc_002e.html">Table of contents, list of figures, list of tables</a>) and in running headers (see <a href="page-styles.html">Page styles</a>). If it is not present then <var>title</var> will be there. This shows the full name in the chapter title, </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\chapter[Weyl]{Hermann Klaus Hugo (Peter) Weyl (1885--1955)}
</pre> <p>but only ‘<samp>Weyl</samp>’ on the contents page. This puts a line break in the title but that doesn’t work well with running headers so it omits the break in the contents </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\chapter[Given it all; my story]{Given it all\\ my story}
</pre> <p>For determining which sectional units are numbered and which appear in the table of contents, the level number of a chapter is 0 (see <a href="sectioning.html#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth">Sectioning/secnumdepth</a> and see <a href="sectioning.html#Sectioning_002ftocdepth">Sectioning/tocdepth</a>). </p>   <p>The paragraph that follows the chapter title is not indented, as is a standard typographical practice. To get an indent use the package <code>indentfirst</code>. </p> <p>You can change what is shown for the chapter number. To change it to something like ‘<samp>Lecture 1</samp>’, put in the preamble either <code>\renewcommand{\chaptername}{Lecture}</code> or this (see <a href="_005cmakeatletter-_0026-_005cmakeatother.html"><code>\makeatletter</code> &amp; <code>\makeatother</code></a>). </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\makeatletter
\renewcommand{\@chapapp}{Lecture}
\makeatother
</pre>   <p>To make this change because of the primary language for the document, see the package <code>babel</code>. </p> <p>In a two-sided document LaTeX puts a chapter on odd-numbered page, if necessary leaving an even-numbered page that is blank except for any running headers. To make that page completely blank, see <a href="_005cclearpage-_0026-_005ccleardoublepage.html"><code>\clearpage</code> &amp; <code>\cleardoublepage</code></a>. </p>   <p>To change the behavior of the <code>\chapter</code> command, you can copy its definition from the LaTeX format file and make adjustments. But there are also many packages on CTAN that address this. One is <code>titlesec</code>. See its documentation, but the example below gives a sense of what it can do. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\usepackage{titlesec}   % in preamble
\titleformat{\chapter}
  {\Huge\bfseries}  % format of title
  {}                % label, such as 1.2 for a subsection
  {0pt}             % length of separation between label and title
  {}                % before-code hook
</pre> <p>This omits the chapter number ‘<samp>Chapter 1</samp>’ from the page but unlike <code>\chapter*</code> it keeps the chapter in the table of contents and the running headers. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
