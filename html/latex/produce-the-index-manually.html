<div class="subsection" id="Produce-the-index-manually">   <h4 class="subsection" id="Produce-the-index-manually">Produce the index manually</h4>   <p>Documents that are small and static can have a manually produced index. This will make a separate page labeled ‘<samp>Index</samp>’, in twocolumn format. </p>    <pre data-language="latex">\begin{theindex}
\item acorn squash, 1
\subitem maple baked, 2
\indexspace
\item bacon, 3
\subitem maple baked, 4
\end{theindex}
</pre> <p>Note that the author must enter the page numbers, which is tedious and which will result in wrong numbers if the document changes. This is why in most cases automated methods such as <code>makeindex</code> are best. See <a href="indexes.html">Indexes</a>. </p>     <p>However we cover the commands for completeness, and because the automated methods are based on these commands. There are three levels of entries. As the example shows, a main entry uses <code>\item</code>, subentries use <code>\subitem</code>, and the lowest level uses <code>\subsubitem</code>. Blank lines between entries have no effect. The example above includes <code>\indexspace</code> to produce vertical space in the output that some index styles use before the first entry starting with a new letter. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
