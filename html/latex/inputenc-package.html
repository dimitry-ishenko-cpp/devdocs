<div class="section" id="inputenc-package">   <h3 class="section" id="inputenc-package">inputenc package</h3>  <p>Synopsis: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\usepackage[<var>encoding-name</var>]{inputenc}
</pre> <p>Declare the input file’s text encoding to be <var>encoding-name</var>. The default, if this package is not loaded, is UTF-8. Technically, specifying the encoding name is optional, but in practice it is not useful to omit it. </p>    <p>In a computer file, the characters are stored according to a scheme called the <em>encoding</em>. There are many different encodings. The simplest is ASCII, which supports 95 printable characters, not enough for most of the world’s languages. For instance, to typeset the a-umlaut character ‘<samp>ä</samp>’ in an ASCII-encoded LaTeX source file, the sequence <code>\"a</code> is used. This would make source files for anything but English hard to read; even for English, often a more extensive encoding is more convenient. </p> <p>The modern encoding standard, in some ways a union of the others, is UTF-8, one of the representations of Unicode. This is the default for LaTeX since 2018. </p> <p>The <code>inputenc</code> package is how LaTeX knows what encoding is used. For instance, the following command explicitly says that the input file is UTF-8 (note the lack of a dash). </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
</pre> <p>Caution: use <code>inputenc</code> only with the pdfTeX engine (see <a href="tex-engines.html">TeX engines</a>). (The XeTeX and LuaTeX engines assume that the input file is UTF-8 encoded.) If you invoke LaTeX with either the <code>xelatex</code> command or the <code>lualatex</code> command, and try to declare a non-UTF-8 encoding with <code>inputenc</code>, such as <code>latin1</code>, then you will get the error <code>inputenc is
not designed for xetex or luatex</code>. </p> <p>An <code>inputenc</code> package error such as <code>Invalid UTF-8 byte "96</code> means that some of the material in the input file does not follow the encoding scheme. Often these errors come from copying material from a document that uses a different encoding than the input file; this one is a left single quote from a web page using <code>latin1</code> inside a LaTeX input file that uses UTF-8. The simplest solution is to replace the non-UTF-8 character with its UTF-8 equivalent, or use a LaTeX equivalent command or character. </p>  <p>In some documents, such as a collection of journal articles from a variety of authors, changing the encoding in mid-document may be necessary. Use the command <code>\inputencoding{<var>encoding-name</var>}</code>. The most common values for <var>encoding-name</var> are: <code>ascii</code>, <code>latin1</code>, <code>latin2</code>, <code>latin3</code>, <code>latin4</code>, <code>latin5</code>, <code>latin9</code>, <code>latin10</code>, and <code>utf8</code>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
