  ... definition of commands with @ in their name ..
\makeatother
</pre> <p>Use this pair when you redefine LaTeX commands that are named with an at-sign character ‘<samp><code>@</code></samp>’. The <code>\makeatletter</code> declaration makes the at-sign character have the category code of a letter, code 11. The <code>\makeatother</code> declaration sets the category code of the at-sign to code 12, its default value. </p> <p>As TeX reads characters, it assigns each one a category code, or    <em>catcode</em>. For instance, it assigns the backslash character ‘<samp><code>\</code></samp>’ the catcode 0. Command names consist of a category 0 character, ordinarily backslash, followed by letters, category 11 characters (except that a command name can also consist of a category 0 character followed by a single non-letter symbol). </p> <p>LaTeX’s source code has the convention that some commands use <code>@</code> in their name. These commands are mainly intended for package or class writers. The convention prevents authors who are just using a package or class from accidentally replacing such a command with one of their own, because by default the at-sign has catcode 12. </p> <p>Use the pair <code>\makeatletter</code> and <code>\makeatother</code> inside a <samp>.tex</samp> file, typically in the preamble, when you are defining or redefining commands named with <code>@</code>, by having them surround your definition. Don’t use these inside <samp>.sty</samp> or <samp>.cls</samp> files since the <code>\usepackage</code> and <code>\documentclass</code> commands already arrange that the at-sign has the character code of a letter, catcode 11. </p>   <p>For a comprehensive list of macros with an at-sign in their names see <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/macros2e">https://ctan.org/pkg/macros2e</a>. </p> <p>In this example the class file has a command <code>\thesis@universityname</code> that the user wants to change. These three lines should go in the preamble, before the <code>\begin{document}</code>. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\makeatletter
