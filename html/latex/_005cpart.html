</pre> <p>Start a document part. The standard LaTeX classes <code>book</code>, <code>report</code>, and <code>article</code>, all have this command. </p> <p>This produces a document part, in a book. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\part{VOLUME I \\

\chapter{ANCESTRY--BIRTH--BOYHOOD.}
My family is American, and has been for generations,
in all its branches, direct and collateral.
</pre> <p>In each standard class the <code>\part</code> command outputs a part number such as ‘<samp>Part I</samp>’, alone on its line, in boldface, and in large type. Then LaTeX outputs <var>title</var>, also alone on its line, in bold and in even larger type. In class <code>book</code>, the LaTeX default puts each part alone on its own page. If the book is two-sided then LaTeX will skip a page if needed to have the new part on an odd-numbered page. In <code>report</code> it is again alone on a page, but LaTeX won’t force it onto an odd-numbered page. In an <code>article</code> LaTeX does not put it on a fresh page, but instead outputs the part number and part title onto the main document page. </p> <p>The <code>*</code> form shows <var>title</var> but it does not show the part number, does not increment the <code>part</code> counter, and produces no table of contents entry. </p> <p>The optional argument <var>toc-title</var> will appear as the part title in the table of contents (see <a href="table-of-contents-etc_002e.html">Table of contents, list of figures, list of tables</a>) and in running headers (see <a href="page-styles.html">Page styles</a>). If it is not present then <var>title</var> will be there. This example puts a line break in <var>title</var> but omits the break in the table of contents. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\part[Up from the bottom; my life]{Up from the bottom\\ my life}
</pre> <p>For determining which sectional units are numbered and which appear in the table of contents, the level number of a part is -1 (see <a href="sectioning.html#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth">Sectioning/secnumdepth</a>, and <a href="sectioning.html#Sectioning_002ftocdepth">Sectioning/tocdepth</a>). </p>   <p>In the class <code>article</code>, if a paragraph immediately follows the part title then it is not indented. To get an indent you can use the package <code>indentfirst</code>. </p>   <p>One package to change the behavior of <code>\part</code> is <code>titlesec</code>. See its documentation on CTAN. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
