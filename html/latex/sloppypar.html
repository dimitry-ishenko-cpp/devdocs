  book after breakfast, resolving to remain in the same place and the

  whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such, that
  as she never talked a great deal, so she could never be entirely
  silent; and, therefore, while she sat at her work, if she lost her
  needle or broke her thread, if she heard a carriage in the street,
  or saw a speck upon her gown, she must observe it aloud, whether
  there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not.
