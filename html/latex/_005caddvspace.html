<div class="section" id="g_t_005caddvspace">   <h3 class="section" id="g_t_005caddvspace">\addvspace</h3>    <p>Synopsis: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\addvspace{<var>vert-length</var>}
</pre> <p>Add a vertical space of <var>vert-length</var>. However, if there are two or more <code>\addvspace</code>’s in a sequence then together they only add the space needed to make the natural length equal to the maximum of the <var>vert-length</var>’s in that sequence. This command is fragile (see <a href="_005cprotect.html"><code>\protect</code></a>). The <var>vert-length</var> is a rubber length (see <a href="lengths.html">Lengths</a>). </p> <p>This example illustrates. The <code>picture</code> draws a scale over which to rules are placed. In a standard LaTeX article the length <code>\baselineskip</code> is 12pt. As shown by the scale, the two rules are 22pt apart: the sum of the <code>\baselineskip</code> and the 10pt from the first <code>\addvspace</code>. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\documentclass{article}

  \multiput(0,0)(0,-1){25}{{\color{blue}\line(1,0){1}}}
  \multiput(0,0)(0,-5){6}{{\color{red}\line(1,0){2}}}

</pre> <p>Now uncomment the second <code>\addvspace</code>. It does not make the gap 20pt longer; instead the gap is the sum of <code>\baselineskip</code> and 20pt. So <code>\addvspace</code> in a sense does the opposite of its name—it makes sure that multiple vertical spaces do not accumulate, but instead that only the largest one is used. </p> <p>LaTeX uses this command to adjust the vertical space above or below an environment that starts a new paragraph. For instance, a <code>theorem</code> environment begins and ends with <code>\addvspace</code> so that two consecutive <code>theorem</code>’s are separated by one vertical space, not two. </p> <p>A error ‘<samp>Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item</samp>’ pointing to an <code>\addvspace</code> means that you were not in vertical mode when you hit this command. One way to change that is to precede <code>\addvspace</code> with a <code>\par</code> command (see <a href="_005cpar.html"><code>\par</code></a>), as in the above example. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
