\newcommand{...}{...\xspace}
</pre> <p>The <code>\xspace</code> macro, when used at the end of a command definition, adds a space unless the command is followed by certain punctuation characters. </p> <p>After a command control sequence that is a control word (see <a href="control-sequences.html">Control sequence, control word and control symbol</a>, as opposed to control symbols such as <code>\$</code>), TeX gobbles blank characters. Thus, in the first sentence below, the output has ‘<samp>Vermont</samp>’ placed snugly against the period, without any intervening space. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\newcommand{\VT}{Vermont}
Our college is in \VT .
The \VT{} summers are nice.
</pre> <p>But because of the gobbling, the second sentence needs the empty curly braces or else there would be no space separating ‘<samp>Vermont</samp>’ from ‘<samp>summers</samp>’. (Many authors instead use a backslash-space <code>\ </code> for this. See <a href="_005c_0028space_0029.html">Backslash-space, <code>\ </code></a>.) </p> <p>The <code>xspace</code> package provides <code>\xspace</code>. It is for writing commands which are designed to be used mainly in text. It must be place at the very end of the definition of these commands. It inserts a space after that command unless what immediately follows is in a list of exceptions. In this example, the empty braces are not needed. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\newcommand{\VT}{Vermont\xspace}
Our college is in \VT .
\VT summers are nice.
</pre> <p>The default exception list contains the characters <code>,.'/?;:!~-)</code>, the open curly brace and the backslash-space command discussed above, and the commands <code>\footnote</code> or <code>\footnotemark</code>. Add to that list as with <code>\xspaceaddexceptions{\myfni \myfnii}</code> which adds <code>\myfni</code> and <code>\myfnii</code> to the list, and remove from that list as with <code>\xspaceremoveexception{!}</code>. </p> <p>A comment: many experts prefer not to use <code>\xspace</code>. Putting it in a definition means that the command will usually get the spacing right. But it isn’t easy to predict when to enter empty braces because <code>\xspace</code> will get it wrong, such as when it is followed by another command, and so <code>\xspace</code> can make editing material harder and more error-prone than instead always inserting the empty braces. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
