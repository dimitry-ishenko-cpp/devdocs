<div class="section" id="g_t_005csubsection">   <h3 class="section" id="g_t_005csubsection">\subsection</h3>   <p>Synopsis, one of: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\subsection{<var>title</var>}
\subsection*{<var>title</var>}
\subsection[<var>toc-title</var>]{<var>title</var>}
</pre> <p>Start a subsection. The standard LaTeX classes <code>article</code>, <code>book</code>, and <code>report</code> all have this command. </p> <p>This produces a subsection. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">We will show that there are more functions than Turing machines and that
therefore some functions have no associated machine.

\subsection{Cardinality} We will begin with two paradoxes that
dramatize the challenge to our intuition posed by comparing the sizes of
infinite sets.
</pre> <p>For the standard LaTeX classes <code>book</code> and <code>report</code> the default output is like ‘<samp>1.2.3 <var>title</var></samp>’ (for chapter 1, section 2, subsection 3), alone on its line and flush left, in boldface and a larger type (the type size is <code>\large</code>). The same holds in <code>article</code> except that there are no chapters in that class so it looks like ‘<samp>2.3 <var>title</var></samp>’. </p> <p>The <code>*</code> form shows <var>title</var>. But it does not show the subsection number, does not increment the <code>subsection</code> counter, and produces no table of contents entry. </p> <p>The optional argument <var>toc-title</var> will appear as the subsection title in the table of contents (see <a href="table-of-contents-etc_002e.html">Table of contents, list of figures, list of tables</a>). If it is not present then <var>title</var> will be there. This shows the full text in the title of the subsection: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\subsection[$\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ paper]{\textit{The Origin of
  Chemical Elements} by R.A.~Alpher, H.~Bethe, and G.~Gamow}
</pre> <p>but only ‘<samp>α,β,γ paper</samp>’ on the contents page. </p> <p>For determining which sectional units are numbered and which appear in the table of contents, the level number of a subsection is 2 (see <a href="sectioning.html#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth">Sectioning/secnumdepth</a> and see <a href="sectioning.html#Sectioning_002ftocdepth">Sectioning/tocdepth</a>). </p>   <p>The paragraph that follows the subsection title is not indented, as is a standard typographical practice. One way to get an indent is to use the package <code>indentfirst</code>. </p>   <p>There are a number of ways to change the behavior of the <code>\subsection</code> command. One is the <code>\@startsection</code> command (see <a href="_005c_0040startsection.html"><code>\@startsection</code>, typesetting sectional unit headings</a>). There are also many packages on CTAN that address this, including <code>titlesec</code>. See the documentation but the example below gives a sense of what they can do. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\usepackage{titlesec}   % in preamble
\titleformat{\subsection}[runin]
  {\normalfont\normalsize\bfseries}  % format of the title
  {\thesubsection}                   % label
  {0.6em}                            % space between label and title
  {}                                 % before-code hook
</pre> <p>That puts the subsection number and <var>title</var> in the first line of text. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
