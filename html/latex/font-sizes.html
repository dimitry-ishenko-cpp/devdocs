  The Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao.
\end{quotation}
</pre> <p>Here, the scope of the <code>\small</code> lasts until the end of the <code>quotation</code> environment. It would also end at the next type style command or the end of the current group, so you could enclose it in curly braces <code>{\small This text is typeset in the small font.}</code>. </p> <p>Trying to use these commands in math, as with <code>$\small mv^2/2$</code>, results in ‘<samp>LaTeX Font Warning: Command \small invalid in math mode</samp>’, and the font size doesn’t change. To work with a too-large formula, often the best option is to use the <code>displaymath</code> environment (see <a href="math-formulas.html">Math formulas</a>), or one of the environments from the <code>amsmath</code> package. For inline mathematics, such as in a table of formulas, an alternative is something like <code>{\small $mv^2/2$}</code>. (Sometimes <code>\scriptsize</code> and <code>\scriptstyle</code> are confused. Both change the font size, but the latter also changes a number of other aspects of how mathematics is typeset. See <a href="math-styles.html">Math styles</a>.) </p>  <p>An <em>environment form</em> of each of these commands is also defined; for instance, <code>\begin{tiny}...\end{tiny}</code>. However, in practice this form can easily lead to unwanted spaces at the beginning and/or end of the environment without careful consideration, so it’s generally less error-prone to stick to the declaration form. </p> <p>(Aside: Technically, due to the way LaTeX defines <code>\begin</code> and <code>\end</code>, nearly every command that does not take an argument technically has an environment form. But in almost all cases, it would only cause confusion to use it. The reason for mentioning the environment form of the font size declarations specifically is that this particular use is not rare.) </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
