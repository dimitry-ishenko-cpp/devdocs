<div class="section" id="Recovering-from-errors">   <h3 class="section" id="Recovering-from-errors">Recovering from errors</h3> <p>If LaTeX finds an error in your document then it gives you an error message and prompts you with a question mark, <code>?</code>. For instance, running LaTeX on this file </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\newcommand{\NP}{\ensuremath{\textbf{NP}}}

           {} problem is a million dollar one.
? 
</pre> <p>The simplest thing is to enter <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>RETURN</kbd> and fix the typo. You could instead enter <kbd>?</kbd> and <kbd>RETURN</kbd> to see other options. </p>    <p>There are two other error scenarios. The first is that you forgot to include the <code>\end{document}</code> or misspelled it. In this case LaTeX gives you a ‘<samp>*</samp>’ prompt. You can get back to the command line by typing <kbd>\stop</kbd> and <kbd>RETURN</kbd>; this command does its best to exit LaTeX immediately, whatever state it may be in. </p> <p>The last scenario is that you mistyped the filename. For instance, instead of <code>pdflatex test</code> you might type <code>pdflatex tste</code>. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">! I can't find file `tste'.
&lt;*&gt; tste
        
(Press Enter to retry, or Control-D to exit)
Please type another input file name:
</pre> <p>The simplest thing is to enter <kbd>CTRL d</kbd> (holding the Control and d keys down at the same time), and then retype the correct command line. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
