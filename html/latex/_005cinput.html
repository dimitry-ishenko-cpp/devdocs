</pre> <p>LaTeX processes the file as if its contents were inserted in the current file. For a more sophisticated inclusion mechanism see <a href="_005cinclude-_0026-_005cincludeonly.html"><code>\include</code> &amp; <code>\includeonly</code></a>. </p> <p>If <var>filename</var> does not end in ‘<samp>.tex</samp>’ then LaTeX first tries the filename with that extension; this is the usual case. If <var>filename</var> ends with ‘<samp>.tex</samp>’ then LaTeX looks for the filename as it is. </p> <p>For example, this </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\input{macros}
</pre> <p>will cause LaTeX to first look for <samp>macros.tex</samp>. If it finds that file then it processes its contents as thought they had been copy-pasted in. If there is no file of the name <samp>macros.tex</samp> then LaTeX tries the name <samp>macros</samp>, without an extension. (This may vary by distribution.) </p> <p>To make your document portable across distributions and platforms you should avoid spaces in the file names. The tradition is to instead use dashes or underscores. Nevertheless, for the name ‘<samp>amo amas amat</samp>’, this works under TeX Live on GNU/Linux: </p>   <pre data-language="latex">\input{"amo\space amas\space amat"}
</pre> <p>and this works under MiKTeX on Windows: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\input{{"amo amas amat"}}
