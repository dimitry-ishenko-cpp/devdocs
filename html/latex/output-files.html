<div class="section" id="Output-files">   <h3 class="section" id="Output-files">Output files</h3> <p>LaTeX produces a main output file and at least two auxiliary files. The main output file’s name ends in either <samp>.dvi</samp> or <samp>.pdf</samp>. </p> <dl compact> <dt id="index-_002edvi-file"><span><code>.dvi</code><a href="#index-_002edvi-file" class="copiable-anchor"> ¶</a></span></dt> <dd>
     <p>If LaTeX is invoked with the system command <code>latex</code> then it produces a DeVice Independent file, with extension <samp>.dvi</samp>. You can view this file with a command such as <code>xdvi</code>, or convert it to a PostScript <code>.ps</code> file with <code>dvips</code> or to a Portable Document Format <code>.pdf</code> file with <code>dvipdfmx</code>. The contents of the file can be dumped in human-readable form with <code>dvitype</code>. A vast array of other DVI utility programs are available (<a href="https://mirror.ctan.org/dviware">https://mirror.ctan.org/dviware</a>). </p> </dd> <dt id="index-_002epdf-file"><span><code>.pdf</code><a href="#index-_002epdf-file" class="copiable-anchor"> ¶</a></span></dt> <dd>
  <p>If LaTeX is invoked via the system command <code>pdflatex</code>, among other commands (see <a href="tex-engines.html">TeX engines</a>), then the main output is a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. Typically this is a self-contained file, with all fonts and images included. </p> </dd> </dl> <p>LaTeX always produces at least two additional files. </p> <dl compact> <dt id="index-transcript-file"><span><code>.log</code><a href="#index-transcript-file" class="copiable-anchor"> ¶</a></span></dt> <dd>
  <p>This transcript file contains summary information such as a list of loaded packages. It also includes diagnostic messages and perhaps additional information for any errors. </p> </dd> <dt id="index-auxiliary-file"><span><code>.aux</code><a href="#index-auxiliary-file" class="copiable-anchor"> ¶</a></span></dt> <dd>
    <p>Auxiliary information is used by LaTeX for things such as cross references. For example, the first time that LaTeX finds a forward reference—a cross reference to something that has not yet appeared in the source—it will appear in the output as a doubled question mark <code>??</code>. When the referred-to spot does eventually appear in the source then LaTeX writes its location information to this <code>.aux</code> file. On the next invocation, LaTeX reads the location information from this file and uses it to resolve the reference, replacing the double question mark with the remembered location. </p> </dd> </dl>        <p>LaTeX may produce yet more files, characterized by the filename ending. These include a <code>.lof</code> file that is used to make a list of figures, a <code>.lot</code> file used to make a list of tables, and a <code>.toc</code> file used to make a table of contents (see <a href="table-of-contents-etc_002e.html">Table of contents, list of figures, list of tables</a>). A particular class may create others; the list is open-ended. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
