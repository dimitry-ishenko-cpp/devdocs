<div class="subsection" id="Colored-text">   <h4 class="subsection" id="Colored-text">Colored text</h4>   <p>Synopses: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\textcolor{<var>name</var>}{...}
\textcolor[<var>color model</var>]{<var>color specification</var>}{...}
</pre> <p>or </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\color{<var>name</var>}
\color[<var>color model</var>]{<var>specification</var>}
</pre> <p>The affected text gets the color. This line </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\textcolor{magenta}{My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:}
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!
</pre> <p>causes the first half to be in magenta while the rest is in black. You can use a color declared with <code>\definecolor</code> in exactly the same way that we just used the builtin color ‘<samp>magenta</samp>’. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\definecolor{MidlifeCrisisRed}{rgb}{1.0,0.11,0.0}
I'm thinking about getting a \textcolor{MidlifeCrisisRed}{sports car}.
</pre> <p>The two <code>\textcolor</code> and <code>\color</code> differ in that the first is a command form, enclosing the text to be colored as an argument. Often this form is more convenient, or at least more explicit. The second form is a declaration, as in <code>The moon is made of {\color{green}
green} cheese</code>, so it is in effect until the end of the current group or environment. This is sometimes useful when writing macros or as below where it colors everything inside the <code>center</code> environment, including the vertical and horizontal lines. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{center} \color{blue}
  \begin{tabular}{l|r}
    UL &amp;UR \\ \hline
    LL &amp;LR 
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
</pre> <p>You can use color in equations. A document might have this definition in the preamble </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\definecolor{highlightcolor}{RGB}{225,15,0}
</pre> <p>and then contain this equation. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{equation}
  \int_a^b \textcolor{highlightcolor}{f'(x)}\,dx=f(b)-f(a)
\end{equation}
</pre> <p>Typically the colors used in a document are declared in a class or style but sometimes you want a one-off. Those are the second forms in the synopses. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">Colors of \textcolor[rgb]{0.33,0.14,0.47}{Purple} and
{\color[rgb]{0.72,0.60,0.37}Gold} for the team.
</pre> <p>The format of <var>color specification</var> depends on the color model (see <a href="color-models.html">Color models</a>). For instance, while <code>rgb</code> takes three numbers, <code>gray</code> takes only one. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">The selection was \textcolor[gray]{0.5}{grayed out}.
</pre> <p>Colors inside colors do not combine. Thus </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\textcolor{green}{kind of \textcolor{blue}{blue}}
</pre> <p>has a final word that is blue, not a combination of blue and green. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
