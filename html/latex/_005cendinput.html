<div class="section" id="g_t_005cendinput">   <h3 class="section" id="g_t_005cendinput">\endinput</h3>  <p>Synopsis: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\endinput
</pre> <p>When you <code>\include{filename}</code>, inside <samp>filename.tex</samp> the material after <code>\endinput</code> will not be included. This command is optional; if <samp>filename.tex</samp> has no <code>\endinput</code> then LaTeX will read all of the file. </p> <p>For example, suppose that a document’s root file has <code>\input{chap1}</code> and this is <samp>chap1.tex</samp>. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\chapter{One}
This material will appear in the document. 
\endinput
This will not appear.
</pre> <p>This can be useful for putting documentation or comments at the end of a file, or for avoiding junk characters that can be added if the file is transmitted in the body of an email. It is also useful for debugging: one strategy to localize errors is to put <code>\endinput</code> halfway through the included file and see if the error disappears. Now, knowing which half contains the error, moving <code>\endinput</code> to halfway through that area further narrows down the location. This process rapidly finds the offending line. </p> <p>After reading <code>\endinput</code>, LaTeX continues to read to the end of the line, so something can follow this command and be read nonetheless. This allows you, for instance, to close an <code>\if...</code> with a <code>\fi</code>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
