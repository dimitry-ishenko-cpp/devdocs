<div class="section" id="Jobname">   <h3 class="section" id="Jobname">Jobname</h3>       <p>Running LaTeX creates a number of files, including the main PDF (or DVI) output but also including others. These files are named with the so-called <em>jobname</em>. The most common case is also the simplest, where for instance the command <code>pdflatex thesis</code> creates <code>thesis.pdf</code> and also <code>thesis.log</code> and <code>thesis.aux</code>. Here the job name is <code>thesis</code>. </p> <p>In general, LaTeX is invoked as <code><var>latex-engine</var>
<var>options</var> <var>argument</var></code>, where <var>latex-engine</var> is <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>lualatex</code>, etc. (see <a href="tex-engines.html">TeX engines</a>). If <var>argument</var> does not start with a backslash, as is the case above with <code>thesis</code>, then TeX considers it to be the name of the file to input as the main document. This file is referred to as the <em>root file</em> (see <a href="splitting-the-input.html">Splitting the input</a>, and <a href="_005cinput.html"><code>\input</code></a>). The name of that root file, without the <samp>.tex</samp> extension if any, is the jobname. If <var>argument</var> does start with a backslash, or if TeX is in interactive mode, then it waits for the first <code>\input</code> command, and the jobname is the argument to <code>\input</code>. </p> <p>There are two more possibilities for the jobname. It can be directly specified with the <code>-jobname</code> option, as in <code>pdflatex
-jobname=myname</code> (see <a href="command-line-input.html">Command line input</a> for a real example). </p>   <p>The final possibility is <samp>texput</samp>, which is the final fallback default if no other name is available to TeX. That is, if no <code>-jobname</code> option was specified, and the compilation stops before any input file is met, then the log file will be named <samp>texput.log</samp>. </p>   <p>A special case of this is that in LaTeX versions of (approximately) 2020 or later, the jobname is also <samp>texput</samp> if the first <code>\input</code> occurs as a result of being called by either <code>\documentclass</code> or <code>\RequirePackage</code>. So this will produce a file named <samp>texput.pdf</samp>: </p>  <pre data-language="latex">pdflatex "\documentclass{minimal}\begin{document}Hello!\end{document}"
</pre> <p>However, this special case only applies to those two commands. Thus, with </p>  <pre data-language="latex">pdflatex "\documentclass{article}\usepackage{lipsum}\input{thesis}"
</pre> <p>the output file is <samp>lipsum.pdf</samp>, as <code>\usepackage</code> calls <code>\input</code>. </p>  <p>Within the document, the macro <code>\jobname</code> expands to the jobname. (When you run LaTeX on a file whose name contains spaces, the string returned by <code>\jobname</code> contains matching start and end quotes.) In the expansion of that macro, all characters are of catcode 12 (other) except that spaces are category 10, including letters that are normally catcode 11. </p>    <p>Because of this catcode situation, using the jobname in a conditional can become complicated. One solution is to use the macro <code>\IfBeginWith</code> from the <samp>xstring</samp> package in its star variant, which is insensitive to catcode. For example, in the following text the footnote “Including Respublica Bananensis Francorum.” is only present if the task name starts with <samp>my-doc</samp>. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">If a democracy is just a regime where citizens vote then
all banana republics \IfBeginWith*{\jobname}{my-doc}%
{\footnote{Including Respublica Bananensis Francorum.}}{} are
democracies.
</pre> <p>Manipulating the value of <code>\jobname</code> inside of a document does not change the name of the output file or the log file. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
