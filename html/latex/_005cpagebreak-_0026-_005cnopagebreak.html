\nopagebreak[<var>zero-to-four</var>]
</pre> <p>Encourage or discourage a page break. The optional <var>zero-to-four</var> is an integer that allows you to soften the request. The default is 4, so that without the optional argument these commands entirely force or prevent the break. But for instance <code>\nopagebreak[1]</code> suggests to LaTeX that another spot might be preferable. The higher the number, the more insistent the request. Both commands are fragile (see <a href="_005cprotect.html"><code>\protect</code></a>). </p> <p>LaTeX’s page endings are optimized so ordinarily you only use this command in a document body to polish the final version, or inside commands. </p> <p>If you use these inside a paragraph, they apply to the point following the line in which they appear. So this </p>  <pre data-language="latex">Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent,
\pagebreak
a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.
</pre> <p>does not give a page break at ‘<samp>continent</samp>’, but instead at ‘<samp>nation</samp>’, since that is where LaTeX breaks that line. In addition, with <code>\pagebreak</code> the vertical space on the page is stretched out where possible so that it extends to the normal bottom margin. This can look strange, and if <code>\flushbottom</code> is in effect this can cause you to get ‘<samp>Underfull \vbox (badness 10000) has occurred while \output is active</samp>’. See <a href="_005cnewpage.html"><code>\newpage</code></a>, for a command that does not have these effects. </p>   <p>(There is an obsolete declaration <code>\samepage</code>, which tries to only allow a break between two paragraphs. There is a related environment <code>samepage</code>, also obsolete. Neither of these work reliably.
