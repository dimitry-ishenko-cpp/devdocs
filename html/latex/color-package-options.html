<div class="section" id="Color-package-options">   <h3 class="section" id="color-package-options">color package options</h3>   <p>Synopsis (must be in the document preamble): </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\usepackage[<var>comma-separated option list</var>]{color}
</pre> <p>When you load the <samp>color</samp> package there are two kinds of available options. </p> <p>The first specifies the <em>printer driver</em>. LaTeX doesn’t contain information about different output systems but instead depends on information stored in a file. Normally you should not specify the driver option in the document, and instead rely on your system’s default. One advantage of this is that it makes the document portable across systems. For completeness we include a list of the drivers. The currently relevant ones are: <samp>dvipdfmx</samp>, <samp>dvips</samp>, <samp>dvisvgm</samp>, <samp>luatex</samp>, <samp>pdftex</samp>, <samp>xetex</samp>. The two <samp>xdvi</samp> and <samp>oztex</samp> are essentially aliases for <samp>dvips</samp> (and <samp>xdvi</samp> is monochrome). Ones that should not be used for new systems are: <samp>dvipdf</samp>, <samp>dvipdfm</samp>, <samp>dviwin</samp>, <samp>dvipsone</samp>, <samp>emtex</samp>, <samp>pctexps</samp>, <samp>pctexwin</samp>, <samp>pctexhp</samp>, <samp>pctex32</samp>, <samp>truetex</samp>, <samp>tcidvi</samp>, <samp>vtex</samp> (and <samp>dviwindo</samp> is an alias for <samp>dvipsone</samp>). </p> <p>The second kind of options, beyond the drivers, are below. </p> <dl compact> <dt><span><code>monochrome</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Disable the color commands, so that they do not generate errors but do not generate color either. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>dvipsnames</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Make available a list of 68 color names that are often used, particularly in legacy documents. These color names were originally provided by the <samp>dvips</samp> driver, giving the option name. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>nodvipsnames</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Do not load that list of color names, saving LaTeX a tiny amount of memory space. </p> </dd> </dl> </div><div class="_attribution">
