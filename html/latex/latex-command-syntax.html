<div class="section" id="LaTeX-command-syntax">   <h3 class="section" id="LaTeX-command-syntax">LaTeX command syntax</h3>     <p>In the LaTeX input file, a command name starts with a backslash character, <code>\</code>. The name itself then consists of either (a) a string of letters or (b) a single non-letter. </p> <p>LaTeX commands names are case sensitive so that <code>\pagebreak</code> differs from <code>\Pagebreak</code> (the latter is not a standard command). Most command names are lowercase, but in any event you must enter all commands in the same case as they are defined. </p> <p>A command may be followed by zero, one, or more arguments. These arguments may be either required or optional. Required arguments are contained in curly braces, <code>{...}</code>. Optional arguments are contained in square brackets, <code>[...]</code>. Generally, but not universally, if the command accepts an optional argument, it comes first, before any required arguments. </p> <p>Inside of an optional argument, to use the character close square bracket (<code>]</code>) hide it inside curly braces, as in <code>\item[closing bracket {]}]</code>. Similarly, if an optional argument comes last, with no required argument after it, then to make the first character of the following text be an open square bracket, hide it inside curly braces. </p> <p>LaTeX has the convention that some commands have a <code>*</code> form that is related to the form without a <code>*</code>, such as <code>\chapter</code> and <code>\chapter*</code>. The exact difference in behavior varies from command to command. </p> <p>This manual describes all accepted options and <code>*</code>-forms for the commands it covers (barring unintentional omissions, a.k.a. bugs). </p>      <p>As of the 2020-10-01 release of LaTeX, the <code>expl3</code> and <code>xparse</code> packages are part of the LaTeX2e format. They provide a completely different underlying programming language syntax. We won’t try to cover them in this document; see the related package documentation and other LaTeX manuals. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
