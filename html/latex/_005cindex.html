</pre> <p>Declare an entry in the index. This command is fragile (see <a href="_005cprotect.html"><code>\protect</code></a>). </p> <p>For example, as described in <a href="indexes.html">Indexes</a>, one way to get an index from what’s below is to compile the document with <code>pdflatex test</code>, then process the index entries with <code>makeindex test</code>, and then compile again with <code>pdflatex test</code>. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">% file test.tex

W~Ackermann (1896--1962).\index{Ackermann}
  ...
Ackermann function\index{Ackermann!function}
  ...
rate of growth\index{Ackermann!function!growth rate}
</pre>  <p>All three index entries will get a page number, such as ‘<samp>Ackermann, 22</samp>’. LaTeX will format the second as a subitem of the first, on the line below it and indented, and the third as a subitem of the second. Three levels deep is as far as you can nest subentries. (If you add <code>\index{Ackermann!function!growth rate!comparison}</code> then <code>makeindex</code> says ‘<samp>Scanning input file test.idx....done (4 entries accepted, 1 rejected)</samp>’ and the fourth level is silently missing from the index.) </p> <p>If you enter a second <code>\index</code> with the same <var>index-entry-string</var> then you will get a single index entry with two page numbers (unless they happen to fall on the same page). Thus, adding <code>as for Ackermann.\index{Ackermann}</code> later in the same document as above will give an index entry like ‘<samp>Ackermann, 22, 151</samp>’. Also, you can enter the index entries in any order, so for instance <code>\index{Ackermann!function}</code> could come before <code>\index{Ackermann}</code>. </p>  <p>Get a page range in the output, like ‘<samp>Hilbert, 23--27</samp>’, as here. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">W~Ackermann (1896--1962).\index{Ackermann}

</pre> <p>If the beginning and ending of the page range are equal then the system just gives a single page number, not a range. </p> <p>If you index subentries but not a main entry, as with <code>\index{Jones!program}</code> and <code>\index{Jones!results}</code>, then the output is the item ‘<samp>Jones</samp>’ with no comma or page number, followed by two subitems, like ‘<samp>program, 50</samp>’ and ‘<samp>results, 51</samp>’. </p>         <p>Generate a index entry that says ‘<samp>see</samp>’ by using a vertical bar character: <code>\index{Ackermann!function|see{P\'eter's
function}}</code>. You can instead get ‘<samp>see also</samp>’ with <code>seealso</code>. (The text ‘<samp>see</samp>’ is defined by <code>\seename</code>, and ‘<samp>see also</samp>’ by <code>\alsoname</code>. You can redefine these either by using an internationalization package such as <code>babel</code> or <code>polyglossia</code>, or directly as with <code>\renewcommand{\alsoname}{Also see}</code>.) </p> <p>The ‘<samp>see</samp>’ feature is part of a more general functionality. After the vertical bar you can put the name of a one-input command, as in <code>\index{group|textit}</code> (note the missing backslash on the <code>\textit</code> command) and the system will apply that command to the page number, here giving something like <code>\textit{7}</code>. You can define your own one-input commands, such as <code>\newcommand{\definedpage}[1]{{\color{blue}#1}}</code> and then <code>\index{Ackermann!function|definedpage}</code> will give a blue page number (see <a href="color.html">Color</a>). Another, less practical, example is this, </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\newcommand\indexownpage[1]{#1, \thepage}
  ... Epimenides.\index{self-reference|indexownpage}
</pre> <p>which creates an entry citing the page number of its own index listing. </p> <p>The two functions just described combine, as here </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\index{Ackermann!function|(definedpage}
  ...
\index{Ackermann!function|)}
</pre> <p>which outputs an index entry like ‘<samp>function, 23--27</samp>’ where the page number range is in blue. </p> <p>Consider an index entry such as ‘<samp>α-ring</samp>’. Entering it as <code>$\alpha$-ring</code> will cause it to be alphabetized according to the dollar sign. You can instead enter it using an at-sign, as <code>\index{alpha-ring@$\alpha$-ring}</code>. If you specify an entry with an at-sign separating two strings, <code><var>pos</var>@<var>text</var></code>, then <var>pos</var> gives the alphabetical position of the entry while <var>text</var> produces the text of the entry. Another example is that <code>\index{Saint Michael's College@SMC}</code> produces an index entry ‘<samp>SMC</samp>’ alphabetized into a different location than its spelling would naturally give it. </p> <p>To put a <code>!</code>, or <code>@</code>, or <code>|</code>, or <code>"</code> character in an index entry, escape it by preceding it with a double quote, <code>"</code>. (The double quote gets deleted before alphabetization.) </p>   <p>A number of packages on CTAN have additional functionality beyond that provided by <code>makeidx</code>. One is <code>index</code>, which allows for multiple indices and contains a command <code>\index*{<var>index-entry-string</var>}</code> that prints the <var>index-entry-string</var> as well as indexing it. </p>   <p>The <code>\index</code> command writes the indexing information to the file <samp><var>root-name</var>.idx</samp> file. Specifically, it writes text of the command <code>\indexentry{<var>index-entry-string</var>}{<var>page-num</var>}</code>, where <var>page-num</var> is the value of the <code>\thepage</code> counter. On occasion, when the <code>\printindex</code> command is confused, you have to delete this file to start with a fresh slate. </p> <p>If you omit the closing brace of an <code>\index</code> command then you get a message like this. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">Runaway argument?  {Ackermann!function
