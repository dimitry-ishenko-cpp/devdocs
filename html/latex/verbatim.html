<var>literal-text</var>
\end{verbatim}
</pre> <p>A paragraph-making environment in which LaTeX produces as output exactly what you type as input. For instance inside <var>literal-text</var> the backslash <code>\</code> character does not start commands, it produces a printed ‘<samp>\</samp>’, and carriage returns and blanks are taken literally. The output appears in a monospaced typewriter-like font (<code>\tt</code>). </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{verbatim}
Symbol swearing: %&amp;$#?!.
\end{verbatim}
</pre> <p>The only restriction on <code>literal-text</code> is that it cannot include the string <code>\end{verbatim}</code>. </p>   <p>You cannot use the verbatim environment in the argument to macros, for instance in the argument to a <code>\section</code>. This is not the same as commands being fragile (see <a href="_005cprotect.html"><code>\protect</code></a>), instead it just cannot work, as the <code>verbatim</code> environment changes the catcode regime before processing its contents, and restore it immediately afterward, nevertheless with a macro argument the content of the argument has already be converted to a token list along the catcode regime in effect when the macro was called. However, the <code>cprotect</code> package can help with this. </p>     <p>One common use of verbatim input is to typeset computer code. There are packages that are an improvement the <code>verbatim</code> environment. For instance, one improvement is to allow the verbatim inclusion of external files, or parts of those files. Such packages include <code>listings</code>, and <code>minted</code>. </p>     <p>A package that provides many more options for verbatim environments is <code>fancyvrb</code>. Another is <code>verbatimbox</code>. </p> <p>For a list of all the relevant packages, see CTAN (see <a href="ctan.html">CTAN: The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network</a>). </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="_005cverb.html" accesskey="1"><code>\verb</code></a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
