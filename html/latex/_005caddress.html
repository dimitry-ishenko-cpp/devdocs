</pre> <p>Specify the return address, as it appears on the letter and on the envelope. Separate multiple lines in <var>senders address</var> with a double backslash, <code>\\</code>. </p> <p>Because it can apply to multiple letters this declaration is often put in the preamble. However, it can go anywhere, including inside an individual <code>letter</code> environment. </p> <p>This command is optional: if you do not use it then the letter is formatted with some blank space on top, for copying onto pre-printed letterhead paper. If you do use the <code>\address</code> declaration then it is formatted as a personal letter. </p> <p>Here is an example. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\address{Stephen Maturin \\
         The Grapes of the Savoy}
