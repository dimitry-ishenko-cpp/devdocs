When you insert <code>\-</code> commands in a word, the word will only be hyphenated at those points and not at any of the other hyphenation points that LaTeX might otherwise have chosen. This command is robust (see <a href="_005cprotect.html"><code>\protect</code></a>). </p> <p>LaTeX is good at hyphenating and usually finds most of the correct hyphenation points, while almost never using an incorrect one. The <code>\-</code> command is for exceptional cases. </p> <p>For example, LaTeX does not ordinarily hyphenate words containing a hyphen. Below, the long and hyphenated word means LaTeX has to put in unacceptably large spaces to set the narrow column. </p>  <pre data-language="latex">\begin{tabular}{rp{1.75in}}
  Isaac Asimov &amp;The strain of
               anti-intellectualism
               % an\-ti-in\-tel\-lec\-tu\-al\-ism
               has been a constant thread winding its way through our
               political and cultural life, nurtured by
               the false notion that democracy means that
               `my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge'.

</pre> <p>Commenting out the third line and uncommenting the fourth makes a much better fit. </p> <p>The <code>\-</code> command only allows LaTeX to break there, it does not require that it break there. You can force a split with something like <code>Hef-\linebreak feron</code>. Of course, if you later change the text then this forced break may look very odd, so this approach requires care. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
