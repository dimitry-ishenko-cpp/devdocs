Omit SetIdentifier for any other types of record sets.</p> </dd> <dt>Weight</dt>
<dd>
<p>Valid for Weighted resource record sets only. Among resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Amazon Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type. Amazon Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the total.</p> <p>Note the following:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li><p>You must specify a value for the Weight element for every weighted resource record set.</p></li> <li><p>You can only specify one ResourceRecord per weighted resource record set.</p></li> <li><p>You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements as weighted resource record sets.</p></li> <li><p>You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements.</p></li> <li>
<p>For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set Weight to 0 for a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set Weight to 0 for all resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability. The effect of setting Weight to 0 is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets. For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html">Options for Configuring Amazon Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive Failover</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.</p> </li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Region</dt>
<dd>
<p>Valid for Latency-based resource record sets only. The Amazon EC2 Region where the resource that is specified in this resource record set resides. The resource typically is an AWS resource, such as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address or a DNS domain name, depending on the record type.</p> </dd> <dt>GeoLocation</dt>
<dd>
<p>Geo location resource record sets only. A dict that lets you control how Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111, create a resource record set with a Type of A and a ContinentCode of AF.</p> <pre class="highlight-text notranslate" data-language="text">ContinentCode
    The two-letter code for the continent.
    Valid values: AF | AN | AS | EU | OC | NA | SA
    Constraint: Specifying ContinentCode with either CountryCode or SubdivisionCode
                returns an InvalidInput error.
CountryCode
    The two-letter code for the country.
SubdivisionCode
    The code for the subdivision, for example, a state in the United States or a
    province in Canada.</pre> <p>Notes</p> <ul class="simple"> <li><p>Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not supported.</p></li> <li><p>If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.</p></li> <li><p>You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location.</p></li> <li><p>The value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> in the CountryCode element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements.</p></li> <li><p>Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Amazon Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code>, which handles both queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> resource record set, Amazon Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations.</p></li> <li><p>You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements as geolocation resource record sets.</p></li> </ul> </dd> <dt>TTL</dt>
<dd>
<p>The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the following:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li><p>If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit TTL. Amazon Route 53 uses the value of TTL for the alias target.</p></li> <li><p>If you're associating this resource record set with a health check (if you're adding a HealthCheckId element), we recommend that you specify a TTL of 60 seconds or less so clients respond quickly to changes in health status.</p></li> <li><p>All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets must have the same value for TTL.</p></li> <li><p>If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more weighted alias resource record sets for which the alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you specify a TTL of 60 seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets that have the same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for load balancers) will change the effect of the values that you specify for Weight.</p></li> </ul> </dd> <dt>ResourceRecords</dt>
<dd>
<p>A list, containing one or more values for the resource record. No single value can exceed 4,000 characters. For details on how to format values for different record types, see <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html">Supported DNS Resource Record Types</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.</p> <p>Note: You can specify more than one value for all record types except CNAME and SOA.</p> <p>It is also possible to pass "magic" strings as resource record values. This functionality can easily be extended, but for the moment supports the following:</p> <blockquote> <div>
<p>'magic:ec2_instance_tag:some_tag_name:some_string:some_instance_attr'</p> </div>
</blockquote> <p>This tells salt to lookup an EC2 instance with a tag 'some_tag_name' which has the value 'some_string' and substitute the 'some_instance_attr' attribute of that instance as the resource record value being evaluated.</p> <p>This should work generally for any EC2 instance tags, as long as the instance attribute being fetched is available to getattr(instance, 'attribute') as seen in the code below. Anything else will most likely require this function to be extended to handle it.</p> <p>The canonical use-case for this (at least at our site) is to query the Name tag (which we always populate with the host's FQDN) to lookup the public or private IPs bound to the instance, so we can then automgically create Route 53 records for them.</p> </dd> <dt>AliasTarget</dt>
<dd>
<p>The rules governing how to define an AliasTarget for the various supported use-cases are obtuse beyond reason and attempting to paraphrase them (or even worse, cut-and-paste them in their entirety) would be silly and counterproductive.
