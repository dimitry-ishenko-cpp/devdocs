<h1 id="creating-a-scene" class=" section-header"><span class="descname">Creating-a-scene</span></h1> <p>The goal of this section is to give a brief introduction to three.js. We will start by setting up a scene, with a spinning cube. A working example is provided at the bottom of the page in case you get stuck and need help.</p> <div class="section">

<p> If you haven't yet, go through the <a class="reference internal" href="#manual/introduction/installation">Installation</a> guide. We'll assume you've already set up the same project structure (including <i>index.html</i> and <i>main.js</i>), have installed three.js, and are either running a build tool, or using a local server with a CDN and import maps. </p> </div> <div class="section">
<h2 class="section-title section-header" id="creating-the-scene">Creating the scene</h2>
<p>To actually be able to display anything with three.js, we need three things: scene, camera and renderer, so that we can render the scene with camera.</p> <p><i>main.js —</i></p> <pre data-language="javascript"><code>
		import * as THREE from 'three';

		const scene = new THREE.Scene();
		const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );

		const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
		renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
		document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );
		</code></pre> <p>Let's take a moment to explain what's going on here. We have now set up the scene, our camera and the renderer.</p> <p>There are a few different cameras in three.js. For now, let's use a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PerspectiveCamera</span></code>.</p> <p>The first attribute is the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">field of view</span></code>. FOV is the extent of the scene that is seen on the display at any given moment. The value is in degrees.</p> <p>The second one is the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">aspect ratio</span></code>. You almost always want to use the width of the element divided by the height, or you'll get the same result as when you play old movies on a widescreen TV - the image looks squished.</p> <p>The next two attributes are the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">near</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">far</span></code> clipping plane. What that means, is that objects further away from the camera than the value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">far</span></code> or closer than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">near</span></code> won't be rendered. You don't have to worry about this now, but you may want to use other values in your apps to get better performance.</p> <p>Next up is the renderer. In addition to creating the renderer instance, we also need to set the size at which we want it to render our app. It's a good idea to use the width and height of the area we want to fill with our app - in this case, the width and height of the browser window. For performance intensive apps, you can also give <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setSize</span></code> smaller values, like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">window.innerWidth/2</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">window.innerHeight/2</span></code>, which will make the app render at quarter size.</p> <p>If you wish to keep the size of your app but render it at a lower resolution, you can do so by calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setSize</span></code> with false as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">updateStyle</span></code> (the third argument). For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setSize(window.innerWidth/2, window.innerHeight/2, false)</span></code> will render your app at half resolution, given that your &lt;canvas&gt; has 100% width and height.</p> <p>Last but not least, we add the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">renderer</span></code> element to our HTML document. This is a &lt;canvas&gt; element the renderer uses to display the scene to us.</p> <p><em>"That's all good, but where's that cube you promised?"</em> Let's add it now.</p> <pre data-language="javascript"><code>
		const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );
		const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00 } );
		const cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
		scene.add( cube );

		camera.position.z = 5;
		</code></pre> <p>To create a cube, we need a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BoxGeometry</span></code>. This is an object that contains all the points (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vertices</span></code>) and fill (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">faces</span></code>) of the cube. We'll explore this more in the future.</p> <p>In addition to the geometry, we need a material to color it. Three.js comes with several materials, but we'll stick to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MeshBasicMaterial</span></code> for now. All materials take an object of properties which will be applied to them. To keep things very simple, we only supply a color attribute of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0x00ff00</span></code>, which is green. This works the same way that colors work in CSS or Photoshop (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hex colors</span></code>).</p> <p>The third thing we need is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mesh</span></code>. A mesh is an object that takes a geometry, and applies a material to it, which we then can insert to our scene, and move freely around.</p> <p>By default, when we call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scene.add()</span></code>, the thing we add will be added to the coordinates <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(0,0,0)</span></code>. This would cause both the camera and the cube to be inside each other. To avoid this, we simply move the camera out a bit.</p> </div> <div class="section">
<h2 class="section-title section-header" id="rendering-the-scene">Rendering the scene</h2>
<p>If you copied the code from above into the main.js file we created earlier, you wouldn't be able to see anything. This is because we're not actually rendering anything yet. For that, we need what's called a render or animation loop.</p> <pre data-language="javascript"><code>
		function animate() {
			renderer.render( scene, camera );
		}
		renderer.setAnimationLoop( animate );
		</code></pre> <p>This will create a loop that causes the renderer to draw the scene every time the screen is refreshed (on a typical screen this means 60 times per second). If you're new to writing games in the browser, you might say <em>"why don't we just create a setInterval ?"</em> The thing is - we could, but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requestAnimationFrame</span></code> which is internally used in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WebGLRenderer</span></code> has a number of advantages. Perhaps the most important one is that it pauses when the user navigates to another browser tab, hence not wasting their precious processing power and battery life.</p> </div> <div class="section">
<h2 class="section-title section-header" id="animating-the-cube">Animating the cube</h2>
<p>If you insert all the code above into the file you created before we began, you should see a green box. Let's make it all a little more interesting by rotating it.</p> <p>Add the following code right above the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">renderer.render</span></code> call in your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">animate</span></code> function:</p> <pre data-language="javascript"><code>
		cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
		cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
		</code></pre> <p>This will be run every frame (normally 60 times per second), and give the cube a nice rotation animation. Basically, anything you want to move or change while the app is running has to go through the animation loop. You can of course call other functions from there, so that you don't end up with an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">animate</span></code> function that's hundreds of lines.</p> </div> <div class="section">
