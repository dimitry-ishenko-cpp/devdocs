<strong>Write acknowledgements</strong> are set per table with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_acks</code> setting, either using the <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/config/">config</a> command or by writing to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table_config</code> <a href="../system-tables/index.html">system table</a>. The default is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">majority</code>, meaning writes will be acknowledged when a majority of (voting) replicas have confirmed their writes. The other possible option is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single</code>, meaning writes will be acknowledged when a single replica acknowledges it.</li> <li>
<strong>Durability</strong> is set per table with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">durability</code> setting, again using either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reconfigure</code> or writing to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table_config</code> system table. In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hard</code> durability mode, writes are committed to disk before acknowledgements are sent; in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">soft</code> mode, writes are acknowledged immediately after being stored in memory. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">soft</code> mode is faster but slightly less resilient to failure. The default is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hard</code>.</li> <li>
<strong>Read mode</strong> is set per query via an optional argument, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read_mode</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readMode</code>), to <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/table/">table</a>. It has three possible values: <ul> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single</code> returns values that are in memory (but not necessarily written to disk) on the primary replica. This is the default.</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">majority</code> will only return values that are safely committed on disk on a majority of replicas. This requires sending a message to every replica on each read, so it is the slowest but most consistent.</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outdated</code> will return values that are in memory on an arbitrarily-selected replica. This is the fastest but least consistent.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Note that <a href="../changefeeds/ruby/index.html">changefeeds</a> will ignore the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read_mode</code> flag, and will always behave as if it is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single</code>.</p> <h2 id="linearizability-and-atomicity-guarantees">Linearizability and atomicity guarantees</h2> <p>With the following settings, RethinkDB guarantees linearizability of individual atomic operations on individual documents:</p> <ul> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_acks</code>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">majority</code>
</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">durability</code>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hard</code>
</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read_mode</code>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">majority</code>
</li> </ul> <p>This means that every read will see every previous successful write, and no read will ever see a definitively failed write. (See note about definitively failed vs. indeterminate writes below.)</p> <p>The linearizability guarantee is for <em>atomic operations,</em> not for <em>queries.</em> A single RethinkDB query will not necessarily execute as a single atomic operation. It’s possible that the query:</p> <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">r.table("foo").get("bar").eq(r.table("foo").get("bar")).run(conn, callback);
</pre></div></div> <p>could return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>! Each individual <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/get/">get</a> operation is atomic, but the query as a whole is not. To read and modify a document in a single atomic operation, use the <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/update/">update</a> or <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/replace/">replace</a> commands.</p> <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">r.table("foo").get(id).update({hits: r.row("hits") + 1}).run(conn, callback);
</pre></div></div> <p>This can also be used to implement a check-and-set register. The following query will atomically check whether the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check</code> field is equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">old_value</code> and change it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new_value</code> if so:</p> <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">r.table("foo").get(register_id).update({
    check: r.branch(r.row("check").eq(old_value), new_value, r.row("check"))
}).run(conn, callback);
</pre></div></div> <blockquote class="infobox ">
<p>RethinkDB operations are never atomic across multiple keys. For this reason, RethinkDB cannot be considered an ACID database.</p> </blockquote> <p>Currently, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_all</code> and similar operations execute as separate operations from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> and other mutation operations. Therefore, the following is <em>not</em> a correct implementation of a check-and-set register, since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> will not execute in one atomic operation:</p> <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">r.table("foo").filter({
    id: register_id, foo: old_val
}).update({foo: new_val}).run(conn, callback);

table.filter({id: register_id, foo: old_val}).update({foo: new_val})
</pre></div></div> <p>This behavior may change in the future. See <a href="https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3992" title="Make table.filter.update atomic">Github issue #3992</a> to track the discussion.</p> <h2 id="availability-guarantees">Availability guarantees</h2> <p>Except for brief periods, a table will remain fully available as long as more than half of the voting replicas for each shard and for the table overall are available. If half or more of the voting replicas for a shard are lost, then read or write operations on that shard will fail.</p> <p>Reconfiguring a table (changing the number of shards, rebalancing, etc.) causes brief losses of availability at various points during the reconfiguration.</p> <p>If the primary replica is lost but more than half of the voting replicas are still available, an arbitrary voting replica will be elected as primary. The new primary will appear in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table_status</code>, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">primary_replica</code> field of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table_config</code> will not change. If the old primary ever becomes available again, the system will switch back. When the primary changes there will be a brief period of unavailability.</p> <p>If half or more of the voting replicas of a shard are lost, the only way to recover availability is to run <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/reconfigure">reconfigure</a> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emergency_repair</code> option. Consult the documentation for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reconfigure</code> for more details.</p> <p>Reads run in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single</code> mode may succeed even if the table is not available, but this is not guaranteed. Reads run in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outdated</code> mode will succeed as long as at least one replica for each of the relevant shards is available.</p> <blockquote class="infobox ">
<p><strong>Voting and non-voting?</strong> All replicas are “voting” replicas by default, which simply means that they’re counted in any operation that requires a majority of replicas to be available. However, the speed at which replicas “vote” is affected by network latency; if you have a faraway data center with higher latency, you might want to set its replicas to be non-voting to improve performance, at the cost of guaranteed availability in that data center. You can set a replica to be “non-voting” by changing its table configuration with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reconfigure</code>.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="balancing-safety-and-performance">Balancing safety and performance</h2> <p>RethinkDB’s default settings prioritize safety over performance, except in one case: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read_mode</code> defaults to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single</code> rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">majority</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">majority</code> read mode requires sending a query to all of the replicas and waiting for a majority to reply, which significantly degrades performance.</p> <p>In normal operation, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single</code> read mode produces the same results as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">majority</code> read mode, but it might return outdated results in the event of a network failure or crash. It’s also possible that a read run in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single</code> mode could return results from an incomplete write that is later rolled back.</p> <p>The same is true for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single</code> write mode and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">soft</code> durability mode. In normal operation these produce the same results as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">majority</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hard</code>, but in the event of a network or server failure, recent write operations that were run using these modes might be lost.</p> <p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_acks</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">durability</code> don’t actually affect how the write is performed; they only affect when the acknowledgement is sent back to the client.</p> <p>Reads run in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"outdated"</code> mode will return outdated data even during normal operation, but the data will typically be less than a second out of date. In the event of a network or server failure, the data may be much more out of date. The advantage of running reads in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"outdated"</code> mode is that the latency and throughput are often better than in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"single"</code> mode, in addition to the availability differences described in the previous section.</p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <p>Using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emergency_repair</code> option on a table will invalidate all the guarantees.</p> <p>There are two ways a write operation can fail. If a write fails <strong>definitively,</strong> no read will ever see it, even in the weaker read modes. If it fails <strong>indeterminately,</strong> reads run in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outdated</code> modes might see it, but when the network failure or crash that caused the problem is resolved the write might or might not be rolled back. In general, writes will fail indeterminately if they were running at the exact moment when the network or server issue first happened. Both of these failures will generate errors, and you can examine the error message to see whether the failure was definitive or indeterminate.</p> <p>RethinkDB’s automatic failover has limitations in cases of non-transitive connectivity failure, i.e., server A can contact B and B can contact C, but A cannot contact C.
