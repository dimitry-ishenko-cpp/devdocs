<span class="caps">SCSS</span>
</h2> <p>The <span class="caps">SCSS</span> syntax uses the file extension <code>.scss</code>. With a few small exceptions, it’s a superset of <span class="caps">CSS</span>, which means essentially <strong>all valid <span class="caps">CSS</span> is valid <span class="caps">SCSS</span> as well</strong>. Because of its similarity to <span class="caps">CSS</span>, it’s the easiest syntax to get used to and the most popular.</p> <p><span class="caps">SCSS</span> looks like this:</p> <pre class="language-scss" data-language="scss">@mixin button-base() {
  @include typography(button);
  @include ripple-surface;
  @include ripple-radius-bounded;

  display: inline-flex;
  position: relative;
  height: $button-height;
  border: none;
  vertical-align: middle;

  &amp;:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
  }

  &amp;:disabled {
    color: $mdc-button-disabled-ink-color;
    cursor: default;
    pointer-events: none;
  }
}</pre> <h2 id="the-indented-syntax" tabindex="-1">The Indented Syntax
</h2> <p>The indented syntax was Sass’s original syntax, so it uses the file extension <code>.sass</code>. Because of this extension, it’s sometimes just called "Sass". The indented syntax supports all the same features as <span class="caps">SCSS</span>, but it uses indentation instead of curly braces and semicolons to describe the format of the document.</p> <p>In general, any time you’d write curly braces in <span class="caps">CSS</span> or <span class="caps">SCSS</span>, you can just indent one level deeper in the indented syntax. And any time a line ends, that counts as a semicolon. There are also a few additional differences in the indented syntax that are noted throughout the reference.</p> <div class="sl-c-callout sl-c-callout--warning">  <p>The indented syntax currently doesn’t support expressions that wrap across multiple lines. See <a href="https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/216">issue #216</a>.</p> </div> <p>The indented syntax looks like this:</p> <pre class="language-sass" data-language="sass">// SASS
