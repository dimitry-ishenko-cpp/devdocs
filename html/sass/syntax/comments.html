Both syntaxes support two types of comments: comments defined using <code>/* */</code> that are (usually) compiled to <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and comments defined using <code>//</code> that are not.</p> </div> <h2 id="in-scss" tabindex="-1">In <span class="caps">SCSS</span>
</h2> <p>Comments in <span class="caps">SCSS</span> work similarly to comments in other languages like JavaScript. <strong>Single-line comments</strong> start with <code>//</code>, and go until the end of the line. Nothing in a single-line comment is emitted as <span class="caps">CSS</span>; as far as Sass is concerned, they may as well not exist. They’re also called <strong>silent comments</strong>, because they don’t produce any <span class="caps">CSS</span>.</p> <p><strong>Multi-line comments</strong> start with <code>/*</code> and end at the next <code>*/</code>. If a multi-line comment is written somewhere that a <a href="structure.html#statements">statement</a> is allowed, it’s compiled to a <span class="caps">CSS</span> comment. They’re also called <strong>loud comment</strong>, by contrast with silent comments. A multi-line comment that’s compiled to <span class="caps">CSS</span> may contain <a href="../interpolation.html">interpolation</a>, which will be evaluated before the comment is compiled.</p> <p>By default, multi-line comments will be stripped from the compiled <span class="caps">CSS</span> in <a href="../cli/dart-sass.html#style">compressed mode</a>. If a comment begins with <code>/*!</code>, though, it will always be included in the <span class="caps">CSS</span> output.</p> <div class="code-example ui-tabs"> <div id="example-scss-comment-scss" class="ui-tabs-panel scss sl-c-code-panel"><pre class="language-scss" data-language="scss">// This comment won't be included in the CSS.

</h2> <p>Comments in the indented syntax work a little differently: they’re indentation-based, just like the rest of the syntax. Like <span class="caps">SCSS</span>, silent comments written with <code>//</code> are never emitted as <span class="caps">CSS</span>, but unlike <span class="caps">SCSS</span> everything indented beneath the opening <code>//</code> is also commented out.</p> <p>Indented syntax comments that start with <code>/*</code> work with indentation the same way, except that they are compiled to <span class="caps">CSS</span>. Because the extent of the comment is based on indentation, the closing <code>*/</code> is optional. Also like <span class="caps">SCSS</span>, <code>/*</code> comments can contain <a href="../interpolation.html">interpolation</a> and can start with <code>/*!</code> to avoid being stripped in compressed mode.</p> <p>Comments can also be used within <a href="structure.html#expressions">expressions</a> in the indented syntax. In this case, they have exactly the same syntax as they do in <span class="caps">SCSS</span>.</p> <div class="code-example ui-tabs"> <div id="example-sass-comment-sass" class="ui-tabs-panel sass sl-c-code-panel"><pre class="language-sass" data-language="sass">// SASS

</h2> <p>When writing style libraries using Sass, you can use comments to document the <a href="../at-rules/mixin.html">mixins</a>, <a href="../at-rules/function.html">functions</a>, <a href="../variables.html">variables</a>, and <a href="../style-rules/placeholder-selectors.html">placeholder selectors</a> that your library provides, as well as the library itself. These comments are read by the <a href="http://sassdoc.com">SassDoc</a> tool, which uses them to generate beautiful documentation. Check out <a href="http://oddbird.net/susy/docs/index.html">the Susy grid engine</a>’s documentation to see it in action!</p> <p>Documentation comments are silent comments, written with three slashes (<code>///</code>) directly above the thing you’re documenting. SassDoc parses text in the comments as <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started">Markdown</a>, and supports many useful <a href="http://sassdoc.com/annotations/">annotations</a> to describe it in detail.</p> <div class="code-example ui-tabs"> <div id="example-documentation-comment-scss" class="ui-tabs-panel scss sl-c-code-panel"><pre class="language-scss" data-language="scss">/// Computes an exponent.
