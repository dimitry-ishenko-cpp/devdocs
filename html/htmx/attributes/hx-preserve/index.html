<h1><code>hx-preserve</code></h1> <p>The <code>hx-preserve</code> attribute allows you to keep an element unchanged during HTML replacement. Elements with <code>hx-preserve</code> set are preserved by <code>id</code> when htmx updates any ancestor element. You <em>must</em> set an unchanging <code>id</code> on elements for <code>hx-preserve</code> to work. The response requires an element with the same <code>id</code>, but its type and other attributes are ignored.</p> <p>Note that some elements cannot unfortunately be preserved properly, such as <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> (focus and caret position are lost), iframes or certain types of videos. To tackle some of these cases we recommend the <a href="../../extensions/morphdom-swap/index.html">morphdom extension</a>, which does a more elaborate DOM reconciliation.</p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <ul> <li>
