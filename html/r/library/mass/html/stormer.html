<code>stormer</code>  The Stormer Viscometer Data </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The stormer viscometer measures the viscosity of a fluid by measuring the time taken for an inner cylinder in the mechanism to perform a fixed number of revolutions in response to an actuating weight. The viscometer is calibrated by measuring the time taken with varying weights while the mechanism is suspended in fluids of accurately known viscosity. The data comes from such a calibration, and theoretical considerations suggest a nonlinear relationship between time, weight and viscosity, of the form <code>Time = (B1*Viscosity)/(Weight - B2) + E</code> where <code>B1</code> and <code>B2</code> are unknown parameters to be estimated, and <code>E</code> is error. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">stormer
