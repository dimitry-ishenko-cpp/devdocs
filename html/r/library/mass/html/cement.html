</code></pre> <h3>Format</h3> <dl> <dt><code>x1, x2, x3, x4</code></dt>
<dd> <p>Proportions (%) of active ingredients. </p> </dd> <dt><code>y</code></dt>
<dd> <p>heat evolved in cals/gm. </p> </dd> </dl> <h3>Details</h3> <p>Thirteen samples of Portland cement were set. For each sample, the percentages of the four main chemical ingredients was accurately measured. While the cement was setting the amount of heat evolved was also measured. </p> <h3>Source</h3> <p>Woods, H., Steinour, H.H. and Starke, H.R.
