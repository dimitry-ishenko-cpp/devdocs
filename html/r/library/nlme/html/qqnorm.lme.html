<code>qqnorm.lme</code> Normal Plot of Residuals or Random Effects from an lme Object</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Diagnostic plots for assessing the normality of residuals and random effects in the linear mixed-effects fit are obtained. The <code>form</code> argument gives considerable flexibility in the type of plot specification. A conditioning expression (on the right side of a <code>|</code> operator) always implies that different panels are used for each level of the conditioning factor, according to a Trellis display. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'lme'
qqnorm(y, form, abline, id, idLabels, grid, ...)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="y">y</code></td> <td> <p>an object inheriting from class <code>"<a href="lme.html">lme</a>"</code>, representing a fitted linear mixed-effects model or from class <code>"<a href="lmlist.html">lmList</a>"</code>, representing a list of <code>lm</code> objects, or from class <code>"lm"</code>, representing a fitted linear model, or from class <code>"nls"</code>, representing a nonlinear least squares fitted model.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="form">form</code></td> <td> <p>an optional one-sided formula specifying the desired type of plot. Any variable present in the original data frame used to obtain <code>y</code> can be referenced. In addition, <code>y</code> itself can be referenced in the formula using the symbol <code>"."</code>. Conditional expressions on the right of a <code>|</code> operator can be used to define separate panels in a Trellis display. The expression on the right hand side of <code>form</code> and to the left of a <code>|</code> operator must evaluate to a residuals vector, or a random effects matrix. Default is <code>~ resid(., type = "p")</code>, corresponding to a normal plot of the standardized residuals evaluated at the innermost level of nesting.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="abline">abline</code></td> <td> <p>an optional numeric value, or numeric vector of length two. If given as a single value, a horizontal line will be added to the plot at that coordinate; else, if given as a vector, its values are used as the intercept and slope for a line added to the plot. If missing, no lines are added to the plot.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="id">id</code></td> <td> <p>an optional numeric value, or one-sided formula. If given as a value, it is used as a significance level for a two-sided outlier test for the standardized residuals (random effects). Observations with absolute standardized residuals (random effects) greater than the <code class="reqn">1 - value/2</code> quantile of the standard normal distribution are identified in the plot using <code>idLabels</code>. If given as a one-sided formula, its right hand side must evaluate to a logical, integer, or character vector which is used to identify observations in the plot. If missing, no observations are identified.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="idLabels">idLabels</code></td> <td> <p>an optional vector, or one-sided formula. If given as a vector, it is converted to character and used to label the observations identified according to <code>id</code>. If given as a one-sided formula, its right hand side must evaluate to a vector which is converted to character and used to label the identified observations. Default is the innermost grouping factor.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="grid">grid</code></td> <td> <p>an optional logical value indicating whether a grid should be added to plot. Default is <code>FALSE</code>.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="...">...</code></td> <td> <p>optional arguments passed to the Trellis plot function.</p> </td>
