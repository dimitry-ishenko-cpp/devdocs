<h2>
<code>Ovary</code> Counts of Ovarian Follicles</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The <code>Ovary</code> data frame has 308 rows and 3 columns. </p> <h3>Format</h3> <p>This data frame contains the following columns: </p> <dl> <dt>Mare</dt>
<dd> <p>an ordered factor indicating the mare on which the measurement is made. </p> </dd> <dt>Time</dt>
<dd> <p>time in the estrus cycle. The data were recorded daily from 3 days before ovulation until 3 days after the next ovulation. The measurement times for each mare are scaled so that the ovulations for each mare occur at times 0 and 1. </p> </dd> <dt>follicles</dt>
<dd> <p>the number of ovarian follicles greater than 10 mm in diameter. </p> </dd> </dl> <h3>Details</h3> <p>Pierson and Ginther (1987) report on a study of the number of large ovarian follicles detected in different mares at several times in their estrus cycles. </p> <h3>Source</h3> <p>Pinheiro, J.
