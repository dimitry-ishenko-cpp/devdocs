<code>showMethods</code> Show all the methods for the specified function(s) or class</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Show a summary of the methods for one or more generic functions, possibly restricted to those involving specified classes. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">showMethods(f = character(), where = topenv(parent.frame()),

</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="f">f</code></td> <td> <p>one or more function names. If omitted, all functions will be shown that match the other arguments. </p> <p>The argument can also be an expression that evaluates to a single generic function, in which case argument <code>fdef</code> is ignored. Providing an expression for the function allows examination of hidden or anonymous functions; see the example for <code>isDiagonal()</code>.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="where">where</code></td> <td> <p>Where to find the generic function, if not supplied as an argument. When <code>f</code> is missing, or length 0, this also determines which generic functions to examine. If <code>where</code> is supplied, only the generic functions returned by <code>getGenerics(where)</code> are eligible for printing. If <code>where</code> is also missing, all the cached generic functions are considered.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="classes">classes</code></td> <td> <p>If argument <code>classes</code> is supplied, it is a vector of class names that restricts the displayed results to those methods whose signatures include one or more of those classes.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="includeDefs">includeDefs</code></td> <td> <p>If <code>includeDefs</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, include the definitions of the individual methods in the printout.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="inherited">inherited</code></td> <td> <p>logical indicating if methods that have been found by inheritance, so far in the session, will be included and marked as inherited. Note that an inherited method will not usually appear until it has been used in this session. See <code><a href="getmethod.html">selectMethod</a></code> if you want to know what method would be dispatched for particular classes of arguments.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="showEmpty">showEmpty</code></td> <td> <p>logical indicating whether methods with no defined methods matching the other criteria should be shown at all. By default, <code>TRUE</code> if and only if argument <code>f</code> is not missing.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="printTo">printTo</code></td> <td> <p>The connection on which the information will be shown; by default, on standard output.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="fdef">fdef</code></td> <td> <p>Optionally, the generic function definition to use; if missing, one is found, looking in <code>where</code> if that is specified. See also comment in ‘Details’.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>
<code id="generic.function">generic.function</code>, <code id="class">class</code>
</td> <td> <p>See <code>methods</code>.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>See <code>methods</code> for a description of <code>.S4methods</code>. </p> <p>The name and package of the generic are followed by the list of signatures for which methods are currently defined, according to the criteria determined by the various arguments. Note that the package refers to the source of the generic function. Individual methods for that generic can come from other packages as well. </p> <p>When more than one generic function is involved, either as specified or because <code>f</code> was missing, the functions are found and <code>showMethods</code> is recalled for each, including the generic as the argument <code>fdef</code>. In complicated situations, this can avoid some anomalous results. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>If <code>printTo</code> is <code>FALSE</code>, the character vector that would have been printed is returned; otherwise the value is the connection or filename, via <code><a href="../../base/html/invisible.html">invisible</a></code>. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>Chambers, John M. (2008) <em>Software for Data Analysis: Programming with R</em> Springer. (For the R version.) </p> <p>Chambers, John M.
