<h2>
<code>LanguageClasses</code> Classes to Represent Unevaluated Language Objects</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p> The virtual class <code>"language"</code> and the specific classes that extend it represent unevaluated objects, as produced for example by the parser or by functions such as <code><a href="../../base/html/substitute.html">quote</a></code>. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
### each of these classes corresponds to an unevaluated object
### in the S language.
### The class name can appear in method signatures,
### and in a few other contexts (such as some calls to as()).

"("
"&lt;-"
"call"
"for"
"if"
"repeat"
"while"
"name"
"{"

### Each of the classes above extends the virtual class
"language"
</pre> <h3>Objects from the Class</h3> <p><code>"language"</code> is a virtual class; no objects may be created from it. </p> <p>Objects from the other classes can be generated by a call to <code>new(Class, ...)</code>, where <code>Class</code> is the quoted class name, and the ... arguments are either empty or a <em>single</em> object that is from this class (or an extension). </p> <h3>Methods</h3> <dl> <dt>coerce</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>signature(from = "ANY", to = "call")</code>. A method exists for <code>as(object, "call")</code>, calling <code>as.call()</code>. </p> </dd> </dl> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r">
showClass("language")

is( quote(sin(x)) ) # "call"  "language"

(ff &lt;- new("if"))  ; is(ff) # "if" "language"
(ff &lt;- new("for")) ; is(ff) # "for" "language"
