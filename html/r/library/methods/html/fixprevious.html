<code>fixPrevious</code> Fix Objects Saved from R Versions Previous to 1.8</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Beginning with R version 1.8.0, the class of an object contains the identification of the package in which the class is defined. The function <code>fixPre1.8</code> fixes and re-assigns objects missing that information (typically because they were loaded from a file saved with a previous version of R.) </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">fixPre1.8(names, where)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="names">names</code></td> <td> <p> Character vector of the names of all the objects to be fixed and re-assigned.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="where">where</code></td> <td> <p>The environment from which to look for the objects, and for class definitions. Defaults to the top environment of the call to <code>fixPre1.8</code>, the global environment if the function is used interactively.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The named object will be saved where it was found. Its class attribute will be changed to the full form required by R 1.8; otherwise, the contents of the object should be unchanged. </p> <p>Objects will be fixed and re-assigned only if all the following conditions hold: </p> <ol> <li>
<p> The named object exists. </p> </li> <li>
<p> It is from a defined class (not a basic datatype which has no actual class attribute). </p> </li> <li>
<p> The object appears to be from an earlier version of R. </p> </li> <li>
<p> The class is currently defined. </p> </li> <li>
<p> The object is consistent with the current class definition. </p> </li>
</ol> <p>If any condition except the second fails, a warning message is generated. </p> <p>Note that <code>fixPre1.8</code> currently fixes <em>only</em> the change in class attributes. In particular, it will not fix binary versions of packages installed with earlier versions of R if these use incompatible features. Such packages must be re-installed from source, which is the wise approach always when major version changes occur in R. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>The names of all the objects that were in fact re-assigned. </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
