<code>drawDetails</code>  Customising grid Drawing </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>These generic hook functions are called whenever a grid grob is drawn. They provide an opportunity for customising the drawing of a new class derived from grob (or gTree). </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">drawDetails(x, recording)
preDrawDetails(x)
postDrawDetails(x)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td> <td> <p> A grid grob. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="recording">recording</code></td> <td> <p> A logical value indicating whether a grob is being added to the display list or redrawn from the display list. </p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> these functions have been largely superceded by the <code><a href="makecontent.html">makeContent</a></code> and <code><a href="makecontent.html">makeContext</a></code> functions, though they are still run and may still be useful in some contexts. </p> <p>These functions are called by the <code>grid.draw</code> methods for grobs and gTrees. </p> <p><code>preDrawDetails</code> is called first during the drawing of a grob. This is where any additional viewports should be pushed. Note that the default behaviour for grobs is to push any viewports in the <code>vp</code> slot, and for gTrees is to also push and up any viewports in the <code>childrenvp</code> slot so there is typically nothing to do here. </p> <p><code>drawDetails</code> is called next and is where any additional calculations and graphical output should occur. Note that the default behaviour for gTrees is to draw all grobs in the <code>children</code> slot so there is typically nothing to do here. </p> <p><code>postDrawDetails</code> is called last and should reverse anything done in <code>preDrawDetails</code> (i.e., pop or up any viewports that were pushed). Note that the default behaviour for grobs is to pop any viewports that were pushed so there is typically nothing to do here. </p> <p>Note that <code>preDrawDetails</code> and <code>postDrawDetails</code> are also called in the calculation of <code>"grobwidth"</code> and <code>"grobheight"</code> units. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>None of these functions are expected to return a value. </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p> Paul Murrell </p> <h3>References</h3> <p> "Changes to grid for R 3.0.0", Paul Murrell, <em>The R Journal</em> (2013) 5:2, pages 148-160. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="grid.draw.html">grid.draw</a></code> and <code><a href="makecontent.html">makeContent</a></code> </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
