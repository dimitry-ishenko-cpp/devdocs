<h2>
<code>drawDetails</code>  Customising grid Drawing </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>These generic hook functions are called whenever a grid grob is drawn. They provide an opportunity for customising the drawing of a new class derived from grob (or gTree). </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
drawDetails(x, recording)
preDrawDetails(x)
postDrawDetails(x)
</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>x</code></td> <td> <p> A grid grob. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>recording</code></td> <td> <p> A logical value indicating whether a grob is being added to the display list or redrawn from the display list. </p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>These functions are called by the <code>grid.draw</code> methods for grobs and gTrees. </p> <p><code>preDrawDetails</code> is called first during the drawing of a grob. This is where any additional viewports should be pushed (see, for example, <code>grid:::preDrawDetails.frame</code>). Note that the default behaviour for grobs is to push any viewports in the <code>vp</code> slot, and for gTrees is to also push and up any viewports in the <code>childrenvp</code> slot so there is typically nothing to do here. </p> <p><code>drawDetails</code> is called next and is where any additional calculations and graphical output should occur (see, for example, <code>grid:::drawDetails.xaxis</code>). Note that the default behaviour for gTrees is to draw all grobs in the <code>children</code> slot so there is typically nothing to do here. </p> <p><code>postDrawDetails</code> is called last and should reverse anything done in <code>preDrawDetails</code> (i.e., pop or up any viewports that were pushed; again, see, for example, <code>grid:::postDrawDetails.frame</code>). Note that the default behaviour for grobs is to pop any viewports that were pushed so there is typically nothing to do here. </p> <p>Note that <code>preDrawDetails</code> and <code>postDrawDetails</code> are also called in the calculation of <code>"grobwidth"</code> and <code>"grobheight"</code> units. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>None of these functions are expected to return a value. </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p> Paul Murrell </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="grid.draw.html">grid.draw</a></code> </p><div class="_attribution">
