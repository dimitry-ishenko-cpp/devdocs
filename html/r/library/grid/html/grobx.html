<code>grobX</code> Create a Unit Describing a Grob Boundary Location</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>These functions create a unit object describing a location somewhere on the boundary of a grob. They are generic. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">grobX(x, theta)
grobY(x, theta)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td> <td> <p>A grob, or gList, or gTree, or gPath.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="theta">theta</code></td> <td> <p>An angle indicating where the location is on the grob boundary. Can be one of <code>"east"</code>, <code>"north"</code>, <code>"west"</code>, or <code>"south"</code>, which correspond to angles 0, 90, 180, and 270, respectively.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The angle is anti-clockwise with zero corresponding to a line with an origin centred between the extreme points of the shape, and pointing at 3 o'clock. </p> <p>If the grob describes a single shape, the boundary value should correspond to the exact edge of the shape. </p> <p>If the grob describes multiple shapes, the boundary value will either correspond to the edge of a bounding box around all of the shapes described by the grob (for multiple rectangles, circles, xsplines, or text), or to a convex hull around all vertices of all shapes described by the grob (for multiple polygons, points, lines, polylines, and segments). </p> <p>Points grobs are currently a special case because the convex hull is based on the data symbol <em>locations</em> and does not take into account the extent of the data symbols themselves. </p> <p>The extents of any arrow heads are currently <em>not</em> taken into account. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>A unit object. </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p>Paul Murrell</p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="unit.html">unit</a></code> and <code><a href="grobwidth.html">grobWidth</a></code> </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
