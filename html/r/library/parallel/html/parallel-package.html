<code>parallel-package</code>  Support for Parallel Computation </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Support for parallel computation, including random-number generation. </p> <h3>Details</h3> <p>This package was first included with <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> 2.14.0 in 2011. </p> <p>There is support for multiple RNG streams with the ‘<span class="samp">⁠"L'Ecuyer-CMRG"⁠</span>’ <a href="../../base/html/random.html">RNG</a>: see <code><a href="rngstream.html">nextRNGStream</a></code>. </p> <p>It contains functionality derived from and pretty much equivalent to that contained in packages <span class="pkg">multicore</span> (formerly on <abbr>CRAN</abbr>, with some low-level functions renamed and not exported) and <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=snow"><span class="pkg">snow</span></a> (for socket clusters only, but MPI clusters generated by <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=snow"><span class="pkg">snow</span></a> are also supported). There have been many enhancements and bug fixes since 2011. </p> <p>This package also provides <code><a href="makecluster.html">makeForkCluster</a></code> to create socket clusters by forking (not Windows). </p> <p>For a complete list of exported functions, use <code>library(help = "parallel")</code>. </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p>Brian Ripley, Luke Tierney and Simon Urbanek </p> <p>Maintainer: R Core Team <a href="mailto:R-core@r-project.org.html">R-core@r-project.org</a> </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p>Parallel computation involves launching worker processes: functions <code><a href="../../tools/html/psnice.html">psnice</a></code> and <code><a href="../../tools/html/pskill.html">pskill</a></code> in package <span class="pkg">tools</span> provide means to manage such processes. </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
