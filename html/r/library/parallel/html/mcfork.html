<code>mcfork</code> Fork a Copy of the Current R Process</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>These are low-level functions, not available on Windows, and not exported from the namespace. </p> <p><code>mcfork</code> creates a new child process as a copy of the current <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> process. </p> <p><code>mcexit</code> closes the current child process, informing the master process as necessary. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">mcfork(estranged = FALSE)

mcexit(exit.code = 0L, send = NULL)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="estranged">estranged</code></td> <td> <p>logical, if <code>TRUE</code> then the new process has no ties to the parent process, will not show in the list of children and will not be killed on exit.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="exit.code">exit.code</code></td> <td> <p>process exit code. By convention <code>0L</code> signifies a clean exit, <code>1L</code> an error.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="send">send</code></td> <td> <p>if not <code>NULL</code> send this data before exiting (equivalent to using <code><a href="children.html">sendMaster</a></code>).</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The <code>mcfork</code> function provides an interface to the <code>fork</code> system call. In addition it sets up a pipe between the master and child process that can be used to send data from the child process to the master (see <code><a href="children.html">sendMaster</a></code>) and child's ‘<span class="file">stdin</span>’ is re-mapped to another pipe held by the master process (see <code><a href="children.html">sendChildStdin</a></code>). </p> <p>If you are not familiar with the <code>fork</code> system call, do not use this function directly as it leads to very complex inter-process interactions amongst the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> processes involved. </p> <p>In a nutshell <code>fork</code> spawns a copy (child) of the current process, that can work in parallel to the master (parent) process. At the point of forking both processes share exactly the same state including the workspace, global options, loaded packages etc. Forking is relatively cheap in modern operating systems and no real copy of the used memory is created, instead both processes share the same memory and only modified parts are copied. This makes <code>mcfork</code> an ideal tool for parallel processing since there is no need to setup the parallel working environment, data and code is shared automatically from the start. </p> <p><code>mcexit</code> is to be run in the child process. It sends <code>send</code> to the master (unless <code>NULL</code>) and then shuts down the child process. The child can also be shut down by sending it the signal <code>SIGUSR1</code>, as is done by the unexported function <code>parallel:::rmChild</code>. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p><code>mcfork</code> returns an object of the class <code>"childProcess"</code> to the master and of class <code>"masterProcess"</code> to the child: both the classes inherit from class <code>"process"</code>. If <code>estranged</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> then the child process will be of the class <code>"estrangedProcess"</code> and cannot communicate with the master process nor will it show up on the list of children. These are lists with components <code>pid</code> (the process id of the <em>other</em> process) and a vector <code>fd</code> of the two file descriptor numbers for ends in the current process of the inter-process pipes. </p> <p><code>mcexit</code> never returns. </p> <h3>GUI/embedded environments</h3> <p>It is <em>strongly discouraged</em> to use <code>mcfork</code> and the higher-level functions which rely on it (e.g., <code>mcparallel</code>, <code>mclapply</code> and <code>pvec</code>) in GUI or embedded environments, because it leads to several processes sharing the same GUI which will likely cause chaos (and possibly crashes). Child processes should never use on-screen graphics devices. Some precautions have been taken to make this usable in <code>R.app</code> on macOS, but users of third-party front-ends should consult their documentation. </p> <p>This can also apply to other connections (e.g., to an X server) created before forking, and to files opened by e.g. graphics devices. </p> <p>Note that <span class="pkg">tcltk</span> counts as a GUI for these purposes since <code>Tcl</code> runs an event loop. That event loop is inhibited in a child process but there could still be problems with Tk graphical connections. </p> <p>It is <em>strongly discouraged</em> to use <code>mcfork</code> and the higher-level functions in any multi-threaded R process (with additional threads created by a third-party library or package). Such use can lead to deadlocks or crashes, because the child process created by <code>mcfork</code> may not be able to access resources locked in the parent or may see an inconsistent version of global data (<code>mcfork</code> runs system call <code>fork</code> without <code>exec</code>). </p> <p>If in doubt, it is safer to use a non-FORK cluster (see <code><a href="makecluster.html">makeCluster</a></code>, <code><a href="clusterapply.html">clusterApply</a></code>). </p> <h3>Warning</h3> <p>This is a very low-level API for expert use only. </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p>Simon Urbanek and R Core. </p> <p>Derived from the <span class="pkg">multicore</span> package formerly on <abbr>CRAN</abbr>. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="mcparallel.html">mcparallel</a></code>, <code><a href="children.html">sendMaster</a></code> </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">
