<code>read.octave</code> Read Octave Text Data Files</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Read a file in Octave text data format into a list. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">read.octave(file)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="file">file</code></td> <td> <p>a character string with the name of the file to read.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>This function is used to read in files in Octave text data format, as created by <code>save -text</code> in Octave. It knows about most of the common types of variables, including the standard atomic (real and complex scalars, matrices, and <code class="reqn">N</code>-d arrays, strings, ranges, and boolean scalars and matrices) and recursive (structs, cells, and lists) ones, but has no guarantee to read all types. If a type is not recognized, a warning indicating the unknown type is issued, it is attempted to skip the unknown entry, and <code>NULL</code> is used as its value. Note that this will give incorrect results, and maybe even errors, in the case of unknown recursive data types. </p> <p>As Octave can read MATLAB binary files, one can make the contents of such files available to R by using Octave's load and save (as text) facilities as an intermediary step. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>A list with one named component for each variable in the file. </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p>Stephen Eglen <a href="mailto:stephen@gnu.org.html">stephen@gnu.org</a> and Kurt Hornik</p> <h3>References</h3> <p><a href="https://octave.org/">https://octave.org/</a></p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
