<code>survexp.fit</code>  Compute Expected Survival </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Compute expected survival times. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">survexp.fit(group, x, y, times, death, ratetable)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="group">group</code></td> <td> <p>if there are multiple survival curves this identifies the group, otherwise it is a constant. Must be an integer.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td> <td> <p>A matrix whose columns match the dimensions of the <code>ratetable</code>, in the correct order. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="y">y</code></td> <td> <p>the follow up time for each subject. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="times">times</code></td> <td> <p>the vector of times at which a result will be computed. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="death">death</code></td> <td> <p>a logical value, if <code>TRUE</code> the conditional survival is computed, if <code>FALSE</code> the cohort survival is computed. See <code><a href="survexp.html">survexp</a></code> for more details. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="ratetable">ratetable</code></td> <td> <p>a rate table, such as <code>survexp.uswhite</code>. </p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>For conditional survival <code>y</code> must be the time of last follow-up or death for each subject. For cohort survival it must be the potential censoring time for each subject, ignoring death. </p> <p>For an exact estimate <code>times</code> should be a superset of <code>y</code>, so that each subject at risk is at risk for the entire sub-interval of time. For a large data set, however, this can use an inordinate amount of storage and/or compute time. If the <code>times</code> spacing is more coarse than this, an actuarial approximation is used which should, however, be extremely accurate as long as all of the returned values are &gt; .99. </p> <p>For a subgroup of size 1 and <code>times</code> &gt; <code>y</code>, the conditional method reduces to exp(-h) where h is the expected cumulative hazard for the subject over his/her observation time. This is used to compute individual expected survival. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>A list containing the number of subjects and the expected survival(s) at each time point. If there are multiple groups, these will be matrices with one column per group. </p> <h3>Warning</h3> <p>Most users will call the higher level routine <code>survexp</code>. Consequently, this function has very few error checks on its input arguments. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="survexp.html">survexp</a></code>, <code><a href="survexp.us.html">survexp.us</a></code>. </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
