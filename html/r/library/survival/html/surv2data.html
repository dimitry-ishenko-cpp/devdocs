<code>Surv2data</code> Convert data from timecourse to (time1,time2) style </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The multi-state survival functions <code>coxph</code> and <code>survfit</code> allow for two forms of input data. This routine converts between them. The function is normally called behind the scenes when <code>Surv2</code> is as the response. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">Surv2data(formula, data, subset, id)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="formula">formula</code></td> <td> <p>a model formula</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="data">data</code></td> <td> <p>a data frame</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="subset">subset</code></td> <td> <p>optional, selects rows of the data to be retained</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="id">id</code></td> <td> <p>a variable that identified multiple rows for the same subject, normally found in the referenced data set</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>For timeline style data, each row is uniquely identified by an (identifier, time) pair. The time could be a date, time from entry to a study, age, etc, (there may often be more than one time variable). The identifier and time cannot be missing. The remaining covariates represent values that were observed at that time point. Often, a given covariate is observed at only a subset of times and is missing at others. At the time of death, in particular, often only the identifier, time, and status indicator are known. </p> <p>In the resulting data set missing covariates are replaced by their last known value, and the response y will be a Surv(time1, time2, endpoint) object. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>a list with elements </p> <table> <tr>
<td><code>mf</code></td> <td> <p>an updated model frame (fewer rows, unchanged columns)</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>S2.y</code></td> <td> <p>the constructed response variable</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>S2.state</code></td> <td> <p>the current state for each of the rows</p> </td>
</tr> </table> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
