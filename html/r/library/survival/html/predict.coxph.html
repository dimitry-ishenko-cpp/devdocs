Choices are the linear predictor (<code>"lp"</code>), the risk score exp(lp) (<code>"risk"</code>), the expected number of events given the covariates and follow-up time (<code>"expected"</code>), and the terms of the linear predictor (<code>"terms"</code>).

</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The Cox model is a <em>relative</em> risk model; predictions of type "linear predictor", "risk", and "terms" are all relative to the sample from which they came. By default, the reference value for each of these is the mean covariate within strata. The underlying reason is both statistical and practial. First, a Cox model only predicts relative risks between pairs of subjects within the same strata, and hence the addition of a constant to any covariate, either overall or only within a particular stratum, has no effect on the fitted results. Second, downstream calculations depend on the risk score exp(linear predictor), which will fall prey to numeric overflow for a linear predictor greater than <code>.Machine\$double.max.exp</code>. The <code>coxph</code> routines try to approximately center the predictors out of self protection. Using the <code>reference="strata"</code> option is the safest centering, since strata occassionally have different means. When the results of <code>predict</code> are used in further calculations it may be desirable to use a single reference level for all observations. Use of <code>reference="sample"</code> will use <code>object$means</code>, which agrees with the <code>linear.predictors</code> component of the coxph object. Predictions of <code>type="terms"</code> are almost invariably passed forward to further calculation, so for these we default to using the sample as the reference. A reference of <code>"zero"</code> causes no centering to be done. </p> <p>Predictions of type "expected" or "survival" incorporate the baseline hazard and are thus absolute instead of relative; the <code>reference</code> option has no effect on these. These values depend on the follow-up time for the future subjects as well as covariates so the <code>newdata</code> argument needs to include both the right and <em>left</em> hand side variables from the formula. (The status variable will not be used, but is required since the underlying code needs to reconstruct the entire formula.) </p> <p>Models that contain a <code>frailty</code> term are a special case: due to the technical difficulty, when there is a <code>newdata</code> argument the predictions will always be for a random effect of zero. </p> <p>For predictions of type expected a user will normally want to use <code class="reqn">\Lambda(t_i)</code>, i.e., the cumulative hazard at the individual follow-up time <code class="reqn">t_i</code>of each individual subject. This is E in the martingale residual O-E and plays a natural role in assessments of model validation (Crowson 2016). For predictions of type survival, on the other hand, a user will normally want S(tau), where tau is a single pre-specified time point which is the same for all subjects, e.g., predicted 5 year survival. The <code>newdata</code> data set should contain actual survival time(s) for each subject for the first case, as the survival time variable(s), and the target time tau in the second case; (0, tau) for (time1, time2) data. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>a vector or matrix of predictions, or a list containing the predictions (element "fit") and their standard errors (element "se.fit") if the se.fit option is TRUE. </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>Some predictions can be obtained directly from the coxph object, and for others it is necessary for the routine to have the entirety of the original data set, e.g., for type = <code>terms</code> or if standard errors are requested. This extra information is saved in the coxph object if <code>model=TRUE</code>, if not the original data is reconstructed. If it is known that such residuals will be required overall execution will be slightly faster if the model information is saved. </p> <p>In some cases the reconstruction can fail. The most common is when coxph has been called inside another function and the formula was passed as one of the arguments to that enclosing function. Another is when the data set has changed between the original call and the time of the prediction call. In each of these the simple solution is to add <code>model=TRUE</code> to the original coxph call. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>C Crowson, E Atkinson and T Therneau, Assessing calibration of prognostic risk scores, Stat Methods Med Res, 2016. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="../../stats/html/predict.html">predict</a></code>,<code><a href="coxph.html">coxph</a></code>,<code><a href="../../stats/html/termplot.html">termplot</a></code> </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">options(na.action=na.exclude) # retain NA in predictions
