<code>concordance</code> Compute the concordance statistic for data or a model</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The concordance statistic compute the agreement between an observed response and a predictor. It is closely related to Kendall's tau-a and tau-b, Goodman's gamma, and Somers' d, all of which can also be calculated from the results of this function. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">concordance(object, ...)

</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="object">object</code></td> <td> <p>a fitted model or a formula. The formula should be of the form <code>y ~x</code> or <code>y ~ x + strata(z)</code> with a single numeric or survival response and a single predictor. Counts of concordant, discordant and tied pairs are computed separately per stratum, and then added. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="data">data</code></td> <td> <p>a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in the <code>formula</code>, or in the <code>subset</code> and the <code>weights</code> argument. Only applicable if <code>object</code> is a formula. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="weights">weights</code></td> <td> <p>optional vector of case weights. Only applicable if <code>object</code> is a formula. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="subset">subset</code></td> <td> <p>expression indicating which subset of the rows of data should be used in the fit. Only applicable if <code>object</code> is a formula. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="na.action">na.action</code></td> <td> <p>a missing-data filter function. This is applied to the model.frame after any subset argument has been used. Default is <code>options()\$na.action</code>. Only applicable if <code>object</code> is a formula. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="...">...</code></td> <td> <p>multiple fitted models are allowed. Only applicable if <code>object</code> is a model object.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>

</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="cluster">cluster</code></td> <td> <p>optional grouping vector for calculating the robust variance</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>
<code id="ymin">ymin</code>, <code id="ymax">ymax</code>
</td> <td> <p>compute the concordance over the restricted range ymin &lt;= y &lt;= ymax. (For survival data this is a time range.) </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="timewt">timewt</code></td> <td> <p>the weighting to be applied. The overall statistic is a weighted mean over event times. </p> </td>

</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="reverse">reverse</code></td> <td> <p>if TRUE then assume that larger <code>x</code> values predict smaller response values <code>y</code>; a proportional hazards model is the common example of this, larger hazard = shorter survival.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="timefix">timefix</code></td> <td> <p>correct for possible rounding error. See the vignette on tied times for more explanation. Essentially, exact ties are an important part of the concordance computatation, but "exact" can be a subtle issue with floating point numbers. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="keepstrata">keepstrata</code></td> <td> <p>either TRUE, FALSE, or an integer value. Computations are always done within stratum, then added. If the total number of strata greater than <code>keepstrata</code>, or <code>keepstrata=FALSE</code>, those subtotals are not kept in the output. </p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The concordance is an estimate of <code class="reqn">Pr(x_i &lt; x_j | y_i &lt; y_j)</code>, for a model fit replace <code class="reqn">x</code> with <code class="reqn">\hat y</code>, the predicted response from the model. For a survival outcome some pairs of values are not comparable, e.g., censored at time 5 and a death at time 6, as we do not know if the first observation will or will not outlive the second. In this case the total number of evaluable pairs is smaller. </p> <p>Relatations to other statistics: For continuous x and y, 2C- 1 is equal to Somers' d. If the response is binary, C is equal to the area under the receiver operating curve or AUC. For a survival response and binary predictor C is the numerator of the Gehan-Wilcoxon test. </p> <p>A naive compuation requires adding up over all n(n-1)/2 comparisons, which can be quite slow for large data sets. This routine uses an O(n log(n)) algorithm. At each uncensored event time y, compute the rank of x for the subject who had the event as compared to the x values for all others with a longer survival, where the rank has value between 0 and 1. The concordance is a weighted mean of these ranks, determined by the <code>timewt</code> option. The rank vector can be efficiently updated as subjects are added to the risk set. For further details see the vignette. </p> <p>The variance is based on an infinetesimal jackknife. One advantage of this approach is that it also gives a valid covariance for the covariance based on multiple different predicted values, even if those predictions come from quite different models. See for instance the example below which has a poisson and two non-nested Cox models. This has been useful to compare a machine learning model to a Cox model fit, say. It is absolutely critical, however, that the predicted values line up exactly, with the same observation in each row; otherwise the result will be nonsense. (Be alert to the impact of missing values.) </p> <p>The <code>timewt</code> option is only applicable to censored data. In this case the default corresponds to Harrell's C statistic, which is closely related to the Gehan-Wilcoxon test; <code>timewt="S"</code> corrsponds to the Peto-Wilcoxon, <code>timewt="S/G"</code> is suggested by Schemper, and <code>timewt="n/G2"</code> corresponds to Uno's C. It turns out that the Schemper and Uno weights are computationally identical, we have retained both option labels as a user convenience. The <code>timewt= "I"</code> option is related to the log-rank statistic. </p> <p>When the number of strata is very large, such as in a conditional logistic regression for instance (<code>clogit</code> function), a much faster computation is available when the individual strata results are not retained; use <code>keepstrata=FALSE</code> or <code>keepstrata=0</code> to do so. In the general case the <code>keepstrata = 10</code> default simply keeps the printout managable: it retains and prints per-strata counts if the number of strata is &lt;= 10. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>An object of class <code>concordance</code> containing the following components: </p> <table> <tr>
<td><code>concordance</code></td> <td> <p>the estimated concordance value or values</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>count</code></td> <td> <p>a vector containing the number of concordant pairs, discordant, tied on x but not y, tied on y but not x, and tied on both x and y</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>n</code></td> <td> <p>the number of observations</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>var</code></td> <td> <p>a vector containing the estimated variance of the concordance based on the infinitesimal jackknife (IJ) method. If there are multiple models it contains the estimtated variance/covariance matrix.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>cvar</code></td> <td> <p>a vector containing the estimated variance(s) of the concordance values, based on the variance formula for the associated score test from a proportional hazards model. (This was the primary variance used in the <code>survConcordance</code> function.)</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>dfbeta</code></td> <td> <p>optional, the vector of leverage estimates for the concordance</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>influence</code></td> <td> <p>optional, the matrix of leverage values for each of the counts, one row per observation</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>ranks</code></td> <td> <p>optional, a data frame containing the Somers' d rank at each event time, along with the time weight, and the case weight of the observation. The time weighted sum of the ranks will equal concordant pairs - discordant pairs.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Note</h3> <p>A coxph model that has a numeric failure may have undefined predicted values, in which case the concordance will be NULL. </p> <p>Computation for an existing coxph model along with <code>newdata</code> has some subtleties with respect to extra arguments in the original call. These include </p> <ul> <li>
<p> tt() terms in the model. This is not supported with newdata. </p> </li> <li>
<p> subset. Any subset clause in the original call is ignored, i.e., not applied to the new data. </p> </li> <li>
<p> strata() terms in the model. The new data is expected to have the strata variable(s) found in the original data set, with concordance computed within strata. The levels of the strata variable need not be the same as in the original data. </p> </li> <li>
<p> id or cluster directives. This has not yet been sorted out. </p> </li>
