</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>This routine will examine a multi-state data set for consistency of the data. The basic rules are that if a subject is at risk they have to be somewhere, can not be two states at once, and should make sensible transitions from state to state. It reports the number of instances of the following conditions: </p> <dl> <dt>overlap</dt>
<dd>
<p>two observations for the same subject that overlap in time, e.g. intervals of (0, 100) and (90, 120). If <code>y</code> is simple (time, status) survival observation intervals implicitly start at 0, so in that case any duplicate identifiers will generate an overlap.</p> </dd> <dt>jump</dt>
<dd>
<p>a hole in a subject's timeline, where they are in one state at the end of the prior interval, but a new state in the at the start subsequent interval.</p> </dd> <dt>gap</dt>
<dd>
<p>one or more gaps in a subject's timeline; they are presumably in the same state at their return as when they left.</p> </dd> <dt>teleport</dt>
<dd>
<p>two adjacent intervals for a subject, with the first interval ending in one state and the subsequent interval starting in another. They have instantaneously changed states with experiencing a transition.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>The total number of occurences of each is present in the <code>flags</code> vector. Optional components give the location and identifiers of the flagged observations. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>a list with components </p> <table summary="R valueblock"> <tr valign="top">

</tr> </table> <h3>Note</h3> <p>For data sets with time-dependent covariates, a given subject will often have intermediate rows with a status of ‘no event at this time’. (numeric value of 0). For instance a subject who started in state 1 at time 0, transitioned to state 2 at time 10, had a covariate <code>x</code> change from 135 to 156 at time 20, and a final transition to state 3 at time 30. The response would be <code>Surv(c(0, 10, 20), c(10, 20, 30), c(2,0,3))</code>: the status variable records <em>changes</em> in state, and there was no change at time 20. The <code>istate</code> variable would be (1, 2, 2); it contains the <em>current</em> state, and so the value is unchanged when status = censored. </p> <p>Thus, when there are intermediate observations <code>istate</code> is not simply a lagged version of the status, and may be more challenging to create. One approach is to let <code>survcheck</code> do the work: call it with an <code>istate</code> argument that is correct for the first row of each subject, or no <code>istate</code> argument at all, and then insert the returned value into ones data frame. </p><div class="_attribution">
