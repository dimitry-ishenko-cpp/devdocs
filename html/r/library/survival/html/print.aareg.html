print(x, maxtime, test=c("aalen", "nrisk"),scale=1,...)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td> <td> <p>the result of a call to the <code>aareg</code> function </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="maxtime">maxtime</code></td> <td> <p>the upper time point to be used in the test for non-zero slope </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="test">test</code></td> <td> <p>the weighting to be used in the test for non-zero slope. The default weights are based on the variance of each coefficient, as a function of time. The alternative weight is proportional to the number of subjects still at risk at each time point. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="scale">scale</code></td> <td> <p>scales the coefficients. For some data sets, the coefficients of the Aalen model will be very small (10-4); this simply multiplies the printed values by a constant, say 1e6, to make the printout easier to read.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="...">...</code></td> <td> <p>for future methods</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The estimated increments in the coefficient estimates can become quite unstable near the end of follow-up, due to the small number of observations still at risk in a data set. Thus, the test for slope will sometimes be more powerful if this last ‘tail’ is excluded. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>the calling argument is returned. </p> <h3>Side Effects</h3> <p>the results of the fit are displayed. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>Aalen, O.O.
