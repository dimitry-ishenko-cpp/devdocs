<code>survexp.object</code>  Expected Survival Curve Object </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>This class of objects is returned by the <code>survexp</code> class of functions to represent a fitted survival curve. </p> <p>Objects of this class have methods for <code>summary</code>, and inherit the <code>print</code>, <code>plot</code>, <code>points</code> and <code>lines</code> methods from <code>survfit</code>. </p> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="surv">surv</code></td> <td> <p>the estimate of survival at time t+0. This may be a vector or a matrix. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="n.risk">n.risk</code></td> <td> <p>the number of subjects who contribute at this time. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="time">time</code></td> <td> <p>the time points at which the curve has a step. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="std.err">std.err</code></td> <td> <p>the standard error of the cumulative hazard or -log(survival). </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="strata">strata</code></td> <td> <p>if there are multiple curves, this component gives the number of elements of the <code>time</code> etc. vectors corresponding to the first curve, the second curve, and so on. The names of the elements are labels for the curves. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="method">method</code></td> <td> <p>the estimation method used. One of "Ederer", "Hakulinen", or "conditional".</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="na.action">na.action</code></td> <td> <p>the returned value from the na.action function, if any. It will be used in the printout of the curve, e.g., the number of observations deleted due to missing values. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="call">call</code></td> <td> <p>an image of the call that produced the object. </p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Structure</h3> <p>The following components must be included in a legitimate <code>survfit</code> object. </p> <h3>Subscripts</h3> <p>Survexp objects that contain multiple survival curves can be subscripted. This is most often used to plot a subset of the curves. </p> <h3>Details</h3> <p>In expected survival each subject from the data set is matched to a hypothetical person from the parent population, matched on the characteristics of the parent population. The number at risk printed here is the number of those hypothetical subject who are still part of the calculation. In particular, for the Ederer method all hypotheticals are retained for all time, so <code>n.risk</code> will be a constant. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="plot.survfit.html">plot.survfit</a></code>, <code><a href="summary.survexp.html">summary.survexp</a></code>, <code><a href="print.survfit.html">print.survfit</a></code>, <code><a href="survexp.html">survexp</a></code>. </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
