<dd>
<p>a risk score for the eye. This high risk subset is defined as a score of 6 or greater in at least one eye.</p> </dd> </dl> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The 197 patients in this dataset were a 50% random sample of the patients with "high-risk" diabetic retinopathy as defined by the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS). Each patient had one eye randomized to laser treatment and the other eye received no treatment, and has two observations in the data set. For each eye, the event of interest was the time from initiation of treatment to the time when visual acuity dropped below 5/200 two visits in a row. Thus there is a built-in lag time of approximately 6 months (visits were every 3 months). Survival times in this dataset are the actual time to vision loss in months, minus the minimum possible time to event (6.5 months). Censoring was caused by death, dropout, or end of the study. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>W. J. Huster, R. Brookmeyer and S. G. Self (1989).
