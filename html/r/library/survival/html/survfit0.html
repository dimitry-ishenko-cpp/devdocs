<code>survfit0</code>  Convert the format of a survfit object. </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Add the point for a starting time ("time 0") to a survfit object's elements. This is useful for plotting. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">survfit0(x, ...)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td> <td> <p>a survfit object</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="...">...</code></td> <td> <p>any other arguments are ignored</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>Survival curves are traditionally plotted forward from time 0, but since the true starting time is not known as a part of the data, the <code>survfit</code> routine does not include a time 0 value in the resulting object. Someone might look at cumulative mortgage defaults versus calendar year, for instance, with the ‘time’ value a Date object. The plotted curve probably should not start at 0 = 1970-01-01. Due to this uncertainty, it was decided not to include a "time 0" as part of a survfit object. Whether that (1989) decision was wise or foolish, it is now far too late to change it. (We tried it once as a trial, resulting in over 20 errors in the survival test suite. We extrapolated that it might break 1/3 of the other CRAN packages that depend on survival, if made a default.) Many curves do include a value <code>t0</code> for "time 0", which is where the survfit routine has surmised that the curve would start. </p> <p>One problem with this choice is that some functions must choose a starting point, plots and computation of the restricted mean survival time are two primary examples. This utility function is used by <code>plot.survfit</code> and <code>summary.survfit</code> to fill in that gap. </p> <p>The value used for this first time point is the first one below </p> <ol> <li>
<p> a <code>t0</code> value found in the in the object. </p> </li> <li>
<p> for single state survival </p> <ul> <li>
<p> min(0, time) for Surv(time, status) data </p> </li> <li>
<p> min(time1) for Surv(time1, time2, status) data </p> </li>
</ul> </li> <li>
<p> for multi state survival </p> <ul> <li>
<p> min(0, time) for Surv(time, event) data, e.g., competing risks </p> </li> <li>
<p> min(time1) for Surv(time1, time2, event) data, if everyone starts in the same state </p> </li>
</ul> </li>
</ol> <p>(Remember that negative times are allowed in Surv objects.) </p> <p>This function will add a new time point at the front of each curve, but only if said time point is less than existing points in the curve. If there were a death on day 0, for instance, it will not add a (time=0, survival=1) point. (The question of whether the plotted curve in this case should or should not start with a vertical segment can be debated ad nauseum. It has no effect on the area under the curve (RMST), and the summary for time 0 should report the smaller value.) </p> <p>The resulting object is <em>not</em> currently guarranteed to work with functions that further manipulate a <code>survfit</code> object such as subscripting, aggregation, pseudovalues, etc. (remember the 20 errors). Rather it is intended as a penultimate step, most often when creating a plot or summary of the curve(s). </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>a reformulated version of the object with an initial data point added. The <code>time</code>, <code>surv</code>, <code>pstate</code>, <code>cumhaz</code>, <code>std.err</code>, <code>std.cumhaz</code> and other components will all be aligned, so as to make plots and summaries easier to produce. </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
