<h2>
<code>survfit0</code>  Convert the format of a survfit object. </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Add the point for a starting time (time 0) to a survfit object's elements. This is useful for plotting. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
survfit0(x, start.time=0)
</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>x</code></td> <td> <p>a survfit object</p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>start.time</code></td> <td> <p>the desired starting time; see details below.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>Survival curves are traditionally plotted forward from time 0, but since the true starting time is not known as a part of the data, the <code>survfit</code> routine does not include a time 0 value in the resulting object. Someone might look at cumulative mortgage defaults versus calendar year, for instance, with the ‘time’ value a Date object. The plotted curve probably should not start at 0 = 1970/01/01. Due to this uncertainty, it was decided not to include a "time 0" as part of a survfit object. If the original <code>survfit</code> call included a <code>start.time</code> argument, that value is of course retained. </p> <p>Whether that (1989) decision was wise or foolish, it is now far too late to change it. (We tried it once as a trial, resulting in over 20 errors in the survival test suite. We extrapolate that it might break 1/2 - 2/3 of the other CRAN packages that depend on survival, if made a default.) If the original <code>survfit</code> call included a <code>start.time</code> argument, that value is of course retained. </p> <p>One problem with this choice is that some functions must choose a starting point, plots for example. This utility function is used by <code>plot.survfit</code> and <code>summary.survfit</code> to do so, adding a new time point at the front of each curve in a consistent way: the optional argument to the <code>survfit0</code> function as the first choice (if supplied), then the user's <code>start.time</code> if present, otherwise <code>min(0, x$time)</code>. The resulting object is <em>not</em> guarranteed to work with functions that further manipulate a <code>survfit</code> object such as subscripting, aggregation, pseudovalues, etc. (remember the 20 errors). Rather it is intended as a penultimate step, most often when creating a plot. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>a reformulated version of the object with an initial data point at <code>start.time</code> added. The <code>time</code>, <code>surv</code>, <code>pstate</code>, <code>cumhaz</code>, <code>std.err</code>, <code>std.cumhaz</code> and other components will all be aligned, so as to make plots and summaries easier to produce. </p><div class="_attribution">
