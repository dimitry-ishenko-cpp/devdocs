<code>survfit.object</code>  Survival Curve Object </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>This class of objects is returned by the <code>survfit</code> class of functions to represent a fitted survival curve. For a multi-state model the object has class <code>c('survfitms', 'survfit')</code>. </p> <p>Objects of this class have methods for the functions <code>print</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>plot</code>, <code>points</code> and <code>lines</code>. The <code><a href="print.survfit.html">print.survfit</a></code> method does more computation than is typical for a print method and is documented on a separate page. </p> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="n">n</code></td> <td> <p>total number of observations in each curve. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="time">time</code></td> <td> <p>the time points at which the curve has a step. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="n.risk">n.risk</code></td> <td> <p>the number of subjects at risk at t. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="n.event">n.event</code></td> <td> <p>the number of events that occur at time t. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="n.enter">n.enter</code></td> <td> <p>for counting process data only, and only if there was an <code>id</code> argument, the number of subjects that enter the risk set during the current interval. If there are event/censoring times at 1, 3, 5 for instance, someone who enters at time 1 is counted in the (1, 3] interval, i.e., appears in the row for time 3. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="n.censor">n.censor</code></td> <td> <p>for counting process data only, the number of subjects who exit the risk set, without an event, at time t. (For right censored data, this number can be computed from the successive values of the number at risk). </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="surv">surv</code></td> <td> <p>the estimate of survival at time t+0. This may be a vector or a matrix. The latter occurs when a set of survival curves is created from a single Cox model, in which case there is one column for each covariate set. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="pstate">pstate</code></td> <td> <p>a multi-state survival will have the <code>pstate</code> component instead of <code>surv</code>. It will be a matrix containing the estimated probability of each state at each time, one column per state. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="std.err">std.err</code></td> <td> <p>for a survival curve this contains standard error of the cumulative hazard or -log(survival), for a multi-state curve it contains the standard error of prev. This difference is a reflection of the fact that each is the natural calculation for that case. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="cumhaz">cumhaz</code></td> <td> <p>optional. Contains the cumulative hazard for each possible transition. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="counts">counts</code></td> <td> <p>optional. If weights were used, the <code>n.risk</code> etc elements contain weighted sums; the <code>counts</code> matrix will contain unweighted values. Weighted values are normally more useful for further computation, unweighted may be preferred for labeling or printout. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="strata">strata</code></td> <td> <p>if there are multiple curves, this component gives the number of elements of the <code>time</code> vector corresponding to the first curve, the second curve, and so on. The names of the elements are labels for the curves. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="upper">upper</code></td> <td> <p>optional upper confidence limit for the survival curve or pstate </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="lower">lower</code></td> <td> <p>options lower confidence limit for the survival curve or pstate </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="t0">t0</code></td> <td> <p>optional, the starting time for the curve</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>
<code id="p0">p0</code>, <code id="sp0">sp0</code>
</td> <td> <p>for a multistate object, the distribution of starting states. If the curve has a strata dimension, this will be a matrix one row per stratum. The <code>sp0</code> element has the standard error of p0, if p0 was estimated. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="newdata">newdata</code></td> <td> <p>for survival curves from a fitted model, this contains the covariate values for the curves </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="n.id">n.id</code></td> <td> <p>the total number of unique id values that contributed to the curve. This is only available if the original call used the id option. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="conf.type">conf.type</code></td> <td> <p>the approximation used to compute the confidence limits. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="conf.int">conf.int</code></td> <td> <p>the level of the confidence limits, e.g. 90 or 95%. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="transitions">transitions</code></td> <td> <p>for multi-state data, the total number of transitions of each type.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="na.action">na.action</code></td> <td> <p>the returned value from the na.action function, if any. It will be used in the printout of the curve, e.g., the number of observations deleted due to missing values. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="call">call</code></td> <td> <p>an image of the call that produced the object. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="type">type</code></td> <td> <p>type of survival censoring. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>
<code id="influence.p">influence.p</code>, <code id="influence.c">influence.c</code>
</td> <td> <p>optional influence matrices for the <code>pstate</code> (or <code>surv</code>) and for the <code>cumhaz</code> estimates. A list with one element per stratum, each element of the list is an array indexed by subject, time, state. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="version">version</code></td> <td> <p>the version of the object. Will be missing, 2, or 3</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Structure</h3> <p>The following components must be included in a legitimate <code>survfit</code> or <code>survfitms</code> object. </p> <h3>Subscripts</h3> <p>Survfit objects can be subscripted. This is often used to plot a subset of the curves, for instance. From the user's point of view the <code>survfit</code> object appears to be a vector, matrix, or array of curves. The first dimension is always the underlying number of curves or “strata”; for multi-state models the state is always the last dimension. Predicted curves from a Cox model can have a second dimension which is the number of different covariate prediction vectors. </p> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The <code>survfit</code> object has evolved over time: when first created there was no thought of multi-state models for instance. This evolution has almost entirely been accomplished by the addition of new elements. </p> <p>For both plots of the curves and computation of the restricted mean time in state (RMTS) we need the concept of a starting point t0 and starting prevalence of the states p0 for each curve. (Sojourn time, area under the curve and restricted mean survival time are other labels for the RMTS). Time 0 is not, by default, included as part of the standard tableau of results, i.e., time, number at risk, number of events, etc. For simple survival with a 0/1 status variable, the starting state p0 is the obvious default of "everyone alive", and t0 is formally not discernable from the data and so was left out. (A design decision made in 1986, and now far too late to change.) However, for plots t0 is assumed to be the minimum of 0 and all observed times. Negative survival times are unusual but not invalid. Multi-state survival curves include <code>t0</code> and <code>p0</code> as a part of the returned object. The first is a single value for all curves, the second is per curve. </p> <p>The <code>survfit0</code> routine can be used to add these values to the main curve data, this is done by the default print, plot, and summary methods for survfit objects. The methods vignette has discussion of the rationale of how t0 and p0 are chosen in the multi-state case. Notice that if there is an event at time t0, e.g., a death on day 0 for competing risks, then p0 will contain the prevalence just before that event occured. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="plot.survfit.html">plot.survfit</a></code>, <code><a href="summary.survfit.html">summary.survfit</a></code>, <code><a href="print.survfit.html">print.survfit</a></code>, <code><a href="survfit.html">survfit</a></code>, <code><a href="survfit0.html">survfit0</a></code> </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
