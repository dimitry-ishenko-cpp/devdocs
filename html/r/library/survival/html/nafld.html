Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in June 2023. The new name is intended to better reflect the disease's underlying causes, identify subgroups of patients, and avoid stigmatizing words. </p> <p>The incidence of MASLD has been rising rapidly in the last decade and it is now one of the main drivers of hepatology practice <cite>Tapper2018</cite>. It is essentially the presence of excess fat in the liver, and parallels the ongoing obesity epidemic. Approximately 20-25% of MASLD patients will develop the inflammatory state of metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), leading to fibrosis and eventual end-stage liver disease. MASLD can be accurately diagnosed by MRI methods, but MASH diagnosis currently requires a biopsy. </p> <p>The current study constructed a population cohort of all adult MASLD subjects from 1997 to 2014 along with 4 potential controls for each case. To protect patient confidentiality all time intervals are in days since the index date; none of the dates from the original data were retained. Subject age is their integer age at the index date, and the subject identifier is an arbitrary integer. As a final protection, we include only a 90% random sample of the data. As a consequence analyses results will not exactly match the original paper. </p> <p>There are 3 data sets: <code>nafld1</code> contains baseline data and has one observation per subject, <code>nafld2</code> has one observation for each (time dependent) continuous measurement, and <code>nafld3</code> has one observation for each yes/no outcome that occured. </p> <h3>Source</h3> <p>Data obtained from the author.</p> <h3>References</h3> <p>AM Allen, TM Therneau, JJ Larson, A Coward, VK Somers and PS Kamath, Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Incidence and Impact on Metabolic Burden and Death: A 20 Year Community Study, Hepatology 67:1726-1736, 2018. </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
