Only enough of the string to uniquely identify it is necessary. The first option causes confidence intervals not to be generated. The second causes the standard intervals <code>curve +- k *se(curve)</code>, where k is determined from <code>conf.int</code>. The log option calculates intervals based on the cumulative hazard or log(survival). The log-log option uses the log hazard or log(-log(survival)), and the logit log(survival/(1-survival)). </p> </td>

Each group of rows in <code>newdata</code> with the same subject id represents the covariate path through time of a single subject, and the result will contain one curve per subject. If the <code>coxph</code> fit had strata then that must also be specified in <code>newdata</code>.

For single state models it produces the single curve for S(t) = Pr(remain in initial state at time t), known as the survival curve; for multi-state models a matrix giving probabilities for all states. The <code>stype</code> argument states the type of estimate, and defaults to the exponential of the cumulative hazard, better known as the Breslow estimate. For a multi-state Cox model this involves the exponential of a matrix. The argument <code>stype=1</code> uses a non-exponential or ‘direct’ estimate. For a single endpoint coxph model the code evaluates the Kalbfleich-Prentice estimate, and for a multi-state model it uses an analog of the Aalen-Johansen estimator. The latter approach is the default in the <code>mstate</code> package. </p> <p>The <code>ctype</code> option affects the estimated cumulative hazard, and if <code>stype=2</code> the estimated P(state) curves as well. If not present it is chosen so as to be concordant with the <code>ties</code> option in the <code>coxph</code> call. (For multistate <code>coxphms</code> objects, only <code>ctype=1</code> is currently implemented.) Likewise the choice between a model based and robust variance estimate for the curve will mirror the choice made in the <code>coxph</code> call, any clustering is also inherited from the parent model. </p> <p>If the <code>newdata</code> argument is missing, then a curve is produced for a single "pseudo" subject with covariate values equal to the <code>means</code> component of the fit. The resulting curve(s) rarely make scientific sense, but the default remains due to an unwarranted belief by many that it represents an "average" curve, and it's use as a default in other packages. For coxph, the <code>means</code> component will contain the value 0 for any 0/1 or TRUE/FALSE variables, and the mean value in the data for others. Its primary reason for this default is to increase numerical accuracy in internal computations of the routine via recentering the X matrix; there is no reason to assume this represents an ‘interesting’ hypothetical subject for prediction of their survival curve. Users are strongly advised to use the newdata argument; predictions from a multistate coxph model require the newdata argument. </p> <p>If the <code>coxph</code> model contained an offset term, then the data set in the <code>newdata</code> argument should also contain that variable. </p> <p>When the original model contains time-dependent covariates, then the path of that covariate through time needs to be specified in order to obtain a predicted curve. This requires <code>newdata</code> to contain multiple lines for each hypothetical subject which gives the covariate values, time interval, and strata for each line (a subject can change strata), along with an <code>id</code> variable which demarks which rows belong to each subject. The time interval must have the same (start, stop, status) variables as the original model: although the status variable is not used and thus can be set to a dummy value of 0 or 1, it is necessary for the response to be recognized as a <code>Surv</code> object. Last, although predictions with a time-dependent covariate path can be useful, it is very easy to create a prediction that is senseless. Users are encouraged to seek out a text that discusses the issue in detail. </p> <p>When a model contains strata but no time-dependent covariates the user of this routine has a choice. If newdata argument does not contain strata variables then the returned object will be a matrix of survival curves with one row for each strata in the model and one column for each row in newdata. (This is the historical behavior of the routine.) If newdata does contain strata variables, then the result will contain one curve per row of newdata, based on the indicated stratum of the original model. In the rare case of a model with strata by covariate interactions the strata variable must be included in newdata, the routine does not allow it to be omitted (predictions become too confusing). (Note that the model Surv(time, status) ~ age*strata(sex) expands internally to strata(sex) + age:sex; the sex variable is needed for the second term of the model.) </p> <p>See <code><a href="survfit.html">survfit</a></code> for more details about the counts (number of events, number at risk, etc.) </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>an object of class <code>"survfit"</code>. See <code>survfit.object</code> for details. Methods defined for survfit objects are <code>print</code>, <code>plot</code>, <code>lines</code>, and <code>points</code>. </p> <h3>Notes</h3> <p>If the following pair of lines is used inside of another function then the <code>model=TRUE</code> argument must be added to the coxph call: <code>fit &lt;- coxph(...); survfit(fit)</code>. This is a consequence of the non-standard evaluation process used by the <code>model.frame</code> function when a formula is involved. </p> <p>Let <code class="reqn">\log[S(t; z)]</code> be the log of the survival curve for a fixed covariate vector <code class="reqn">z</code>, then <code class="reqn">\log[S(t; x)]= e^{(x-z)\beta}\log[S(t; z)]</code> is the log of the curve for any new covariate vector <code class="reqn">x</code>. There is an unfortunate tendency to refer to the reference curve with <code class="reqn">z=0</code> as ‘THE’ baseline hazard. However, any <code class="reqn">z</code> can be used as the reference point, and more importantly, if <code class="reqn">x-z</code> is large the compuation can suffer severe roundoff error. It is always safest to provide the desired <code class="reqn">x</code> values directly via <code>newdata</code>. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>Fleming, T. H. and Harrington, D. P. (1984).
