<code>residuals.coxph</code> Calculate Residuals for a ‘coxph’ Fit </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Calculates martingale, deviance, score or Schoenfeld residuals for a Cox proportional hazards model. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
## S3 method for class 'coxph'
residuals(object,
       type=c("martingale", "deviance", "score", "schoenfeld",
	      "dfbeta", "dfbetas", "scaledsch","partial"),
       collapse=FALSE, weighted= (type %in% c("dfbeta", "dfbetas")), ...)
## S3 method for class 'coxphms'

</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>object</code></td> <td> <p>an object inheriting from class <code>coxph</code>, representing a fitted Cox regression model. Typically this is the output from the <code>coxph</code> function. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>type</code></td> <td> <p>character string indicating the type of residual desired. Possible values are <code>"martingale"</code>, <code>"deviance"</code>, <code>"score"</code>, <code>"schoenfeld"</code>, "dfbeta"', <code>"dfbetas"</code>, <code>"scaledsch"</code> and <code>"partial"</code>. Only enough of the string to determine a unique match is required. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>collapse</code></td> <td> <p>vector indicating which rows to collapse (sum) over. In time-dependent models more than one row data can pertain to a single individual. If there were 4 individuals represented by 3, 1, 2 and 4 rows of data respectively, then <code>collapse=c(1,1,1, 2, 3,3, 4,4,4,4)</code> could be used to obtain per subject rather than per observation residuals. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>weighted</code></td> <td> <p>if <code>TRUE</code> and the model was fit with case weights, then the weighted residuals are returned. </p> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><code>...</code></td> <td> <p>other unused arguments</p> </td>
</tr>
</table> <h3>Value</h3> <p>For martingale and deviance residuals, the returned object is a vector with one element for each subject (without <code>collapse</code>). For score residuals it is a matrix with one row per subject and one column per variable. The row order will match the input data for the original fit. For Schoenfeld residuals, the returned object is a matrix with one row for each event and one column per variable. The rows are ordered by time within strata, and an attribute <code>strata</code> is attached that contains the number of observations in each strata. The scaled Schoenfeld residuals are used in the <code>cox.zph</code> function. </p> <p>The score residuals are each individual's contribution to the score vector. Two transformations of this are often more useful: <code>dfbeta</code> is the approximate change in the coefficient vector if that observation were dropped, and <code>dfbetas</code> is the approximate change in the coefficients, scaled by the standard error for the coefficients. </p> <h3>NOTE</h3> <p>For deviance residuals, the status variable may need to be reconstructed. For score and Schoenfeld residuals, the X matrix will need to be reconstructed. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>T. Therneau, P. Grambsch, and T. Fleming.
