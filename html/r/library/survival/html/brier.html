<code>brier</code> Compute the Brier score for a Cox model</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Compute the Brier score, for a coxph model</p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">brier(fit, times, newdata, ties = TRUE, detail = FALSE, timefix = TRUE, 
      efron = FALSE)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="fit">fit</code></td> <td> <p>result of a <code>coxph</code> fit</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="times">times</code></td> <td> <p>time points at which to create the score</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="newdata">newdata</code></td> <td> <p>optional, used to validate a prior fit with new data</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="ties">ties</code></td> <td> <p>if TRUE, treate tied event/censoring times properly</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="detail">detail</code></td> <td> <p>if TRUE, the returned object has more detail. This can be useful for debugging or for instruction.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="timefix">timefix</code></td> <td> <p>deal with near ties in the data. See the tied times vignette.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="efron">efron</code></td> <td> <p>use the same survival estimate for the NULL model as was used in the coxph call</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>Far more details are found in the vignette. At any time point tau, the scaled Brier score is essentially the R-squared statistic where y = the 0/1 variable "event at or before tau", yhat is the probability of an event by tau, as predicted by the model, and the ybar is the predicted probablity without covariate, normally from a Kaplan-Meier. If <code class="reqn">R^2= 1- \sum(y- \hat y)^2/\sum (y- \mu)^2</code>, the Brier score is formally only the numerator of the second term. The rescaled value is much more useful, however. </p> <p>Many, perhaps even most algorithms do not properly deal with a tied censoring time/event time pair. The <code>tied</code> option is present mostly verify that we get the same answer, when we make the same mistake. The numerical size of the inaccuracy is very small; just large enough to generate concern that this function is incorrect. </p> <p>A sensible argument can be made that the NULL model should be a <code>coxph</code> call with no covariates, rather than the Kaplan-Meier; but it turns out that the effect is very slight. This is allowed by the <code>efron</code> argument. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p> a list with components </p> <table> <tr>
<td><code>rsquared</code></td> <td> <p>the <code class="reqn">R^2</code> value, a scaled Brier score. This will be a vector with one entry for each time point.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>brier</code></td> <td> <p>the brier score, a vector with one entry per time point</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>times</code></td> <td> <p>the time points at which the score was computed</p> </td>
