<code>survSplit</code> Split a survival data set at specified times </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Given a survival data set and a set of specified cut times, split each record into multiple subrecords at each cut time. The new data set will be in ‘counting process’ format, with a start time, stop time, and event status for each record. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">survSplit(formula, data, subset, na.action=na.pass,
            cut, start="tstart", id, zero=0, episode,
                              end="tstop", event="event")
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="formula">formula</code></td> <td> <p>a model formula</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="data">data</code></td> <td> <p>a data frame</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td>
<code id="subset">subset</code>, <code id="na.action">na.action</code>
</td> <td> <p>rows of the data to be retained</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="cut">cut</code></td> <td> <p>the vector of timepoints to cut at</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="start">start</code></td> <td> <p>character string with the name of a start time variable (will be created if needed) </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="id">id</code></td> <td> <p>character string with the name of new id variable to create (optional). This can be useful if the data set does not already contain an identifier.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="zero">zero</code></td> <td> <p>If <code>start</code> doesn't already exist, this is the time that the original records start.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="episode">episode</code></td> <td> <p>character string with the name of new episode variable (optional)</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="end">end</code></td> <td> <p>character string with the name of event time variable </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="event">event</code></td> <td> <p>character string with the name of censoring indicator </p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>Each interval in the original data is cut at the given points; if an original row were (15, 60] with a cut vector of (10,30, 40) the resulting data set would have intervals of (15,30], (30,40] and (40, 60]. </p> <p>Each row in the final data set will lie completely within one of the cut intervals. Which interval for each row of the output is shown by the <code>episode</code> variable, where 1= less than the first cutpoint, 2= between the first and the second, etc. For the example above the values would be 2, 3, and 4. </p> <p>The routine is called with a formula as the first argument. The right hand side of the formula can be used to delimit variables that should be retained; normally one will use <code> ~ .</code> as a shorthand to retain them all. The routine will try to retain variable names, e.g. <code>Surv(adam, joe, fred)~.</code> will result in a data set with those same variable names for <code>tstart</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>event</code> options rather than the defaults. Any user specified values for these options will be used if they are present, of course. However, the routine is not sophisticated; it only does this substitution for simple names. A call of <code>Surv(time, stat==2)</code> for instance will not retain "stat" as the name of the event variable. </p> <p>Rows of data with a missing time or status are copied across unchanged, unless the na.action argument is changed from its default value of <code>na.pass</code>. But in the latter case any row that is missing for any variable will be removed, which is rarely what is desired. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>New, longer, data frame. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="surv.html">Surv</a></code>, <code><a href="../../base/html/cut.html">cut</a></code>, <code><a href="../../stats/html/reshape.html">reshape</a></code> </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">fit1 &lt;- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ karno + age + trt, veteran)
