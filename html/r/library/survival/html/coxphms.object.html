<code>coxphms.object</code>  Multi-state Proportional Hazards Regression Object </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>This class of objects is returned by the <code>coxph</code> class of functions to represent a fitted hazards model, when the model has multiple states. The object inherits from the <code>coxph</code> class. </p> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="states">states</code></td> <td> <p>a character vector listing the states in the model</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="cmap">cmap</code></td> <td> <p>the coefficient map. A matrix containing a column for each transition and a row for each coefficient, the value maps that transition/coefficient pair to a position in the coefficient vector. If a particular covariate is not used by a transition the matrix will contain a zero in that position, if two transitions share a coefficient the matrix will contain repeats.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="smap">smap</code></td> <td> <p>the stratum map. The row labeled ‘(Baseline)’ identifies transitions that do or do not share a baseline hazard. Further rows correspond to strata() terms in the model, each of which may apply to some transitions and not others. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="rmap">rmap</code></td> <td> <p>mapping for the residuals and linear predictors. A two column matrix with one row for each element of the vectors and two columns, the first contains the data row and the second the transition.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>In a multi-state model a set of intermediate observations is created during the computation, with a separate set of data rows for each transition. An observation (id and time interval) that is at risk for more than one transition will for instance have a linear predictor and residual for each of the potential transitions. As a result the vector of linear predictors will be longer than the number of observations. The <code>rmap</code> matrix shows the mapping. </p> <h3>Components</h3> <p>The object has all the components of a <code>coxph</code> object, with the following additions and variations. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="coxph.html">coxph</a></code>, <code><a href="coxph.object.html">coxph.object</a></code> </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
