<code>shQuote</code> Quote Strings for Use in OS Shells</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Quote a string to be passed to an operating system shell. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">shQuote(string, type = c("sh", "csh", "cmd", "cmd2"))
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="string">string</code></td> <td> <p>a character vector, usually of length one.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="type">type</code></td> <td> <p>character: the type of shell quoting. Partial matching is supported. <code>"cmd"</code> and <code>"cmd2"</code> refer to the Windows shell. <code>"cmd"</code> is the default under Windows.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The default type of quoting supported under Unix-alikes is that for the Bourne shell <code>sh</code>. If the string does not contain single quotes, we can just surround it with single quotes. Otherwise, the string is surrounded in double quotes, which suppresses all special meanings of metacharacters except dollar, backquote and backslash, so these (and of course double quote) are preceded by backslash. This type of quoting is also appropriate for <code>bash</code>, <code>ksh</code> and <code>zsh</code>. </p> <p>The other type of quoting is for the C-shell (<code>csh</code> and <code>tcsh</code>). Once again, if the string does not contain single quotes, we can just surround it with single quotes. If it does contain single quotes, we can use double quotes provided it does not contain dollar or backquote (and we need to escape backslash, exclamation mark and double quote). As a last resort, we need to split the string into pieces not containing single quotes (some may be empty) and surround each with single quotes, and the single quotes with double quotes. </p> <p>In Windows, command line interpretation is done by the application as well as the shell. It may depend on the compiler used: Microsoft's rules for the C run-time are given at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/parsing-c-command-line-arguments?view=msvc-160">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/parsing-c-command-line-arguments?view=msvc-160</a>. It may depend on the whim of the programmer of the application: check its documentation. The <code>type = "cmd"</code> prepares the string for parsing as an argument by the Microsoft's rules and makes <code>shQuote</code> safe for use with many applications when used with <code><a href="system.html">system</a></code> or <code><a href="system2.html">system2</a></code>. It surrounds the string by double quotes and escapes internal double quotes by a backslash. Any trailing backslashes and backslashes that were originally before double quotes are doubled. </p> <p>The Windows <code>cmd.exe</code> shell (used by default with <code><a href="system.html">shell</a></code>) uses <code>type = "cmd2"</code> quoting: special characters are prefixed with <code>"^"</code>. In some cases, two types of quoting should be used: first for the application, and then <code>type = "cmd2"</code> for <code>cmd.exe</code>. See the examples below. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>A character vector of the same length as <code>string</code>. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p> Loukides, M. <em>et al</em> (2002) <em>Unix Power Tools</em> Third Edition.

## Not run: system(paste("echo", shQuote(test)))
test &lt;- "don't do it!"
cat(shQuote(test), "\n")

cat(shQuote(tryit), "\n")
## Not run: system(paste("echo", shQuote(tryit)))
cat(shQuote(tryit, type = "csh"), "\n")

## Windows-only example, assuming cmd.exe:
perlcmd &lt;- 'print "Hello World\\n";'
## Not run: 
shell(shQuote(paste("perl -e", 
                    shQuote(perlcmd, type = "cmd")),
              type = "cmd2"))
