<code>La_library</code>  LAPACK Library </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Report the name of the shared object file with <code>LAPACK</code> implementation in use. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">La_library()
</code></pre> <h3>Value</h3> <p>A character vector of length one (<code>""</code> when the name is not known). The value can be used as an indication of which <code>LAPACK</code> implementation is in use. Typically, the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> version of <code>LAPACK</code> will appear as <code>libRlapack.so</code> (<code>libRlapack.dylib</code>), depending on how R was built. Note that <code>libRlapack.so</code> (<code>libRlapack.dylib</code>) may also be shown for an external <code>LAPACK</code> implementation that had been copied, hard-linked or renamed by the system administrator. Otherwise, the shared object file will be given and its path/name may indicate the vendor/version. </p> <p>The detection does not work on Windows, nor for the Accelerate framework on macOS, nor in the rare (and unsupported) case of a static external library. </p> <p>It is possible to build <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> against an enhanced BLAS which contains some but not all LAPACK routines, in which case this function reports the library containing routine <code>ILAVER</code>. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="extsoftversion.html">extSoftVersion</a></code> for versions of other third-party software including <code>BLAS</code>. </p> <p><code><a href="la_version.html">La_version</a></code> for the version of LAPACK in use. </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">La_library()
