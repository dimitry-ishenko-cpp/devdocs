<code>validUTF8</code> Check if a Character Vector is Validly Encoded</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Check if each element of a character vector is valid in its implied encoding. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">validUTF8(x)
validEnc(x)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td> <td> <p>a character vector.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>These use similar checks to those used by functions such as <code><a href="grep.html">grep</a></code>. </p> <p><code>validUTF8</code> ignores any marked encoding (see <code><a href="encoding.html">Encoding</a></code>) and so looks directly if the bytes in each string are valid UTF-8. (For the validity of ‘noncharacters’ see the help for <code><a href="utf8conversion.html">intToUtf8</a></code>.) </p> <p><code>validEnc</code> regards character strings as validly encoded unless their encodings are marked as UTF-8 or they are unmarked and the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> session is in a UTF-8 or other multi-byte locale. (The checks in other multi-byte locales depend on the OS and as with <code><a href="iconv.html">iconv</a></code> not all invalid inputs may be detected.) </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>A logical vector of the same length as <code>x</code>. <code>NA</code> elements are regarded as validly encoded. </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>It would be possible to check for the validity of character strings in a Latin-1 encoding, but extensions such as CP1252 are widely accepted as ‘Latin-1’ and 8-bit encodings rarely need to be checked for validity. </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">x &lt;-
  ## from example(text)
c("Jetz", "no", "chli", "z\xc3\xbcrit\xc3\xbc\xc3\xbctsch:",
  "(noch", "ein", "bi\xc3\x9fchen", "Z\xc3\xbc", "deutsch)",
   ## from a CRAN check log
   "\xfa\xb4\xbf\xbf\x9f")
validUTF8(x)
validEnc(x) # depends on the locale
Encoding(x) &lt;-"UTF-8"
validEnc(x) # typically the last, x[10], is invalid

## Maybe advantageous to declare it "unknown":
G &lt;- x ; Encoding(G[!validEnc(G)]) &lt;- "unknown"
try( substr(x, 1,1) ) # gives 'invalid multibyte string' error in a UTF-8 locale
try( substr(G, 1,1) ) # works in a UTF-8 locale
nchar(G) # fine, too
## but it is not "more valid" typically:
all.equal(validEnc(x),
          validEnc(G)) # typically TRUE
