<code>iconv</code> Convert Character Vector between Encodings</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>This uses system facilities to convert a character vector between encodings: the ‘i’ stands for ‘internationalization’. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">iconv(x, from = "", to = "", sub = NA, mark = TRUE, toRaw = FALSE)

iconvlist()
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td> <td> <p>a character vector, or an object to be converted to a character vector by <code><a href="character.html">as.character</a></code>, or a list with <code>NULL</code> and <code>raw</code> elements as returned by <code>iconv(toRaw = TRUE)</code>.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="from">from</code></td> <td> <p>a character string describing the current encoding.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="to">to</code></td> <td> <p>a character string describing the target encoding.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="sub">sub</code></td> <td> <p>character string. If not <code>NA</code> it is used to replace any non-convertible bytes in the input. (This would normally be a single character, but can be more.) If <code>"byte"</code>, the indication is <code>"&lt;xx&gt;"</code> with the hex code of the byte. If <code>"Unicode"</code> and converting from UTF-8, the Unicode point in the form <code>"&lt;U+xxxx&gt;"</code>, or if <code>c99</code>, a C99-style escape <code>"\uxxxx"</code>. (For points in a ‘supplementary plane’, <code>"\Uxxxxxxxx"</code> is used, with zero-padding)</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="mark">mark</code></td> <td> <p>logical, for expert use. Should encodings be marked?</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="toRaw">toRaw</code></td> <td> <p>logical. Should a list of raw vectors be returned rather than a character vector?</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The names of encodings and which ones are available are platform-dependent. All <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> platforms support <code>""</code> (for the encoding of the current locale), <code>"latin1"</code> and <code>"UTF-8"</code>. Generally case is ignored when specifying an encoding. </p> <p>On most platforms <code>iconvlist</code> provides an alphabetical list of the supported encodings. On others, the information is on the man page for <code>iconv(5)</code> or elsewhere in the man pages (but beware that the system command <code>iconv</code> may not support the same set of encodings as the C functions <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> calls). Unfortunately, the names are rarely supported across all platforms. </p> <p>Elements of <code>x</code> which cannot be converted (perhaps because they are invalid or because they cannot be represented in the target encoding) will be returned as <code>NA</code> (or <code>NULL</code> for <code>toRaw = TRUE</code>) unless <code>sub</code> is specified. </p> <p>Most versions of <code>iconv</code> will allow transliteration by appending ‘<span class="samp">⁠//TRANSLIT⁠</span>’ to the <code>to</code> encoding: see the examples. </p> <p>Encoding <code>"ASCII"</code> is accepted, and on most systems <code>"C"</code> and <code>"POSIX"</code> are synonyms for ASCII. Where <code>"ASCII/TRANSLIT"</code> is unsupported by the OS, <code>"ASCII"</code> is used with <code>sub = "c99"</code> if from UTF-8, else <code>sub =
  "?"</code>. (However, musl's version of <code>"ASCII"</code> substitutes <code>*</code>.) </p> <p>Elements of <code>x</code> with a declared encoding (UTF-8 or latin1, see <code><a href="encoding.html">Encoding</a></code>) are converted from that encoding if <code>from
  = ""</code>, otherwise they are taken as being in the encoding specified by <code>from</code>. </p> <p>Note that implementations of <code>iconv</code> typically do not do much validity checking and will often mis-convert inputs which are invalid in encoding <code>from</code>. </p> <p>If <code>sub = "Unicode"</code> or <code>sub = "c99"</code> is used for a non-UTF-8 input it is the same as <code>sub = "byte"</code>. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>If <code>toRaw = FALSE</code> (the default), the value is a character vector of the same length and the same attributes as <code>x</code> (after conversion to a character vector). If conversion fails for an element that element of the result is set to <code>NA_character_</code>. (NB: whether conversion fails is implementation-specific.) <code>NA_character_</code> inputs give <code>NA_character_</code> outputs. </p> <p>If <code>mark = TRUE</code> (the default) the elements of the result have a declared encoding if <code>to</code> is <code>"latin1"</code> or <code>"UTF-8"</code>, or if <code>to = ""</code> and the current locale's encoding is detected as Latin-1 (or its superset CP1252 on Windows) or UTF-8. </p> <p>If <code>toRaw = TRUE</code>, the value is a list of the same length and the same attributes as <code>x</code> whose elements are either <code>NULL</code> (if conversion fails or the input was <code>NA_character_</code>) or a raw vector. </p> <p>For <code>iconvlist()</code>, a character vector (typically of a few hundred elements) of known encoding names. </p> <h3>Implementation Details</h3> <p>There are three main implementations of <code>iconv</code> in use. Linux's most common C runtime, ‘<span class="samp">⁠glibc⁠</span>’, contains one. Several platforms supply versions or emulations of GNU ‘<span class="samp">⁠libiconv⁠</span>’, including previous versions of macOS and FreeBSD, in some cases with additional encodings. On Windows we use a version of Yukihiro Nakadaira's ‘<span class="samp">⁠win_iconv⁠</span>’, which is based on Windows' codepages. (We have added many encoding names for compatibility with other systems.) All three have <code>iconvlist</code>, ignore case in encoding names and support ‘<span class="samp">⁠//TRANSLIT⁠</span>’ (but with different results, and for ‘<span class="samp">⁠win_iconv⁠</span>’ currently a ‘best fit’ strategy is used except for <code>to = "ASCII"</code>). </p> <p>The macOS 14 implementation is attributed to the ‘Citrus Project’: the Apple headers declare it as ‘compatible’ with GNU ‘<span class="samp">⁠libiconv⁠</span>’ 1.11 from 2006. However, it differs in significant ways including using transliteration for conversions which cannot be represented exactly in the target encoding. (It seems this implementation is also used in recent versions of FreeBSD. Earlier versions of macOS used GNU ‘<span class="samp">⁠libiconv⁠</span>’ 1.11 and some <abbr><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></abbr> builds still do.) For a failing conversion macOS 14 generally translated character(s) to <code>?</code> but 14.1 gives an error (so an <code>NA</code> result in <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>). </p> <p>Most commercial Unixes contain an implementation of <code>iconv</code> but none we have encountered have supported the encoding names we need: the ‘R Installation and Administration’ manual recommended installing GNU ‘<span class="samp">⁠libiconv⁠</span>’ on Solaris and AIX. </p> <p>Some Linux distributions use ‘<span class="samp">⁠musl⁠</span>’ as their C runtime. This is less comprehensive than ‘<span class="samp">⁠glibc⁠</span>’: it does not support ‘<span class="samp">⁠//TRANSLIT⁠</span>’ but does inexact conversions (currently using ‘<span class="samp">⁠*⁠</span>’). </p> <p>There are other implementations, e.g. NetBSD has used one from the Citrus project (which does not support ‘<span class="samp">⁠//TRANSLIT⁠</span>’) and there is an older FreeBSD port. </p> <p>Note that you cannot rely on invalid inputs being detected, especially for <code>to = "ASCII"</code> where some implementations allow 8-bit characters and pass them through unchanged or with transliteration or substitution. </p> <p>Some of the implementations have interesting extra encodings: for example GNU ‘<span class="samp">⁠libiconv⁠</span>’ and macOS 14 allow <code>to = "C99"</code> to use ‘<span class="samp">⁠\uxxxx⁠</span>’ escapes (or if needed ‘<span class="samp">⁠\Uuxxxxxxxx⁠</span>’) for non-ASCII characters. </p> <h3>Byte Order Marks</h3> <p>most commonly known as ‘<abbr>BOM</abbr>s’. </p> <p>Encodings using character units which are more than one byte in size can be written on a file in either big-endian or little-endian order: this applies most commonly to UCS-2, UTF-16 and UTF-32/UCS-4 encodings. Some systems will write the Unicode character <code>U+FEFF</code> at the beginning of a file in these encodings and perhaps also in UTF-8. In that usage the character is known as a <abbr>BOM</abbr>, and should be handled during input (see the ‘Encodings’ section under <code><a href="connections.html">connection</a></code>: re-encoded connections have some special handling of <abbr>BOM</abbr>s). The rest of this section applies when this has not been done so <code>x</code> starts with a <abbr>BOM</abbr>. </p> <p>Implementations will generally interpret a <abbr>BOM</abbr> for <code>from</code> given as one of <code>"UCS-2"</code>, <code>"UTF-16"</code> and <code>"UTF-32"</code>. Implementations differ in how they treat <abbr>BOM</abbr>s in <code>x</code> in other <code>from</code> encodings: they may be discarded, returned as character <code>U+FEFF</code> or regarded as invalid. </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>The most portable name for the ISO 8859-15 encoding, commonly known as ‘Latin 9’, is <code>"iso885915"</code>: most platforms support both <code>"latin-9"</code> and<code>"latin9"</code> but GNU ‘<span class="samp">⁠libiconv⁠</span>’ does not support the latter. ‘<span class="samp">⁠musl⁠</span>’ (as used by Alpine Linux and other lightweight Linux distributions) supports neither, but <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> remaps there to <code>"iso885915"</code>. </p> <p>Encoding names <code>"utf8"</code>, <code>"mac"</code> and <code>"macroman"</code> are not portable. <code>"utf8"</code> is converted to <code>"UTF-8"</code> for <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> by <code>iconv</code>, but not for e.g. <code>fileEncoding</code> arguments. <code>"macintosh"</code> is the official (and most widely supported) name for ‘Mac Roman’ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman</a>). </p> <p>Using <code>sub</code> substitutes each non-convertible <em>byte</em> in the input, so when converting from UTF-8 a non-convertible character may be replaced by two or more bytes. Using <code>sub = "c99"</code> or <code>sub = "Unicode"</code> will be clearer. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="../../utils/html/localetocharset.html">localeToCharset</a></code>, <code><a href="connections.html">file</a></code>. </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">## In principle, as not all systems have iconvlist
