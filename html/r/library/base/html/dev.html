<code>dev</code>  Lists of Open/Active Graphics Devices </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>A pairlist of the names of open graphics devices is stored in <code>.Devices</code>. The name of the active device (see <code><a href="../../grdevices/html/dev.html">dev.cur</a></code>) is stored in <code>.Device</code>. Both are symbols and so appear in the base namespace. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">.Device
.Devices
</code></pre> <h3>Details</h3> <p><code>.Device</code> is a length-one character vector. </p> <p><code>.Devices</code> is a <a href="list.html">pairlist</a> of length-one character vectors. The first entry is always <code>"null device"</code>, and there are as many entries as the maximal number of graphics devices which have been simultaneously active. If a device has been removed, its entry will be <code>""</code> until the device number is reused. </p> <p>Devices may add attributes to the character vector: for example devices which write to a file may record its path in attribute <code>"filepath"</code>. </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
