<h2>
<code>setTimeLimit</code> Set CPU and/or Elapsed Time Limits</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Functions to set CPU and/or elapsed time limits for top-level computations or the current session. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
setTimeLimit(cpu = Inf, elapsed = Inf, transient = FALSE)

setSessionTimeLimit(cpu = Inf, elapsed = Inf)
</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>cpu, elapsed</code></td> <td> <p>double (of length one). Set a limit on the total or elapsed cpu time in seconds, respectively.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>transient</code></td> <td> <p>logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, the limits apply only to the rest of the current computation.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p><code>setTimeLimit</code> sets limits which apply to each top-level computation, that is a command line (including any continuation lines) entered at the console or from a file. If it is called from within a computation the limits apply to the rest of the computation and (unless <code>transient = TRUE</code>) to subsequent top-level computations. </p> <p><code>setSessionTimeLimit</code> sets limits for the rest of the session. Once a session limit is reached it is reset to <code>Inf</code>. </p> <p>Setting any limit has a small overhead – well under 1% on the systems measured. </p> <p>Time limits are checked whenever a user interrupt could occur. This will happen frequently in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> code and during <code><a href="sys.sleep.html">Sys.sleep</a></code>, but only at points in compiled C and Fortran code identified by the code author. </p> <p>‘Total cpu time’ includes that used by child processes where the latter is reported. </p><div class="_attribution">
