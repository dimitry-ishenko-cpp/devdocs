<code>Sys.glob</code> Wildcard Expansion on File Paths</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Function to do wildcard expansion (also known as ‘globbing’) on file paths. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">Sys.glob(paths, dirmark = FALSE)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="paths">paths</code></td> <td> <p>character vector of patterns for relative or absolute filepaths. Missing values will be ignored.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="dirmark">dirmark</code></td> <td> <p>logical: should matches to directories from patterns that do not already end in <code>/</code> </p> <p>have a slash appended? May not be supported on all platforms.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>This expands tilde (see <a href="path.expand.html">tilde expansion</a>) and wildcards in file paths. For precise details of wildcards expansion, see your system's documentation on the <code>glob</code> system call. There is a POSIX 1003.2 standard (see <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/glob.html">https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/glob.html</a>) but some OSes will go beyond this. </p> <p>All systems should interpret <code>*</code> (match zero or more characters), <code>?</code> (match a single character) and (probably) <code>[</code> (begin a character class or range). The handling of paths ending with a separator is system-dependent. On a POSIX-2008 compliant OS they will match directories (only), but as they are not valid filepaths on Windows, they match nothing there. (Earlier POSIX standards allowed them to match files.) </p> <p>The rest of these details are indicative (and based on the POSIX standard). </p> <p>If a filename starts with <code>.</code> this may need to be matched explicitly: for example <code>Sys.glob("*.RData")</code> may or may not match ‘<span class="file">.RData</span>’ but will not usually match ‘<span class="file">.aa.RData</span>’. Note that this is platform-dependent: e.g. on Solaris <code>Sys.glob("*.*")</code> matches ‘<span class="file">.</span>’ and ‘<span class="file">..</span>’. </p> <p><code>[</code> begins a character class. If the first character in <code>[...]</code> is not <code>!</code>, this is a character class which matches a single character against any of the characters specified. The class cannot be empty, so <code>]</code> can be included provided it is first. If the first character is <code>!</code>, the character class matches a single character which is <em>none</em> of the specified characters. Whether <code>.</code> in a character class matches a leading <code>.</code> in the filename is OS-dependent. </p> <p>Character classes can include ranges such as <code>[A-Z]</code>: include <code>-</code> as a character by having it first or last in a class. (The interpretation of ranges should be locale-specific, so the example is not a good idea in an Estonian locale.) </p> <p>One can remove the special meaning of <code>?</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>[</code> by preceding them by a backslash (except within a character class). </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>A character vector of matched file paths. The order is system-specific (but in the order of the elements of <code>paths</code>): it is normally collated in either the current locale or in byte (ASCII) order; however, on Windows collation is in the order of Unicode points. </p> <p>Directory errors are normally ignored, so the matches are to accessible file paths (but not necessarily accessible files). </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="path.expand.html">path.expand</a></code>. </p> <p><a href="quotes.html">Quotes</a> for handling backslashes in character strings. </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">
Sys.glob(file.path(R.home(), "library", "*", "R", "*.rdx"))
