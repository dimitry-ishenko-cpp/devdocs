<code>use</code> Use Packages</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Use packages in R scripts by loading their namespace and attaching a package environment including (a subset of) their exports to the search path. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">use(package, include.only)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="package">package</code></td> <td> <p>a character string given the name of a package.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="include.only">include.only</code></td> <td> <p>character vector of names of objects to include in the attached environment frame. If missing, all exports are included.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>This is a simple wrapper around <code><a href="library.html">library</a></code> which always uses <code>attach.required = FALSE</code>, so that packages listed in the <code>Depends</code> clause of the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file of the package to be used never get attached automatically to the search path. </p> <p>This therefore allows to write R scripts with full control over what gets found on the search path. In addition, such scripts can easily be integrated as package code, replacing the calls to <code>use</code> by the corresponding <code>ImportFrom</code> directives in ‘<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>’ files. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>(invisibly) a logical indicating whether the package to be used is available. </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>This functionality is still experimental: interfaces may change in future versions. </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
