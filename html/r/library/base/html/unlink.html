<h2>
<code>unlink</code> Delete Files and Directories</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p><code>unlink</code> deletes the file(s) or directories specified by <code>x</code>. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">unlink(x, recursive = FALSE, force = FALSE, expand = TRUE)</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>x</code></td> <td> <p>a character vector with the names of the file(s) or directories to be deleted.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>recursive</code></td> <td> <p>logical. Should directories be deleted recursively?</p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>force</code></td> <td> <p>logical. Should permissions be changed (if possible) to allow the file or directory to be removed?</p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>expand</code></td> <td> <p>logical. Should wildcards (see ‘Details’ below) and tilde (see <code><a href="path.expand.html">path.expand</a></code>) be expanded?</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>If <code>recursive = FALSE</code> directories are not deleted, not even empty ones. </p> <p>On most platforms ‘file’ includes symbolic links, fifos and sockets. <code>unlink(x, recursive = TRUE)</code> deletes just the symbolic link if the target of such a link is a directory. </p> <p>Wildcard expansion (normally ‘<span class="file">*</span>’ and ‘<span class="file">?</span>’ are allowed) is done by the internal code of <code><a href="sys.glob.html">Sys.glob</a></code>. Wildcards never match a leading ‘<span class="file">.</span>’ in the filename, and files ‘<span class="file">.</span>’, ‘<span class="file">..</span>’ and ‘<span class="file">~</span>’ will never be considered for deletion. Wildcards will only be expanded if the system supports it. Most systems will support not only ‘<span class="file">*</span>’ and ‘<span class="file">?</span>’ but also character classes such as ‘<span class="file">[a-z]</span>’ (see the <code>man</code> pages for the system call <code>glob</code> on your OS). The metacharacters <code>* ? [</code> can occur in Unix filenames, and this makes it difficult to use <code>unlink</code> to delete such files (see <code><a href="files.html">file.remove</a></code>), although escaping the metacharacters by backslashes usually works. If a metacharacter matches nothing it is considered as a literal character. </p> <p><code>recursive = TRUE</code> might not be supported on all platforms, when it will be ignored, with a warning: however there are no known current examples. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p><code>0</code> for success, <code>1</code> for failure, invisibly. Not deleting a non-existent file is not a failure, nor is being unable to delete a directory if <code>recursive = FALSE</code>. However, missing values in <code>x</code> are regarded as failures. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>Becker, R. A., Chambers, J. M. and Wilks, A. R. (1988) <em>The New S Language</em>.
