<code>Encoding</code> Read or Set the Declared Encodings for a Character Vector</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Read or set the declared encodings for a character vector. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">Encoding(x)

Encoding(x) &lt;- value

enc2native(x)
enc2utf8(x)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td> <td> <p>A character vector.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="value">value</code></td> <td> <p>A character vector of positive length.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>Character strings in <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> can be declared to be encoded in <code>"latin1"</code> or <code>"UTF-8"</code> or as <code>"bytes"</code>. These declarations can be read by <code>Encoding</code>, which will return a character vector of values <code>"latin1"</code>, <code>"UTF-8"</code> <code>"bytes"</code> or <code>"unknown"</code>, or set, when <code>value</code> is recycled as needed and other values are silently treated as <code>"unknown"</code>. ASCII strings will never be marked with a declared encoding, since their representation is the same in all supported encodings. Strings marked as <code>"bytes"</code> are intended to be non-ASCII strings which should be manipulated as bytes, and never converted to a character encoding (so writing them to a text file is supported only by <code>writeLines(useBytes = TRUE)</code>). </p> <p><code>enc2native</code> and <code>enc2utf8</code> convert elements of character vectors to the native encoding or UTF-8 respectively, taking any marked encoding into account. They are <a href="primitive.html">primitive</a> functions, designed to do minimal copying. </p> <p>There are other ways for character strings to acquire a declared encoding apart from explicitly setting it (and these have changed as <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> has evolved). The parser marks strings containing ‘<span class="samp">⁠\u⁠</span>’ or ‘<span class="samp">⁠\U⁠</span>’ escapes. Functions <code><a href="scan.html">scan</a></code>, <code><a href="../../utils/html/read.table.html">read.table</a></code>, <code><a href="readlines.html">readLines</a></code>, and <code><a href="parse.html">parse</a></code> have an <code>encoding</code> argument that is used to declare encodings, <code><a href="iconv.html">iconv</a></code> declares encodings from its <code>to</code> argument, and console input in suitable locales is also declared. <code><a href="utf8conversion.html">intToUtf8</a></code> declares its output as <code>"UTF-8"</code>, and output text connections (see <code><a href="textconnections.html">textConnection</a></code>) are marked if running in a suitable locale. Under some circumstances (see its help page) <code><a href="source.html">source</a>(encoding=)</code> will mark encodings of character strings it outputs. </p> <p>Most character manipulation functions will set the encoding on output strings if it was declared on the corresponding input. These include <code><a href="chartr.html">chartr</a></code>, <code><a href="strsplit.html">strsplit</a>(useBytes = FALSE)</code>, <code><a href="chartr.html">tolower</a></code> and <code><a href="chartr.html">toupper</a></code> as well as <code><a href="grep.html">sub</a>(useBytes = FALSE)</code> and <code><a href="grep.html">gsub</a>(useBytes =
  FALSE)</code>. Note that such functions do not <em>preserve</em> the encoding, but if they know the input encoding and that the string has been successfully re-encoded (to the current encoding or UTF-8), they mark the output. </p> <p><code><a href="substr.html">substr</a></code> does preserve the encoding, and <code><a href="chartr.html">chartr</a></code>, <code><a href="chartr.html">tolower</a></code> and <code><a href="chartr.html">toupper</a></code> preserve UTF-8 encoding on systems with Unicode wide characters. With their <code>fixed</code> and <code>perl</code> options, <code><a href="strsplit.html">strsplit</a></code>, <code><a href="grep.html">sub</a></code> and <code>gsub</code> will give a marked UTF-8 result if any of the inputs are UTF-8. </p> <p><code><a href="paste.html">paste</a></code> and <code><a href="sprintf.html">sprintf</a></code> return elements marked as bytes if any of the corresponding inputs is marked as bytes, and otherwise marked as UTF-8 if any of the inputs is marked as UTF-8. </p> <p><code><a href="match.html">match</a></code>, <code><a href="pmatch.html">pmatch</a></code>, <code><a href="charmatch.html">charmatch</a></code>, <code><a href="duplicated.html">duplicated</a></code> and <code><a href="unique.html">unique</a></code> all match in UTF-8 if any of the elements are marked as UTF-8. </p> <p>Changing the current encoding from a running R session may lead to confusion (see <code><a href="locales.html">Sys.setlocale</a></code>). </p> <p>There is some ambiguity as to what is meant by a ‘Latin-1’ locale, since some OSes (notably Windows) make use of character positions undefined (or used for control characters) in the ISO 8859-1 character set. How such characters are interpreted is system-dependent but as from <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> 3.5.0 they are if possible interpreted as per Windows codepage 1252 (which Microsoft calls ‘Windows Latin 1 (ANSI)’) when converting to e.g. UTF-8. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>A character vector. </p> <p>For <code>enc2utf8</code> encodings are always marked: they are for <code>enc2native</code> in UTF-8 and Latin-1 locales. </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">## x is intended to be in latin1
x. &lt;- x &lt;- "fran\xE7ais"
Encoding(x.) # "unknown" (UTF-8 loc.) | "latin1" (8859-1/CP-1252 loc.) | ....
Encoding(x) &lt;- "latin1"
x
xx &lt;- iconv(x, "latin1", "UTF-8")
Encoding(c(x., x, xx))
c(x, xx)
xb &lt;- xx; Encoding(xb) &lt;- "bytes"

stopifnot(identical(Ex, c(Encoding(x.), Encoding(x),
                          Encoding(xx), Encoding(xb))))
