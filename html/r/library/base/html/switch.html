<code>switch</code> Select One of a List of Alternatives</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p><code>switch</code> evaluates <code>EXPR</code> and accordingly chooses one of the further arguments (in <code>...</code>). </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">switch(EXPR, ...)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="EXPR">EXPR</code></td> <td> <p>an expression evaluating to a number or a character string.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="...">...</code></td> <td> <p>the list of alternatives. If it is intended that <code>EXPR</code> has a character-string value these will be named, perhaps except for one alternative to be used as a ‘default’ value.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p><code>switch</code> works in two distinct ways depending whether the first argument evaluates to a character string or a number. </p> <p>If the value of <code>EXPR</code> is not a character string it is coerced to integer. Note that this also happens for <code><a href="factor.html">factor</a></code>s, with a warning, as typically the character level is meant. If the integer is between 1 and <code>nargs()-1</code> then the corresponding element of <code>...</code> is evaluated and the result returned: thus if the first argument is <code>3</code> then the fourth argument is evaluated and returned. </p> <p>If <code>EXPR</code> evaluates to a character string then that string is matched (exactly) to the names of the elements in <code>...</code>. If there is a match then that element is evaluated unless it is missing, in which case the next non-missing element is evaluated, so for example <code>switch("cc", a = 1, cc =, cd =, d = 2)</code> evaluates to <code>2</code>. If there is more than one match, the first matching element is used. In the case of no match, if there is an unnamed element of <code>...</code> its value is returned. (If there is more than one such argument an error is signaled.) </p> <p>The first argument is always taken to be <code>EXPR</code>: if it is named its name must (partially) match. </p> <p>A warning is signaled if no alternatives are provided, as this is usually a coding error. </p> <p>This is implemented as a <a href="primitive.html">primitive</a> function that only evaluates its first argument and one other if one is selected. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>The value of one of the elements of <code>...</code>, or <code>NULL</code>, invisibly (whenever no element is selected). </p> <p>The result has the visibility (see <code><a href="invisible.html">invisible</a></code>) of the element evaluated. </p> <h3>Warning</h3> <p>It is possible to write calls to <code>switch</code> that can be confusing and may not work in the same way in earlier versions of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>. For compatibility (and clarity), always have <code>EXPR</code> as the first argument, naming it if partial matching is a possibility. For the character-string form, have a single unnamed argument as the default after the named values. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>Becker, R. A., Chambers, J. M. and Wilks, A. R.

centre &lt;- function(x, type) {
  switch(type,
         mean = mean(x),
         median = median(x),
         trimmed = mean(x, trim = .1))

# note: cat() produces no output for NULL

    cat(ch,":", switch(EXPR = ch, a = 1, b = 2:3), "\n")
for(ch in ccc)
    cat(ch,":", switch(EXPR = ch, a =, A = 1, b = 2:3, "Otherwise: last"),"\n")

## switch(f, *) with a factor f
ff &lt;- gl(3,1, labels=LETTERS[3:1])
ff[1] # C
## so one might expect " is C" here, but
switch(ff[1], A = "I am A", B="Bb..", C=" is C")# -&gt; "I am A"
## so we give a warning

## Numeric EXPR does not allow a default value to be specified
## -- it is always NULL
for(i in c(-1:3, 9))  print(switch(i, 1, 2 , 3, 4))

## visibility
switch(1, invisible(pi), pi)
switch(2, invisible(pi), pi)
