<h2>
<code>backSpline</code> Monotone Inverse Spline</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Create a monotone inverse of a monotone natural spline. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
backSpline(object)
</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>object</code></td> <td> <p>an object that inherits from class <code>nbSpline</code> or <code>npolySpline</code>. That is, the object must represent a natural interpolation spline but it can be either in the B-spline representation or the piecewise polynomial one. The spline is checked to see if it represents a monotone function. </p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Value</h3> <p>An object of class <code>polySpline</code> that contains the piecewise polynomial representation of a function that has the appropriate values and derivatives at the knot positions to be an inverse of the spline represented by <code>object</code>. Technically this object is not a spline because the second derivative is not constrained to be continuous at the knot positions. However, it is often a much better approximation to the inverse than fitting an interpolation spline to the y/x pairs. </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p>Douglas Bates and Bill Venables</p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="interpspline.html">interpSpline</a></code> </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r">
