<code>cane</code>  Sugar-cane Disease Data </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The <code>cane</code> data frame has 180 rows and 5 columns. The data frame represents a randomized block design with 45 varieties of sugar-cane and 4 blocks.</p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">cane
</code></pre> <h3>Format</h3> <p>This data frame contains the following columns: </p> <dl> <dt><code>n</code></dt>
<dd> <p>The total number of shoots in each plot. </p> </dd> <dt><code>r</code></dt>
<dd> <p>The number of diseased shoots. </p> </dd> <dt><code>x</code></dt>
<dd> <p>The number of pieces of the stems, out of 50, planted in each plot. </p> </dd> <dt><code>var</code></dt>
<dd> <p>A factor indicating the variety of sugar-cane in each plot. </p> </dd> <dt><code>block</code></dt>
<dd> <p>A factor for the blocks. </p> </dd>
</dl> <h3>Details</h3> <p>The aim of the experiment was to classify the varieties into resistant, intermediate and susceptible to a disease called "coal of sugar-cane" (carvao da cana-de-acucar). This is a disease that is common in sugar-cane plantations in certain areas of Brazil. </p> <p>For each plot, fifty pieces of sugar-cane stem were put in a solution containing the disease agent and then some were planted in the plot. After a fixed period of time, the total number of shoots and the number of diseased shoots were recorded. </p> <h3>Source</h3> <p>The data were kindly supplied by Dr. C.G.B. Demetrio of Escola Superior de Agricultura, Universidade de Sao Paolo, Brazil. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>Davison, A.C. and Hinkley, D.V. (1997) <em>Bootstrap Methods and Their Application</em>.
