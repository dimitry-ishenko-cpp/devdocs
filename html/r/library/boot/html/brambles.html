<code>brambles</code>  Spatial Location of Bramble Canes </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The <code>brambles</code> data frame has 823 rows and 3 columns. </p> <p>The location of living bramble canes in a 9m square plot was recorded. We take 9m to be the unit of distance so that the plot can be thought of as a unit square. The bramble canes were also classified by their age. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">

<dd> <p>The x coordinate of the position of the cane in the plot. </p> </dd> <dt><code>y</code></dt>
<dd> <p>The y coordinate of the position of the cane in the plot. </p> </dd> <dt><code>age</code></dt>
<dd> <p>The age classification of the canes; <code>0</code> indicates a newly emerged cane, <code>1</code> indicates a one year old cane and <code>2</code> indicates a two year old cane. </p> </dd>
