<code>calcium</code>  Calcium Uptake Data </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The <code>calcium</code> data frame has 27 rows and 2 columns. </p> <p>Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State University, conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of intracellular storage and transport of calcium across plasma membrane. Cells were suspended in a solution of radioactive calcium for a certain length of time and then the amount of radioactive calcium that was absorbed by the cells was measured. The experiment was repeated independently with 9 different times of suspension each replicated 3 times. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">calcium
</code></pre> <h3>Format</h3> <p>This data frame contains the following columns: </p> <dl> <dt><code>time</code></dt>
<dd> <p>The time (in minutes) that the cells were suspended in the solution. </p> </dd> <dt><code>cal</code></dt>
<dd> <p>The amount of calcium uptake (nmoles/mg). </p> </dd>
