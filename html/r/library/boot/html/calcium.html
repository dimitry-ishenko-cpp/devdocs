<code>calcium</code>  Calcium Uptake Data </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The <code>calcium</code> data frame has 27 rows and 2 columns. </p> <p>Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State University, conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of intracellular storage and transport of calcium across plasma membrane. Cells were suspended in a solution of radioactive calcium for a certain length of time and then the amount of radioactive calcium that was absorbed by the cells was measured. The experiment was repeated independently with 9 different times of suspension each replicated 3 times. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">

<dd> <p>The amount of calcium uptake (nmoles/mg). </p> </dd>
