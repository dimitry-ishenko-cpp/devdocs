<code>darwin</code>  Darwin's Plant Height Differences </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The <code>darwin</code> data frame has 15 rows and 1 columns. </p> <p>Charles Darwin conducted an experiment to examine the superiority of cross-fertilized plants over self-fertilized plants. 15 pairs of plants were used. Each pair consisted of one cross-fertilized plant and one self-fertilized plant which germinated at the same time and grew in the same pot. The plants were measured at a fixed time after planting and the difference in heights between the cross- and self-fertilized plants are recorded in eighths of an inch. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">darwin

<dd> <p>The difference in heights for the pairs of plants (in units of 0.125 inches). </p> </dd>
