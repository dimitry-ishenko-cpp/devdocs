<code>sunspot</code>  Annual Mean Sunspot Numbers </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p><code>sunspot</code> is a time series and contains 289 observations. </p> <p>The Zurich sunspot numbers have been analyzed in almost all books on time series analysis as well as numerous papers. The data set, usually attributed to Rudolf Wolf, consists of means of daily relative numbers of sunspot sightings. The relative number for a day is given by k(f+10g) where g is the number of sunspot groups observed, f is the total number of spots within the groups and k is a scaling factor relating the observer and telescope to a baseline. The relative numbers are then averaged to give an annual figure. See Inzenman (1983) for a discussion of the relative numbers. The figures are for the years 1700-1988. </p> <h3>Source</h3> <p>The data were obtained from </p> <p>Tong, H. (1990) <em>Nonlinear Time Series: A Dynamical System Approach</em>.
