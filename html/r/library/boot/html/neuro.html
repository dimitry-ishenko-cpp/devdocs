<code>neuro</code>  Neurophysiological Point Process Data </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p><code>neuro</code> is a matrix containing times of observed firing of a neuron in windows of 250ms either side of the application of a stimulus to a human subject. Each row of the matrix is a replication of the experiment and there were a total of 469 replicates. </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>There are a lot of missing values in the matrix as different numbers of firings were observed in different replicates. The number of firings observed varied from 2 to 6. </p> <h3>Source</h3> <p>The data were collected and kindly made available by Dr. S.J. Boniface of the Neurophysiology Unit at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>Davison, A.C. and Hinkley, D.V. (1997) <em>Bootstrap Methods and Their Application</em>.
