<code>gravity</code>  Acceleration Due to Gravity </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The <code>gravity</code> data frame has 81 rows and 2 columns. </p> <p>The <code>grav</code> data set has 26 rows and 2 columns. </p> <p>Between May 1934 and July 1935, the National Bureau of Standards in Washington D.C. conducted a series of experiments to estimate the acceleration due to gravity, <em>g</em>, at Washington. Each experiment produced a number of replicate estimates of <em>g</em> using the same methodology. Although the basic method remained the same for all experiments, that of the reversible pendulum, there were changes in configuration. </p> <p>The <code>gravity</code> data frame contains the data from all eight experiments. The <code>grav</code> data frame contains the data from the experiments 7 and 8. The data are expressed as deviations from 980.000 in centimetres per second squared. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">gravity
</code></pre> <h3>Format</h3> <p>This data frame contains the following columns: </p> <dl> <dt><code>g</code></dt>
<dd> <p>The deviation of the estimate from 980.000 centimetres per second squared. </p> </dd> <dt><code>series</code></dt>
<dd> <p>A factor describing from which experiment the estimate was derived. </p> </dd>
