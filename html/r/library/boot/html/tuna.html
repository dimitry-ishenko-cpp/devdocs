<code>tuna</code>  Tuna Sighting Data </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>The <code>tuna</code> data frame has 64 rows and 1 columns. </p> <p>The data come from an aerial line transect survey of Southern Bluefin Tuna in the Great Australian Bight. An aircraft with two spotters on board flies randomly allocated line transects. Each school of tuna sighted is counted and its perpendicular distance from the transect measured. The survey was conducted in summer when tuna tend to stay on the surface. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">tuna
</code></pre> <h3>Format</h3> <p>This data frame contains the following column: </p> <dl> <dt><code>y</code></dt>
<dd> <p>The perpendicular distance, in miles, from the transect for 64 independent sightings of tuna schools. </p> </dd>
</dl> <h3>Source</h3> <p>The data were obtained from </p> <p>Chen, S.X.
