<code>mona</code> MONothetic Analysis Clustering of Binary Variables</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Returns a list representing a divisive hierarchical clustering of a dataset with binary variables only. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">mona(x, trace.lev = 0)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="x">x</code></td> <td> <p>data matrix or data frame in which each row corresponds to an observation, and each column corresponds to a variable. All variables must be binary. A limited number of missing values (<code>NA</code>s) is allowed. Every observation must have at least one value different from <code><a href="../../base/html/na.html">NA</a></code>. No variable should have half of its values missing. There must be at least one variable which has no missing values. A variable with all its non-missing values identical is not allowed.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="trace.lev">trace.lev</code></td> <td> <p>logical or integer indicating if (and how much) the algorithm should produce progress output.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p><code>mona</code> is fully described in chapter 7 of Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990). It is “monothetic” in the sense that each division is based on a single (well-chosen) variable, whereas most other hierarchical methods (including <code>agnes</code> and <code>diana</code>) are “polythetic”, i.e. they use all variables together. </p> <p>The <code>mona</code>-algorithm constructs a hierarchy of clusterings, starting with one large cluster. Clusters are divided until all observations in the same cluster have identical values for all variables. <br> At each stage, all clusters are divided according to the values of one variable. A cluster is divided into one cluster with all observations having value 1 for that variable, and another cluster with all observations having value 0 for that variable. </p> <p>The variable used for splitting a cluster is the variable with the maximal total association to the other variables, according to the observations in the cluster to be splitted. The association between variables f and g is given by a(f,g)*d(f,g) - b(f,g)*c(f,g), where a(f,g), b(f,g), c(f,g), and d(f,g) are the numbers in the contingency table of f and g. [That is, a(f,g) (resp. d(f,g)) is the number of observations for which f and g both have value 0 (resp. value 1); b(f,g) (resp. c(f,g)) is the number of observations for which f has value 0 (resp. 1) and g has value 1 (resp. 0).] The total association of a variable f is the sum of its associations to all variables. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>an object of class <code>"mona"</code> representing the clustering. See <code><a href="mona.object.html">mona.object</a></code> for details. </p> <h3>Missing Values (<code><a href="../../base/html/na.html">NA</a></code>s)</h3> <p>The mona-algorithm requires “pure” 0-1 values. However, <code>mona(x)</code> allows <code>x</code> to contain (not too many) <code><a href="../../base/html/na.html">NA</a></code>s. In a preliminary step, these are “imputed”, i.e., all missing values are filled in. To do this, the same measure of association between variables is used as in the algorithm. When variable f has missing values, the variable g with the largest absolute association to f is looked up. When the association between f and g is positive, any missing value of f is replaced by the value of g for the same observation. If the association between f and g is negative, then any missing value of f is replaced by the value of 1-g for the same observation. </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>In <span class="pkg">cluster</span> versions before 2.0.6, the algorithm entered an infinite loop in the boundary case of one variable, i.e., <code>ncol(x) == 1</code>, which currently signals an error (because the algorithm now in C, haes not correctly taken account of this special case). </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="agnes.html">agnes</a></code> for background and references; <code><a href="mona.object.html">mona.object</a></code>, <code><a href="plot.mona.html">plot.mona</a></code>. </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">data(animals)

try( mona(ani.NA)   ) ## error: .. object with all values missing
try( mona(aniNA)    ) ## error: .. more than half missing values
try( mona(aniN2)    ) ## error: all have at least one missing
try( mona(ani.non2) ) ## error: all must be binary
try( mona(ani.idNA) ) ## error:  ditto
