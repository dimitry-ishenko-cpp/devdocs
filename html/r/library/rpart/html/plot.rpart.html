<h2>
<code>plot.rpart</code>  Plot an Rpart Object </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Plots an rpart object on the current graphics device. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
## S3 method for class 'rpart'
plot(x, uniform = FALSE, branch = 1, compress = FALSE, nspace,
     margin = 0, minbranch = 0.3, ...)
</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>x</code></td> <td> <p>a fitted object of class <code>"rpart"</code>, containing a classification, regression, or rate tree. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>uniform</code></td> <td> <p>if <code>TRUE</code>, uniform vertical spacing of the nodes is used; this may be less cluttered when fitting a large plot onto a page. The default is to use a non-uniform spacing proportional to the error in the fit. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>branch</code></td> <td> <p>controls the shape of the branches from parent to child node. Any number from 0 to 1 is allowed. A value of 1 gives square shouldered branches, a value of 0 give V shaped branches, with other values being intermediate. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>compress</code></td> <td> <p>if <code>FALSE</code>, the leaf nodes will be at the horizontal plot coordinates of <code>1:nleaves</code>. If <code>TRUE</code>, the routine attempts a more compact arrangement of the tree. The compaction algorithm assumes <code>uniform=TRUE</code>; surprisingly, the result is usually an improvement even when that is not the case. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>nspace</code></td> <td> <p>the amount of extra space between a node with children and a leaf, as compared to the minimal space between leaves. Applies to compressed trees only. The default is the value of <code>branch</code>. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>margin</code></td> <td> <p>an extra fraction of white space to leave around the borders of the tree. (Long labels sometimes get cut off by the default computation). </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>minbranch</code></td> <td> <p>set the minimum length for a branch to <code>minbranch</code> times the average branch length. This parameter is ignored if <code>uniform=TRUE</code>. Sometimes a split will give very little improvement, or even (in the classification case) no improvement at all. A tree with branch lengths strictly proportional to improvement leaves no room to squeeze in node labels. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>...</code></td> <td> <p>arguments to be passed to or from other methods. </p> </td>
</tr>
</table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>This function is a method for the generic function <code>plot</code>, for objects of class <code>rpart</code>. The y-coordinate of the top node of the tree will always be 1. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>The coordinates of the nodes are returned as a list, with components <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. </p> <h3>Side Effects</h3> <p>An unlabeled plot is produced on the current graphics device: one being opened if needed. </p> <p>In order to build up a plot in the usual S style, e.g., a separate <code>text</code> command for adding labels, some extra information about the plot needs be retained. This is kept in an environment in the package. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="rpart.html">rpart</a></code>, <code><a href="text.rpart.html">text.rpart</a></code> </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r">
