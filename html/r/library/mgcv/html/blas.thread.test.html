<h2>
<code>blas.thread.test</code> BLAS thread safety</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Most BLAS implementations are thread safe, but some versions of OpenBLAS, for example, are not. This routine is a diagnostic helper function, which you will never need if you don't set <code>nthreads&gt;1</code>, and even then are unlikely to need. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
blas.thread.test(n=1000,nt=4)
</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>n</code></td> <td> <p>Number of iterations to run of parallel BLAS calling code.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>nt</code></td> <td> <p>Number of parallel threads to use</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>While single threaded OpenBLAS 0.2.20 was thread safe, versions 0.3.0-0.3.6 are not, and from version 0.3.7 thread safety of the single threaded OpenBLAS requires making it with the option <code>USE_LOCKING=1</code>. The reference BLAS is thread safe, as are MKL and ATLAS. This routine repeatedly calls the BLAS from multi-threaded code and is sufficient to detect the problem in single threaded OpenBLAS 0.3.x. </p> <p>A multi-threaded BLAS is often no faster than a single-threaded BLAS, while judicious use of threading in the code calling the BLAS can still deliver a modest speed improvement. For this reason it is often better to use a single threaded BLAS and the codenthreads options to <code><a href="bam.html">bam</a></code> or <code><a href="gam.html">gam</a></code>. For <code>bam(...,discrete=TRUE)</code> using several threads can be a substantial benefit, especially with the reference BLAS. </p> <p>The MKL BLAS is mutlithreaded by default. Under linux setting environment variable <code>MKL_NUM_THREADS=1</code> before starting R gives single threaded operation. </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p> Simon N.
