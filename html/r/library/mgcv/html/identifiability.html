<code>identifiability</code> Identifiability constraints</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Smooth terms are generally only identifiable up to an additive constant. In consequence sum-to-zero identifiability constraints are imposed on most smooth terms. The exceptions are terms with <code>by</code> variables which cause the smooth to be identifiable without constraint (that doesn't include factor <code>by</code> variables), and random effect terms. Alternatively smooths can be set up to pass through zero at a user specified point. </p> <h3>Details</h3> <p> By default each smooth term is subject to the sum-to-zero constraint </p> <p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\sum_i f(x_i) = 0.</code> </p> <p>The constraint is imposed by reparameterization. The sum-to-zero constraint causes the term to be orthogonal to the intercept: alternative constraints lead to wider confidence bands for the constrained smooth terms. </p> <p>No constraint is used for random effect terms, since the penalty (random effect covariance matrix) anyway ensures identifiability in this case. Also if a <code>by</code> variable means that the smooth is anyway identifiable, then no extra constraint is imposed. Constraints are imposed for factor <code>by</code> variables, so that the main effect of the factor must usually be explicitly added to the model (the example below is an exception). </p> <p>Occasionally it is desirable to substitute the constraint that a particular smooth curve should pass through zero at a particular point: the <code>pc</code> argument to <code><a href="s.html">s</a></code>, <code><a href="te.html">te</a></code>, <code><a href="te.html">ti</a></code> and <code><a href="t2.html">t2</a></code> allows this: if specified then such constraints are always applied. </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p> Simon N.
