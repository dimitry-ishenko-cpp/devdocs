<code>bug.reports.mgcv</code> Reporting mgcv bugs.</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p><code>mgcv</code> works largely because many people have reported bugs over the years. If you find something that looks like a bug, please report it, so that the package can be improved. <code>mgcv</code> does not have a large development budget, so it is a big help if bug reports follow the following guidelines. </p> <p>The ideal report consists of an email to <a href="mailto:simon.wood@r-project.org.html">simon.wood@r-project.org</a> with a subject line including <code>mgcv</code> somewhere, containing </p> <ol> <li>
<p> The results of running <code><a href="../../utils/html/sessioninfo.html">sessionInfo</a></code> in the R session where the problem occurs. This provides platform details, R and package version numbers, etc. </p> </li> <li>
<p> A brief description of the problem. </p> </li> <li>
<p> Short cut and paste-able code that produces the problem, including the code for loading/generating the data (using standard R functions like <code>load</code>, <code>read.table</code> etc). </p> </li> <li>
<p> Any required data files. If you send real data it will only be used for the purposes of de-bugging. </p> </li>
</ol> <p>Of course if you have dug deeper and have an idea of what is causing the problem, that is also helpful to know, as is any suggested code fix. (Don't send a fixed package .tar.gz file, however - I can't use this). </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p> Simon N.
