<h2>
<code>toTitleCase</code> Convert Titles to Title Case</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Convert a character vector to title case, especially package titles. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
toTitleCase(text)
</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>text</code></td> <td> <p>a character vector.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>This is intended for English text only. </p> <p>No definition of‘title case’ is universally accepted: all agree that ‘principal’ words are capitalized and common words like ‘for’ are not, but not which words fall into each category. </p> <p>Generally words in all capitals are left alone: this implementation knows about conventional mixed-case words such as ‘LaTeX’ and ‘OpenBUGS’ and a few technical terms which are not usually capitalized such as ‘jar’ and ‘xls’. However, unknown technical terms will be capitalized unless they are single words enclosed in single quotes: names of packages and libraries should be quoted in titles. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>A character vector of the same length as <code>text</code>, without names. </p><div class="_attribution">
