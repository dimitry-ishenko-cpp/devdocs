<code>md5sum</code> Compute MD5 Checksums</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Compute the 32-byte MD5 hashes of one or more files. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">md5sum(files)
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="files">files</code></td> <td> <p>character. The paths of file(s) whose contents are to be hashed.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>A MD5 ‘hash’ or ‘checksum’ or ‘message digest’ is a 128-bit summary of the file contents represented by 32 hexadecimal digits. Files with different MD5 sums are different: only very exceptionally (and usually with the intent to deceive) are those with the same sums different. </p> <p>On Windows all files are read in binary mode (as the <code>md5sum</code> utilities there do): on other OSes the files are read in the default mode (almost always text mode where there is more than one). </p> <p>MD5 sums are used as a check that <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> packages have been unpacked correctly and not subsequently accidentally modified. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>A character vector of the same length as <code>files</code>, with names equal to <code>files</code> (possibly expanded). The elements will be <code>NA</code> for non-existent or unreadable files, otherwise a 32-character string of hexadecimal digits. </p> <h3>Source</h3> <p>The underlying C code was written by Ulrich Drepper and extracted from a 2001 release of <code>glibc</code>. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="checkmd5sums.html">checkMD5sums</a></code> </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">as.vector(md5sum(dir(R.home(), pattern = "^COPY", full.names = TRUE)))
