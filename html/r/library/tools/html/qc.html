<code>QC</code> QC Checks for R Code and/or Documentation</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Functions for performing various quality control (QC) checks on R code and documentation, notably on R packages. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">checkDocFiles   (package, dir, lib.loc = NULL, chkInternal = NULL)
checkDocStyle   (package, dir, lib.loc = NULL)
checkReplaceFuns(package, dir, lib.loc = NULL)
checkS3methods  (package, dir, lib.loc = NULL)
checkRdContents (package, dir, lib.loc = NULL, chkInternal = NULL)

</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="package">package</code></td> <td> <p>a character string naming an installed package.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="dir">dir</code></td> <td> <p>a character string specifying the path to a package's root source (or <em>installed</em> in some cases) directory. This should contain the subdirectories ‘<span class="file">R</span>’ (for R code) and ‘<span class="file">man</span>’ with <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> documentation sources (in Rd format). Only used if <code>package</code> is not given.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="lib.loc">lib.loc</code></td> <td> <p>a character vector of directory names of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> libraries, or <code>NULL</code>. The default value of <code>NULL</code> corresponds to all libraries currently known. The specified library trees are used to search for <code>package</code>.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="chkInternal">chkInternal</code></td> <td> <p>logical indicating if Rd files marked with keyword <code>internal</code> should be checked as well. If <code>NULL</code> (default), these are checked “specially”, ignoring missing documentation of arguments.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p><code>checkDocFiles</code> checks, for all Rd files in a package, whether all arguments shown in the usage sections of the Rd file are documented in its arguments section. It also reports duplicated entries in the arguments section, and ‘over-documented’ arguments which are given in the arguments section but not in the usage. </p> <p><code>checkDocStyle</code> investigates how (S3) methods are shown in the usages of the Rd files in a package. It reports the methods shown by their full name rather than using the Rd <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠\method⁠</code> markup for indicating S3 methods. Earlier versions of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> also reported about methods shown along with their generic, which typically caused problems for the documentation of the primary argument in the generic and its methods. With <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠\method⁠</code> now being expanded in a way that class information is preserved, joint documentation is no longer necessarily a problem. (The corresponding information is still contained in the object returned by <code>checkDocStyle</code>.) </p> <p><code>checkReplaceFuns</code> checks whether replacement functions or S3/S4 replacement methods in the package R code have their final argument named <code>value</code>. </p> <p><code>checkS3methods</code> checks whether all S3 methods defined in the package R code have all arguments of the corresponding generic, with positional arguments of the generics in the same positions for the method. As an exception, the first argument of a formula method <em>may</em> be called <code>formula</code> even if this is not the name used by the generic. The rules when <code>...</code> is involved are subtle: see the source code. Functions recognized as S3 generics are those with a call to <code>UseMethod</code> in their body, internal S3 generics (see <a href="../../base/html/internalmethods.html">InternalMethods</a>), and S3 group generics (see <code><a href="../../base/html/groupgeneric.html">Math</a></code>). Possible dispatch under a different name is not taken into account. The generics are sought first in the given package, then (if given an installed package) in the package imports, and finally the namespace environment for the <span class="pkg">base</span> package. </p> <p><code>checkRdContents()</code> checks Rd content, e.g., whether arguments of functions in the usage section have non empty descriptions. </p> <p><code>nonS3methods(package)</code> returns a <code><a href="../../base/html/character.html">character</a></code> vector with the names of the functions in <code>package</code> which ‘look’ like S3 methods, but are not. Using <code>package = NULL</code> returns all known examples. </p> <p><code>langElts</code> is a character vector of names of “language elements” of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>. These are implemented as “very primitive” functions (no argument list; <code><a href="../../base/html/print.html">print</a>()</code>ing as <code>.Primitive("<var>name</var>")</code>). </p> <p>If using an installed package, the checks needing access to all <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> objects of the package will load the package (unless it is the <span class="pkg">base</span> package), after possibly detaching an already loaded version of the package. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>The functions return objects of class the same as the respective function names containing the information about problems detected. There are <code>print</code> methods for nicely displaying the information contained in such objects. </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
