<h2>
<code>dev.flush</code>  Hold or Flush Output on an On-Screen Graphics Device. </h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>This gives a way to hold/flush output on certain on-screen devices, and is ignored by other devices. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
dev.hold(level = 1L)
dev.flush(level = 1L)
</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>level</code></td> <td> <p>Integer &gt;= 0. The amount by which to change the hold level. Negative values will be silently replaced by zero.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>Devices which implement this maintain a stack of hold levels: calling <code>dev.hold</code> increases the level and <code>dev.flush</code> decreases it. Calling <code>dev.hold</code> when the hold level is zero increases the hold level and inhibits graphics display. When calling <code>dev.flush</code> clears all pending holds the screen display is refreshed and normal operation is resumed. </p> <p>This is implemented for the cairo-based <code>X11</code> types with buffering. When the hold level is positive the ‘watch’ cursor is set on the device's window. </p> <p>It is available on the <code>quartz</code> device on macOS. </p> <p>This is implemented for the <code>windows</code> device with buffering selected (the default). When the hold level is positive the ‘busy’ cursor is set on the device's window. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>The current level after the change, invisibly. This is <code>0</code> on devices where hold levels are not supported. </p><div class="_attribution">
