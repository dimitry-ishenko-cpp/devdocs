</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>All arguments except <code>file</code> default to values given by <code><a href="pdf.options.html">pdf.options</a>()</code>. The ultimate defaults are quoted in the arguments section. </p> <p><code>pdf()</code> opens the file <code>file</code> and the PDF commands needed to plot any graphics requested are sent to that file. </p> <p>The <code>family</code> argument can be used to specify a PDF-specific font family as the initial/default font for the device. If additional font families are to be used they should be included in the <code>fonts</code> argument. </p> <p>If a device-independent <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> graphics font family is specified (e.g., via <code>par(family = )</code> in the graphics package), the PDF device makes use of the PostScript font mappings to convert the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> graphics font family to a PDF-specific font family description. (See the documentation for <code><a href="postscriptfonts.html">pdfFonts</a></code>.) </p> <p>This device does <em>not</em> embed fonts in the PDF file, so it is only straightforward to use mappings to the font families that can be assumed to be available in any PDF viewer: <code>"Times"</code> (equivalently <code>"serif"</code>), <code>"Helvetica"</code> (equivalently <code>"sans"</code>) and <code>"Courier"</code> (equivalently <code>"mono"</code>). Other families may be specified, but it is the user's responsibility to ensure that these fonts are available on the system and third-party software (e.g., Ghostscript) may be required to embed the fonts so that the PDF can be included in other documents (e.g., LaTeX): see <code><a href="embedfonts.html">embedFonts</a></code>. The URW-based families described for in section ‘Families’.can be used with viewers, platform dependently: </p> <dl> <dt>on Unix-alikes</dt>
<dd>
<p>viewers set up to use URW fonts, which is usual with those based on <code>xpdf</code> or Ghostscript.</p> </dd> <dt>on Windows</dt>
<dd>
<p>viewers such as GSView which utilise URW fonts.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>Since <code><a href="embedfonts.html">embedFonts</a></code> makes use of Ghostscript, it should be able to embed the URW-based families for use with other viewers. </p> <p>The PDF produced is fairly simple, with each page being represented as a single stream (by default compressed and possibly with references to raster images). The <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> graphics model does not distinguish graphics objects at the level of the driver interface. </p> <p>The <code>version</code> argument declares the version of PDF that gets produced. The version must be at least 1.2 when compression is used, 1.4 for semi-transparent output to be understood, and at least 1.3 if CID fonts are to be used: if any of these features are used the version number will be increased (with a warning). (PDF 1.4 was first supported by Acrobat 5 in 2001; it is very unlikely not to be supported in a current viewer.) </p> <p>Line widths as controlled by <code>par(lwd = )</code> are in multiples of 1/96 inch. Multiples less than 1 are allowed. <code>pch = "."</code> with <code>cex = 1</code> corresponds to a square of side 1/72 inch, which is also the ‘pixel’ size assumed for graphics parameters such as <code>"cra"</code>. </p> <p>The <code>paper</code> argument sets the ‘<span class="samp">⁠/MediaBox⁠</span>’ entry in the file, which defaults to <code>width</code> by <code>height</code>. If it is set to something other than <code>"special"</code>, a device region of the specified size is (by default) centred on the rectangle given by the paper size: if either <code>width</code> or <code>height</code> is less than <code>0.1</code> or too large to give a total margin of 0.5 inch, it is reset to the corresponding paper dimension minus 0.5. Thus if you want the default behaviour of <code><a href="postscript.html">postscript</a></code> use <code>pdf(paper = "a4r", width = 0, height = 0)</code> to centre the device region on a landscape A4 page with 0.25 inch margins. </p> <p>When the background colour is fully transparent (as is the initial default value), the PDF produced does not paint the background. Most PDF viewers will use a white canvas so the visual effect is if the background were white. This will not be the case when printing onto coloured paper, though. </p> <h3>File specifications</h3> <p>Tilde expansion (see <code><a href="../../base/html/path.expand.html">path.expand</a></code>) is done on the <code>file</code> argument. An input with a marked encoding is converted to the native encoding or an error is given. </p> <p>For use with <code>onefile = FALSE</code>, give a C integer format such as <code>"Rplot%03d.pdf"</code> (the default in that case) which is expanded using the page number, so this uses files ‘<span class="file">Rplot001.pdf</span>’, ..., ‘<span class="file">Rplot999.pdf</span>’, ‘<span class="file">Rplot1000.pdf</span>’, </p> <p>A single integer format matching the <a href="../../base/html/regex.html">regular expression</a> <code>"%[#0 +=-]*[0-9.]*[diouxX]"</code> is allowed in <code>file</code>. The character string should not otherwise contain a <code>%</code>: if it is really necessary, use <code>%%</code> in the string for <code>%</code> in the file path. </p> <p>For <code>pdf</code>, <code>file</code> can be <code>NULL</code> when no external file is created (effectively, no drawing occurs), but the device may still be queried (e.g., for the size of text by (base graphics) <code><a href="../../graphics/html/strwidth.html">strwidth</a></code> or (<span class="pkg">grid</span>) <code><a href="../../grid/html/stringwidth.html">stringWidth</a></code>). </p> <h3>Families</h3> <p>Font families are collections of fonts covering the five font faces, (conventionally plain, bold, italic, bold-italic and symbol) selected by the graphics parameter <code><a href="../../graphics/html/par.html">par</a>(font = )</code> or the grid parameter <code><a href="../../grid/html/gpar.html">gpar</a>(fontface = )</code>. Font families can be specified either as an initial/default font family for the device via the <code>family</code> argument or after the device is opened by the graphics parameter <code><a href="../../graphics/html/par.html">par</a>(family = )</code> or the grid parameter <code><a href="../../grid/html/gpar.html">gpar</a>(fontfamily = )</code>. Families which will be used in addition to the initial family must be specified in the <code>fonts</code> argument when the device is opened. </p> <p>Font families are declared via a call to <code><a href="postscriptfonts.html">pdfFonts</a></code> or <code><a href="postscriptfonts.html">postscriptFonts</a></code>. </p> <p>The argument <code>family</code> specifies the initial/default font family to be used. In normal use it is one of <code>"AvantGarde"</code>, <code>"Bookman"</code>, <code>"Courier"</code>, <code>"Helvetica"</code>, <code>"Helvetica-Narrow"</code>, <code>"NewCenturySchoolbook"</code>, <code>"Palatino"</code> or <code>"Times"</code>, and refers to the standard Adobe PostScript fonts families of those names which are included (or cloned) in all common PDF/PostScript renderers. </p> <p>Many PDF/PostScript renders (including those based on Ghostscript) use the URW equivalents of these fonts, which are <code>"URWGothic"</code>, <code>"URWBookman"</code>, <code>"NimbusMon"</code>, <code>"NimbusSan"</code>, <code>"NimbusSanCond"</code>, <code>"CenturySch"</code>, <code>"URWPalladio"</code> and <code>"NimbusRom"</code> respectively. If your viewer is using URW fonts, you will obtain access to more characters and more appropriate metrics by using these names. To make these easier to remember, <code>"URWHelvetica" == "NimbusSan"</code> and <code>"URWTimes" == "NimbusRom"</code> are also supported. However, if the viewer is not using URW fonts (for example Adobe Acrobat Reader) it may substitute inappropriately or not render at all. (Consider using <code><a href="embedfonts.html">embedFonts</a></code>.) </p> <p>As from <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> 4.4.0 there is support for URW 2.0 fonts in families <code>"URW2Helvetica"</code> (with ‘<span class="samp">⁠Oblique⁠</span>’ fonts), <code>"URW2HelveticaItalic"</code> (with ‘<span class="samp">⁠Italic⁠</span>’ fonts), <code>"URW2Times"</code> and <code>"NimbusMonoPS"</code>. As recent versions of Ghostscript will render with (and embed) these fonts. these families should be used instead of <code>"URWHelvetica"</code>, <code>"URWTimes"</code>, <code>"NimbusSan"</code>, <code>"NimbusRom"</code>, and <code>"NimbusMon"</code> </p> <p>Another type of family makes use of CID-keyed fonts for East Asian languages – see <code><a href="postscriptfonts.html">pdfFonts</a></code>. </p> <p>The <code>family</code> argument is normally a character string naming a font family, but family objects generated by <code><a href="type1font.html">Type1Font</a></code> and <code><a href="type1font.html">CIDFont</a></code> are also accepted. For compatibility with earlier versions of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>, the initial family can also be specified as a vector of four or five <abbr>afm</abbr> files. </p> <p>Note that <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> does not embed the font(s) used in the PostScript output: see <code><a href="embedfonts.html">embedFonts</a></code> for a utility to help do so. </p> <p>Viewers and embedding applications frequently substitute fonts for those specified in the family, and the substitute will often have slightly different font metrics. <code>useKerning = TRUE</code> spaces the letters in the string using kerning corrections for the intended family: this may look uglier than <code>useKerning = FALSE</code>. </p> <h3>Encodings</h3> <p>Encodings describe which glyphs are used to display the character codes (in the range 0–255). Most commonly <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> uses ISOLatin1 encoding, and the examples for <code><a href="../../graphics/html/text.html">text</a></code> are in that encoding. However, the encoding used on machines running <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> may well be different, and by using the <code>encoding</code> argument the glyphs can be matched to encoding in use. This suffices for European and Cyrillic languages, but not for East Asian languages. For the latter, composite CID fonts are used. These fonts are useful for other languages: for example they may contain Greek glyphs. (The rest of this section applies only when CID fonts are not used.) </p> <p>None of this will matter if only ASCII characters (codes 32–126) are used as all the encodings (except <code>"TeXtext"</code>) agree over that range. Some encodings are supersets of ISOLatin1. However, if accented and special characters do not come out as you expect, you may need to change the encoding. Some other encodings are supplied with <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>: <code>"ISOLatin2.enc"</code> (Central/Eastern Europe), <code>"ISOLatin7.enc"</code> (ISO 8859-13, ‘Baltic Rim’), <code>"ISOLatin9.enc"</code> (ISO 8859-15, including Euro), <code>"Cyrillic.enc"</code> (ISO 8859-5), <code>"KOI8-R.enc"</code>, <code>"KOI8-U.enc"</code>, and the Windows encodings <code>"WinAnsi.enc"</code> (also known as <code>"CP1252.enc"</code>, <code>"CP1250.enc"</code> (Central/Eastern Europe), <code>"CP1251.enc"</code> (Cyrillic), <code>"Greek.enc"</code> (ISO 8859-7), <code>"CP1253.enc"</code> (modern Greek) and <code>"CP1257.enc"</code> (‘Baltic Rim’). Note that many glyphs in these encodings are not in the fonts corresponding to the standard families. (The Adobe ones for all but Courier, Helvetica and Times cover little more than Latin-1, whereas the URW ones also cover Latin-2, Latin-7, Latin-9 and Cyrillic but no Greek. The Adobe exceptions cover the Latin character sets, but not the Euro.) </p> <p>NB: support for encodings other than <code>"ISOLatin1.enc"</code> (and the Windows ones on Windows) depends on support by the platform's <code>libiconv</code> in a UTF-8 locale. </p> <p>If you specify the encoding, it is your responsibility to ensure that the PostScript font contains the glyphs used. One issue here is the Euro symbol which is in several encodings (including WinAnsi and ISOLatin9 encodings) but may well not be in the PostScript fonts. (It is in the URW variants; it is not in the supplied Adobe Font Metric files so will not be centred correctly.) </p> <p>There is an exception. Character 45 (<code>"-"</code>) is always set as minus (its value in Adobe ISOLatin1) even though it is hyphen in the other encodings. Hyphen is available as character 173 (octal 0255) in all the Latin encodings, Cyrillic and Greek. (This can be entered as <code>"\u00ad"</code> in a UTF-8 locale.) There are some discrepancies in accounts of glyphs 39 and 96: the supplied encodings (except CP1250 and CP1251) treat these as ‘quoteright’ and ‘quoteleft’ (rather than ‘quotesingle’/‘acute’ and ‘grave’ respectively), as they are in the Adobe documentation. </p> <h3>Color models</h3> <p>The default color model (<code>"srgb"</code>) is <abbr>sRGB</abbr>. Model <code>"gray"</code> (or <code>"grey"</code>) maps <abbr>sRGB</abbr> colors to greyscale using perceived luminosity (biased towards green). <code>"cmyk"</code> outputs in CMYK colorspace. The simplest possible conversion from <abbr>sRGB</abbr> to CMYK is used (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model#Mapping_RGB_to_CMYK">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model#Mapping_RGB_to_CMYK</a>), and raster images are output in RGB. </p> <p>Also available for backwards compatibility is model <code>"rgb"</code> which uses uncalibrated RGB and corresponds to the model used with that name in <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> prior to 2.13.0. Some viewers may render some plots in that colorspace faster than in <abbr>sRGB</abbr>, and the plot files will be smaller. </p> <h3>Conventions</h3> <p>This section describes the implementation of the conventions for graphics devices set out in the ‘R Internals’ manual. </p> <ul> <li>
<p> The default device size is 7 inches square. </p> </li> <li>
<p> Font sizes are in big points. </p> </li> <li>
<p> The default font family is Helvetica. </p> </li> <li>
<p> Line widths are as a multiple of 1/96 inch, with a minimum of 0.01 enforced. </p> </li> <li>
<p> Circles of any radius are allowed. If <code>useDingbats =
      TRUE</code>, opaque circles of less than 10 big points radius are rendered using char 108 in the Dingbats font: all semi-transparent and larger circles using a Bézier curve for each quadrant. </p> </li> <li>
<p> Colours are by default specified as <abbr>sRGB</abbr>. </p> </li>
</ul> <p>At very small line widths, the line type may be forced to solid. </p> <h3>Printing</h3> <p>Except on Windows it is possible to print directly from <code>pdf</code> by something like (this is appropriate for a CUPS printing system): </p> <pre data-language="r">    pdf("|lp -o landscape", paper = "a4r")</pre> <p>This forces <code>onefile = TRUE</code>. </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>If you have drawn any typeset glyphs (see <code><a href="glyphinfo.html">glyphInfo</a></code>) then it is <em>highly</em> recommended that you use <code><a href="embedfonts.html">embedGlyphs</a></code> to embed the relevant fonts. </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>If you see problems with PDF output, do remember that the problem is much more likely to be in your viewer than in <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>. Try another viewer if possible. Symptoms for which the viewer has been at fault are apparent grids on image plots (turn off graphics anti-aliasing in your viewer if you can) and missing or incorrect glyphs in text (viewers silently doing font substitution). </p> <p>Unfortunately the default viewers on most Linux and macOS systems have these problems, and no obvious way to turn off graphics anti-aliasing. </p> <p>Acrobat Reader does not use the fonts specified but rather emulates them from multiple-master fonts. This can be seen in imprecise centering of characters, for example the multiply and divide signs in Helvetica. This can be circumvented by embedding fonts where possible. Most other viewers substitute fonts, e.g. URW fonts for the standard Helvetica and Times fonts, and these too often have different font metrics from the true fonts. </p> <p>Acrobat Reader can be extended by ‘font packs’, and these will be needed for the full use of encodings other than Latin-1 (although they may be offered for download as needed). </p> <dl> <dt>On some Unix-alike systems:</dt>
<dd> <p>If <code>useDingbats = TRUE</code>, the default plotting character <code>pch = 1</code> was displayed in some PDF viewers incorrectly as a <code>"q"</code> character. (These seem to be viewers based on the ‘<span class="samp">⁠poppler⁠</span>’ PDF rendering library). This may be due to incorrect or incomplete mapping of font names to those used by the system. Adding the following lines to ‘<span class="file">~/.fonts.conf</span>’ or ‘<span class="file">/etc/fonts/local.conf</span>’ may circumvent this problem, although this has largely been corrected on the affected systems. </p> <pre data-language="r">&lt;fontconfig&gt;
&lt;alias binding="same"&gt;
  &lt;family&gt;ZapfDingbats&lt;/family&gt;
  &lt;accept&gt;&lt;family&gt;Dingbats&lt;/family&gt;&lt;/accept&gt;
&lt;/alias&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
</pre> <p>Some further workarounds for problems with symbol fonts on viewers using ‘fontconfig’ are given in the ‘Cairo Fonts’ section of the help for <code><a href="x11.html">X11</a></code>. </p> </dd> <dt>On Windows:</dt>
<dd> <p>The TeXworks PDF viewer was one of those which has been seen to fail to display Dingbats (used by e.g. <code>pch = 1</code>) correctly. Whereas on other platforms the problems seen were incorrect output, on Windows points were silently omitted: however recent versions seem to manage to display Dingbats. </p> </dd> </dl> <p>There was a different font bug in the <code>pdf.js</code> viewer included in Firefox: that mapped Dingbats to the Symbol font and so displayed symbols such <code>pch = 1</code> as lambda. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="postscriptfonts.html">pdfFonts</a></code>, <code><a href="pdf.options.html">pdf.options</a></code>, <code><a href="embedfonts.html">embedFonts</a></code>, <code><a href="glyphinfo.html">glyphInfo</a></code>, <code><a href="devices.html">Devices</a></code>, <code><a href="postscript.html">postscript</a></code>. </p> <p><code><a href="cairo.html">cairo_pdf</a></code> and (on macOS only) <code><a href="quartz.html">quartz</a></code> for other devices that can produce PDF. </p> <p>More details of font families and encodings and especially handling text in a non-Latin-1 encoding and embedding fonts can be found in </p> <p> Paul Murrell and Brian Ripley (2006). “Non-standard fonts in PostScript and PDF graphics.” <em>R News</em>, <b>6</b>(2), 41–47. <a href="https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2006-2.pdf">https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2006-2.pdf</a>. </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">
