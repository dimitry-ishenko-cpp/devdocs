<code>INSTALL</code> Install Add-on Packages</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Utility for installing add-on packages.</p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
R CMD INSTALL [options] [-l lib] pkgs
</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>pkgs</code></td> <td> <p>a space-separated list with the path names of the packages to be installed. See ‘Details’.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>lib</code></td> <td> <p>the path name of the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> library tree to install to. Also accepted in the form <span class="samp">--library=lib</span>. Paths including spaces should be quoted, using the conventions for the shell in use.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>options</code></td> <td> <p>a space-separated list of options through which in particular the process for building the help files can be controlled. Use <code>R CMD INSTALL --help</code> for the full current list of options.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>This will stop at the first error, so if you want all the <code>pkgs</code> to be tried, call this via a shell loop. </p> <p>If used as <code>R CMD INSTALL pkgs</code> without explicitly specifying <code>lib</code>, packages are installed into the library tree rooted at the first directory in the library path which would be used by <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> run in the current environment. </p> <p>To install into the library tree <code><var>lib</var></code>, use <code>R CMD INSTALL -l <var>lib</var> <var>pkgs</var></code>. This prepends <code>lib</code> to the library path for duration of the install, so required packages in the installation directory will be found (and used in preference to those in other libraries). </p> <p>Both <code>lib</code> and the elements of <code>pkgs</code> may be absolute or relative path names of directories. <code>pkgs</code> may also contain names of package archive files: these are then extracted to a temporary directory. These are tarballs containing a single directory, optionally compressed by <code>gzip</code>, <code>bzip2</code>, <code>xz</code> or <code>compress</code>. Finally, binary package archive files (as created by <code>R CMD INSTALL --build</code>) can be supplied. </p> <p>Tarballs are by default unpackaged by the internal <code><a href="untar.html">untar</a></code> function: if needed an external <code>tar</code> command can be specified by the environment variable <span class="env">R_INSTALL_TAR</span>: please ensure that it can handle the type of compression used on the tarball. (This is sometimes needed for tarballs containing invalid or unsupported sections, and can be faster on very large tarballs. Setting <span class="env">R_INSTALL_TAR</span> to <span class="samp">tar.exe</span> has been needed to overcome permissions issues on some Windows systems.) </p> <p>The package sources can be cleaned up prior to installation by <span class="option">--preclean</span> or after by <span class="option">--clean</span>: cleaning is essential if the sources are to be used with more than one architecture or platform. </p> <p>Some package sources contain a ‘<span class="file">configure</span>’ script that can be passed arguments or variables via the option <span class="option">--configure-args</span> and <span class="option">--configure-vars</span>, respectively, if necessary. The latter is useful in particular if libraries or header files needed for the package are in non-system directories. In this case, one can use the configure variables <code>LIBS</code> and <code>CPPFLAGS</code> to specify these locations (and set these via <span class="option">--configure-vars</span>), see section ‘Configuration variables’ in ‘R Installation and Administration’ for more information. (If these are used more than once on the command line they are concatenated.) The configure mechanism can be bypassed using the option <span class="option">--no-configure</span>. </p> <p>If the attempt to install the package fails, leftovers are removed. If the package was already installed, the old version is restored. This happens either if a command encounters an error or if the install is interrupted from the keyboard: after cleaning up the script terminates. </p> <p>For details of the locking which is done, see the section ‘Locking’ in the help for <code><a href="install.packages.html">install.packages</a></code>. </p> <p>Option <span class="option">--build</span> can be used to tar up the installed package for distribution as a binary package (as used on macOS). This is done by <code>utils::tar</code> unless environment variable <span class="env">R_INSTALL_TAR</span> is set. </p> <p>By default a package is installed with static HTML help pages if and only if <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> was: use options <span class="option">--html</span> and <span class="option">--no-html</span> to override this. </p> <p>Packages are not by default installed keeping the source formatting (see the <code>keep.source</code> argument to <code><a href="../../base/html/source.html">source</a></code>): this can be enabled by the option <span class="option">--with-keep.source</span> or by setting environment variable <span class="env">R_KEEP_PKG_SOURCE</span> to <code>yes</code>. </p> <p>Specifying the <span class="option">--install-tests</span> option copies the contents of the ‘<span class="file">tests</span>’ directory into the package installation. If the <span class="env">R_ALWAYS_INSTALL_TESTS</span> environment variable is set to a true value, the tests will be installed even if <span class="option">--install-tests</span> is omitted. </p> <p>Use <code>R CMD INSTALL --help</code> for concise usage information, including all the available options. </p> <h3>Sub-architectures</h3> <p>An <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> installation can support more than one sub-architecture: currently this is most commonly used for 32- and 64-bit builds on Windows. </p> <p>For such installations, the default behaviour is to try to install source packages for all installed sub-architectures unless the package has a configure script or a ‘<span class="file">src/Makefile</span>’ (or ‘<span class="file">src/Makefile.win</span>’ on Windows), when only compiled code for the sub-architecture running <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> is installed. </p> <p>To install a source package with compiled code only for the sub-architecture used by <code>R CMD INSTALL</code>, use <span class="option">--no-multiarch</span>. To install just the compiled code for another sub-architecture, use <span class="option">--libs-only</span>. </p> <p>There are two ways to install for all available sub-architectures. If the configure script is known to work for both Windows architectures, use flag <span class="option">--force-biarch</span> (and packages can specify this <em>via</em> a <span class="samp">Biarch: yes</span> field in their <code>DESCRIPTION</code> files). Second, a single tarball can be installed with </p> <pre data-language="r">R CMD INSTALL --merge-multiarch mypkg_version.tar.gz</pre> <h3>Staged installation</h3> <p>The default way to install source packages changed in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.6.0, so packages are first installed to a temporary location and then (if successful) moved to the destination library directory. Some older packages were written in ways that assume direct installation to the destination library. </p> <p>Staged installation can currently be overridden by having a line <span class="samp">StagedInstall: no</span> in the package's ‘<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>’ file, <em>via</em> flag <span class="option">--no-staged-install</span> or by setting environment variable <span class="env">R_INSTALL_STAGED</span> to a false value (e.g. <span class="samp">false</span> or <span class="samp">no</span>). </p> <p>Staged installation requires either <span class="option">--pkglock</span> or <span class="option">--lock</span>, one of which is used by default. </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>The options do not have to precede <span class="samp">pkgs</span> on the command line, although it will be more legible if they do. All the options are processed before any packages, and where options have conflicting effects the last one will win. </p> <p>Some parts of the operation of <code>INSTALL</code> depend on the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> temporary directory (see <code><a href="../../base/html/tempfile.html">tempdir</a></code>, usually under ‘<span class="file">/tmp</span>’) having both write and execution access to the account running <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. This is usually the case, but if ‘<span class="file">/tmp</span>’ has been mounted as <code>noexec</code>, environment variable <span class="env">TMPDIR</span> may need to be set to a directory from which execution is allowed. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="remove.html">REMOVE</a></code>; <code><a href="../../base/html/libpaths.html">.libPaths</a></code> for information on using several library trees; <code><a href="install.packages.html">install.packages</a></code> for <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>-level installation of packages; <code><a href="update.packages.html">update.packages</a></code> for automatic update of packages using the Internet or a local repository. </p> <p>The section on ‘Add-on packages’ in ‘R Installation and Administration’ and the chapter on ‘Creating R packages’ in ‘Writing R Extensions’ <em>via</em> <code><a href="rshowdoc.html">RShowDoc</a></code> or in the ‘<span class="file">doc/manual</span>’ subdirectory of the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> source tree. </p><div class="_attribution">
