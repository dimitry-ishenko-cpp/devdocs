<code>process.events</code> Trigger Event Handling</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>R front ends like the Windows GUI handle key presses and mouse clicks through “events” generated by the OS. These are processed automatically by R at intervals during computations, but in some cases it may be desirable to trigger immediate event handling. The <code>process.events</code> function does that. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">process.events()
</code></pre> <h3>Details</h3> <p>This is a simple wrapper for the C API function <code>R_ProcessEvents</code>. As such, it is possible that it will not return if the user has signalled to interrupt the calculation. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p><code>NULL</code> is returned invisibly. </p> <h3>Author(s)</h3> <p>Duncan Murdoch </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p>See ‘Writing R Extensions’ and the ‘R for Windows FAQ’ for more discussion of the <code>R_ProcessEvents</code> function. </p> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
