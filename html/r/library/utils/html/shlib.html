<code>SHLIB</code> Build Shared Object/DLL for Dynamic Loading</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Compile the given source files and then link all specified object files into a shared object aka DLL which can be loaded into <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> using <code>dyn.load</code> or <code>library.dynam</code>. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">R CMD SHLIB [options] [-o dllname] files
</code></pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table> <tr>
<td><code id="files">files</code></td> <td> <p>a list specifying the object files to be included in the shared object/DLL. You can also include the name of source files (for which the object files are automagically made from their sources) and library linking commands. </p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="dllname">dllname</code></td> <td> <p>the full name of the shared object/DLL to be built, including the extension (typically ‘<span class="file">.so</span>’ on Unix systems, and ‘<span class="file">.dll</span>’ on Windows). If not given, the basename of the object/DLL is taken from the basename of the first file.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code id="options">options</code></td> <td> <p>Further options to control the processing. Use <code>R CMD SHLIB --help</code> for a current list. </p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p><code>R CMD SHLIB</code> is the mechanism used by <code><a href="install.html">INSTALL</a></code> to compile source code in packages. It will generate suitable compilation commands for C, C++, Objective C(++) and Fortran sources: Fortran 90/95 sources can also be used but it may not be possible to mix these with other languages (on most platforms it is possible to mix with C, but mixing with C++ rarely works). </p> <p>Please consult section ‘Creating shared objects’ in the manual ‘Writing R Extensions’ for how to customize it (for example to add <code>cpp</code> flags and to add libraries to the link step) and for details of some of its quirks. </p> <p>Items in <code>files</code> with extensions ‘<span class="file">.c</span>’, ‘<span class="file">.cpp</span>’, ‘<span class="file">.cc</span>’, ‘<span class="file">.C</span>’, ‘<span class="file">.f</span>’, ‘<span class="file">.f90</span>’, ‘<span class="file">.f95</span>’, ‘<span class="file">.m</span>’ (Objective-C), ‘<span class="file">.M</span>’ and ‘<span class="file">.mm</span>’ (Objective-C++) are regarded as source files, and those with extension ‘<span class="file">.o</span>’ as object files. All other items are passed to the linker. </p> <p>Objective C(++) support is optional when <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> was configured: their main usage is on macOS. </p> <p>Note that the appropriate run-time libraries will be used when linking if C++, Fortran or Objective C(++) sources are supplied, but not for compiled object files from these languages. </p> <p>Option <span class="option">-n</span> (also known as <span class="option">--dry-run</span>) will show the commands that would be run without actually executing them. </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>Some binary distributions of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> have <code>SHLIB</code> in a separate bundle, e.g., an <code>R-devel</code> RPM. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="compile.html">COMPILE</a></code>, <code><a href="../../base/html/dynload.html">dyn.load</a></code>, <code><a href="../../base/html/library.dynam.html">library.dynam</a></code>. </p> <p>The ‘R Installation and Administration’ and ‘Writing R Extensions’ manuals, including the section on ‘Customizing package compilation’ in the former. </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r"><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# To link against a library not on the system library paths:
R CMD SHLIB -o mylib.so a.f b.f -L/opt/acml3.5.0/gnu64/lib -lacml

## End(Not run)</code></pre> </main> </div><div class="_attribution">
