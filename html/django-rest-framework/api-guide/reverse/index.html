<h1 id="returning-urls">Returning URLs</h1> <blockquote> <p>The central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from other network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface between components.</p> <p>â€” Roy Fielding, <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a></p> </blockquote> <p>As a rule, it's probably better practice to return absolute URIs from your Web APIs, such as <code>http://example.com/foobar</code>, rather than returning relative URIs, such as <code>/foobar</code>.</p> <p>The advantages of doing so are:</p> <ul> <li>It's more explicit.</li> <li>It leaves less work for your API clients.</li> <li>There's no ambiguity about the meaning of the string when it's found in representations such as JSON that do not have a native URI type.</li> <li>It makes it easy to do things like markup HTML representations with hyperlinks.</li> </ul> <p>REST framework provides two utility functions to make it more simple to return absolute URIs from your Web API.</p> <p>There's no requirement for you to use them, but if you do then the self-describing API will be able to automatically hyperlink its output for you, which makes browsing the API much easier.</p> <h2 id="reverse">reverse</h2> <p><strong>Signature:</strong> <code>reverse(viewname, *args, **kwargs)</code></p> <p>Has the same behavior as <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/urls/#reverse"><code>django.urls.reverse</code></a>, except that it returns a fully qualified URL, using the request to determine the host and port.</p> <p>You should <strong>include the request as a keyword argument</strong> to the function, for example:</p> <pre data-language="python">from rest_framework.reverse import reverse
