<h1>Ignoring the Vary header for bots</h1> <p>Varnish supports HTTP variants out of the box, but the <em>Vary</em> header is somewhat limited since it operates on complete header values. If you want for example to conduct an A/B testing campaign or perform blue/green deployment you can make clients “remember” their path with a first-party cookie.</p> <p>When a search engine bot asks for contents however, there’s a high chance that they don’t process cookies and in all likelihood you would prefer to serve a response quickly. In that case you would probably prefer not to even try to attribute a category to the client, but in that case you create a new variant in your cache that is none of A, B, blue, green, or whatever your backend serves.</p> <p>If the way content is served makes no difference to the bot, because you changed the color of a button or something else orthogonal to the content itself, then you risk a cache miss with the detrimental effects of adding a needless variant to the cache and serving it with extra latency.</p> <p>If latency is paramount, you can use <code>req.hash_ignore_vary</code> to opt out of the Vary match during the lookup and get the freshest variant.</p> <p>Ignoring how the cookie is set, and assuming the backend always provides an accurate <em>Cache-Control</em> even when cookies are present, below is an example of an A/B testing setup where bots are served the freshest variant:</p> <pre data-language="python">import cookie;

include "devicedetect.vcl";

sub vcl_recv {
    call devicedetect;
    if (req.http.X-UA-Device ~ "bot") {
        set req.hash_ignore_vary = true;
    }
}

sub vcl_req_cookie {
    cookie.parse(req.http.Cookie);
    set req.http.X-AB-Test = cookie.get("ab-test");
    return;
}

sub vcl_deliver {
    unset resp.http.Vary;
}
</pre> <p>It is also assumed that the backend replies with a <code>Vary: X-AB-Test</code> header and varies on no other header.</p><div class="_attribution">
