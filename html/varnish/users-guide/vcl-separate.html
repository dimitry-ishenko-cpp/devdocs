<h1 id="users-guide-separate-vcl">Separate VCL files</h1> <p>Having multiple different vhosts in the same Varnish is a very typical use-case, and from Varnish 5.0 it is possible to have a separate VCL files for separate vhosts or any other distinct subset of requests.</p> <p>Assume that we want to handle <code>varnish.org</code> with one VCL file and <code>varnish-cache.org</code> with another VCL file.</p> <p>First load the two VCL files:</p> <pre data-language="python">vcl.load vo_1 /somewhere/vo.vcl
vcl.load vc_1 /somewhere/vc.vcl
</pre> <p>These are 100% normal VCL files, as they would look if you ran only that single domain on your Varnish instance.</p> <p>Next we need to point VCL labels to them:</p> <pre data-language="python">vcl.label l_vo vo_1
vcl.label l_vc vc_1
</pre> <p>Next we write the top-level VCL program, which branches out to the other two, depending on the Host: header in the request:</p> <pre data-language="python">import std;

# We have to have a backend, even if we do not use it
backend default { .host = "127.0.0.1"; }

sub vcl_recv {
    # Normalize host header
    set req.http.host = std.tolower(req.http.host);

    if (req.http.host ~ "\.?varnish\.org$") {
        return (vcl(l_vo));
    }
    if (req.http.host ~ "\.?varnish-cache\.org$") {
        return (vcl(l_vc));
    }
    return (synth(302, "http://varnish-cache.org"));
}

sub vcl_synth {
    if (resp.status == 301 || resp.status == 302) {
        set resp.http.location = resp.reason;
        set resp.reason = "Moved";
        return (deliver);
    }
}
</pre> <p>Finally, we load the top level VCL and make it the active VCL:</p> <pre data-language="python">vcl.load top_1 /somewhere/top.vcl
vcl.use top_1
</pre> <p>If you want to update one of the separated VCLs, you load the new one and change the label to point to it:</p> <pre data-language="python">vcl.load vo_2 /somewhere/vo.vcl
vcl.label l_vo vo_2
</pre> <p>If you want to change the top level VCL, do as you always did:</p> <pre data-language="python">vcl.load top_2 /somewhere/top.vcl
vcl.use top_2
</pre> <section id="details-details-details"> <h2>Details, details, details:</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>All requests <em>always</em> start in the active VCL - the one from <code>vcl.use</code>
</li> <li>Only VCL labels can be used in <code>return(vcl(name))</code>. Without this restriction the top level VCL would have to be reloaded every time one of the separate VCLs were changed.</li> <li>You can only switch VCLs from the active VCL. If you try it from one of the separate VCLs, you will get a 503</li> <li>You cannot remove VCL labels (with <code>vcl.discard</code>) if any VCL contains <code>return(vcl(name_of_that_label))</code>
</li> <li>You cannot remove VCLs which have a label attached to them.</li> <li>This code is tested in testcase c00077</li> <li>This is a very new feature, it may change</li> <li>We would very much like feedback how this works for you</li> </ul> </section><div class="_attribution">
