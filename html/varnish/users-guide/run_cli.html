<h1 id="run-cli">CLI - bossing Varnish around</h1> <p>Once <code>varnishd</code> is started, you can control it using the <code>varnishadm</code> program and the command line interface:</p> <pre data-language="python">varnishadm help
</pre> <p>If you want to run <code>varnishadm</code> from a remote system, we recommend you use <code>ssh</code> into the system where <code>varnishd</code> runs. (But see also: <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/cli_protocol.html#ref-remote-cli"><span class="std std-ref">Local and remote CLI connections</span></a>)</p> <p>You can SSH into the <code>varnishd</code> computer and run <code>varnishadm</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">ssh $hostname varnishadm help
</pre> <p>If you give no command arguments, <code>varnishadm</code> runs in interactive mode with command-completion, command-history and other comforts:</p> <pre data-language="text">critter phk&gt; ./varnishadm

varnish-trunk revision 2bd5d2adfc407216ebaa653fae882d3c8d47f5e1

Type 'help' for command list.
Type 'quit' to close CLI session.
Type 'start' to launch worker process.

</pre> <p>The CLI always returns a three digit status code to tell how things went.</p> <p>200 and 201 means <em>OK</em>, anything else means that some kind of trouble prevented the execution of the command.</p> <p>(If you get 201, it means that the output was truncated, See the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishd.html#ref-param-cli-limit"><span class="std std-ref">cli_limit</span></a> parameter.)</p> <p>When commands are given as arguments to <code>varnishadm</code>, a status different than 200 or 201 will cause it to exit with status 1 and print the status code on standard error.</p> <section id="what-can-you-do-with-the-cli"> <h2>What can you do with the CLI</h2> <p>From the CLI you can:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>load/use/discard VCL programs</li> <li>ban (invalidate) cache content</li> <li>change parameters</li> <li>start/stop worker process</li> </ul> <p>We will discuss each of these briefly below.</p> <section id="load-use-and-discard-vcl-programs"> <h3>Load, use and discard VCL programs</h3> <p>All caching and policy decisions are made by VCL programs.</p> <p>You can have multiple VCL programs loaded, but one of them is designated the “active” VCL program, and this is where all new requests start out.</p> <p>To load new VCL program:</p> <pre data-language="python">varnish&gt; vcl.load some_name some_filename
</pre> <p>Loading will read the VCL program from the file, and compile it. If the compilation fails, you will get an error messages:</p> <pre data-language="text">.../mask is not numeric.

----------------#################-

Running VCC-compiler failed, exit 1
VCL compilation failed
</pre> <p>If compilation succeeds, the VCL program is loaded, and you can now make it the active VCL, whenever you feel like it:</p> <pre data-language="python">varnish&gt; vcl.use some_name
</pre> <p>If you find out that was a really bad idea, you can switch back to the previous VCL program again:</p> <pre data-language="python">varnish&gt; vcl.use old_name
</pre> <p>The switch is instantaneous, all new requests will start using the VCL you activated right away. The requests currently being processed complete using whatever VCL they started with.</p> <p>We highly recommend you design an emergency-VCL, and always keep it loaded, so it can be activated with</p> <pre data-language="python">vcl.use emergency
</pre> </section> <section id="ban-cache-content"> <h3>Ban cache content</h3> <p>Varnish offers “purges” to remove things from cache, but that requires you to know exactly what they are.</p> <p>Sometimes it is useful to be able to throw things out of cache without having an exact list of what to throw out.</p> <p>Imagine for instance that the company logo changed and now you need Varnish to stop serving the old logo out of the cache:</p> <pre data-language="text">varnish&gt; ban req.url ~ "logo.*[.]png"
</pre> <p>should do that, and yes, that is a regular expression.</p> <p>We call this “banning” because the objects are still in the cache, but they are now banned from delivery, while all the rest of the cache is unaffected.</p> <p>Even when you want to throw out <em>all</em> the cached content, banning is both faster and less disruptive that a restart:</p> <pre data-language="python">varnish&gt; ban obj.http.date ~ .*
</pre> </section> <section id="change-parameters"> <h3>Change parameters</h3> <p>Parameters can be set on the command line with the ‘-p’ argument, but almost all parameters can be examined and changed on the fly from the CLI:</p> <pre data-language="text">varnish&gt; param.show prefer_ipv6
200
prefer_ipv6         off [bool]
                    Default is off
                    Prefer IPv6 address when connecting to backends
                    which have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

varnish&gt; param.set prefer_ipv6 true
200
</pre> <p>In general it is not a good idea to modify parameters unless you have a good reason, such as performance tuning or security configuration.</p> <p>Most parameters will take effect instantly, or with a short delay, but a few of them requires you to restart the child process before they take effect. This is always mentioned in the description of the parameter.</p> </section> <section id="starting-and-stopping-the-worker-process"> <h3>Starting and stopping the worker process</h3> <p>In general you should just leave the worker process running, but if you need to stop and/or start it, the obvious commands work:</p> <pre data-language="python">varnish&gt; stop
</pre> <p>and:</p> <pre data-language="python">varnish&gt; start
</pre> <p>If you start <code>varnishd</code> with the ‘-d’ (debugging) argument, you will always need to start the child process explicitly.</p> <p>Should the child process die, the master process will automatically restart it, but you can disable that with the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishd.html#ref-param-auto-restart"><span class="std std-ref">auto_restart</span></a> parameter.</p> </section> </section><div class="_attribution">
