<h1>Hashing</h1> <p>Internally, when Varnish stores content in the cache indexed by a hash key used to find the object again. In the default setup this key is calculated based on <code>URL</code>, the <code>Host:</code> header, or if there is none, the IP address of the server:</p> <pre data-language="python">sub vcl_hash {
    hash_data(req.url);
    if (req.http.host) {
        hash_data(req.http.host);
    } else {
        hash_data(server.ip);
    }
    return (lookup);
}
</pre> <p>As you can see it first hashes <code>req.url</code> and then <code>req.http.host</code> if it exists. It is worth pointing out that Varnish doesn’t lowercase the hostname or the URL before hashing it so in theory having “Varnish.org/” and “varnish.org/” would result in different cache entries. Browsers however, tend to lowercase hostnames.</p> <p>You can change what goes into the hash. This way you can make Varnish serve up different content to different clients based on arbitrary criteria.</p> <p>Let’s say you want to serve pages in different languages to your users based on where their IP address is located. You would need some Vmod to get a country code and then put it into the hash. It might look like this.</p> <p>In <code>vcl_recv</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">set req.http.X-Country-Code = geoip.lookup(client.ip);
</pre> <p>And then add a <code>vcl_hash</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">sub vcl_hash {
    hash_data(req.http.X-Country-Code);
}
</pre> <p>Because there is no <code>return(lookup)</code>, the builtin VCL will take care of adding the URL, <code>Host:</code> or server IP# to the hash as usual.</p> <p>If <code>vcl_hash</code> did return, ie:</p> <pre data-language="python">sub vcl_hash {
    hash_data(req.http.X-Country-Code);
    return(lookup);
}
</pre> <p>then <em>only</em> the country-code would matter, and Varnish would return seemingly random objects, ignoring the URL, (but they would always have the correct <code>X-Country-Code</code>).</p><div class="_attribution">
