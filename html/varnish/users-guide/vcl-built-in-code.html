<h1 id="vcl-built-in-code">Built-in VCL</h1> <p>Whenever a VCL program is loaded, the built-in VCL is appended to it. The vcl built-in subs (<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/vcl-step.html#id7"><span class="std std-ref">VCL Steps</span></a>) have a special property, they can appear multiple times and the result is concatenation of all built-in subroutines.</p> <p>For example, let’s take the following snippet:</p> <pre data-language="python">sub vcl_recv {
    # loaded code for vcl_recv
}
</pre> <p>The effective VCL that is supplied to the compiler looks like:</p> <pre data-language="python">sub vcl_recv {
    # loaded code for vcl_recv
    # built-in code for vcl_recv
}
</pre> <p>This is how it is guaranteed that all <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/states.html#reference-states"><span class="std std-ref">Varnish Processing States</span></a> have at least one <code>return (&lt;action&gt;)</code>.</p> <p>It is generally recommended not to invariably return from loaded code to let Varnish execute the built-in code, because the built-in code provides essentially a sensible default behavior for an HTTP cache.</p> <section id="built-in-subroutines-split"> <h2>Built-in subroutines split</h2> <p>It might however not always be practical that the built-in VCL rules take effect at the very end of a state, so some subroutines like <code>vcl_recv</code> are split into multiple calls to other subroutines.</p> <p>By convention, those assistant subroutines are named after the variable they operate on, like <code>req</code> or <code>beresp</code>. This allows for instance to circumvent default behavior.</p> <p>For example, <code>vcl_recv</code> in the built-in VCL prevents caching when clients have a cookie. If you can trust your backend to always specify whether a response is cacheable or not regardless of whether the request contained a cookie you can do this:</p> <pre data-language="python">sub vcl_req_cookie {
    return;
}
</pre> <p>With this, all other default behaviors from the built-in <code>vcl_recv</code> are executed and only cookie handling is affected.</p> <p>Another example is how the built-in <code>vcl_backend_response</code> treats a negative TTL as a signal not to cache. It’s a historical mechanism to mark a response as uncacheable, but only if the built-in <code>vcl_backend_response</code> is not circumvented by a <code>return (&lt;action&gt;)</code>.</p> <p>However, in a multi-tier architecture where a backend might be another Varnish server, you might want to cache stale responses to allow the delivery of graced objects and enable revalidation on the next fetch. This can be done with the following snippet:</p> <pre data-language="python">sub vcl_beresp_stale {
    if (beresp.ttl + beresp.grace &gt; 0s) {
        return;
    }
}
</pre> <p>This granularity, and the general goal of the built-in subroutines split is to allow to circumvent a specific aspect of the default rules without giving the entire logic up.</p> </section> <section id="built-in-vcl-reference"> <h2>Built-in VCL reference</h2> <p>A copy of the <code>builtin.vcl</code> file might be provided with your Varnish installation but <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishd.html#varnishd-1"><span class="std std-ref">varnishd</span></a> is the reference to determine the code that is appended to any loaded VCL.</p> <p>The VCL compilation happens in two passes:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>the first one compiles the built-in VCL only,</li> <li>and the second pass compiles the concatenation of the loaded and built-in VCLs.</li> </ul> <p>Any VCL subroutine present in the built-in VCL can be extended, in which case the loaded VCL code will be executed before the built-in code.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
