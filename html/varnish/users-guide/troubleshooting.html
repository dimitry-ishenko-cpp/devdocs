<h1 id="users-trouble">Troubleshooting Varnish</h1> <p>Sometimes Varnish misbehaves or rather behaves the way you told it to behave but not necessarily the way you want it to behave. In order for you to understand whats going on there are a couple of places you can check. <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishlog.html#varnishlog-1"><span class="std std-ref">varnishlog</span></a>, <code>/var/log/syslog</code>, <code>/var/log/messages</code> are all good places where Varnish might leave clues of whats going on. This section will guide you through basic troubleshooting in Varnish.</p> <section id="when-varnish-won-t-start"> <h2>When Varnish won’t start</h2> <p>Sometimes Varnish wont start. There is a plethora of possible reasons why Varnish wont start on your machine. We’ve seen everything from wrong permissions on <code>/dev/null</code> to other processes blocking the ports.</p> <p>Starting Varnish in debug mode to see what is going on.</p> <p>Try to start Varnish with the same arguments as otherwise, but <code>-d</code> added. This will give you some more information on what is going on. Let us see how Varnish will react when something else is listening on its port.:</p> <pre data-language="python"># varnishd -n foo -f /usr/local/etc/varnish/default.vcl -s malloc,1G -T 127.0.0.1:2000  -a 0.0.0.0:8080 -d
storage_malloc: max size 1024 MB.
Using old SHMFILE
Platform: Linux,2.6.32-21-generic,i686,-smalloc,-hcritbit
200 193
-----------------------------
Varnish Cache CLI.
-----------------------------
Type 'help' for command list.
Type 'quit' to close CLI session.
Type 'start' to launch worker process.
</pre> <p>Now Varnish is running but only the master process is running, in debug mode the cache does not start. Now you’re on the console. You can instruct the master process to start the cache by issuing “start”.:</p> <pre data-language="python">start
bind(): Address already in use
300 22
Could not open sockets
</pre> <p>And here we have our problem. Something else is bound to the HTTP port of Varnish. If this doesn’t help try <code>strace</code> or <code>truss</code> or come find us on IRC.</p> </section> <section id="varnish-is-crashing-panics"> <h2>Varnish is crashing - panics</h2> <p>When Varnish goes bust the child processes crashes. Most of the crashes are caught by one of the many consistency checks we have included in the Varnish source code. When Varnish hits one of these the caching process will crash itself in a controlled manner, leaving a nice stack trace with the mother process.</p> <p>You can inspect any panic messages by typing <code>panic.show</code> in the CLI.:</p> <pre data-language="python">panic.show
Last panic at: Tue, 15 Mar 2011 13:09:05 GMT

</pre> <p>The crash might be due to misconfiguration or a bug. If you suspect it is a bug you can use the output in a bug report, see the “Trouble Tickets” section in the Introduction chapter above.</p> </section> <section id="varnish-is-crashing-stack-overflows"> <h2>Varnish is crashing - stack overflows</h2> <p>Bugs put aside, the most likely cause of crashes are stack overflows, which is why we have added a heuristic to add a note when a crash looks like it was caused by one. In this case, the panic message contains something like this:</p> <pre data-language="python">Signal 11 (Segmentation fault) received at 0x7f631f1b2f98 si_code 1
THIS PROBABLY IS A STACK OVERFLOW - check thread_pool_stack parameter
</pre> <p>as a first measure, please follow this advise and check if crashes still occur when you add 128k to whatever the value of the <code>thread_pool_stack</code> parameter and restart varnish.</p> <p>If varnish stops crashing with a larger <code>thread_pool_stack</code> parameter, it’s not a bug (at least most likely).</p> </section> <section id="varnish-is-crashing-segfaults"> <h2>Varnish is crashing - segfaults</h2> <p>Sometimes a bug escapes the consistency checks and Varnish gets hit with a segmentation error. When this happens with the child process it is logged, the core is dumped and the child process starts up again.</p> <p>A core dumped is usually due to a bug in Varnish. However, in order to debug a segfault the developers need you to provide a fair bit of data.</p>  <ul> <li>Make sure you have Varnish installed with debugging symbols.</li> <li>Check where your operating system writes core files and ensure that you actually get them. For example on linux, learn about <code>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</code> from the <code>core(5)</code> manpage.</li> <li>
<p>Make sure core dumps are allowed in the parent shell from which varnishd is being started. In shell, this would be:</p> <pre data-language="python">ulimit -c unlimited
</pre> <p>but if varnish is started from an init-script, that would need to be adjusted or in the case of systemd, <code>LimitCORE=infinity</code> set in the service’s <code>[Service]]</code> section of the unit file.</p> </li> </ul>  <p>Once you have the core, <code>cd</code> into varnish’s working directory (as given by the <code>-n</code> parameter, whose default is <code>$PREFIX/var/varnish/$HOSTNAME</code> with <code>$PREFIX</code> being the installation prefix, usually <code>/usr/local</code>, open the core with <code>gdb</code> and issue the command <code>bt</code> to get a stack trace of the thread that caused the segfault.</p> <p>A basic debug session for varnish installed under <code>/usr/local</code> could look like this:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ cd /usr/local/var/varnish/`uname -n`/

</pre> </section> <section id="varnish-gives-me-guru-meditation"> <h2>Varnish gives me Guru meditation</h2> <p>First find the relevant log entries in <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishlog.html#varnishlog-1"><span class="std std-ref">varnishlog</span></a>. That will probably give you a clue. Since <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishlog.html#varnishlog-1"><span class="std std-ref">varnishlog</span></a> logs a lot of data it might be hard to track the entries down. You can set <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishlog.html#varnishlog-1"><span class="std std-ref">varnishlog</span></a> to log all your 503 errors by issuing the following command:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ varnishlog -q 'RespStatus == 503' -g request
</pre> <p>If the error happened just a short time ago the transaction might still be in the shared memory log segment. To get <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishlog.html#varnishlog-1"><span class="std std-ref">varnishlog</span></a> to process the whole shared memory log just add the ‘-d’ parameter:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ varnishlog -d -q 'RespStatus == 503' -g request
