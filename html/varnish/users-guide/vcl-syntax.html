<h1>VCL Syntax</h1> <p>VCL has inherited a lot from C and it reads much like simple C or Perl.</p> <p>Blocks are delimited by curly brackets, statements end with semicolons, and comments may be written as in C, C++ or Perl according to your own preferences.</p> <p>Note that VCL doesn’t contain any loops or jump statements.</p> <p>This section provides an outline of the more important parts of the syntax. For a full documentation of VCL syntax please see <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/vcl.html#vcl-7"><span class="std std-ref">VCL</span></a> in the reference.</p> <section id="strings"> <h2>Strings</h2> <p>Basic strings are enclosed in “ … “, and may not contain newlines.</p> <p>Backslash is not special, so for instance in <code>regsub()</code> you do not need to do the “count-the-backslashes” polka:</p> <pre data-language="python">regsub("barf", "(b)(a)(r)(f)", "\4\3\2p") -&gt; "frap"
</pre> <p>Long strings are enclosed in {” … “} or “”” … “””. They may contain any character including “, newline and other control characters except for the NUL (0x00) character. If you really want NUL characters in a string there is a VMOD that makes it possible to create such strings.</p> </section> <section id="access-control-lists-acls"> <h2 id="vcl-syntax-acl">Access control lists (ACLs)</h2> <p>An ACL declaration creates and initializes a named access control list which can later be used to match client addresses:</p> <pre data-language="python">acl local {
  "localhost";         // myself
  "192.0.2.0"/24;      // and everyone on the local network
  ! "192.0.2.23";      // except for the dialin router
}
</pre> <p>If an ACL entry specifies a host name which Varnish is unable to resolve, it will match any address it is compared to. Consequently, if it is preceded by a negation mark, it will reject any address it is compared to, which may not be what you intended. If the entry is enclosed in parentheses, however, it will simply be ignored.</p> <p>To match an IP address against an ACL, simply use the match operator:</p> <pre data-language="python">if (client.ip ~ local) {
  return (pipe);
}
</pre> <p>In Varnish versions before 7.0, ACLs would always emit a <code>VCL_acl</code> record in the VSL log, from 7.0 and forward, this must be explicitly enabled by specifying the <code>+log</code> flag:</p> <pre data-language="python">acl local +log {
  "localhost";         // myself
  "192.0.2.0"/24;      // and everyone on the local network
  ! "192.0.2.23";      // except for the dialin router
}
</pre> </section> <section id="operators"> <h2>Operators</h2> <p>The following operators are available in VCL. See the examples further down for, uhm, examples.</p> <dl class="simple"> <dt>=</dt>
<dd>
<p>Assignment operator.</p> </dd> </dl> <dl class="simple"> <dt>==</dt>
<dd>
<p>Comparison.</p> </dd> </dl> <dl class="simple"> <dt>~</dt>
<dd>
<p>Match. Can either be used with regular expressions or ACLs.</p> </dd> </dl> <dl class="simple"> <dt>!</dt>
<dd>
<p>Negation.</p> </dd> </dl> <dl class="simple"> <dt>&amp;&amp;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Logical <em>and</em></p> </dd> </dl> <dl class="simple"> <dt>||</dt>
<dd>
<p>Logical <em>or</em></p> </dd> </dl> </section> <section id="built-in-subroutines"> <h2>Built in subroutines</h2> <p>Varnish has quite a few built-in subroutines that are called for each transaction as it flows through Varnish. These built-in subroutines are all named <code>vcl_*</code> and are explained in <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/vcl-step.html#id7"><span class="std std-ref">VCL Steps</span></a>.</p> <p>Processing in built-in subroutines ends with <code>return (&lt;action&gt;)</code> (see <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/vcl-step.html#vcl-actions"><span class="std std-ref">VCL Actions</span></a>).</p> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="vcl-built-in-code.html#vcl-built-in-code"><span class="std std-ref">Built-in VCL</span></a> also contains custom assistant subroutines called by the built-in subroutines, also prefixed with <code>vcl_</code>.</p> </section> <section id="custom-subroutines"> <h2>Custom subroutines</h2> <p>You can write your own subroutines, whose names cannot start with <code>vcl_</code>.</p> <p>A subroutine is typically used to group code for legibility or reusability:</p> <pre data-language="python">sub pipe_if_local {
  if (client.ip ~ local) {
    return (pipe);
  }
}
</pre> <p>To call a subroutine, use the <code>call</code> keyword followed by the subroutine’s name:</p> <pre data-language="python">call pipe_if_local;
</pre> <p>Custom subroutines in VCL do not take arguments, nor do they return values.</p> <p><code>return (&lt;action&gt;)</code> (see <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/vcl-step.html#vcl-actions"><span class="std std-ref">VCL Actions</span></a>) as shown in the example above returns all the way from the top level built in subroutine (see <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/vcl-step.html#id7"><span class="std std-ref">VCL Steps</span></a>) which, possibly through multiple steps, lead to the call of the custom subroutine.</p> <p><code>return</code> without an action resumes execution after the <code>call</code> statement of the calling subroutine.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
