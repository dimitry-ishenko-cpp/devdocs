<h1 id="users-guide-backend-servers">Backend servers</h1> <p>Varnish has a concept of “backend” or “origin” servers. A backend server is the server providing the content Varnish will accelerate.</p> <p>Our first task is to tell Varnish where it can find its backends. Start your favorite text editor and open the relevant VCL file.</p> <p>Somewhere in the top there will be a section that looks a bit like this.:</p> <pre data-language="python"># backend default {
#     .host = "127.0.0.1";
#     .port = "8080";
# }
</pre> <p>We remove the comment markings in this text stanza making the it look like.:</p> <pre data-language="python">backend default {
    .host = "127.0.0.1";
    .port = "8080";
}
</pre> <p>Now, this piece of configuration defines a backend in Varnish called <em>default</em>. When Varnish needs to get content from this backend it will connect to port 8080 on localhost (127.0.0.1).</p> <p>Varnish can have several backends defined you can even join several backends together into clusters of backends for load balancing purposes.</p><div class="_attribution">
