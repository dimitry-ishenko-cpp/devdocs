<h1 id="users-guide-logging">Logging in Varnish</h1> <p>One of the really nice features in Varnish is the way logging works. Instead of logging to a normal log file Varnish logs to a shared memory segment, called the VSL - the Varnish Shared Log. When the end of the segment is reached we start over, overwriting old data.</p> <p>This is much, much faster than logging to a file and it doesn’t require disk space. Besides it gives you much, much more information when you need it.</p> <p>The flip side is that if you forget to have a program actually write the logs to disk they will be overwritten.</p> <p><code>varnishlog</code> is one of the programs you can use to look at what Varnish is logging. <code>varnishlog</code> gives you the raw logs, everything that is written to the logs. There are other clients that can access the logs as well, we’ll show you these later.</p> <p>In the terminal window you started Varnish now type <code>varnishlog -g raw</code> and press enter.</p> <p>You’ll see lines like these scrolling slowly by.:</p> <pre data-language="python">0 CLI            - Rd ping
0 CLI            - Wr 200 19 PONG 1273698726 1.0
</pre> <p>These is the Varnish master process checking up on the caching process to see that everything is OK.</p> <p>Now go to the browser and reload the page displaying your web app.</p> <p>You’ll see lines like these.:</p> <pre data-language="python">11 SessOpen       c 127.0.0.1 58912 :8080 0.0.0.0 8080 1273698726.933590 14
11 ReqStart       c 127.0.0.1 58912
11 ReqMethod      c GET
11 ReqURL         c /
11 ReqProtocol    c HTTP/1.1
11 ReqHeader      c Host: localhost:8080
11 ReqHeader      c Connection: keep-alive
</pre> <p>The first column is an arbitrary number, it identifies the transaction. Lines with the same number are coming from the same transaction. The second column is the <em>tag</em> of the log message. All log entries are tagged with a tag indicating what sort of activity is being logged.</p> <p>The third column tell us whether this is is data coming from or going to the client (‘c’), or the backend (‘b’). The forth column is the data being logged.</p> <p>Now, you can filter quite a bit with <code>varnishlog</code>. The basic options we think you want to know are:</p> <dl class="simple"> <dt>‘-b’</dt>
<dd>
<p>Only show log lines from traffic going between Varnish and the backend servers. This will be useful when we want to optimize cache hit rates.</p> </dd> <dt>‘-c’</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as ‘-b’ but for client side traffic.</p> </dd> <dt>‘-g request’</dt>
<dd>
<p>Group transactions by request.</p> </dd> <dt>‘-q query’</dt>
<dd>
<p>Only list transactions matching this query.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>For more information on this topic please see <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishlog.html#varnishlog-1"><span class="std std-ref">varnishlog</span></a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
