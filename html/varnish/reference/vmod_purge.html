<a class="reference internal" href="#purge-soft"><span class="std std-ref">INT soft(DURATION ttl, DURATION grace, DURATION keep)</span></a></pre> </section> <section id="description"> <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> <p><em>vmod_purge</em> contains functions that offer a finer-grained control than <code>return(purge)</code> from <code>vcl_recv{}</code>. The functions can only be called from <code>vcl_hit{}</code> or <code>vcl_miss{}</code> and they should in general be used in both to ensure that all variants of a same object are taken care of.</p> </section> <section id="example"> <h2>EXAMPLE</h2> <pre data-language="python">sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        if (client.ip !~ purge_acl) {
            return (synth(405));
        }
        return (hash);
    }

</pre> <section id="int-hard"> <h3 id="purge-hard">INT hard()</h3> <p>This is equivalent to <code>return(purge)</code> but explicitly called from <code>vcl_hit{}</code> and <code>vcl_miss{}</code>. It returns the number of purged objects.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="python">set req.http.purged = purge.hard();
</pre> <p>Restricted to: <code>vcl_hit</code>, <code>vcl_miss</code>.</p> </section> <section id="int-soft-duration-ttl-duration-grace-duration-keep"> <h3 id="purge-soft">INT soft(DURATION ttl, DURATION grace, DURATION keep)</h3> <pre data-language="python">INT soft(DURATION ttl=0, DURATION grace=-1, DURATION keep=-1)
</pre> <p>Sets the <em>ttl</em>, <em>grace</em> and <em>keep</em>.</p> <p>By default, <em>ttl</em> is set to 0 with <em>grace</em> and <em>keep</em> periods left untouched. Setting a negative value for <em>grace</em> or <em>keep</em> periods leaves them untouched. Setting all three parameters to <code>0</code> is equivalent to a hard purge. It returns the number of soft-purged objects.</p> <p>Restricted to: <code>vcl_hit</code>, <code>vcl_miss</code>.</p> </section> </section> <section id="see-also"> <h2>SEE ALSO</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li><a class="reference internal" href="vcl.html#vcl-7"><span class="std std-ref">VCL</span></a></li> </ul> </section> <section id="copyright"> <h2>COPYRIGHT</h2> <pre data-language="python">Copyright (c) 2017 Varnish Software AS
