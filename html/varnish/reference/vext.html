<h1 id="ref-vext">VEXT - Varnish Extensions</h1> <p>A Varnish Extension is a shared library, loaded into the worker process during startup, before privilges are dropped for good. This allows a VEXT to do pretty much anything it wants to do in the worker process.</p> <p>A VEXT can (also) contain a VMOD, and it will work just like any other VMOD, which also means that VMODs can be loaded as VEXTs.</p> <p>The VEXTs are loaded in the child process, in the order they are specified on the commandline, after the <code>heritage</code> has been established, but before stevedores are initialized and jail privileges are dropped.</p> <p>There is currently no <code>init</code> entrypoint defined, but a VEXT can use a static initializer to get activated on loading.</p> <p>If those static initializers want to bail out, <code>stderr</code> and <code>exit(3)</code> can be used to convey diagnostics.</p><div class="_attribution">
