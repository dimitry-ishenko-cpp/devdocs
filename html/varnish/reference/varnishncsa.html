The Request transaction is then scanned for the relevant parts in order to output one log line. To filter the log lines produced, use the query language to select the applicable transactions. Non-request transactions are ignored.</p> <p>The following options are available:</p> <dl class="option-list"> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-a</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>When writing output to a file, append to it rather than overwrite it. This option has no effect without the -w option.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-b</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Log backend requests. If -c is not specified, then only backend requests will trigger log lines.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-c</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Log client requests. This is the default. If -b is specified, then -c is needed to also log client requests</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-C</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Do all regular expression and string matching caseless.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-d</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Process log records at the head of the log and exit.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-D</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Daemonize.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-E</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Show ESI requests, implies client mode.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-F <var>&lt;format&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Set the output log format string.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-f <var>&lt;formatfile&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Read output format from a file. Will read a single line from the specified file, and use that line as the format.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-g <var>&lt;request|vxid&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>The grouping of the log records. The default is to group by vxid.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-h</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Print program usage and exit</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-j</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Make format-specifier replacements JSON-compatible. When escaping characters, use JSON-style \uXXXX escape sequences instead of C-style \xXX sequences. Empty strings will be replaced with “” instead of “-”, and empty integers will be replaced with null. Use -F or -f in combination with -j to write JSON logs.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-k <var>&lt;num&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Process this number of matching log transactions before exiting.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-L <var>&lt;limit&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Sets the upper limit of incomplete transactions kept before the oldest transaction is force completed. A warning record is synthesized when this happens. This setting keeps an upper bound on the memory usage of running queries. Defaults to 1000 transactions.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-n <var>&lt;dir&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Specify the varnishd working directory (also known as instance name) to get logs from. If -n is not specified, the host name is used.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-P <var>&lt;file&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Write the process’ PID to the specified file.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-Q <var>&lt;file&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Specifies the file containing the VSL query to use. When multiple -Q or -q options are specified, all queries are considered as if the ‘or’ operator was used to combine them.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-q <var>&lt;query&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Specifies the VSL query to use. When multiple -q or -Q options are specified, all queries are considered as if the ‘or’ operator was used to combine them.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-r <var>&lt;filename&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Read log in binary file format from this file. The file can be created with <code>varnishlog -w filename</code>. If the filename is -, logs are read from the standard input. and cannot work as a daemon.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-R <var>&lt;limit[/duration]&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Restrict the output to the specified limit. Transactions exceeding the limit will be suppressed. The limit is specified as the maximum number of transactions (with respect to the chosen grouping method) and an optional time period. If no duration is specified, a default of <code>s</code> is used. The duration field can be formatted as in VCL (e.g. <code>-R 10/2m</code>) or as a simple time period without the prefix (e.g. <code>-R 5/m</code>). When in <code>-g raw</code> grouping mode, this setting can not be used alongside <code>-i</code>, <code>-I</code>, <code>-x</code> or <code>-X</code>, and we advise using <code>-q</code> instead.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-t <var>&lt;seconds|off&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Timeout before returning error on initial VSM connection. If set the VSM connection is retried every 0.5 seconds for this many seconds. If zero the connection is attempted only once and will fail immediately if unsuccessful. If set to “off”, the connection will not fail, allowing the utility to start and wait indefinetely for the Varnish instance to appear. Defaults to 5 seconds.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-V</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Print version information and exit.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">-w <var>&lt;filename&gt;</var></span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Redirect output to file. The file will be overwritten unless the -a option was specified. If the application receives a SIGHUP in daemon mode the file will be reopened allowing the old one to be rotated away. This option is required when running in daemon mode. If the filename is -, varnishncsa writes to the standard output and cannot work as a daemon.</p> </dd> <dt><kbd><span class="option">--optstring</span></kbd></dt> <dd>
<p>Print the optstring parameter to <code>getopt(3)</code> to help writing wrapper scripts.</p> </dd> </dl> </section> <section id="modes"> <h3>MODES</h3> <p>The default mode of varnishncsa is “client mode”. In this mode, the log will be similar to what a web server would produce in the absence of varnish. Client mode can be explicitly selected by using -c.</p> <p>If the -b switch is specified, varnishncsa will operate in “backend mode”. In this mode, requests generated by varnish to the backends will be logged. Unless -c is also specified, client requests received by varnish will be ignored.</p> <p>When running varnishncsa in both backend and client mode, it is strongly advised to include the format specifier %{Varnish:side}x to distinguish between backend and client requests.</p> <p>Client requests that results in a pipe (ie. return(pipe) in vcl), will not generate logging in backend mode. This is because varnish is not generating requests, but blindly passes on bytes in both directions. However, a varnishncsa instance running in normal mode can see this case by using the formatter %{Varnish:handling}x, which will be ‘pipe’.</p> <p>In backend mode, some of the fields in the format string get different meanings. Most notably, the byte counting formatters (%b, %I, %O) considers varnish to be the client.</p> <p>It is possible to keep two varnishncsa instances running, one in backend mode, and one in client mode, logging to different files.</p> </section> <section id="format"> <h3 id="ncsa-format">FORMAT</h3> <p>Specify the log format to use. If no format is specified the default log format is used:</p> <pre data-language="python">%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b "%{Referer}i" "%{User-agent}i"
</pre> <p>Escape sequences \n and \t are supported.</p> <p>Supported formatters are:</p> <dl> <dt>%b</dt>

<dd>
<p>In client mode, time taken to serve the request, in microseconds. In backend mode, time from the request was sent to the entire body had been received. This is equivalent to %{us}T.</p> </dd> <dt>%H</dt>

<code>%{msec}</code>: number of milliseconds since the Epoch</li> <li>
<code>%{usec}</code>: number of milliseconds since the Epoch</li> <li>
<code>%{msec_frac}</code>: millisecond fraction</li> <li>

<dd>
<p>In client mode, one of the ‘hit’, ‘miss’, ‘pass’, ‘pipe’ or ‘synth’ strings indicating how the request was handled. In backend mode, this field is blank.</p> </dd> <dt>Varnish:side</dt>
<dd>
<p>Backend or client side. One of two values, ‘b’ or ‘c’, depending on where the request was made. In pure backend or client mode, this field will be constant.</p> </dd> <dt>Varnish:vxid</dt>
<dd>

<dd>
<p>The value set by std.log(“key:value”) in VCL.</p> </dd> <dt>VSL:tag:record-prefix[field]</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value of the VSL entry for the given tag-record prefix-field combination. Tag is mandatory, the other components are optional.</p> <p>The record prefix will limit the matches to those records that have this prefix as the first part of the record content followed by a colon.</p> <p>The field will, if present, treat the log record as a white space separated list of fields, and only the nth part of the record will be matched against. Fields start counting at 1 and run up to 255.</p> <p>Defaults to ‘-’ when the tag is not seen, the record prefix does not match or the field is out of bounds. If a tag appears multiple times in a single transaction, the first occurrence is used.</p> </dd> </dl> </dd> </dl> </section> <section id="signals"> <h3>SIGNALS</h3> <ul> <li>
