<h1 id="tutorial-starting-varnish">Starting Varnish</h1> <p>This tutorial will assume that you are running Varnish on Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS. Those of you running on other platforms might have to do some mental translation exercises in order to follow this. Since you’re on a “weird” platform you’re probably used to it. :-)</p> <p>Make sure you have Varnish successfully installed (following one of the procedures described in “Installing Varnish” above.</p> <p>When properly installed you start Varnish with <code>service varnish start</code>. This will start Varnish if it isn’t already running.</p> <p>Now you have Varnish running. Let us make sure that it works properly. Use your browser to go to <a class="reference external" href="http://127.0.0.1:6081/">http://127.0.0.1:6081/</a> (Replace the IP address with the IP for the machine that runs Varnish) The default configuration will try to forward requests to a web application running on the same machine as Varnish was installed on. Varnish expects the web application to be exposed over http on port 8080.</p> <p>If there is no web application being served up on that location Varnish will issue an error. Varnish Cache is very conservative about telling the world what is wrong so whenever something is amiss it will issue the same generic “Error 503 Service Unavailable”.</p> <p>You might have a web application running on some other port or some other machine. Let’s edit the configuration and make it point to something that actually works.</p> <p>Fire up your favorite editor and edit <code>/etc/varnish/default.vcl</code>. Most of it is commented out but there is some text that is not. It will probably look like this:</p> <pre data-language="python">vcl 4.0;

backend default {
    .host = "127.0.0.1";
    .port = "8080";
}
</pre> <p>We’ll change it and make it point to something that works. Hopefully <a class="reference external" href="http://www.varnish-cache.org/">http://www.varnish-cache.org/</a> is up. Let’s use that. Replace the text with:</p> <pre data-language="python">vcl 4.0;

backend default {
    .host = "www.varnish-cache.org";
    .port = "80";
}
</pre> <p>Now issue <code>service varnish reload</code> to make Varnish reload it’s configuration. If that succeeded visit <a class="reference external" href="http://127.0.0.1:6081/">http://127.0.0.1:6081/</a> in your browser and you should see some directory listing. It works! The reason you’re not seeing the Varnish official website is because your client isn’t sending the appropriate <code>Host</code> header in the request and it ends up showing a listing of the default webfolder on the machine usually serving up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.varnish-cache.org/">http://www.varnish-cache.org/</a> .</p><div class="_attribution">
