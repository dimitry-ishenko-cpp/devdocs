<h1>Peculiarities</h1> <p>There are a couple of things that are different with Varnish Cache, as opposed to other programs. One thing you’ve already seen - VCL. In this section we provide a very quick tour of other peculiarities you need to know about to get the most out of Varnish.</p> <section id="configuration"> <h2>Configuration</h2> <p>The Varnish Configuration is written in VCL. When Varnish is ran this configuration is transformed into C code and then fed into a C compiler, loaded and executed.</p> <p>So, as opposed to switching various settings on or off, you write polices on how the incoming traffic should be handled.</p> </section> <section id="varnishadm"> <h2>varnishadm</h2> <p>Varnish Cache has an admin console. You can connect it through the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishadm.html#varnishadm-1"><span class="std std-ref">varnishadm</span></a> command. In order to connect the user needs to be able to read <code>/etc/varnish/secret</code> in order to authenticate.</p> <p>Once you’ve started the console you can do quite a few operations on Varnish, like stopping and starting the cache process, load VCL, adjust the built in load balancer and invalidate cached content.</p> <p>It has a built in command “help” which will give you some hints on what it does.</p> </section> <section id="varnishlog"> <h2>varnishlog</h2> <p>Varnish does not log to disk. Instead it logs to a chunk of memory. It is actually streaming the logs. At any time you’ll be able to connect to the stream and see what is going on. Varnish logs quite a bit of information. You can have a look at the logstream with the command <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/varnishlog.html#varnishlog-1"><span class="std std-ref">varnishlog</span></a>.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
