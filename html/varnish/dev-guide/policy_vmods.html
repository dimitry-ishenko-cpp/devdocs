<h1 id="policy-vmods">Bundling VMODs with the Varnish distribution</h1> <p>Decisions about whether to add a new Varnish module (VMOD) to those bundled with Varnish are guided by these criteria.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The VMOD is known to be in widespread use and in high demand for common use cases.</li> <li>Or, if the VMOD is relatively new, it provides compelling features that the developer group agrees will be a valuable enhancement for the project.</li> <li>
<p>The VMOD does not create dependencies on additional external libraries. VMODs that are “glue” for a library come from third parties.</p> <ul> <li>We don’t want to add new burdens of dependency and compatibility to the project.</li> <li>We don’t want to force Varnish deployments to install more than admins explicitly choose to install.</li> </ul> </li> <li>
<p>The VMOD code follows project conventions (passes make distcheck, follows source code style, and so forth).</p> <ul> <li>A pull request can demonstrate that this is the case (after any necessary fixups).</li> </ul> </li> <li>The developer group commits to maintaining the code for the long run (so there will have to be a consensus that we’re comfortable with it).</li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
