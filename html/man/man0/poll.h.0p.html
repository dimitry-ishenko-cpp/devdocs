<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

       poll.h — definitions for the poll() function
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;poll.h&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>&lt;poll.h&gt;</i> header shall define the <b>pollfd </b>structure, which
       shall include at least the following members:

           int    fd       The following descriptor being polled.
           short  events   The input event flags (see below).
           short  revents  The output event flags (see below).

       The <i>&lt;poll.h&gt;</i> header shall define the following type through
       <b>typedef</b>:

       <b>nfds_t        </b>An unsigned integer type used for the number of
                     file descriptors.

       The implementation shall support one or more programming
       environments in which the width of <b>nfds_t </b>is no greater than the
       width of type <b>long</b>.  The names of these programming environments
       can be obtained using the <i>confstr</i>() function or the <i>getconf</i>
       utility.

       The <i>&lt;poll.h&gt;</i> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants, zero or more of which may be OR'ed together to form
       the <i>events</i> or <i>revents</i> members in the <b>pollfd </b>structure:

       POLLIN        Data other than high-priority data may be read
                     without blocking.

       POLLRDNORM    Normal data may be read without blocking.

       POLLRDBAND    Priority data may be read without blocking.

       POLLPRI       High priority data may be read without blocking.

       POLLOUT       Normal data may be written without blocking.

       POLLWRNORM    Equivalent to POLLOUT.

       POLLWRBAND    Priority data may be written.

       POLLERR       An error has occurred (<i>revents</i> only).

       POLLHUP       Device has been disconnected (<i>revents</i> only).

       POLLNVAL      Invalid <i>fd</i> member (<i>revents</i> only).

       The significance and semantics of normal, priority, and high-
       priority data are file and device-specific.

       The following shall be declared as a function and may also be
       defined as a macro. A function prototype shall be provided.

           int   poll(struct pollfd [], nfds_t, int);
