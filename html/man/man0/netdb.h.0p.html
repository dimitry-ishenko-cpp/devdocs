       shall include at least the following members:

           int               ai_flags      Input flags.

           struct addrinfo  *ai_next       Pointer to next in list.

       The <i>&lt;netdb.h&gt;</i> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants that evaluate to bitwise-distinct integer constants for
       use in the <i>flags</i> field of the <b>addrinfo </b>structure:

       AI_PASSIVE    Socket address is intended for <i>bind</i>().

       AI_CANONNAME  Request for canonical name.

       AI_NUMERICHOST
                     Return numeric host address as name.

       AI_NUMERICSERV
                     Inhibit service name resolution.

       AI_V4MAPPED   If no IPv6 addresses are found, query for IPv4
                     addresses and return them to the caller as
                     IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

       AI_ALL        Query for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

       AI_ADDRCONFIG Query for IPv4 addresses only when an IPv4 address
                     is configured; query for IPv6 addresses only when
                     an IPv6 address is configured.

       The <i>&lt;netdb.h&gt;</i> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants that evaluate to bitwise-distinct integer constants for
       use in the <i>flags</i> argument to <i>getnameinfo</i>():

       NI_NOFQDN     Only the nodename portion of the FQDN is returned
                     for local hosts.

       NI_NUMERICHOST
                     The numeric form of the node's address is returned
                     instead of its name.

       NI_NAMEREQD   Return an error if the node's name cannot be
                     located in the database.

       NI_NUMERICSERV
                     The numeric form of the service address is returned
                     instead of its name.

       NI_NUMERICSCOPE
                     For IPv6 addresses, the numeric form of the scope
                     identifier is returned instead of its name.

       NI_DGRAM      Indicates that the service is a datagram service
                     (SOCK_DGRAM).

   <b>Address Information Errors</b>
       The <i>&lt;netdb.h&gt;</i> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants for use as error values for <i>getaddrinfo</i>() and
       <i>getnameinfo</i>().  The values shall be suitable for use in <b>#if</b>
       preprocessing directives.

       EAI_AGAIN     The name could not be resolved at this time. Future
                     attempts may succeed.

       EAI_BADFLAGS  The flags had an invalid value.

       EAI_FAIL      A non-recoverable error occurred.

       EAI_FAMILY    The address family was not recognized or the
                     address length was invalid for the specified
                     family.

       EAI_MEMORY    There was a memory allocation failure.

       EAI_NONAME    The name does not resolve for the supplied
                     parameters.

                     NI_NAMEREQD is set and the host's name cannot be
                     located, or both <i>nodename</i> and <i>servname</i> were null.

       EAI_SERVICE   The service passed was not recognized for the
                     specified socket type.

       EAI_SOCKTYPE  The intended socket type was not recognized.

       EAI_SYSTEM    A system error occurred. The error code can be
                     found in <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.

       EAI_OVERFLOW  An argument buffer overflowed.

       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be
       defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.

           void              setprotoent(int);
           void              setservent(int);

       The <i>&lt;netdb.h&gt;</i> header shall define the <b>socklen_t </b>type through
       <b>typedef</b>, as described in <i>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</i>.

       Inclusion of the <i>&lt;netdb.h&gt;</i> header may also make visible all
       symbols from <i>&lt;netinet/in.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</i>, and <i>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</i>.
