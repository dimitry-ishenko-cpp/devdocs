PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       assert.h — verify program assertion
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;assert.h&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>&lt;assert.h&gt;</i> header shall define the <i>assert</i>() macro. It refers
       to the macro NDEBUG which is not defined in the header. If NDEBUG
       is defined as a macro name before the inclusion of this header,
       the <i>assert</i>() macro shall be defined simply as:

           #define assert(ignore)((void) 0)

       Otherwise, the macro behaves as described in <i>assert</i>().

       The <i>assert</i>() macro shall be redefined according to the current
       state of NDEBUG each time <i>&lt;assert.h&gt;</i> is included.

       The <i>assert</i>() macro shall be implemented as a macro, not as a
       function. If the macro definition is suppressed in order to
       access an actual function, the behavior is undefined.
