DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>&lt;iso646.h&gt;</i> header shall define the following eleven macros
       (on the left) that expand to the corresponding tokens (on the
       right):

       and       &amp;&amp;

       and_eq    &amp;=

       bitand    &amp;

       bitor     |

       compl     ~

       not       !

       not_eq    !=

       or        ||
