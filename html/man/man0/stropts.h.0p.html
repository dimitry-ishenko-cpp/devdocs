       I_CKBAND    See if any messages exist in a band.

       I_FDINSERT  Send implementation-defined information about another

                   by the <i>arg</i> argument.

       The <i>&lt;stropts.h&gt;</i> header shall define at least the following
       symbolic constants for use with I_FLUSH:

       FLUSHR      Flush read queues.

       FLUSHRW     Flush read and write queues.

       The <i>&lt;stropts.h&gt;</i> header shall define at least the following
       symbolic constants for use with I_SETSIG:

       S_BANDURG   When used in conjunction with S_RDBAND, SIGURG is
                   generated instead of SIGPOLL when a priority message
                   reaches the front of the STREAM head read queue.

       S_ERROR     Notification of an error condition reaches the STREAM
                   head.

       S_HANGUP    Notification of a hangup reaches the STREAM head.

       S_HIPRI     A high-priority message is present on a STREAM head
                   read queue.

       S_INPUT     A message, other than a high-priority message, has
                   arrived at the head of a STREAM head read queue.

       S_MSG       A STREAMS signal message that contains the SIGPOLL
                   signal reaches the front of the STREAM head read
                   queue.

       S_OUTPUT    The write queue for normal data (priority band 0)
                   just below the STREAM head is no longer full. This
                   notifies the process that there is room on the queue
                   for sending (or writing) normal data downstream.

       S_RDBAND    A message with a non-zero priority band has arrived
                   at the head of a STREAM head read queue.

       S_RDNORM    A normal (priority band set to 0) message has arrived
                   at the head of a STREAM head read queue.

       S_WRBAND    The write queue for a non-zero priority band just
                   below the STREAM head is no longer full.

       S_WRNORM    Equivalent to S_OUTPUT.

       The <i>&lt;stropts.h&gt;</i> header shall define at least the following
       symbolic constant for use with I_PEEK:

       RS_HIPRI    Only look for high-priority messages.

       The <i>&lt;stropts.h&gt;</i> header shall define at least the following
       symbolic constants for use with I_SRDOPT:

       RMSGD       Message-discard mode.

       RMSGN       Message-non-discard mode.

       RNORM       Byte-STREAM mode, the default.

       RPROTDAT    Deliver the control part of a message as data when a
                   process issues a <i>read</i>().

       RPROTDIS    Discard the control part of a message, delivering any
                   data part, when a process issues a <i>read</i>().

       RPROTNORM   Fail <i>read</i>() with <b>[EBADMSG] </b>if a message containing a
                   control part is at the front of the STREAM head read
                   queue.

       The <i>&lt;stropts.h&gt;</i> header shall define at least the following
       symbolic constant for use with I_SWOPT:

       SNDZERO     Send a zero-length message downstream when a <i>write</i>()
                   of 0 bytes occurs.

       The <i>&lt;stropts.h&gt;</i> header shall define at least the following
       symbolic constants for use with I_ATMARK:

       ANYMARK     Check if the message is marked.

       LASTMARK    Check if the message is the last one marked on the
                   queue.

       The <i>&lt;stropts.h&gt;</i> header shall define at least the following
       symbolic constant for use with I_UNLINK:

       MUXID_ALL   Unlink all STREAMs linked to the STREAM associated
                   with <i>fildes</i>.

       The <i>&lt;stropts.h&gt;</i> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants for <i>getmsg</i>(), <i>getpmsg</i>(), <i>putmsg</i>(), and <i>putpmsg</i>():

       MORECTL     More control information is left in message.

       MOREDATA    More data is left in message.

       MSG_ANY     Receive any message.

       MSG_BAND    Receive message from specified band.

       MSG_HIPRI   Send/receive high-priority message.

       The <i>&lt;stropts.h&gt;</i> header may make visible all of the symbols from
       <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i>.

       The <i>&lt;stropts.h&gt;</i> header may also define macros for message types
       using names that start with <i>M_</i>.

       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be
       defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.

           int    fattach(int, const char *);
           int    fdetach(const char *);
           int    getmsg(int, struct strbuf *restrict, struct strbuf *restrict,
                      int *restrict);
           int    getpmsg(int, struct strbuf *restrict, struct strbuf *restrict,
                      int *restrict, int *restrict);
           int    ioctl(int, int, ...);
           int    isastream(int);
           int    putmsg(int, const struct strbuf *, const struct strbuf *, int);
           int    putpmsg(int, const struct strbuf *, const struct strbuf *, int,
                      int);
