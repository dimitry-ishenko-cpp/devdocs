SYNOPSIS </h2>

       #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Some of the functionality described on this reference page
       extends the ISO C standard. Applications shall define the
       appropriate feature test macro (see the System Interfaces volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.2</i>, <i>The Compilation Environment</i>) to
       enable the visibility of these symbols in this header.

       The <i>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</i> header shall declare sets of integer types having
       specified widths, and shall define corresponding sets of macros.
       It shall also define macros that specify limits of integer types
       corresponding to types defined in other standard headers.

       <b>Note:  </b>The ``width'' of an integer type is the number of bits
              used to store its value in a pure binary system; the
              actual type may use more bits than that (for example, a
              28-bit type could be stored in 32 bits of actual storage).
              An <i>N</i>-bit signed type has values in the range -2<i>N</i>-1 or
              1-2<i>N</i>-1 to 2<i>N</i>-1-1, while an <i>N</i>-bit unsigned type has values
              in the range 0 to 2<i>N</i>-1.

       Types are defined in the following categories:

        *  Integer types having certain exact widths

        *  Integer types having at least certain specified widths

        *  Fastest integer types having at least certain specified
           widths

        *  Integer types wide enough to hold pointers to objects

        *  Integer types having greatest width

       (Some of these types may denote the same type.)

       Corresponding macros specify limits of the declared types and
       construct suitable constants.

       For each type described herein that the implementation provides,
       the <i>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</i> header shall declare that <b>typedef </b>name and define
       the associated macros. Conversely, for each type described herein
       that the implementation does not provide, the <i>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</i> header
       shall not declare that <b>typedef </b>name, nor shall it define the
       associated macros. An implementation shall provide those types
       described as required, but need not provide any of the others
       (described as optional).

   <b>Integer Types</b>
       When <b>typedef </b>names differing only in the absence or presence of
       the initial <i>u</i> are defined, they shall denote corresponding signed
       and unsigned types as described in the ISO/IEC 9899:1999
       standard, Section 6.2.5; an implementation providing one of these
       corresponding types shall also provide the other.

       In the following descriptions, the symbol <i>N</i> represents an
       unsigned decimal integer with no leading zeros (for example, 8 or
       24, but not 04 or 048).

        *  Exact-width integer types

           The <b>typedef </b>name <b>int</b><i>N</i><b>_t </b>designates a signed integer type with
           width <i>N</i>, no padding bits, and a two's-complement
           representation. Thus, <b>int8_t </b>denotes a signed integer type
           with a width of exactly 8 bits.

           The <b>typedef </b>name <b>uint</b><i>N</i><b>_t </b>designates an unsigned integer type
           with width <i>N</i>.  Thus, <b>uint24_t </b>denotes an unsigned integer
           type with a width of exactly 24 bits.

           The following types are required:

           <b>int8_t</b>
           <b>int16_t</b>
           <b>int32_t</b>
           <b>uint8_t</b>
           <b>uint16_t</b>
           <b>uint32_t</b>

           If an implementation provides integer types with width 64
           that meet these requirements, then the following types are
           required: <b>int64_t uint64_t</b>

           In particular, this will be the case if any of the following
           are true:

           --  The implementation supports the _POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG
               programming environment and the application is being
               built in the _POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG programming
               environment (see the Shell and Utilities volume of
               POSIX.1‐2017, <i>c99</i>, Programming Environments).

           --  The implementation supports the _POSIX_V7_LP64_OFF64
               programming environment and the application is being
               built in the _POSIX_V7_LP64_OFF64 programming
               environment.

           --  The implementation supports the _POSIX_V7_LPBIG_OFFBIG
               programming environment and the application is being
               built in the _POSIX_V7_LPBIG_OFFBIG programming
               environment.

           All other types of this form are optional.

        *  Minimum-width integer types

           The <b>typedef </b>name <b>int_least</b><i>N</i><b>_t </b>designates a signed integer
           type with a width of at least <i>N</i>, such that no signed integer
           type with lesser size has at least the specified width. Thus,
           <b>int_least32_t </b>denotes a signed integer type with a width of
           at least 32 bits.

           The <b>typedef </b>name <b>uint_least</b><i>N</i><b>_t </b>designates an unsigned integer
           type with a width of at least <i>N</i>, such that no unsigned
           integer type with lesser size has at least the specified
           width. Thus, <b>uint_least16_t </b>denotes an unsigned integer type
           with a width of at least 16 bits.

           The following types are required: <b>int_least8_t int_least16_t</b>
           <b>int_least32_t int_least64_t uint_least8_t uint_least16_t</b>
           <b>uint_least32_t uint_least64_t</b>

           All other types of this form are optional.

        *  Fastest minimum-width integer types

           Each of the following types designates an integer type that
           is usually fastest to operate with among all integer types
           that have at least the specified width.

           The designated type is not guaranteed to be fastest for all
           purposes; if the implementation has no clear grounds for
           choosing one type over another, it will simply pick some
           integer type satisfying the signedness and width
           requirements.

           The <b>typedef </b>name <b>int_fast</b><i>N</i><b>_t </b>designates the fastest signed
           integer type with a width of at least <i>N</i>.  The <b>typedef </b>name
           <b>uint_fast</b><i>N</i><b>_t </b>designates the fastest unsigned integer type
           with a width of at least <i>N</i>.

           The following types are required: <b>int_fast8_t int_fast16_t</b>
           <b>int_fast32_t int_fast64_t uint_fast8_t uint_fast16_t</b>
           <b>uint_fast32_t uint_fast64_t</b>

           All other types of this form are optional.

        *  Integer types capable of holding object pointers

           The following type designates a signed integer type with the
           property that any valid pointer to <b>void </b>can be converted to
           this type, then converted back to a pointer to <b>void</b>, and the
           result will compare equal to the original pointer: <b>intptr_t</b>

           The following type designates an unsigned integer type with
           the property that any valid pointer to <b>void </b>can be converted
           to this type, then converted back to a pointer to <b>void</b>, and
           the result will compare equal to the original pointer:
           <b>uintptr_t</b>

           On XSI-conformant systems, the <b>intptr_t </b>and <b>uintptr_t </b>types
           are required; otherwise, they are optional.

        *  Greatest-width integer types

           The following type designates a signed integer type capable
           of representing any value of any signed integer type:
           <b>intmax_t</b>

           The following type designates an unsigned integer type
           capable of representing any value of any unsigned integer
           type: <b>uintmax_t</b>

           These types are required.

       <b>Note:</b>
           Applications can test for optional types by using the
           corresponding limit macro from <i>Limits of Specified-Width</i>
           <i>Integer Types</i>.

   <b>Limits of Specified-Width Integer Types</b>
       The following macros specify the minimum and maximum limits of
       the types declared in the <i>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</i> header. Each macro name
       corresponds to a similar type name in <i>Integer Types</i>.

       Each instance of any defined macro shall be replaced by a
       constant expression suitable for use in <b>#if </b>preprocessing
       directives, and this expression shall have the same type as would
       an expression that is an object of the corresponding type
       converted according to the integer promotions. Its
       implementation-defined value shall be equal to or greater in
       magnitude (absolute value) than the corresponding value given
       below, with the same sign, except where stated to be exactly the
       given value.

           --  Maximum values of minimum-width signed integer types:

               {INT_LEAST<i>N</i>_MAX}
                               2<i>^N</i>-1 -1

           --  Maximum values of minimum-width unsigned integer types:

               {UINT_LEAST<i>N</i>_MAX}
                               2<i>^N</i> -1

        *  Limits of fastest minimum-width integer types

           --  Minimum values of fastest minimum-width signed integer
               types:

               {INT_FAST<i>N</i>_MIN} -(2<i>^N</i>-1 -1)

           --  Maximum values of fastest minimum-width signed integer
               types:

               {INT_FAST<i>N</i>_MAX} 2<i>^N</i>-1 -1

           --  Maximum values of fastest minimum-width unsigned integer
               types:

               {UINT_FAST<i>N</i>_MAX}
                               2<i>^N</i> -1

        *  Limits of integer types capable of holding object pointers

           --  Minimum value of pointer-holding signed integer type:

               {INTPTR_MIN}    -(2<i>^</i>15 -1)

           --  Maximum value of pointer-holding signed integer type:

               {INTPTR_MAX}    2<i>^</i>15 -1

           --  Maximum value of pointer-holding unsigned integer type:

               {UINTPTR_MAX}   2<i>^</i>16 -1

        *  Limits of greatest-width integer types

           --  Minimum value of greatest-width signed integer type:

   <b>Limits of Other Integer Types</b>
       The following macros specify the minimum and maximum limits of
       integer types corresponding to types defined in other standard
       headers.

       Each instance of these macros shall be replaced by a constant
       expression suitable for use in <b>#if </b>preprocessing directives, and
       this expression shall have the same type as would an expression
       that is an object of the corresponding type converted according
       to the integer promotions. Its implementation-defined value shall
       be equal to or greater in magnitude (absolute value) than the
       corresponding value given below, with the same sign.

        *  Limits of <b>ptrdiff_t</b>:

           {PTRDIFF_MIN}   -65535

           {PTRDIFF_MAX}   +65535

        *  Limits of <b>sig_atomic_t</b>:

           {SIG_ATOMIC_MIN}
                           See below.

           {SIG_ATOMIC_MAX}
                           See below.

        *  Limit of <b>size_t</b>:

           {SIZE_MAX}      65535

        *  Limits of <b>wchar_t</b>:

           {WCHAR_MIN}     See below.

           {WCHAR_MAX}     See below.

        *  Limits of <b>wint_t</b>:

           {WINT_MIN}      See below.

           {WINT_MAX}      See below.

       If <b>sig_atomic_t </b>(see the <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i> header) is defined as a
       signed integer type, the value of {SIG_ATOMIC_MIN} shall be no
       greater than -127 and the value of {SIG_ATOMIC_MAX} shall be no
       less than 127; otherwise, <b>sig_atomic_t </b>shall be defined as an
       unsigned integer type, and the value of {SIG_ATOMIC_MIN} shall be
       0 and the value of {SIG_ATOMIC_MAX} shall be no less than 255.

       If <b>wchar_t </b>(see the <i>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</i> header) is defined as a signed
       integer type, the value of {WCHAR_MIN} shall be no greater than
       -127 and the value of {WCHAR_MAX} shall be no less than 127;
       otherwise, <b>wchar_t </b>shall be defined as an unsigned integer type,
       and the value of {WCHAR_MIN} shall be 0 and the value of
       {WCHAR_MAX} shall be no less than 255.

       If <b>wint_t </b>(see the <i>&lt;wchar.h&gt;</i> header) is defined as a signed
       integer type, the value of {WINT_MIN} shall be no greater than
       -32767 and the value of {WINT_MAX} shall be no less than 32767;
       otherwise, <b>wint_t </b>shall be defined as an unsigned integer type,
       and the value of {WINT_MIN} shall be 0 and the value of
       {WINT_MAX} shall be no less than 65535.

   <b>Macros for Integer Constant Expressions</b>
       The following macros expand to integer constant expressions
       suitable for initializing objects that have integer types
       corresponding to types defined in the <i>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</i> header. Each
       macro name corresponds to a similar type name listed under
       <i>Minimum-width integer types</i> and <i>Greatest-width integer types</i>.

       Each invocation of one of these macros shall expand to an integer
       constant expression suitable for use in <b>#if </b>preprocessing
       directives. The type of the expression shall have the same type
       as would an expression that is an object of the corresponding
       type converted according to the integer promotions. The value of
       the expression shall be that of the argument.

       The argument in any instance of these macros shall be an
       unsuffixed integer constant with a value that does not exceed the
       limits for the corresponding type.

        *  Macros for minimum-width integer constant expressions

           The macro <i>INTN_C</i>(<i>value</i>) shall expand to an integer constant
           expression corresponding to the type <b>int_least</b><i>N</i><b>_t</b>.  The macro
           <i>UINTN_C</i>(<i>value</i>) shall expand to an integer constant expression
           corresponding to the type <b>uint_least</b><i>N</i><b>_t</b>.  For example, if
           <b>uint_least64_t </b>is a name for the type <b>unsigned long long</b>,
           then <i>UINT64_C</i>(0x123) might expand to the integer constant
           0x123ULL.

        *  Macros for greatest-width integer constant expressions

           The following macro expands to an integer constant expression
           having the value specified by its argument and the type
           <b>intmax_t</b>: INTMAX_C(<i>value</i>)

           The following macro expands to an integer constant expression
           having the value specified by its argument and the type
           <b>uintmax_t</b>: UINTMAX_C(<i>value</i>)

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</i> header is a subset of the <i>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</i> header more
       suitable for use in freestanding environments, which might not
       support the formatted I/O functions. In some environments, if the
       formatted conversion support is not wanted, using this header
       instead of the <i>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</i> header avoids defining such a large
       number of macros.

       As a consequence of adding <b>int8_t</b>, the following are true:

        *  A byte is exactly 8 bits.

        *  {CHAR_BIT} has the value 8, {SCHAR_MAX} has the value 127,
           {SCHAR_MIN} has the value -128, and {UCHAR_MAX} has the value
           255.

       (The POSIX standard explicitly requires 8-bit char and two's-
       complement arithmetic.)
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>typedef </b>names beginning with <b>int </b>or <b>uint </b>and ending with _t may
       be added to the types defined in the <i>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</i> header. Macro
       names beginning with INT or UINT and ending with _MAX, _MIN, or
       _C may be added to the macros defined in the <i>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</i> header.
