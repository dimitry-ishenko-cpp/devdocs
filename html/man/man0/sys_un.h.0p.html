PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sys/un.h — definitions for UNIX domain sockets
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/un.h&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>&lt;sys/un.h&gt;</i> header shall define the <b>sockaddr_un </b>structure,
       which shall include at least the following members:

           sa_family_t  sun_family  Address family.
           char         sun_path[]  Socket pathname.

       The <b>sockaddr_un </b>structure is used to store addresses for UNIX
       domain sockets.  Pointers to this type shall be cast by
       applications to <b>struct sockaddr * </b>for use with socket functions.

       The <i>&lt;sys/un.h&gt;</i> header shall define the <b>sa_family_t </b>type as
       described in <i>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</i>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The size of <i>sun_path</i> has intentionally been left undefined. This
       is because different implementations use different sizes. For
       example, 4.3 BSD uses a size of 108, and 4.4 BSD uses a size of
       104. Since most implementations originate from BSD versions, the
       size is typically in the range 92 to 108.

       Applications should not assume a particular length for <i>sun_path</i>
       or assume that it can hold {_POSIX_PATH_MAX} bytes (256).

       Although applications are required to initialize all members
       (including any non-standard ones) of a <b>sockaddr_in6 </b>structure
       (see <a href="netinet_in.h.0p.html">netinet_in.h(0p)</a>), the same is not required for the
       <b>sockaddr_un </b>structure, since historically many applications only
       initialized the standard members. Despite this, applications are
       encouraged to initialize <b>sockaddr_un </b>structures in a manner
       similar to the required initialization of <b>sockaddr_in6</b>
       structures.
