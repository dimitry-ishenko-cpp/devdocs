SYNOPSIS </h2>

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Some of the functionality described on this reference page
       extends the ISO C standard. Applications shall define the
       appropriate feature test macro (see the System Interfaces volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.2</i>, <i>The Compilation Environment</i>) to
       enable the visibility of these symbols in this header.

       Many of the symbols listed here are not defined by the
       ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard. Such symbols are not shown as CX
       shaded, except under the heading ``Numerical Limits''.

       The <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> header shall define macros and symbolic constants
       for various limits.  Different categories of limits are described
       below, representing various limits on resources that the
       implementation imposes on applications.  All macros and symbolic
       constants defined in this header shall be suitable for use in <b>#if</b>
       preprocessing directives.

       Implementations may choose any appropriate value for each limit,
       provided it is not more restrictive than the Minimum Acceptable
       Values listed below. Symbolic constant names beginning with
       _POSIX may be found in <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i>.

       Applications should not assume any particular value for a limit.
       To achieve maximum portability, an application should not require
       more resource than the Minimum Acceptable Value quantity.
       However, an application wishing to avail itself of the full
       amount of a resource available on an implementation may make use
       of the value given in <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> on that particular
       implementation, by using the macros and symbolic constants listed
       below. It should be noted, however, that many of the listed
       limits are not invariant, and at runtime, the value of the limit
       may differ from those given in this header, for the following
       reasons:

        *  The limit is pathname-dependent.

        *  The limit differs between the compile and runtime machines.

       For these reasons, an application may use the <i>fpathconf</i>(),
       <i>pathconf</i>(), and <i>sysconf</i>() functions to determine the actual value
       of a limit at runtime.

       The items in the list ending in _MIN give the most negative
       values that the mathematical types are guaranteed to be capable
       of representing.  Numbers of a more negative value may be
       supported on some implementations, as indicated by the <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i>
       header on the implementation, but applications requiring such
       numbers are not guaranteed to be portable to all implementations.
       For positive constants ending in _MIN, this indicates the minimum
       acceptable value.

   <b>Runtime Invariant Values (Possibly Indeterminate)</b>
       A definition of one of the symbolic constants in the following
       list shall be omitted from <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> on specific implementations
       where the corresponding value is equal to or greater than the
       stated minimum, but is unspecified.

       This indetermination might depend on the amount of available
       memory space on a specific instance of a specific implementation.
       The actual value supported by a specific instance shall be
       provided by the <i>sysconf</i>() function.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       A request was made to reduce the value of {_POSIX_LINK_MAX} from
       the value of 8 specified for it in the POSIX.1‐1990 standard to
       2. The standard developers decided to deny this request for
       several reasons:

        *  They wanted to avoid making any changes to the standard that
           could break conforming applications, and the requested change
           could have that effect.

        *  The use of multiple hard links to a file cannot always be
           replaced with use of symbolic links. Symbolic links are
           semantically different from hard links in that they associate
           a pathname with another pathname rather than a pathname with
           a file. This has implications for access control, file
           permanence, and transparency.

        *  The original standard developers had considered the issue of
           allowing for implementations that did not in general support
           hard links, and decided that this would reduce consensus on
           the standard.

       Systems that support historical versions of the development
       option of the ISO POSIX‐2 standard retain the name
       {_POSIX2_RE_DUP_MAX} as an alias for {_POSIX_RE_DUP_MAX}.

       {PATH_MAX}
             IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.1 #15 addressed the
             inconsistency in the standard with the definition of
             pathname and the description of {PATH_MAX}, allowing
             application developers to allocate either {PATH_MAX} or
             {PATH_MAX}+1 bytes. The inconsistency has been removed by
             correction to the {PATH_MAX} definition to include the null
             character. With this change, applications that previously
             allocated {PATH_MAX} bytes will continue to succeed.

       {SYMLINK_MAX}
             This symbol refers to space for data that is stored in the
             file system, as opposed to {PATH_MAX} which is the length
             of a name that can be passed to a function. In some
             existing implementations, the pathnames pointed to by
             symbolic links are stored in the <i>inode</i>s of the links, so it
             is important that {SYMLINK_MAX} not be constrained to be as
             large as {PATH_MAX}.
