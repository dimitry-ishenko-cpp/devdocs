SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int semctl(int </b><i>semid</i><b>, int </b><i>semnum</i><b>, int </b><i>op</i><b>, ...);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>semctl</b>() performs the control operation specified by <i>op</i> on the
       System V semaphore set identified by <i>semid</i>, or on the <i>semnum</i>-th
       semaphore of that set.  (The semaphores in a set are numbered
       starting at 0.)

       This function has three or four arguments, depending on <i>op</i>.  When
       there are four, the fourth has the type <i>union semun</i>.  The <i>calling</i>
       <i>program</i> must define this union as follows:

           union semun {
               int              val;    /* Value for SETVAL */
               struct semid_ds *buf;    /* Buffer for IPC_STAT, IPC_SET */
               unsigned short  *array;  /* Array for GETALL, SETALL */
               struct seminfo  *__buf;  /* Buffer for IPC_INFO
                                           (Linux-specific) */
           };

       The <i>semid_ds</i> data structure is defined in <i>&lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</i> as follows:

           struct semid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm sem_perm;  /* Ownership and permissions */
               time_t          sem_otime; /* Last semop time */
               time_t          sem_ctime; /* Creation time/time of last
                                             modification via semctl() */
               unsigned long   sem_nsems; /* No. of semaphores in set */
           };

       The fields of the <i>semid_ds</i> structure are as follows:

       <i>sem_perm</i>
              This is an <i>ipc_perm</i> structure (see below) that specifies
              the access permissions on the semaphore set.

       <i>sem_otime</i>
              Time of last <a href="semop.2.html">semop(2)</a> system call.

       <i>sem_ctime</i>
              Time of creation of semaphore set or time of last <b>semctl</b>()
              <b>IPCSET</b>, <b>SETVAL</b>, or <b>SETALL </b>operation.

       <i>sem_nsems</i>
              Number of semaphores in the set.  Each semaphore of the
              set is referenced by a nonnegative integer ranging from <b>0</b>
              to <i>sem_nsems-1</i>.

       The <i>ipc_perm</i> structure is defined as follows (the highlighted
       fields are settable using <b>IPC_SET</b>):

           struct ipc_perm {
               key_t          __key; /* Key supplied to semget(2) */
               uid_t          <b>uid</b>;   /* Effective UID of owner */
               gid_t          <b>gid</b>;   /* Effective GID of owner */
               uid_t          cuid;  /* Effective UID of creator */
               gid_t          cgid;  /* Effective GID of creator */
               unsigned short <b>mode</b>;  /* Permissions */
               unsigned short __seq; /* Sequence number */
           };

       The least significant 9 bits of the <i>mode</i> field of the <i>ipc_perm</i>
       structure define the access permissions for the shared memory
       segment.  The permission bits are as follows:
       0400   Read by user
       0200   Write by user
       0040   Read by group
       0020   Write by group
       0004   Read by others
       0002   Write by others

       In effect, "write" means "alter" for a semaphore set.  Bits 0100,
       0010, and 0001 (the execute bits) are unused by the system.

       Valid values for <i>op</i> are:

       <b>IPC_STAT</b>
              Copy information from the kernel data structure associated
              with <i>semid</i> into the <i>semid_ds</i> structure pointed to by
              <i>arg.buf</i>.  The argument <i>semnum</i> is ignored.  The calling
              process must have read permission on the semaphore set.

       <b>IPC_SET</b>
              Write the values of some members of the <i>semid_ds</i> structure
              pointed to by <i>arg.buf</i> to the kernel data structure
              associated with this semaphore set, updating also its
              <i>sem_ctime</i> member.

              The following members of the structure are updated:
              <i>sem_perm.uid</i>, <i>sem_perm.gid</i>, and (the least significant 9
              bits of) <i>sem_perm.mode</i>.

              The effective UID of the calling process must match the
              owner (<i>sem_perm.uid</i>) or creator (<i>sem_perm.cuid</i>) of the
              semaphore set, or the caller must be privileged.  The
              argument <i>semnum</i> is ignored.

       <b>IPC_RMID</b>
              Immediately remove the semaphore set, awakening all
              processes blocked in <a href="semop.2.html">semop(2)</a> calls on the set (with an
              error return and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>EIDRM</b>).  The effective user
              ID of the calling process must match the creator or owner
              of the semaphore set, or the caller must be privileged.
              The argument <i>semnum</i> is ignored.

       <b>IPC_INFO </b>(Linux-specific)
              Return information about system-wide semaphore limits and
              parameters in the structure pointed to by <i>arg.__buf</i>.  This
              structure is of type <i>seminfo</i>, defined in <i>&lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</i> if
              the <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>feature test macro is defined:

                  struct  seminfo {
                      int semmap;  /* Number of entries in semaphore
                                      map; unused within kernel */
                      int semmni;  /* Maximum number of semaphore sets */
                      int semmns;  /* Maximum number of semaphores in all
                                      semaphore sets */
                      int semmnu;  /* System-wide maximum number of undo
                                      structures; unused within kernel */
                      int semmsl;  /* Maximum number of semaphores in a
                                      set */
                      int semopm;  /* Maximum number of operations for
                                      semop(2) */
                      int semume;  /* Maximum number of undo entries per
                                      process; unused within kernel */
                      int semusz;  /* Size of struct sem_undo */
                      int semvmx;  /* Maximum semaphore value */
                      int semaem;  /* Max. value that can be recorded for
                                      semaphore adjustment (SEM_UNDO) */
                  };

              The <i>semmsl</i>, <i>semmns</i>, <i>semopm</i>, and <i>semmni</i> settings can be
              changed via <i>/proc/sys/kernel/sem</i>; see <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> for details.

       <b>SEM_INFO </b>(Linux-specific)
              Return a <i>seminfo</i> structure containing the same information
              as for <b>IPC_INFO</b>, except that the following fields are
              returned with information about system resources consumed
              by semaphores: the <i>semusz</i> field returns the number of
              semaphore sets that currently exist on the system; and the
              <i>semaem</i> field returns the total number of semaphores in all
              semaphore sets on the system.

       <b>SEM_STAT </b>(Linux-specific)
              Return a <i>semid_ds</i> structure as for <b>IPC_STAT</b>.  However, the
              <i>semid</i> argument is not a semaphore identifier, but instead
              an index into the kernel's internal array that maintains
              information about all semaphore sets on the system.

       <b>SEM_STAT_ANY </b>(Linux-specific, since Linux 4.17)
              Return a <i>semid_ds</i> structure as for <b>SEM_STAT</b>.  However,
              <i>sem_perm.mode</i> is not checked for read access for <i>semid</i>
              meaning that any user can employ this operation (just as
              any user may read <i>/proc/sysvipc/sem</i> to obtain the same
              information).

       <b>GETALL </b>Return <b>semval </b>(i.e., the current value) for all semaphores
              of the set into <i>arg.array</i>.  The argument <i>semnum</i> is
              ignored.  The calling process must have read permission on
              the semaphore set.

       <b>GETNCNT</b>
              Return the <b>semncnt </b>value for the <i>semnum</i>-th semaphore of
              the set (i.e., the number of processes waiting for the
              semaphore's value to increase).  The calling process must
              have read permission on the semaphore set.

       <b>GETPID </b>Return the <b>sempid </b>value for the <i>semnum</i>-th semaphore of the
              set.  This is the PID of the process that last performed
              an operation on that semaphore (but see NOTES).  The
              calling process must have read permission on the semaphore
              set.

       <b>GETVAL </b>Return <b>semval </b>(i.e., the semaphore value) for the
              <i>semnum</i>-th semaphore of the set.  The calling process must
              have read permission on the semaphore set.

       <b>GETZCNT</b>
              Return the <b>semzcnt </b>value for the <i>semnum</i>-th semaphore of
              the set (i.e., the number of processes waiting for the
              semaphore value to become 0).  The calling process must
              have read permission on the semaphore set.

       <b>SETALL </b>Set the <b>semval </b>values for all semaphores of the set using
              <i>arg.array</i>, updating also the <i>sem_ctime</i> member of the
              <i>semid_ds</i> structure associated with the set.  Undo entries
              (see <a href="semop.2.html">semop(2)</a>) are cleared for altered semaphores in all
              processes.  If the changes to semaphore values would
              permit blocked <a href="semop.2.html">semop(2)</a> calls in other processes to
              proceed, then those processes are woken up.  The argument
              <i>semnum</i> is ignored.  The calling process must have alter
              (write) permission on the semaphore set.

       <b>SETVAL </b>Set the semaphore value (<b>semval</b>) to <i>arg.val</i> for the
              <i>semnum</i>-th semaphore of the set, updating also the
              <i>sem_ctime</i> member of the <i>semid_ds</i> structure associated with
              the set.  Undo entries are cleared for altered semaphores
              in all processes.  If the changes to semaphore values
              would permit blocked <a href="semop.2.html">semop(2)</a> calls in other processes to
              proceed, then those processes are woken up.  The calling
              process must have alter permission on the semaphore set.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>semctl</b>() returns a nonnegative value depending on <i>op</i>
       as follows:

       <b>GETNCNT</b>
              the value of <b>semncnt</b>.

       <b>GETPID </b>the value of <b>sempid</b>.

       <b>GETVAL </b>the value of <b>semval</b>.

       <b>GETZCNT</b>
              the value of <b>semzcnt</b>.

       <b>IPC_INFO</b>
              the index of the highest used entry in the kernel's
              internal array recording information about all semaphore
              sets.  (This information can be used with repeated
              <b>SEM_STAT </b>or <b>SEM_STAT_ANY </b>operations to obtain information
              about all semaphore sets on the system.)

       <b>SEM_INFO</b>
              as for <b>IPC_INFO</b>.

       <b>SEM_STAT</b>
              the identifier of the semaphore set whose index was given
              in <i>semid</i>.

       <b>SEM_STAT_ANY</b>
              as for <b>SEM_STAT</b>.

       All other <i>op</i> values return 0 on success.

       On failure, <b>semctl</b>() returns -1 and sets <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EACCES </b>The argument <i>op</i> has one of the values <b>GETALL</b>, <b>GETPID</b>,
              <b>GETVAL</b>, <b>GETNCNT</b>, <b>GETZCNT</b>, <b>IPC_STAT</b>, <b>SEM_STAT</b>,
              <b>SEM_STAT_ANY</b>, <b>SETALL</b>, or <b>SETVAL </b>and the calling process
              does not have the required permissions on the semaphore
              set and does not have the <b>CAP_IPC_OWNER </b>capability in the
              user namespace that governs its IPC namespace.

       <b>EFAULT </b>The address pointed to by <i>arg.buf</i> or <i>arg.array</i> isn't
              accessible.

       <b>EIDRM  </b>The semaphore set was removed.

       <b>EINVAL </b>Invalid value for <i>op</i> or <i>semid</i>.  Or: for a <b>SEM_STAT</b>
              operation, the index value specified in <i>semid</i> referred to
              an array slot that is currently unused.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The argument <i>op</i> has the value <b>IPC_SET </b>or <b>IPC_RMID </b>but the
              effective user ID of the calling process is not the
              creator (as found in <i>sem_perm.cuid</i>) or the owner (as found
              in <i>sem_perm.uid</i>) of the semaphore set, and the process
              does not have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability.

       <b>ERANGE </b>The argument <i>op</i> has the value <b>SETALL </b>or <b>SETVAL </b>and the
              value to which <b>semval </b>is to be set (for some semaphore of
              the set) is less than 0 or greater than the implementation
              limit <b>SEMVMX</b>.
</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1 specifies the <i>sem_nsems</i> field of the <i>semid_ds</i> structure
       as having the type <i>unsigned short</i>, and the field is so defined on
       most other systems.  It was also so defined on Linux 2.2 and
       earlier, but, since Linux 2.4, the field has the type
       <i>unsigned long</i>.

   <b>The sempid value</b>
       POSIX.1 defines <i>sempid</i> as the "process ID of [the] last
       operation" on a semaphore, and explicitly notes that this value
       is set by a successful <a href="semop.2.html">semop(2)</a> call, with the implication that
       no other interface affects the <i>sempid</i> value.

       While some implementations conform to the behavior specified in
       POSIX.1, others do not.  (The fault here probably lies with
       POSIX.1 inasmuch as it likely failed to capture the full range of
       existing implementation behaviors.)  Various other
       implementations also update <i>sempid</i> for the other operations that
       update the value of a semaphore: the <b>SETVAL </b>and <b>SETALL</b>
       operations, as well as the semaphore adjustments performed on
       process termination as a consequence of the use of the <b>SEM_UNDO</b>
       flag (see <a href="semop.2.html">semop(2)</a>).

       Linux also updates <i>sempid</i> for <b>SETVAL </b>operations and semaphore
       adjustments.  However, somewhat inconsistently, up to and
       including Linux 4.5, the kernel did not update <i>sempid</i> for <b>SETALL</b>
       operations.  This was rectified in Linux 4.6.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4.

       Various fields in a <i>struct semid_ds</i> were typed as <i>short</i> under
       Linux 2.2 and have become <i>long</i> under Linux 2.4.  To take
       advantage of this, a recompilation under glibc-2.1.91 or later
       should suffice.  (The kernel distinguishes old and new calls by
       an <b>IPC_64 </b>flag in <i>op</i>.)

       In some earlier versions of glibc, the <i>semun</i> union was defined in
       <i>&lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</i>, but POSIX.1 requires that the caller define this
       union.  On versions of glibc where this union is <i>not</i> defined, the
       macro <b>_SEM_SEMUN_UNDEFINED </b>is defined in <i>&lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</i>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>IPC_INFO</b>, <b>SEM_STAT</b>, and <b>SEM_INFO </b>operations are used by the
       <a href="../man1/ipcs.1.html">ipcs(1)</a> program to provide information on allocated resources.
       In the future these may modified or moved to a <i>/proc</i> filesystem
       interface.

       The following system limit on semaphore sets affects a <b>semctl</b>()
       call:

       <b>SEMVMX </b>Maximum value for <b>semval</b>: implementation dependent
              (32767).

       For greater portability, it is best to always call <b>semctl</b>() with
       four arguments.
