</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>select</b>() and <b>pselect</b>() system calls are used to efficiently
       monitor multiple file descriptors, to see if any of them is, or
       becomes, "ready"; that is, to see whether I/O becomes possible,
       or an "exceptional condition" has occurred on any of the file
       descriptors.

       This page provides background and tutorial information on the use
       of these system calls.  For details of the arguments and
       semantics of <b>select</b>() and <b>pselect</b>(), see <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>.

   <b>Combining signal and data events</b>
       <b>pselect</b>() is useful if you are waiting for a signal as well as
       for file descriptor(s) to become ready for I/O.  Programs that
       receive signals normally use the signal handler only to raise a
       global flag.  The global flag will indicate that the event must
       be processed in the main loop of the program.  A signal will
       cause the <b>select</b>() (or <b>pselect</b>()) call to return with <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set
       to <b>EINTR</b>.  This behavior is essential so that signals can be
       processed in the main loop of the program, otherwise <b>select</b>()
       would block indefinitely.

       Now, somewhere in the main loop will be a conditional to check
       the global flag.  So we must ask: what if a signal arrives after
       the conditional, but before the <b>select</b>() call?  The answer is
       that <b>select</b>() would block indefinitely, even though an event is
       actually pending.  This race condition is solved by the <b>pselect</b>()
       call.  This call can be used to set the signal mask to a set of
       signals that are to be received only within the <b>pselect</b>() call.
       For instance, let us say that the event in question was the exit
       of a child process.  Before the start of the main loop, we would
       block <b>SIGCHLD </b>using <a href="sigprocmask.2.html">sigprocmask(2)</a>.  Our <b>pselect</b>() call would
       enable <b>SIGCHLD </b>by using an empty signal mask.  Our program would
       look like:

       static volatile sig_atomic_t got_SIGCHLD = 0;

       static void
       child_sig_handler(int sig)
       {
           got_SIGCHLD = 1;
       }

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           sigset_t sigmask, empty_mask;
           struct sigaction sa;
           fd_set readfds, writefds, exceptfds;
           int r;

           sigemptyset(&amp;sigmask);
           sigaddset(&amp;sigmask, SIGCHLD);
           if (sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &amp;sigmask, NULL) == -1) {
               perror("sigprocmask");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           sa.sa_flags = 0;
           sa.sa_handler = child_sig_handler;
           sigemptyset(&amp;sa.sa_mask);
           if (sigaction(SIGCHLD, &amp;sa, NULL) == -1) {
               perror("sigaction");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           sigemptyset(&amp;empty_mask);

           for (;;) {          /* main loop */
               /* Initialize readfds, writefds, and exceptfds
                  before the pselect() call. (Code omitted.) */

               r = pselect(nfds, &amp;readfds, &amp;writefds, &amp;exceptfds,
                           NULL, &amp;empty_mask);
               if (r == -1 &amp;&amp; errno != EINTR) {
                   /* Handle error */
               }

               if (got_SIGCHLD) {
                   got_SIGCHLD = 0;

                   /* Handle signalled event here; e.g., wait() for all
                      terminated children. (Code omitted.) */
               }

               /* main body of program */
           }
       }

   <b>Practical</b>
       So what is the point of <b>select</b>()?  Can't I just read and write to
       my file descriptors whenever I want?  The point of <b>select</b>() is
       that it watches multiple descriptors at the same time and
       properly puts the process to sleep if there is no activity.  UNIX
       programmers often find themselves in a position where they have
       to handle I/O from more than one file descriptor where the data
       flow may be intermittent.  If you were to merely create a
       sequence of <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> and <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> calls, you would find that one
       of your calls may block waiting for data from/to a file
       descriptor, while another file descriptor is unused though ready
       for I/O.  <b>select</b>() efficiently copes with this situation.

   <b>Select law</b>
       Many people who try to use <b>select</b>() come across behavior that is
       difficult to understand and produces nonportable or borderline
       results.  For instance, the above program is carefully written
       not to block at any point, even though it does not set its file
       descriptors to nonblocking mode.  It is easy to introduce subtle
       errors that will remove the advantage of using <b>select</b>(), so here
       is a list of essentials to watch for when using <b>select</b>().

       1.  You should always try to use <b>select</b>() without a timeout.
           Your program should have nothing to do if there is no data
           available.  Code that depends on timeouts is not usually
           portable and is difficult to debug.

       2.  The value <i>nfds</i> must be properly calculated for efficiency as
           explained above.

       3.  No file descriptor must be added to any set if you do not
           intend to check its result after the <b>select</b>() call, and
           respond appropriately.  See next rule.

       4.  After <b>select</b>() returns, all file descriptors in all sets
           should be checked to see if they are ready.

       5.  The functions <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, and <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a> do <i>not</i>
           necessarily read/write the full amount of data that you have
           requested.  If they do read/write the full amount, it's
           because you have a low traffic load and a fast stream.  This
           is not always going to be the case.  You should cope with the
           case of your functions managing to send or receive only a
           single byte.

       6.  Never read/write only in single bytes at a time unless you
           are really sure that you have a small amount of data to
           process.  It is extremely inefficient not to read/write as
           much data as you can buffer each time.  The buffers in the
           example below are 1024 bytes although they could easily be
           made larger.

       7.  Calls to <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a>, and <b>select</b>()
           can fail with the error <b>EINTR</b>, and calls to <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>,
           <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, and <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a> can fail with <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>EAGAIN</b>
           (<b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>).  These results must be properly managed (not
           done properly above).  If your program is not going to
           receive any signals, then it is unlikely you will get <b>EINTR</b>.
           If your program does not set nonblocking I/O, you will not
           get <b>EAGAIN</b>.

       8.  Never call <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, or <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a> with a
           buffer length of zero.

       9.  If the functions <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, and <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a> fail
           with errors other than those listed in <b>7.</b>, or one of the
           input functions returns 0, indicating end of file, then you
           should <i>not</i> pass that file descriptor to <b>select</b>() again.  In
           the example below, I close the file descriptor immediately,
           and then set it to -1 to prevent it being included in a set.

       10. The timeout value must be initialized with each new call to
           <b>select</b>(), since some operating systems modify the structure.
           <b>pselect</b>() however does not modify its timeout structure.

       11. Since <b>select</b>() modifies its file descriptor sets, if the call
           is being used in a loop, then the sets must be reinitialized
           before each call.

RETURN VALUE </h2>

       See <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Generally speaking, all operating systems that support sockets
       also support <b>select</b>().  <b>select</b>() can be used to solve many
       problems in a portable and efficient way that naive programmers
       try to solve in a more complicated manner using threads, forking,
       IPCs, signals, memory sharing, and so on.

       The <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> system call has the same functionality as <b>select</b>(),
       and is somewhat more efficient when monitoring sparse file
       descriptor sets.  It is nowadays widely available, but
       historically was less portable than <b>select</b>().

       The Linux-specific <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> API provides an interface that is
       more efficient than <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a> and <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> when monitoring large
       numbers of file descriptors.

       The above program properly forwards most kinds of TCP connections
       including OOB signal data transmitted by <b>telnet </b>servers.  It
       handles the tricky problem of having data flow in both directions
       simultaneously.  You might think it more efficient to use a
       <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> call and devote a thread to each stream.  This becomes
       more tricky than you might suspect.  Another idea is to set
       nonblocking I/O using <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.  This also has its problems
       because you end up using inefficient timeouts.

       The program does not handle more than one simultaneous connection
       at a time, although it could easily be extended to do this with a
       linked list of buffersâ€”one for each connection.  At the moment,
       new connections cause the current connection to be dropped.
