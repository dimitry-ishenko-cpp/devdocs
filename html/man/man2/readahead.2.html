</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       readahead - initiate file readahead into page cache
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#define _GNU_SOURCE             </b>/* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       <b>#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64</b>
       <b>#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</b>

       <b>ssize_t readahead(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, off_t </b><i>offset</i><b>, size_t </b><i>count</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>readahead</b>() initiates readahead on a file so that subsequent
       reads from that file will be satisfied from the cache, and not
       block on disk I/O (assuming the readahead was initiated early
       enough and that other activity on the system did not in the
       meantime flush pages from the cache).

       The <i>fd</i> argument is a file descriptor identifying the file which
       is to be read.  The <i>offset</i> argument specifies the starting point
       from which data is to be read and <i>count</i> specifies the number of
       bytes to be read.  I/O is performed in whole pages, so that
       <i>offset</i> is effectively rounded down to a page boundary and bytes
       are read up to the next page boundary greater than or equal to
       <i>(offset+count)</i>.  <b>readahead</b>() does not read beyond the end of the
       file.  The file offset of the open file description referred to
       by the file descriptor <i>fd</i> is left unchanged.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>readahead</b>() returns 0; on failure, -1 is returned,
       with <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EBADF  </b><i>fd</i> is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for
              reading.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>fd</i> does not refer to a file type to which <b>readahead</b>() can
              be applied.
</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       On some 32-bit architectures, the calling signature for this
       system call differs, for the reasons described in <a href="syscall.2.html">syscall(2)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 2.4.13, glibc 2.3.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS </b>should be defined to be 64 in code that uses a
       pointer to <b>readahead</b>, if the code is intended to be portable to
       traditional 32-bit x86 and ARM platforms where <b>off_t</b>'s width
       defaults to 32 bits.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>readahead</b>() attempts to schedule the reads in the background and
       return immediately.  However, it may block while it reads the
       filesystem metadata needed to locate the requested blocks.  This
       occurs frequently with ext[234] on large files using indirect
       blocks instead of extents, giving the appearance that the call
       blocks until the requested data has been read.
