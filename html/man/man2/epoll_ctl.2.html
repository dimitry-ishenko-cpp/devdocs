NAME </h2>
<pre>
       epoll_ctl - control interface for an epoll file descriptor
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/epoll.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int epoll_ctl(int </b><i>epfd</i><b>, int </b><i>op</i><b>, int </b><i>fd</i><b>,</b>
                     <b>struct epoll_event *_Nullable </b><i>event</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This system call is used to add, modify, or remove entries in the
       interest list of the <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> instance referred to by the file
       descriptor <i>epfd</i>.  It requests that the operation <i>op</i> be performed
       for the target file descriptor, <i>fd</i>.

       Valid values for the <i>op</i> argument are:

       <b>EPOLL_CTL_ADD</b>
              Add an entry to the interest list of the epoll file
              descriptor, <i>epfd</i>.  The entry includes the file descriptor,
              <i>fd</i>, a reference to the corresponding open file description
              (see <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> and <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>), and the settings specified in
              <i>event</i>.

       <b>EPOLL_CTL_MOD</b>
              Change the settings associated with <i>fd</i> in the interest
              list to the new settings specified in <i>event</i>.

       <b>EPOLL_CTL_DEL</b>
              Remove (deregister) the target file descriptor <i>fd</i> from the
              interest list.  The <i>event</i> argument is ignored and can be
              NULL (but see BUGS below).

       The <i>event</i> argument describes the object linked to the file
       descriptor <i>fd</i>.  The <i>struct epoll_event</i> is described in
       <a href="../man3/epoll_event.3type.html">epoll_event(3type)</a>.

       The <i>data</i> member of the <i>epoll_event</i> structure specifies data that
       the kernel should save and then return (via <a href="epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a>) when
       this file descriptor becomes ready.

       The <i>events</i> member of the <i>epoll_event</i> structure is a bit mask
       composed by ORing together zero or more event types, returned by
       <a href="epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a>, and input flags, which affect its behaviour, but
       aren't returned.  The available event types are:

       <b>EPOLLIN</b>
              The associated file is available for <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> operations.

       <b>EPOLLOUT</b>
              The associated file is available for <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> operations.

       <b>EPOLLRDHUP </b>(since Linux 2.6.17)
              Stream socket peer closed connection, or shut down writing
              half of connection.  (This flag is especially useful for
              writing simple code to detect peer shutdown when using
              edge-triggered monitoring.)

       <b>EPOLLPRI</b>
              There is an exceptional condition on the file descriptor.
              See the discussion of <b>POLLPRI </b>in <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>.

       <b>EPOLLERR</b>
              Error condition happened on the associated file
              descriptor.  This event is also reported for the write end
              of a pipe when the read end has been closed.

              <a href="epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a> will always report for this event; it is not
              necessary to set it in <i>events</i> when calling <b>epoll_ctl</b>().

       <b>EPOLLHUP</b>
              Hang up happened on the associated file descriptor.

              <a href="epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a> will always wait for this event; it is not
              necessary to set it in <i>events</i> when calling <b>epoll_ctl</b>().

              Note that when reading from a channel such as a pipe or a
              stream socket, this event merely indicates that the peer
              closed its end of the channel.  Subsequent reads from the
              channel will return 0 (end of file) only after all
              outstanding data in the channel has been consumed.

       And the available input flags are:

       <b>EPOLLET</b>
              Requests edge-triggered notification for the associated
              file descriptor.  The default behavior for <b>epoll </b>is level-
              triggered.  See <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> for more detailed information
              about edge-triggered and level-triggered notification.

       <b>EPOLLONESHOT </b>(since Linux 2.6.2)
              Requests one-shot notification for the associated file
              descriptor.  This means that after an event notified for
              the file descriptor by <a href="epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a>, the file descriptor
              is disabled in the interest list and no other events will
              be reported by the <b>epoll </b>interface.  The user must call
              <b>epoll_ctl</b>() with <b>EPOLL_CTL_MOD </b>to rearm the file
              descriptor with a new event mask.

       <b>EPOLLWAKEUP </b>(since Linux 3.5)
              If <b>EPOLLONESHOT </b>and <b>EPOLLET </b>are clear and the process has
              the <b>CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND </b>capability, ensure that the system
              does not enter "suspend" or "hibernate" while this event
              is pending or being processed.  The event is considered as
              being "processed" from the time when it is returned by a
              call to <a href="epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a> until the next call to <a href="epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a>
              on the same <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> file descriptor, the closure of that
              file descriptor, the removal of the event file descriptor
              with <b>EPOLL_CTL_DEL</b>, or the clearing of <b>EPOLLWAKEUP </b>for the
              event file descriptor with <b>EPOLL_CTL_MOD</b>.  See also BUGS.

       <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE </b>(since Linux 4.5)
              Sets an exclusive wakeup mode for the epoll file
              descriptor that is being attached to the target file
              descriptor, <i>fd</i>.  When a wakeup event occurs and multiple
              epoll file descriptors are attached to the same target
              file using <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE</b>, one or more of the epoll file
              descriptors will receive an event with <a href="epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a>.  The
              default in this scenario (when <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE </b>is not set)
              is for all epoll file descriptors to receive an event.
              <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE </b>is thus useful for avoiding thundering herd
              problems in certain scenarios.

              If the same file descriptor is in multiple epoll
              instances, some with the <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE </b>flag, and others
              without, then events will be provided to all epoll
              instances that did not specify <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE</b>, and at
              least one of the epoll instances that did specify
              <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE</b>.

              The following values may be specified in conjunction with
              <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE</b>: <b>EPOLLIN</b>, <b>EPOLLOUT</b>, <b>EPOLLWAKEUP</b>, and
              <b>EPOLLET</b>.  <b>EPOLLHUP </b>and <b>EPOLLERR </b>can also be specified, but
              this is not required: as usual, these events are always
              reported if they occur, regardless of whether they are
              specified in <i>events</i>.  Attempts to specify other values in
              <i>events</i> yield the error <b>EINVAL</b>.

              <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE </b>may be used only in an <b>EPOLL_CTL_ADD</b>
              operation; attempts to employ it with <b>EPOLL_CTL_MOD </b>yield
              an error.  If <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE </b>has been set using
              <b>epoll_ctl</b>(), then a subsequent <b>EPOLL_CTL_MOD </b>on the same
              <i>epfd</i>, <i>fd</i> pair yields an error.  A call to <b>epoll_ctl</b>() that
              specifies <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE </b>in <i>events</i> and specifies the
              target file descriptor <i>fd</i> as an epoll instance will
              likewise fail.  The error in all of these cases is <b>EINVAL</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       When successful, <b>epoll_ctl</b>() returns zero.  When an error occurs,
       <b>epoll_ctl</b>() returns -1 and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EBADF  </b><i>epfd</i> or <i>fd</i> is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>EEXIST </b><i>op</i> was <b>EPOLL_CTL_ADD</b>, and the supplied file descriptor <i>fd</i>
              is already registered with this epoll instance.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>epfd</i> is not an <b>epoll </b>file descriptor, or <i>fd</i> is the same as
              <i>epfd</i>, or the requested operation <i>op</i> is not supported by
              this interface.

       <b>EINVAL </b>An invalid event type was specified along with
              <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE </b>in <i>events</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>op</i> was <b>EPOLL_CTL_MOD </b>and <i>events</i> included <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE</b>.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>op</i> was <b>EPOLL_CTL_MOD </b>and the <b>EPOLLEXCLUSIVE </b>flag has
              previously been applied to this <i>epfd</i>, <i>fd</i> pair.

       <b>EINVAL EPOLLEXCLUSIVE </b>was specified in <i>event</i> and <i>fd</i> refers to an
              epoll instance.

       <b>ELOOP  </b><i>fd</i> refers to an epoll instance and this <b>EPOLL_CTL_ADD</b>
              operation would result in a circular loop of epoll
              instances monitoring one another or a nesting depth of
              epoll instances greater than 5.

       <b>ENOENT </b><i>op</i> was <b>EPOLL_CTL_MOD </b>or <b>EPOLL_CTL_DEL</b>, and <i>fd</i> is not
              registered with this epoll instance.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>There was insufficient memory to handle the requested <i>op</i>
              control operation.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The limit imposed by <i>/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches</i>
              was encountered while trying to register (<b>EPOLL_CTL_ADD</b>) a
              new file descriptor on an epoll instance.  See <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>
              for further details.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The target file <i>fd</i> does not support <b>epoll</b>.  This error can
              occur if <i>fd</i> refers to, for example, a regular file or a
              directory.

STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 2.6, glibc 2.3.2.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>epoll </b>interface supports all file descriptors that support
       <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Before Linux 2.6.9, the <b>EPOLL_CTL_DEL </b>operation required a non-
       null pointer in <i>event</i>, even though this argument is ignored.
       Since Linux 2.6.9, <i>event</i> can be specified as NULL when using
       <b>EPOLL_CTL_DEL</b>.  Applications that need to be portable to kernels
       before Linux 2.6.9 should specify a non-null pointer in <i>event</i>.

       If <b>EPOLLWAKEUP </b>is specified in <i>flags</i>, but the caller does not
       have the <b>CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND </b>capability, then the <b>EPOLLWAKEUP </b>flag
       is <i>silently ignored</i>.  This unfortunate behavior is necessary
       because no validity checks were performed on the <i>flags</i> argument
       in the original implementation, and the addition of the
       <b>EPOLLWAKEUP </b>with a check that caused the call to fail if the
       caller did not have the <b>CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND </b>capability caused a
       breakage in at least one existing user-space application that
       happened to randomly (and uselessly) specify this bit.  A robust
       application should therefore double check that it has the
       <b>CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND </b>capability if attempting to use the <b>EPOLLWAKEUP</b>
       flag.
