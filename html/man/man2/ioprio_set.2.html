</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>ioprio_get</b>() and <b>ioprio_set</b>() system calls get and set the
       I/O scheduling class and priority of one or more threads.

       The <i>which</i> and <i>who</i> arguments identify the thread(s) on which the
       system calls operate.  The <i>which</i> argument determines how <i>who</i> is
       interpreted, and has one of the following values:

       <b>IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS</b>
              <i>who</i> is a process ID or thread ID identifying a single
              process or thread.  If <i>who</i> is 0, then operate on the
              calling thread.

       <b>IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP</b>
              <i>who</i> is a process group ID identifying all the members of a
              process group.  If <i>who</i> is 0, then operate on the process
              group of which the caller is a member.

       <b>IOPRIO_WHO_USER</b>
              <i>who</i> is a user ID identifying all of the processes that
              have a matching real UID.

       If <i>which</i> is specified as <b>IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP </b>or <b>IOPRIO_WHO_USER </b>when
       calling <b>ioprio_get</b>(), and more than one process matches <i>who</i>, then
       the returned priority will be the highest one found among all of
       the matching processes.  One priority is said to be higher than
       another one if it belongs to a higher priority class
       (<b>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT </b>is the highest priority class; <b>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</b>
       is the lowest) or if it belongs to the same priority class as the
       other process but has a higher priority level (a lower priority
       number means a higher priority level).

       The <i>ioprio</i> argument given to <b>ioprio_set</b>() is a bit mask that
       specifies both the scheduling class and the priority to be
       assigned to the target process(es).  The following macros are
       used for assembling and dissecting <i>ioprio</i> values:

       <b>IOPRIO_PRIO_VALUE(</b><i>class</i><b>, </b><i>data</i><b>)</b>
              Given a scheduling <i>class</i> and priority (<i>data</i>), this macro
              combines the two values to produce an <i>ioprio</i> value, which
              is returned as the result of the macro.

       <b>IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(</b><i>mask</i><b>)</b>
              Given <i>mask</i> (an <i>ioprio</i> value), this macro returns its I/O
              class component, that is, one of the values
              <b>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT</b>, <b>IOPRIO_CLASS_BE</b>, or <b>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</b>.

       <b>IOPRIO_PRIO_DATA(</b><i>mask</i><b>)</b>
              Given <i>mask</i> (an <i>ioprio</i> value), this macro returns its
              priority (<i>data</i>) component.

       See the NOTES section for more information on scheduling classes
       and priorities, as well as the meaning of specifying <i>ioprio</i> as 0.

       I/O priorities are supported for reads and for synchronous
       (<b>O_DIRECT</b>, <b>O_SYNC</b>) writes.  I/O priorities are not supported for
       asynchronous writes because they are issued outside the context
       of the program dirtying the memory, and thus program-specific
       priorities do not apply.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>ioprio_get</b>() returns the <i>ioprio</i> value of the process
       with highest I/O priority of any of the processes that match the
       criteria specified in <i>which</i> and <i>who</i>.  On error, -1 is returned,
       and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.

       On success, <b>ioprio_set</b>() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned,
       and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EINVAL </b>Invalid value for <i>which</i> or <i>ioprio</i>.  Refer to the NOTES
              section for available scheduler classes and priority
              levels for <i>ioprio</i>.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The calling process does not have the privilege needed to
              assign this <i>ioprio</i> to the specified process(es).  See the
              NOTES section for more information on required privileges
              for <b>ioprio_set</b>().

       <b>ESRCH  </b>No process(es) could be found that matched the
              specification in <i>which</i> and <i>who</i>.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 2.6.13.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Two or more processes or threads can share an I/O context.  This
       will be the case when <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> was called with the <b>CLONE_IO </b>flag.
       However, by default, the distinct threads of a process will <b>not</b>
       share the same I/O context.  This means that if you want to
       change the I/O priority of all threads in a process, you may need
       to call <b>ioprio_set</b>() on each of the threads.  The thread ID that
       you would need for this operation is the one that is returned by
       <a href="gettid.2.html">gettid(2)</a> or <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>.

       These system calls have an effect only when used in conjunction
       with an I/O scheduler that supports I/O priorities.  As at kernel
       2.6.17 the only such scheduler is the Completely Fair Queuing
       (CFQ) I/O scheduler.

       If no I/O scheduler has been set for a thread, then by default
       the I/O priority will follow the CPU nice value (<a href="setpriority.2.html">setpriority(2)</a>).
       Before Linux 2.6.24, once an I/O priority had been set using
       <b>ioprio_set</b>(), there was no way to reset the I/O scheduling
       behavior to the default.  Since Linux 2.6.24, specifying <i>ioprio</i>
       as 0 can be used to reset to the default I/O scheduling behavior.

   <b>Selecting an I/O scheduler</b>
       I/O schedulers are selected on a per-device basis via the special
       file <i>/sys/block/</i>device<i>/queue/scheduler</i>.

       One can view the current I/O scheduler via the <i>/sys</i> filesystem.
       For example, the following command displays a list of all
       schedulers currently loaded in the kernel:

           $ <b>cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler</b>
           noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]

       The scheduler surrounded by brackets is the one actually in use
       for the device (<i>sda</i> in the example).  Setting another scheduler
       is done by writing the name of the new scheduler to this file.
       For example, the following command will set the scheduler for the
       <i>sda</i> device to <i>cfq</i>:

           $ <b>su</b>
           Password:
           # <b>echo cfq &gt; /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler</b>

   <b>The Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) I/O scheduler</b>
       Since version 3 (also known as CFQ Time Sliced), CFQ implements
       I/O nice levels similar to those of CPU scheduling.  These nice
       levels are grouped into three scheduling classes, each one
       containing one or more priority levels:

       <b>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT </b>(1)
              This is the real-time I/O class.  This scheduling class is
              given higher priority than any other class: processes from
              this class are given first access to the disk every time.
              Thus, this I/O class needs to be used with some care: one
              I/O real-time process can starve the entire system.
              Within the real-time class, there are 8 levels of class
              data (priority) that determine exactly how much time this
              process needs the disk for on each service.  The highest
              real-time priority level is 0; the lowest is 7.  In the
              future, this might change to be more directly mappable to
              performance, by passing in a desired data rate instead.

       <b>IOPRIO_CLASS_BE </b>(2)
              This is the best-effort scheduling class, which is the
              default for any process that hasn't set a specific I/O
              priority.  The class data (priority) determines how much
              I/O bandwidth the process will get.  Best-effort priority
              levels are analogous to CPU nice values (see
              <a href="getpriority.2.html">getpriority(2)</a>).  The priority level determines a priority
              relative to other processes in the best-effort scheduling
              class.  Priority levels range from 0 (highest) to 7
              (lowest).

       <b>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE </b>(3)
              This is the idle scheduling class.  Processes running at
              this level get I/O time only when no one else needs the
              disk.  The idle class has no class data.  Attention is
              required when assigning this priority class to a process,
              since it may become starved if higher priority processes
              are constantly accessing the disk.

       Refer to the kernel source file <i>Documentation/block/ioprio.txt</i>
       for more information on the CFQ I/O Scheduler and an example
       program.

   <b>Required permissions to set I/O priorities</b>
       Permission to change a process's priority is granted or denied
       based on two criteria:

       <b>Process ownership</b>
              An unprivileged process may set the I/O priority only for
              a process whose real UID matches the real or effective UID
              of the calling process.  A process which has the
              <b>CAP_SYS_NICE </b>capability can change the priority of any
              process.

       <b>What is the desired priority</b>
              Attempts to set very high priorities (<b>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT</b>)
              require the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability.  Up to Linux 2.6.24
              also required <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>to set a very low priority
              (<b>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</b>), but since Linux 2.6.25, this is no
              longer required.

       A call to <b>ioprio_set</b>() must follow both rules, or the call will
       fail with the error <b>EPERM</b>.
