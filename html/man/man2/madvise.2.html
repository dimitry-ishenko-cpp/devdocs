       <b>madvise</b>():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           Up to and including glibc 2.19:

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>madvise</b>() system call is used to give advice or directions to
       the kernel about the address range beginning at address <i>addr</i> and
       with size <i>length</i>.  <b>madvise</b>() only operates on whole pages,
       therefore <i>addr</i> must be page-aligned.  The value of <i>length</i> is
       rounded up to a multiple of page size.  In most cases, the goal
       of such advice is to improve system or application performance.

       Initially, the system call supported a set of "conventional"
       <i>advice</i> values, which are also available on several other
       implementations.  (Note, though, that <b>madvise</b>() is not specified
       in POSIX.)  Subsequently, a number of Linux-specific <i>advice</i>
       values have been added.

   <b>Conventional advice values</b>
       The <i>advice</i> values listed below allow an application to tell the
       kernel how it expects to use some mapped or shared memory areas,
       so that the kernel can choose appropriate read-ahead and caching
       techniques.  These <i>advice</i> values do not influence the semantics
       of the application (except in the case of <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>), but may
       influence its performance.  All of the <i>advice</i> values listed here
       have analogs in the POSIX-specified <a href="../man3/posix_madvise.3.html">posix_madvise(3)</a> function,
       and the values have the same meanings, with the exception of
       <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>.

       The advice is indicated in the <i>advice</i> argument, which is one of
       the following:

       <b>MADV_NORMAL</b>
              No special treatment.  This is the default.

       <b>MADV_RANDOM</b>
              Expect page references in random order.  (Hence, read
              ahead may be less useful than normally.)

       <b>MADV_SEQUENTIAL</b>
              Expect page references in sequential order.  (Hence, pages
              in the given range can be aggressively read ahead, and may
              be freed soon after they are accessed.)

       <b>MADV_WILLNEED</b>
              Expect access in the near future.  (Hence, it might be a
              good idea to read some pages ahead.)

       <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>
              Do not expect access in the near future.  (For the time
              being, the application is finished with the given range,
              so the kernel can free resources associated with it.)

              After a successful <b>MADV_DONTNEED </b>operation, the semantics
              of memory access in the specified region are changed:
              subsequent accesses of pages in the range will succeed,
              but will result in either repopulating the memory contents
              from the up-to-date contents of the underlying mapped file
              (for shared file mappings, shared anonymous mappings, and
              shmem-based techniques such as System V shared memory
              segments) or zero-fill-on-demand pages for anonymous
              private mappings.

              Note that, when applied to shared mappings, <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>
              might not lead to immediate freeing of the pages in the
              range.  The kernel is free to delay freeing the pages
              until an appropriate moment.  The resident set size (RSS)
              of the calling process will be immediately reduced
              however.

              <b>MADV_DONTNEED </b>cannot be applied to locked pages, or
              <b>VM_PFNMAP </b>pages.  (Pages marked with the kernel-internal
              <b>VM_PFNMAP </b>flag are special memory areas that are not
              managed by the virtual memory subsystem.  Such pages are
              typically created by device drivers that map the pages
              into user space.)

              Support for Huge TLB pages was added in Linux v5.18.
              Addresses within a mapping backed by Huge TLB pages must
              be aligned to the underlying Huge TLB page size, and the
              range length is rounded up to a multiple of the underlying
              Huge TLB page size.

   <b>Linux-specific advice values</b>
       The following Linux-specific <i>advice</i> values have no counterparts
       in the POSIX-specified <a href="../man3/posix_madvise.3.html">posix_madvise(3)</a>, and may or may not have
       counterparts in the <b>madvise</b>() interface available on other
       implementations.  Note that some of these operations change the
       semantics of memory accesses.

       <b>MADV_REMOVE </b>(since Linux 2.6.16)
              Free up a given range of pages and its associated backing
              store.  This is equivalent to punching a hole in the
              corresponding range of the backing store (see
              <a href="fallocate.2.html">fallocate(2)</a>).  Subsequent accesses in the specified
              address range will see data with a value of zero.

              The specified address range must be mapped shared and
              writable.  This flag cannot be applied to locked pages, or
              <b>VM_PFNMAP </b>pages.

              In the initial implementation, only <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a> supported
              <b>MADV_REMOVE</b>; but since Linux 3.5, any filesystem which
              supports the <a href="fallocate.2.html">fallocate(2)</a> <b>FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE </b>mode also
              supports <b>MADV_REMOVE</b>.  Filesystems which do not support
              <b>MADV_REMOVE </b>fail with the error <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>.

              Support for the Huge TLB filesystem was added in Linux
              v4.3.

       <b>MADV_DONTFORK </b>(since Linux 2.6.16)
              Do not make the pages in this range available to the child
              after a <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.  This is useful to prevent copy-on-write
              semantics from changing the physical location of a page if
              the parent writes to it after a <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.  (Such page
              relocations cause problems for hardware that DMAs into the
              page.)

       <b>MADV_DOFORK </b>(since Linux 2.6.16)
              Undo the effect of <b>MADV_DONTFORK</b>, restoring the default
              behavior, whereby a mapping is inherited across <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.

       <b>MADV_HWPOISON </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Poison the pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>
              and handle subsequent references to those pages like a
              hardware memory corruption.  This operation is available
              only for privileged (<b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>) processes.  This
              operation may result in the calling process receiving a
              <b>SIGBUS </b>and the page being unmapped.

              This feature is intended for testing of memory error-
              handling code; it is available only if the kernel was
              configured with <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.

       <b>MADV_MERGEABLE </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Enable Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) for the pages in the
              range specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>.  The kernel regularly
              scans those areas of user memory that have been marked as
              mergeable, looking for pages with identical content.
              These are replaced by a single write-protected page (which
              is automatically copied if a process later wants to update
              the content of the page).  KSM merges only private
              anonymous pages (see <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).

              The KSM feature is intended for applications that generate
              many instances of the same data (e.g., virtualization
              systems such as KVM).  It can consume a lot of processing
              power; use with care.  See the Linux kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/ksm.rst</i> for more details.

              The <b>MADV_MERGEABLE </b>and <b>MADV_UNMERGEABLE </b>operations are
              available only if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_KSM</b>.

       <b>MADV_UNMERGEABLE </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Undo the effect of an earlier <b>MADV_MERGEABLE </b>operation on
              the specified address range; KSM unmerges whatever pages
              it had merged in the address range specified by <i>addr</i> and
              <i>length</i>.

       <b>MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE </b>(since Linux 2.6.33)
              Soft offline the pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i> and
              <i>length</i>.  The memory of each page in the specified range is
              preserved (i.e., when next accessed, the same content will
              be visible, but in a new physical page frame), and the
              original page is offlined (i.e., no longer used, and taken
              out of normal memory management).  The effect of the
              <b>MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE </b>operation is invisible to (i.e., does
              not change the semantics of) the calling process.

              This feature is intended for testing of memory error-
              handling code; it is available only if the kernel was
              configured with <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.

       <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE </b>(since Linux 2.6.38)
              Enable Transparent Huge Pages (THP) for pages in the range
              specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>.  The kernel will regularly
              scan the areas marked as huge page candidates to replace
              them with huge pages.  The kernel will also allocate huge
              pages directly when the region is naturally aligned to the
              huge page size (see <b>posix_memalign</b>(2)).

              This feature is primarily aimed at applications that use
              large mappings of data and access large regions of that
              memory at a time (e.g., virtualization systems such as
              QEMU).  It can very easily waste memory (e.g., a 2 MB
              mapping that only ever accesses 1 byte will result in 2 MB
              of wired memory instead of one 4 KB page).  See the Linux
              kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.rst</i> for more
              details.

              Most common kernels configurations provide <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b>-
              style behavior by default, and thus <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE </b>is
              normally not necessary.  It is mostly intended for
              embedded systems, where <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b>-style behavior may
              not be enabled by default in the kernel.  On such systems,
              this flag can be used in order to selectively enable THP.
              Whenever <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE </b>is used, it should always be in
              regions of memory with an access pattern that the
              developer knows in advance won't risk to increase the
              memory footprint of the application when transparent
              hugepages are enabled.

              Since Linux 5.4, automatic scan of eligible areas and
              replacement by huge pages works with private anonymous
              pages (see <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>), shmem pages, and file-backed pages.
              For all memory types, memory may only be replaced by huge
              pages on hugepage-aligned boundaries.  For file-mapped
              memory â€”including tmpfs (see <b>tmpfs</b>(2))â€” the mapping must
              also be naturally hugepage-aligned within the file.
              Additionally, for file-backed, non-tmpfs memory, the file
              must not be open for write and the mapping must be
              executable.

              The VMA must not be marked <b>VM_NOHUGEPAGE</b>, <b>VM_HUGETLB</b>,
              <b>VM_IO</b>, <b>VM_DONTEXPAND</b>, <b>VM_MIXEDMAP</b>, or <b>VM_PFNMAP</b>, nor can
              it be stack memory or backed by a DAX-enabled device
              (unless the DAX device is hot-plugged as System RAM).  The
              process must also not have <b>PR_SET_THP_DISABLE </b>set (see
              <a href="prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>).

              The <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b>, <b>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE</b>, and <b>MADV_COLLAPSE</b>
              operations are available only if the kernel was configured
              with <b>CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE </b>and file/shmem memory is
              only supported if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS</b>.

       <b>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE </b>(since Linux 2.6.38)
              Ensures that memory in the address range specified by <i>addr</i>
              and <i>length</i> will not be backed by transparent hugepages.

       <b>MADV_COLLAPSE </b>(since Linux 6.1)
              Perform a best-effort synchronous collapse of the native
              pages mapped by the memory range into Transparent Huge
              Pages (THPs).  <b>MADV_COLLAPSE </b>operates on the current state
              of memory of the calling process and makes no persistent
              changes or guarantees on how pages will be mapped,
              constructed, or faulted in the future.

              <b>MADV_COLLAPSE </b>supports private anonymous pages (see
              <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>), shmem pages, and file-backed pages.  See
              <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE </b>for general information on memory
              requirements for THP.  If the range provided spans
              multiple VMAs, the semantics of the collapse over each VMA
              is independent from the others.  If collapse of a given
              huge page-aligned/sized region fails, the operation may
              continue to attempt collapsing the remainder of the
              specified memory.  <b>MADV_COLLAPSE </b>will automatically clamp
              the provided range to be hugepage-aligned.

              All non-resident pages covered by the range will first be
              swapped/faulted-in, before being copied onto a freshly
              allocated hugepage.  If the native pages compose the same
              PTE-mapped hugepage, and are suitably aligned, allocation
              of a new hugepage may be elided and collapse may happen
              in-place.  Unmapped pages will have their data directly
              initialized to 0 in the new hugepage.  However, for every
              eligible hugepage-aligned/sized region to be collapsed, at
              least one page must currently be backed by physical
              memory.

              <b>MADV_COLLAPSE </b>is independent of any sysfs (see <a href="../man5/sysfs.5.html">sysfs(5)</a>)
              setting under <i>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage</i>, both in
              terms of determining THP eligibility, and allocation
              semantics.  See Linux kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.rst</i> for more
              information.  <b>MADV_COLLAPSE </b>also ignores <b>huge= </b>tmpfs mount
              when operating on tmpfs files.  Allocation for the new
              hugepage may enter direct reclaim and/or compaction,
              regardless of VMA flags (though <b>VM_NOHUGEPAGE </b>is still
              respected).

              When the system has multiple NUMA nodes, the hugepage will
              be allocated from the node providing the most native
              pages.

              If all hugepage-sized/aligned regions covered by the
              provided range were either successfully collapsed, or were
              already PMD-mapped THPs, this operation will be deemed
              successful.  Note that this doesn't guarantee anything
              about other possible mappings of the memory.  In the event
              multiple hugepage-aligned/sized areas fail to collapse,
              only the most-recentlyâ€“failed code will be set in <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.

       <b>MADV_DONTDUMP </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              Exclude from a core dump those pages in the range
              specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>.  This is useful in
              applications that have large areas of memory that are
              known not to be useful in a core dump.  The effect of
              <b>MADV_DONTDUMP </b>takes precedence over the bit mask that is
              set via the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/coredump_filter</i> file (see <a href="../man5/core.5.html">core(5)</a>).

       <b>MADV_DODUMP </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              Undo the effect of an earlier <b>MADV_DONTDUMP</b>.

       <b>MADV_FREE </b>(since Linux 4.5)
              The application no longer requires the pages in the range
              specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>len</i>.  The kernel can thus free these
              pages, but the freeing could be delayed until memory
              pressure occurs.  For each of the pages that has been
              marked to be freed but has not yet been freed, the free
              operation will be canceled if the caller writes into the
              page.  After a successful <b>MADV_FREE </b>operation, any stale
              data (i.e., dirty, unwritten pages) will be lost when the
              kernel frees the pages.  However, subsequent writes to
              pages in the range will succeed and then kernel cannot
              free those dirtied pages, so that the caller can always
              see just written data.  If there is no subsequent write,
              the kernel can free the pages at any time.  Once pages in
              the range have been freed, the caller will see zero-fill-
              on-demand pages upon subsequent page references.

              The <b>MADV_FREE </b>operation can be applied only to private
              anonymous pages (see <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).  Before Linux 4.12, when
              freeing pages on a swapless system, the pages in the given
              range are freed instantly, regardless of memory pressure.

       <b>MADV_WIPEONFORK </b>(since Linux 4.14)
              Present the child process with zero-filled memory in this
              range after a <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.  This is useful in forking servers
              in order to ensure that sensitive per-process data (for
              example, PRNG seeds, cryptographic secrets, and so on) is
              not handed to child processes.

              The <b>MADV_WIPEONFORK </b>operation can be applied only to
              private anonymous pages (see <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).

              Within the child created by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, the <b>MADV_WIPEONFORK</b>
              setting remains in place on the specified address range.

       <b>MADV_KEEPONFORK </b>(since Linux 4.14)
              Undo the effect of an earlier <b>MADV_WIPEONFORK</b>.

       <b>MADV_COLD </b>(since Linux 5.4)
              Deactivate a given range of pages.  This will make the
              pages a more probable reclaim target should there be a
              memory pressure.  This is a nondestructive operation.  The
              advice might be ignored for some pages in the range when
              it is not applicable.

       <b>MADV_PAGEOUT </b>(since Linux 5.4)
              Reclaim a given range of pages.  This is done to free up
              memory occupied by these pages.  If a page is anonymous,
              it will be swapped out.  If a page is file-backed and
              dirty, it will be written back to the backing storage.
              The advice might be ignored for some pages in the range
              when it is not applicable.

       <b>MADV_POPULATE_READ </b>(since Linux 5.14)
              "Populate (prefault) page tables readable, faulting in all
              pages in the range just as if manually reading from each
              page; however, avoid the actual memory access that would
              have been performed after handling the fault.

              In contrast to <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>, <b>MADV_POPULATE_READ </b>does not
              hide errors, can be applied to (parts of) existing
              mappings and will always populate (prefault) page tables
              readable.  One example use case is prefaulting a file
              mapping, reading all file content from disk; however,
              pages won't be dirtied and consequently won't have to be
              written back to disk when evicting the pages from memory.

              Depending on the underlying mapping, map the shared
              zeropage, preallocate memory or read the underlying file;
              files with holes might or might not preallocate blocks.
              If populating fails, a <b>SIGBUS </b>signal is not generated;
              instead, an error is returned.

              If <b>MADV_POPULATE_READ </b>succeeds, all page tables have been
              populated (prefaulted) readable once.  If
              <b>MADV_POPULATE_READ </b>fails, some page tables might have been
              populated.

              <b>MADV_POPULATE_READ </b>cannot be applied to mappings without
              read permissions and special mappings, for example,
              mappings marked with kernel-internal flags such as
              <b>VM_PFNMAP </b>or <b>VM_IO</b>, or secret memory regions created using
              <a href="memfd_secret.2.html">memfd_secret(2)</a>.

              Note that with <b>MADV_POPULATE_READ</b>, the process can be
              killed at any moment when the system runs out of memory.

       <b>MADV_POPULATE_WRITE </b>(since Linux 5.14)
              Populate (prefault) page tables writable, faulting in all
              pages in the range just as if manually writing to each
              each page; however, avoid the actual memory access that
              would have been performed after handling the fault.

              In contrast to <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>, MADV_POPULATE_WRITE does not
              hide errors, can be applied to (parts of) existing
              mappings and will always populate (prefault) page tables
              writable.  One example use case is preallocating memory,
              breaking any CoW (Copy on Write).

              Depending on the underlying mapping, preallocate memory or
              read the underlying file; files with holes will
              preallocate blocks.  If populating fails, a <b>SIGBUS </b>signal
              is not generated; instead, an error is returned.

              If <b>MADV_POPULATE_WRITE </b>succeeds, all page tables have been
              populated (prefaulted) writable once.  If
              <b>MADV_POPULATE_WRITE </b>fails, some page tables might have
              been populated.

              <b>MADV_POPULATE_WRITE </b>cannot be applied to mappings without
              write permissions and special mappings, for example,
              mappings marked with kernel-internal flags such as
              <b>VM_PFNMAP </b>or <b>VM_IO</b>, or secret memory regions created using
              <a href="memfd_secret.2.html">memfd_secret(2)</a>.

              Note that with <b>MADV_POPULATE_WRITE</b>, the process can be
              killed at any moment when the system runs out of memory.

</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Versions of this system call, implementing a wide variety of
       <i>advice</i> values, exist on many other implementations.  Other
       implementations typically implement at least the flags listed
       above under <i>Conventional advice flags</i>, albeit with some variation
       in semantics.

       POSIX.1-2001 describes <a href="../man3/posix_madvise.3.html">posix_madvise(3)</a> with constants
       <b>POSIX_MADV_NORMAL</b>, <b>POSIX_MADV_RANDOM</b>, <b>POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL</b>,
       <b>POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED</b>, and <b>POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED</b>, and so on, with
       behavior close to the similarly named flags listed above.

   <b>Linux</b>
       The Linux implementation requires that the address <i>addr</i> be page-
       aligned, and allows <i>length</i> to be zero.  If there are some parts
       of the specified address range that are not mapped, the Linux
       version of <b>madvise</b>() ignores them and applies the call to the
       rest (but returns <b>ENOMEM </b>from the system call, as it should).

       <i>madvise(0, 0, advice)</i> will return zero iff <i>advice</i> is supported by
       the kernel and can be relied on to probe for support.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       First appeared in 4.4BSD.

       Since Linux 3.18, support for this system call is optional,
       depending on the setting of the <b>CONFIG_ADVISE_SYSCALLS</b>
       configuration option.
