</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>s390_guarded_storage</b>() system call enables the use of the
       Guarded Storage Facility (a z/Architecture-specific feature) for
       user-space processes.

       The guarded storage facility is a hardware feature that allows
       marking up to 64 memory regions (as of z14) as guarded; reading a
       pointer with a newly introduced "Load Guarded" (LGG) or "Load
       Logical and Shift Guarded" (LLGFSG) instructions will cause a
       range check on the loaded value and invoke a (previously set up)
       user-space handler if one of the guarded regions is affected.

       The <i>command</i> argument indicates which function to perform.  The
       following commands are supported:

       <b>GS_ENABLE</b>
              Enable the guarded storage facility for the calling task.
              The initial content of the guarded storage control block
              will be all zeros.  After enablement, user-space code can
              use the "Load Guarded Storage Controls" (LGSC) instruction
              (or the <b>load_gs_cb</b>() function wrapper provided in the
              <i>asm/guarded_storage.h</i> header) to load an arbitrary control
              block.  While a task is enabled, the kernel will save and
              restore the calling content of the guarded storage
              registers on context switch.

       <b>GS_DISABLE</b>
              Disables the use of the guarded storage facility for the
              calling task.  The kernel will cease to save and restore
              the content of the guarded storage registers, the task-
              specific content of these registers is lost.

       <b>GS_SET_BC_CB</b>
              Set a broadcast guarded storage control block to the one
              provided in the <i>gs_cb</i> argument.  This is called per thread
              and associates a specific guarded storage control block
              with the calling task.  This control block will be used in
              the broadcast command <b>GS_BROADCAST</b>.

       <b>GS_CLEAR_BC_CB</b>
              Clears the broadcast guarded storage control block.  The
              guarded storage control block will no longer have the
              association established by the <b>GS_SET_BC_CB </b>command.

       <b>GS_BROADCAST</b>
              Sends a broadcast to all thread siblings of the calling
              task.  Every sibling that has established a broadcast
              guarded storage control block will load this control block
              and will be enabled for guarded storage.  The broadcast
              guarded storage control block is consumed; a second
              broadcast without a refresh of the stored control block
              with <b>GS_SET_BC_CB </b>will not have any effect.

       The <i>gs_cb</i> argument specifies the address of a guarded storage
       control block structure and is currently used only by the
       <b>GS_SET_BC_CB </b>command; all other aforementioned commands ignore
       this argument.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, the return value of <b>s390_guarded_storage</b>() is 0.

       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EFAULT </b><i>command</i> was <b>GS_SET_BC_CB </b>and the copying of the guarded
              storage control block structure pointed by the <i>gs_cb</i>
              argument has failed.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value provided in the <i>command</i> argument was not valid.

       <b>ENOMEM </b><i>command</i> was one of <b>GS_ENABLE </b>or <b>GS_SET_BC_CB</b>, and the
              allocation of a new guarded storage control block has
              failed.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The guarded storage facility is not supported by the
              hardware.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux on s390.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 4.12.  System z14.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The description of the guarded storage facility along with
       related instructions and Guarded Storage Control Block and
       Guarded Storage Event Parameter List structure layouts is
       available in "z/Architecture Principles of Operations" beginning
       from the twelfth edition.

       The <i>gs_cb</i> structure has a field <i>gsepla</i> (Guarded Storage Event
       Parameter List Address), which is a user-space pointer to a
       Guarded Storage Event Parameter List structure (that contains the
       address of the aforementioned event handler in the <i>gseha</i> field),
       and its layout is available as a <b>gs_epl </b>structure type definition
       in the <i>asm/guarded_storage.h</i> header.
