       the use of <a href="syscall.2.html">syscall(2)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>membarrier</b>() system call helps reducing the overhead of the
       memory barrier instructions required to order memory accesses on
       multi-core systems.  However, this system call is heavier than a
       memory barrier, so using it effectively is <i>not</i> as simple as
       replacing memory barriers with this system call, but requires
       understanding of the details below.

       Use of memory barriers needs to be done taking into account that
       a memory barrier always needs to be either matched with its
       memory barrier counterparts, or that the architecture's memory
       model doesn't require the matching barriers.

       There are cases where one side of the matching barriers (which we
       will refer to as "fast side") is executed much more often than
       the other (which we will refer to as "slow side").  This is a
       prime target for the use of <b>membarrier</b>().  The key idea is to
       replace, for these matching barriers, the fast-side memory
       barriers by simple compiler barriers, for example:

           asm volatile ("" : : : "memory")

       and replace the slow-side memory barriers by calls to
       <b>membarrier</b>().

       This will add overhead to the slow side, and remove overhead from
       the fast side, thus resulting in an overall performance increase
       as long as the slow side is infrequent enough that the overhead
       of the <b>membarrier</b>() calls does not outweigh the performance gain
       on the fast side.

       The <i>cmd</i> argument is one of the following:

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY </b>(since Linux 4.3)
              Query the set of supported commands.  The return value of
              the call is a bit mask of supported commands.
              <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY</b>, which has the value 0, is not itself
              included in this bit mask.  This command is always
              supported (on kernels where <b>membarrier</b>() is provided).

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL </b>(since Linux 4.16)
              Ensure that all threads from all processes on the system
              pass through a state where all memory accesses to user-
              space addresses match program order between entry to and
              return from the <b>membarrier</b>() system call.  All threads on
              the system are targeted by this command.

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED </b>(since Linux 4.16)
              Execute a memory barrier on all running threads of all
              processes that previously registered with
              <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED</b>.

              Upon return from the system call, the calling thread has a
              guarantee that all running threads have passed through a
              state where all memory accesses to user-space addresses
              match program order between entry to and return from the
              system call (non-running threads are de facto in such a
              state).  This guarantee is provided only for the threads
              of processes that previously registered with
              <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED</b>.

              Given that registration is about the intent to receive the
              barriers, it is valid to invoke
              <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED </b>from a process that has
              not employed <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED</b>.

              The "expedited" commands complete faster than the non-
              expedited ones; they never block, but have the downside of
              causing extra overhead.

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED </b>(since Linux 4.16)
              Register the process's intent to receive
              <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED </b>memory barriers.

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED </b>(since Linux 4.14)
              Execute a memory barrier on each running thread belonging
              to the same process as the calling thread.

              Upon return from the system call, the calling thread has a
              guarantee that all its running thread siblings have passed
              through a state where all memory accesses to user-space
              addresses match program order between entry to and return
              from the system call (non-running threads are de facto in
              such a state).  This guarantee is provided only for
              threads in the same process as the calling thread.

              The "expedited" commands complete faster than the non-
              expedited ones; they never block, but have the downside of
              causing extra overhead.

              A process must register its intent to use the private
              expedited command prior to using it.

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED </b>(since Linux 4.14)
              Register the process's intent to use
              <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED</b>.

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_SYNC_CORE </b>(since Linux 4.16)
              In addition to providing the memory ordering guarantees
              described in <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED</b>, upon return
              from system call the calling thread has a guarantee that
              all its running thread siblings have executed a core
              serializing instruction.  This guarantee is provided only
              for threads in the same process as the calling thread.

              The "expedited" commands complete faster than the non-
              expedited ones, they never block, but have the downside of
              causing extra overhead.

              A process must register its intent to use the private
              expedited sync core command prior to using it.

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_SYNC_CORE </b>(since Linux
       4.16)
              Register the process's intent to use
              <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_SYNC_CORE</b>.

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ </b>(since Linux 5.10)
              Ensure the caller thread, upon return from system call,
              that all its running thread siblings have any currently
              running rseq critical sections restarted if <i>flags</i>
              parameter is 0; if <i>flags</i> parameter is
              <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_FLAG_CPU</b>, then this operation is performed
              only on CPU indicated by <i>cpu_id</i>.  This guarantee is
              provided only for threads in the same process as the
              calling thread.

              RSEQ membarrier is only available in the "private
              expedited" form.

              A process must register its intent to use the private
              expedited rseq command prior to using it.

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ </b>(since Linux 5.10)
              Register the process's intent to use
              <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ</b>.

       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED </b>(since Linux 4.3)
              This is an alias for <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL </b>that exists for
              header backward compatibility.

       The <i>flags</i> argument must be specified as 0 unless the command is
       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ</b>, in which case <i>flags</i> can be
       either 0 or <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_FLAG_CPU</b>.

       The <i>cpu_id</i> argument is ignored unless <i>flags</i> is
       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_FLAG_CPU</b>, in which case it must specify the CPU
       targeted by this membarrier command.

       All memory accesses performed in program order from each targeted
       thread are guaranteed to be ordered with respect to <b>membarrier</b>().

       If we use the semantic <i>barrier()</i> to represent a compiler barrier
       forcing memory accesses to be performed in program order across
       the barrier, and <i>smp_mb()</i> to represent explicit memory barriers
       forcing full memory ordering across the barrier, we have the
       following ordering table for each pairing of <i>barrier()</i>,
       <b>membarrier</b>(), and <i>smp_mb()</i>.  The pair ordering is detailed as (O:
       ordered, X: not ordered):

                             barrier()   smp_mb()   membarrier()
              barrier()          X          X            O
              smp_mb()           X          O            O
              membarrier()       O          O            O
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, the <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY </b>operation returns a bit mask
       of supported commands, and the <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL</b>,
       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED</b>,
       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED</b>,
       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED</b>,
       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED</b>,
       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_SYNC_CORE</b>, and
       <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_SYNC_CORE </b>operations
       return zero.  On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to
       indicate the error.

       For a given command, with <i>flags</i> set to 0, this system call is
       guaranteed to always return the same value until reboot.  Further
       calls with the same arguments will lead to the same result.
       Therefore, with <i>flags</i> set to 0, error handling is required only
       for the first call to <b>membarrier</b>().

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 4.3.

       Before Linux 5.10, the prototype was:

           <b>int membarrier(int </b><i>cmd</i><b>, int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       A memory barrier instruction is part of the instruction set of
       architectures with weakly ordered memory models.  It orders
       memory accesses prior to the barrier and after the barrier with
       respect to matching barriers on other cores.  For instance, a
       load fence can order loads prior to and following that fence with
       respect to stores ordered by store fences.

       Program order is the order in which instructions are ordered in
       the program assembly code.

       Examples where <b>membarrier</b>() can be useful include implementations
       of Read-Copy-Update libraries and garbage collectors.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Assuming a multithreaded application where "fast_path()" is
       executed very frequently, and where "slow_path()" is executed
       infrequently, the following code (x86) can be transformed using
       <b>membarrier</b>():

           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

           static volatile int a, b;

           static void
           fast_path(int *read_b)
           {
               a = 1;
               asm volatile ("mfence" : : : "memory");
               *read_b = b;
           }

           static void
           slow_path(int *read_a)
           {
               b = 1;
               asm volatile ("mfence" : : : "memory");
               *read_a = a;
           }

           int
           main(void)
           {

               /*
