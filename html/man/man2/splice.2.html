DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>splice</b>() moves data between two file descriptors without copying
       between kernel address space and user address space.  It
       transfers up to <i>len</i> bytes of data from the file descriptor <i>fd_in</i>
       to the file descriptor <i>fd_out</i>, where one of the file descriptors
       must refer to a pipe.

       The following semantics apply for <i>fd_in</i> and <i>off_in</i>:

       •  If <i>fd_in</i> refers to a pipe, then <i>off_in</i> must be NULL.

       •  If <i>fd_in</i> does not refer to a pipe and <i>off_in</i> is NULL, then
          bytes are read from <i>fd_in</i> starting from the file offset, and
          the file offset is adjusted appropriately.

       •  If <i>fd_in</i> does not refer to a pipe and <i>off_in</i> is not NULL, then
          <i>off_in</i> must point to a buffer which specifies the starting
          offset from which bytes will be read from <i>fd_in</i>; in this case,
          the file offset of <i>fd_in</i> is not changed.

       Analogous statements apply for <i>fd_out</i> and <i>off_out</i>.

       The <i>flags</i> argument is a bit mask that is composed by ORing
       together zero or more of the following values:

       <b>SPLICE_F_MOVE</b>
              Attempt to move pages instead of copying.  This is only a
              hint to the kernel: pages may still be copied if the
              kernel cannot move the pages from the pipe, or if the pipe
              buffers don't refer to full pages.  The initial
              implementation of this flag was buggy: therefore starting
              in Linux 2.6.21 it is a no-op (but is still permitted in a
              <b>splice</b>() call); in the future, a correct implementation
              may be restored.

       <b>SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK</b>
              Do not block on I/O.  This makes the splice pipe
              operations nonblocking, but <b>splice</b>() may nevertheless
              block because the file descriptors that are spliced
              to/from may block (unless they have the <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>flag
              set).

       <b>SPLICE_F_MORE</b>
              More data will be coming in a subsequent splice.  This is
              a helpful hint when the <i>fd_out</i> refers to a socket (see
              also the description of <b>MSG_MORE </b>in <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a>, and the
              description of <b>TCP_CORK </b>in <a href="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp(7)</a>).

       <b>SPLICE_F_GIFT</b>
              Unused for <b>splice</b>(); see <a href="vmsplice.2.html">vmsplice(2)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <b>splice</b>() returns the number of bytes
       spliced to or from the pipe.

       A return value of 0 means end of input.  If <i>fd_in</i> refers to a
       pipe, then this means that there was no data to transfer, and it
       would not make sense to block because there are no writers
       connected to the write end of the pipe.

       On error, <b>splice</b>() returns -1 and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EAGAIN SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK </b>was specified in <i>flags</i> or one of the
              file descriptors had been marked as nonblocking
              (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>)<b>, </b>and the operation would block.

       <b>EBADF  </b>One or both file descriptors are not valid, or do not have
              proper read-write mode.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The target filesystem doesn't support splicing.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The target file is opened in append mode.

       <b>EINVAL </b>Neither of the file descriptors refers to a pipe.

       <b>EINVAL </b>An offset was given for nonseekable device (e.g., a pipe).

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>fd_in</i> and <i>fd_out</i> refer to the same pipe.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Out of memory.

       <b>ESPIPE </b>Either <i>off_in</i> or <i>off_out</i> was not NULL, but the
              corresponding file descriptor refers to a pipe.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 2.6.17, glibc 2.5.

       In Linux 2.6.30 and earlier, exactly one of <i>fd_in</i> and <i>fd_out</i> was
       required to be a pipe.  Since Linux 2.6.31, both arguments may
       refer to pipes.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The three system calls <b>splice</b>(), <a href="vmsplice.2.html">vmsplice(2)</a>, and <a href="tee.2.html">tee(2)</a>, provide
       user-space programs with full control over an arbitrary kernel
       buffer, implemented within the kernel using the same type of
       buffer that is used for a pipe.  In overview, these system calls
       perform the following tasks:

       <b>splice</b>()
              moves data from the buffer to an arbitrary file
              descriptor, or vice versa, or from one buffer to another.

       <a href="tee.2.html">tee(2)</a> "copies" the data from one buffer to another.

       <a href="vmsplice.2.html">vmsplice(2)</a>
              "copies" data from user space into the buffer.

       Though we talk of copying, actual copies are generally avoided.
       The kernel does this by implementing a pipe buffer as a set of
       reference-counted pointers to pages of kernel memory.  The kernel
       creates "copies" of pages in a buffer by creating new pointers
       (for the output buffer) referring to the pages, and increasing
       the reference counts for the pages: only pointers are copied, not
       the pages of the buffer.

       <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS </b>should be defined to be 64 in code that uses
       non-null <i>off_in</i> or <i>off_out</i> or that takes the address of <b>splice</b>,
       if the code is intended to be portable to traditional 32-bit x86
       and ARM platforms where <b>off_t</b>'s width defaults to 32 bits.
