DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This function returns information about a file, storing it in the
       buffer pointed to by <i>statxbuf</i>.  The returned buffer is a
       structure of the following type:

           struct statx {
               __u32 stx_mask;        /* Mask of bits indicating
                                         filled fields */
               __u32 stx_blksize;     /* Block size for filesystem I/O */
               __u64 stx_attributes;  /* Extra file attribute indicators */
               __u32 stx_nlink;       /* Number of hard links */
               __u32 stx_uid;         /* User ID of owner */
               __u32 stx_gid;         /* Group ID of owner */
               __u16 stx_mode;        /* File type and mode */
               __u64 stx_ino;         /* Inode number */
               __u64 stx_size;        /* Total size in bytes */
               __u64 stx_blocks;      /* Number of 512B blocks allocated */
               __u64 stx_attributes_mask;
                                      /* Mask to show what's supported
                                         in stx_attributes */

               /* The following fields are file timestamps */
               struct statx_timestamp stx_atime;  /* Last access */
               struct statx_timestamp stx_btime;  /* Creation */
               struct statx_timestamp stx_ctime;  /* Last status change */
               struct statx_timestamp stx_mtime;  /* Last modification */

               /* If this file represents a device, then the next two
                  fields contain the ID of the device */
               __u32 stx_rdev_major;  /* Major ID */
               __u32 stx_rdev_minor;  /* Minor ID */

               /* The next two fields contain the ID of the device
                  containing the filesystem where the file resides */
               __u32 stx_dev_major;   /* Major ID */
               __u32 stx_dev_minor;   /* Minor ID */

               __u64 stx_mnt_id;      /* Mount ID */

               /* Direct I/O alignment restrictions */
               __u32 stx_dio_mem_align;
               __u32 stx_dio_offset_align;
           };

       The file timestamps are structures of the following type:

           struct statx_timestamp {
               __s64 tv_sec;    /* Seconds since the Epoch (UNIX time) */
               __u32 tv_nsec;   /* Nanoseconds since tv_sec */
           };

       (Note that reserved space and padding is omitted.)

   <b>Invoking statx</b>():
       To access a file's status, no permissions are required on the
       file itself, but in the case of <b>statx</b>() with a pathname, execute
       (search) permission is required on all of the directories in
       <i>pathname</i> that lead to the file.

       <b>statx</b>() uses <i>pathname</i>, <i>dirfd</i>, and <i>flags</i> to identify the target
       file in one of the following ways:

       An absolute pathname
              If <i>pathname</i> begins with a slash, then it is an absolute
              pathname that identifies the target file.  In this case,
              <i>dirfd</i> is ignored.

       A relative pathname
              If <i>pathname</i> is a string that begins with a character other
              than a slash and <i>dirfd</i> is <b>AT_FDCWD</b>, then <i>pathname</i> is a
              relative pathname that is interpreted relative to the
              process's current working directory.

       A directory-relative pathname
              If <i>pathname</i> is a string that begins with a character other
              than a slash and <i>dirfd</i> is a file descriptor that refers to
              a directory, then <i>pathname</i> is a relative pathname that is
              interpreted relative to the directory referred to by
              <i>dirfd</i>.  (See <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a> for an explanation of why this is
              useful.)

       By file descriptor
              If <i>pathname</i> is an empty string and the <b>AT_EMPTY_PATH </b>flag
              is specified in <i>flags</i> (see below), then the target file is
              the one referred to by the file descriptor <i>dirfd</i>.

       <i>flags</i> can be used to influence a pathname-based lookup.  A value
       for <i>flags</i> is constructed by ORing together zero or more of the
       following constants:

       <b>AT_EMPTY_PATH</b>
              If <i>pathname</i> is an empty string, operate on the file
              referred to by <i>dirfd</i> (which may have been obtained using
              the <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a> <b>O_PATH </b>flag).  In this case, <i>dirfd</i> can refer
              to any type of file, not just a directory.

              If <i>dirfd</i> is <b>AT_FDCWD</b>, the call operates on the current
              working directory.

       <b>AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT</b>
              Don't automount the terminal ("basename") component of
              <i>pathname</i> if it is a directory that is an automount point.
              This allows the caller to gather attributes of an
              automount point (rather than the location it would mount).
              This flag has no effect if the mount point has already
              been mounted over.

              The <b>AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT </b>flag can be used in tools that scan
              directories to prevent mass-automounting of a directory of
              automount points.

              All of <a href="stat.2.html">stat(2)</a>, <a href="lstat.2.html">lstat(2)</a>, and <a href="fstatat.2.html">fstatat(2)</a> act as though
              <b>AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT </b>was set.

       <b>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</b>
              If <i>pathname</i> is a symbolic link, do not dereference it:
              instead return information about the link itself, like
              <a href="lstat.2.html">lstat(2)</a>.

       <i>flags</i> can also be used to control what sort of synchronization
       the kernel will do when querying a file on a remote filesystem.
       This is done by ORing in one of the following values:

       <b>AT_STATX_SYNC_AS_STAT</b>
              Do whatever <a href="stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> does.  This is the default and is very
              much filesystem-specific.

       <b>AT_STATX_FORCE_SYNC</b>
              Force the attributes to be synchronized with the server.
              This may require that a network filesystem perform a data
              writeback to get the timestamps correct.

       <b>AT_STATX_DONT_SYNC</b>
              Don't synchronize anything, but rather just take whatever
              the system has cached if possible.  This may mean that the
              information returned is approximate, but, on a network
              filesystem, it may not involve a round trip to the server
              - even if no lease is held.

       The <i>mask</i> argument to <b>statx</b>() is used to tell the kernel which
       fields the caller is interested in.  <i>mask</i> is an ORed combination
       of the following constants:

           <b>STATX_TYPE          </b>Want stx_mode &amp; S_IFMT
           <b>STATX_MODE          </b>Want stx_mode &amp; ~S_IFMT
           <b>STATX_NLINK         </b>Want stx_nlink
           <b>STATX_UID           </b>Want stx_uid
           <b>STATX_GID           </b>Want stx_gid
           <b>STATX_ATIME         </b>Want stx_atime
           <b>STATX_MTIME         </b>Want stx_mtime
           <b>STATX_CTIME         </b>Want stx_ctime
           <b>STATX_INO           </b>Want stx_ino
           <b>STATX_SIZE          </b>Want stx_size
           <b>STATX_BLOCKS        </b>Want stx_blocks
           <b>STATX_BASIC_STATS   </b>[All of the above]
           <b>STATX_BTIME         </b>Want stx_btime
           <b>STATX_ALL           </b>The same as STATX_BASIC_STATS | STATX_BTIME.
                               It is deprecated and should not be used.
           <b>STATX_MNT_ID        </b>Want stx_mnt_id (since Linux 5.8)
           <b>STATX_DIOALIGN      </b>Want stx_dio_mem_align and stx_dio_offset_align
                               (since Linux 6.1; support varies by filesystem)

       Note that, in general, the kernel does <i>not</i> reject values in <i>mask</i>
       other than the above.  (For an exception, see <b>EINVAL </b>in errors.)
       Instead, it simply informs the caller which values are supported
       by this kernel and filesystem via the <i>statx.stx_mask</i> field.
       Therefore, <i>do not</i> simply set <i>mask</i> to <b>UINT_MAX </b>(all bits set), as
       one or more bits may, in the future, be used to specify an
       extension to the buffer.

   <b>The returned information</b>
       The status information for the target file is returned in the
       <i>statx</i> structure pointed to by <i>statxbuf</i>.  Included in this is
       <i>stx_mask</i> which indicates what other information has been
       returned.  <i>stx_mask</i> has the same format as the <i>mask</i> argument and
       bits are set in it to indicate which fields have been filled in.

       It should be noted that the kernel may return fields that weren't
       requested and may fail to return fields that were requested,
       depending on what the backing filesystem supports.  (Fields that
       are given values despite being unrequested can just be ignored.)
       In either case, <i>stx_mask</i> will not be equal <i>mask</i>.

       If a filesystem does not support a field or if it has an
       unrepresentable value (for instance, a file with an exotic type),
       then the mask bit corresponding to that field will be cleared in
       <i>stx_mask</i> even if the user asked for it and a dummy value will be
       filled in for compatibility purposes if one is available (e.g., a
       dummy UID and GID may be specified to mount under some
       circumstances).

       A filesystem may also fill in fields that the caller didn't ask
       for if it has values for them available and the information is
       available at no extra cost.  If this happens, the corresponding
       bits will be set in <i>stx_mask</i>.

       <i>Note</i>: for performance and simplicity reasons, different fields in
       the <i>statx</i> structure may contain state information from different
       moments during the execution of the system call.  For example, if
       <i>stx_mode</i> or <i>stx_uid</i> is changed by another process by calling
       <a href="chmod.2.html">chmod(2)</a> or <a href="chown.2.html">chown(2)</a>, <b>stat</b>() might return the old <i>stx_mode</i>
       together with the new <i>stx_uid</i>, or the old <i>stx_uid</i> together with
       the new <i>stx_mode</i>.

       Apart from <i>stx_mask</i> (which is described above), the fields in the
       <i>statx</i> structure are:

       <i>stx_blksize</i>
              The "preferred" block size for efficient filesystem I/O.
              (Writing to a file in smaller chunks may cause an
              inefficient read-modify-rewrite.)

       <i>stx_attributes</i>
              Further status information about the file (see below for
              more information).

       <i>stx_nlink</i>
              The number of hard links on a file.

       <i>stx_uid</i>
              This field contains the user ID of the owner of the file.

       <i>stx_gid</i>
              This field contains the ID of the group owner of the file.

       <i>stx_mode</i>
              The file type and mode.  See <a href="../man7/inode.7.html">inode(7)</a> for details.

       <i>stx_ino</i>
              The inode number of the file.

       <i>stx_size</i>
              The size of the file (if it is a regular file or a
              symbolic link) in bytes.  The size of a symbolic link is
              the length of the pathname it contains, without a
              terminating null byte.

       <i>stx_blocks</i>
              The number of blocks allocated to the file on the medium,
              in 512-byte units.  (This may be smaller than <i>stx_size</i>/512
              when the file has holes.)

       <i>stx_attributes_mask</i>
              A mask indicating which bits in <i>stx_attributes</i> are
              supported by the VFS and the filesystem.

       <i>stx_atime</i>
              The file's last access timestamp.

       <i>stx_btime</i>
              The file's creation timestamp.

       <i>stx_ctime</i>
              The file's last status change timestamp.

       <i>stx_mtime</i>
              The file's last modification timestamp.

       <i>stx_dev_major</i> and <i>stx_dev_minor</i>
              The device on which this file (inode) resides.

       <i>stx_rdev_major</i> and <i>stx_rdev_minor</i>
              The device that this file (inode) represents if the file
              is of block or character device type.

       <i>stx_mnt_id</i>
              The mount ID of the mount containing the file.  This is
              the same number reported by <a href="name_to_handle_at.2.html">name_to_handle_at(2)</a> and
              corresponds to the number in the first field in one of the
              records in <i>/proc/self/mountinfo</i>.

       <i>stx_dio_mem_align</i>
              The alignment (in bytes) required for user memory buffers
              for direct I/O (<b>O_DIRECT</b>) on this file, or 0 if direct I/O
              is not supported on this file.

              <b>STATX_DIOALIGN </b>(<i>stx_dio_mem_align</i> and
              <i>stx_dio_offset_align</i>) is supported on block devices since
              Linux 6.1.  The support on regular files varies by
              filesystem; it is supported by ext4, f2fs, and xfs since
              Linux 6.1.

       <i>stx_dio_offset_align</i>
              The alignment (in bytes) required for file offsets and I/O
              segment lengths for direct I/O (<b>O_DIRECT</b>) on this file, or
              0 if direct I/O is not supported on this file.  This will
              only be nonzero if <i>stx_dio_mem_align</i> is nonzero, and vice
              versa.

       For further information on the above fields, see <a href="../man7/inode.7.html">inode(7)</a>.

   <b>File attributes</b>
       The <i>stx_attributes</i> field contains a set of ORed flags that
       indicate additional attributes of the file.  Note that any
       attribute that is not indicated as supported by
       <i>stx_attributes_mask</i> has no usable value here.  The bits in
       <i>stx_attributes_mask</i> correspond bit-by-bit to <i>stx_attributes</i>.

       The flags are as follows:

       <b>STATX_ATTR_COMPRESSED</b>
              The file is compressed by the filesystem and may take
              extra resources to access.

       <b>STATX_ATTR_IMMUTABLE</b>
              The file cannot be modified: it cannot be deleted or
              renamed, no hard links can be created to this file and no
              data can be written to it.  See <a href="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr(1)</a>.

       <b>STATX_ATTR_APPEND</b>
              The file can only be opened in append mode for writing.
              Random access writing is not permitted.  See <a href="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr(1)</a>.

       <b>STATX_ATTR_NODUMP</b>
              File is not a candidate for backup when a backup program
              such as <b>dump</b>(8) is run.  See <a href="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr(1)</a>.

       <b>STATX_ATTR_ENCRYPTED</b>
              A key is required for the file to be encrypted by the
              filesystem.

       <b>STATX_ATTR_VERITY </b>(since Linux 5.5)
              The file has fs-verity enabled.  It cannot be written to,
              and all reads from it will be verified against a
              cryptographic hash that covers the entire file (e.g., via
              a Merkle tree).

       <b>STATX_ATTR_DAX </b>(since Linux 5.8)
              The file is in the DAX (cpu direct access) state.  DAX
              state attempts to minimize software cache effects for both
              I/O and memory mappings of this file.  It requires a file
              system which has been configured to support DAX.

              DAX generally assumes all accesses are via CPU load /
              store instructions which can minimize overhead for small
              accesses, but may adversely affect CPU utilization for
              large transfers.

              File I/O is done directly to/from user-space buffers and
              memory mapped I/O may be performed with direct memory
              mappings that bypass the kernel page cache.

              While the DAX property tends to result in data being
              transferred synchronously, it does not give the same
              guarantees as the <b>O_SYNC </b>flag (see <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>), where data
              and the necessary metadata are transferred together.

              A DAX file may support being mapped with the <b>MAP_SYNC</b>
              flag, which enables a program to use CPU cache flush
              instructions to persist CPU store operations without an
              explicit <a href="fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a>.  See <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> for more information.

       <b>STATX_ATTR_MOUNT_ROOT </b>(since Linux 5.8)
              The file is the root of a mount.
