</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>spu_create</b>() system call is used on PowerPC machines that
       implement the Cell Broadband Engine Architecture in order to
       access Synergistic Processor Units (SPUs).  It creates a new
       logical context for an SPU in <i>pathname</i> and returns a file
       descriptor associated with it.  <i>pathname</i> must refer to a
       nonexistent directory in the mount point of the SPU filesystem
       (<b>spufs</b>).  If <b>spu_create</b>() is successful, a directory is created
       at <i>pathname</i> and it is populated with the files described in
       <a href="../man7/spufs.7.html">spufs(7)</a>.

       When a context is created, the returned file descriptor can only
       be passed to <a href="spu_run.2.html">spu_run(2)</a>, used as the <i>dirfd</i> argument to the <b>*at</b>
       family of system calls (e.g., <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a>), or closed; other
       operations are not defined.  A logical SPU context is destroyed
       (along with all files created within the context's <i>pathname</i>
       directory) once the last reference to the context has gone; this
       usually occurs when the file descriptor returned by <b>spu_create</b>()
       is closed.

       The <i>mode</i> argument (minus any bits set in the process's <a href="umask.2.html">umask(2)</a>)
       specifies the permissions used for creating the new directory in
       <b>spufs</b>.  See <a href="stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> for a full list of the possible <i>mode</i> values.

       The <i>neighbor_fd</i> is used only when the <b>SPU_CREATE_AFFINITY_SPU</b>
       flag is specified; see below.

       The <i>flags</i> argument can be zero or any bitwise OR-ed combination
       of the following constants:

       <b>SPU_CREATE_EVENTS_ENABLED</b>
              Rather than using signals for reporting DMA errors, use
              the <i>event</i> argument to <a href="spu_run.2.html">spu_run(2)</a>.

       <b>SPU_CREATE_GANG</b>
              Create an SPU gang instead of a context.  (A gang is a
              group of SPU contexts that are functionally related to
              each other and which share common scheduling parameters—
              priority and policy.  In the future, gang scheduling may
              be implemented causing the group to be switched in and out
              as a single unit.)

              A new directory will be created at the location specified
              by the <i>pathname</i> argument.  This gang may be used to hold
              other SPU contexts, by providing a pathname that is within
              the gang directory to further calls to <b>spu_create</b>().

       <b>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED</b>
              Create a context that is not affected by the SPU
              scheduler.  Once the context is run, it will not be
              scheduled out until it is destroyed by the creating
              process.

              Because the context cannot be removed from the SPU, some
              functionality is disabled for <b>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED </b>contexts.
              Only a subset of the files will be available in this
              context directory in <b>spufs</b>.  Additionally,
              <b>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED </b>contexts cannot dump a core file when
              crashing.

              Creating <b>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED </b>contexts requires the
              <b>CAP_SYS_NICE </b>capability.

       <b>SPU_CREATE_ISOLATE</b>
              Create an isolated SPU context.  Isolated contexts are
              protected from some PPE (PowerPC Processing Element)
              operations, such as access to the SPU local store and the
              NPC register.

              Creating <b>SPU_CREATE_ISOLATE </b>contexts also requires the
              <b>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED </b>flag.

       <b>SPU_CREATE_AFFINITY_SPU </b>(since Linux 2.6.23)
              Create a context with affinity to another SPU context.
              This affinity information is used within the SPU
              scheduling algorithm.  Using this flag requires that a
              file descriptor referring to the other SPU context be
              passed in the <i>neighbor_fd</i> argument.

       <b>SPU_CREATE_AFFINITY_MEM </b>(since Linux 2.6.23)
              Create a context with affinity to system memory.  This
              affinity information is used within the SPU scheduling
              algorithm.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>spu_create</b>() returns a new file descriptor.  On
       failure, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EACCES </b>The current user does not have write access to the
              <a href="../man7/spufs.7.html">spufs(7)</a> mount point.

       <b>EEXIST </b>An SPU context already exists at the given pathname.

       <b>EFAULT </b><i>pathname</i> is not a valid string pointer in the calling
              process's address space.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>pathname</i> is not a directory in the <a href="../man7/spufs.7.html">spufs(7)</a> mount point,
              or invalid flags have been provided.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>Too many symbolic links were found while resolving
              <i>pathname</i>.

       <b>EMFILE </b>The per-process limit on the number of open file
              descriptors has been reached.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              <i>pathname</i> is too long.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
              has been reached.

       <b>ENODEV </b>An isolated context was requested, but the hardware does
              not support SPU isolation.

       <b>ENOENT </b>Part of <i>pathname</i> could not be resolved.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The kernel could not allocate all resources required.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>There are not enough SPU resources available to create a
              new context or the user-specific limit for the number of
              SPU contexts has been reached.

       <b>ENOSYS </b>The functionality is not provided by the current system,
              because either the hardware does not provide SPUs or the
              spufs module is not loaded.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A part of <i>pathname</i> is not a directory.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The <b>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED </b>flag has been given, but the user
              does not have the <b>CAP_SYS_NICE </b>capability.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>pathname</i> must point to a location beneath the mount point of
       <b>spufs</b>.  By convention, it gets mounted in <i>/spu</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux on PowerPC.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 2.6.16.

       Prior to the addition of the <b>SPU_CREATE_AFFINITY_SPU </b>flag in
       Linux 2.6.23, the <b>spu_create</b>() system call took only three
       arguments (i.e., there was no <i>neighbor_fd</i> argument).
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>spu_create</b>() is meant to be used from libraries that implement a
       more abstract interface to SPUs, not to be used from regular
       applications.  See 
       ⟨<a href="http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/">http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/</a>⟩ for the
       recommended libraries.
