NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flock - apply or remove an advisory lock on an open file
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/file.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int flock(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, int </b><i>op</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Apply or remove an advisory lock on the open file specified by
       <i>fd</i>.  The argument <i>op</i> is one of the following:

           <b>LOCK_SH  </b>Place a shared lock.  More than one process may hold
                    a shared lock for a given file at a given time.

           <b>LOCK_EX  </b>Place an exclusive lock.  Only one process may hold
                    an exclusive lock for a given file at a given time.

           <b>LOCK_UN  </b>Remove an existing lock held by this process.

       A call to <b>flock</b>() may block if an incompatible lock is held by
       another process.  To make a nonblocking request, include <b>LOCK_NB</b>
       (by ORing) with any of the above operations.

       A single file may not simultaneously have both shared and
       exclusive locks.

       Locks created by <b>flock</b>() are associated with an open file
       description (see <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>).  This means that duplicate file
       descriptors (created by, for example, <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> or <a href="dup.2.html">dup(2)</a>) refer to
       the same lock, and this lock may be modified or released using
       any of these file descriptors.  Furthermore, the lock is released
       either by an explicit <b>LOCK_UN </b>operation on any of these duplicate
       file descriptors, or when all such file descriptors have been
       closed.

       If a process uses <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a> (or similar) to obtain more than one
       file descriptor for the same file, these file descriptors are
       treated independently by <b>flock</b>().  An attempt to lock the file
       using one of these file descriptors may be denied by a lock that
       the calling process has already placed via another file
       descriptor.

       A process may hold only one type of lock (shared or exclusive) on
       a file.  Subsequent <b>flock</b>() calls on an already locked file will
       convert an existing lock to the new lock mode.

       Locks created by <b>flock</b>() are preserved across an <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       A shared or exclusive lock can be placed on a file regardless of
       the mode in which the file was opened.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
       <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EBADF  </b><i>fd</i> is not an open file descriptor.

       <b>EINTR  </b>While waiting to acquire a lock, the call was interrupted
              by delivery of a signal caught by a handler; see
              <a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal(7)</a>.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>op</i> is invalid.

       <b>ENOLCK </b>The kernel ran out of memory for allocating lock records.

       <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The file is locked and the <b>LOCK_NB </b>flag was selected.
</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Since Linux 2.0, <b>flock</b>() is implemented as a system call in its
       own right rather than being emulated in the GNU C library as a
       call to <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.  With this implementation, there is no
       interaction between the types of lock placed by <b>flock</b>() and
       <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>, and <b>flock</b>() does not detect deadlock.  (Note, however,
       that on some systems, such as the modern BSDs, <b>flock</b>() and
       <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> locks <i>do</i> interact with one another.)

   <b>CIFS details</b>
       Up to Linux 5.4, <b>flock</b>() is not propagated over SMB.  A file with
       such locks will not appear locked for remote clients.

       Since Linux 5.5, <b>flock</b>() locks are emulated with SMB byte-range
       locks on the entire file.  Similarly to NFS, this means that
       <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> and <b>flock</b>() locks interact with one another.  Another
       important side-effect is that the locks are not advisory anymore:
       any IO on a locked file will always fail with <b>EACCES </b>when done
       from a separate file descriptor.  This difference originates from
       the design of locks in the SMB protocol, which provides mandatory
       locking semantics.

       Remote and mandatory locking semantics may vary with SMB
       protocol, mount options and server type.  See <b>mount.cifs</b>(8) for
       additional information.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       BSD.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       4.4BSD (the <b>flock</b>() call first appeared in 4.2BSD).  A version of
       <b>flock</b>(), possibly implemented in terms of <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>, appears on
       most UNIX systems.

   <b>NFS details</b>
       Up to Linux 2.6.11, <b>flock</b>() does not lock files over NFS (i.e.,
       the scope of locks was limited to the local system).  Instead,
       one could use <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> byte-range locking, which does work over
       NFS, given a sufficiently recent version of Linux and a server
       which supports locking.

       Since Linux 2.6.12, NFS clients support <b>flock</b>() locks by
       emulating them as <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> byte-range locks on the entire file.
       This means that <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> and <b>flock</b>() locks <i>do</i> interact with one
       another over NFS.  It also means that in order to place an
       exclusive lock, the file must be opened for writing.

       Since Linux 2.6.37, the kernel supports a compatibility mode that
       allows <b>flock</b>() locks (and also <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> byte region locks) to be
       treated as local; see the discussion of the <i>local_lock</i> option in
       <a href="../man5/nfs.5.html">nfs(5)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>flock</b>() places advisory locks only; given suitable permissions on
       a file, a process is free to ignore the use of <b>flock</b>() and
       perform I/O on the file.

       <b>flock</b>() and <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> locks have different semantics with respect
       to forked processes and <a href="dup.2.html">dup(2)</a>.  On systems that implement
       <b>flock</b>() using <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>, the semantics of <b>flock</b>() will be
       different from those described in this manual page.

       Converting a lock (shared to exclusive, or vice versa) is not
       guaranteed to be atomic: the existing lock is first removed, and
       then a new lock is established.  Between these two steps, a
       pending lock request by another process may be granted, with the
       result that the conversion either blocks, or fails if <b>LOCK_NB </b>was
       specified.  (This is the original BSD behavior, and occurs on
       many other implementations.)
