NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ioctl_xfs_goingdown - shut down an XFS filesystem
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;xfs/xfs_fs.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int ioctl(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, XFS_IOC_GOINGDOWN, uint32_t </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Shuts down a live XFS filesystem.  This is a software initiated
       hard shutdown and should be avoided whenever possible.  After
       this call completes, the filesystem ill be totally unusable until
       the filesystem has been unmounted and remounted.

       <i>flags</i> can be one of the following:

           <b>XFS_FSOP_GOING_FLAGS_DEFAULT</b>
                  Flush all dirty data and metadata to disk, flush
                  pending transactions to the log, and shut down.

           <b>XFS_FSOP_GOING_FLAGS_LOGFLUSH</b>
                  Flush all pending metadata transactions to the log and
                  shut down, leaving all dirty data unwritten.

           <b>XFS_FSOP_GOING_FLAGS_NOLOGFLUSH</b>
                  Shut down immediately, without writing pending
                  transactions or dirty data to disk.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       <b>EFSBADCRC</b>
              Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the
              query.

       <b>EFSCORRUPTED</b>
              Metadata corruption was encountered while performing the
              query.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error was encountered while performing the query.

       <b>EPERM  </b>Caller did not have permission to shut down the
              filesystem.
