SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>void *mremap(void </b><i>old_address</i><b>[.</b><i>old_size</i><b>], size_t </b><i>old_size</i><b>,</b>
                    <b>size_t </b><i>new_size</i><b>, int </b><i>flags</i><b>, ... /* void *</b><i>new_address</i> <b>*/);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mremap</b>() expands (or shrinks) an existing memory mapping,
       potentially moving it at the same time (controlled by the <i>flags</i>
       argument and the available virtual address space).

       <i>old_address</i> is the old address of the virtual memory block that
       you want to expand (or shrink).  Note that <i>old_address</i> has to be
       page aligned.  <i>old_size</i> is the old size of the virtual memory
       block.  <i>new_size</i> is the requested size of the virtual memory
       block after the resize.  An optional fifth argument, <i>new_address</i>,
       may be provided; see the description of <b>MREMAP_FIXED </b>below.

       If the value of <i>old_size</i> is zero, and <i>old_address</i> refers to a
       shareable mapping (see the description of <b>MAP_SHARED </b>in <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>),
       then <b>mremap</b>() will create a new mapping of the same pages.
       <i>new_size</i> will be the size of the new mapping and the location of
       the new mapping may be specified with <i>new_address</i>; see the
       description of <b>MREMAP_FIXED </b>below.  If a new mapping is requested
       via this method, then the <b>MREMAP_MAYMOVE </b>flag must also be
       specified.

       The <i>flags</i> bit-mask argument may be 0, or include the following
       flags:

       <b>MREMAP_MAYMOVE</b>
              By default, if there is not sufficient space to expand a
              mapping at its current location, then <b>mremap</b>() fails.  If
              this flag is specified, then the kernel is permitted to
              relocate the mapping to a new virtual address, if
              necessary.  If the mapping is relocated, then absolute
              pointers into the old mapping location become invalid
              (offsets relative to the starting address of the mapping
              should be employed).

       <b>MREMAP_FIXED </b>(since Linux 2.3.31)
              This flag serves a similar purpose to the <b>MAP_FIXED </b>flag
              of <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>.  If this flag is specified, then <b>mremap</b>()
              accepts a fifth argument, <i>void *new_address</i>, which
              specifies a page-aligned address to which the mapping must
              be moved.  Any previous mapping at the address range
              specified by <i>new_address</i> and <i>new_size</i> is unmapped.

              If <b>MREMAP_FIXED </b>is specified, then <b>MREMAP_MAYMOVE </b>must
              also be specified.

       <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>(since Linux 5.7)
              This flag, which must be used in conjunction with
              <b>MREMAP_MAYMOVE</b>, remaps a mapping to a new address but does
              not unmap the mapping at <i>old_address</i>.

              The <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>flag can be used only with private
              anonymous mappings (see the description of <b>MAP_PRIVATE </b>and
              <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS </b>in <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).

              After completion, any access to the range specified by
              <i>old_address</i> and <i>old_size</i> will result in a page fault.  The
              page fault will be handled by a <a href="userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd(2)</a> handler if
              the address is in a range previously registered with
              <a href="userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd(2)</a>.  Otherwise, the kernel allocates a zero-
              filled page to handle the fault.

              The <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>flag may be used to atomically move a
              mapping while leaving the source mapped.  See NOTES for
              some possible applications of <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP</b>.

       If the memory segment specified by <i>old_address</i> and <i>old_size</i> is
       locked (using <a href="mlock.2.html">mlock(2)</a> or similar), then this lock is maintained
       when the segment is resized and/or relocated.  As a consequence,
       the amount of memory locked by the process may change.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success <b>mremap</b>() returns a pointer to the new virtual memory
       area.  On error, the value <b>MAP_FAILED </b>(that is, <i>(void *) -1</i>) is
       returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EAGAIN </b>The caller tried to expand a memory segment that is
              locked, but this was not possible without exceeding the
              <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK </b>resource limit.

       <b>EFAULT </b>Some address in the range <i>old_address</i> to
              <i>old_address</i>+<i>old_size</i> is an invalid virtual memory address
              for this process.  You can also get <b>EFAULT </b>even if there
              exist mappings that cover the whole address space
              requested, but those mappings are of different types.

       <b>EINVAL </b>An invalid argument was given.  Possible causes are:

              •  <i>old_address</i> was not page aligned;

              •  a value other than <b>MREMAP_MAYMOVE </b>or <b>MREMAP_FIXED </b>or
                 <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>was specified in <i>flags</i>;

              •  <i>new_size</i> was zero;

              •  <i>new_size</i> or <i>new_address</i> was invalid;

              •  the new address range specified by <i>new_address</i> and
                 <i>new_size</i> overlapped the old address range specified by
                 <i>old_address</i> and <i>old_size</i>;

              •  <b>MREMAP_FIXED </b>or <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>was specified without
                 also specifying <b>MREMAP_MAYMOVE</b>;

              •  <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>was specified, but one or more pages
                 in the range specified by <i>old_address</i> and <i>old_size</i> were
                 not private anonymous;

              •  <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>was specified and <i>old_size</i> was not
                 equal to <i>new_size</i>;

              •  <i>old_size</i> was zero and <i>old_address</i> does not refer to a
                 shareable mapping (but see BUGS);

              •  <i>old_size</i> was zero and the <b>MREMAP_MAYMOVE </b>flag was not
                 specified.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Not enough memory was available to complete the operation.
              Possible causes are:

              •  The memory area cannot be expanded at the current
                 virtual address, and the <b>MREMAP_MAYMOVE </b>flag is not set
                 in <i>flags</i>.  Or, there is not enough (virtual) memory
                 available.

              •  <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>was used causing a new mapping to be
                 created that would exceed the (virtual) memory
                 available.  Or, it would exceed the maximum number of
                 allowed mappings.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Prior to glibc 2.4, glibc did not expose the definition of
       <b>MREMAP_FIXED</b>, and the prototype for <b>mremap</b>() did not allow for
       the <i>new_address</i> argument.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mremap</b>() changes the mapping between virtual addresses and memory
       pages.  This can be used to implement a very efficient
       <a href="../man3/realloc.3.html">realloc(3)</a>.

       In Linux, memory is divided into pages.  A process has (one or)
       several linear virtual memory segments.  Each virtual memory
       segment has one or more mappings to real memory pages (in the
       page table).  Each virtual memory segment has its own protection
       (access rights), which may cause a segmentation violation
       (<b>SIGSEGV</b>) if the memory is accessed incorrectly (e.g., writing to
       a read-only segment).  Accessing virtual memory outside of the
       segments will also cause a segmentation violation.

       If <b>mremap</b>() is used to move or expand an area locked with
       <a href="mlock.2.html">mlock(2)</a> or equivalent, the <b>mremap</b>() call will make a best effort
       to populate the new area but will not fail with <b>ENOMEM </b>if the
       area cannot be populated.

   <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP use cases</b>
       Possible applications for <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>include:

       •  Non-cooperative <a href="userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd(2)</a>: an application can yank out a
          virtual address range using <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>and then employ a
          <a href="userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd(2)</a> handler to handle the page faults that
          subsequently occur as other threads in the process touch pages
          in the yanked range.

       •  Garbage collection: <b>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP </b>can be used in
          conjunction with <a href="userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd(2)</a> to implement garbage
          collection algorithms (e.g., in a Java virtual machine).  Such
          an implementation can be cheaper (and simpler) than
          conventional garbage collection techniques that involve
          marking pages with protection <b>PROT_NONE </b>in conjunction with
          the use of a <b>SIGSEGV </b>handler to catch accesses to those pages.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Before Linux 4.14, if <i>old_size</i> was zero and the mapping referred
       to by <i>old_address</i> was a private mapping (see the description of
       <b>MAP_PRIVATE </b>in <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>), <b>mremap</b>() created a new private mapping
       unrelated to the original mapping.  This behavior was unintended
       and probably unexpected in user-space applications (since the
       intention of <b>mremap</b>() is to create a new mapping based on the
       original mapping).  Since Linux 4.14, <b>mremap</b>() fails with the
       error <b>EINVAL </b>in this scenario.
