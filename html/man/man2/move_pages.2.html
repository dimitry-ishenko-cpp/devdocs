SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;numaif.h&gt;</b>

       <b>long move_pages(int </b><i>pid</i><b>, unsigned long </b><i>count</i><b>, void *</b><i>pages</i><b>[.</b><i>count</i><b>],</b>
                       <b>const int </b><i>nodes</i><b>[.</b><i>count</i><b>], int </b><i>status</i><b>[.</b><i>count</i><b>], int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>move_pages</b>() moves the specified <i>pages</i> of the process <i>pid</i> to the
       memory nodes specified by <i>nodes</i>.  The result of the move is
       reflected in <i>status</i>.  The <i>flags</i> indicate constraints on the pages
       to be moved.

       <i>pid</i> is the ID of the process in which pages are to be moved.  If
       <i>pid</i> is 0, then <b>move_pages</b>() moves pages of the calling process.

       To move pages in another process requires the following
       privileges:

       •  Up to and including Linux 4.12: the caller must be privileged
          (<b>CAP_SYS_NICE</b>) or the real or effective user ID of the calling
          process must match the real or saved-set user ID of the target
          process.

       •  The older rules allowed the caller to discover various virtual
          address choices made by the kernel that could lead to the
          defeat of address-space-layout randomization for a process
          owned by the same UID as the caller, the rules were changed
          starting with Linux 4.13.  Since Linux 4.13, permission is
          governed by a ptrace access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_REALCREDS</b>
          check with respect to the target process; see <a href="ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>.

       <i>count</i> is the number of pages to move.  It defines the size of the
       three arrays <i>pages</i>, <i>nodes</i>, and <i>status</i>.

       <i>pages</i> is an array of pointers to the pages that should be moved.
       These are pointers that should be aligned to page boundaries.
       Addresses are specified as seen by the process specified by <i>pid</i>.

       <i>nodes</i> is an array of integers that specify the desired location
       for each page.  Each element in the array is a node number.
       <i>nodes</i> can also be NULL, in which case <b>move_pages</b>() does not move
       any pages but instead will return the node where each page
       currently resides, in the <i>status</i> array.  Obtaining the status of
       each page may be necessary to determine pages that need to be
       moved.

       <i>status</i> is an array of integers that return the status of each
       page.  The array contains valid values only if <b>move_pages</b>() did
       not return an error.  Preinitialization of the array to a value
       which cannot represent a real numa node or valid error of status
       array could help to identify pages that have been migrated.

       <i>flags</i> specify what types of pages to move.  <b>MPOL_MF_MOVE </b>means
       that only pages that are in exclusive use by the process are to
       be moved.  <b>MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL </b>means that pages shared between
       multiple processes can also be moved.  The process must be
       privileged (<b>CAP_SYS_NICE</b>) to use <b>MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL</b>.

   <b>Page states in the status array</b>
       The following values can be returned in each element of the
       <i>status</i> array.

       <b>0..MAX_NUMNODES</b>
              Identifies the node on which the page resides.

       <b>-EACCES</b>
              The page is mapped by multiple processes and can be moved
              only if <b>MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL </b>is specified.

       <b>-EBUSY </b>The page is currently busy and cannot be moved.  Try again
              later.  This occurs if a page is undergoing I/O or another
              kernel subsystem is holding a reference to the page.

       <b>-EFAULT</b>
              This is a zero page or the memory area is not mapped by
              the process.

       <b>-EIO   </b>Unable to write back a page.  The page has to be written
              back in order to move it since the page is dirty and the
              filesystem does not provide a migration function that
              would allow the move of dirty pages.

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
              A dirty page cannot be moved.  The filesystem does not
              provide a migration function and has no ability to write
              back pages.

       <b>-ENOENT</b>
              The page is not present.

       <b>-ENOMEM</b>
              Unable to allocate memory on target node.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success <b>move_pages</b>() returns zero.  On error, it returns -1,
       and sets <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.  If positive value is
       returned, it is the number of nonmigrated pages.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Positive value</b>
              The number of nonmigrated pages if they were the result of
              nonfatal reasons (since Linux 4.17).

       <b>E2BIG  </b>Too many pages to move.  Since Linux 2.6.29, the kernel no
              longer generates this error.

       <b>EACCES </b>One of the target nodes is not allowed by the current
              cpuset.

       <b>EFAULT </b>Parameter array could not be accessed.

       <b>EINVAL </b>Flags other than <b>MPOL_MF_MOVE </b>and <b>MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL </b>was
              specified or an attempt was made to migrate pages of a
              kernel thread.

       <b>ENODEV </b>One of the target nodes is not online.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller specified <b>MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL </b>without sufficient
              privileges (<b>CAP_SYS_NICE</b>).  Or, the caller attempted to
              move pages of a process belonging to another user but did
              not have privilege to do so (<b>CAP_SYS_NICE</b>).

       <b>ESRCH  </b>Process does not exist.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       For information on library support, see <a href="../man7/numa.7.html">numa(7)</a>.

       Use <a href="get_mempolicy.2.html">get_mempolicy(2)</a> with the <b>MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED </b>flag to obtain
       the set of nodes that are allowed by the current cpuset.  Note
       that this information is subject to change at any time by manual
       or automatic reconfiguration of the cpuset.

       Use of this function may result in pages whose location (node)
       violates the memory policy established for the specified
       addresses (See <a href="mbind.2.html">mbind(2)</a>) and/or the specified process (See
       <a href="set_mempolicy.2.html">set_mempolicy(2)</a>).  That is, memory policy does not constrain the
       destination nodes used by <b>move_pages</b>().

       The <i>&lt;numaif.h&gt;</i> header is not included with glibc, but requires
       installing <i>libnuma-devel</i> or a similar package.
