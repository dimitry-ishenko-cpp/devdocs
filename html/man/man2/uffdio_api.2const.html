DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Enable operation of the userfaultfd and perform API handshake.

       The <i>api</i> field denotes the API version requested by the
       application.  The kernel verifies that it can support the
       requested API version, and sets the <i>features</i> and <i>ioctls</i> fields to
       bit masks representing all the available features and the generic
       <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> operations available.

       Since Linux 4.11, applications should use the <i>features</i> field to
       perform a two-step handshake.  First, <b>UFFDIO_API </b>is called with
       the <i>features</i> field set to zero.  The kernel responds by setting
       all supported feature bits.

       Applications which do not require any specific features can begin
       using the userfaultfd immediately.  Applications which do need
       specific features should call <b>UFFDIO_API </b>again with a subset of
       the reported feature bits set to enable those features.

       Before Linux 4.11, the <i>features</i> field must be initialized to zero
       before the call to <b>UFFDIO_API</b>, and zero (i.e., no feature bits)
       is placed in the <i>features</i> field by the kernel upon return from
       <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>.

       If the application sets unsupported feature bits, the kernel will
       zero out the returned <i>uffdio_api</i> structure and return <b>EINVAL</b>.

       The following feature bits may be set:

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_FORK </b>(since Linux 4.11)
              When this feature is enabled, the userfaultfd objects
              associated with a parent process are duplicated into the
              child process during <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and a <b>UFFD_EVENT_FORK </b>event
              is delivered to the userfaultfd monitor

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMAP </b>(since Linux 4.11)
              If this feature is enabled, when the faulting process
              invokes <a href="mremap.2.html">mremap(2)</a>, the userfaultfd monitor will receive an
              event of type <b>UFFD_EVENT_REMAP</b>.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMOVE </b>(since Linux 4.11)
              If this feature is enabled, when the faulting process
              calls <a href="madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a> with the <b>MADV_DONTNEED </b>or <b>MADV_REMOVE</b>
              advice value to free a virtual memory area the userfaultfd
              monitor will receive an event of type <b>UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE</b>.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_UNMAP </b>(since Linux 4.11)
              If this feature is enabled, when the faulting process
              unmaps virtual memory either explicitly with <a href="munmap.2.html">munmap(2)</a>, or
              implicitly during either <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> or <a href="mremap.2.html">mremap(2)</a>, the
              userfaultfd monitor will receive an event of type
              <b>UFFD_EVENT_UNMAP</b>.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_MISSING_HUGETLBFS </b>(since Linux 4.11)
              If this feature bit is set, the kernel supports
              registering userfaultfd ranges on hugetlbfs virtual memory
              areas

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_MISSING_SHMEM </b>(since Linux 4.11)
              If this feature bit is set, the kernel supports
              registering userfaultfd ranges on shared memory areas.
              This includes all kernel shared memory APIs: System V
              shared memory, <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a>, shared mappings of <i>/dev/zero</i>,
              <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> with the <b>MAP_SHARED </b>flag set, <a href="memfd_create.2.html">memfd_create(2)</a>, and
              so on.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_SIGBUS </b>(since Linux 4.14)
              If this feature bit is set, no page-fault events
              (<b>UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT</b>) will be delivered.  Instead, a
              <b>SIGBUS </b>signal will be sent to the faulting process.
              Applications using this feature will not require the use
              of a userfaultfd monitor for processing memory accesses to
              the regions registered with userfaultfd.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_THREAD_ID </b>(since Linux 4.14)
              If this feature bit is set, <i>uffd_msg.pagefault.feat.ptid</i>
              will be set to the faulted thread ID for each page-fault
              message.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP </b>(since Linux 5.10)
              If this feature bit is set, userfaultfd supports write-
              protect faults for anonymous memory.  (Note that shmem /
              hugetlbfs support is indicated by a separate feature.)

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_MINOR_HUGETLBFS </b>(since Linux 5.13)
              If this feature bit is set, the kernel supports
              registering userfaultfd ranges in minor mode on hugetlbfs-
              backed memory areas.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_MINOR_SHMEM </b>(since Linux 5.14)
              If this feature bit is set, the kernel supports
              registering userfaultfd ranges in minor mode on shmem-
              backed memory areas.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_EXACT_ADDRESS </b>(since Linux 5.18)
              If this feature bit is set, <i>uffd_msg.pagefault.address</i>
              will be set to the exact page-fault address that was
              reported by the hardware, and will not mask the offset
              within the page.  Note that old Linux versions might
              indicate the exact address as well, even though the
              feature bit is not set.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_WP_HUGETLBFS_SHMEM </b>(since Linux 5.19)
              If this feature bit is set, userfaultfd supports write-
              protect faults for hugetlbfs and shmem / tmpfs memory.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_WP_UNPOPULATED </b>(since Linux 6.4)
              If this feature bit is set, the kernel will handle
              anonymous memory the same way as file memory, by allowing
              the user to write-protect unpopulated page table entries.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_POISON </b>(since Linux 6.6)
              If this feature bit is set, the kernel supports resolving
              faults with the <b>UFFDIO_POISON </b>ioctl.

       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_WP_ASYNC </b>(since Linux 6.7)
              If this feature bit is set, the write protection faults
              would be asynchronously resolved by the kernel.

       The returned <i>argp-&gt;ioctls</i> field can contain the following bits:

       <b>1 &lt;&lt; _UFFDIO_API</b>
              The <b>UFFDIO_API </b>operation is supported.

       <b>1 &lt;&lt; _UFFDIO_REGISTER</b>
              The <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER </b>operation is supported.

       <b>1 &lt;&lt; _UFFDIO_UNREGISTER</b>
              The <b>UFFDIO_UNREGISTER </b>operation is supported.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, 0 is returned.

       On error, -1 is returned and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EFAULT </b><i>argp</i> refers to an address that is outside the calling
              process's accessible address space.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The API version requested in the <i>api</i> field is not
              supported by this kernel, or the <i>features</i> field passed to
              the kernel includes feature bits that are not supported by
              the current kernel version.

       <b>EINVAL </b>A previous <b>UFFDIO_API </b>call already enabled one or more
              features for this userfaultfd.  Calling <b>UFFDIO_API </b>twice,
              the first time with no features set, is explicitly allowed
              as per the two-step feature detection handshake.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The <b>UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_FORK </b>feature was enabled, but the
              calling process doesn't have the <b>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</b>
              capability.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 4.3.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       If an error occurs, the kernel may zero the provided <i>uffdio_api</i>
       structure.  The caller should treat its contents as unspecified,
       and reinitialize it before re-attempting another <b>UFFDIO_API </b>call.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       In order to detect available userfault features and enable some
       subset of those features the userfaultfd file descriptor must be
       closed after the first <b>UFFDIO_API </b>operation that queries features
       availability and reopened before the second <b>UFFDIO_API </b>operation
       that actually enables the desired features.
