NAME </h2>

       eventfd - create a file descriptor for event notification
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/eventfd.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int eventfd(unsigned int </b><i>initval</i><b>, int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>eventfd</b>() creates an "eventfd object" that can be used as an
       event wait/notify mechanism by user-space applications, and by
       the kernel to notify user-space applications of events.  The
       object contains an unsigned 64-bit integer (<i>uint64_t</i>) counter
       that is maintained by the kernel.  This counter is initialized
       with the value specified in the argument <i>initval</i>.

       As its return value, <b>eventfd</b>() returns a new file descriptor that
       can be used to refer to the eventfd object.

       The following values may be bitwise ORed in <i>flags</i> to change the
       behavior of <b>eventfd</b>():

       <b>EFD_CLOEXEC </b>(since Linux 2.6.27)
              Set the close-on-exec (<b>FD_CLOEXEC</b>) flag on the new file
              descriptor.  See the description of the <b>O_CLOEXEC </b>flag in
              <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a> for reasons why this may be useful.

       <b>EFD_NONBLOCK </b>(since Linux 2.6.27)
              Set the <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>file status flag on the open file
              description (see <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>) referred to by the new file
              descriptor.  Using this flag saves extra calls to <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>
              to achieve the same result.

       <b>EFD_SEMAPHORE </b>(since Linux 2.6.30)
              Provide semaphore-like semantics for reads from the new
              file descriptor.  See below.

       Up to Linux 2.6.26, the <i>flags</i> argument is unused, and must be
       specified as zero.

       The following operations can be performed on the file descriptor
       returned by <b>eventfd</b>():

       <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>
              Each successful <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> returns an 8-byte integer.  A
              <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> fails with the error <b>EINVAL </b>if the size of the
              supplied buffer is less than 8 bytes.

              The value returned by <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> is in host byte order—that
              is, the native byte order for integers on the host
              machine.

              The semantics of <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> depend on whether the eventfd
              counter currently has a nonzero value and whether the
              <b>EFD_SEMAPHORE </b>flag was specified when creating the eventfd
              file descriptor:

              •  If <b>EFD_SEMAPHORE </b>was not specified and the eventfd
                 counter has a nonzero value, then a <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> returns 8
                 bytes containing that value, and the counter's value is
                 reset to zero.

              •  If <b>EFD_SEMAPHORE </b>was specified and the eventfd counter
                 has a nonzero value, then a <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> returns 8 bytes
                 containing the value 1, and the counter's value is
                 decremented by 1.

              •  If the eventfd counter is zero at the time of the call
                 to <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, then the call either blocks until the
                 counter becomes nonzero (at which time, the <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>
                 proceeds as described above) or fails with the error
                 <b>EAGAIN </b>if the file descriptor has been made
                 nonblocking.

       <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>
              A <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> call adds the 8-byte integer value supplied in
              its buffer to the counter.  The maximum value that may be
              stored in the counter is the largest unsigned 64-bit value
              minus 1 (i.e., 0xfffffffffffffffe).  If the addition would
              cause the counter's value to exceed the maximum, then the
              <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> either blocks until a <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> is performed on the
              file descriptor, or fails with the error <b>EAGAIN </b>if the
              file descriptor has been made nonblocking.

              A <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> fails with the error <b>EINVAL </b>if the size of the
              supplied buffer is less than 8 bytes, or if an attempt is
              made to write the value 0xffffffffffffffff.

       <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>
       <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>
       (and similar)
              The returned file descriptor supports <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> (and
              analogously <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>) and <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>, as follows:

              •  The file descriptor is readable (the <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a> <i>readfds</i>
                 argument; the <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> <b>POLLIN </b>flag) if the counter has a
                 value greater than 0.

              •  The file descriptor is writable (the <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a> <i>writefds</i>
                 argument; the <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> <b>POLLOUT </b>flag) if it is possible
                 to write a value of at least "1" without blocking.

              •  If an overflow of the counter value was detected, then
                 <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a> indicates the file descriptor as being both
                 readable and writable, and <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> returns a <b>POLLERR</b>
                 event.  As noted above, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> can never overflow the
                 counter.  However an overflow can occur if 2^64 eventfd
                 "signal posts" were performed by the KAIO subsystem
                 (theoretically possible, but practically unlikely).  If
                 an overflow has occurred, then <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> will return that
                 maximum <i>uint64_t</i> value (i.e., 0xffffffffffffffff).

              The eventfd file descriptor also supports the other file-
              descriptor multiplexing APIs: <a href="pselect.2.html">pselect(2)</a> and <a href="ppoll.2.html">ppoll(2)</a>.

       <a href="close.2.html">close(2)</a>
              When the file descriptor is no longer required it should
              be closed.  When all file descriptors associated with the
              same eventfd object have been closed, the resources for
              object are freed by the kernel.

       A copy of the file descriptor created by <b>eventfd</b>() is inherited
       by the child produced by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.  The duplicate file descriptor
       is associated with the same eventfd object.  File descriptors
       created by <b>eventfd</b>() are preserved across <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, unless the
       close-on-exec flag has been set.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>eventfd</b>() returns a new eventfd file descriptor.  On
       error, -1 is returned and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>

VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>C library/kernel differences</b>
       There are two underlying Linux system calls: <b>eventfd</b>() and the
       more recent <b>eventfd2</b>().  The former system call does not
       implement a <i>flags</i> argument.  The latter system call implements
       the <i>flags</i> values described above.  The glibc wrapper function
       will use <b>eventfd2</b>() where it is available.

   <b>Additional glibc features</b>
       The GNU C library defines an additional type, and two functions
       that attempt to abstract some of the details of reading and
       writing on an eventfd file descriptor:

           typedef uint64_t eventfd_t;

           int eventfd_read(int fd, eventfd_t *value);
           int eventfd_write(int fd, eventfd_t value);

       The functions perform the read and write operations on an eventfd
       file descriptor, returning 0 if the correct number of bytes was
       transferred, or -1 otherwise.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>eventfd</b>()
              Linux 2.6.22, glibc 2.8.

       <b>eventfd2</b>()
              Linux 2.6.27 (see VERSIONS).  Since glibc 2.9, the
              <b>eventfd</b>() wrapper will employ the <b>eventfd2</b>() system call,
              if it is supported by the kernel.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Applications can use an eventfd file descriptor instead of a pipe
       (see <a href="pipe.2.html">pipe(2)</a>) in all cases where a pipe is used simply to signal
       events.  The kernel overhead of an eventfd file descriptor is
       much lower than that of a pipe, and only one file descriptor is
       required (versus the two required for a pipe).

       When used in the kernel, an eventfd file descriptor can provide a
       bridge from kernel to user space, allowing, for example,
       functionalities like KAIO (kernel AIO) to signal to a file
       descriptor that some operation is complete.

       A key point about an eventfd file descriptor is that it can be
       monitored just like any other file descriptor using <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>,
       <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, or <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>.  This means that an application can
       simultaneously monitor the readiness of "traditional" files and
       the readiness of other kernel mechanisms that support the eventfd
       interface.  (Without the <b>eventfd</b>() interface, these mechanisms
       could not be multiplexed via <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, or <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>.)

       The current value of an eventfd counter can be viewed via the
       entry for the corresponding file descriptor in the process's
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fdinfo</i> directory.  See <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> for further details.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following program creates an eventfd file descriptor and then
       forks to create a child process.  While the parent briefly
       sleeps, the child writes each of the integers supplied in the
       program's command-line arguments to the eventfd file descriptor.
       When the parent has finished sleeping, it reads from the eventfd
       file descriptor.

       The following shell session shows a sample run of the program:

           $ <b>./a.out 1 2 4 7 14</b>
           Child writing 1 to efd
           Child writing 2 to efd
           Child writing 4 to efd
           Child writing 7 to efd
           Child writing 14 to efd
           Child completed write loop
           Parent about to read
           Parent read 28 (0x1c) from efd
