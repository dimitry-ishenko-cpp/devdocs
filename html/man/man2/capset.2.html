</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These two system calls are the raw kernel interface for getting
       and setting thread capabilities.  Not only are these system calls
       specific to Linux, but the kernel API is likely to change and use
       of these system calls (in particular the format of the
       <i>cap_user_*_t</i> types) is subject to extension with each kernel
       revision, but old programs will keep working.

       The portable interfaces are <a href="../man3/cap_set_proc.3.html">cap_set_proc(3)</a> and <a href="../man3/cap_get_proc.3.html">cap_get_proc(3)</a>;
       if possible, you should use those interfaces in applications; see
       NOTES.

   <b>Current details</b>
       Now that you have been warned, some current kernel details.  The
       structures are defined as follows.

           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_1  0x19980330
           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_U32S_1     1

                   /* V2 added in Linux 2.6.25; deprecated */
           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_2  0x20071026
           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_U32S_2     2

                   /* V3 added in Linux 2.6.26 */
           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3  0x20080522
           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_U32S_3     2

           typedef struct __user_cap_header_struct {
              __u32 version;
              int pid;
           } *cap_user_header_t;

           typedef struct __user_cap_data_struct {
              __u32 effective;
              __u32 permitted;
              __u32 inheritable;
           } *cap_user_data_t;

       The <i>effective</i>, <i>permitted</i>, and <i>inheritable</i> fields are bit masks of
       the capabilities defined in <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.  Note that the <b>CAP_*</b>
       values are bit indexes and need to be bit-shifted before ORing
       into the bit fields.  To define the structures for passing to the
       system call, you have to use the <i>struct __user_cap_header_struct</i>
       and <i>struct __user_cap_data_struct</i> names because the typedefs are
       only pointers.

       Kernels prior to Linux 2.6.25 prefer 32-bit capabilities with
       version <b>_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_1</b>.  Linux 2.6.25 added 64-bit
       capability sets, with version <b>_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_2</b>.  There
       was, however, an API glitch, and Linux 2.6.26 added
       <b>_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3 </b>to fix the problem.

       Note that 64-bit capabilities use <i>datap[0]</i> and <i>datap[1]</i>, whereas
       32-bit capabilities use only <i>datap[0]</i>.

       On kernels that support file capabilities (VFS capabilities
       support), these system calls behave slightly differently.  This
       support was added as an option in Linux 2.6.24, and became fixed
       (nonoptional) in Linux 2.6.33.

       For <b>capget</b>() calls, one can probe the capabilities of any process
       by specifying its process ID with the <i>hdrp-&gt;pid</i> field value.

       For details on the data, see <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.

   <b>With VFS capabilities support</b>
       VFS capabilities employ a file extended attribute (see <a href="../man7/xattr.7.html">xattr(7)</a>)
       to allow capabilities to be attached to executables.  This
       privilege model obsoletes kernel support for one process
       asynchronously setting the capabilities of another.  That is, on
       kernels that have VFS capabilities support, when calling
       <b>capset</b>(), the only permitted values for <i>hdrp-&gt;pid</i> are 0 or,
       equivalently, the value returned by <a href="gettid.2.html">gettid(2)</a>.

   <b>Without VFS capabilities support</b>
       On older kernels that do not provide VFS capabilities support
       <b>capset</b>() can, if the caller has the <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>capability, be
       used to change not only the caller's own capabilities, but also
       the capabilities of other threads.  The call operates on the
       capabilities of the thread specified by the <i>pid</i> field of <i>hdrp</i>
       when that is nonzero, or on the capabilities of the calling
       thread if <i>pid</i> is 0.  If <i>pid</i> refers to a single-threaded process,
       then <i>pid</i> can be specified as a traditional process ID; operating
       on a thread of a multithreaded process requires a thread ID of
       the type returned by <a href="gettid.2.html">gettid(2)</a>.  For <b>capset</b>(), <i>pid</i> can also be:
       -1, meaning perform the change on all threads except the caller
       and <a href="../man1/init.1.html">init(1)</a>; or a value less than -1, in which case the change is
       applied to all members of the process group whose ID is -<i>pid</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
       <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.

       The calls fail with the error <b>EINVAL</b>, and set the <i>version</i> field
       of <i>hdrp</i> to the kernel preferred value of
       <b>_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_?  </b>when an unsupported <i>version</i> value is
       specified.  In this way, one can probe what the current preferred
       capability revision is.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EFAULT </b>Bad memory address.  <i>hdrp</i> must not be NULL.  <i>datap</i> may be
              NULL only when the user is trying to determine the
              preferred capability version format supported by the
              kernel.

       <b>EINVAL </b>One of the arguments was invalid.

       <b>EPERM  </b>An attempt was made to add a capability to the permitted
              set, or to set a capability in the effective set that is
              not in the permitted set.

       <b>EPERM  </b>An attempt was made to add a capability to the inheritable
              set, and either:

              •  that capability was not in the caller's bounding set;
                 or

              •  the capability was not in the caller's permitted set
                 and the caller lacked the <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>capability in its
                 effective set.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller attempted to use <b>capset</b>() to modify the
              capabilities of a thread other than itself, but lacked
              sufficient privilege.  For kernels supporting VFS
              capabilities, this is never permitted.  For kernels
              lacking VFS support, the <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>capability is
              required.  (A bug in kernels before Linux 2.6.11 meant
              that this error could also occur if a thread without this
              capability tried to change its own capabilities by
              specifying the <i>pid</i> field as a nonzero value (i.e., the
              value returned by <a href="getpid.2.html">getpid(2)</a>) instead of 0.)

       <b>ESRCH  </b>No such thread.
