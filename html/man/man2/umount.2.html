SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/mount.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int umount(const char *</b><i>target</i><b>);</b>
       <b>int umount2(const char *</b><i>target</i><b>, int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>umount</b>() and <b>umount2</b>() remove the attachment of the (topmost)
       filesystem mounted on <i>target</i>.

       Appropriate privilege (Linux: the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability) is
       required to unmount filesystems.

       Linux 2.1.116 added the <b>umount2</b>() system call, which, like
       <b>umount</b>(), unmounts a target, but allows additional <i>flags</i>
       controlling the behavior of the operation:

       <b>MNT_FORCE </b>(since Linux 2.1.116)
              Ask the filesystem to abort pending requests before
              attempting the unmount.  This may allow the unmount to
              complete without waiting for an inaccessible server, but
              could cause data loss.  If, after aborting requests, some
              processes still have active references to the filesystem,
              the unmount will still fail.  As at Linux 4.12, <b>MNT_FORCE</b>
              is supported only on the following filesystems: 9p (since
              Linux 2.6.16), ceph (since Linux 2.6.34), cifs (since
              Linux 2.6.12), fuse (since Linux 2.6.16), lustre (since
              Linux 3.11), and NFS (since Linux 2.1.116).

       <b>MNT_DETACH </b>(since Linux 2.4.11)
              Perform a lazy unmount: make the mount unavailable for new
              accesses, immediately disconnect the filesystem and all
              filesystems mounted below it from each other and from the
              mount table, and actually perform the unmount when the
              mount ceases to be busy.

       <b>MNT_EXPIRE </b>(since Linux 2.6.8)
              Mark the mount as expired.  If a mount is not currently in
              use, then an initial call to <b>umount2</b>() with this flag
              fails with the error <b>EAGAIN</b>, but marks the mount as
              expired.  The mount remains expired as long as it isn't
              accessed by any process.  A second <b>umount2</b>() call
              specifying <b>MNT_EXPIRE </b>unmounts an expired mount.  This
              flag cannot be specified with either <b>MNT_FORCE </b>or
              <b>MNT_DETACH</b>.

       <b>UMOUNT_NOFOLLOW </b>(since Linux 2.6.34)
              Don't dereference <i>target</i> if it is a symbolic link.  This
              flag allows security problems to be avoided in set-user-
              ID-<i>root</i> programs that allow unprivileged users to unmount
              filesystems.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
       <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The error values given below result from filesystem type
       independent errors.  Each filesystem type may have its own
       special errors and its own special behavior.  See the Linux
       kernel source code for details.

       <b>EAGAIN </b>A call to <b>umount2</b>() specifying <b>MNT_EXPIRE </b>successfully
              marked an unbusy filesystem as expired.

       <b>EBUSY  </b><i>target</i> could not be unmounted because it is busy.

       <b>EFAULT </b><i>target</i> points outside the user address space.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>target</i> is not a mount point.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>target</i> is locked; see <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <b>EINVAL umount2</b>() was called with <b>MNT_EXPIRE </b>and either <b>MNT_DETACH</b>
              or <b>MNT_FORCE</b>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>(since Linux 2.6.34)
              <b>umount2</b>() was called with an invalid flag value in <i>flags</i>.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              A pathname was longer than <b>MAXPATHLEN</b>.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A pathname was empty or had a nonexistent component.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The kernel could not allocate a free page to copy
              filenames or data into.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have the required privileges.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>MNT_DETACH </b>and <b>MNT_EXPIRE </b>are available since glibc 2.11.

       The original <b>umount</b>() function was called as <i>umount(device)</i> and
       would return <b>ENOTBLK </b>when called with something other than a
       block device.  In Linux 0.98p4, a call <i>umount(dir)</i> was added, in
       order to support anonymous devices.  In Linux 2.3.99-pre7, the
       call <i>umount(device)</i> was removed, leaving only <i>umount(dir)</i> (since
       now devices can be mounted in more than one place, so specifying
       the device does not suffice).
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>umount() and shared mounts</b>
       Shared mounts cause any mount activity on a mount, including
       <b>umount</b>() operations, to be forwarded to every shared mount in the
       peer group and every slave mount of that peer group.  This means
       that <b>umount</b>() of any peer in a set of shared mounts will cause
       all of its peers to be unmounted and all of their slaves to be
       unmounted as well.

       This propagation of unmount activity can be particularly
       surprising on systems where every mount is shared by default.  On
       such systems, recursively bind mounting the root directory of the
       filesystem onto a subdirectory and then later unmounting that
       subdirectory with <b>MNT_DETACH </b>will cause every mount in the mount
       namespace to be lazily unmounted.

       To ensure <b>umount</b>() does not propagate in this fashion, the mount
       may be remounted using a <a href="mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> call with a <i>mount_flags</i>
       argument that includes both <b>MS_REC </b>and <b>MS_PRIVATE </b>prior to
       <b>umount</b>() being called.
