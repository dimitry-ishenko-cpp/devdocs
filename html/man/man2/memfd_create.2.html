</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>memfd_create</b>() creates an anonymous file and returns a file
       descriptor that refers to it.  The file behaves like a regular
       file, and so can be modified, truncated, memory-mapped, and so
       on.  However, unlike a regular file, it lives in RAM and has a
       volatile backing storage.  Once all references to the file are
       dropped, it is automatically released.  Anonymous memory is used
       for all backing pages of the file.  Therefore, files created by
       <b>memfd_create</b>() have the same semantics as other anonymous memory
       allocations such as those allocated using <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> with the
       <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS </b>flag.

       The initial size of the file is set to 0.  Following the call,
       the file size should be set using <a href="ftruncate.2.html">ftruncate(2)</a>.  (Alternatively,
       the file may be populated by calls to <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> or similar.)

       The name supplied in <i>name</i> is used as a filename and will be
       displayed as the target of the corresponding symbolic link in the
       directory <i>/proc/self/fd/</i>.  The displayed name is always prefixed
       with <i>memfd:</i> and serves only for debugging purposes.  Names do not
       affect the behavior of the file descriptor, and as such multiple
       files can have the same name without any side effects.

       The following values may be bitwise ORed in <i>flags</i> to change the
       behavior of <b>memfd_create</b>():

       <b>MFD_CLOEXEC</b>
              Set the close-on-exec (<b>FD_CLOEXEC</b>) flag on the new file
              descriptor.  See the description of the <b>O_CLOEXEC </b>flag in
              <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a> for reasons why this may be useful.

       <b>MFD_ALLOW_SEALING</b>
              Allow sealing operations on this file.  See the discussion
              of the <b>F_ADD_SEALS </b>and <b>F_GET_SEALS </b>operations in <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>,
              and also NOTES, below.  The initial set of seals is empty.
              If this flag is not set, the initial set of seals will be
              <b>F_SEAL_SEAL</b>, meaning that no other seals can be set on the
              file.

       <b>MFD_HUGETLB </b>(since Linux 4.14)
              The anonymous file will be created in the hugetlbfs
              filesystem using huge pages.  See the Linux kernel source
              file <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.rst</i> for more
              information about hugetlbfs.  Specifying both <b>MFD_HUGETLB</b>
              and <b>MFD_ALLOW_SEALING </b>in <i>flags</i> is supported since Linux
              4.16.

       <b>MFD_HUGE_2MB</b>
       <b>MFD_HUGE_1GB</b>
       ...    Used in conjunction with <b>MFD_HUGETLB </b>to select alternative
              hugetlb page sizes (respectively, 2 MB, 1 GB, ...)  on
              systems that support multiple hugetlb page sizes.
              Definitions for known huge page sizes are included in the
              header file <i>&lt;linux/memfd.h&gt;.</i>

              For details on encoding huge page sizes not included in
              the header file, see the discussion of the similarly named
              constants in <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>.

       Unused bits in <i>flags</i> must be 0.

       As its return value, <b>memfd_create</b>() returns a new file descriptor
       that can be used to refer to the file.  This file descriptor is
       opened for both reading and writing (<b>O_RDWR</b>) and <b>O_LARGEFILE </b>is
       set for the file descriptor.

       With respect to <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, the usual semantics apply
       for the file descriptor created by <b>memfd_create</b>().  A copy of the
       file descriptor is inherited by the child produced by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and
       refers to the same file.  The file descriptor is preserved across
       <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, unless the close-on-exec flag has been set.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>memfd_create</b>() returns a new file descriptor.  On
       error, -1 is returned and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EFAULT </b>The address in <i>name</i> points to invalid memory.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>name</i> was too long.  (The limit is 249 bytes, excluding the
              terminating null byte.)

       <b>EINVAL </b>Both <b>MFD_HUGETLB </b>and <b>MFD_ALLOW_SEALING </b>were specified in

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 3.17, glibc 2.27.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>memfd_create</b>() system call provides a simple alternative to
       manually mounting a <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a> filesystem and creating and opening
       a file in that filesystem.  The primary purpose of <b>memfd_create</b>()
       is to create files and associated file descriptors that are used
       with the file-sealing APIs provided by <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

       The <b>memfd_create</b>() system call also has uses without file sealing
       (which is why file-sealing is disabled, unless explicitly
       requested with the <b>MFD_ALLOW_SEALING </b>flag).  In particular, it
       can be used as an alternative to creating files in <i>tmp</i> or as an
       alternative to using the <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a> <b>O_TMPFILE </b>in cases where there
       is no intention to actually link the resulting file into the
       filesystem.

   <b>File sealing</b>
       In the absence of file sealing, processes that communicate via
       shared memory must either trust each other, or take measures to
       deal with the possibility that an untrusted peer may manipulate
       the shared memory region in problematic ways.  For example, an
       untrusted peer might modify the contents of the shared memory at
       any time, or shrink the shared memory region.  The former
       possibility leaves the local process vulnerable to time-of-check-
       to-time-of-use race conditions (typically dealt with by copying
       data from the shared memory region before checking and using it).
       The latter possibility leaves the local process vulnerable to
       <b>SIGBUS </b>signals when an attempt is made to access a now-
       nonexistent location in the shared memory region.  (Dealing with
       this possibility necessitates the use of a handler for the <b>SIGBUS</b>
       signal.)

       Dealing with untrusted peers imposes extra complexity on code
       that employs shared memory.  Memory sealing enables that extra
       complexity to be eliminated, by allowing a process to operate
       secure in the knowledge that its peer can't modify the shared
       memory in an undesired fashion.

       An example of the usage of the sealing mechanism is as follows:

       (1)  The first process creates a <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a> file using
            <b>memfd_create</b>().  The call yields a file descriptor used in
            subsequent steps.

       (2)  The first process sizes the file created in the previous
            step using <a href="ftruncate.2.html">ftruncate(2)</a>, maps it using <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>, and
            populates the shared memory with the desired data.

       (3)  The first process uses the <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> <b>F_ADD_SEALS </b>operation to
            place one or more seals on the file, in order to restrict
            further modifications on the file.  (If placing the seal
            <b>F_SEAL_WRITE</b>, then it will be necessary to first unmap the
            shared writable mapping created in the previous step.
            Otherwise, behavior similar to <b>F_SEAL_WRITE </b>can be achieved
            by using <b>F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE</b>, which will prevent future
            writes via <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> and <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> from succeeding while
            keeping existing shared writable mappings).

       (4)  A second process obtains a file descriptor for the <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a>
            file and maps it.  Among the possible ways in which this
            could happen are the following:

            •  The process that called <b>memfd_create</b>() could transfer the
               resulting file descriptor to the second process via a
               UNIX domain socket (see <a href="../man7/unix.7.html">unix(7)</a> and <a href="../man3/cmsg.3.html">cmsg(3)</a>).  The second
               process then maps the file using <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>.

            •  The second process is created via <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and thus
               automatically inherits the file descriptor and mapping.
               (Note that in this case and the next, there is a natural
               trust relationship between the two processes, since they
               are running under the same user ID.  Therefore, file
               sealing would not normally be necessary.)

            •  The second process opens the file <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd/</i>fd, where
               <i>&lt;pid&gt;</i> is the PID of the first process (the one that
               called <b>memfd_create</b>()), and <i>&lt;fd&gt;</i> is the number of the
               file descriptor returned by the call to <b>memfd_create</b>() in
               that process.  The second process then maps the file
               using <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>.

       (5)  The second process uses the <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> <b>F_GET_SEALS </b>operation
            to retrieve the bit mask of seals that has been applied to
            the file.  This bit mask can be inspected in order to
            determine what kinds of restrictions have been placed on
            file modifications.  If desired, the second process can
            apply further seals to impose additional restrictions (so
            long as the <b>F_SEAL_SEAL </b>seal has not yet been applied).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Below are shown two example programs that demonstrate the use of
       <b>memfd_create</b>() and the file sealing API.

       The first program, <i>t_memfd_create.c</i>, creates a <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a> file
       using <b>memfd_create</b>(), sets a size for the file, maps it into
       memory, and optionally places some seals on the file.  The
       program accepts up to three command-line arguments, of which the
       first two are required.  The first argument is the name to
       associate with the file, the second argument is the size to be
       set for the file, and the optional third argument is a string of
       characters that specify seals to be set on the file.

       The second program, <i>t_get_seals.c</i>, can be used to open an
       existing file that was created via <b>memfd_create</b>() and inspect the
       set of seals that have been applied to that file.

       The following shell session demonstrates the use of these
       programs.  First we create a <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a> file and set some seals on
       it:

           $ <b>./t_memfd_create my_memfd_file 4096 sw &amp;</b>
           [1] 11775
           PID: 11775; fd: 3; /proc/11775/fd/3

       At this point, the <i>t_memfd_create</i> program continues to run in the
       background.  From another program, we can obtain a file
       descriptor for the file created by <b>memfd_create</b>() by opening the
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd</i> file that corresponds to the file descriptor opened
       by <b>memfd_create</b>().  Using that pathname, we inspect the content
       of the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd</i> symbolic link, and use our <i>t_get_seals</i>
       program to view the seals that have been placed on the file:

           $ <b>readlink /proc/11775/fd/3</b>
           /memfd:my_memfd_file (deleted)
           $ <b>./t_get_seals /proc/11775/fd/3</b>
           Existing seals: WRITE SHRINK
