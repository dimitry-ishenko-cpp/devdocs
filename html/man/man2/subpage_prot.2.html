</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       subpage_prot - define a subpage protection for an address range
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;      </b>/* Definition of <b>SYS_* </b>constants */
       <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int syscall(SYS_subpage_prot, unsigned long </b><i>addr</i><b>, unsigned long </b><i>len</i><b>,</b>
                   <b>uint32_t *</b><i>map</i><b>);</b>

       <i>Note</i>: glibc provides no wrapper for <b>subpage_prot</b>(), necessitating
       the use of <a href="syscall.2.html">syscall(2)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The PowerPC-specific <b>subpage_prot</b>() system call provides the
       facility to control the access permissions on individual 4 kB
       subpages on systems configured with a page size of 64 kB.

       The protection map is applied to the memory pages in the region
       starting at <i>addr</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes.  Both of these
       arguments must be aligned to a 64-kB boundary.

       The protection map is specified in the buffer pointed to by <i>map</i>.
       The map has 2 bits per 4 kB subpage; thus each 32-bit word
       specifies the protections of 16 4 kB subpages inside a 64 kB page
       (so, the number of 32-bit words pointed to by <i>map</i> should equate
       to the number of 64-kB pages specified by <i>len</i>).  Each 2-bit field
       in the protection map is either 0 to allow any access, 1 to
       prevent writes, or 2 or 3 to prevent all accesses.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>subpage_prot</b>() returns 0.  Otherwise, one of the
       error codes specified below is returned.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EFAULT </b>The buffer referred to by <i>map</i> is not accessible.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>addr</i> or <i>len</i> arguments are incorrect.  Both of these
              arguments must be aligned to a multiple of the system page
              size, and they must not refer to a region outside of the
              address space of the process or to a region that consists
              of huge pages.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Out of memory.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 2.6.25 (PowerPC).

       The system call is provided only if the kernel is configured with
       <b>CONFIG_PPC_64K_PAGES</b>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Normal page protections (at the 64-kB page level) also apply; the
       subpage protection mechanism is an additional constraint, so
       putting 0 in a 2-bit field won't allow writes to a page that is
       otherwise write-protected.

   <b>Rationale</b>
       This system call is provided to assist writing emulators that
       operate using 64-kB pages on PowerPC systems.  When emulating
       systems such as x86, which uses a smaller page size, the emulator
       can no longer use the memory-management unit (MMU) and normal
       system calls for controlling page protections.  (The emulator
       could emulate the MMU by checking and possibly remapping the
       address for each memory access in software, but that is slow.)
       The idea is that the emulator supplies an array of protection
       masks to apply to a specified range of virtual addresses.  These
       masks are applied at the level where hardware page-table entries
       (PTEs) are inserted into the hardware page table based on the
       Linux PTEs, so the Linux PTEs are not affected.  Implicit in this
       is that the regions of the address space that are protected are
       switched to use 4-kB hardware pages rather than 64-kB hardware
       pages (on machines with hardware 64-kB page support).
