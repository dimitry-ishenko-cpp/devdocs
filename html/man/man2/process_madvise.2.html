NAME </h2>
<pre>
       process_madvise - give advice about use of memory to a process
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</b>

       <b>ssize_t process_madvise(int </b><i>pidfd</i><b>, const struct iovec </b><i>iovec</i><b>[.</b><i>n</i><b>],</b>
                               <b>size_t </b><i>n</i><b>, int </b><i>advice</i><b>, unsigned int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>process_madvise</b>() system call is used to give advice or
       directions to the kernel about the address ranges of another
       process or of the calling process.  It provides the advice for
       the address ranges described by <i>iovec</i> and <i>n</i>.  The goal of such
       advice is to improve system or application performance.

       The <i>pidfd</i> argument is a PID file descriptor (see <a href="pidfd_open.2.html">pidfd_open(2)</a>)
       that specifies the process to which the advice is to be applied.

       The pointer <i>iovec</i> points to an array of <i>iovec</i> structures,
       described in <a href="../man3/iovec.3type.html">iovec(3type)</a>.

       <i>n</i> specifies the number of elements in the array of <i>iovec</i>
       structures.  This value must be less than or equal to <b>IOV_MAX</b>
       (defined in <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> or accessible via the call
       <i>sysconf(_SC_IOV_MAX)</i>).

       The <i>advice</i> argument is one of the following values:

       <b>MADV_COLD</b>
              See <a href="madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a>.

       <b>MADV_COLLAPSE</b>
              See <a href="madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a>.

       <b>MADV_PAGEOUT</b>
              See <a href="madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a>.

       <b>MADV_WILLNEED</b>
              See <a href="madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a>.

       The <i>flags</i> argument is reserved for future use; currently, this
       argument must be specified as 0.

       The <i>n</i> and <i>iovec</i> arguments are checked before applying any advice.
       If <i>n</i> is too big, or <i>iovec</i> is invalid, then an error will be
       returned immediately and no advice will be applied.

       The advice might be applied to only a part of <i>iovec</i> if one of its
       elements points to an invalid memory region in the remote
       process.  No further elements will be processed beyond that
       point.  (See the discussion regarding partial advice in RETURN
       VALUE.)

       Starting in Linux 5.12, permission to apply advice to another
       process is governed by ptrace access mode
       <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS </b>check (see <a href="ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>); in addition,
       because of the performance implications of applying the advice,
       the caller must have the <b>CAP_SYS_NICE </b>capability (see
       <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>).
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>process_madvise</b>() returns the number of bytes
       advised.  This return value may be less than the total number of
       requested bytes, if an error occurred after some <i>iovec</i> elements
       were already processed.  The caller should check the return value
       to determine whether a partial advice occurred.

       On error, -1 is returned and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EBADF  </b><i>pidfd</i> is not a valid PID file descriptor.

       <b>EFAULT </b>The memory described by <i>iovec</i> is outside the accessible
              address space of the process referred to by <i>pidfd</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>flags</i> is not 0.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The sum of the <i>iov_len</i> values of <i>iovec</i> overflows a <i>ssize_t</i>
              value.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>n</i> is too large.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Could not allocate memory for internal copies of the <i>iovec</i>
              structures.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have permission to access the address
              space of the process <i>pidfd</i>.

       <b>ESRCH  </b>The target process does not exist (i.e., it has terminated
              and been waited on).

       See <a href="madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a> for <i>advice</i>-specific errors.

STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 5.10.  glibc 2.36.

       Support for this system call is optional, depending on the
       setting of the <b>CONFIG_ADVISE_SYSCALLS </b>configuration option.

       When this system call first appeared in Linux 5.10, permission to
       apply advice to another process was entirely governed by ptrace
       access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS </b>check (see <a href="ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>).
       This requirement was relaxed in Linux 5.12 so that the caller
       didn't require full control over the target process.
