       <b>#include &lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</b>

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Query or set additional attributes associated with files in
       various file systems.  The attributes are conveyed in a structure
       of the form:

           struct fsxattr {
                __u32         fsx_xflags;
                __u32         fsx_extsize;
                __u32         fsx_nextents;
                __u32         fsx_projid;
                __u32         fsx_cowextsize;
                unsigned char fsx_pad[8];
           };

       <i>fsx_xflags</i> are extended flags that apply to this file.  Refer to
       the section <b>XFS INODE FLAGS </b>below for more information.

       <i>fsx_extsize</i> is the preferred extent allocation size for data
       blocks mapped to this file, in units of filesystem blocks.  If
       this value is zero, the filesystem will choose a default option,
       which is currently zero.  If <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR </b>is called with
       <b>XFS_XFLAG_EXTSIZE </b>set in <i>fsx_xflags</i> and this field set to zero,
       the XFLAG will also be cleared.

       <i>fsx_nextents</i> is the number of data extents in this file.  If
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTRA </b>was used, then this is the number of extended
       attribute extents in the file.

       <i>fsx_projid</i> is the project ID of this file.

       <i>fsx_cowextsize</i> is the preferred extent allocation size for copy
       on write operations targeting this file, in units of filesystem
       blocks.  If this field is zero, the filesystem will choose a
       default option, which is currently 128 filesystem blocks.  If
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR </b>is called with <b>XFS_XFLAG_COWEXTSIZE </b>set in
       <i>fsx_xflags</i> and this field set to zero, the XFLAG will also be
       cleared.

       <i>fsx_pad</i> must be zeroed.
</pre> <h2>
XFS INODE FLAGS </h2>
<pre>
       This field can be a combination of the following:

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_REALTIME</b>
              The file is a realtime file.  This bit can only be changed
              on a file when it has no allocated extents.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_PREALLOC</b>
              The file has preallocated space.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_IMMUTABLE</b>
              The file is immutable - it cannot be modified, deleted or
              renamed, no link can be created to this file and no data
              can be written to the file.  Only the superuser or a
              process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can
              set or clear this flag.  If this flag is set before a
              <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR </b>call and would not be cleared by the
              call, then no other attributes can be changed and <b>EPERM</b>
              will be returned.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_APPEND</b>
              The file is append-only - it can only be opened in append
              mode for writing.  For directories, this means that files
              cannot be unlinked from this directory.  Only the
              superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE
              capability can set or clear this flag.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_SYNC</b>
              All writes to the file are synchronous.  If set on a
              directory and the <b>/proc/sys/fs/xfs/inherit_sync </b>tunable is
              set to 1, new files and subdirectories created in the
              directory will also have the flag set.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_NOATIME</b>
              When the file is accessed, its atime record is not
              modified.  If set on a directory and the
              <b>/proc/sys/fs/xfs/inherit_noatime </b>tunable is set to 1, new
              files and subdirectories created in the directory will
              also have the flag set.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_NODUMP</b>
              The file should be skipped by backup utilities.  If set on
              a directory and the <b>/proc/sys/fs/xfs/inherit_nodump</b>
              tunable is set to 1, new files and subdirectories created
              in the directory will also have the flag set.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT</b>
              Realtime inheritance bit - new files created in the
              directory will be automatically created as realtime files.
              If set on a directory, new subdirectories created in the
              directory will also have the inheritance flag set.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_PROJINHERIT</b>
              Project inheritance bit - new files and directories
              created in this directory will inherit the project ID of
              this directory.  If set on a directory, new subdirectories
              created in the directory will also have the inheritance
              flag set.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_NOSYMLINKS</b>
              Disallows creation of symbolic links in the directory.
              This flag can only be set on a directory.  If set on a
              directory and the <b>/proc/sys/fs/xfs/inherit_nosymlinks</b>
              tunable is set to 1, new files and subdirectories created
              in the directory will also have the flag set.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_EXTSIZE</b>
              Extent size bit - if a basic extent size value is set on
              the file then the allocator will allocate in multiples of
              the set size for this file (see <b>fsx_extsize </b>below).  The
              extent size can only be changed on a file when it has no
              allocated extents.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_EXTSZINHERIT</b>
              Extent size inheritance bit - new files and directories
              created in the directory will inherit the extent size
              value (see <b>fsx_extsize </b>below) of the parent directory.
              New subdirectories created in the directory will inherit
              the extent size inheritance bit.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_NODEFRAG</b>
              No defragment file bit - the file should be skipped during
              a defragmentation operation.  If set on a directory and
              the <b>/proc/sys/fs/xfs/inherit_nodefrag </b>tunable is set to 1,
              new files and subdirectories created in the directory will
              also have the flag set.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_FILESTREAM</b>
              Filestream allocator bit - allows a directory to reserve
              an allocation group for exclusive use by files created
              within that directory.  Files being written in other
              directories will not use the same allocation group and so
              files within different directories will not interleave
              extents on disk.  The reservation is only active while
              files are being created and written into the directory.
              If set on a directory, new files and subdirectories
              created in the directory will also have the flag set.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_DAX</b>
              If the filesystem lives on directly accessible persistent
              memory, reads and writes to this file will go straight to
              the persistent memory, bypassing the page cache.  If set
              on a directory, new files and subdirectories created in
              the directory will also have the flag set.  This flag
              cannot be set on filesystems which have the reflink
              feature enabled.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_COWEXTSIZE</b>
              Copy on Write Extent size bit - if a CoW extent size value
              is set on the file, the allocator will allocate extents
              for staging a copy on write operation in multiples of the
              set size for this file (see <b>fsx_cowextsize </b>below).  If set
              on a directory, new files and subdirectories created in
              the directory will have both the flag and the CoW extent
              size value set.

       <b>XFS_XFLAG_HASATTR</b>
              The file has extended attributes associated with it.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
