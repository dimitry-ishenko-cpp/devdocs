       <i>Note</i>: glibc provides no wrapper for <b>openat2</b>(), necessitating the
       use of <a href="syscall.2.html">syscall(2)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>openat2</b>() system call is an extension of <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a> and
       provides a superset of its functionality.

       The <b>openat2</b>() system call opens the file specified by <i>pathname</i>.
       If the specified file does not exist, it may optionally (if
       <b>O_CREAT </b>is specified in <i>how.flags</i>) be created.

       As with <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a>, if <i>pathname</i> is a relative pathname, then it is
       interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file
       descriptor <i>dirfd</i> (or the current working directory of the calling
       process, if <i>dirfd</i> is the special value <b>AT_FDCWD</b>).  If <i>pathname</i> is
       an absolute pathname, then <i>dirfd</i> is ignored (unless <i>how.resolve</i>
       contains <b>RESOLVE_IN_ROOT</b>, in which case <i>pathname</i> is resolved
       relative to <i>dirfd</i>).

       Rather than taking a single <i>flags</i> argument, an extensible
       structure (<i>how</i>) is passed to allow for future extensions.  The
       <i>size</i> argument must be specified as <i>sizeof(struct open_how)</i>.

   <b>The open_how structure</b>
       The <i>how</i> argument specifies how <i>pathname</i> should be opened, and
       acts as a superset of the <i>flags</i> and <i>mode</i> arguments to <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a>.
       This argument is a pointer to an <i>open_how</i> structure, described in
       <a href="open_how.2type.html">open_how(2type)</a>.

       Any future extensions to <b>openat2</b>() will be implemented as new
       fields appended to the <i>open_how</i> structure, with a zero value in a
       new field resulting in the kernel behaving as though that
       extension field was not present.  Therefore, the caller <i>must</i>
       zero-fill this structure on initialization.  (See the
       "Extensibility" section of the <b>NOTES </b>for more detail on why this
       is necessary.)

       The fields of the <i>open_how</i> structure are as follows:

       <i>flags</i>  This field specifies the file creation and file status
              flags to use when opening the file.  All of the <b>O_* </b>flags
              defined for <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a> are valid <b>openat2</b>() flag values.

              Whereas <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a> ignores unknown bits in its <i>flags</i>
              argument, <b>openat2</b>() returns an error if unknown or
              conflicting flags are specified in <i>how.flags</i>.

       <i>mode</i>   This field specifies the mode for the new file, with
              identical semantics to the <i>mode</i> argument of <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a>.

              Whereas <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a> ignores bits other than those in the
              range <i>07777</i> in its <i>mode</i> argument, <b>openat2</b>() returns an
              error if <i>how.mode</i> contains bits other than <i>07777</i>.
              Similarly, an error is returned if <b>openat2</b>() is called
              with a nonzero <i>how.mode</i> and <i>how.flags</i> does not contain
              <b>O_CREAT </b>or <b>O_TMPFILE</b>.

       <i>resolve</i>
              This is a bit-mask of flags that modify the way in which
              <b>all </b>components of <i>pathname</i> will be resolved.  (See
              <a href="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution(7)</a> for background information.)

              The primary use case for these flags is to allow trusted
              programs to restrict how untrusted paths (or paths inside
              untrusted directories) are resolved.  The full list of
              <i>resolve</i> flags is as follows:

              <b>RESOLVE_BENEATH</b>
                     Do not permit the path resolution to succeed if any
                     component of the resolution is not a descendant of
                     the directory indicated by <i>dirfd</i>.  This causes
                     absolute symbolic links (and absolute values of
                     <i>pathname</i>) to be rejected.

                     Currently, this flag also disables magic-link
                     resolution (see below).  However, this may change
                     in the future.  Therefore, to ensure that magic
                     links are not resolved, the caller should
                     explicitly specify <b>RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS</b>.

              <b>RESOLVE_IN_ROOT</b>
                     Treat the directory referred to by <i>dirfd</i> as the
                     root directory while resolving <i>pathname</i>.  Absolute
                     symbolic links are interpreted relative to <i>dirfd</i>.
                     If a prefix component of <i>pathname</i> equates to <i>dirfd</i>,
                     then an immediately following <i>..</i> component likewise
                     equates to <i>dirfd</i> (just as <i>/..</i> is traditionally
                     equivalent to <i>/</i>).  If <i>pathname</i> is an absolute path,
                     it is also interpreted relative to <i>dirfd</i>.

                     The effect of this flag is as though the calling
                     process had used <a href="chroot.2.html">chroot(2)</a> to (temporarily) modify
                     its root directory (to the directory referred to by
                     <i>dirfd</i>).  However, unlike <a href="chroot.2.html">chroot(2)</a> (which changes
                     the filesystem root permanently for a process),
                     <b>RESOLVE_IN_ROOT </b>allows a program to efficiently
                     restrict path resolution on a per-open basis.

                     Currently, this flag also disables magic-link
                     resolution.  However, this may change in the
                     future.  Therefore, to ensure that magic links are
                     not resolved, the caller should explicitly specify
                     <b>RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS</b>.

              <b>RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS</b>
                     Disallow all magic-link resolution during path
                     resolution.

                     Magic links are symbolic link-like objects that are
                     most notably found in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>; examples include
                     <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/exe</i> and <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd/*</i>.  (See <a href="../man7/symlink.7.html">symlink(7)</a>
                     for more details.)

                     Unknowingly opening magic links can be risky for
                     some applications.  Examples of such risks include
                     the following:

                     •  If the process opening a pathname is a
                        controlling process that currently has no
                        controlling terminal (see <a href="../man7/credentials.7.html">credentials(7)</a>), then
                        opening a magic link inside <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd</i> that
                        happens to refer to a terminal would cause the
                        process to acquire a controlling terminal.

                     •  In a containerized environment, a magic link
                        inside <i>/proc</i> may refer to an object outside the
                        container, and thus may provide a means to
                        escape from the container.

                     Because of such risks, an application may prefer to
                     disable magic link resolution using the
                     <b>RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS </b>flag.

                     If the trailing component (i.e., basename) of
                     <i>pathname</i> is a magic link, <i>how.resolve</i> contains
                     <b>RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS</b>, and <i>how.flags</i> contains both
                     <b>O_PATH </b>and <b>O_NOFOLLOW</b>, then an <b>O_PATH </b>file
                     descriptor referencing the magic link will be
                     returned.

              <b>RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS</b>
                     Disallow resolution of symbolic links during path
                     resolution.  This option implies
                     <b>RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS</b>.

                     If the trailing component (i.e., basename) of
                     <i>pathname</i> is a symbolic link, <i>how.resolve</i> contains
                     <b>RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS</b>, and <i>how.flags</i> contains both
                     <b>O_PATH </b>and <b>O_NOFOLLOW</b>, then an <b>O_PATH </b>file
                     descriptor referencing the symbolic link will be
                     returned.

                     Note that the effect of the <b>RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS</b>
                     flag, which affects the treatment of symbolic links
                     in all of the components of <i>pathname</i>, differs from
                     the effect of the <b>O_NOFOLLOW </b>file creation flag (in
                     <i>how.flags</i>), which affects the handling of symbolic
                     links only in the final component of <i>pathname</i>.

                     Applications that employ the <b>RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS</b>
                     flag are encouraged to make its use configurable
                     (unless it is used for a specific security
                     purpose), as symbolic links are very widely used by
                     end-users.  Setting this flag indiscriminately—
                     i.e., for purposes not specifically related to
                     security—for all uses of <b>openat2</b>() may result in
                     spurious errors on previously functional systems.
                     This may occur if, for example, a system pathname
                     that is used by an application is modified (e.g.,
                     in a new distribution release) so that a pathname
                     component (now) contains a symbolic link.

              <b>RESOLVE_NO_XDEV</b>
                     Disallow traversal of mount points during path
                     resolution (including all bind mounts).
                     Consequently, <i>pathname</i> must either be on the same
                     mount as the directory referred to by <i>dirfd</i>, or on
                     the same mount as the current working directory if
                     <i>dirfd</i> is specified as <b>AT_FDCWD</b>.

                     Applications that employ the <b>RESOLVE_NO_XDEV </b>flag
                     are encouraged to make its use configurable (unless
                     it is used for a specific security purpose), as
                     bind mounts are widely used by end-users.  Setting
                     this flag indiscriminately—i.e., for purposes not
                     specifically related to security—for all uses of
                     <b>openat2</b>() may result in spurious errors on
                     previously functional systems.  This may occur if,
                     for example, a system pathname that is used by an
                     application is modified (e.g., in a new
                     distribution release) so that a pathname component
                     (now) contains a bind mount.

              <b>RESOLVE_CACHED</b>
                     Make the open operation fail unless all path
                     components are already present in the kernel's
                     lookup cache.  If any kind of revalidation or I/O
                     is needed to satisfy the lookup, <b>openat2</b>() fails
                     with the error <b>EAGAIN</b>.  This is useful in providing
                     a fast-path open that can be performed without
                     resorting to thread offload, or other mechanisms
                     that an application might use to offload slower
                     operations.

              If any bits other than those listed above are set in
              <i>how.resolve</i>, an error is returned.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, a new file descriptor is returned.  On error, -1 is
       returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The set of errors returned by <b>openat2</b>() includes all of the
       errors returned by <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a>, as well as the following additional
       errors:

       <b>E2BIG  </b>An extension that this kernel does not support was
              specified in <i>how</i>.  (See the "Extensibility" section of
              <b>NOTES </b>for more detail on how extensions are handled.)

       <b>EAGAIN </b><i>how.resolve</i> contains either <b>RESOLVE_IN_ROOT </b>or
              <b>RESOLVE_BENEATH</b>, and the kernel could not ensure that a
              ".." component didn't escape (due to a race condition or
              potential attack).  The caller may choose to retry the
              <b>openat2</b>() call.

       <b>EAGAIN RESOLVE_CACHED </b>was set, and the open operation cannot be
              performed using only cached information.  The caller
              should retry without <b>RESOLVE_CACHED </b>set in <i>how.resolve</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>An unknown flag or invalid value was specified in <i>how</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>mode</i> is nonzero, but <i>how.flags</i> does not contain <b>O_CREAT </b>or
              <b>O_TMPFILE</b>.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>size</i> was smaller than any known version of <i>struct</i>
              <i>open_how</i>.

       <b>ELOOP  </b><i>how.resolve</i> contains <b>RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS</b>, and one of the

       <b>ELOOP  </b><i>how.resolve</i> contains <b>RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS</b>, and one of the

       <b>EXDEV  </b><i>how.resolve</i> contains either <b>RESOLVE_IN_ROOT </b>or
              <b>RESOLVE_BENEATH</b>, and an escape from the root during path

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Extensibility</b>
       In order to allow for future extensibility, <b>openat2</b>() requires
       the user-space application to specify the size of the <i>open_how</i>
       structure that it is passing.  By providing this information, it
       is possible for <b>openat2</b>() to provide both forwards- and
       backwards-compatibility, with <i>size</i> acting as an implicit version
       number.  (Because new extension fields will always be appended,
       the structure size will always increase.)  This extensibility
       design is very similar to other system calls such as
       <a href="sched_setattr.2.html">sched_setattr(2)</a>, <a href="perf_event_open.2.html">perf_event_open(2)</a>, and <a href="clone3.2.html">clone3(2)</a>.

       If we let <i>usize</i> be the size of the structure as specified by the
       user-space application, and <i>ksize</i> be the size of the structure
       which the kernel supports, then there are three cases to
       consider:

       •  If <i>ksize</i> equals <i>usize</i>, then there is no version mismatch and
          <i>how</i> can be used verbatim.

       •  If <i>ksize</i> is larger than <i>usize</i>, then there are some extension
          fields that the kernel supports which the user-space
          application is unaware of.  Because a zero value in any added
          extension field signifies a no-op, the kernel treats all of
          the extension fields not provided by the user-space
          application as having zero values.  This provides backwards-
          compatibility.

       •  If <i>ksize</i> is smaller than <i>usize</i>, then there are some extension
          fields which the user-space application is aware of but which
          the kernel does not support.  Because any extension field must
          have its zero values signify a no-op, the kernel can safely
          ignore the unsupported extension fields if they are all-zero.
          If any unsupported extension fields are nonzero, then -1 is
          returned and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to <b>E2BIG</b>.  This provides forwards-
          compatibility.

       Because the definition of <i>struct open_how</i> may change in the
       future (with new fields being added when system headers are
       updated), user-space applications should zero-fill <i>struct</i>
       <i>open_how</i> to ensure that recompiling the program with new headers
       will not result in spurious errors at run time.  The simplest way
       is to use a designated initializer:

           struct open_how how = { .flags = O_RDWR,
                                   .resolve = RESOLVE_IN_ROOT };

       or explicitly using <a href="../man3/memset.3.html">memset(3)</a> or similar:

           struct open_how how;
           memset(&amp;how, 0, sizeof(how));
           how.flags = O_RDWR;
           how.resolve = RESOLVE_IN_ROOT;

       A user-space application that wishes to determine which
       extensions the running kernel supports can do so by conducting a
       binary search on <i>size</i> with a structure which has every byte
       nonzero (to find the largest value which doesn't produce an error
       of <b>E2BIG</b>).
