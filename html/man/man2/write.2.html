NAME </h2>
<pre>
       write - write to a file descriptor
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b>

       <b>ssize_t write(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, const void </b><i>buf</i><b>[.</b><i>count</i><b>], size_t </b><i>count</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>write</b>() writes up to <i>count</i> bytes from the buffer starting at <i>buf</i>
       to the file referred to by the file descriptor <i>fd</i>.

       The number of bytes written may be less than <i>count</i> if, for
       example, there is insufficient space on the underlying physical
       medium, or the <b>RLIMIT_FSIZE </b>resource limit is encountered (see
       <a href="setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit(2)</a>), or the call was interrupted by a signal handler
       after having written less than <i>count</i> bytes.  (See also <a href="../man7/pipe.7.html">pipe(7)</a>.)

       For a seekable file (i.e., one to which <a href="lseek.2.html">lseek(2)</a> may be applied,
       for example, a regular file) writing takes place at the file
       offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes
       actually written.  If the file was <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>ed with <b>O_APPEND</b>, the
       file offset is first set to the end of the file before writing.
       The adjustment of the file offset and the write operation are
       performed as an atomic step.

       POSIX requires that a <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> that can be proved to occur after a
       <b>write</b>() has returned will return the new data.  Note that not all
       filesystems are POSIX conforming.

       According to POSIX.1, if <i>count</i> is greater than <b>SSIZE_MAX</b>, the
       result is implementation-defined; see NOTES for the upper limit
       on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, the number of bytes written is returned.  On error,
       -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.

       Note that a successful <b>write</b>() may transfer fewer than <i>count</i>
       bytes.  Such partial writes can occur for various reasons; for
       example, because there was insufficient space on the disk device
       to write all of the requested bytes, or because a blocked <b>write</b>()
       to a socket, pipe, or similar was interrupted by a signal handler
       after it had transferred some, but before it had transferred all
       of the requested bytes.  In the event of a partial write, the
       caller can make another <b>write</b>() call to transfer the remaining
       bytes.  The subsequent call will either transfer further bytes or
       may result in an error (e.g., if the disk is now full).

       If <i>count</i> is zero and <i>fd</i> refers to a regular file, then <b>write</b>()
       may return a failure status if one of the errors below is
       detected.  If no errors are detected, or error detection is not
       performed, 0 is returned without causing any other effect.  If
       <i>count</i> is zero and <i>fd</i> refers to a file other than a regular file,
       the results are not specified.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EAGAIN </b>The file descriptor <i>fd</i> refers to a file other than a
              socket and has been marked nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), and
              the write would block.  See <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a> for further details on
              the <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>flag.

       <b>EAGAIN </b>or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The file descriptor <i>fd</i> refers to a socket and has been
              marked nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), and the write would
              block.  POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned
              for this case, and does not require these constants to
              have the same value, so a portable application should
              check for both possibilities.

       <b>EBADF  </b><i>fd</i> is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for
              writing.

       <b>EDESTADDRREQ</b>
              <i>fd</i> refers to a datagram socket for which a peer address
              has not been set using <a href="connect.2.html">connect(2)</a>.

       <b>EDQUOT </b>The user's quota of disk blocks on the filesystem
              containing the file referred to by <i>fd</i> has been exhausted.

       <b>EFAULT </b><i>buf</i> is outside your accessible address space.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the
              implementation-defined maximum file size or the process's
              file size limit, or to write at a position past the
              maximum allowed offset.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was
              written; see <a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal(7)</a>.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>fd</i> is attached to an object which is unsuitable for
              writing; or the file was opened with the <b>O_DIRECT </b>flag,
              and either the address specified in <i>buf</i>, the value
              specified in <i>count</i>, or the file offset is not suitably
              aligned.

       <b>EIO    </b>A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.
              This error may relate to the write-back of data written by
              an earlier <b>write</b>(), which may have been issued to a
              different file descriptor on the same file.  Since Linux
              4.13, errors from write-back come with a promise that they
              <i>may</i> be reported by subsequent.  <b>write</b>() requests, and <i>will</i>
              be reported by a subsequent <a href="fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a> (whether or not they
              were also reported by <b>write</b>()).  An alternate cause of <b>EIO</b>
              on networked filesystems is when an advisory lock had been
              taken out on the file descriptor and this lock has been
              lost.  See the <i>Lost locks</i> section of <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> for further
              details.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The device containing the file referred to by <i>fd</i> has no
              room for the data.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The operation was prevented by a file seal; see <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

       <b>EPIPE  </b><i>fd</i> is connected to a pipe or socket whose reading end is
              closed.  When this happens the writing process will also
              receive a <b>SIGPIPE </b>signal.  (Thus, the write return value
              is seen only if the program catches, blocks or ignores
              this signal.)

       Other errors may occur, depending on the object connected to <i>fd</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

       Under SVr4 a write may be interrupted and return <b>EINTR </b>at any
       point, not just before any data is written.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       A successful return from <b>write</b>() does not make any guarantee that
       data has been committed to disk.  On some filesystems, including
       NFS, it does not even guarantee that space has successfully been
       reserved for the data.  In this case, some errors might be
       delayed until a future <b>write</b>(), <a href="fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a>, or even <a href="close.2.html">close(2)</a>.  The
       only way to be sure is to call <a href="fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a> after you are done
       writing all your data.

       If a <b>write</b>() is interrupted by a signal handler before any bytes
       are written, then the call fails with the error <b>EINTR</b>; if it is
       interrupted after at least one byte has been written, the call
       succeeds, and returns the number of bytes written.

       On Linux, <b>write</b>() (and similar system calls) will transfer at
       most 0x7ffff000 (2,147,479,552) bytes, returning the number of
       bytes actually transferred.  (This is true on both 32-bit and
       64-bit systems.)

       An error return value while performing <b>write</b>() using direct I/O
       does not mean the entire write has failed.  Partial data may be
       written and the data at the file offset on which the <b>write</b>() was
       attempted should be considered inconsistent.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       According to POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4 Section XSI 2.9.7 ("Thread
       Interactions with Regular File Operations"):

           All of the following functions shall be atomic with respect
           to each other in the effects specified in POSIX.1-2008 when
           they operate on regular files or symbolic links: ...

       Among the APIs subsequently listed are <b>write</b>() and <a href="writev.2.html">writev(2)</a>.
       And among the effects that should be atomic across threads (and
       processes) are updates of the file offset.  However, before Linux
       3.14, this was not the case: if two processes that share an open
       file description (see <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>) perform a <b>write</b>() (or <a href="writev.2.html">writev(2)</a>)
       at the same time, then the I/O operations were not atomic with
       respect to updating the file offset, with the result that the
       blocks of data output by the two processes might (incorrectly)
       overlap.  This problem was fixed in Linux 3.14.
