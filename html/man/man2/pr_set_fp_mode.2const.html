DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       On the MIPS architecture, user-space code can be built using an
       ABI which permits linking with code that has more restrictive
       floating-point (FP) requirements.  For example, user-space code
       may be built to target the O32 FPXX ABI and linked with code
       built for either one of the more restrictive FP32 or FP64 ABIs.
       When more restrictive code is linked in, the overall requirement
       for the process is to use the more restrictive floating-point
       mode.

       Because the kernel has no means of knowing in advance which mode
       the process should be executed in, and because these restrictions
       can change over the lifetime of the process, the <b>PR_SET_FP_MODE</b>
       operation is provided to allow control of the floating-point mode
       from user space.

       The <i>mode</i> argument is a bit mask describing the floating-point
       mode used:

       <b>PR_FP_MODE_FR</b>
              When this bit is <i>unset</i> (so called <b>FR=0 </b>or <b>FR0 </b>mode), the
              32 floating-point registers are 32 bits wide, and 64-bit
              registers are represented as a pair of registers (even-
              and odd- numbered, with the even-numbered register
              containing the lower 32 bits, and the odd-numbered
              register containing the higher 32 bits).

              When this bit is <i>set</i> (on supported hardware), the 32
              floating-point registers are 64 bits wide (so called <b>FR=1</b>
              or <b>FR1 </b>mode).  Note that modern MIPS implementations (MIPS
              R6 and newer) support <b>FR=1 </b>mode only.

              Applications that use the O32 FP32 ABI can operate only
              when this bit is <i>unset</i> (<b>FR=0</b>; or they can be used with FRE
              enabled, see below).  Applications that use the O32 FP64
              ABI (and the O32 FP64A ABI, which exists to provide the
              ability to operate with existing FP32 code; see below) can
              operate only when this bit is <i>set</i> (<b>FR=1</b>).  Applications
              that use the O32 FPXX ABI can operate with either <b>FR=0 </b>or
              <b>FR=1</b>.

       <b>PR_FP_MODE_FRE</b>
              Enable emulation of 32-bit floating-point mode.  When this
              mode is enabled, it emulates 32-bit floating-point
              operations by raising a reserved-instruction exception on
              every instruction that uses 32-bit formats and the kernel
              then handles the instruction in software.  (The problem
              lies in the discrepancy of handling odd-numbered registers
              which are the high 32 bits of 64-bit registers with even
              numbers in <b>FR=0 </b>mode and the lower 32-bit parts of odd-
              numbered 64-bit registers in <b>FR=1 </b>mode.)  Enabling this
              bit is necessary when code with the O32 FP32 ABI should
              operate with code with compatible the O32 FPXX or O32
              FP64A ABIs (which require <b>FR=1 </b>FPU mode) or when it is
              executed on newer hardware (MIPS R6 onwards) which lacks
              <b>FR=0 </b>mode support when a binary with the FP32 ABI is used.

              Note that this mode makes sense only when the FPU is in
              64-bit mode (<b>FR=1</b>).

              Note that the use of emulation inherently has a
              significant performance hit and should be avoided if
              possible.

       In the N32/N64 ABI, 64-bit floating-point mode is always used, so
       FPU emulation is not required and the FPU always operates in <b>FR=1</b>
       mode.

       This operation is mainly intended for use by the dynamic linker
       (<a href="../man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so(8)</a>).
