SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;xfs/xfs_fs.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int ioctl(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, XFS_IOC_INUMBERS, struct xfs_inumbers_req</b>

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Query inode allocation information for groups of XFS inodes.
       This ioctl uses <b>struct xfs_inumbers_req </b>to set up a bulk transfer
       from the kernel:

           struct xfs_inumbers_req {
                struct xfs_bulk_ireq    hdr;
                struct xfs_inumbers     inumbers[];
           };

       See below for the <b>xfs_inumbers </b>structure definition.

           struct xfs_bulk_ireq {
                uint64_t                ino;
                uint32_t                flags;
                uint32_t                icount;
                uint32_t                ocount;
                uint32_t                agno;
                uint64_t                reserved[5];
           };

       <i>hdr</i> describes the information to query.  The layout and behavior
       are documented in the <a href="ioctl_xfs_bulkstat.2.html">ioctl_xfs_bulkstat(2)</a> manpage and will not
       be discussed further here.

       <i>inumbers</i> is an array of <b>struct xfs_inumbers </b>which is described
       below.  The array must have at least <i>icount</i> elements.

           struct xfs_inumbers {
                uint64_t                xi_startino;
                uint64_t                xi_allocmask;
                uint8_t                 xi_alloccount;
                uint8_t                 xi_version;
                uint8_t                 xi_padding[6];
           };

       This structure describes inode usage information for a group of
       64 consecutive inode numbers.

       <i>xi_startino</i> is the first inode number of this group.

       <i>xi_allocmask</i> is a bitmask telling which inodes in this group are
       allocated.  To clarify, bit <b>N </b>is set if inode <b>xi_startino</b>+<b>N </b>is
       allocated.

       <i>xi_alloccount</i> is the number of inodes in this group that are
       allocated.  This should be equal to popcnt(xi_allocmask).

       <i>xi_version</i> is the version of this data structure.  This will be
       set to <i>XFS_INUMBERS_VERSION_V5</i> by the kernel.

       <i>xi_padding[6]</i> is zeroed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       <b>EFAULT </b>The kernel was not able to copy into the userspace buffer.

       <b>EFSBADCRC</b>
              Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the
              query.

       <b>EFSCORRUPTED</b>
              Metadata corruption was encountered while performing the
              query.

       <b>EINVAL </b>One of the arguments was not valid.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error was encountered while performing the query.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>There was insufficient memory to perform the query.
