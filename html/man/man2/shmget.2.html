NAME </h2>
<pre>
       shmget - allocates a System V shared memory segment
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int shmget(key_t </b><i>key</i><b>, size_t </b><i>size</i><b>, int </b><i>shmflg</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>shmget</b>() returns the identifier of the System V shared memory
       segment associated with the value of the argument <i>key</i>.  It may be
       used either to obtain the identifier of a previously created
       shared memory segment (when <i>shmflg</i> is zero and <i>key</i> does not have
       the value <b>IPC_PRIVATE</b>), or to create a new set.

       A new shared memory segment, with size equal to the value of <i>size</i>
       rounded up to a multiple of <b>PAGE_SIZE</b>, is created if <i>key</i> has the
       value <b>IPC_PRIVATE </b>or <i>key</i> isn't <b>IPC_PRIVATE</b>, no shared memory
       segment corresponding to <i>key</i> exists, and <b>IPC_CREAT </b>is specified
       in <i>shmflg</i>.

       If <i>shmflg</i> specifies both <b>IPC_CREAT </b>and <b>IPC_EXCL </b>and a shared
       memory segment already exists for <i>key</i>, then <b>shmget</b>() fails with
       <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>EEXIST</b>.  (This is analogous to the effect of the
       combination <b>O_CREAT | O_EXCL </b>for <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>.)

       The value <i>shmflg</i> is composed of:

       <b>IPC_CREAT</b>
              Create a new segment.  If this flag is not used, then
              <b>shmget</b>() will find the segment associated with <i>key</i> and
              check to see if the user has permission to access the
              segment.

       <b>IPC_EXCL</b>
              This flag is used with <b>IPC_CREAT </b>to ensure that this call
              creates the segment.  If the segment already exists, the
              call fails.

       <b>SHM_HUGETLB </b>(since Linux 2.6)
              Allocate the segment using "huge" pages.  See the Linux
              kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.rst</i> for further
              information.

       <b>SHM_HUGE_2MB</b>
       <b>SHM_HUGE_1GB </b>(since Linux 3.8)
              Used in conjunction with <b>SHM_HUGETLB </b>to select alternative
              hugetlb page sizes (respectively, 2 MB and 1 GB) on
              systems that support multiple hugetlb page sizes.

              More generally, the desired huge page size can be
              configured by encoding the base-2 logarithm of the desired
              page size in the six bits at the offset <b>SHM_HUGE_SHIFT</b>.
              Thus, the above two constants are defined as:

                  #define SHM_HUGE_2MB    (21 &lt;&lt; SHM_HUGE_SHIFT)
                  #define SHM_HUGE_1GB    (30 &lt;&lt; SHM_HUGE_SHIFT)

              For some additional details, see the discussion of the
              similarly named constants in <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>.

       <b>SHM_NORESERVE </b>(since Linux 2.6.15)
              This flag serves the same purpose as the <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>
              <b>MAP_NORESERVE </b>flag.  Do not reserve swap space for this
              segment.  When swap space is reserved, one has the
              guarantee that it is possible to modify the segment.  When
              swap space is not reserved one might get <b>SIGSEGV </b>upon a
              write if no physical memory is available.  See also the
              discussion of the file <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> in
              <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       In addition to the above flags, the least significant 9 bits of
       <i>shmflg</i> specify the permissions granted to the owner, group, and
       others.  These bits have the same format, and the same meaning,
       as the <i>mode</i> argument of <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>.  Presently, execute permissions
       are not used by the system.

       When a new shared memory segment is created, its contents are
       initialized to zero values, and its associated data structure,
       <i>shmid_ds</i> (see <a href="shmctl.2.html">shmctl(2)</a>), is initialized as follows:

       •  <i>shm_perm.cuid</i> and <i>shm_perm.uid</i> are set to the effective user
          ID of the calling process.

       •  <i>shm_perm.cgid</i> and <i>shm_perm.gid</i> are set to the effective group
          ID of the calling process.

       •  The least significant 9 bits of <i>shm_perm.mode</i> are set to the
          least significant 9 bit of <i>shmflg</i>.

       •  <i>shm_segsz</i> is set to the value of <i>size</i>.

       •  <i>shm_lpid</i>, <i>shm_nattch</i>, <i>shm_atime</i>, and <i>shm_dtime</i> are set to 0.

       •  <i>shm_ctime</i> is set to the current time.

       If the shared memory segment already exists, the permissions are
       verified, and a check is made to see if it is marked for
       destruction.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, a valid shared memory identifier is returned.  On
       error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EACCES </b>The user does not have permission to access the shared
              memory segment, and does not have the <b>CAP_IPC_OWNER</b>
              capability in the user namespace that governs its IPC
              namespace.

       <b>EEXIST IPC_CREAT </b>and <b>IPC_EXCL </b>were specified in <i>shmflg</i>, but a
              shared memory segment already exists for <i>key</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>A new segment was to be created and <i>size</i> is less than
              <b>SHMMIN </b>or greater than <b>SHMMAX</b>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>A segment for the given <i>key</i> exists, but <i>size</i> is greater
              than the size of that segment.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
              has been reached.

       <b>ENOENT </b>No segment exists for the given <i>key</i>, and <b>IPC_CREAT </b>was not
              specified.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>No memory could be allocated for segment overhead.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>All possible shared memory IDs have been taken (<b>SHMMNI</b>),
              or allocating a segment of the requested <i>size</i> would cause
              the system to exceed the system-wide limit on shared
              memory (<b>SHMALL</b>).

       <b>EPERM  </b>The <b>SHM_HUGETLB </b>flag was specified, but the caller was not
              privileged (did not have the <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK </b>capability) and
              is not a member of the <i>sysctl_hugetlb_shm_group</i> group; see
              the description of <i>/proc/sys/vm/sysctl_hugetlb_shm_group</i>
              in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.

       <b>SHM_HUGETLB </b>and <b>SHM_NORESERVE </b>are Linux extensions.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>IPC_PRIVATE </b>isn't a flag field but a <i>key_t</i> type.  If this special
       value is used for <i>key</i>, the system call ignores all but the least
       significant 9 bits of <i>shmflg</i> and creates a new shared memory
       segment.

   <b>Shared memory limits</b>
       The following limits on shared memory segment resources affect
       the <b>shmget</b>() call:

       <b>SHMALL </b>System-wide limit on the total amount of shared memory,
              measured in units of the system page size.

              On Linux, this limit can be read and modified via
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/shmall</i>.  Since Linux 3.16, the default
              value for this limit is:

                  ULONG_MAX - 2^24

              The effect of this value (which is suitable for both
              32-bit and 64-bit systems) is to impose no limitation on
              allocations.  This value, rather than <b>ULONG_MAX</b>, was
              chosen as the default to prevent some cases where
              historical applications simply raised the existing limit
              without first checking its current value.  Such
              applications would cause the value to overflow if the
              limit was set at <b>ULONG_MAX</b>.

              From Linux 2.4 up to Linux 3.15, the default value for
              this limit was:

                  SHMMAX / PAGE_SIZE * (SHMMNI / 16)

              If <b>SHMMAX </b>and <b>SHMMNI </b>were not modified, then multiplying
              the result of this formula by the page size (to get a
              value in bytes) yielded a value of 8 GB as the limit on
              the total memory used by all shared memory segments.

       <b>SHMMAX </b>Maximum size in bytes for a shared memory segment.

              On Linux, this limit can be read and modified via
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax</i>.  Since Linux 3.16, the default
              value for this limit is:

                  ULONG_MAX - 2^24

              The effect of this value (which is suitable for both
              32-bit and 64-bit systems) is to impose no limitation on
              allocations.  See the description of <b>SHMALL </b>for a
              discussion of why this default value (rather than
              <b>ULONG_MAX</b>) is used.

              From Linux 2.2 up to Linux 3.15, the default value of this
              limit was 0x2000000 (32 MiB).

              Because it is not possible to map just part of a shared
              memory segment, the amount of virtual memory places
              another limit on the maximum size of a usable segment: for
              example, on i386 the largest segments that can be mapped
              have a size of around 2.8 GB, and on x86-64 the limit is
              around 127 TB.

       <b>SHMMIN </b>Minimum size in bytes for a shared memory segment:
              implementation dependent (currently 1 byte, though
              <b>PAGE_SIZE </b>is the effective minimum size).

       <b>SHMMNI </b>System-wide limit on the number of shared memory segments.
              In Linux 2.2, the default value for this limit was 128;
              since Linux 2.4, the default value is 4096.

              On Linux, this limit can be read and modified via
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmni</i>.

       The implementation has no specific limits for the per-process
       maximum number of shared memory segments (<b>SHMSEG</b>).

   <b>Linux notes</b>
       Until Linux 2.3.30, Linux would return <b>EIDRM </b>for a <b>shmget</b>() on a
       shared memory segment scheduled for deletion.
