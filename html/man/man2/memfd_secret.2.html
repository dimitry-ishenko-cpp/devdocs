NAME </h2>
<pre>
       memfd_secret - create an anonymous RAM-based file to access
       secret memory regions
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;      </b>/* Definition of <b>SYS_* </b>constants */
       <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int syscall(SYS_memfd_secret, unsigned int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>

       <i>Note</i>: glibc provides no wrapper for <b>memfd_secret</b>(), necessitating
       the use of <a href="syscall.2.html">syscall(2)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>memfd_secret</b>() creates an anonymous RAM-based file and returns a
       file descriptor that refers to it.  The file provides a way to
       create and access memory regions with stronger protection than
       usual RAM-based files and anonymous memory mappings.  Once all
       open references to the file are closed, it is automatically
       released.  The initial size of the file is set to 0.  Following
       the call, the file size should be set using <a href="ftruncate.2.html">ftruncate(2)</a>.

       The memory areas backing the file created with <a href="memfd_secret.2.html">memfd_secret(2)</a>
       are visible only to the processes that have access to the file
       descriptor.  The memory region is removed from the kernel page
       tables and only the page tables of the processes holding the file
       descriptor map the corresponding physical memory.  (Thus, the
       pages in the region can't be accessed by the kernel itself, so
       that, for example, pointers to the region can't be passed to
       system calls.)

       The following values may be bitwise ORed in <i>flags</i> to control the
       behavior of <b>memfd_secret</b>():

       <b>FD_CLOEXEC</b>
              Set the close-on-exec flag on the new file descriptor,
              which causes the region to be removed from the process on
              <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.  See the description of the <b>O_CLOEXEC </b>flag in
              <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>

       As its return value, <b>memfd_secret</b>() returns a new file descriptor
       that refers to an anonymous file.  This file descriptor is opened
       for both reading and writing (<b>O_RDWR</b>) and <b>O_LARGEFILE </b>is set for
       the file descriptor.

       With respect to <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, the usual semantics apply
       for the file descriptor created by <b>memfd_secret</b>().  A copy of the
       file descriptor is inherited by the child produced by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and
       refers to the same file.  The file descriptor is preserved across
       <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, unless the close-on-exec flag has been set.

       The memory region is locked into memory in the same way as with
       <a href="mlock.2.html">mlock(2)</a>, so that it will never be written into swap, and
       hibernation is inhibited for as long as any <b>memfd_secret</b>()
       descriptions exist.  However the implementation of <b>memfd_secret</b>()
       will not try to populate the whole range during the <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> call
       that attaches the region into the process's address space;
       instead, the pages are only actually allocated as they are
       faulted in.  The amount of memory allowed for memory mappings of
       the file descriptor obeys the same rules as <a href="mlock.2.html">mlock(2)</a> and cannot
       exceed <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>memfd_secret</b>() returns a new file descriptor.  On
       error, -1 is returned and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EINVAL </b><i>flags</i> included unknown bits.

       <b>EMFILE </b>The per-process limit on the number of open file
              descriptors has been reached.

       <b>EMFILE </b>The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
              has been reached.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>There was insufficient memory to create a new anonymous
              file.

       <b>ENOSYS memfd_secret</b>() is not implemented on this architecture, or
              has not been enabled on the kernel command-line with
              <b>secretmem_enable</b>=1.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 5.14.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>memfd_secret</b>() system call is designed to allow a user-space
       process to create a range of memory that is inaccessible to
       anybody else - kernel included.  There is no 100% guarantee that
       kernel won't be able to access memory ranges backed by
       <b>memfd_secret</b>() in any circumstances, but nevertheless, it is much
       harder to exfiltrate data from these regions.

       <b>memfd_secret</b>() provides the following protections:

       •  Enhanced protection (in conjunction with all the other in-
          kernel attack prevention systems) against ROP attacks.
          Absence of any in-kernel primitive for accessing memory backed
          by <b>memfd_secret</b>() means that one-gadget ROP attack can't work
          to perform data exfiltration.  The attacker would need to find
          enough ROP gadgets to reconstruct the missing page table
          entries, which significantly increases difficulty of the
          attack, especially when other protections like the kernel
          stack size limit and address space layout randomization are in
          place.

       •  Prevent cross-process user-space memory exposures.  Once a
          region for a <b>memfd_secret</b>() memory mapping is allocated, the
          user can't accidentally pass it into the kernel to be
          transmitted somewhere.  The memory pages in this region cannot
          be accessed via the direct map and they are disallowed in
          get_user_pages.

       •  Harden against exploited kernel flaws.  In order to access
          memory areas backed by <b>memfd_secret</b>(), a kernel-side attack
          would need to either walk the page tables and create new ones,
          or spawn a new privileged user-space process to perform
          secrets exfiltration using <a href="ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>.

       The way <b>memfd_secret</b>() allocates and locks the memory may impact
       overall system performance, therefore the system call is disabled
       by default and only available if the system administrator turned
       it on using "secretmem.enable=y" kernel parameter.

       To prevent potential data leaks of memory regions backed by
       <b>memfd_secret</b>() from a hybernation image, hybernation is prevented
       when there are active <b>memfd_secret</b>() users.
