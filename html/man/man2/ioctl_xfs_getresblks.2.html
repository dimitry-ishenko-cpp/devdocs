NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ioctl_xfs_getresblks - query and set XFS free space reservation
       information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;xfs/xfs_fs.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int ioctl(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, XFS_IOC_GET_RESBLKS, struct xfs_fsop_resblks</b>
       <b>*</b><i>arg</i><b>);</b>
       <b>int ioctl(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, XFS_IOC_SET_RESBLKS, struct xfs_fsop_resblks</b>
       <b>*</b><i>arg</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Query or set the free space reservation information.  These
       blocks are reserved by the filesystem as a final attempt to
       prevent metadata update failures due to insufficient space.  Only
       the system administrator can use these ioctls, because overriding
       the defaults is extremely dangerous.

       This functionality is intended only for use by XFS filesystem
       developers.

       The reservation information is conveyed in a structure of the
       following form:

           struct xfs_fsop_resblks {
                __u64  resblks;
                __u64  resblks_avail;
           };

       <i>resblks</i> is the number of blocks that the filesystem will try to
       maintain to prevent critical out of space situations.

       <i>resblks_avail</i> is the number of reserved blocks remaining.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       <b>EFSBADCRC</b>
              Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the
              query.

       <b>EFSCORRUPTED</b>
              Metadata corruption was encountered while performing the
              query.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The specified allocation group number is not valid for
              this filesystem.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error was encountered while performing the query.

       <b>EPERM  </b>Caller does not have permission to call this ioctl.
