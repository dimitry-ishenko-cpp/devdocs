<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;xfs/xfs_fs.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int ioctl(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, XFS_IOC_FSBULKSTAT, struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq</b>
       <b>*</b><i>arg</i><b>);</b>

       <b>xfs_fsop_bulkreq *</b><i>arg</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Query stat information for a group of XFS inodes.

       NOTE: This ioctl has been superseded.  Please see the
       <a href="ioctl_xfs_bulkstat.2.html">ioctl_xfs_bulkstat(2)</a> manpage for information about its
       replacement.

       These ioctls use <b>struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq </b>to set up a bulk
       transfer with the kernel:

           struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq {
                __u64             *lastip;
                __s32             count;
                void              *ubuffer;
                __s32             *ocount;
           };

       <i>lastip</i> points to a value that will receive the number of the
       "last inode."  This cannot be NULL.  For <b>FSBULKSTAT</b>, this should
       be set to one less than the number of the first inode for which
       the caller wants information, or zero to start with the first
       inode in the filesystem.  For <b>FSBULKSTAT_SINGLE</b>, this should be
       set to the number of the inode for which the caller wants
       information.  After the call, this value will be set to the
       number of the last inode for which information was supplied.
       This field will not be updated if <i>ocount</i> is NULL.

       <i>count</i> is the number of elements in the <b>ubuffer </b>array and
       therefore the number of inodes for which to return stat
       information.  This value must be set to 1 for <b>FSBULKSTAT_SINGLE</b>.

       <i>ocount</i> points to a value that will receive the number of records
       returned.  If this value is NULL, then neither <i>ocount</i> nor <i>lastip</i>
       will be updated.

       <i>ubuffer</i> points to a memory buffer into which inode stat
       information will be copied.  This buffer must be an array of
       <b>struct xfs_bstat </b>which is described below.  The array must have
       at least <i>count</i> elements.

           struct xfs_bstat {
                __u64             bs_ino;
                __u16             bs_mode;
                __u16             bs_nlink;
                __u32             bs_uid;
                __u32             bs_gid;
                __u32             bs_rdev;
                __s32             bs_blksize;
                __s64             bs_size;
                struct xfs_bstime bs_atime;
                struct xfs_bstime bs_mtime;
                struct xfs_bstime bs_ctime;
                int64_t           bs_blocks;
                __u32             bs_xflags;
                __s32             bs_extsize;
                __s32             bs_extents;
                __u32             bs_gen;
                __u16             bs_projid_lo;
                __u16             bs_forkoff;
                __u16             bs_projid_hi;
                uint16_t          bs_sick;
                uint16_t          bs_checked;
                unsigned char     bs_pad[2];
                __u32             bs_cowextsize;
                __u32             bs_dmevmask;
                __u16             bs_dmstate;
                __u16             bs_aextents;
           };

       The structure members are as follows:

       <i>bs_ino</i> is the inode number for this record.

       <i>bs_mode</i> is the file type and mode.

       <i>bs_nlink</i> is the number of hard links to this inode.

       <i>bs_uid</i> is the user id.

       <i>bs_gid</i> is the group id.

       <i>bs_rdev</i> is the encoded device id if this is a special file.

       <i>bs_blksize</i> is the size of a data block for this file, in units of
       bytes.

       <i>bs_size</i> is the size of the file, in bytes.

       <i>bs_atime</i> is the last time this file was accessed.

       <i>bs_mtime</i> is the last time the contents of this file were
       modified.

       <i>bs_ctime</i> is the last time this inode record was modified.

       <i>bs_blocks</i> is the number of filesystem blocks allocated to this
       file, including metadata.

       <i>bs_xflags</i> contains the extended flags that are set on this inode.
       These flags are the same values as those defined in the <b>XFS INODE</b>
       <b>FLAGS </b>section of the <a href="ioctl_xfs_fsgetxattr.2.html">ioctl_xfs_fsgetxattr(2)</a> manpage.

       <i>bs_extsize</i> is the extent size hint for this file, in bytes.

       <i>bs_extents</i> is the number of storage mappings associated with this
       file's data.

       <i>bs_gen</i> is the generation number of the inode record.

       <i>bs_projid_lo</i> is the lower 16-bits of the project id.

       <i>bs_forkoff</i> is the offset of the attribute fork in the inode
       record, in bytes.

       <i>bs_projid_hi</i> is the upper 16-bits of the project id.

       <i>bs_pad[6]</i> is zeroed.

       <i>bs_cowextsize</i> is the Copy on Write extent size hint for this
       file, in bytes.

       <i>bs_dmevmask</i> is unused on Linux.

       <i>bs_dmstate</i> is unused on Linux.

       <i>bs_aextents</i> is the number of storage mappings associated with
       this file's extended attributes.

       The fields <i>bs_sick</i> and <i>bs_checked</i> indicate the relative health of
       various inode metadata:

       • If a given sick flag is set in <i>bs_sick</i>, then that piece of
         metadata has been observed to be damaged.  The same bit should
         be set in <i>bs_checked</i>.

       • If a given sick flag is set in <i>bs_checked</i> but is not set in
         <i>bs_sick</i>, then that piece of metadata has been checked and is
         not faulty.

       • If a given sick flag is not set in <i>bs_checked</i>, then no
         conclusion can be made.

       The following flags apply to these fields:

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_INODE</b>
                  The inode's record itself.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_BMBTD</b>

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_BMBTC</b>
                  Copy on Write staging extent mappings.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_DIR</b>
                  Directory information.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_XATTR</b>
                  Extended attribute data.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_SYMLINK</b>
                  Symbolic link target.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_PARENT</b>
                  Parent pointers.
