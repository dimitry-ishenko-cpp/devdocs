</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This XFS ioctl asks the kernel driver to examine a piece of
       filesystem metadata for errors or suboptimal metadata.
       Examination includes running metadata verifiers, checking records
       for obviously incorrect or impossible values, and cross-
       referencing each record with any other available metadata in the
       filesystem.  This ioctl can also try to repair or optimize
       metadata, though this may block normal filesystem operations for
       a long period of time.  The type and location of the metadata to
       scrub is conveyed in a structure of the following form:

           struct xfs_scrub_metadata {
                __u32 sm_type;
                __u32 sm_flags;
                __u64 sm_ino;
                __u32 sm_gen;
                __u32 sm_agno;
                __u64 sm_reserved[5];
           };

       The field <i>sm_reserved</i> must be zero.

       The field <i>sm_type</i> indicates the type of metadata to check:

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_PROBE</b>
                  Probe the kernel to see if it is willing to try to
                  check or repair this filesystem.  <b>sm_agno</b>, <b>sm_ino</b>, and
                  <b>sm_gen </b>must be zero.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_SB</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_AGF</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_AGFL</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_AGI</b>
                  Examine a given allocation group's superblock, free
                  space header, free block list, or inode header,
                  respectively.  Headers are checked for obviously
                  incorrect values and cross-referenced against the
                  allocation group's metadata btrees, if possible.  The
                  allocation group number must be given in <b>sm_agno</b>.
                  <b>sm_ino </b>and <b>sm_gen </b>must be zero.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_BNOBT</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_CNTBT</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_INOBT</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_FINOBT</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_RMAPBT</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_REFCNTBT</b>
                  Examine a given allocation group's two free space
                  btrees, two inode btrees, reverse mapping btrees, or
                  reference count btrees, respectively.  Records are
                  checked for obviously incorrect values and cross-
                  referenced with other allocation group metadata
                  records to ensure that there are no conflicts.  The
                  allocation group number must be given in <b>sm_agno</b>.
                  <b>sm_ino </b>and <b>sm_gen </b>must be zero.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_INODE</b>
                  Examine a given inode record for obviously incorrect
                  values and discrepancies with the rest of filesystem
                  metadata.  Parent pointers are checked for impossible
                  inode values and are then followed up to the parent
                  directory to ensure that the linkage is correct.  The
                  inode to examine may be specified either through
                  <b>sm_ino </b>and <b>sm_gen</b>; if not specified, then the file
                  described by <b>dest_fd </b>will be examined.  <b>sm_agno </b>must
                  be zero.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_BMBTD</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_BMBTA</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_BMBTC</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_PARENT</b>
                  Examine a given inode's data block map, extended
                  attribute block map, copy on write block map, or
                  parent inode pointer.  Inode records are examined for
                  obviously incorrect values and discrepancies with the
                  three block map types.  The block maps are checked for
                  obviously wrong values and cross-referenced with the
                  allocation group space extent metadata for
                  discrepancies.  The inode to examine can be specified
                  in the same manner as <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_INODE</b>.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_XATTR</b>
                  Examine the extended attribute records and indices of
                  a given inode for incorrect pointers and other signs
                  of damage.  The inode to examine can be specified in
                  the same manner as <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_INODE</b>.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_DIR</b>
                  Examine the entries in a given directory for invalid
                  data or dangling pointers.  The directory to examine
                  can be specified in the same manner as
                  <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_INODE</b>.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_SYMLINK</b>
                  Examine the target of a symbolic link for obvious
                  pathname problems.  The link to examine can be
                  specified in the same manner as <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_INODE</b>.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_RTBITMAP</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_RTSUM</b>
                  Examine the realtime block bitmap and realtime summary
                  inodes for corruption.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_UQUOTA</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_GQUOTA</b>
           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_PQUOTA</b>
                  Examine all user, group, or project quota records for
                  corruption.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_FSCOUNTERS</b>
                  Examine all filesystem summary counters (free blocks,
                  inode count, free inode count) for errors.

       The field <i>sm_flags</i> control the behavior of the scrub operation
       and provide more information about the outcome of the operation.
       If none of the <b>XFS_SCRUB_OFLAG_* </b>flags are set upon return, the
       metadata is clean.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_IFLAG_REPAIR</b>
                  If the caller sets this flag, the kernel driver will
                  examine the metadata and try to fix all problems and
                  to optimize metadata when possible.  If no errors
                  occur during the repair operation, the check is
                  performed a second time to determine whether the
                  repair succeeded.  If errors occur, the call returns
                  an error status immediately.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_OFLAG_CORRUPT</b>
                  The metadata was corrupt when the call returned.  If
                  <b>XFS_SCRUB_IFLAG_REPAIR </b>was specified, then an
                  attempted repair failed to fix the problem.  Unmount
                  the filesystem and run <b>xfs_repair </b>to fix the
                  filesystem.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_OFLAG_PREEN</b>
                  The metadata is ok, but some aspect of the metadata
                  could be optimized to increase performance.  Call
                  again with <b>XFS_SCRUB_IFLAG_REPAIR </b>to optimize the
                  metadata.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_OFLAG_XFAIL</b>
                  Filesystem errors were encountered when accessing
                  other metadata to cross-reference the records attached
                  to this metadata object.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_OFLAG_XCORRUPT</b>
                  Discrepancies were found when cross-referencing the
                  records attached to this metadata object against all
                  other available metadata in the system.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_OFLAG_INCOMPLETE</b>
                  The checker was unable to complete its check of all
                  records.

           <b>XFS_SCRUB_OFLAG_WARNING</b>
                  The checker encountered a metadata object with
                  potentially problematic records.  However, the records
                  were not obviously corrupt.

       For metadata checkers that operate on inodes or inode metadata,
       the fields <i>sm_ino</i> and <i>sm_gen</i> are the inode number and generation
       number of the inode to check.  If the inode number is zero, the
       inode represented by <i>dest_fd</i> is used instead.  If the generation
       number of the inode does not match <i>sm_gen</i>, the call will return
       an error code for the invalid argument.  The <i>sm_agno</i> field must
       be zero.

       For metadata checkers that operate on allocation group metadata,
       the field <i>sm_agno</i> indicates the allocation group in which to find
       the metadata.  The <i>sm_ino</i> and <i>sm_gen</i> fields must be zero.

       For metadata checkers that operate on filesystem-wide metadata,
       no further arguments are required.  <i>sm_agno</i>, <i>sm_ino</i>, and <i>sm_gen</i>
       must all be zero.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       <b>EBUSY  </b>The filesystem object is busy; the operation will have to
              be tried again.

       <b>EFSCORRUPTED</b>
              Severe filesystem corruption was detected and could not be
              repaired.  Unmount the filesystem and run <b>xfs_repair </b>to
              fix the filesystem.

       <b>EINVAL </b>One or more of the arguments specified is invalid.

       <b>ENOENT </b>The specified metadata object does not exist.  For
              example, this error code is returned for a
              <b>XFS_SCRUB_TYPE_REFCNTBT </b>request on a filesystem that does
              not support reflink.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>There was not sufficient memory to perform the scrub or
              repair operation.  Some operations (most notably reference
              count checking) require large amounts of memory.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>There is not enough free disk space to attempt a repair.

       <b>ENOTRECOVERABLE</b>
              Filesystem was mounted in <b>norecovery </b>mode and therefore
              has an unclean log.  Neither scrub nor repair operations
              can be attempted with an unclean log.

       <b>ENOTTY </b>Online scrubbing or repair were not enabled.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              Repairs of the requested metadata object are not
              supported.

       <b>EROFS  </b>Filesystem is read-only and a repair was requested.

       <b>ESHUTDOWN</b>
              Filesystem is shut down due to previous errors.
