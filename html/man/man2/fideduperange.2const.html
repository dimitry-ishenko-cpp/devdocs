SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;linux/fs.h&gt;      </b>/* Definition of <b>FIDEDUPERANGE </b>and
                                     <b>FILE_DEDUPE_* </b>constants<b>*/</b>

       <b>int ioctl(int </b><i>src_fd</i><b>, FIDEDUPERANGE, struct file_dedupe_range *</b><i>arg</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If a filesystem supports files sharing physical storage between
       multiple files, this <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> operation can be used to make some
       of the data in the <b>src_fd </b>file appear in the <b>dest_fd </b>file by
       sharing the underlying storage if the file data is identical
       ("deduplication").  Both files must reside within the same
       filesystem.  This reduces storage consumption by allowing the
       filesystem to store one shared copy of the data.  If a file write
       should occur to a shared region, the filesystem must ensure that
       the changes remain private to the file being written.  This
       behavior is commonly referred to as "copy on write".

       This ioctl performs the "compare and share if identical"
       operation on up to <i>src_length</i> bytes from file descriptor <i>src_fd</i>
       at offset <i>src_offset</i>.  This information is conveyed in a
       structure of the following form:

           struct file_dedupe_range {
               __u64 src_offset;
               __u64 src_length;
               __u16 dest_count;
               __u16 reserved1;
               __u32 reserved2;
               struct file_dedupe_range_info info[0];
           };

       Deduplication is atomic with regards to concurrent writes, so no
       locks need to be taken to obtain a consistent deduplicated copy.

       The fields <i>reserved1</i> and <i>reserved2</i> must be zero.

       Destinations for the deduplication operation are conveyed in the
       array at the end of the structure.  The number of destinations is
       given in <i>dest_count</i>, and the destination information is conveyed
       in the following form:

           struct file_dedupe_range_info {
               __s64 dest_fd;
               __u64 dest_offset;
               __u64 bytes_deduped;
               __s32 status;
               __u32 reserved;
           };

       Each deduplication operation targets <i>src_length</i> bytes in file
       descriptor <i>dest_fd</i> at offset <i>dest_offset</i>.  The field <i>reserved</i>
       must be zero.  During the call, <i>src_fd</i> must be open for reading
       and <i>dest_fd</i> must be open for writing.  The combined size of the
       struct <i>file_dedupe_range</i> and the struct <i>file_dedupe_range_info</i>
       array must not exceed the system page size.  The maximum size of
       <i>src_length</i> is filesystem dependent and is typically 16 MiB.  This
       limit will be enforced silently by the filesystem.  By
       convention, the storage used by <i>src_fd</i> is mapped into <i>dest_fd</i> and
       the previous contents in <i>dest_fd</i> are freed.

       Upon successful completion of this ioctl, the number of bytes
       successfully deduplicated is returned in <i>bytes_deduped</i> and a
       status code for the deduplication operation is returned in
       <i>status</i>.  If even a single byte in the range does not match, the
       deduplication operation request will be ignored and <i>status</i> set to
       <b>FILE_DEDUPE_RANGE_DIFFERS</b>.  The <i>status</i> code is set to
       <b>FILE_DEDUPE_RANGE_SAME </b>for success, a negative error code in case
       of error, or <b>FILE_DEDUPE_RANGE_DIFFERS </b>if the data did not match.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Possible errors include (but are not limited to) the following:

       <b>EBADF  </b><i>src_fd</i> is not open for reading; <i>dest_fd</i> is not open for
              writing or is open for append-only writes; or the
              filesystem which <i>src_fd</i> resides on does not support
              deduplication.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The filesystem does not support deduplicating the ranges
              of the given files.  This error can also appear if either
              file descriptor represents a device, FIFO, or socket.
              Disk filesystems generally require the offset and length
              arguments to be aligned to the fundamental block size.
              Neither Btrfs nor XFS support overlapping deduplication
              ranges in the same file.

       <b>EISDIR </b>One of the files is a directory and the filesystem does
              not support shared regions in directories.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The kernel was unable to allocate sufficient memory to
              perform the operation or <i>dest_count</i> is so large that the
              input argument description spans more than a single page
              of memory.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              This can appear if the filesystem does not support
              deduplicating either file descriptor, or if either file
              descriptor refers to special inodes.

       <b>EPERM  </b><i>dest_fd</i> is immutable.

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              One of the files is a swap file.  Swap files cannot share
              storage.

       <b>EXDEV  </b><i>dest_fd</i> and <i>src_fd</i> are not on the same mounted filesystem.
</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Some filesystems may limit the amount of data that can be
       deduplicated in a single call.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 4.5.

       It was previously known as <b>BTRFS_IOC_FILE_EXTENT_SAME </b>and was
       private to Btrfs.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Because a copy-on-write operation requires the allocation of new
       storage, the <a href="fallocate.2.html">fallocate(2)</a> operation may unshare shared blocks to
       guarantee that subsequent writes will not fail because of lack of
       disk space.
