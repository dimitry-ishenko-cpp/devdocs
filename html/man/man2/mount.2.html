       <b>#include &lt;sys/mount.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int mount(const char *</b><i>source</i><b>, const char *</b><i>target</i><b>,</b>
                 <b>const char *</b><i>filesystemtype</i><b>, unsigned long </b><i>mountflags</i><b>,</b>
                 <b>const void *_Nullable </b><i>data</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mount</b>() attaches the filesystem specified by <i>source</i> (which is
       often a pathname referring to a device, but can also be the
       pathname of a directory or file, or a dummy string) to the
       location (a directory or file) specified by the pathname in
       <i>target</i>.

       Appropriate privilege (Linux: the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability) is
       required to mount filesystems.

       Values for the <i>filesystemtype</i> argument supported by the kernel
       are listed in <i>/proc/filesystems</i> (e.g., "btrfs", "ext4", "jfs",
       "xfs", "vfat", "fuse", "tmpfs", "cgroup", "proc", "mqueue",
       "nfs", "cifs", "iso9660").  Further types may become available
       when the appropriate modules are loaded.

       The <i>data</i> argument is interpreted by the different filesystems.
       Typically it is a string of comma-separated options understood by
       this filesystem.  See <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> for details of the options
       available for each filesystem type.  This argument may be
       specified as NULL, if there are no options.

       A call to <b>mount</b>() performs one of a number of general types of
       operation, depending on the bits specified in <i>mountflags</i>.  The
       choice of which operation to perform is determined by testing the
       bits set in <i>mountflags</i>, with the tests being conducted in the
       order listed here:

       •  Remount an existing mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes <b>MS_REMOUNT</b>.

       •  Create a bind mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes <b>MS_BIND</b>.

       •  Change the propagation type of an existing mount: <i>mountflags</i>
          includes one of <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or
          <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>.

       •  Move an existing mount to a new location: <i>mountflags</i> includes
          <b>MS_MOVE</b>.

       •  Create a new mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes none of the above
          flags.

       Each of these operations is detailed later in this page.  Further
       flags may be specified in <i>mountflags</i> to modify the behavior of
       <b>mount</b>(), as described below.

   <b>Additional mount flags</b>
       The list below describes the additional flags that can be
       specified in <i>mountflags</i>.  Note that some operation types ignore
       some or all of these flags, as described later in this page.

       <b>MS_DIRSYNC </b>(since Linux 2.5.19)
              Make directory changes on this filesystem synchronous.
              (This property can be obtained for individual directories
              or subtrees using <a href="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr(1)</a>.)

       <b>MS_LAZYTIME </b>(since Linux 4.0)
              Reduce on-disk updates of inode timestamps (atime, mtime,
              ctime) by maintaining these changes only in memory.  The
              on-disk timestamps are updated only when:

              •  the inode needs to be updated for some change unrelated
                 to file timestamps;

              •  the application employs <a href="fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a>, <a href="syncfs.2.html">syncfs(2)</a>, or
                 <a href="sync.2.html">sync(2)</a>;

              •  an undeleted inode is evicted from memory; or

              •  more than 24 hours have passed since the inode was
                 written to disk.

              This mount option significantly reduces writes needed to
              update the inode's timestamps, especially mtime and atime.
              However, in the event of a system crash, the atime and
              mtime fields on disk might be out of date by up to 24
              hours.

              Examples of workloads where this option could be of
              significant benefit include frequent random writes to
              preallocated files, as well as cases where the
              <b>MS_STRICTATIME </b>mount option is also enabled.  (The
              advantage of combining <b>MS_STRICTATIME </b>and <b>MS_LAZYTIME </b>is
              that <a href="stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> will return the correctly updated atime, but
              the atime updates will be flushed to disk only in the
              cases listed above.)

       <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>
              Permit mandatory locking on files in this filesystem.
              (Mandatory locking must still be enabled on a per-file
              basis, as described in <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.)  Since Linux 4.5, this
              mount option requires the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability and a
              kernel configured with the <b>CONFIG_MANDATORY_FILE_LOCKING</b>
              option.  Mandatory locking has been fully deprecated in
              Linux 5.15, so this flag should be considered deprecated.

       <b>MS_NOATIME</b>
              Do not update access times for (all types of) files on
              this filesystem.

       <b>MS_NODEV</b>
              Do not allow access to devices (special files) on this
              filesystem.

       <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>
              Do not update access times for directories on this
              filesystem.  This flag provides a subset of the
              functionality provided by <b>MS_NOATIME</b>; that is, <b>MS_NOATIME</b>
              implies <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>.

       <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>
              Do not allow programs to be executed from this filesystem.

       <b>MS_NOSUID</b>
              Do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file
              capabilities when executing programs from this filesystem.
              In addition, SELinux domain transitions require the
              permission <i>nosuid_transition</i>, which in turn needs also the
              policy capability <i>nnp_nosuid_transition</i>.

       <b>MS_RDONLY</b>
              Mount filesystem read-only.

       <b>MS_REC </b>(since Linux 2.4.11)
              Used in conjunction with <b>MS_BIND </b>to create a recursive
              bind mount, and in conjunction with the propagation type
              flags to recursively change the propagation type of all of
              the mounts in a subtree.  See below for further details.

       <b>MS_RELATIME </b>(since Linux 2.6.20)
              When a file on this filesystem is accessed, update the
              file's last access time (atime) only if the current value
              of atime is less than or equal to the file's last
              modification time (mtime) or last status change time
              (ctime).  This option is useful for programs, such as
              <b>mutt</b>(1), that need to know when a file has been read since
              it was last modified.  Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel
              defaults to the behavior provided by this flag (unless
              <b>MS_NOATIME </b>was specified), and the <b>MS_STRICTATIME </b>flag is
              required to obtain traditional semantics.  In addition,
              since Linux 2.6.30, the file's last access time is always
              updated if it is more than 1 day old.

       <b>MS_SILENT </b>(since Linux 2.6.17)
              Suppress the display of certain (<i>printk</i>()) warning
              messages in the kernel log.  This flag supersedes the
              misnamed and obsolete <b>MS_VERBOSE </b>flag (available since
              Linux 2.4.12), which has the same meaning.

       <b>MS_STRICTATIME </b>(since Linux 2.6.30)
              Always update the last access time (atime) when files on
              this filesystem are accessed.  (This was the default
              behavior before Linux 2.6.30.)  Specifying this flag
              overrides the effect of setting the <b>MS_NOATIME </b>and
              <b>MS_RELATIME </b>flags.

       <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>
              Make writes on this filesystem synchronous (as though the
              <b>O_SYNC </b>flag to <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a> was specified for all file opens to
              this filesystem).

       <b>MS_NOSYMFOLLOW </b>(since Linux 5.10)
              Do not follow symbolic links when resolving paths.
              Symbolic links can still be created, and <a href="../man1/readlink.1.html">readlink(1)</a>,
              <a href="readlink.2.html">readlink(2)</a>, <a href="../man1/realpath.1.html">realpath(1)</a>, and <a href="../man3/realpath.3.html">realpath(3)</a> all still work
              properly.

       From Linux 2.4 onward, some of the above flags are settable on a
       per-mount basis, while others apply to the superblock of the
       mounted filesystem, meaning that all mounts of the same
       filesystem share those flags.  (Previously, all of the flags were
       per-superblock.)

       The per-mount-point flags are as follows:

       •  Since Linux 2.4: <b>MS_NODEV</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, and <b>MS_NOSUID </b>flags are
          settable on a per-mount-point basis.

       •  Additionally, since Linux 2.6.16: <b>MS_NOATIME </b>and
          <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>.

       •  Additionally, since Linux 2.6.20: <b>MS_RELATIME</b>.

       The following flags are per-superblock: <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b>, <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b>,
       <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>, <b>MS_SILENT</b>, and <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>.  The initial settings
       of these flags are determined on the first mount of the
       filesystem, and will be shared by all subsequent mounts of the
       same filesystem.  Subsequently, the settings of the flags can be
       changed via a remount operation (see below).  Such changes will
       be visible via all mounts associated with the filesystem.

       Since Linux 2.6.16, <b>MS_RDONLY </b>can be set or cleared on a per-
       mount-point basis as well as on the underlying filesystem
       superblock.  The mounted filesystem will be writable only if
       neither the filesystem nor the mountpoint are flagged as read-
       only.

   <b>Remounting an existing mount</b>
       An existing mount may be remounted by specifying <b>MS_REMOUNT </b>in
       <i>mountflags</i>.  This allows you to change the <i>mountflags</i> and <i>data</i> of
       an existing mount without having to unmount and remount the
       filesystem.  <i>target</i> should be the same value specified in the
       initial <b>mount</b>() call.

       The <i>source</i> and <i>filesystemtype</i> arguments are ignored.

       The <i>mountflags</i> and <i>data</i> arguments should match the values used in
       the original <b>mount</b>() call, except for those parameters that are
       being deliberately changed.

       The following <i>mountflags</i> can be changed: <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b>,
       <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>, <b>MS_NOATIME</b>, <b>MS_NODEV</b>, <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>,
       <b>MS_NOSUID</b>, <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, <b>MS_RDONLY</b>, <b>MS_STRICTATIME </b>(whose effect
       is to clear the <b>MS_NOATIME </b>and <b>MS_RELATIME </b>flags), and
       <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>.  Attempts to change the setting of the <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b>
       and <b>MS_SILENT </b>flags during a remount are silently ignored.  Note
       that changes to per-superblock flags are visible via all mounts
       of the associated filesystem (because the per-superblock flags
       are shared by all mounts).

       Since Linux 3.17, if none of <b>MS_NOATIME</b>, <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>,
       <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, or <b>MS_STRICTATIME </b>is specified in <i>mountflags</i>, then
       the remount operation preserves the existing values of these
       flags (rather than defaulting to <b>MS_RELATIME</b>).

       Since Linux 2.6.26, the <b>MS_REMOUNT </b>flag can be used with <b>MS_BIND</b>
       to modify only the per-mount-point flags.  This is particularly
       useful for setting or clearing the "read-only" flag on a mount
       without changing the underlying filesystem.  Specifying
       <i>mountflags</i> as:

           MS_REMOUNT | MS_BIND | MS_RDONLY

       will make access through this mountpoint read-only, without
       affecting other mounts.

   <b>Creating a bind mount</b>
       If <i>mountflags</i> includes <b>MS_BIND </b>(available since Linux 2.4), then
       perform a bind mount.  A bind mount makes a file or a directory
       subtree visible at another point within the single directory
       hierarchy.  Bind mounts may cross filesystem boundaries and span
       <a href="chroot.2.html">chroot(2)</a> jails.

       The <i>filesystemtype</i> and <i>data</i> arguments are ignored.

       The remaining bits (other than <b>MS_REC</b>, described below) in the
       <i>mountflags</i> argument are also ignored.  (The bind mount has the
       same mount options as the underlying mount.)  However, see the
       discussion of remounting above, for a method of making an
       existing bind mount read-only.

       By default, when a directory is bind mounted, only that directory
       is mounted; if there are any submounts under the directory tree,
       they are not bind mounted.  If the <b>MS_REC </b>flag is also specified,
       then a recursive bind mount operation is performed: all submounts
       under the <i>source</i> subtree (other than unbindable mounts) are also
       bind mounted at the corresponding location in the <i>target</i> subtree.

   <b>Changing the propagation type of an existing mount</b>
       If <i>mountflags</i> includes one of <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or
       <b>MS_UNBINDABLE </b>(all available since Linux 2.6.15), then the
       propagation type of an existing mount is changed.  If more than
       one of these flags is specified, an error results.

       The only other flags that can be specified while changing the
       propagation type are <b>MS_REC </b>(described below) and <b>MS_SILENT</b>
       (which is ignored).

       The <i>source</i>, <i>filesystemtype</i>, and <i>data</i> arguments are ignored.

       The meanings of the propagation type flags are as follows:

       <b>MS_SHARED</b>
              Make this mount shared.  Mount and unmount events
              immediately under this mount will propagate to the other
              mounts that are members of this mount's peer group.
              Propagation here means that the same mount or unmount will
              automatically occur under all of the other mounts in the
              peer group.  Conversely, mount and unmount events that
              take place under peer mounts will propagate to this mount.

       <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>
              Make this mount private.  Mount and unmount events do not
              propagate into or out of this mount.

       <b>MS_SLAVE</b>
              If this is a shared mount that is a member of a peer group
              that contains other members, convert it to a slave mount.
              If this is a shared mount that is a member of a peer group
              that contains no other members, convert it to a private
              mount.  Otherwise, the propagation type of the mount is
              left unchanged.

              When a mount is a slave, mount and unmount events
              propagate into this mount from the (master) shared peer
              group of which it was formerly a member.  Mount and
              unmount events under this mount do not propagate to any
              peer.

              A mount can be the slave of another peer group while at
              the same time sharing mount and unmount events with a peer
              group of which it is a member.

       <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>
              Make this mount unbindable.  This is like a private mount,
              and in addition this mount can't be bind mounted.  When a
              recursive bind mount (<b>mount</b>() with the <b>MS_BIND </b>and <b>MS_REC</b>
              flags) is performed on a directory subtree, any unbindable
              mounts within the subtree are automatically pruned (i.e.,
              not replicated) when replicating that subtree to produce
              the target subtree.

       By default, changing the propagation type affects only the <i>target</i>
       mount.  If the <b>MS_REC </b>flag is also specified in <i>mountflags</i>, then
       the propagation type of all mounts under <i>target</i> is also changed.

       For further details regarding mount propagation types (including
       the default propagation type assigned to new mounts), see
       <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>.

   <b>Moving a mount</b>
       If <i>mountflags</i> contains the flag <b>MS_MOVE </b>(available since Linux
       2.4.18), then move a subtree: <i>source</i> specifies an existing mount
       and <i>target</i> specifies the new location to which that mount is to
       be relocated.  The move is atomic: at no point is the subtree
       unmounted.

       The remaining bits in the <i>mountflags</i> argument are ignored, as are
       the <i>filesystemtype</i> and <i>data</i> arguments.

   <b>Creating a new mount</b>
       If none of <b>MS_REMOUNT</b>, <b>MS_BIND</b>, <b>MS_MOVE</b>, <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>,
       <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or <b>MS_UNBINDABLE </b>is specified in <i>mountflags</i>, then
       <b>mount</b>() performs its default action: creating a new mount.
       <i>source</i> specifies the source for the new mount, and <i>target</i>
       specifies the directory at which to create the mount point.

       The <i>filesystemtype</i> and <i>data</i> arguments are employed, and further
       bits may be specified in <i>mountflags</i> to modify the behavior of the
       call.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and

ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The error values given below result from filesystem type
       independent errors.  Each filesystem type may have its own
       special errors and its own special behavior.  See the Linux
       kernel source code for details.

       <b>EACCES </b>A component of a path was not searchable.  (See also
              <a href="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution(7)</a>.)

       <b>EACCES </b>Mounting a read-only filesystem was attempted without
              giving the <b>MS_RDONLY </b>flag.

              The filesystem may be read-only for various reasons,
              including: it resides on a read-only optical disk; it is
              resides on a device with a physical switch that has been
              set to mark the device read-only; the filesystem
              implementation was compiled with read-only support; or
              errors were detected when initially mounting the
              filesystem, so that it was marked read-only and can't be
              remounted as read-write (until the errors are fixed).

              Some filesystems instead return the error <b>EROFS </b>on an
              attempt to mount a read-only filesystem.

       <b>EACCES </b>The block device <i>source</i> is located on a filesystem mounted

       <b>EBUSY  </b><i>source</i> cannot be remounted read-only, because it still
              holds files open for writing.

       <b>EFAULT </b>One of the pointer arguments points outside the user

              tree under <i>source</i> includes unbindable mounts and <i>target</i> is
              a mount that has propagation type <b>MS_SHARED</b>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>A move operation (<b>MS_MOVE</b>) was attempted, but the parent

              attempted without specifying (<b>MS_REC</b>), which would have

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       The definitions of <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b>, <b>MS_MOVE</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MS_REC</b>,
       <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b>, and
       <b>MS_UNBINDABLE </b>were added to glibc headers in glibc 2.12.

       Since Linux 2.4 a single filesystem can be mounted at multiple
       mount points, and multiple mounts can be stacked on the same
       mount point.

       The <i>mountflags</i> argument may have the magic number 0xC0ED
       (<b>MS_MGC_VAL</b>) in the top 16 bits.  (All of the other flags
       discussed in DESCRIPTION occupy the low order 16 bits of
       <i>mountflags</i>.)  Specifying <b>MS_MGC_VAL </b>was required before Linux
       2.4, but since Linux 2.4 is no longer required and is ignored if
       specified.

       The original <b>MS_SYNC </b>flag was renamed <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS </b>in 1.1.69
       when a different <b>MS_SYNC </b>was added to <i>&lt;mman.h&gt;</i>.

       Before Linux 2.4 an attempt to execute a set-user-ID or set-
       group-ID program on a filesystem mounted with <b>MS_NOSUID </b>would
       fail with <b>EPERM</b>.  Since Linux 2.4 the set-user-ID and set-group-
       ID bits are just silently ignored in this case.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Mount namespaces</b>
       Starting with Linux 2.4.19, Linux provides mount namespaces.  A
       mount namespace is the set of filesystem mounts that are visible
       to a process.  Mount namespaces can be (and usually are) shared
       between multiple processes, and changes to the namespace (i.e.,
       mounts and unmounts) by one process are visible to all other
       processes sharing the same namespace.  (The pre-2.4.19 Linux
       situation can be considered as one in which a single namespace
       was shared by every process on the system.)

       A child process created by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> shares its parent's mount
       namespace; the mount namespace is preserved across an <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       A process can obtain a private mount namespace if: it was created
       using the <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> <b>CLONE_NEWNS </b>flag, in which case its new
       namespace is initialized to be a <i>copy</i> of the namespace of the
       process that called <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>; or it calls <a href="unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> with the
       <b>CLONE_NEWNS </b>flag, which causes the caller's mount namespace to
       obtain a private copy of the namespace that it was previously
       sharing with other processes, so that future mounts and unmounts
       by the caller are invisible to other processes (except child
       processes that the caller subsequently creates) and vice versa.

       For further details on mount namespaces, see <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>.

   <b>Parental relationship between mounts</b>
       Each mount has a parent mount.  The overall parental relationship
       of all mounts defines the single directory hierarchy seen by the
       processes within a mount namespace.

       The parent of a new mount is defined when the mount is created.
       In the usual case, the parent of a new mount is the mount of the
       filesystem containing the directory or file at which the new
       mount is attached.  In the case where a new mount is stacked on
       top of an existing mount, the parent of the new mount is the
       previous mount that was stacked at that location.

       The parental relationship between mounts can be discovered via
       the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mountinfo</i> file (see below).

   [1m/proc/[24mpid<i>/mounts</i> and <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mountinfo</i>
       The Linux-specific <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mounts</i> file exposes the list of
       mounts in the mount namespace of the process with the specified
       ID.  The <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mountinfo</i> file exposes even more information
       about mounts, including the propagation type and mount ID
       information that makes it possible to discover the parental
       relationship between mounts.  See <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> and <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>
       for details of this file.
