DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Standard description</b>
       (From POSIX.1) The <b>vfork</b>() function has the same effect as
       <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, except that the behavior is undefined if the process
       created by <b>vfork</b>() either modifies any data other than a variable
       of type <i>pid_t</i> used to store the return value from <b>vfork</b>(), or
       returns from the function in which <b>vfork</b>() was called, or calls
       any other function before successfully calling <a href="_exit.2.html">_exit(2)</a> or one of
       the <a href="../man3/exec.3.html">exec(3)</a> family of functions.

   <b>Linux description</b>
       <b>vfork</b>(), just like <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, creates a child process of the
       calling process.  For details and return value and errors, see
       <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.

       <b>vfork</b>() is a special case of <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>.  It is used to create new
       processes without copying the page tables of the parent process.
       It may be useful in performance-sensitive applications where a
       child is created which then immediately issues an <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       <b>vfork</b>() differs from <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> in that the calling thread is
       suspended until the child terminates (either normally, by calling
       <a href="_exit.2.html">_exit(2)</a>, or abnormally, after delivery of a fatal signal), or it
       makes a call to <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.  Until that point, the child shares
       all memory with its parent, including the stack.  The child must
       not return from the current function or call <a href="../man3/exit.3.html">exit(3)</a> (which would
       have the effect of calling exit handlers established by the
       parent process and flushing the parent's <a href="../man3/stdio.3.html">stdio(3)</a> buffers), but
       may call <a href="_exit.2.html">_exit(2)</a>.

       As with <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, the child process created by <b>vfork</b>() inherits
       copies of various of the caller's process attributes (e.g., file
       descriptors, signal dispositions, and current working directory);
       the <b>vfork</b>() call differs only in the treatment of the virtual
       address space, as described above.

       Signals sent to the parent arrive after the child releases the
       parent's memory (i.e., after the child terminates or calls
       <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>).

   <b>Historic description</b>
       Under Linux, <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so
       the only penalty incurred by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> is the time and memory
       required to duplicate the parent's page tables, and to create a
       unique task structure for the child.  However, in the bad old
       days a <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> would require making a complete copy of the
       caller's data space, often needlessly, since usually immediately
       afterward an <a href="../man3/exec.3.html">exec(3)</a> is done.  Thus, for greater efficiency, BSD
       introduced the <b>vfork</b>() system call, which did not fully copy the
       address space of the parent process, but borrowed the parent's
       memory and thread of control until a call to <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> or an exit
       occurred.  The parent process was suspended while the child was
       using its resources.  The use of <b>vfork</b>() was tricky: for example,
       not modifying data in the parent process depended on knowing
       which variables were held in a register.
</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The requirements put on <b>vfork</b>() by the standards are weaker than
       those put on <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, so an implementation where the two are
       synonymous is compliant.  In particular, the programmer cannot
       rely on the parent remaining blocked until the child either
       terminates or calls <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, and cannot rely on any specific
       behavior with respect to shared memory.

       Some consider the semantics of <b>vfork</b>() to be an architectural
       blemish, and the 4.2BSD man page stated: “This system call will
       be eliminated when proper system sharing mechanisms are
       implemented.  Users should not depend on the memory sharing
       semantics of <i>vfork</i> as it will, in that case, be made synonymous
       to <i>fork</i>.”  However, even though modern memory management hardware
       has decreased the performance difference between <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and
       <b>vfork</b>(), there are various reasons why Linux and other systems
       have retained <b>vfork</b>():

       •  Some performance-critical applications require the small
          performance advantage conferred by <b>vfork</b>().

       •  <b>vfork</b>() can be implemented on systems that lack a memory-
          management unit (MMU), but <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> can't be implemented on
          such systems.  (POSIX.1-2008 removed <b>vfork</b>() from the
          standard; the POSIX rationale for the <a href="../man3/posix_spawn.3.html">posix_spawn(3)</a> function
          notes that that function, which provides functionality
          equivalent to <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>+<a href="../man3/exec.3.html">exec(3)</a>, is designed to be implementable
          on systems that lack an MMU.)

       •  On systems where memory is constrained, <b>vfork</b>() avoids the
          need to temporarily commit memory (see the description of
          <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>) in order to execute
          a new program.  (This can be especially beneficial where a
          large parent process wishes to execute a small helper program
          in a child process.)  By contrast, using <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> in this
          scenario requires either committing an amount of memory equal
          to the size of the parent process (if strict overcommitting is
          in force) or overcommitting memory with the risk that a
          process is terminated by the out-of-memory (OOM) killer.

   <b>Linux notes</b>
       Fork handlers established using <a href="../man3/pthread_atfork.3.html">pthread_atfork(3)</a> are not called
       when a multithreaded program employing the NPTL threading library
       calls <b>vfork</b>().  Fork handlers are called in this case in a
       program using the LinuxThreads threading library.  (See
       <a href="../man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads(7)</a> for a description of Linux threading libraries.)

       A call to <b>vfork</b>() is equivalent to calling <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> with <i>flags</i>
       specified as:

            CLONE_VM | CLONE_VFORK | SIGCHLD

STANDARDS </h2>

       None.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       4.3BSD; POSIX.1-2001 (but marked OBSOLETE).  POSIX.1-2008 removes
       the specification of <b>vfork</b>().

       The <b>vfork</b>() system call appeared in 3.0BSD.  In 4.4BSD it was
       made synonymous to <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> but NetBSD introduced it again; see 
       ⟨<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/vfork.html">http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/vfork.html</a>⟩.  In
       Linux, it has been equivalent to <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> until Linux 2.2.0-pre6
       or so.  Since Linux 2.2.0-pre9 (on i386, somewhat later on other
       architectures) it is an independent system call.  Support was
       added in glibc 2.0.112.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       The child process should take care not to modify the memory in
       unintended ways, since such changes will be seen by the parent
       process once the child terminates or executes another program.
       In this regard, signal handlers can be especially problematic: if
       a signal handler that is invoked in the child of <b>vfork</b>() changes
       memory, those changes may result in an inconsistent process state
       from the perspective of the parent process (e.g., memory changes
       would be visible in the parent, but changes to the state of open
       file descriptors would not be visible).

       When <b>vfork</b>() is called in a multithreaded process, only the
       calling thread is suspended until the child terminates or
       executes a new program.  This means that the child is sharing an
       address space with other running code.  This can be dangerous if
       another thread in the parent process changes credentials (using
       <a href="setuid.2.html">setuid(2)</a> or similar), since there are now two processes with
       different privilege levels running in the same address space.  As
       an example of the dangers, suppose that a multithreaded program
       running as root creates a child using <b>vfork</b>().  After the
       <b>vfork</b>(), a thread in the parent process drops the process to an
       unprivileged user in order to run some untrusted code (e.g.,
       perhaps via plug-in opened with <a href="../man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen(3)</a>).  In this case,
       attacks are possible where the parent process uses <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> to map
       in code that will be executed by the privileged child process.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Details of the signal handling are obscure and differ between
       systems.  The BSD man page states: "To avoid a possible deadlock
       situation, processes that are children in the middle of a <b>vfork</b>()
       are never sent <b>SIGTTOU </b>or <b>SIGTTIN </b>signals; rather, output or
       <i>ioctl</i>s are allowed and input attempts result in an end-of-file
       indication."
