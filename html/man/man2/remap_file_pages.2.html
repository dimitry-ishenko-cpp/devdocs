DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Note</b>: this system call was marked as deprecated starting with
       Linux 3.16.  In Linux 4.0, the implementation was replaced by a
       slower in-kernel emulation.  Those few applications that use this
       system call should consider migrating to alternatives.  This
       change was made because the kernel code for this system call was
       complex, and it is believed to be little used or perhaps even
       completely unused.  While it had some use cases in database
       applications on 32-bit systems, those use cases don't exist on
       64-bit systems.

       The <b>remap_file_pages</b>() system call is used to create a nonlinear
       mapping, that is, a mapping in which the pages of the file are
       mapped into a nonsequential order in memory.  The advantage of
       using <b>remap_file_pages</b>() over using repeated calls to <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> is
       that the former approach does not require the kernel to create
       additional VMA (Virtual Memory Area) data structures.

       To create a nonlinear mapping we perform the following steps:

       1. Use <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> to create a mapping (which is initially linear).
          This mapping must be created with the <b>MAP_SHARED </b>flag.

       2. Use one or more calls to <b>remap_file_pages</b>() to rearrange the
          correspondence between the pages of the mapping and the pages
          of the file.  It is possible to map the same page of a file
          into multiple locations within the mapped region.

       The <i>pgoff</i> and <i>size</i> arguments specify the region of the file that
       is to be relocated within the mapping: <i>pgoff</i> is a file offset in
       units of the system page size; <i>size</i> is the length of the region
       in bytes.

       The <i>addr</i> argument serves two purposes.  First, it identifies the
       mapping whose pages we want to rearrange.  Thus, <i>addr</i> must be an
       address that falls within a region previously mapped by a call to
       <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>.  Second, <i>addr</i> specifies the address at which the file
       pages identified by <i>pgoff</i> and <i>size</i> will be placed.

       The values specified in <i>addr</i> and <i>size</i> should be multiples of the
       system page size.  If they are not, then the kernel rounds <i>both</i>
       values <i>down</i> to the nearest multiple of the page size.

       The <i>prot</i> argument must be specified as 0.

       The <i>flags</i> argument has the same meaning as for <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>, but all
       flags other than <b>MAP_NONBLOCK </b>are ignored.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>remap_file_pages</b>() returns 0.  On error, -1 is
       returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EINVAL </b><i>addr</i> does not refer to a valid mapping created with the
              <b>MAP_SHARED </b>flag.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>addr</i>, <i>size</i>, <i>prot</i>, or <i>pgoff</i> is invalid.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 2.5.46, glibc 2.3.3.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Since Linux 2.6.23, <b>remap_file_pages</b>() creates non-linear
       mappings only on in-memory filesystems such as <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a>,
       hugetlbfs or ramfs.  On filesystems with a backing store,
       <b>remap_file_pages</b>() is not much more efficient than using <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>
       to adjust which parts of the file are mapped to which addresses.
