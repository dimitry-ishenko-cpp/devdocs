DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>userfaultfd</b>() creates a new userfaultfd object that can be used
       for delegation of page-fault handling to a user-space
       application, and returns a file descriptor that refers to the new
       object.  The new userfaultfd object is configured using <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>.

       Once the userfaultfd object is configured, the application can
       use <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> to receive userfaultfd notifications.  The reads from
       userfaultfd may be blocking or non-blocking, depending on the
       value of <i>flags</i> used for the creation of the userfaultfd or
       subsequent calls to <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

       The following values may be bitwise ORed in <i>flags</i> to change the
       behavior of <b>userfaultfd</b>():

       <b>O_CLOEXEC</b>
              Enable the close-on-exec flag for the new userfaultfd file
              descriptor.  See the description of the <b>O_CLOEXEC </b>flag in
              <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>.

       <b>O_NONBLOCK</b>
              Enables non-blocking operation for the userfaultfd object.
              See the description of the <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>flag in <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>.

       <b>UFFD_USER_MODE_ONLY</b>
              This is an userfaultfd-specific flag that was introduced
              in Linux 5.11.  When set, the userfaultfd object will only
              be able to handle page faults originated from the user
              space on the registered regions.  When a kernel-originated
              fault was triggered on the registered range with this
              userfaultfd, a <b>SIGBUS </b>signal will be delivered.

       When the last file descriptor referring to a userfaultfd object
       is closed, all memory ranges that were registered with the object
       are unregistered and unread events are flushed.

       Userfaultfd supports three modes of registration:

       <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING </b>(since Linux 4.10)
              When registered with <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING </b>mode,
              user-space will receive a page-fault notification when a
              missing page is accessed.  The faulted thread will be
              stopped from execution until the page fault is resolved
              from user-space by either an <b>UFFDIO_COPY </b>or an
              <b>UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE </b>ioctl.

       <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MINOR </b>(since Linux 5.13)
              When registered with <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MINOR </b>mode,
              user-space will receive a page-fault notification when a
              minor page fault occurs.  That is, when a backing page is
              in the page cache, but page table entries don't yet exist.
              The faulted thread will be stopped from execution until
              the page fault is resolved from user-space by an
              <b>UFFDIO_CONTINUE </b>ioctl.

       <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP </b>(since Linux 5.7)
              When registered with <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP </b>mode, user-
              space will receive a page-fault notification when a write-
              protected page is written.  The faulted thread will be
              stopped from execution until user-space write-unprotects
              the page using an <b>UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT </b>ioctl.

       Multiple modes can be enabled at the same time for the same
       memory range.

       Since Linux 4.14, a userfaultfd page-fault notification can
       selectively embed faulting thread ID information into the
       notification.  One needs to enable this feature explicitly using
       the <b>UFFD_FEATURE_THREAD_ID </b>feature bit when initializing the
       userfaultfd context.  By default, thread ID reporting is
       disabled.

   <b>Usage</b>
       The userfaultfd mechanism is designed to allow a thread in a
       multithreaded program to perform user-space paging for the other
       threads in the process.  When a page fault occurs for one of the
       regions registered to the userfaultfd object, the faulting thread
       is put to sleep and an event is generated that can be read via
       the userfaultfd file descriptor.  The fault-handling thread reads
       events from this file descriptor and services them using the
       operations described in <a href="ioctl_userfaultfd.2.html">ioctl_userfaultfd(2)</a>.  When servicing the
       page fault events, the fault-handling thread can trigger a wake-
       up for the sleeping thread.

       It is possible for the faulting threads and the fault-handling
       threads to run in the context of different processes.  In this
       case, these threads may belong to different programs, and the
       program that executes the faulting threads will not necessarily
       cooperate with the program that handles the page faults.  In such
       non-cooperative mode, the process that monitors userfaultfd and
       handles page faults needs to be aware of the changes in the
       virtual memory layout of the faulting process to avoid memory
       corruption.

       Since Linux 4.11, userfaultfd can also notify the fault-handling
       threads about changes in the virtual memory layout of the
       faulting process.  In addition, if the faulting process invokes
       <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, the userfaultfd objects associated with the parent may
       be duplicated into the child process and the userfaultfd monitor
       will be notified (via the <b>UFFD_EVENT_FORK </b>described below) about
       the file descriptor associated with the userfault objects created
       for the child process, which allows the userfaultfd monitor to
       perform user-space paging for the child process.  Unlike page
       faults which have to be synchronous and require an explicit or
       implicit wakeup, all other events are delivered asynchronously
       and the non-cooperative process resumes execution as soon as the
       userfaultfd manager executes <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>.  The userfaultfd manager
       should carefully synchronize calls to <b>UFFDIO_COPY </b>with the
       processing of events.

       The current asynchronous model of the event delivery is optimal
       for single threaded non-cooperative userfaultfd manager
       implementations.

       Since Linux 5.7, userfaultfd is able to do synchronous page dirty
       tracking using the new write-protect register mode.  One should
       check against the feature bit <b>UFFD_FEATURE_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP</b>
       before using this feature.  Similar to the original userfaultfd
       missing mode, the write-protect mode will generate a userfaultfd
       notification when the protected page is written.  The user needs
       to resolve the page fault by unprotecting the faulted page and
       kicking the faulted thread to continue.  For more information,
       please refer to the "Userfaultfd write-protect mode" section.

   <b>Userfaultfd operation</b>
       After the userfaultfd object is created with <b>userfaultfd</b>(), the
       application must enable it using the <b>UFFDIO_API ioctl</b>(2)
       operation.  This operation allows a two-step handshake between
       the kernel and user space to determine what API version and
       features the kernel supports, and then to enable those features
       user space wants.  This operation must be performed before any of
       the other <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> operations described below (or those
       operations fail with the <b>EINVAL </b>error).

       After a successful <b>UFFDIO_API </b>operation, the application then
       registers memory address ranges using the <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER</b>
       <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> operation.  After successful completion of a
       <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER </b>operation, a page fault occurring in the
       requested memory range, and satisfying the mode defined at the
       registration time, will be forwarded by the kernel to the user-
       space application.  The application can then use various (e.g.,
       <b>UFFDIO_COPY</b>, <b>UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE</b>, or <b>UFFDIO_CONTINUE</b>) <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>
       operations to resolve the page fault.

       Since Linux 4.14, if the application sets the <b>UFFD_FEATURE_SIGBUS</b>
       feature bit using the <b>UFFDIO_API ioctl</b>(2), no page-fault
       notification will be forwarded to user space.  Instead a <b>SIGBUS</b>
       signal is delivered to the faulting process.  With this feature,
       userfaultfd can be used for robustness purposes to simply catch
       any access to areas within the registered address range that do
       not have pages allocated, without having to listen to userfaultfd
       events.  No userfaultfd monitor will be required for dealing with
       such memory accesses.  For example, this feature can be useful
       for applications that want to prevent the kernel from
       automatically allocating pages and filling holes in sparse files
       when the hole is accessed through a memory mapping.

       The <b>UFFD_FEATURE_SIGBUS </b>feature is implicitly inherited through
       <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> if used in combination with <b>UFFD_FEATURE_FORK</b>.

       Details of the various <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> operations can be found in
       <a href="ioctl_userfaultfd.2.html">ioctl_userfaultfd(2)</a>.

       Since Linux 4.11, events other than page-fault may enabled during
       <b>UFFDIO_API </b>operation.

       Up to Linux 4.11, userfaultfd can be used only with anonymous
       private memory mappings.  Since Linux 4.11, userfaultfd can be
       also used with hugetlbfs and shared memory mappings.

   <b>Userfaultfd write-protect mode (since Linux 5.7)</b>
       Since Linux 5.7, userfaultfd supports write-protect mode for
       anonymous memory.  The user needs to first check availability of
       this feature using <b>UFFDIO_API </b>ioctl against the feature bit
       <b>UFFD_FEATURE_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP </b>before using this feature.

       Since Linux 5.19, the write-protection mode was also supported on
       shmem and hugetlbfs memory types.  It can be detected with the
       feature bit <b>UFFD_FEATURE_WP_HUGETLBFS_SHMEM</b>.

       To register with userfaultfd write-protect mode, the user needs
       to initiate the <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER </b>ioctl with mode
       <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP </b>set.  Note that it is legal to monitor
       the same memory range with multiple modes.  For example, the user
       can do <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER </b>with the mode set to
       <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING | UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP</b>.  When
       there is only <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP </b>registered, user-space will
       <i>not</i> receive any notification when a missing page is written.
       Instead, user-space will receive a write-protect page-fault
       notification only when an existing but write-protected page got
       written.

       After the <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER </b>ioctl completed with
       <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP </b>mode set, the user can write-protect any
       existing memory within the range using the ioctl
       <b>UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT </b>where <i>uffdio_writeprotect.mode</i> should be set
       to <b>UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT_MODE_WP</b>.

       When a write-protect event happens, user-space will receive a
       page-fault notification whose <i>uffd_msg.pagefault.flags</i> will be
       with <b>UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP </b>flag set.  Note: since only writes
       can trigger this kind of fault, write-protect notifications will
       always have the <b>UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WRITE </b>bit set along with the
       <b>UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP </b>bit.

       To resolve a write-protection page fault, the user should
       initiate another <b>UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT </b>ioctl, whose
       <i>uffd_msg.pagefault.flags</i> should have the flag
       <b>UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT_MODE_WP </b>cleared upon the faulted page or
       range.

   <b>Userfaultfd minor fault mode (since Linux 5.13)</b>
       Since Linux 5.13, userfaultfd supports minor fault mode.  In this
       mode, fault messages are produced not for major faults (where the
       page was missing), but rather for minor faults, where a page
       exists in the page cache, but the page table entries are not yet
       present.  The user needs to first check availability of this
       feature using the <b>UFFDIO_API </b>ioctl with the appropriate feature
       bits set before using this feature: <b>UFFD_FEATURE_MINOR_HUGETLBFS</b>
       since Linux 5.13, or <b>UFFD_FEATURE_MINOR_SHMEM </b>since Linux 5.14.

       To register with userfaultfd minor fault mode, the user needs to
       initiate the <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER </b>ioctl with mode
       <b>UFFD_REGISTER_MODE_MINOR </b>set.

       When a minor fault occurs, user-space will receive a page-fault
       notification whose <i>uffd_msg.pagefault.flags</i> will have the
       <b>UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_MINOR </b>flag set.

       To resolve a minor page fault, the handler should decide whether
       or not the existing page contents need to be modified first.  If
       so, this should be done in-place via a second, non-userfaultfd-
       registered mapping to the same backing page (e.g., by mapping the
       shmem or hugetlbfs file twice).  Once the page is considered "up
       to date", the fault can be resolved by initiating an
       <b>UFFDIO_CONTINUE </b>ioctl, which installs the page table entries and
       (by default) wakes up the faulting thread(s).

       Minor fault mode supports only hugetlbfs-backed (since Linux
       5.13) and shmem-backed (since Linux 5.14) memory.

   <b>Reading from the userfaultfd structure</b>
       Each <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> from the userfaultfd file descriptor returns one or
       more <i>uffd_msg</i> structures, each of which describes a page-fault
       event or an event required for the non-cooperative userfaultfd
       usage:

           struct uffd_msg {
               __u8  event;            /* Type of event */
               ...
               union {
                   struct {
                       __u64 flags;    /* Flags describing fault */
                       __u64 address;  /* Faulting address */
                       union {
                           __u32 ptid; /* Thread ID of the fault */
                       } feat;
                   } pagefault;

                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */
                       __u32 ufd;      /* Userfault file descriptor
                                          of the child process */
                   } fork;

                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */
                       __u64 from;     /* Old address of remapped area */
                       __u64 to;       /* New address of remapped area */
                       __u64 len;      /* Original mapping length */
                   } remap;

                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */
                       __u64 start;    /* Start address of removed area */
                       __u64 end;      /* End address of removed area */
                   } remove;
                   ...
               } arg;

               /* Padding fields omitted */
           } __packed;

       If multiple events are available and the supplied buffer is large
       enough, <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> returns as many events as will fit in the
       supplied buffer.  If the buffer supplied to <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> is smaller
       than the size of the <i>uffd_msg</i> structure, the <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> fails with
       the error <b>EINVAL</b>.

       The fields set in the <i>uffd_msg</i> structure are as follows:

       <i>event</i>  The type of event.  Depending of the event type, different
              fields of the <i>arg</i> union represent details required for the
              event processing.  The non-page-fault events are generated
              only when appropriate feature is enabled during API
              handshake with <b>UFFDIO_API ioctl</b>(2).

              The following values can appear in the <i>event</i> field:

              <b>UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT </b>(since Linux 4.3)
                     A page-fault event.  The page-fault details are
                     available in the <i>pagefault</i> field.

              <b>UFFD_EVENT_FORK </b>(since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process invokes <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>
                     (or <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> without the <b>CLONE_VM </b>flag).  The event
                     details are available in the <i>fork</i> field.

              <b>UFFD_EVENT_REMAP </b>(since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process invokes
                     <a href="mremap.2.html">mremap(2)</a>.  The event details are available in the
                     <i>remap</i> field.

              <b>UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE </b>(since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process invokes
                     <a href="madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a> with <b>MADV_DONTNEED </b>or <b>MADV_REMOVE</b>
                     advice.  The event details are available in the
                     <i>remove</i> field.

              <b>UFFD_EVENT_UNMAP </b>(since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process unmaps a memory
                     range, either explicitly using <a href="munmap.2.html">munmap(2)</a> or
                     implicitly during <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> or <a href="mremap.2.html">mremap(2)</a>.  The event
                     details are available in the <i>remove</i> field.

       <i>pagefault.address</i>
              The address that triggered the page fault.

       <i>pagefault.flags</i>
              A bit mask of flags that describe the event.  For
              <b>UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT</b>, the following flag may appear:

              <b>UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP</b>
                     If this flag is set, then the fault was a write-
                     protect fault.

              <b>UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_MINOR</b>
                     If this flag is set, then the fault was a minor
                     fault.

              <b>UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WRITE</b>
                     If this flag is set, then the fault was a write
                     fault.

              If neither <b>UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP </b>nor
              <b>UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_MINOR </b>are set, then the fault was a
              missing fault.

       <i>pagefault.feat.pid</i>
              The thread ID that triggered the page fault.

       <i>fork.ufd</i>
              The file descriptor associated with the userfault object
              created for the child created by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.

       <i>remap.from</i>
              The original address of the memory range that was remapped
              using <a href="mremap.2.html">mremap(2)</a>.

       <i>remap.to</i>
              The new address of the memory range that was remapped
              using <a href="mremap.2.html">mremap(2)</a>.

STANDARDS </h2>

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 4.3.

       Support for hugetlbfs and shared memory areas and non-page-fault
       events was added in Linux 4.11
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The userfaultfd mechanism can be used as an alternative to
       traditional user-space paging techniques based on the use of the
       <b>SIGSEGV </b>signal and <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>.  It can also be used to implement
       lazy restore for checkpoint/restore mechanisms, as well as post-
       copy migration to allow (nearly) uninterrupted execution when
       transferring virtual machines and Linux containers from one host
       to another.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_FORK </b>is enabled and a system call from
       the <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> family is interrupted by a signal or failed, a stale
       userfaultfd descriptor might be created.  In this case, a
       spurious <b>UFFD_EVENT_FORK </b>will be delivered to the userfaultfd
       monitor.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The program below demonstrates the use of the userfaultfd
       mechanism.  The program creates two threads, one of which acts as
       the page-fault handler for the process, for the pages in a
       demand-page zero region created using <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>.

       The program takes one command-line argument, which is the number
       of pages that will be created in a mapping whose page faults will
       be handled via userfaultfd.  After creating a userfaultfd object,
       the program then creates an anonymous private mapping of the
       specified size and registers the address range of that mapping
       using the <b>UFFDIO_REGISTER ioctl</b>(2) operation.  The program then
       creates a second thread that will perform the task of handling
       page faults.

       The main thread then walks through the pages of the mapping
       fetching bytes from successive pages.  Because the pages have not
       yet been accessed, the first access of a byte in each page will
       trigger a page-fault event on the userfaultfd file descriptor.

       Each of the page-fault events is handled by the second thread,
       which sits in a loop processing input from the userfaultfd file
       descriptor.  In each loop iteration, the second thread first
       calls <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> to check the state of the file descriptor, and then
       reads an event from the file descriptor.  All such events should
       be <b>UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT </b>events, which the thread handles by
       copying a page of data into the faulting region using the
       <b>UFFDIO_COPY ioctl</b>(2) operation.

       The following is an example of what we see when running the
       program:

           $ <b>./userfaultfd_demo 3</b>
