SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int shmctl(int </b><i>shmid</i><b>, int </b><i>op</i><b>, struct shmid_ds *</b><i>buf</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>shmctl</b>() performs the control operation specified by <i>op</i> on the
       System V shared memory segment whose identifier is given in
       <i>shmid</i>.

       The <i>buf</i> argument is a pointer to a <i>shmid_ds</i> structure, defined in
       <i>&lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</i> as follows:

           struct shmid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm shm_perm;    /* Ownership and permissions */
               size_t          shm_segsz;   /* Size of segment (bytes) */
               time_t          shm_atime;   /* Last attach time */
               time_t          shm_dtime;   /* Last detach time */
               time_t          shm_ctime;   /* Creation time/time of last
                                               modification via shmctl() */
               pid_t           shm_cpid;    /* PID of creator */
               pid_t           shm_lpid;    /* PID of last shmat(2)/shmdt(2) */
               shmatt_t        shm_nattch;  /* No. of current attaches */
               ...
           };

       The fields of the <i>shmid_ds</i> structure are as follows:

       <i>shm_perm</i>
              This is an <i>ipc_perm</i> structure (see below) that specifies
              the access permissions on the shared memory segment.

       <i>shm_segsz</i>
              Size in bytes of the shared memory segment.

       <i>shm_atime</i>
              Time of the last <a href="shmat.2.html">shmat(2)</a> system call that attached this
              segment.

       <i>shm_dtime</i>
              Time of the last <a href="shmdt.2.html">shmdt(2)</a> system call that detached tgis
              segment.

       <i>shm_ctime</i>
              Time of creation of segment or time of the last <b>shmctl</b>()
              <b>IPC_SET </b>operation.

       <i>shm_cpid</i>
              ID of the process that created the shared memory segment.

       <i>shm_lpid</i>
              ID of the last process that executed a <a href="shmat.2.html">shmat(2)</a> or
              <a href="shmdt.2.html">shmdt(2)</a> system call on this segment.

       <i>shm_nattch</i>
              Number of processes that have this segment attached.

       The <i>ipc_perm</i> structure is defined as follows (the highlighted
       fields are settable using <b>IPC_SET</b>):

           struct ipc_perm {
               key_t          __key;    /* Key supplied to shmget(2) */
               uid_t          <b>uid</b>;      /* Effective UID of owner */
               gid_t          <b>gid</b>;      /* Effective GID of owner */
               uid_t          cuid;     /* Effective UID of creator */
               gid_t          cgid;     /* Effective GID of creator */
               unsigned short <b>mode</b>;     /* <b>Permissions </b>+ SHM_DEST and
                                           SHM_LOCKED flags */
               unsigned short __seq;    /* Sequence number */
           };

       The least significant 9 bits of the <i>mode</i> field of the <i>ipc_perm</i>
       structure define the access permissions for the shared memory
       segment.  The permission bits are as follows:
       0400   Read by user
       0200   Write by user
       0040   Read by group
       0020   Write by group
       0004   Read by others
       0002   Write by others

       Bits 0100, 0010, and 0001 (the execute bits) are unused by the
       system.  (It is not necessary to have execute permission on a
       segment in order to perform a <a href="shmat.2.html">shmat(2)</a> call with the <b>SHM_EXEC</b>
       flag.)

       Valid values for <i>op</i> are:

       <b>IPC_STAT</b>
              Copy information from the kernel data structure associated
              with <i>shmid</i> into the <i>shmid_ds</i> structure pointed to by <i>buf</i>.
              The caller must have read permission on the shared memory
              segment.

       <b>IPC_SET</b>
              Write the values of some members of the <i>shmid_ds</i> structure
              pointed to by <i>buf</i> to the kernel data structure associated
              with this shared memory segment, updating also its
              <i>shm_ctime</i> member.

              The following fields are updated: <i>shm_perm.uid</i>,
              <i>shm_perm.gid</i>, and (the least significant 9 bits of)
              <i>shm_perm.mode</i>.

              The effective UID of the calling process must match the
              owner (<i>shm_perm.uid</i>) or creator (<i>shm_perm.cuid</i>) of the
              shared memory segment, or the caller must be privileged.

       <b>IPC_RMID</b>
              Mark the segment to be destroyed.  The segment will
              actually be destroyed only after the last process detaches
              it (i.e., when the <i>shm_nattch</i> member of the associated
              structure <i>shmid_ds</i> is zero).  The caller must be the owner
              or creator of the segment, or be privileged.  The <i>buf</i>
              argument is ignored.

              If a segment has been marked for destruction, then the
              (nonstandard) <b>SHM_DEST </b>flag of the <i>shm_perm.mode</i> field in
              the associated data structure retrieved by <b>IPC_STAT </b>will
              be set.

              The caller <i>must</i> ensure that a segment is eventually
              destroyed; otherwise its pages that were faulted in will
              remain in memory or swap.

              See also the description of
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced</i> in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       <b>IPC_INFO </b>(Linux-specific)
              Return information about system-wide shared memory limits
              and parameters in the structure pointed to by <i>buf</i>.  This
              structure is of type <i>shminfo</i> (thus, a cast is required),
              defined in <i>&lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</i> if the <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>feature test
              macro is defined:

                  struct shminfo {
                      unsigned long shmmax; /* Maximum segment size */
                      unsigned long shmmin; /* Minimum segment size;
                                               always 1 */
                      unsigned long shmmni; /* Maximum number of segments */
                      unsigned long shmseg; /* Maximum number of segments
                                               that a process can attach;
                                               unused within kernel */
                      unsigned long shmall; /* Maximum number of pages of
                                               shared memory, system-wide */
                  };

              The <i>shmmni</i>, <i>shmmax</i>, and <i>shmall</i> settings can be changed via
              <i>/proc</i> files of the same name; see <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> for details.

       <b>SHM_INFO </b>(Linux-specific)
              Return a <i>shm_info</i> structure whose fields contain
              information about system resources consumed by shared
              memory.  This structure is defined in <i>&lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</i> if the
              <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>feature test macro is defined:

                  struct shm_info {
                      int           used_ids; /* # of currently existing
                                                 segments */
                      unsigned long shm_tot;  /* Total number of shared
                                                 memory pages */
                      unsigned long shm_rss;  /* # of resident shared
                                                 memory pages */
                      unsigned long shm_swp;  /* # of swapped shared
                                                 memory pages */
                      unsigned long swap_attempts;
                                              /* Unused since Linux 2.4 */
                      unsigned long swap_successes;
                                              /* Unused since Linux 2.4 */
                  };

       <b>SHM_STAT </b>(Linux-specific)
              Return a <i>shmid_ds</i> structure as for <b>IPC_STAT</b>.  However, the
              <i>shmid</i> argument is not a segment identifier, but instead an
              index into the kernel's internal array that maintains
              information about all shared memory segments on the
              system.

       <b>SHM_STAT_ANY </b>(Linux-specific, since Linux 4.17)
              Return a <i>shmid_ds</i> structure as for <b>SHM_STAT</b>.  However,
              <i>shm_perm.mode</i> is not checked for read access for <i>shmid</i>,
              meaning that any user can employ this operation (just as
              any user may read <i>/proc/sysvipc/shm</i> to obtain the same
              information).

       The caller can prevent or allow swapping of a shared memory
       segment with the following <i>op</i> values:

       <b>SHM_LOCK </b>(Linux-specific)
              Prevent swapping of the shared memory segment.  The caller
              must fault in any pages that are required to be present
              after locking is enabled.  If a segment has been locked,
              then the (nonstandard) <b>SHM_LOCKED </b>flag of the
              <i>shm_perm.mode</i> field in the associated data structure
              retrieved by <b>IPC_STAT </b>will be set.

       <b>SHM_UNLOCK </b>(Linux-specific)
              Unlock the segment, allowing it to be swapped out.

       Before Linux 2.6.10, only a privileged process could employ
       <b>SHM_LOCK </b>and <b>SHM_UNLOCK</b>.  Since Linux 2.6.10, an unprivileged
       process can employ these operations if its effective UID matches
       the owner or creator UID of the segment, and (for <b>SHM_LOCK</b>) the
       amount of memory to be locked falls within the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b>
       resource limit (see <a href="setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit(2)</a>).
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       A successful <b>IPC_INFO </b>or <b>SHM_INFO </b>operation returns the index of
       the highest used entry in the kernel's internal array recording
       information about all shared memory segments.  (This information
       can be used with repeated <b>SHM_STAT </b>or <b>SHM_STAT_ANY </b>operations to
       obtain information about all shared memory segments on the
       system.)  A successful <b>SHM_STAT </b>operation returns the identifier
       of the shared memory segment whose index was given in <i>shmid</i>.
       Other operations return 0 on success.

       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EACCES IPC_STAT </b>or <b>SHM_STAT </b>is requested and <i>shm_perm.mode</i> does
              not allow read access for <i>shmid</i>, and the calling process
              does not have the <b>CAP_IPC_OWNER </b>capability in the user
              namespace that governs its IPC namespace.

       <b>EFAULT </b>The argument <i>op</i> has value <b>IPC_SET </b>or <b>IPC_STAT </b>but the
              address pointed to by <i>buf</i> isn't accessible.

       <b>EIDRM  </b><i>shmid</i> points to a removed identifier.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>shmid</i> is not a valid identifier, or <i>op</i> is not a valid
              operation.  Or: for a <b>SHM_STAT </b>or <b>SHM_STAT_ANY </b>operation,
              the index value specified in <i>shmid</i> referred to an array
              slot that is currently unused.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>(Since Linux 2.6.9), <b>SHM_LOCK </b>was specified and the size
              of the to-be-locked segment would mean that the total
              bytes in locked shared memory segments would exceed the
              limit for the real user ID of the calling process.  This
              limit is defined by the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK </b>soft resource limit
              (see <a href="setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit(2)</a>).

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              <b>IPC_STAT </b>is attempted, and the GID or UID value is too
              large to be stored in the structure pointed to by <i>buf</i>.

       <b>EPERM  IPC_SET </b>or <b>IPC_RMID </b>is attempted, and the effective user
              ID of the calling process is not that of the creator
              (found in <i>shm_perm.cuid</i>), or the owner (found in
              <i>shm_perm.uid</i>), and the process was not privileged (Linux:
              did not have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability).

              Or (before Linux 2.6.9), <b>SHM_LOCK </b>or <b>SHM_UNLOCK </b>was
              specified, but the process was not privileged (Linux: did
              not have the <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK </b>capability).  (Since Linux
              2.6.9, this error can also occur if the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK </b>is
              0 and the caller is not privileged.)
</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux permits a process to attach (<a href="shmat.2.html">shmat(2)</a>) a shared memory
       segment that has already been marked for deletion using
       <i>shmctl(IPC_RMID)</i>.  This feature is not available on other UNIX
       implementations; portable applications should avoid relying on
       it.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4.

       Various fields in a <i>struct shmid_ds</i> were typed as <i>short</i> under
       Linux 2.2 and have become <i>long</i> under Linux 2.4.  To take
       advantage of this, a recompilation under glibc-2.1.91 or later
       should suffice.  (The kernel distinguishes old and new calls by
       an <b>IPC_64 </b>flag in <i>op</i>.)
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>IPC_INFO</b>, <b>SHM_STAT</b>, and <b>SHM_INFO </b>operations are used by the
       <a href="../man1/ipcs.1.html">ipcs(1)</a> program to provide information on allocated resources.
       In the future, these may modified or moved to a <i>/proc</i> filesystem
       interface.
