DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>open</b>() system call opens the file specified by <i>pathname</i>.  If
       the specified file does not exist, it may optionally (if <b>O_CREAT</b>
       is specified in <i>flags</i>) be created by <b>open</b>().

       The return value of <b>open</b>() is a file descriptor, a small,
       nonnegative integer that is an index to an entry in the process's
       table of open file descriptors.  The file descriptor is used in
       subsequent system calls (<a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, <a href="lseek.2.html">lseek(2)</a>, <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>,
       etc.)  to refer to the open file.  The file descriptor returned
       by a successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor
       not currently open for the process.

       By default, the new file descriptor is set to remain open across
       an <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> (i.e., the <b>FD_CLOEXEC </b>file descriptor flag described
       in <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> is initially disabled); the <b>O_CLOEXEC </b>flag, described
       below, can be used to change this default.  The file offset is
       set to the beginning of the file (see <a href="lseek.2.html">lseek(2)</a>).

       A call to <b>open</b>() creates a new <i>open file description</i>, an entry in
       the system-wide table of open files.  The open file description
       records the file offset and the file status flags (see below).  A
       file descriptor is a reference to an open file description; this
       reference is unaffected if <i>pathname</i> is subsequently removed or
       modified to refer to a different file.  For further details on
       open file descriptions, see NOTES.

       The argument <i>flags</i> must include one of the following <i>access</i>
       <i>modes</i>: <b>O_RDONLY</b>, <b>O_WRONLY</b>, or <b>O_RDWR</b>.  These request opening the
       file read-only, write-only, or read/write, respectively.

       In addition, zero or more file creation flags and file status
       flags can be bitwise ORed in <i>flags</i>.  The <i>file creation flags</i> are
       <b>O_CLOEXEC</b>, <b>O_CREAT</b>, <b>O_DIRECTORY</b>, <b>O_EXCL</b>, <b>O_NOCTTY</b>, <b>O_NOFOLLOW</b>,
       <b>O_TMPFILE</b>, and <b>O_TRUNC</b>.  The <i>file status flags</i> are all of the
       remaining flags listed below.  The distinction between these two
       groups of flags is that the file creation flags affect the
       semantics of the open operation itself, while the file status
       flags affect the semantics of subsequent I/O operations.  The
       file status flags can be retrieved and (in some cases) modified;
       see <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> for details.

       The full list of file creation flags and file status flags is as
       follows:

       <b>O_APPEND</b>
              The file is opened in append mode.  Before each <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>,
              the file offset is positioned at the end of the file, as
              if with <a href="lseek.2.html">lseek(2)</a>.  The modification of the file offset and
              the write operation are performed as a single atomic step.

              <b>O_APPEND </b>may lead to corrupted files on NFS filesystems if
              more than one process appends data to a file at once.
              This is because NFS does not support appending to a file,
              so the client kernel has to simulate it, which can't be
              done without a race condition.

       <b>O_ASYNC</b>
              Enable signal-driven I/O: generate a signal (<b>SIGIO </b>by
              default, but this can be changed via <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>) when input
              or output becomes possible on this file descriptor.  This
              feature is available only for terminals, pseudoterminals,
              sockets, and (since Linux 2.6) pipes and FIFOs.  See
              <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> for further details.  See also BUGS, below.

       <b>O_CLOEXEC </b>(since Linux 2.6.23)
              Enable the close-on-exec flag for the new file descriptor.
              Specifying this flag permits a program to avoid additional
              <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> <b>F_SETFD </b>operations to set the <b>FD_CLOEXEC </b>flag.

              Note that the use of this flag is essential in some
              multithreaded programs, because using a separate <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>
              <b>F_SETFD </b>operation to set the <b>FD_CLOEXEC </b>flag does not
              suffice to avoid race conditions where one thread opens a
              file descriptor and attempts to set its close-on-exec flag
              using <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> at the same time as another thread does a
              <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> plus <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.  Depending on the order of
              execution, the race may lead to the file descriptor
              returned by <b>open</b>() being unintentionally leaked to the
              program executed by the child process created by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.
              (This kind of race is in principle possible for any system
              call that creates a file descriptor whose close-on-exec
              flag should be set, and various other Linux system calls
              provide an equivalent of the <b>O_CLOEXEC </b>flag to deal with
              this problem.)

       <b>O_CREAT</b>
              If <i>pathname</i> does not exist, create it as a regular file.

              The owner (user ID) of the new file is set to the
              effective user ID of the process.

              The group ownership (group ID) of the new file is set
              either to the effective group ID of the process (System V
              semantics) or to the group ID of the parent directory (BSD
              semantics).  On Linux, the behavior depends on whether the
              set-group-ID mode bit is set on the parent directory: if
              that bit is set, then BSD semantics apply; otherwise,
              System V semantics apply.  For some filesystems, the
              behavior also depends on the <i>bsdgroups</i> and <i>sysvgroups</i>
              mount options described in <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>.

              The <i>mode</i> argument specifies the file mode bits to be
              applied when a new file is created.  If neither <b>O_CREAT</b>
              nor <b>O_TMPFILE </b>is specified in <i>flags</i>, then <i>mode</i> is ignored
              (and can thus be specified as 0, or simply omitted).  The
              <i>mode</i> argument <b>must </b>be supplied if <b>O_CREAT </b>or <b>O_TMPFILE </b>is
              specified in <i>flags</i>; if it is not supplied, some arbitrary
              bytes from the stack will be applied as the file mode.

              The effective mode is modified by the process's <i>umask</i> in
              the usual way: in the absence of a default ACL, the mode
              of the created file is <i>(mode &amp; ~umask)</i>.

              Note that <i>mode</i> applies only to future accesses of the
              newly created file; the <b>open</b>() call that creates a read-
              only file may well return a read/write file descriptor.

              The following symbolic constants are provided for <i>mode</i>:

              <b>S_IRWXU  </b>00700 user (file owner) has read, write, and
                       execute permission

              <b>S_IRUSR  </b>00400 user has read permission

              <b>S_IWUSR  </b>00200 user has write permission

              <b>S_IXUSR  </b>00100 user has execute permission

              <b>S_IRWXG  </b>00070 group has read, write, and execute
                       permission

              <b>S_IRGRP  </b>00040 group has read permission

              <b>S_IWGRP  </b>00020 group has write permission

              <b>S_IXGRP  </b>00010 group has execute permission

              <b>S_IRWXO  </b>00007 others have read, write, and execute
                       permission

              <b>S_IROTH  </b>00004 others have read permission

              <b>S_IWOTH  </b>00002 others have write permission

              <b>S_IXOTH  </b>00001 others have execute permission

              According to POSIX, the effect when other bits are set in
              <i>mode</i> is unspecified.  On Linux, the following bits are
              also honored in <i>mode</i>:

              <b>S_ISUID  </b>0004000 set-user-ID bit

              <b>S_ISGID  </b>0002000 set-group-ID bit (see <a href="../man7/inode.7.html">inode(7)</a>).

              <b>S_ISVTX  </b>0001000 sticky bit (see <a href="../man7/inode.7.html">inode(7)</a>).

       <b>O_DIRECT </b>(since Linux 2.4.10)
              Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O to and from this
              file.  In general this will degrade performance, but it is
              useful in special situations, such as when applications do
              their own caching.  File I/O is done directly to/from
              user-space buffers.  The <b>O_DIRECT </b>flag on its own makes an
              effort to transfer data synchronously, but does not give
              the guarantees of the <b>O_SYNC </b>flag that data and necessary
              metadata are transferred.  To guarantee synchronous I/O,
              <b>O_SYNC </b>must be used in addition to <b>O_DIRECT</b>.  See NOTES
              below for further discussion.

              A semantically similar (but deprecated) interface for
              block devices is described in <b>raw</b>(8).

       <b>O_DIRECTORY</b>
              If <i>pathname</i> is not a directory, cause the open to fail.
              This flag was added in Linux 2.1.126, to avoid denial-of-
              service problems if <a href="../man3/opendir.3.html">opendir(3)</a> is called on a FIFO or tape
              device.

       <b>O_DSYNC</b>
              Write operations on the file will complete according to
              the requirements of synchronized I/O <i>data</i> integrity
              completion.

              By the time <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> (and similar) return, the output data
              has been transferred to the underlying hardware, along
              with any file metadata that would be required to retrieve
              that data (i.e., as though each <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> was followed by a
              call to <a href="fdatasync.2.html">fdatasync(2)</a>).  <i>See NOTES below</i>.

       <b>O_EXCL </b>Ensure that this call creates the file: if this flag is
              specified in conjunction with <b>O_CREAT</b>, and <i>pathname</i>
              already exists, then <b>open</b>() fails with the error <b>EEXIST</b>.

              When these two flags are specified, symbolic links are not
              followed: if <i>pathname</i> is a symbolic link, then <b>open</b>()
              fails regardless of where the symbolic link points.

              In general, the behavior of <b>O_EXCL </b>is undefined if it is
              used without <b>O_CREAT</b>.  There is one exception: on Linux
              2.6 and later, <b>O_EXCL </b>can be used without <b>O_CREAT </b>if
              <i>pathname</i> refers to a block device.  If the block device is
              in use by the system (e.g., mounted), <b>open</b>() fails with
              the error <b>EBUSY</b>.

              On NFS, <b>O_EXCL </b>is supported only when using NFSv3 or later
              on kernel 2.6 or later.  In NFS environments where <b>O_EXCL</b>
              support is not provided, programs that rely on it for
              performing locking tasks will contain a race condition.
              Portable programs that want to perform atomic file locking
              using a lockfile, and need to avoid reliance on NFS
              support for <b>O_EXCL</b>, can create a unique file on the same
              filesystem (e.g., incorporating hostname and PID), and use
              <a href="link.2.html">link(2)</a> to make a link to the lockfile.  If <a href="link.2.html">link(2)</a>
              returns 0, the lock is successful.  Otherwise, use <a href="stat.2.html">stat(2)</a>
              on the unique file to check if its link count has
              increased to 2, in which case the lock is also successful.

       <b>O_LARGEFILE</b>
              (LFS) Allow files whose sizes cannot be represented in an
              <i>off_t</i> (but can be represented in an <i>off64_t</i>) to be opened.
              The <b>_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE </b>macro must be defined (before
              including <i>any</i> header files) in order to obtain this
              definition.  Setting the <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS </b>feature test
              macro to 64 (rather than using <b>O_LARGEFILE</b>) is the
              preferred method of accessing large files on 32-bit
              systems (see <a href="../man7/feature_test_macros.7.html">feature_test_macros(7)</a>).

       <b>O_NOATIME </b>(since Linux 2.6.8)
              Do not update the file last access time (<i>st_atime</i> in the
              inode) when the file is <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>.

              This flag can be employed only if one of the following
              conditions is true:

              â€¢  The effective UID of the process matches the owner UID
                 of the file.

              â€¢  The calling process has the <b>CAP_FOWNER </b>capability in
                 its user namespace and the owner UID of the file has a
                 mapping in the namespace.

              This flag is intended for use by indexing or backup
              programs, where its use can significantly reduce the
              amount of disk activity.  This flag may not be effective
              on all filesystems.  One example is NFS, where the server
              maintains the access time.

       <b>O_NOCTTY</b>
              If <i>pathname</i> refers to a terminal deviceâ€”see <a href="../man4/tty.4.html">tty(4)</a>â€”it will
              not become the process's controlling terminal even if the
              process does not have one.

       <b>O_NOFOLLOW</b>
              If the trailing component (i.e., basename) of <i>pathname</i> is
              a symbolic link, then the open fails, with the error
              <b>ELOOP</b>.  Symbolic links in earlier components of the
              pathname will still be followed.  (Note that the <b>ELOOP</b>
              error that can occur in this case is indistinguishable
              from the case where an open fails because there are too
              many symbolic links found while resolving components in
              the prefix part of the pathname.)

              This flag is a FreeBSD extension, which was added in Linux
              2.1.126, and has subsequently been standardized in
              POSIX.1-2008.

              See also <b>O_PATH </b>below.

       <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>or <b>O_NDELAY</b>
              When possible, the file is opened in nonblocking mode.
              Neither the <b>open</b>() nor any subsequent I/O operations on
              the file descriptor which is returned will cause the
              calling process to wait.

              Note that the setting of this flag has no effect on the
              operation of <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>, and similar,
              since those interfaces merely inform the caller about
              whether a file descriptor is "ready", meaning that an I/O
              operation performed on the file descriptor with the
              <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>flag <i>clear</i> would not block.

              Note that this flag has no effect for regular files and
              block devices; that is, I/O operations will (briefly)
              block when device activity is required, regardless of
              whether <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>is set.  Since <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>semantics
              might eventually be implemented, applications should not
              depend upon blocking behavior when specifying this flag
              for regular files and block devices.

              For the handling of FIFOs (named pipes), see also <a href="../man7/fifo.7.html">fifo(7)</a>.
              For a discussion of the effect of <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>in
              conjunction with mandatory file locks and with file
              leases, see <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

       <b>O_PATH </b>(since Linux 2.6.39)
              Obtain a file descriptor that can be used for two
              purposes: to indicate a location in the filesystem tree
              and to perform operations that act purely at the file
              descriptor level.  The file itself is not opened, and
              other file operations (e.g., <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, <a href="fchmod.2.html">fchmod(2)</a>,
              <a href="fchown.2.html">fchown(2)</a>, <a href="fgetxattr.2.html">fgetxattr(2)</a>, <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>, <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>) fail with the
              error <b>EBADF</b>.

              The following operations <i>can</i> be performed on the resulting
              file descriptor:

              â€¢  <a href="close.2.html">close(2)</a>.

              â€¢  <a href="fchdir.2.html">fchdir(2)</a>, if the file descriptor refers to a directory
                 (since Linux 3.5).

              â€¢  <a href="fstatfs.2.html">fstatfs(2)</a> (since Linux 3.12).

              â€¢  Duplicating the file descriptor (<a href="dup.2.html">dup(2)</a>, <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>
                 <b>F_DUPFD</b>, etc.).

              â€¢  Getting and setting file descriptor flags (<a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>
                 <b>F_GETFD </b>and <b>F_SETFD</b>).

              â€¢  Retrieving open file status flags using the <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>
                 <b>F_GETFL </b>operation: the returned flags will include the
                 bit <b>O_PATH</b>.

              â€¢  Passing the file descriptor as the <i>dirfd</i> argument of
                 <b>openat</b>() and the other "*at()" system calls.  This
                 includes <a href="linkat.2.html">linkat(2)</a> with <b>AT_EMPTY_PATH </b>(or via procfs
                 using <b>AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW</b>) even if the file is not a
                 directory.

              â€¢  Passing the file descriptor to another process via a
                 UNIX domain socket (see <b>SCM_RIGHTS </b>in <a href="../man7/unix.7.html">unix(7)</a>).

              When <b>O_PATH </b>is specified in <i>flags</i>, flag bits other than
              <b>O_CLOEXEC</b>, <b>O_DIRECTORY</b>, and <b>O_NOFOLLOW </b>are ignored.

              Opening a file or directory with the <b>O_PATH </b>flag requires
              no permissions on the object itself (but does require
              execute permission on the directories in the path prefix).
              Depending on the subsequent operation, a check for
              suitable file permissions may be performed (e.g.,
              <a href="fchdir.2.html">fchdir(2)</a> requires execute permission on the directory
              referred to by its file descriptor argument).  By
              contrast, obtaining a reference to a filesystem object by
              opening it with the <b>O_RDONLY </b>flag requires that the caller
              have read permission on the object, even when the
              subsequent operation (e.g., <a href="fchdir.2.html">fchdir(2)</a>, <a href="fstat.2.html">fstat(2)</a>) does not
              require read permission on the object.

              If <i>pathname</i> is a symbolic link and the <b>O_NOFOLLOW </b>flag is
              also specified, then the call returns a file descriptor
              referring to the symbolic link.  This file descriptor can
              be used as the <i>dirfd</i> argument in calls to <a href="fchownat.2.html">fchownat(2)</a>,
              <a href="fstatat.2.html">fstatat(2)</a>, <a href="linkat.2.html">linkat(2)</a>, and <a href="readlinkat.2.html">readlinkat(2)</a> with an empty
              pathname to have the calls operate on the symbolic link.

              If <i>pathname</i> refers to an automount point that has not yet
              been triggered, so no other filesystem is mounted on it,
              then the call returns a file descriptor referring to the
              automount directory without triggering a mount.
              <a href="fstatfs.2.html">fstatfs(2)</a> can then be used to determine if it is, in
              fact, an untriggered automount point (<b>.f_type ==</b>
              <b>AUTOFS_SUPER_MAGIC</b>).

              One use of <b>O_PATH </b>for regular files is to provide the
              equivalent of POSIX.1's <b>O_EXEC </b>functionality.  This
              permits us to open a file for which we have execute
              permission but not read permission, and then execute that
              file, with steps something like the following:

                  char buf[PATH_MAX];
                  fd = open("some_prog", O_PATH);
                  snprintf(buf, PATH_MAX, "/proc/self/fd/%d", fd);
                  execl(buf, "some_prog", (char *) NULL);

              An <b>O_PATH </b>file descriptor can also be passed as the
              argument of <a href="../man3/fexecve.3.html">fexecve(3)</a>.

       <b>O_SYNC </b>Write operations on the file will complete according to
              the requirements of synchronized I/O <i>file</i> integrity
              completion (by contrast with the synchronized I/O <i>data</i>
              integrity completion provided by <b>O_DSYNC</b>.)

              By the time <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> (or similar) returns, the output data
              and associated file metadata have been transferred to the
              underlying hardware (i.e., as though each <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> was
              followed by a call to <a href="fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a>).  <i>See NOTES below</i>.

       <b>O_TMPFILE </b>(since Linux 3.11)
              Create an unnamed temporary regular file.  The <i>pathname</i>
              argument specifies a directory; an unnamed inode will be
              created in that directory's filesystem.  Anything written
              to the resulting file will be lost when the last file
              descriptor is closed, unless the file is given a name.

              <b>O_TMPFILE </b>must be specified with one of <b>O_RDWR </b>or <b>O_WRONLY</b>
              and, optionally, <b>O_EXCL</b>.  If <b>O_EXCL </b>is not specified, then
              <a href="linkat.2.html">linkat(2)</a> can be used to link the temporary file into the
              filesystem, making it permanent, using code like the
              following:

                  char path[PATH_MAX];
                  fd = open("/path/to/dir", O_TMPFILE | O_RDWR,
                                          S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);

                  /* File I/O on 'fd'... */

                  linkat(fd, "", AT_FDCWD, "/path/for/file", AT_EMPTY_PATH);

                  /* If the caller doesn't have the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH
                     capability (needed to use AT_EMPTY_PATH with linkat(2)),
                     and there is a proc(5) filesystem mounted, then the
                     linkat(2) call above can be replaced with:

                  snprintf(path, PATH_MAX,  "/proc/self/fd/%d", fd);
                  linkat(AT_FDCWD, path, AT_FDCWD, "/path/for/file",
                                          AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW);
                  */

              In this case, the <b>open</b>() <i>mode</i> argument determines the file
              permission mode, as with <b>O_CREAT</b>.

              Specifying <b>O_EXCL </b>in conjunction with <b>O_TMPFILE </b>prevents a
              temporary file from being linked into the filesystem in
              the above manner.  (Note that the meaning of <b>O_EXCL </b>in
              this case is different from the meaning of <b>O_EXCL</b>
              otherwise.)

              There are two main use cases for <b>O_TMPFILE</b>:

              â€¢  Improved <a href="../man3/tmpfile.3.html">tmpfile(3)</a> functionality: race-free creation
                 of temporary files that (1) are automatically deleted
                 when closed; (2) can never be reached via any pathname;
                 (3) are not subject to symlink attacks; and (4) do not
                 require the caller to devise unique names.

              â€¢  Creating a file that is initially invisible, which is
                 then populated with data and adjusted to have
                 appropriate filesystem attributes (<a href="fchown.2.html">fchown(2)</a>,
                 <a href="fchmod.2.html">fchmod(2)</a>, <a href="fsetxattr.2.html">fsetxattr(2)</a>, etc.)  before being atomically
                 linked into the filesystem in a fully formed state
                 (using <a href="linkat.2.html">linkat(2)</a> as described above).

              <b>O_TMPFILE </b>requires support by the underlying filesystem;
              only a subset of Linux filesystems provide that support.
              In the initial implementation, support was provided in the
              ext2, ext3, ext4, UDF, Minix, and tmpfs filesystems.
              Support for other filesystems has subsequently been added
              as follows: XFS (Linux 3.15); Btrfs (Linux 3.16); F2FS
              (Linux 3.16); and ubifs (Linux 4.9)

       <b>O_TRUNC</b>
              If the file already exists and is a regular file and the
              access mode allows writing (i.e., is <b>O_RDWR </b>or <b>O_WRONLY</b>)
              it will be truncated to length 0.  If the file is a FIFO
              or terminal device file, the <b>O_TRUNC </b>flag is ignored.
              Otherwise, the effect of <b>O_TRUNC </b>is unspecified.

   <b>creat()</b>
       A call to <b>creat</b>() is equivalent to calling <b>open</b>() with <i>flags</i>
       equal to <b>O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC</b>.

   <b>openat()</b>
       The <b>openat</b>() system call operates in exactly the same way as
       <b>open</b>(), except for the differences described here.

       The <i>dirfd</i> argument is used in conjunction with the <i>pathname</i>
       argument as follows:

       â€¢  If the pathname given in <i>pathname</i> is absolute, then <i>dirfd</i> is
          ignored.

       â€¢  If the pathname given in <i>pathname</i> is relative and <i>dirfd</i> is the
          special value <b>AT_FDCWD</b>, then <i>pathname</i> is interpreted relative
          to the current working directory of the calling process (like
          <b>open</b>()).

       â€¢  If the pathname given in <i>pathname</i> is relative, then it is
          interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file
          descriptor <i>dirfd</i> (rather than relative to the current working
          directory of the calling process, as is done by <b>open</b>() for a
          relative pathname).  In this case, <i>dirfd</i> must be a directory
          that was opened for reading (<b>O_RDONLY</b>) or using the <b>O_PATH</b>
          flag.

       If the pathname given in <i>pathname</i> is relative, and <i>dirfd</i> is not a
       valid file descriptor, an error (<b>EBADF</b>) results.  (Specifying an
       invalid file descriptor number in <i>dirfd</i> can be used as a means to
       ensure that <i>pathname</i> is absolute.)

   <b>openat2(2)</b>
       The <a href="openat2.2.html">openat2(2)</a> system call is an extension of <b>openat</b>(), and
       provides a superset of the features of <b>openat</b>().  It is
       documented separately, in <a href="openat2.2.html">openat2(2)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>open</b>(), <b>openat</b>(), and <b>creat</b>() return the new file
       descriptor (a nonnegative integer).  On error, -1 is returned and
       <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>open</b>(), <b>openat</b>(), and <b>creat</b>() can fail with the following errors:

       <b>EACCES </b>The requested access to the file is not allowed, or search
              permission is denied for one of the directories in the

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              <i>pathname</i> refers to a regular file that is too large to be
              opened.  The usual scenario here is that an application
              compiled on a 32-bit platform without
              <i>-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64</i> tried to open a file whose size
              exceeds <i>(1&lt;&lt;31)-1</i> bytes; see also <b>O_LARGEFILE </b>above.  This
              is the error specified by POSIX.1; before Linux 2.6.24,
              Linux gave the error <b>EFBIG </b>for this case.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The <b>O_NOATIME </b>flag was specified, but the effective user
              ID of the caller did not match the owner of the file and
              the caller was not privileged.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The operation was prevented by a file seal; see <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

       <b>EROFS  </b><i>pathname</i> refers to a file on a read-only filesystem and

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              <i>pathname</i> refers to an executable image which is currently
              being executed and write access was requested.

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              <i>pathname</i> refers to a file that is currently in use as a

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              <i>pathname</i> refers to a file that is currently being read by
              the kernel (e.g., for module/firmware loading), and write
              access was requested.

</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The (undefined) effect of <b>O_RDONLY | O_TRUNC </b>varies among
       implementations.  On many systems the file is actually truncated.

   <b>Synchronized I/O</b>
       The POSIX.1-2008 "synchronized I/O" option specifies different
       variants of synchronized I/O, and specifies the <b>open</b>() flags
       <b>O_SYNC</b>, <b>O_DSYNC</b>, and <b>O_RSYNC </b>for controlling the behavior.
       Regardless of whether an implementation supports this option, it
       must at least support the use of <b>O_SYNC </b>for regular files.

       Linux implements <b>O_SYNC </b>and <b>O_DSYNC</b>, but not <b>O_RSYNC</b>.  Somewhat
       incorrectly, glibc defines <b>O_RSYNC </b>to have the same value as
       <b>O_SYNC</b>.  (<b>O_RSYNC </b>is defined in the Linux header file
       <i>&lt;asm/fcntl.h&gt;</i> on HP PA-RISC, but it is not used.)

       <b>O_SYNC </b>provides synchronized I/O <i>file</i> integrity completion,
       meaning write operations will flush data and all associated
       metadata to the underlying hardware.  <b>O_DSYNC </b>provides
       synchronized I/O <i>data</i> integrity completion, meaning write
       operations will flush data to the underlying hardware, but will
       only flush metadata updates that are required to allow a
       subsequent read operation to complete successfully.  Data
       integrity completion can reduce the number of disk operations
       that are required for applications that don't need the guarantees
       of file integrity completion.

       To understand the difference between the two types of completion,
       consider two pieces of file metadata: the file last modification
       timestamp (<i>st_mtime</i>) and the file length.  All write operations
       will update the last file modification timestamp, but only writes
       that add data to the end of the file will change the file length.
       The last modification timestamp is not needed to ensure that a
       read completes successfully, but the file length is.  Thus,
       <b>O_DSYNC </b>would only guarantee to flush updates to the file length
       metadata (whereas <b>O_SYNC </b>would also always flush the last
       modification timestamp metadata).

       Before Linux 2.6.33, Linux implemented only the <b>O_SYNC </b>flag for
       <b>open</b>().  However, when that flag was specified, most filesystems
       actually provided the equivalent of synchronized I/O <i>data</i>
       integrity completion (i.e., <b>O_SYNC </b>was actually implemented as
       the equivalent of <b>O_DSYNC</b>).

       Since Linux 2.6.33, proper <b>O_SYNC </b>support is provided.  However,
       to ensure backward binary compatibility, <b>O_DSYNC </b>was defined with
       the same value as the historical <b>O_SYNC</b>, and <b>O_SYNC </b>was defined
       as a new (two-bit) flag value that includes the <b>O_DSYNC </b>flag
       value.  This ensures that applications compiled against new
       headers get at least <b>O_DSYNC </b>semantics before Linux 2.6.33.

   <b>C library/kernel differences</b>
       Since glibc 2.26, the glibc wrapper function for <b>open</b>() employs
       the <b>openat</b>() system call, rather than the kernel's <b>open</b>() system
       call.  For certain architectures, this is also true before glibc
       2.26.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Under Linux, the <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>flag is sometimes used in cases where
       one wants to open but does not necessarily have the intention to
       read or write.  For example, this may be used to open a device in
       order to get a file descriptor for use with <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>.

       Note that <b>open</b>() can open device special files, but <b>creat</b>()
       cannot create them; use <a href="mknod.2.html">mknod(2)</a> instead.

       If the file is newly created, its <i>st_atime</i>, <i>st_ctime</i>, <i>st_mtime</i>
       fields (respectively, time of last access, time of last status
       change, and time of last modification; see <a href="stat.2.html">stat(2)</a>) are set to
       the current time, and so are the <i>st_ctime</i> and <i>st_mtime</i> fields of
       the parent directory.  Otherwise, if the file is modified because
       of the <b>O_TRUNC </b>flag, its <i>st_ctime</i> and <i>st_mtime</i> fields are set to
       the current time.

       The files in the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd</i> directory show the open file
       descriptors of the process with the PID <i>pid</i>.  The files in the
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fdinfo</i> directory show even more information about these
       file descriptors.  See <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> for further details of both of
       these directories.

       The Linux header file <b>&lt;asm/fcntl.h&gt; </b>doesn't define <b>O_ASYNC</b>; the
       (BSD-derived) <b>FASYNC </b>synonym is defined instead.

   <b>Open file descriptions</b>
       The term open file description is the one used by POSIX to refer
       to the entries in the system-wide table of open files.  In other
       contexts, this object is variously also called an "open file
       object", a "file handle", an "open file table entry", orâ€”in
       kernel-developer parlanceâ€”a <i>struct file</i>.

       When a file descriptor is duplicated (using <a href="dup.2.html">dup(2)</a> or similar),
       the duplicate refers to the same open file description as the
       original file descriptor, and the two file descriptors
       consequently share the file offset and file status flags.  Such
       sharing can also occur between processes: a child process created
       via <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> inherits duplicates of its parent's file descriptors,
       and those duplicates refer to the same open file descriptions.

       Each <b>open</b>() of a file creates a new open file description; thus,
       there may be multiple open file descriptions corresponding to a
       file inode.

       On Linux, one can use the <a href="kcmp.2.html">kcmp(2)</a> <b>KCMP_FILE </b>operation to test
       whether two file descriptors (in the same process or in two
       different processes) refer to the same open file description.

   <b>NFS</b>
       There are many infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS,
       affecting amongst others <b>O_SYNC </b>and <b>O_NDELAY</b>.

       On NFS filesystems with UID mapping enabled, <b>open</b>() may return a
       file descriptor but, for example, <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> requests are denied
       with <b>EACCES</b>.  This is because the client performs <b>open</b>() by
       checking the permissions, but UID mapping is performed by the
       server upon read and write requests.

   <b>FIFOs</b>
       Opening the read or write end of a FIFO blocks until the other
       end is also opened (by another process or thread).  See <a href="../man7/fifo.7.html">fifo(7)</a>
       for further details.

   <b>File access mode</b>
       Unlike the other values that can be specified in <i>flags</i>, the
       <i>access mode</i> values <b>O_RDONLY</b>, <b>O_WRONLY</b>, and <b>O_RDWR </b>do not specify
       individual bits.  Rather, they define the low order two bits of
       <i>flags</i>, and are defined respectively as 0, 1, and 2.  In other
       words, the combination <b>O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY </b>is a logical error,
       and certainly does not have the same meaning as <b>O_RDWR</b>.

       Linux reserves the special, nonstandard access mode 3 (binary 11)
       in <i>flags</i> to mean: check for read and write permission on the file
       and return a file descriptor that can't be used for reading or
       writing.  This nonstandard access mode is used by some Linux
       drivers to return a file descriptor that is to be used only for
       device-specific <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> operations.

   <b>Rationale for openat() and other directory file descriptor APIs</b>
       <b>openat</b>() and the other system calls and library functions that
       take a directory file descriptor argument (i.e., <a href="execveat.2.html">execveat(2)</a>,
       <a href="faccessat.2.html">faccessat(2)</a>, <a href="fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a>, <a href="fchmodat.2.html">fchmodat(2)</a>, <a href="fchownat.2.html">fchownat(2)</a>,

       <a href="mknodat.2.html">mknodat(2)</a>, <a href="mount_setattr.2.html">mount_setattr(2)</a>, <b>move_mount</b>(2),
       <a href="name_to_handle_at.2.html">name_to_handle_at(2)</a>, <b>open_tree</b>(2), <a href="openat2.2.html">openat2(2)</a>, <a href="readlinkat.2.html">readlinkat(2)</a>,
       <a href="renameat.2.html">renameat(2)</a>, <a href="renameat2.2.html">renameat2(2)</a>, <a href="statx.2.html">statx(2)</a>, <a href="symlinkat.2.html">symlinkat(2)</a>, <a href="unlinkat.2.html">unlinkat(2)</a>,
       <a href="utimensat.2.html">utimensat(2)</a>, <a href="../man3/mkfifoat.3.html">mkfifoat(3)</a>, and <a href="../man3/scandirat.3.html">scandirat(3)</a>) address two problems
       with the older interfaces that preceded them.  Here, the
       explanation is in terms of the <b>openat</b>() call, but the rationale
       is analogous for the other interfaces.

       First, <b>openat</b>() allows an application to avoid race conditions
       that could occur when using <b>open</b>() to open files in directories
       other than the current working directory.  These race conditions
       result from the fact that some component of the directory prefix
       given to <b>open</b>() could be changed in parallel with the call to
       <b>open</b>().  Suppose, for example, that we wish to create the file
       <i>dir1/dir2/xxx.dep</i> if the file <i>dir1/dir2/xxx</i> exists.  The problem
       is that between the existence check and the file-creation step,
       <i>dir1</i> or <i>dir2</i> (which might be symbolic links) could be modified to
       point to a different location.  Such races can be avoided by
       opening a file descriptor for the target directory, and then
       specifying that file descriptor as the <i>dirfd</i> argument of (say)
       <a href="fstatat.2.html">fstatat(2)</a> and <b>openat</b>().  The use of the <i>dirfd</i> file descriptor
       also has other benefits:

       â€¢  the file descriptor is a stable reference to the directory,
          even if the directory is renamed; and

       â€¢  the open file descriptor prevents the underlying filesystem
          from being dismounted, just as when a process has a current
          working directory on a filesystem.

       Second, <b>openat</b>() allows the implementation of a per-thread
       "current working directory", via file descriptor(s) maintained by
       the application.  (This functionality can also be obtained by
       tricks based on the use of <i>/proc/self/fd/</i>dirfd, but less
       efficiently.)

       The <i>dirfd</i> argument for these APIs can be obtained by using <b>open</b>()
       or <b>openat</b>() to open a directory (with either the <b>O_RDONLY </b>or the
       <b>O_PATH </b>flag).  Alternatively, such a file descriptor can be
       obtained by applying <a href="../man3/dirfd.3.html">dirfd(3)</a> to a directory stream created using
       <a href="../man3/opendir.3.html">opendir(3)</a>.

       When these APIs are given a <i>dirfd</i> argument of <b>AT_FDCWD </b>or the
       specified pathname is absolute, then they handle their pathname
       argument in the same way as the corresponding conventional APIs.
       However, in this case, several of the APIs have a <i>flags</i> argument
       that provides access to functionality that is not available with
       the corresponding conventional APIs.

   <b>O_DIRECT</b>
       The <b>O_DIRECT </b>flag may impose alignment restrictions on the length
       and address of user-space buffers and the file offset of I/Os.
       In Linux alignment restrictions vary by filesystem and kernel
       version and might be absent entirely.  The handling of misaligned
       <b>O_DIRECT </b>I/Os also varies; they can either fail with <b>EINVAL </b>or
       fall back to buffered I/O.

       Since Linux 6.1, <b>O_DIRECT </b>support and alignment restrictions for
       a file can be queried using <a href="statx.2.html">statx(2)</a>, using the <b>STATX_DIOALIGN</b>
       flag.  Support for <b>STATX_DIOALIGN </b>varies by filesystem; see
       <a href="statx.2.html">statx(2)</a>.

       Some filesystems provide their own interfaces for querying
       <b>O_DIRECT </b>alignment restrictions, for example the <b>XFS_IOC_DIOINFO</b>
       operation in <a href="../man3/xfsctl.3.html">xfsctl(3)</a>.  <b>STATX_DIOALIGN </b>should be used instead
       when it is available.

       If none of the above is available, then direct I/O support and
       alignment restrictions can only be assumed from known
       characteristics of the filesystem, the individual file, the
       underlying storage device(s), and the kernel version.  In Linux
       2.4, most filesystems based on block devices require that the
       file offset and the length and memory address of all I/O segments
       be multiples of the filesystem block size (typically 4096 bytes).
       In Linux 2.6.0, this was relaxed to the logical block size of the
       block device (typically 512 bytes).  A block device's logical
       block size can be determined using the <a href="ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> <b>BLKSSZGET</b>
       operation or from the shell using the command:

           blockdev --getss

       <b>O_DIRECT </b>I/Os should never be run concurrently with the <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>
       system call, if the memory buffer is a private mapping (i.e., any
       mapping created with the <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> <b>MAP_PRIVATE </b>flag; this includes
       memory allocated on the heap and statically allocated buffers).
       Any such I/Os, whether submitted via an asynchronous I/O
       interface or from another thread in the process, should be
       completed before <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> is called.  Failure to do so can result
       in data corruption and undefined behavior in parent and child
       processes.  This restriction does not apply when the memory
       buffer for the <b>O_DIRECT </b>I/Os was created using <a href="shmat.2.html">shmat(2)</a> or
       <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> with the <b>MAP_SHARED </b>flag.  Nor does this restriction
       apply when the memory buffer has been advised as <b>MADV_DONTFORK</b>
       with <a href="madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a>, ensuring that it will not be available to the
       child after <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.

       The <b>O_DIRECT </b>flag was introduced in SGI IRIX, where it has
       alignment restrictions similar to those of Linux 2.4.  IRIX has
       also a <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> call to query appropriate alignments, and sizes.
       FreeBSD 4.x introduced a flag of the same name, but without
       alignment restrictions.

       <b>O_DIRECT </b>support was added in Linux 2.4.10.  Older Linux kernels
       simply ignore this flag.  Some filesystems may not implement the
       flag, in which case <b>open</b>() fails with the error <b>EINVAL </b>if it is
       used.

       Applications should avoid mixing <b>O_DIRECT </b>and normal I/O to the
       same file, and especially to overlapping byte regions in the same
       file.  Even when the filesystem correctly handles the coherency
       issues in this situation, overall I/O throughput is likely to be
       slower than using either mode alone.  Likewise, applications
       should avoid mixing <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> of files with direct I/O to the same
       files.

       The behavior of <b>O_DIRECT </b>with NFS will differ from local
       filesystems.  Older kernels, or kernels configured in certain
       ways, may not support this combination.  The NFS protocol does
       not support passing the flag to the server, so <b>O_DIRECT </b>I/O will
       bypass the page cache only on the client; the server may still
       cache the I/O.  The client asks the server to make the I/O
       synchronous to preserve the synchronous semantics of <b>O_DIRECT</b>.
       Some servers will perform poorly under these circumstances,
       especially if the I/O size is small.  Some servers may also be
       configured to lie to clients about the I/O having reached stable
       storage; this will avoid the performance penalty at some risk to
       data integrity in the event of server power failure.  The Linux
       NFS client places no alignment restrictions on <b>O_DIRECT </b>I/O.

       In summary, <b>O_DIRECT </b>is a potentially powerful tool that should
       be used with caution.  It is recommended that applications treat
       use of <b>O_DIRECT </b>as a performance option which is disabled by
       default.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Currently, it is not possible to enable signal-driven I/O by
       specifying <b>O_ASYNC </b>when calling <b>open</b>(); use <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> to enable
       this flag.

       One must check for two different error codes, <b>EISDIR </b>and <b>ENOENT</b>,
       when trying to determine whether the kernel supports <b>O_TMPFILE</b>
       functionality.

       When both <b>O_CREAT </b>and <b>O_DIRECTORY </b>are specified in <i>flags</i> and the
       file specified by <i>pathname</i> does not exist, <b>open</b>() will create a
       regular file (i.e., <b>O_DIRECTORY </b>is ignored).
