       <b>renameat2</b>():

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>rename</b>() renames a file, moving it between directories if
       required.  Any other hard links to the file (as created using
       <a href="link.2.html">link(2)</a>) are unaffected.  Open file descriptors for <i>oldpath</i> are
       also unaffected.

       Various restrictions determine whether or not the rename
       operation succeeds: see ERRORS below.

       If <i>newpath</i> already exists, it will be atomically replaced, so
       that there is no point at which another process attempting to
       access <i>newpath</i> will find it missing.  However, there will
       probably be a window in which both <i>oldpath</i> and <i>newpath</i> refer to
       the file being renamed.

       If <i>oldpath</i> and <i>newpath</i> are existing hard links referring to the
       same file, then <b>rename</b>() does nothing, and returns a success
       status.

       If <i>newpath</i> exists but the operation fails for some reason,
       <b>rename</b>() guarantees to leave an instance of <i>newpath</i> in place.

       <i>oldpath</i> can specify a directory.  In this case, <i>newpath</i> must
       either not exist, or it must specify an empty directory.

       If <i>oldpath</i> refers to a symbolic link, the link is renamed; if
       <i>newpath</i> refers to a symbolic link, the link will be overwritten.

   <b>renameat()</b>
       The <b>renameat</b>() system call operates in exactly the same way as
       <b>rename</b>(), except for the differences described here.

       If the pathname given in <i>oldpath</i> is relative, then it is
       interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file
       descriptor <i>olddirfd</i> (rather than relative to the current working
       directory of the calling process, as is done by <b>rename</b>() for a
       relative pathname).

       If <i>oldpath</i> is relative and <i>olddirfd</i> is the special value
       <b>AT_FDCWD</b>, then <i>oldpath</i> is interpreted relative to the current
       working directory of the calling process (like <b>rename</b>()).

       If <i>oldpath</i> is absolute, then <i>olddirfd</i> is ignored.

       The interpretation of <i>newpath</i> is as for <i>oldpath</i>, except that a
       relative pathname is interpreted relative to the directory
       referred to by the file descriptor <i>newdirfd</i>.

       See <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a> for an explanation of the need for <b>renameat</b>().

   <b>renameat2()</b>
       <b>renameat2</b>() has an additional <i>flags</i> argument.  A <b>renameat2</b>() call
       with a zero <i>flags</i> argument is equivalent to <b>renameat</b>().

       The <i>flags</i> argument is a bit mask consisting of zero or more of
       the following flags:

       <b>RENAME_EXCHANGE</b>
              Atomically exchange <i>oldpath</i> and <i>newpath</i>.  Both pathnames
              must exist but may be of different types (e.g., one could
              be a non-empty directory and the other a symbolic link).

       <b>RENAME_NOREPLACE</b>
              Don't overwrite <i>newpath</i> of the rename.  Return an error if
              <i>newpath</i> already exists.

              <b>RENAME_NOREPLACE </b>can't be employed together with
              <b>RENAME_EXCHANGE</b>.

              <b>RENAME_NOREPLACE </b>requires support from the underlying
              filesystem.  Support for various filesystems was added as
              follows:

              •  ext4 (Linux 3.15);

              •  btrfs, tmpfs, and cifs (Linux 3.17);

              •  xfs (Linux 4.0);

              •  Support for many other filesystems was added in Linux
                 4.9, including ext2, minix, reiserfs, jfs, vfat, and
                 bpf.

       <b>RENAME_WHITEOUT </b>(since Linux 3.18)
              This operation makes sense only for overlay/union
              filesystem implementations.

              Specifying <b>RENAME_WHITEOUT </b>creates a "whiteout" object at
              the source of the rename at the same time as performing
              the rename.  The whole operation is atomic, so that if the
              rename succeeds then the whiteout will also have been
              created.

              A "whiteout" is an object that has special meaning in
              union/overlay filesystem constructs.  In these constructs,
              multiple layers exist and only the top one is ever
              modified.  A whiteout on an upper layer will effectively
              hide a matching file in the lower layer, making it appear
              as if the file didn't exist.

              When a file that exists on the lower layer is renamed, the
              file is first copied up (if not already on the upper
              layer) and then renamed on the upper, read-write layer.
              At the same time, the source file needs to be "whiteouted"
              (so that the version of the source file in the lower layer
              is rendered invisible).  The whole operation needs to be
              done atomically.

              When not part of a union/overlay, the whiteout appears as
              a character device with a {0,0} device number.  (Note that
              other union/overlay implementations may employ different
              methods for storing whiteout entries; specifically, BSD
              union mount employs a separate inode type, <b>DT_WHT</b>, which,
              while supported by some filesystems available in Linux,
              such as CODA and XFS, is ignored by the kernel's whiteout
              support code, as of Linux 4.19, at least.)

              <b>RENAME_WHITEOUT </b>requires the same privileges as creating a
              device node (i.e., the <b>CAP_MKNOD </b>capability).

              <b>RENAME_WHITEOUT </b>can't be employed together with
              <b>RENAME_EXCHANGE</b>.

              <b>RENAME_WHITEOUT </b>requires support from the underlying
              filesystem.  Among the filesystems that support it are
              tmpfs (since Linux 3.18), ext4 (since Linux 3.18), XFS
              (since Linux 4.1), f2fs (since Linux 4.2), btrfs (since
              Linux 4.7), and ubifs (since Linux 4.9).
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
       <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EACCES </b>Write permission is denied for the directory containing
              <i>oldpath</i> or <i>newpath</i>, or, search permission is denied for
              one of the directories in the path prefix of <i>oldpath</i> or
              <i>newpath</i>, or <i>oldpath</i> is a directory and does not allow
              write permission (needed to update the <i>..</i>  entry).  (See
              also <a href="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution(7)</a>.)

       <b>EBUSY  </b>The rename fails because <i>oldpath</i> or <i>newpath</i> is a directory
              that is in use by some process (perhaps as current working
              directory, or as root directory, or because it was open
              for reading) or is in use by the system (for example as a
              mount point), while the system considers this an error.
              (Note that there is no requirement to return <b>EBUSY </b>in such
              cases—there is nothing wrong with doing the rename anyway—
              but it is allowed to return <b>EBUSY </b>if the system cannot
              otherwise handle such situations.)

       <b>EDQUOT </b>The user's quota of disk blocks on the filesystem has been
              exhausted.

       <b>EFAULT </b><i>oldpath</i> or <i>newpath</i> points outside your accessible address
              space.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The new pathname contained a path prefix of the old, or,
              more generally, an attempt was made to make a directory a
              subdirectory of itself.

       <b>EISDIR </b><i>newpath</i> is an existing directory, but <i>oldpath</i> is not a
              directory.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
              <i>oldpath</i> or <i>newpath</i>.

       <b>EMLINK </b><i>oldpath</i> already has the maximum number of links to it, or
              it was a directory and the directory containing <i>newpath</i>
              has the maximum number of links.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              <i>oldpath</i> or <i>newpath</i> was too long.

       <b>ENOENT </b>The link named by <i>oldpath</i> does not exist; or, a directory
              component in <i>newpath</i> does not exist; or, <i>oldpath</i> or
              <i>newpath</i> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The device containing the file has no room for the new
              directory entry.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component used as a directory in <i>oldpath</i> or <i>newpath</i> is
              not, in fact, a directory.  Or, <i>oldpath</i> is a directory,
              and <i>newpath</i> exists but is not a directory.

       <b>ENOTEMPTY </b>or <b>EEXIST</b>
              <i>newpath</i> is a nonempty directory, that is, contains entries
              other than "." and "..".

       <b>EPERM </b>or <b>EACCES</b>
              The directory containing <i>oldpath</i> has the sticky bit
              (<b>S_ISVTX</b>) set and the process's effective user ID is
              neither the user ID of the file to be deleted nor that of
              the directory containing it, and the process is not
              privileged (Linux: does not have the <b>CAP_FOWNER</b>
              capability); or <i>newpath</i> is an existing file and the
              directory containing it has the sticky bit set and the
              process's effective user ID is neither the user ID of the
              file to be replaced nor that of the directory containing
              it, and the process is not privileged (Linux: does not
              have the <b>CAP_FOWNER </b>capability); or the filesystem
              containing <i>oldpath</i> does not support renaming of the type
              requested.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The file is on a read-only filesystem.

       <b>EXDEV  </b><i>oldpath</i> and <i>newpath</i> are not on the same mounted
              filesystem.  (Linux permits a filesystem to be mounted at
              multiple points, but <b>rename</b>() does not work across
              different mount points, even if the same filesystem is
              mounted on both.)

       The following additional errors can occur for <b>renameat</b>() and
       <b>renameat2</b>():

       <b>EBADF  </b><i>oldpath</i> (<i>newpath</i>) is relative but <i>olddirfd</i> (<i>newdirfd</i>) is
              not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              <i>oldpath</i> is relative and <i>olddirfd</i> is a file descriptor
              referring to a file other than a directory; or similar for
              <i>newpath</i> and <i>newdirfd</i>

       The following additional errors can occur for <b>renameat2</b>():

       <b>EEXIST </b><i>flags</i> contains <b>RENAME_NOREPLACE </b>and <i>newpath</i> already
              exists.

       <b>EINVAL </b>An invalid flag was specified in <i>flags</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>Both <b>RENAME_NOREPLACE </b>and <b>RENAME_EXCHANGE </b>were specified
              in <i>flags</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>Both <b>RENAME_WHITEOUT </b>and <b>RENAME_EXCHANGE </b>were specified in
              <i>flags</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The filesystem does not support one of the flags in <i>flags</i>.

       <b>ENOENT </b><i>flags</i> contains <b>RENAME_EXCHANGE </b>and <i>newpath</i> does not exist.

       <b>EPERM  RENAME_WHITEOUT </b>was specified in <i>flags</i>, but the caller
              does not have the <b>CAP_MKNOD </b>capability.

   <b>glibc notes</b>
       On older kernels where <b>renameat</b>() is unavailable, the glibc
       wrapper function falls back to the use of <b>rename</b>().  When <i>oldpath</i>
       and <i>newpath</i> are relative pathnames, glibc constructs pathnames
       based on the symbolic links in <i>/proc/self/fd</i> that correspond to
       the <i>olddirfd</i> and <i>newdirfd</i> arguments.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       On NFS filesystems, you can not assume that if the operation
       failed, the file was not renamed.  If the server does the rename
       operation and then crashes, the retransmitted RPC which will be
       processed when the server is up again causes a failure.  The
       application is expected to deal with this.  See <a href="link.2.html">link(2)</a> for a
       similar problem.
