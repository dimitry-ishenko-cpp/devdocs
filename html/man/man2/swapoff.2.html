</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       swapon, swapoff - start/stop swapping to file/device
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/swap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int swapon(const char *</b><i>path</i><b>, int </b><i>swapflags</i><b>);</b>
       <b>int swapoff(const char *</b><i>path</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>swapon</b>() sets the swap area to the file or block device specified
       by <i>path</i>.  <b>swapoff</b>() stops swapping to the file or block device
       specified by <i>path</i>.

       If the <b>SWAP_FLAG_PREFER </b>flag is specified in the <b>swapon</b>()
       <i>swapflags</i> argument, the new swap area will have a higher priority
       than default.  The priority is encoded within <i>swapflags</i> as:

           <i>(prio &lt;&lt; SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_SHIFT) &amp; SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_MASK</i>

       If the <b>SWAP_FLAG_DISCARD </b>flag is specified in the <b>swapon</b>()
       <i>swapflags</i> argument, freed swap pages will be discarded before
       they are reused, if the swap device supports the discard or trim
       operation.  (This may improve performance on some Solid State
       Devices, but often it does not.)  See also NOTES.

       These functions may be used only by a privileged process (one
       having the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability).

   <b>Priority</b>
       Each swap area has a priority, either high or low.  The default
       priority is low.  Within the low-priority areas, newer areas are
       even lower priority than older areas.

       All priorities set with <i>swapflags</i> are high-priority, higher than
       default.  They may have any nonnegative value chosen by the
       caller.  Higher numbers mean higher priority.

       Swap pages are allocated from areas in priority order, highest
       priority first.  For areas with different priorities, a higher-
       priority area is exhausted before using a lower-priority area.
       If two or more areas have the same priority, and it is the
       highest priority available, pages are allocated on a round-robin
       basis between them.

       As of Linux 1.3.6, the kernel usually follows these rules, but
       there are exceptions.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
       <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EBUSY  </b>(for <b>swapon</b>()) The specified <i>path</i> is already being used as
              a swap area.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The file <i>path</i> exists, but refers neither to a regular file
              nor to a block device;

       <b>EINVAL </b>(<b>swapon</b>()) The indicated path does not contain a valid
              swap signature or resides on an in-memory filesystem such
              as <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              (<b>swapon</b>()) An invalid flag value was specified in
              <i>swapflags</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>(<b>swapoff</b>()) <i>path</i> is not currently a swap area.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
              has been reached.

       <b>ENOENT </b>The file <i>path</i> does not exist.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The system has insufficient memory to start swapping.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability.
              Alternatively, the maximum number of swap files are
              already in use; see NOTES below.

STANDARDS </h2>

       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>swapflags</i> argument was introduced in Linux 1.3.2.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The partition or path must be prepared with <a href="../man8/mkswap.8.html">mkswap(8)</a>.

       There is an upper limit on the number of swap files that may be
       used, defined by the kernel constant <b>MAX_SWAPFILES</b>.  Before Linux
       2.4.10, <b>MAX_SWAPFILES </b>has the value 8; since Linux 2.4.10, it has
       the value 32.  Since Linux 2.6.18, the limit is decreased by 2
       (thus 30), since Linux 5.19, the limit is decreased by 3 (thus:
       29) if the kernel is built with the <b>CONFIG_MIGRATION </b>option
       (which reserves two swap table entries for the page migration
       features of <a href="mbind.2.html">mbind(2)</a> and <a href="migrate_pages.2.html">migrate_pages(2)</a>).  Since Linux 2.6.32,
       the limit is further decreased by 1 if the kernel is built with
       the <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE </b>option.  Since Linux 5.14, the limit is
       further decreased by 4 if the kernel is built with the
       <b>CONFIG_DEVICE_PRIVATE </b>option.  Since Linux 5.19, the limit is
       further decreased by 1 if the kernel is built with the
       <b>CONFIG_PTE_MARKER </b>option.

       Discard of swap pages was introduced in Linux 2.6.29, then made
       conditional on the <b>SWAP_FLAG_DISCARD </b>flag in Linux 2.6.36, which
       still discards the entire swap area when <b>swapon</b>() is called, even
       if that flag bit is not set.
