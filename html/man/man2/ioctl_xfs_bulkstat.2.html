       <b>#include &lt;xfs/xfs_fs.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int ioctl(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, XFS_IOC_BULKSTAT, struct xfs_bulkstat_req</b>
       <b>*</b><i>arg</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Query stat information for a group of XFS inodes.  This ioctl
       uses <b>struct xfs_bulkstat_req </b>to set up a bulk transfer from the
       kernel:

           struct xfs_bulkstat_req {
                struct xfs_bulk_ireq    hdr;
                struct xfs_bulkstat     bulkstat[];
           };

       See below for the <b>xfs_bulkstat </b>structure definition.

           struct xfs_bulk_ireq {
                uint64_t                ino;
                uint32_t                flags;
                uint32_t                icount;
                uint32_t                ocount;
                uint32_t                agno;
                uint64_t                reserved[5];
           };

       <i>hdr.ino</i> should be set to the number of the first inode for which
       the caller wants information; or zero to start with the first
       inode in the filesystem; or a special value if
       <b>XFS_BULK_IREQ_SPECIAL </b>is set in the flags field.  Note that this
       is a different semantic than the <b>lastip </b>in the old <b>FSBULKSTAT</b>
       ioctl.  After the call, this value will be set to the number of
       the next inode for which information could supplied.  This sets
       up the next call for an iteration loop.

       If the <b>XFS_BULK_IREQ_SPECIAL </b>flag is set in the flags field, the
       <i>ino</i> field is interpreted according to the following special
       values:

           <b>XFS_BULK_IREQ_SPECIAL_ROOT</b>
                  Return stat information for the root directory inode.

       <i>hdr.flags</i> is a bit set of operational flags:

           <b>XFS_BULK_IREQ_AGNO</b>
                  If this is set, the call will only return results for
                  the allocation group (AG) set in <b>hdr.agno</b>.  If <b>hdr.ino</b>
                  is set to zero, results will be returned starting with
                  the first inode in the AG.  This flag may not be set
                  at the same time as the <b>XFS_BULK_IREQ_SPECIAL </b>flag.

           <b>XFS_BULK_IREQ_SPECIAL</b>
                  If this is set, results will be returned for only the
                  special inode specified in the <b>hdr.ino </b>field.  This
                  flag may not be set at the same time as the
                  <b>XFS_BULK_IREQ_AGNO </b>flag.

           <b>XFS_BULK_IREQ_NREXT64</b>
                  If this is set, data fork extent count is returned via
                  bs_extents64 field and 0 is assigned to bs_extents.
                  Otherwise, data fork extent count is returned via
                  bs_extents field and bs_extents64 is assigned a value
                  of 0. In the second case, bs_extents is set to (2^31 -
                  1) if data fork extent count is larger than 2^31. This
                  flag may be set independently of whether other flags
                  have been set.

       <i>hdr.icount</i> is the maximum number of records to return.  This
       should be the size of the array that comes after the header.

       <i>hdr.ocount</i> will be set to the number of records actually
       returned.

       <i>hdr.agno</i> is the number of the allocation group (AG) for which we
       want results.  If the <b>XFS_BULK_IREQ_AGNO </b>flag is not set, this
       field is ignored.

       <i>hdr.reserved</i> must be set to zero.

       <i>bulkstat</i> is an array of <b>struct xfs_bulkstat </b>which is described
       below.  The array must have at least <i>icount</i> elements.

           struct xfs_bulkstat {
                uint64_t                bs_ino;

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
XFS INODE METADATA HEALTH REPORTING </h2>
<pre>
       The online filesystem checking utility scans inode metadata and
       records what it finds in the kernel incore state.  The following
       scheme is used for userspace to read the incore health status of
       an inode:

       • If a given sick flag is set in <i>bs_sick</i>, then that piece of
         metadata has been observed to be damaged.  The same bit should
         be set in <i>bs_checked</i>.

       • If a given sick flag is set in <i>bs_checked</i> but is not set in
         <i>bs_sick</i>, then that piece of metadata has been checked and is
         not faulty.

       • If a given sick flag is not set in <i>bs_checked</i>, then no
         conclusion can be made.

       The following flags apply to these fields:

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_INODE</b>
                  The inode's record itself.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_BMBTD</b>
                  File data extent mappings.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_BMBTA</b>
                  Extended attribute extent mappings.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_BMBTC</b>
                  Copy on Write staging extent mappings.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_DIR</b>
                  Directory information.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_XATTR</b>
                  Extended attribute data.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_SYMLINK</b>
                  Symbolic link target.

           <b>XFS_BS_SICK_PARENT</b>
                  Parent pointers.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       <b>EFAULT </b>The kernel was not able to copy into the userspace buffer.
