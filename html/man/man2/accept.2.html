</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>accept</b>() system call is used with connection-based socket
       types (<b>SOCK_STREAM</b>, <b>SOCK_SEQPACKET</b>).  It extracts the first
       connection request on the queue of pending connections for the
       listening socket, <i>sockfd</i>, creates a new connected socket, and
       returns a new file descriptor referring to that socket.  The
       newly created socket is not in the listening state.  The original
       socket <i>sockfd</i> is unaffected by this call.

       The argument <i>sockfd</i> is a socket that has been created with
       <a href="socket.2.html">socket(2)</a>, bound to a local address with <a href="bind.2.html">bind(2)</a>, and is
       listening for connections after a <a href="listen.2.html">listen(2)</a>.

       The argument <i>addr</i> is a pointer to a <i>sockaddr</i> structure.  This
       structure is filled in with the address of the peer socket, as
       known to the communications layer.  The exact format of the
       address returned <i>addr</i> is determined by the socket's address
       family (see <a href="socket.2.html">socket(2)</a> and the respective protocol man pages).
       When <i>addr</i> is NULL, nothing is filled in; in this case, <i>addrlen</i> is
       not used, and should also be NULL.

       The <i>addrlen</i> argument is a value-result argument: the caller must
       initialize it to contain the size (in bytes) of the structure
       pointed to by <i>addr</i>; on return it will contain the actual size of
       the peer address.

       The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided is too
       small; in this case, <i>addrlen</i> will return a value greater than was
       supplied to the call.

       If no pending connections are present on the queue, and the
       socket is not marked as nonblocking, <b>accept</b>() blocks the caller
       until a connection is present.  If the socket is marked
       nonblocking and no pending connections are present on the queue,
       <b>accept</b>() fails with the error <b>EAGAIN </b>or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>.

       In order to be notified of incoming connections on a socket, you
       can use <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, or <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>.  A readable event will
       be delivered when a new connection is attempted and you may then
       call <b>accept</b>() to get a socket for that connection.
       Alternatively, you can set the socket to deliver <b>SIGIO </b>when
       activity occurs on a socket; see <a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket(7)</a> for details.

       If <i>flags</i> is 0, then <b>accept4</b>() is the same as <b>accept</b>().  The
       following values can be bitwise ORed in <i>flags</i> to obtain different
       behavior:

       <b>SOCK_NONBLOCK</b>
              Set the <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>file status flag on the open file
              description (see <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>) referred to by the new file
              descriptor.  Using this flag saves extra calls to <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>
              to achieve the same result.

       <b>SOCK_CLOEXEC</b>
              Set the close-on-exec (<b>FD_CLOEXEC</b>) flag on the new file
              descriptor.  See the description of the <b>O_CLOEXEC </b>flag in
              <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a> for reasons why this may be useful.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, these system calls return a file descriptor for the
       accepted socket (a nonnegative integer).  On error, -1 is
       returned, <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error, and <i>addrlen</i> is left
       unchanged.

   <b>Error handling</b>
       Linux <b>accept</b>() (and <b>accept4</b>()) passes already-pending network
       errors on the new socket as an error code from <b>accept</b>().  This
       behavior differs from other BSD socket implementations.  For
       reliable operation the application should detect the network
       errors defined for the protocol after <b>accept</b>() and treat them
       like <b>EAGAIN </b>by retrying.  In the case of TCP/IP, these are
       <b>ENETDOWN</b>, <b>EPROTO</b>, <b>ENOPROTOOPT</b>, <b>EHOSTDOWN</b>, <b>ENONET</b>, <b>EHOSTUNREACH</b>,
       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>, and <b>ENETUNREACH</b>.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EAGAIN </b>or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The socket is marked nonblocking and no connections are
              present to be accepted.  POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008
              allow either error to be returned for this case, and do
              not require these constants to have the same value, so a
              portable application should check for both possibilities.

       <b>EBADF  </b><i>sockfd</i> is not an open file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNABORTED</b>
              A connection has been aborted.

       <b>EFAULT </b>The <i>addr</i> argument is not in a writable part of the user
              address space.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The system call was interrupted by a signal that was
              caught before a valid connection arrived; see <a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal(7)</a>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>Socket is not listening for connections, or <i>addrlen</i> is
              invalid (e.g., is negative).

       <b>EINVAL </b>(<b>accept4</b>()) invalid value in <i>flags</i>.

       <b>EMFILE </b>The per-process limit on the number of open file
              descriptors has been reached.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
              has been reached.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
       <b>ENOMEM </b>Not enough free memory.  This often means that the memory
              allocation is limited by the socket buffer limits, not by
              the system memory.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The file descriptor <i>sockfd</i> does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The referenced socket is not of type <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>.

       <b>EPERM  </b>Firewall rules forbid connection.

       <b>EPROTO </b>Protocol error.

       In addition, network errors for the new socket and as defined for
       the protocol may be returned.  Various Linux kernels can return
       other errors such as <b>ENOSR</b>, <b>ESOCKTNOSUPPORT</b>, <b>EPROTONOSUPPORT</b>,
       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>.  The value <b>ERESTARTSYS </b>may be seen during a trace.
</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       On Linux, the new socket returned by <b>accept</b>() does <i>not</i> inherit
       file status flags such as <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>and <b>O_ASYNC </b>from the
       listening socket.  This behavior differs from the canonical BSD
       sockets implementation.  Portable programs should not rely on
       inheritance or noninheritance of file status flags and always
       explicitly set all required flags on the socket returned from
       <b>accept</b>().
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>accept</b>()
              POSIX.1-2008.

       <b>accept4</b>()
              Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>accept</b>()
              POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.4BSD (<b>accept</b>() first appeared in
              4.2BSD).

       <b>accept4</b>()
              Linux 2.6.28, glibc 2.10.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       There may not always be a connection waiting after a <b>SIGIO </b>is
       delivered or <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, or <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> return a readability
       event because the connection might have been removed by an
       asynchronous network error or another thread before <b>accept</b>() is
       called.  If this happens, then the call will block waiting for
       the next connection to arrive.  To ensure that <b>accept</b>() never
       blocks, the passed socket <i>sockfd</i> needs to have the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b>
       flag set (see <a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket(7)</a>).

       For certain protocols which require an explicit confirmation,
       such as DECnet, <b>accept</b>() can be thought of as merely dequeuing
       the next connection request and not implying confirmation.
       Confirmation can be implied by a normal read or write on the new
       file descriptor, and rejection can be implied by closing the new
       socket.  Currently, only DECnet has these semantics on Linux.

   <b>The socklen_t type</b>
       In the original BSD sockets implementation (and on other older
       systems) the third argument of <b>accept</b>() was declared as an <i>int *</i>.
       A POSIX.1g draft standard wanted to change it into a <i>size_t *</i>C;
       later POSIX standards and glibc 2.x have <i>socklen_t *</i> .
