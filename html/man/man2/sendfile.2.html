</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sendfile - transfer data between file descriptors
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/sendfile.h&gt;</b>

       <b>ssize_t sendfile(int </b><i>out_fd</i><b>, int </b><i>in_fd</i><b>, off_t *_Nullable </b><i>offset</i><b>,</b>
                        <b>size_t </b><i>count</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sendfile</b>() copies data between one file descriptor and another.
       Because this copying is done within the kernel, <b>sendfile</b>() is
       more efficient than the combination of <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> and <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>,
       which would require transferring data to and from user space.

       <i>in_fd</i> should be a file descriptor opened for reading and <i>out_fd</i>
       should be a descriptor opened for writing.

       If <i>offset</i> is not NULL, then it points to a variable holding the
       file offset from which <b>sendfile</b>() will start reading data from
       <i>in_fd</i>.  When <b>sendfile</b>() returns, this variable will be set to the
       offset of the byte following the last byte that was read.  If
       <i>offset</i> is not NULL, then <b>sendfile</b>() does not modify the file
       offset of <i>in_fd</i>; otherwise the file offset is adjusted to reflect
       the number of bytes read from <i>in_fd</i>.

       If <i>offset</i> is NULL, then data will be read from <i>in_fd</i> starting at
       the file offset, and the file offset will be updated by the call.

       <i>count</i> is the number of bytes to copy between the file
       descriptors.

       The <i>in_fd</i> argument must correspond to a file which supports
       <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>-like operations (i.e., it cannot be a socket).  Except
       since Linux 5.12 and if <i>out_fd</i> is a pipe, in which case
       <b>sendfile</b>() desugars to a <a href="splice.2.html">splice(2)</a> and its restrictions apply.

       Before Linux 2.6.33, <i>out_fd</i> must refer to a socket.  Since Linux
       2.6.33 it can be any file.  If it's seekable, then <b>sendfile</b>()
       changes the file offset appropriately.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the transfer was successful, the number of bytes written to
       <i>out_fd</i> is returned.  Note that a successful call to <b>sendfile</b>()
       may write fewer bytes than requested; the caller should be
       prepared to retry the call if there were unsent bytes.  See also
       NOTES.

       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EAGAIN </b>Nonblocking I/O has been selected using <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>and the
              write would block.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The input file was not opened for reading or the output
              file was not opened for writing.

       <b>EFAULT </b>Bad address.

       <b>EINVAL </b>Descriptor is not valid or locked, or an <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>-like
              operation is not available for <i>in_fd</i>, or <i>count</i> is
              negative.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>out_fd</i> has the <b>O_APPEND </b>flag set.  This is not currently
              supported by <b>sendfile</b>().

       <b>EIO    </b>Unspecified error while reading from <i>in_fd</i>.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory to read from <i>in_fd</i>.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              <i>count</i> is too large, the operation would result in
              exceeding the maximum size of either the input file or the
              output file.

       <b>ESPIPE </b><i>offset</i> is not NULL but the input file is not seekable.
</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Other UNIX systems implement <b>sendfile</b>() with different semantics
       and prototypes.  It should not be used in portable programs.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 2.2, glibc 2.1.

       In Linux 2.4 and earlier, <i>out_fd</i> could also refer to a regular
       file; this possibility went away in the Linux 2.6.x kernel
       series, but was restored in Linux 2.6.33.

       The original Linux <b>sendfile</b>() system call was not designed to
       handle large file offsets.  Consequently, Linux 2.4 added
       <b>sendfile64</b>(), with a wider type for the <i>offset</i> argument.  The
       glibc <b>sendfile</b>() wrapper function transparently deals with the
       kernel differences.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sendfile</b>() will transfer at most 0x7ffff000 (2,147,479,552)
       bytes, returning the number of bytes actually transferred.  (This
       is true on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.)

       If you plan to use <b>sendfile</b>() for sending files to a TCP socket,
       but need to send some header data in front of the file contents,
       you will find it useful to employ the <b>TCP_CORK </b>option, described
       in <a href="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp(7)</a>, to minimize the number of packets and to tune
       performance.

       Applications may wish to fall back to <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> and <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> in the
       case where <b>sendfile</b>() fails with <b>EINVAL </b>or <b>ENOSYS</b>.

       If <i>out_fd</i> refers to a socket or pipe with zero-copy support,
       callers must ensure the transferred portions of the file referred
       to by <i>in_fd</i> remain unmodified until the reader on the other end
       of <i>out_fd</i> has consumed the transferred data.

       The Linux-specific <a href="splice.2.html">splice(2)</a> call supports transferring data
       between arbitrary file descriptors provided one (or both) of them
       is a pipe.
