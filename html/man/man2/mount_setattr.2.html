DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>mount_setattr</b>() system call changes the mount properties of a
       mount or an entire mount tree.  If <i>pathname</i> is a relative
       pathname, then it is interpreted relative to the directory
       referred to by the file descriptor <i>dirfd</i>.  If <i>dirfd</i> is the
       special value <b>AT_FDCWD</b>, then <i>pathname</i> is interpreted relative to
       the current working directory of the calling process.  If
       <i>pathname</i> is the empty string and <b>AT_EMPTY_PATH </b>is specified in
       <i>flags</i>, then the mount properties of the mount identified by <i>dirfd</i>
       are changed.  (See <a href="openat.2.html">openat(2)</a> for an explanation of why the <i>dirfd</i>
       argument is useful.)

       The <b>mount_setattr</b>() system call uses an extensible structure
       (<i>struct mount_attr</i>) to allow for future extensions.  Any non-flag
       extensions to <b>mount_setattr</b>() will be implemented as new fields
       appended to the this structure, with a zero value in a new field
       resulting in the kernel behaving as though that extension field
       was not present.  Therefore, the caller <i>must</i> zero-fill this
       structure on initialization.  See the "Extensibility" subsection
       under <b>NOTES </b>for more details.

       The <i>size</i> argument should usually be specified as <i>sizeof(struct</i>
       <i>mount_attr)</i>.  However, if the caller is using a kernel that
       supports an extended <i>struct mount_attr</i>, but the caller does not
       intend to make use of these features, it is possible to pass the
       size of an earlier version of the structure together with the
       extended structure.  This allows the kernel to not copy later
       parts of the structure that aren't used anyway.  With each
       extension that changes the size of <i>struct mount_attr</i>, the kernel
       will expose a definition of the form <b>MOUNT_ATTR_SIZE_VER</b><i>number</i>.
       For example, the macro for the size of the initial version of
       <i>struct mount_attr</i> is <b>MOUNT_ATTR_SIZE_VER0</b>.

       The <i>flags</i> argument can be used to alter the pathname resolution
       behavior.  The supported values are:

       <b>AT_EMPTY_PATH</b>
              If <i>pathname</i> is the empty string, change the mount
              properties on <i>dirfd</i> itself.

       <b>AT_RECURSIVE</b>
              Change the mount properties of the entire mount tree.

       <b>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</b>
              Don't follow trailing symbolic links.

       <b>AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT</b>
              Don't trigger automounts.

       The <i>attr</i> argument of <b>mount_setattr</b>() is a structure of the
       following form:

           struct mount_attr {
               __u64 attr_set;     /* Mount properties to set */
               __u64 attr_clr;     /* Mount properties to clear */
               __u64 propagation;  /* Mount propagation type */
               __u64 userns_fd;    /* User namespace file descriptor */
           };

       The <i>attr_set</i> and <i>attr_clr</i> members are used to specify the mount
       properties that are supposed to be set or cleared for a mount or
       mount tree.  Flags set in <i>attr_set</i> enable a property on a mount
       or mount tree, and flags set in <i>attr_clr</i> remove a property from a
       mount or mount tree.

       When changing mount properties, the kernel will first clear the
       flags specified in the <i>attr_clr</i> field, and then set the flags
       specified in the <i>attr_set</i> field.  For example, these settings:

           struct mount_attr attr = {
               .attr_clr = MOUNT_ATTR_NOEXEC | MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV,
               .attr_set = MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY | MOUNT_ATTR_NOSUID,
           };

       are equivalent to the following steps:

           unsigned int current_mnt_flags = mnt-&gt;mnt_flags;

           /*
            * Clear all flags set in .attr_clr,
            * clearing MOUNT_ATTR_NOEXEC and MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV.
            */
           current_mnt_flags &amp;= ~attr-&gt;attr_clr;

           /*
            * Now set all flags set in .attr_set,
            * applying MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY and MOUNT_ATTR_NOSUID.
            */
           current_mnt_flags |= attr-&gt;attr_set;

           mnt-&gt;mnt_flags = current_mnt_flags;

       As a result of this change, the mount or mount tree (a) is read-
       only; (b) blocks the execution of set-user-ID and set-group-ID
       programs; (c) allows execution of programs; and (d) allows access
       to devices.

       Multiple changes with the same set of flags requested in <i>attr_clr</i>
       and <i>attr_set</i> are guaranteed to be idempotent after the changes
       have been applied.

       The following mount attributes can be specified in the <i>attr_set</i>
       or <i>attr_clr</i> fields:

       <b>MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY</b>
              If set in <i>attr_set</i>, makes the mount read-only.  If set in
              <i>attr_clr</i>, removes the read-only setting if set on the
              mount.

       <b>MOUNT_ATTR_NOSUID</b>
              If set in <i>attr_set</i>, causes the mount not to honor the set-
              user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits and file capabilities
              when executing programs.  If set in <i>attr_clr</i>, clears the
              set-user-ID, set-group-ID, and file capability restriction
              if set on this mount.

       <b>MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV</b>
              If set in <i>attr_set</i>, prevents access to devices on this
              mount.  If set in <i>attr_clr</i>, removes the restriction that
              prevented accessing devices on this mount.

       <b>MOUNT_ATTR_NOEXEC</b>
              If set in <i>attr_set</i>, prevents executing programs on this
              mount.  If set in <i>attr_clr</i>, removes the restriction that
              prevented executing programs on this mount.

       <b>MOUNT_ATTR_NOSYMFOLLOW</b>
              If set in <i>attr_set</i>, prevents following symbolic links on
              this mount.  If set in <i>attr_clr</i>, removes the restriction
              that prevented following symbolic links on this mount.

       <b>MOUNT_ATTR_NODIRATIME</b>
              If set in <i>attr_set</i>, prevents updating access time for
              directories on this mount.  If set in <i>attr_clr</i>, removes
              the restriction that prevented updating access time for
              directories.  Note that <b>MOUNT_ATTR_NODIRATIME </b>can be
              combined with other access-time settings and is implied by
              the noatime setting.  All other access-time settings are
              mutually exclusive.

       <b>MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME </b>- changing access-time settings
              The access-time values listed below are an enumeration
              that includes the value zero, expressed in the bits
              defined by the mask <b>MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME</b>.  Even though these
              bits are an enumeration (in contrast to the other mount
              flags such as <b>MOUNT_ATTR_NOEXEC</b>), they are nonetheless
              passed in <i>attr_set</i> and <i>attr_clr</i> for consistency with
              <b>fsmount</b>(2), which introduced this behavior.

              Note that, since the access-time values are an enumeration
              rather than bit values, a caller wanting to transition to
              a different access-time setting cannot simply specify the
              access-time setting in <i>attr_set</i>, but must also include
              <b>MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME </b>in the <i>attr_clr</i> field.  The kernel will
              verify that <b>MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME </b>isn't partially set in
              <i>attr_clr</i> (i.e., either all bits in the <b>MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME</b>
              bit field are either set or clear), and that <i>attr_set</i>
              doesn't have any access-time bits set if <b>MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME</b>
              isn't set in <i>attr_clr</i>.

              <b>MOUNT_ATTR_RELATIME</b>
                     When a file is accessed via this mount, update the
                     file's last access time (atime) only if the current
                     value of atime is less than or equal to the file's
                     last modification time (mtime) or last status
                     change time (ctime).

                     To enable this access-time setting on a mount or
                     mount tree, <b>MOUNT_ATTR_RELATIME </b>must be set in
                     <i>attr_set</i> and <b>MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME </b>must be set in the
                     <i>attr_clr</i> field.

              <b>MOUNT_ATTR_NOATIME</b>
                     Do not update access times for (all types of) files
                     on this mount.

                     To enable this access-time setting on a mount or
                     mount tree, <b>MOUNT_ATTR_NOATIME </b>must be set in
                     <i>attr_set</i> and <b>MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME </b>must be set in the
                     <i>attr_clr</i> field.

              <b>MOUNT_ATTR_STRICTATIME</b>
                     Always update the last access time (atime) when
                     files are accessed on this mount.

                     To enable this access-time setting on a mount or
                     mount tree, <b>MOUNT_ATTR_STRICTATIME </b>must be set in
                     <i>attr_set</i> and <b>MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME </b>must be set in the
                     <i>attr_clr</i> field.

       <b>MOUNT_ATTR_IDMAP</b>
              If set in <i>attr_set</i>, creates an ID-mapped mount.  The ID
              mapping is taken from the user namespace specified in
              <i>userns_fd</i> and attached to the mount.

              Since it is not supported to change the ID mapping of a
              mount after it has been ID mapped, it is invalid to
              specify <b>MOUNT_ATTR_IDMAP </b>in <i>attr_clr</i>.

              For further details, see the subsection "ID-mapped mounts"
              under NOTES.

       The <i>propagation</i> field is used to specify the propagation type of
       the mount or mount tree.  This field either has the value zero,
       meaning leave the propagation type unchanged, or it has one of
       the following values:

       <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>
              Turn all mounts into private mounts.

       <b>MS_SHARED</b>
              Turn all mounts into shared mounts.

       <b>MS_SLAVE</b>
              Turn all mounts into dependent mounts.

       <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>
              Turn all mounts into unbindable mounts.

       For further details on the above propagation types, see
       <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>.

              set and the flag is locked.  Mount attributes become
              locked on a mount if:

              â€¢  A new mount or mount tree is created causing mount
                 propagation across user namespaces (i.e., propagation
                 to a mount namespace owned by a different user
                 namespace).  The kernel will lock the aforementioned
                 flags to prevent these sensitive properties from being
                 altered.

              â€¢  A new mount and user namespace pair is created.  This
                 happens for example when specifying <b>CLONE_NEWUSER |</b>
                 <b>CLONE_NEWNS </b>in <a href="unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>, <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>, or <a href="clone3.2.html">clone3(2)</a>.  The
                 aforementioned flags become locked in the new mount
                 namespace to prevent sensitive mount properties from
                 being altered.  Since the newly created mount namespace
                 will be owned by the newly created user namespace, a
                 calling process that is privileged in the new user
                 namespace wouldâ€”in the absence of such lockingâ€”be able
                 to alter sensitive mount properties (e.g., to remount a
                 mount that was marked read-only as read-write in the
                 new mount namespace).

       <b>EPERM  </b>A valid file descriptor value was specified in <i>userns_fd</i>,
              but the file descriptor refers to the initial user
              namespace.

       <b>EPERM  </b>An attempt was made to add an ID mapping to a mount that
              is already ID mapped.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>in the initial user
              namespace.

   <b>ID-mapped mounts</b>
       Creating an ID-mapped mount makes it possible to change the
       ownership of all files located under a mount.  Thus, ID-mapped
       mounts make it possible to change ownership in a temporary and
       localized way.  It is a localized change because the ownership
       changes are visible only via a specific mount.  All other users
       and locations where the filesystem is exposed are unaffected.  It
       is a temporary change because the ownership changes are tied to
       the lifetime of the mount.

       Whenever callers interact with the filesystem through an ID-
       mapped mount, the ID mapping of the mount will be applied to user
       and group IDs associated with filesystem objects.  This
       encompasses the user and group IDs associated with inodes and
       also the following <a href="../man7/xattr.7.html">xattr(7)</a> keys:

       â€¢  <i>security.capability</i>, whenever filesystem capabilities are
          stored or returned in the <b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_3 </b>format, which
          stores a root user ID alongside the capabilities (see
          <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>).

       â€¢  <i>system.posix_acl_access</i> and <i>system.posix_acl_default</i>, whenever
          user IDs or group IDs are stored in <b>ACL_USER </b>or <b>ACL_GROUP</b>
          entries.

       The following conditions must be met in order to create an ID-
       mapped mount:

       â€¢  The caller must have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability in the user
          namespace the filesystem was mounted in.

       â€¢  The underlying filesystem must support ID-mapped mounts.
          Currently, the following filesystems support ID-mapped mounts:

          â€¢  <a href="../man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a> (since Linux 5.12)
          â€¢  <a href="../man5/ext4.5.html">ext4(5)</a> (since Linux 5.12)
          â€¢  <b>FAT </b>(since Linux 5.12)
          â€¢  <b>btrfs</b>(5) (since Linux 5.15)
          â€¢  <b>ntfs3 </b>(since Linux 5.15)
          â€¢  <b>f2fs </b>(since Linux 5.18)
          â€¢  <b>erofs </b>(since Linux 5.19)
          â€¢  <b>overlayfs </b>(ID-mapped lower and upper layers supported since

       â€¢  The mount must not already be ID-mapped.  This also implies
          that the ID mapping of a mount cannot be altered.

       â€¢  The mount must not have any writers.

       â€¢  The mount must be a detached mount; that is, it must have been
          created by calling <b>open_tree</b>(2) with the <b>OPEN_TREE_CLONE </b>flag
          and it must not already have been visible in a mount
          namespace.  (To put things another way: the mount must not
          have been attached to the filesystem hierarchy with a system
          call such as <b>move_mount</b>(2).)

       ID mappings can be created for user IDs, group IDs, and project
       IDs.  An ID mapping is essentially a mapping of a range of user
       or group IDs into another or the same range of user or group IDs.
       ID mappings are written to map files as three numbers separated
       by white space.  The first two numbers specify the starting user
       or group ID in each of the two user namespaces.  The third number
       specifies the range of the ID mapping.  For example, a mapping
       for user IDs such as "1000 1001 1" would indicate that user ID
       1000 in the caller's user namespace is mapped to user ID 1001 in
       its ancestor user namespace.  Since the map range is 1, only user
       ID 1000 is mapped.

       It is possible to specify up to 340 ID mappings for each ID
       mapping type.  If any user IDs or group IDs are not mapped, all
       files owned by that unmapped user or group ID will appear as
       being owned by the overflow user ID or overflow group ID
       respectively.

       Further details on setting up ID mappings can be found in
       <a href="../man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user_namespaces(7)</a>.

       In the common case, the user namespace passed in <i>userns_fd</i>
       (together with <b>MOUNT_ATTR_IDMAP </b>in <i>attr_set</i>) to create an ID-
       mapped mount will be the user namespace of a container.  In other
       scenarios it will be a dedicated user namespace associated with a
       user's login session as is the case for portable home directories
       in <a href="../man8/systemd-homed.service.8.html">systemd-homed.service(8)</a>).  It is also perfectly fine to
       create a dedicated user namespace for the sake of ID mapping a
       mount.

       ID-mapped mounts can be useful in the following and a variety of
       other scenarios:

       â€¢  Sharing files or filesystems between multiple users or
          multiple machines, especially in complex scenarios.  For
          example, ID-mapped mounts are used to implement portable home
          directories in <a href="../man8/systemd-homed.service.8.html">systemd-homed.service(8)</a>, where they allow
          users to move their home directory to an external storage
          device and use it on multiple computers where they are
          assigned different user IDs and group IDs.  This effectively
          makes it possible to assign random user IDs and group IDs at
          login time.

       â€¢  Sharing files or filesystems from the host with unprivileged
          containers.  This allows a user to avoid having to change
          ownership permanently through <a href="chown.2.html">chown(2)</a>.

       â€¢  ID mapping a container's root filesystem.  Users don't need to
          change ownership permanently through <a href="chown.2.html">chown(2)</a>.  Especially for
          large root filesystems, using <a href="chown.2.html">chown(2)</a> can be prohibitively
          expensive.

       â€¢  Sharing files or filesystems between containers with non-
          overlapping ID mappings.

       â€¢  Implementing discretionary access (DAC) permission checking
          for filesystems lacking a concept of ownership.

       â€¢  Efficiently changing ownership on a per-mount basis.  In
          contrast to <a href="chown.2.html">chown(2)</a>, changing ownership of large sets of
          files is instantaneous with ID-mapped mounts.  This is
          especially useful when ownership of an entire root filesystem
          of a virtual machine or container is to be changed as
          mentioned above.  With ID-mapped mounts, a single
          <b>mount_setattr</b>() system call will be sufficient to change the
          ownership of all files.

       â€¢  Taking the current ownership into account.  ID mappings
          specify precisely what a user or group ID is supposed to be
          mapped to.  This contrasts with the <a href="chown.2.html">chown(2)</a> system call which
          cannot by itself take the current ownership of the files it
          changes into account.  It simply changes the ownership to the
          specified user ID and group ID.

       â€¢  Locally and temporarily restricted ownership changes.  ID-
          mapped mounts make it possible to change ownership locally,
          restricting the ownership changes to specific mounts, and
          temporarily as the ownership changes only apply as long as the
          mount exists.  By contrast, changing ownership via the
          <a href="chown.2.html">chown(2)</a> system call changes the ownership globally and
          permanently.

   <b>Extensibility</b>
       In order to allow for future extensibility, <b>mount_setattr</b>()
       requires the user-space application to specify the size of the
       <i>mount_attr</i> structure that it is passing.  By providing this
       information, it is possible for <b>mount_setattr</b>() to provide both
       forwards- and backwards-compatibility, with <i>size</i> acting as an
       implicit version number.  (Because new extension fields will
       always be appended, the structure size will always increase.)
       This extensibility design is very similar to other system calls
       such as <b>perf_setattr</b>(2), <a href="perf_event_open.2.html">perf_event_open(2)</a>, <a href="clone3.2.html">clone3(2)</a> and
       <a href="openat2.2.html">openat2(2)</a>.

       Let <i>usize</i> be the size of the structure as specified by the user-
       space application, and let <i>ksize</i> be the size of the structure
       which the kernel supports, then there are three cases to
       consider:

       â€¢  If <i>ksize</i> equals <i>usize</i>, then there is no version mismatch and
          <i>attr</i> can be used verbatim.

       â€¢  If <i>ksize</i> is larger than <i>usize</i>, then there are some extension
          fields that the kernel supports which the user-space
          application is unaware of.  Because a zero value in any added
          extension field signifies a no-op, the kernel treats all of
          the extension fields not provided by the user-space
          application as having zero values.  This provides backwards-
          compatibility.

       â€¢  If <i>ksize</i> is smaller than <i>usize</i>, then there are some extension
          fields which the user-space application is aware of but which
          the kernel does not support.  Because any extension field must
          have its zero values signify a no-op, the kernel can safely
          ignore the unsupported extension fields if they are all zero.
          If any unsupported extension fields are non-zero, then -1 is
          returned and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to <b>E2BIG</b>.  This provides forwards-
          compatibility.

       Because the definition of <i>struct mount_attr</i> may change in the
       future (with new fields being added when system headers are
       updated), user-space applications should zero-fill <i>struct</i>
       <i>mount_attr</i> to ensure that recompiling the program with new
       headers will not result in spurious errors at run time.  The
       simplest way is to use a designated initializer:

           struct mount_attr attr = {
               .attr_set = MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY,
               .attr_clr = MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV
           };

       Alternatively, the structure can be zero-filled using <a href="../man3/memset.3.html">memset(3)</a>
       or similar functions:

           struct mount_attr attr;
           memset(&amp;attr, 0, sizeof(attr));
           attr.attr_set = MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY;
           attr.attr_clr = MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV;

       A user-space application that wishes to determine which
       extensions the running kernel supports can do so by conducting a
       binary search on <i>size</i> with a structure which has every byte
       nonzero (to find the largest value which doesn't produce an error
       of <b>E2BIG</b>).
