<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;linux/landlock.h&gt;  </b>/* Definition of <b>LANDLOCK_* </b>constants */
       <b>#include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;     </b>/* Definition of <b>SYS_* </b>constants */

       <b>int syscall(SYS_landlock_restrict_self, int </b><i>ruleset_fd</i><b>,</b>
                   <b>uint32_t </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Once a Landlock ruleset is populated with the desired rules, the
       <b>landlock_restrict_self</b>() system call enables enforcing this
       ruleset on the calling thread.  See <a href="../man7/landlock.7.html">landlock(7)</a> for a global
       overview.

       A thread can be restricted with multiple rulesets that are then
       composed together to form the thread's Landlock domain.  This can
       be seen as a stack of rulesets but it is implemented in a more
       efficient way.  A domain can only be updated in such a way that
       the constraints of each past and future composed rulesets will
       restrict the thread and its future children for their entire
       life.  It is then possible to gradually enforce tailored access
       control policies with multiple independent rulesets coming from
       different sources (e.g., init system configuration, user session
       policy, built-in application policy).  However, most applications
       should only need one call to <b>landlock_restrict_self</b>() and they
       should avoid arbitrary numbers of such calls because of the
       composed rulesets limit.  Instead, developers are encouraged to
       build a tailored ruleset thanks to multiple calls to
       <a href="landlock_add_rule.2.html">landlock_add_rule(2)</a>.

       In order to enforce a ruleset, either the caller must have the
       <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability in its user namespace, or the thread
       must already have the <i>no_new_privs</i> bit set.  As for <a href="seccomp.2.html">seccomp(2)</a>,
       this avoids scenarios where unprivileged processes can affect the
       behavior of privileged children (e.g., because of set-user-ID
       binaries).  If that bit was not already set by an ancestor of
       this thread, the thread must make the following call:

              prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1, 0, 0, 0);

       <i>ruleset_fd</i> is a Landlock ruleset file descriptor obtained with
       <a href="landlock_create_ruleset.2.html">landlock_create_ruleset(2)</a> and fully populated with a set of
       calls to <a href="landlock_add_rule.2.html">landlock_add_rule(2)</a>.

       <i>flags</i> must be 0.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>landlock_restrict_self</b>() returns 0.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>landlock_restrict_self</b>() can fail for the following reasons:

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              Landlock is supported by the kernel but disabled at boot
              time.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>flags</i> is not 0.

       <b>EBADF  </b><i>ruleset_fd</i> is not a file descriptor for the current
              thread.

       <b>EBADFD </b><i>ruleset_fd</i> is not a ruleset file descriptor.

       <b>EPERM  </b><i>ruleset_fd</i> has no read access to the underlying ruleset,
              or the calling thread is not running with <i>no_new_privs</i>, or
              it doesn't have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>in its user namespace.

       <b>E2BIG  </b>The maximum number of composed rulesets is reached for the
              calling thread.  This limit is currently 64.
