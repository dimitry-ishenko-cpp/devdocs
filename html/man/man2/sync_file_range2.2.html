NAME </h2>

LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)

<pre>
       <b>#define _GNU_SOURCE         </b>/* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       <b>#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64</b>

       <b>int sync_file_range(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, off_t </b><i>offset</i><b>, off_t </b><i>nbytes</i><b>,</b>
                           <b>unsigned int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sync_file_range</b>() permits fine control when synchronizing the
       open file referred to by the file descriptor <i>fd</i> with disk.

       <i>offset</i> is the starting byte of the file range to be synchronized.
       <i>nbytes</i> specifies the length of the range to be synchronized, in
       bytes; if <i>nbytes</i> is zero, then all bytes from <i>offset</i> through to
       the end of file are synchronized.  Synchronization is in units of
       the system page size: <i>offset</i> is rounded down to a page boundary;
       <i>(offset+nbytes-1)</i> is rounded up to a page boundary.

       The <i>flags</i> bit-mask argument can include any of the following
       values:

       <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE</b>
              Wait upon write-out of all pages in the specified range
              that have already been submitted to the device driver for
              write-out before performing any write.

       <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE</b>
              Initiate write-out of all dirty pages in the specified
              range which are not presently submitted write-out.  Note
              that even this may block if you attempt to write more than
              request queue size.

       <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER</b>
              Wait upon write-out of all pages in the range after
              performing any write.

       Specifying <i>flags</i> as 0 is permitted, as a no-op.

   <b>Warning</b>
       This system call is extremely dangerous and should not be used in
       portable programs.  None of these operations writes out the
       file's metadata.  Therefore, unless the application is strictly
       performing overwrites of already-instantiated disk blocks, there
       are no guarantees that the data will be available after a crash.
       There is no user interface to know if a write is purely an
       overwrite.  On filesystems using copy-on-write semantics (e.g.,
       <i>btrfs</i>) an overwrite of existing allocated blocks is impossible.
       When writing into preallocated space, many filesystems also
       require calls into the block allocator, which this system call
       does not sync out to disk.  This system call does not flush disk
       write caches and thus does not provide any data integrity on
       systems with volatile disk write caches.

   <b>Some details</b>
       <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE </b>and <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER </b>will
       detect any I/O errors or <b>ENOSPC </b>conditions and will return these
       to the caller.

       Useful combinations of the <i>flags</i> bits are:

       <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE | SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE</b>
              Ensures that all pages in the specified range which were
              dirty when <b>sync_file_range</b>() was called are placed under
              write-out.  This is a start-write-for-data-integrity
              operation.

       <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE</b>
              Start write-out of all dirty pages in the specified range
              which are not presently under write-out.  This is an
              asynchronous flush-to-disk operation.  This is not
              suitable for data integrity operations.

       <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE </b>(or <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER</b>)
              Wait for completion of write-out of all pages in the
              specified range.  This can be used after an earlier
              <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE | SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE</b>
              operation to wait for completion of that operation, and
              obtain its result.

       <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE | SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE |</b>
       <b>SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER</b>
              This is a write-for-data-integrity operation that will
              ensure that all pages in the specified range which were
              dirty when <b>sync_file_range</b>() was called are committed to
              disk.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>sync_file_range</b>() returns 0; on failure -1 is
       returned and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EBADF  </b><i>fd</i> is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>flags</i> specifies an invalid bit; or <i>offset</i> or <i>nbytes</i> is
              invalid.

       <b>EIO    </b>I/O error.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Out of memory.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>Out of disk space.

       <b>ESPIPE </b><i>fd</i> refers to something other than a regular file, a block
              device, or a directory.
</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>sync_file_range2()</b>
       Some architectures (e.g., PowerPC, ARM) need 64-bit arguments to
       be aligned in a suitable pair of registers.  On such
       architectures, the call signature of <b>sync_file_range</b>() shown in
       the SYNOPSIS would force a register to be wasted as padding
       between the <i>fd</i> and <i>offset</i> arguments.  (See <a href="syscall.2.html">syscall(2)</a> for
       details.)  Therefore, these architectures define a different
       system call that orders the arguments suitably:

           <b>int sync_file_range2(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, unsigned int </b><i>flags</i><b>,</b>
                                <b>off_t </b><i>offset</i><b>, off_t </b><i>nbytes</i><b>);</b>

       The behavior of this system call is otherwise exactly the same as
       <b>sync_file_range</b>().

STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 2.6.17.

   <b>sync_file_range2()</b>
       A system call with this signature first appeared on the ARM
       architecture in Linux 2.6.20, with the name
       <b>arm_sync_file_range</b>().  It was renamed in Linux 2.6.22, when the
       analogous system call was added for PowerPC.  On architectures
       where glibc support is provided, glibc transparently wraps
       <b>sync_file_range2</b>() under the name <b>sync_file_range</b>().
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS </b>should be defined to be 64 in code that takes
       the address of <b>sync_file_range</b>, if the code is intended to be
       portable to traditional 32-bit x86 and ARM platforms where
       <b>off_t</b>'s width defaults to 32 bits.
