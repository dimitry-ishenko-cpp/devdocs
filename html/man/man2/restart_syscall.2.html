</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       restart_syscall - restart a system call after interruption by a
       stop signal
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>long restart_syscall(void);</b>

       <i>Note</i>: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>restart_syscall</b>() system call is used to restart certain
       system calls after a process that was stopped by a signal (e.g.,
       <b>SIGSTOP </b>or <b>SIGTSTP</b>) is later resumed after receiving a <b>SIGCONT</b>
       signal.  This system call is designed only for internal use by
       the kernel.

       <b>restart_syscall</b>() is used for restarting only those system calls
       that, when restarted, should adjust their time-related
       parameters—namely <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> (since Linux 2.6.24), <a href="nanosleep.2.html">nanosleep(2)</a>
       (since Linux 2.6), <a href="clock_nanosleep.2.html">clock_nanosleep(2)</a> (since Linux 2.6), and
       <a href="futex.2.html">futex(2)</a>, when employed with the <b>FUTEX_WAIT </b>(since Linux 2.6.22)
       and <b>FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET </b>(since Linux 2.6.31) operations.
       <b>restart_syscall</b>() restarts the interrupted system call with a
       time argument that is suitably adjusted to account for the time
       that has already elapsed (including the time where the process
       was stopped by a signal).  Without the <b>restart_syscall</b>()
       mechanism, restarting these system calls would not correctly
       deduct the already elapsed time when the process continued
       execution.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The return value of <b>restart_syscall</b>() is the return value of
       whatever system call is being restarted.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set as per the errors for whatever system call is being
       restarted by <b>restart_syscall</b>().
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux 2.6.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       There is no glibc wrapper for this system call, because it is
       intended for use only by the kernel and should never be called by
       applications.

       The kernel uses <b>restart_syscall</b>() to ensure that when a system
       call is restarted after a process has been stopped by a signal
       and then resumed by <b>SIGCONT</b>, then the time that the process spent
       in the stopped state is counted against the timeout interval
       specified in the original system call.  In the case of system
       calls that take a timeout argument and automatically restart
       after a stop signal plus <b>SIGCONT</b>, but which do not have the
       <b>restart_syscall</b>() mechanism built in, then, after the process
       resumes execution, the time that the process spent in the stop
       state is <i>not</i> counted against the timeout value.  Notable examples
       of system calls that suffer this problem are <a href="ppoll.2.html">ppoll(2)</a>, <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>,
       and <a href="pselect.2.html">pselect(2)</a>.

       From user space, the operation of <b>restart_syscall</b>() is largely
       invisible: to the process that made the system call that is
       restarted, it appears as though that system call executed and
       returned in the usual fashion.
