DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mmap</b>() creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the
       calling process.  The starting address for the new mapping is
       specified in <i>addr</i>.  The <i>length</i> argument specifies the length of
       the mapping (which must be greater than 0).

       If <i>addr</i> is NULL, then the kernel chooses the (page-aligned)
       address at which to create the mapping; this is the most portable
       method of creating a new mapping.  If <i>addr</i> is not NULL, then the
       kernel takes it as a hint about where to place the mapping; on
       Linux, the kernel will pick a nearby page boundary (but always
       above or equal to the value specified by
       <i>/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr</i>) and attempt to create the mapping
       there.  If another mapping already exists there, the kernel picks
       a new address that may or may not depend on the hint.  The
       address of the new mapping is returned as the result of the call.

       The contents of a file mapping (as opposed to an anonymous
       mapping; see <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS </b>below), are initialized using <i>length</i>
       bytes starting at offset <i>offset</i> in the file (or other object)
       referred to by the file descriptor <i>fd</i>.  <i>offset</i> must be a multiple
       of the page size as returned by <i>sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE)</i>.

       After the <b>mmap</b>() call has returned, the file descriptor, <i>fd</i>, can
       be closed immediately without invalidating the mapping.

       The <i>prot</i> argument describes the desired memory protection of the
       mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode of the file).
       It is either <b>PROT_NONE </b>or the bitwise OR of one or more of the
       following flags:

       <b>PROT_EXEC</b>
              Pages may be executed.

       <b>PROT_READ</b>
              Pages may be read.

       <b>PROT_WRITE</b>
              Pages may be written.

       <b>PROT_NONE</b>
              Pages may not be accessed.

   <b>The flags argument</b>
       The <i>flags</i> argument determines whether updates to the mapping are
       visible to other processes mapping the same region, and whether
       updates are carried through to the underlying file.  This
       behavior is determined by including exactly one of the following
       values in <i>flags</i>:

       <b>MAP_SHARED</b>
              Share this mapping.  Updates to the mapping are visible to
              other processes mapping the same region, and (in the case
              of file-backed mappings) are carried through to the
              underlying file.  (To precisely control when updates are
              carried through to the underlying file requires the use of
              <a href="msync.2.html">msync(2)</a>.)

       <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE </b>(since Linux 4.15)
              This flag provides the same behavior as <b>MAP_SHARED </b>except
              that <b>MAP_SHARED </b>mappings ignore unknown flags in <i>flags</i>.
              By contrast, when creating a mapping using
              <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b>, the kernel verifies all passed flags
              are known and fails the mapping with the error <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              for unknown flags.  This mapping type is also required to
              be able to use some mapping flags (e.g., <b>MAP_SYNC</b>).

       <b>MAP_PRIVATE</b>
              Create a private copy-on-write mapping.  Updates to the
              mapping are not visible to other processes mapping the
              same file, and are not carried through to the underlying
              file.  It is unspecified whether changes made to the file
              after the <b>mmap</b>() call are visible in the mapped region.

       Both <b>MAP_SHARED </b>and <b>MAP_PRIVATE </b>are described in POSIX.1-2001 and
       POSIX.1-2008.  <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE </b>is a Linux extension.

       In addition, zero or more of the following values can be ORed in
       <i>flags</i>:

       <b>MAP_32BIT </b>(since Linux 2.4.20, 2.6)
              Put the mapping into the first 2 Gigabytes of the process
              address space.  This flag is supported only on x86-64, for
              64-bit programs.  It was added to allow thread stacks to
              be allocated somewhere in the first 2 GB of memory, so as
              to improve context-switch performance on some early 64-bit
              processors.  Modern x86-64 processors no longer have this
              performance problem, so use of this flag is not required
              on those systems.  The <b>MAP_32BIT </b>flag is ignored when
              <b>MAP_FIXED </b>is set.

       <b>MAP_ANON</b>
              Synonym for <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>; provided for compatibility with
              other implementations.

       <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>
              The mapping is not backed by any file; its contents are
              initialized to zero.  The <i>fd</i> argument is ignored; however,
              some implementations require <i>fd</i> to be -1 if <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>
              (or <b>MAP_ANON</b>) is specified, and portable applications
              should ensure this.  The <i>offset</i> argument should be zero.
              Support for <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS </b>in conjunction with <b>MAP_SHARED</b>
              was added in Linux 2.4.

       <b>MAP_DENYWRITE</b>
              This flag is ignored.  (Long ago—Linux 2.0 and earlier—it
              signaled that attempts to write to the underlying file
              should fail with <b>ETXTBSY</b>.  But this was a source of
              denial-of-service attacks.)

       <b>MAP_EXECUTABLE</b>
              This flag is ignored.

       <b>MAP_FILE</b>
              Compatibility flag.  Ignored.

       <b>MAP_FIXED</b>
              Don't interpret <i>addr</i> as a hint: place the mapping at
              exactly that address.  <i>addr</i> must be suitably aligned: for
              most architectures a multiple of the page size is
              sufficient; however, some architectures may impose
              additional restrictions.  If the memory region specified
              by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i> overlaps pages of any existing
              mapping(s), then the overlapped part of the existing
              mapping(s) will be discarded.  If the specified address
              cannot be used, <b>mmap</b>() will fail.

              Software that aspires to be portable should use the
              <b>MAP_FIXED </b>flag with care, keeping in mind that the exact
              layout of a process's memory mappings is allowed to change
              significantly between Linux versions, C library versions,
              and operating system releases.  <i>Carefully read the</i>
              <i>discussion of this flag in NOTES!</i>

       <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE </b>(since Linux 4.17)
              This flag provides behavior that is similar to <b>MAP_FIXED</b>
              with respect to the <i>addr</i> enforcement, but differs in that
              <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE </b>never clobbers a preexisting mapped
              range.  If the requested range would collide with an
              existing mapping, then this call fails with the error
              <b>EEXIST.  </b>This flag can therefore be used as a way to
              atomically (with respect to other threads) attempt to map
              an address range: one thread will succeed; all others will
              report failure.

              Note that older kernels which do not recognize the
              <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE </b>flag will typically (upon detecting a
              collision with a preexisting mapping) fall back to a “non-
              <b>MAP_FIXED</b>” type of behavior: they will return an address
              that is different from the requested address.  Therefore,
              backward-compatible software should check the returned
              address against the requested address.

       <b>MAP_GROWSDOWN</b>
              This flag is used for stacks.  It indicates to the kernel
              virtual memory system that the mapping should extend
              downward in memory.  The return address is one page lower
              than the memory area that is actually created in the
              process's virtual address space.  Touching an address in
              the "guard" page below the mapping will cause the mapping
              to grow by a page.  This growth can be repeated until the
              mapping grows to within a page of the high end of the next
              lower mapping, at which point touching the "guard" page
              will result in a <b>SIGSEGV </b>signal.

       <b>MAP_HUGETLB </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Allocate the mapping using "huge" pages.  See the Linux
              kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.rst</i> for further
              information, as well as NOTES, below.

       <b>MAP_HUGE_2MB</b>
       <b>MAP_HUGE_1GB </b>(since Linux 3.8)
              Used in conjunction with <b>MAP_HUGETLB </b>to select alternative
              hugetlb page sizes (respectively, 2 MB and 1 GB) on
              systems that support multiple hugetlb page sizes.

              More generally, the desired huge page size can be
              configured by encoding the base-2 logarithm of the desired
              page size in the six bits at the offset <b>MAP_HUGE_SHIFT</b>.
              (A value of zero in this bit field provides the default
              huge page size; the default huge page size can be
              discovered via the <i>Hugepagesize</i> field exposed by
              <i>/proc/meminfo</i>.)  Thus, the above two constants are defined
              as:

                  #define MAP_HUGE_2MB    (21 &lt;&lt; MAP_HUGE_SHIFT)
                  #define MAP_HUGE_1GB    (30 &lt;&lt; MAP_HUGE_SHIFT)

              The range of huge page sizes that are supported by the
              system can be discovered by listing the subdirectories in
              <i>/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages</i>.

       <b>MAP_LOCKED </b>(since Linux 2.5.37)
              Mark the mapped region to be locked in the same way as
              <a href="mlock.2.html">mlock(2)</a>.  This implementation will try to populate
              (prefault) the whole range but the <b>mmap</b>() call doesn't
              fail with <b>ENOMEM </b>if this fails.  Therefore major faults
              might happen later on.  So the semantic is not as strong
              as <a href="mlock.2.html">mlock(2)</a>.  One should use <b>mmap</b>() plus <a href="mlock.2.html">mlock(2)</a> when
              major faults are not acceptable after the initialization
              of the mapping.  The <b>MAP_LOCKED </b>flag is ignored in older
              kernels.

       <b>MAP_NONBLOCK </b>(since Linux 2.5.46)
              This flag is meaningful only in conjunction with
              <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>.  Don't perform read-ahead: create page
              tables entries only for pages that are already present in
              RAM.  Since Linux 2.6.23, this flag causes <b>MAP_POPULATE </b>to
              do nothing.  One day, the combination of <b>MAP_POPULATE </b>and
              <b>MAP_NONBLOCK </b>may be reimplemented.

       <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>
              Do not reserve swap space for this mapping.  When swap
              space is reserved, one has the guarantee that it is
              possible to modify the mapping.  When swap space is not
              reserved one might get <b>SIGSEGV </b>upon a write if no physical
              memory is available.  See also the discussion of the file
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.  Before Linux
              2.6, this flag had effect only for private writable
              mappings.

       <b>MAP_POPULATE </b>(since Linux 2.5.46)
              Populate (prefault) page tables for a mapping.  For a file
              mapping, this causes read-ahead on the file.  This will
              help to reduce blocking on page faults later.  The <b>mmap</b>()
              call doesn't fail if the mapping cannot be populated (for
              example, due to limitations on the number of mapped huge
              pages when using <b>MAP_HUGETLB</b>).  Support for <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>
              in conjunction with private mappings was added in Linux
              2.6.23.

       <b>MAP_STACK </b>(since Linux 2.6.27)
              Allocate the mapping at an address suitable for a process
              or thread stack.

              This flag is currently a no-op on Linux.  However, by
              employing this flag, applications can ensure that they
              transparently obtain support if the flag is implemented in
              the future.  Thus, it is used in the glibc threading
              implementation to allow for the fact that some
              architectures may (later) require special treatment for
              stack allocations.  A further reason to employ this flag
              is portability: <b>MAP_STACK </b>exists (and has an effect) on
              some other systems (e.g., some of the BSDs).

       <b>MAP_SYNC </b>(since Linux 4.15)
              This flag is available only with the <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b>
              mapping type; mappings of type <b>MAP_SHARED </b>will silently
              ignore this flag.  This flag is supported only for files
              supporting DAX (direct mapping of persistent memory).  For
              other files, creating a mapping with this flag results in
              an <b>EOPNOTSUPP </b>error.

              Shared file mappings with this flag provide the guarantee
              that while some memory is mapped writable in the address
              space of the process, it will be visible in the same file
              at the same offset even after the system crashes or is
              rebooted.  In conjunction with the use of appropriate CPU
              instructions, this provides users of such mappings with a
              more efficient way of making data modifications
              persistent.

       <b>MAP_UNINITIALIZED </b>(since Linux 2.6.33)
              Don't clear anonymous pages.  This flag is intended to
              improve performance on embedded devices.  This flag is
              honored only if the kernel was configured with the
              <b>CONFIG_MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED </b>option.  Because of the
              security implications, that option is normally enabled
              only on embedded devices (i.e., devices where one has
              complete control of the contents of user memory).

       Of the above flags, only <b>MAP_FIXED </b>is specified in POSIX.1-2001
       and POSIX.1-2008.  However, most systems also support
       <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS </b>(or its synonym <b>MAP_ANON</b>).

   <b>munmap()</b>
       The <b>munmap</b>() system call deletes the mappings for the specified
       address range, and causes further references to addresses within
       the range to generate invalid memory references.  The region is
       also automatically unmapped when the process is terminated.  On
       the other hand, closing the file descriptor does not unmap the
       region.

       The address <i>addr</i> must be a multiple of the page size (but <i>length</i>
       need not be).  All pages containing a part of the indicated range
       are unmapped, and subsequent references to these pages will
       generate <b>SIGSEGV</b>.  It is not an error if the indicated range does
       not contain any mapped pages.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>mmap</b>() returns a pointer to the mapped area.  On
       error, the value <b>MAP_FAILED </b>(that is, <i>(void *) -1</i>) is returned,
       and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.

       On success, <b>munmap</b>() returns 0.  On failure, it returns -1, and
       <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error (probably to <b>EINVAL</b>).
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EACCES </b>A file descriptor refers to a non-regular file.  Or a file
              mapping was requested, but <i>fd</i> is not open for reading.  Or
              <b>MAP_SHARED </b>was requested and <b>PROT_WRITE </b>is set, but <i>fd</i> is
              not open in read/write (<b>O_RDWR</b>) mode.  Or <b>PROT_WRITE </b>is
              set, but the file is append-only.

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The file has been locked, or too much memory has been
              locked (see <a href="setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit(2)</a>).

       <b>EBADF  </b><i>fd</i> is not a valid file descriptor (and <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS </b>was
              not set).

       <b>EEXIST MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE </b>was specified in <i>flags</i>, and the range
              covered by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i> clashes with an existing
              mapping.

       <b>EINVAL </b>We don't like <i>addr</i>, <i>length</i>, or <i>offset</i> (e.g., they are too
              large, or not aligned on a page boundary).

       <b>EINVAL </b>(since Linux 2.6.12) <i>length</i> was 0.

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>flags</i> contained none of <b>MAP_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MAP_SHARED</b>, or
              <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b>.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
              has been reached.

       <b>ENODEV </b>The underlying filesystem of the specified file does not
              support memory mapping.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>No memory is available.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The process's maximum number of mappings would have been
              exceeded.  This error can also occur for <b>munmap</b>(), when
              unmapping a region in the middle of an existing mapping,
              since this results in two smaller mappings on either side
              of the region being unmapped.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>(since Linux 4.7) The process's <b>RLIMIT_DATA </b>limit,
              described in <a href="getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit(2)</a>, would have been exceeded.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>We don't like <i>addr</i>, because it exceeds the virtual address
              space of the CPU.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              On 32-bit architecture together with the large file
              extension (i.e., using 64-bit <i>off_t</i>): the number of pages
              used for <i>length</i> plus number of pages used for <i>offset</i> would
              overflow <i>unsigned long</i> (32 bits).

       <b>EPERM  </b>The <i>prot</i> argument asks for <b>PROT_EXEC </b>but the mapped area
              belongs to a file on a filesystem that was mounted no-
              exec.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The operation was prevented by a file seal; see <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       On some hardware architectures (e.g., i386), <b>PROT_WRITE </b>implies
       <b>PROT_READ</b>.  It is architecture dependent whether <b>PROT_READ</b>
       implies <b>PROT_EXEC </b>or not.  Portable programs should always set
       <b>PROT_EXEC </b>if they intend to execute code in the new mapping.

       The portable way to create a mapping is to specify <i>addr</i> as 0
       (NULL), and omit <b>MAP_FIXED </b>from <i>flags</i>.  In this case, the system
       chooses the address for the mapping; the address is chosen so as
       not to conflict with any existing mapping, and will not be 0.  If
       the <b>MAP_FIXED </b>flag is specified, and <i>addr</i> is 0 (NULL), then the
       mapped address will be 0 (NULL).

       Certain <i>flags</i> constants are defined only if suitable feature test
       macros are defined (possibly by default): <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE </b>with
       glibc 2.19 or later; or <b>_BSD_SOURCE </b>or <b>_SVID_SOURCE </b>in glibc 2.19
       and earlier.  (Employing <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>also suffices, and requiring
       that macro specifically would have been more logical, since these
       flags are all Linux-specific.)  The relevant flags are:
       <b>MAP_32BIT</b>, <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS </b>(and the synonym <b>MAP_ANON</b>),
       <b>MAP_DENYWRITE</b>, <b>MAP_EXECUTABLE</b>, <b>MAP_FILE</b>, <b>MAP_GROWSDOWN</b>,
       <b>MAP_HUGETLB</b>, <b>MAP_LOCKED</b>, <b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b>, <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>,
       <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>, and <b>MAP_STACK</b>.

   <b>C library/kernel differences</b>
       This page describes the interface provided by the glibc <b>mmap</b>()
       wrapper function.  Originally, this function invoked a system
       call of the same name.  Since Linux 2.4, that system call has
       been superseded by <a href="mmap2.2.html">mmap2(2)</a>, and nowadays the glibc <b>mmap</b>()
       wrapper function invokes <a href="mmap2.2.html">mmap2(2)</a> with a suitably adjusted value
       for <i>offset</i>.

STANDARDS </h2>

       POSIX.1-2008.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.4BSD.

       On POSIX systems on which <b>mmap</b>(), <a href="msync.2.html">msync(2)</a>, and <b>munmap</b>() are
       available, <b>_POSIX_MAPPED_FILES </b>is defined in <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i> to a
       value greater than 0.  (See also <a href="../man3/sysconf.3.html">sysconf(3)</a>.)
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Memory mapped by <b>mmap</b>() is preserved across <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, with the
       same attributes.

       A file is mapped in multiples of the page size.  For a file that
       is not a multiple of the page size, the remaining bytes in the
       partial page at the end of the mapping are zeroed when mapped,
       and modifications to that region are not written out to the file.
       The effect of changing the size of the underlying file of a
       mapping on the pages that correspond to added or removed regions
       of the file is unspecified.

       An application can determine which pages of a mapping are
       currently resident in the buffer/page cache using <a href="mincore.2.html">mincore(2)</a>.

   <b>Using MAP_FIXED safely</b>
       The only safe use for <b>MAP_FIXED </b>is where the address range
       specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i> was previously reserved using
       another mapping; otherwise, the use of <b>MAP_FIXED </b>is hazardous
       because it forcibly removes preexisting mappings, making it easy
       for a multithreaded process to corrupt its own address space.

       For example, suppose that thread A looks through <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/maps</i>
       in order to locate an unused address range that it can map using
       <b>MAP_FIXED</b>, while thread B simultaneously acquires part or all of
       that same address range.  When thread A subsequently employs
       <b>mmap(MAP_FIXED)</b>, it will effectively clobber the mapping that
       thread B created.  In this scenario, thread B need not create a
       mapping directly; simply making a library call that, internally,
       uses <a href="../man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen(3)</a> to load some other shared library, will suffice.
       The <a href="../man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen(3)</a> call will map the library into the process's
       address space.  Furthermore, almost any library call may be
       implemented in a way that adds memory mappings to the address
       space, either with this technique, or by simply allocating
       memory.  Examples include <a href="brk.2.html">brk(2)</a>, <a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a>, <a href="../man3/pthread_create.3.html">pthread_create(3)</a>,
       and the PAM libraries ⟨<a href="http://www.linux-pam.org">http://www.linux-pam.org</a>⟩.

       Since Linux 4.17, a multithreaded program can use the
       <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE </b>flag to avoid the hazard described above when
       attempting to create a mapping at a fixed address that has not
       been reserved by a preexisting mapping.

   <b>Timestamps changes for file-backed mappings</b>
       For file-backed mappings, the <i>st_atime</i> field for the mapped file
       may be updated at any time between the <b>mmap</b>() and the
       corresponding unmapping; the first reference to a mapped page
       will update the field if it has not been already.

       The <i>st_ctime</i> and <i>st_mtime</i> field for a file mapped with <b>PROT_WRITE</b>
       and <b>MAP_SHARED </b>will be updated after a write to the mapped
       region, and before a subsequent <a href="msync.2.html">msync(2)</a> with the <b>MS_SYNC </b>or
       <b>MS_ASYNC </b>flag, if one occurs.

   <b>Huge page (Huge TLB) mappings</b>
       For mappings that employ huge pages, the requirements for the
       arguments of <b>mmap</b>() and <b>munmap</b>() differ somewhat from the
       requirements for mappings that use the native system page size.

       For <b>mmap</b>(), <i>offset</i> must be a multiple of the underlying huge page
       size.  The system automatically aligns <i>length</i> to be a multiple of
       the underlying huge page size.

       For <b>munmap</b>(), <i>addr</i>, and <i>length</i> must both be a multiple of the
       underlying huge page size.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       On Linux, there are no guarantees like those suggested above
       under <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>.  By default, any process can be killed at
       any moment when the system runs out of memory.

       Before Linux 2.6.7, the <b>MAP_POPULATE </b>flag has effect only if <i>prot</i>
       is specified as <b>PROT_NONE</b>.

       SUSv3 specifies that <b>mmap</b>() should fail if <i>length</i> is 0.  However,
       before Linux 2.6.12, <b>mmap</b>() succeeded in this case: no mapping
       was created and the call returned <i>addr</i>.  Since Linux 2.6.12,
       <b>mmap</b>() fails with the error <b>EINVAL </b>for this case.

       POSIX specifies that the system shall always zero fill any
       partial page at the end of the object and that system will never
       write any modification of the object beyond its end.  On Linux,
       when you write data to such partial page after the end of the
       object, the data stays in the page cache even after the file is
       closed and unmapped and even though the data is never written to
       the file itself, subsequent mappings may see the modified
       content.  In some cases, this could be fixed by calling <a href="msync.2.html">msync(2)</a>
       before the unmap takes place; however, this doesn't work on
       <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a> (for example, when using the POSIX shared memory
       interface documented in <a href="../man7/shm_overview.7.html">shm_overview(7)</a>).

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following program prints part of the file specified in its
       first command-line argument to standard output.  The range of
       bytes to be printed is specified via offset and length values in
       the second and third command-line arguments.  The program creates
       a memory mapping of the required pages of the file and then uses
       <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> to output the desired bytes.
