SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int execve(const char *</b><i>pathname</i><b>, char *const _Nullable </b><i>argv</i><b>[],</b>
                  <b>char *const _Nullable </b><i>envp</i><b>[]);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>execve</b>() executes the program referred to by <i>pathname</i>.  This
       causes the program that is currently being run by the calling
       process to be replaced with a new program, with newly initialized
       stack, heap, and (initialized and uninitialized) data segments.

       <i>pathname</i> must be either a binary executable, or a script starting
       with a line of the form:

           <b>#!</b><i>interpreter</i> [optional-arg]

       For details of the latter case, see "Interpreter scripts" below.

       <i>argv</i> is an array of pointers to strings passed to the new program
       as its command-line arguments.  By convention, the first of these
       strings (i.e., <i>argv[0]</i>) should contain the filename associated
       with the file being executed.  The <i>argv</i> array must be terminated
       by a null pointer.  (Thus, in the new program, <i>argv[argc]</i> will be
       a null pointer.)

       <i>envp</i> is an array of pointers to strings, conventionally of the
       form <b>key=value</b>, which are passed as the environment of the new
       program.  The <i>envp</i> array must be terminated by a null pointer.

       This manual page describes the Linux system call in detail; for
       an overview of the nomenclature and the many, often preferable,
       standardised variants of this function provided by libc,
       including ones that search the <b>PATH </b>environment variable, see
       <a href="../man3/exec.3.html">exec(3)</a>.

       The argument vector and environment can be accessed by the new
       program's main function, when it is defined as:

           int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])

       Note, however, that the use of a third argument to the main
       function is not specified in POSIX.1; according to POSIX.1, the
       environment should be accessed via the external variable
       <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.

       <b>execve</b>() does not return on success, and the text, initialized
       data, uninitialized data (bss), and stack of the calling process
       are overwritten according to the contents of the newly loaded
       program.

       If the current program is being ptraced, a <b>SIGTRAP </b>signal is sent
       to it after a successful <b>execve</b>().

       If the set-user-ID bit is set on the program file referred to by
       <i>pathname</i>, then the effective user ID of the calling process is
       changed to that of the owner of the program file.  Similarly, if
       the set-group-ID bit is set on the program file, then the
       effective group ID of the calling process is set to the group of
       the program file.

       The aforementioned transformations of the effective IDs are <i>not</i>
       performed (i.e., the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are
       ignored) if any of the following is true:

       •  the <i>no_new_privs</i> attribute is set for the calling thread (see
          <a href="prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>);

       •  the underlying filesystem is mounted <i>nosuid</i> (the <b>MS_NOSUID</b>
          flag for <a href="mount.2.html">mount(2)</a>); or

       •  the calling process is being ptraced.

       The capabilities of the program file (see <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>) are
       also ignored if any of the above are true.

       The effective user ID of the process is copied to the saved set-
       user-ID; similarly, the effective group ID is copied to the saved
       set-group-ID.  This copying takes place after any effective ID
       changes that occur because of the set-user-ID and set-group-ID
       mode bits.

       The process's real UID and real GID, as well as its supplementary
       group IDs, are unchanged by a call to <b>execve</b>().

       If the executable is an a.out dynamically linked binary
       executable containing shared-library stubs, the Linux dynamic
       linker <a href="../man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so(8)</a> is called at the start of execution to bring
       needed shared objects into memory and link the executable with
       them.

       If the executable is a dynamically linked ELF executable, the
       interpreter named in the PT_INTERP segment is used to load the
       needed shared objects.  This interpreter is typically
       <i>/lib/ld-linux.so.2</i> for binaries linked with glibc (see
       <a href="../man8/ld-linux.so.8.html">ld-linux.so(8)</a>).

   <b>Effect on process attributes</b>
       All process attributes are preserved during an <b>execve</b>(), except
       the following:

       •  The dispositions of any signals that are being caught are
          reset to the default (<a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal(7)</a>).

       •  Any alternate signal stack is not preserved (<a href="sigaltstack.2.html">sigaltstack(2)</a>).

       •  Memory mappings are not preserved (<a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).

       •  Attached System V shared memory segments are detached
          (<a href="shmat.2.html">shmat(2)</a>).

       •  POSIX shared memory regions are unmapped (<a href="../man3/shm_open.3.html">shm_open(3)</a>).

       •  Open POSIX message queue descriptors are closed
          (<a href="../man7/mq_overview.7.html">mq_overview(7)</a>).

       •  Any open POSIX named semaphores are closed (<a href="../man7/sem_overview.7.html">sem_overview(7)</a>).

       •  POSIX timers are not preserved (<a href="timer_create.2.html">timer_create(2)</a>).

       •  Any open directory streams are closed (<a href="../man3/opendir.3.html">opendir(3)</a>).

       •  Memory locks are not preserved (<a href="mlock.2.html">mlock(2)</a>, <a href="mlockall.2.html">mlockall(2)</a>).

       •  Exit handlers are not preserved (<a href="../man3/atexit.3.html">atexit(3)</a>, <a href="../man3/on_exit.3.html">on_exit(3)</a>).

       •  The floating-point environment is reset to the default (see
          <a href="../man3/fenv.3.html">fenv(3)</a>).

       The process attributes in the preceding list are all specified in
       POSIX.1.  The following Linux-specific process attributes are
       also not preserved during an <b>execve</b>():

       •  The process's "dumpable" attribute is set to the value 1,
          unless a set-user-ID program, a set-group-ID program, or a
          program with capabilities is being executed, in which case the
          dumpable flag may instead be reset to the value in
          <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i>, in the circumstances described
          under <b>PR_SET_DUMPABLE </b>in <a href="prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>.  Note that changes to the
          "dumpable" attribute may cause ownership of files in the
          process's <i>/proc/</i>pid directory to change to <i>root:root</i>, as
          described in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       •  The <a href="prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS </b>flag is cleared.

       •  (Since Linux 2.4.36 / 2.6.23) If a set-user-ID or set-group-ID
          program is being executed, then the parent death signal set by
          <a href="prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG </b>flag is cleared.

       •  The process name, as set by <a href="prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_NAME </b>(and
          displayed by <i>ps -o comm</i>), is reset to the name of the new
          executable file.

       •  The <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS </b><i>securebits</i> flag is cleared.  See
          <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.

       •  The termination signal is reset to <b>SIGCHLD </b>(see <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>).

       •  The file descriptor table is unshared, undoing the effect of
          the <b>CLONE_FILES </b>flag of <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>.

       Note the following further points:

       •  All threads other than the calling thread are destroyed during
          an <b>execve</b>().  Mutexes, condition variables, and other pthreads
          objects are not preserved.

       •  The equivalent of <i>setlocale(LC_ALL, "C")</i> is executed at
          program start-up.

       •  POSIX.1 specifies that the dispositions of any signals that
          are ignored or set to the default are left unchanged.  POSIX.1
          specifies one exception: if <b>SIGCHLD </b>is being ignored, then an
          implementation may leave the disposition unchanged or reset it
          to the default; Linux does the former.

       •  Any outstanding asynchronous I/O operations are canceled
          (<a href="../man3/aio_read.3.html">aio_read(3)</a>, <a href="../man3/aio_write.3.html">aio_write(3)</a>).

       •  For the handling of capabilities during <b>execve</b>(), see
          <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.

       •  By default, file descriptors remain open across an <b>execve</b>().
          File descriptors that are marked close-on-exec are closed; see
          the description of <b>FD_CLOEXEC </b>in <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.  (If a file
          descriptor is closed, this will cause the release of all
          record locks obtained on the underlying file by this process.
          See <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> for details.)  POSIX.1 says that if file
          descriptors 0, 1, and 2 would otherwise be closed after a
          successful <b>execve</b>(), and the process would gain privilege
          because the set-user-ID or set-group-ID mode bit was set on
          the executed file, then the system may open an unspecified
          file for each of these file descriptors.  As a general
          principle, no portable program, whether privileged or not, can
          assume that these three file descriptors will remain closed
          across an <b>execve</b>().

   <b>Interpreter scripts</b>
       An interpreter script is a text file that has execute permission
       enabled and whose first line is of the form:

           <b>#!</b><i>interpreter</i> [optional-arg]

       The <i>interpreter</i> must be a valid pathname for an executable file.

       If the <i>pathname</i> argument of <b>execve</b>() specifies an interpreter
       script, then <i>interpreter</i> will be invoked with the following
       arguments:

           <i>interpreter</i> [optional-arg] <i>pathname</i> arg...

       where <i>pathname</i> is the pathname of the file specified as the first
       argument of <b>execve</b>(), and <i>arg...</i>  is the series of words pointed
       to by the <i>argv</i> argument of <b>execve</b>(), starting at <i>argv[1]</i>.  Note
       that there is no way to get the <i>argv[0]</i> that was passed to the
       <b>execve</b>() call.

       For portable use, <i>optional-arg</i> should either be absent, or be
       specified as a single word (i.e., it should not contain white
       space); see NOTES below.

       Since Linux 2.6.28, the kernel permits the interpreter of a
       script to itself be a script.  This permission is recursive, up
       to a limit of four recursions, so that the interpreter may be a
       script which is interpreted by a script, and so on.

   <b>Limits on size of arguments and environment</b>
       Most UNIX implementations impose some limit on the total size of
       the command-line argument (<i>argv</i>) and environment (<i>envp</i>) strings
       that may be passed to a new program.  POSIX.1 allows an
       implementation to advertise this limit using the <b>ARG_MAX </b>constant
       (either defined in <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> or available at run time using the
       call <i>sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)</i>).

       Before Linux 2.6.23, the memory used to store the environment and
       argument strings was limited to 32 pages (defined by the kernel
       constant <b>MAX_ARG_PAGES</b>).  On architectures with a 4-kB page size,
       this yields a maximum size of 128 kB.

       On Linux 2.6.23 and later, most architectures support a size
       limit derived from the soft <b>RLIMIT_STACK </b>resource limit (see
       <a href="getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit(2)</a>) that is in force at the time of the <b>execve</b>() call.
       (Architectures with no memory management unit are excepted: they
       maintain the limit that was in effect before Linux 2.6.23.)  This
       change allows programs to have a much larger argument and/or
       environment list.  For these architectures, the total size is
       limited to 1/4 of the allowed stack size.  (Imposing the
       1/4-limit ensures that the new program always has some stack
       space.)  Additionally, the total size is limited to 3/4 of the
       value of the kernel constant <b>_STK_LIM </b>(8 MiB).  Since Linux
       2.6.25, the kernel also places a floor of 32 pages on this size
       limit, so that, even when <b>RLIMIT_STACK </b>is set very low,
       applications are guaranteed to have at least as much argument and
       environment space as was provided by Linux 2.6.22 and earlier.
       (This guarantee was not provided in Linux 2.6.23 and 2.6.24.)
       Additionally, the limit per string is 32 pages (the kernel
       constant <b>MAX_ARG_STRLEN</b>), and the maximum number of strings is
       0x7FFFFFFF.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>execve</b>() does not return, on error -1 is returned,

</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX does not document the #! behavior, but it exists (with some
       variations) on other UNIX systems.

       On Linux, <i>argv</i> and <i>envp</i> can be specified as NULL.  In both cases,
       this has the same effect as specifying the argument as a pointer
       to a list containing a single null pointer.  <b>Do not take</b>
       <b>advantage of this nonstandard and nonportable misfeature!  </b>On
       many other UNIX systems, specifying <i>argv</i> as NULL will result in
       an error (<b>EFAULT</b>).  <i>Some</i> other UNIX systems treat the <i>envp==NULL</i>
       case the same as Linux.

       POSIX.1 says that values returned by <a href="../man3/sysconf.3.html">sysconf(3)</a> should be
       invariant over the lifetime of a process.  However, since Linux
       2.6.23, if the <b>RLIMIT_STACK </b>resource limit changes, then the
       value reported by <b>_SC_ARG_MAX </b>will also change, to reflect the
       fact that the limit on space for holding command-line arguments
       and environment variables has changed.

   <b>Interpreter scripts</b>
       The kernel imposes a maximum length on the text that follows the
       "#!" characters at the start of a script; characters beyond the
       limit are ignored.  Before Linux 5.1, the limit is 127
       characters.  Since Linux 5.1, the limit is 255 characters.

       The semantics of the <i>optional-arg</i> argument of an interpreter
       script vary across implementations.  On Linux, the entire string
       following the <i>interpreter</i> name is passed as a single argument to
       the interpreter, and this string can include white space.
       However, behavior differs on some other systems.  Some systems
       use the first white space to terminate <i>optional-arg</i>.  On some
       systems, an interpreter script can have multiple arguments, and
       white spaces in <i>optional-arg</i> are used to delimit the arguments.

       Linux (like most other modern UNIX systems) ignores the set-user-
       ID and set-group-ID bits on scripts.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

       With UNIX V6, the argument list of an <b>exec</b>() call was ended by 0,
       while the argument list of <i>main</i> was ended by -1.  Thus, this
       argument list was not directly usable in a further <b>exec</b>() call.
       Since UNIX V7, both are NULL.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       One sometimes sees <b>execve</b>() (and the related functions described
       in <a href="../man3/exec.3.html">exec(3)</a>) described as "executing a <i>new</i> process" (or similar).
       This is a highly misleading description: there is no new process;
       many attributes of the calling process remain unchanged (in
       particular, its PID).  All that <b>execve</b>() does is arrange for an
       existing process (the calling process) to execute a new program.

       Set-user-ID and set-group-ID processes can not be <a href="ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>d.

       The result of mounting a filesystem <i>nosuid</i> varies across Linux
       kernel versions: some will refuse execution of set-user-ID and
       set-group-ID executables when this would give the user powers
       they did not have already (and return <b>EPERM</b>), some will just
       ignore the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits and <b>exec</b>()
       successfully.

       In most cases where <b>execve</b>() fails, control returns to the
       original executable image, and the caller of <b>execve</b>() can then
       handle the error.  However, in (rare) cases (typically caused by
       resource exhaustion), failure may occur past the point of no
       return: the original executable image has been torn down, but the
       new image could not be completely built.  In such cases, the
       kernel kills the process with a <b>SIGSEGV </b>(<b>SIGKILL </b>until Linux
       3.17) signal.

   <b>execve() and EAGAIN</b>
       A more detailed explanation of the <b>EAGAIN </b>error that can occur
       (since Linux 3.1) when calling <b>execve</b>() is as follows.

       The <b>EAGAIN </b>error can occur when a <i>preceding</i> call to <a href="setuid.2.html">setuid(2)</a>,
       <a href="setreuid.2.html">setreuid(2)</a>, or <a href="setresuid.2.html">setresuid(2)</a> caused the real user ID of the
       process to change, and that change caused the process to exceed
       its <b>RLIMIT_NPROC </b>resource limit (i.e., the number of processes
       belonging to the new real UID exceeds the resource limit).  From
       Linux 2.6.0 to Linux 3.0, this caused the <b>set*uid</b>() call to fail.
       (Before Linux 2.6, the resource limit was not imposed on
       processes that changed their user IDs.)

       Since Linux 3.1, the scenario just described no longer causes the
       <b>set*uid</b>() call to fail, because it too often led to security
       holes where buggy applications didn't check the return status and
       assumed that—if the caller had root privileges—the call would
       always succeed.  Instead, the <b>set*uid</b>() calls now successfully
       change the real UID, but the kernel sets an internal flag, named
       <b>PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED</b>, to note that the <b>RLIMIT_NPROC </b>resource limit
       has been exceeded.  If the <b>PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED </b>flag is set and the
       resource limit is still exceeded at the time of a subsequent
       <b>execve</b>() call, that call fails with the error <b>EAGAIN</b>.  This
       kernel logic ensures that the <b>RLIMIT_NPROC </b>resource limit is
       still enforced for the common privileged daemon workflow—namely,
       <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> + <b>set*uid</b>() + <b>execve</b>().

       If the resource limit was not still exceeded at the time of the
       <b>execve</b>() call (because other processes belonging to this real UID
       terminated between the <b>set*uid</b>() call and the <b>execve</b>() call),
       then the <b>execve</b>() call succeeds and the kernel clears the
       <b>PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED </b>process flag.  The flag is also cleared if a
       subsequent call to <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> by this process succeeds.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following program is designed to be execed by the second
       program below.  It just echoes its command-line arguments, one
       per line.

           /* myecho.c */

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

           int
           main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               for (size_t j = 0; j &lt; argc; j++)
                   printf("argv[%zu]: %s\n", j, argv[j]);

               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
           }

       This program can be used to exec the program named in its
       command-line argument:

           /* execve.c */

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

           int
           main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               static char *newargv[] = { NULL, "hello", "world", NULL };
               static char *newenviron[] = { NULL };

               if (argc != 2) {
                   fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s &lt;file-to-exec&gt;\n", argv[0]);
                   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
               }

               newargv[0] = argv[1];

               execve(argv[1], newargv, newenviron);
               perror("execve");   /* execve() returns only on error */
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

       We can use the second program to exec the first as follows:

           $ <b>cc myecho.c -o myecho</b>
           $ <b>cc execve.c -o execve</b>
           $ <b>./execve ./myecho</b>
           argv[0]: ./myecho
           argv[1]: hello
           argv[2]: world

       We can also use these programs to demonstrate the use of a script
       interpreter.  To do this we create a script whose "interpreter"
       is our <i>myecho</i> program:

           $ <b>cat &gt; script</b>
           <b>#!./myecho script-arg</b>
           <b>^D</b>
           $ <b>chmod +x script</b>

       We can then use our program to exec the script:

           $ <b>./execve ./script</b>
           argv[0]: ./myecho
           argv[1]: script-arg
           argv[2]: ./script
           argv[3]: hello
           argv[4]: world
