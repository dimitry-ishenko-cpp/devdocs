NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ioctl_xfs_fscounts - query XFS summary counter information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;xfs/xfs_fs.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int ioctl(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, XFS_IOC_FSCOUNTS, struct xfs_fsop_counts *</b><i>arg</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Query the raw filesystem summary counters.  Unlike <a href="../man3/statvfs.3.html">statvfs(3)</a>,
       the values returned here are the raw values, which do not reflect
       any alterations or limits set by project quotas.  The counter
       information is conveyed in a structure of the following form:

           struct xfs_fsop_counts {
                __u64   freedata;
                __u64   freertx;
                __u64   freeino;
                __u64   allocino;
           };

       The fields of this structure are as follows:

       <i>freedata</i> is the number of free filesystem blocks on the data
       device.

       <i>freertx</i> is the number of free extents on the realtime device.

       <i>freeino</i> is the number of inode records that are not in use within
       the space that has been allocated for them.

       <i>allocino</i> is the number of inode records for which space has been
       allocated.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       <b>EFSBADCRC</b>
              Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the
              query.

       <b>EFSCORRUPTED</b>
              Metadata corruption was encountered while performing the
              query.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The specified allocation group number is not valid for
              this filesystem.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error was encountered while performing the query.
