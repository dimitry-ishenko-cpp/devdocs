NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ioctl_xfs_fsinumbers - extract a list of valid inode numbers from
       an XFS filesystem
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;xfs/xfs_fs.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int ioctl(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, XFS_IOC_FSINUMBERS, struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq</b>
       <b>*</b><i>arg</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Queries inode allocation information from an XFS filesystem.  It
       is intended to be called iteratively to obtain the entire set of
       inodes.  These ioctls use <b>struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq </b>to set up a
       bulk transfer with the kernel:

           struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq {
                __u64   *lastip;
                __s32   count;
                void    *ubuffer;
                __s32   *ocount;
           };

       <i>lastip</i> points to a value that will receive the number of the
       "last inode."  This should be set to one less than the number of
       the first inode for which the caller wants information, or zero
       to start with the first inode in the filesystem.  After the call,
       this value will be set to the number of the last inode for which
       information is supplied.  This field will not be updated if
       <i>ocount</i> is NULL.

       <i>count</i> is the number of elements in the <b>ubuffer </b>array and
       therefore the number of inode groups for which to return
       allocation information.

       <i>ocount</i> points to a value that will receive the number of records
       returned.  An output value of zero means that there are no more
       inode groups left to enumerate.  If this value is NULL, then
       neither <i>ocount</i> nor <i>lastip</i> will be updated.

       <i>ubuffer</i> points to a memory buffer where inode group information
       will be copied.  This buffer must be an array of <b>struct</b>
       <b>xfs_inogrp </b>which is described below.  The array must have at
       least <i>count</i> elements.

           struct xfs_inogrp {
                __u64   xi_startino;
                __s32   xi_alloccount;
                __u64   xi_allocmask;
           }

       This structure describes inode usage information for a group of
       64 consecutive inode numbers.  The fields are as follows:

       <i>xi_startino</i> is the first inode number of this group.

       <i>xi_alloccount</i> is the number of bits that are set in <i>xi_allocmask</i>.
       This is the number of inodes allocated in this group.

       <i>xi_allocmask</i> is a bitmask of inodes that are allocated in this
       inode group.  The bitmask is 64 bits long, and the least
       significant bit corresponds to inode <b>xi_startino</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On error, -1 is returned, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       <b>EFAULT </b>The kernel was not able to copy into the userspace buffer.

       <b>EFSBADCRC</b>
              Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the
              query.

       <b>EFSCORRUPTED</b>
              Metadata corruption was encountered while performing the
              query.

       <b>EINVAL </b>One of the arguments was not valid.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error was encountered while performing the query.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>There was insufficient memory to perform the query.
