DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-pcrphase.service, systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service, and
       systemd-pcrphase-initrd.service are system services that measure
       specific strings into TPM2 PCR 11 during boot at various
       milestones of the boot process.

       systemd-pcrmachine.service is a system service that measures the
       machine ID (see <a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a>) into PCR 15.

       systemd-pcrfs-root.service and systemd-pcrfs@.service are
       services that measure file system identity information (i.e.
       mount point, file system type, label and UUID, partition label
       and UUID) into PCR 15.  systemd-pcrfs-root.service does so for
       the root file system, systemd-pcrfs@.service is a template unit
       that measures the file system indicated by its instance
       identifier instead.

       These services require <a href="../man7/systemd-stub.7.html">systemd-stub(7)</a> to be used in a unified
       kernel image (UKI). They execute no operation when the stub has
       not been used to invoke the kernel. The stub will measure the
       invoked kernel and associated vendor resources into PCR 11 before
       handing control to it; once userspace is invoked these services
       then will extend TPM2 PCR 11 with certain literal strings
       indicating phases of the boot process. During a regular boot
       process PCR 11 is extended with the following strings:

        1. "enter-initrd" — early when the initrd initializes, before
           activating system extension images for the initrd. It acts as
           a barrier between the time where the kernel initializes and
           where the initrd starts operating and enables system
           extension images, i.e. code shipped outside of the UKI. (This
           extension happens when the <a href="systemd-pcrphase-initrd.service.8.html">systemd-pcrphase-initrd.service(8)</a>
           service is started.)

        2. "leave-initrd" — when the initrd is about to transition into
           the host file system. It acts as barrier between initrd code
           and host OS code. (This extension happens when the
           systemd-pcrphase-initrd.service service is stopped.)

        3. "sysinit" — when basic system initialization is complete
           (which includes local file systems having been mounted), and
           the system begins starting regular system services. (This
           extension happens when the
           <a href="systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service.8.html">systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service(8)</a> service is started.)

        4. "ready" — during later boot-up, after remote file systems
           have been activated (i.e. after remote-fs.target), but before
           users are permitted to log in (i.e. before
           systemd-user-sessions.service). It acts as barrier between
           the time where unprivileged regular users are still
           prohibited to log in and where they are allowed to log in.
           (This extension happens when the systemd-pcrphase.service
           service is started.)

        5. "shutdown" — when the system shutdown begins. It acts as
           barrier between the time the system is fully up and running
           and where it is about to shut down. (This extension happens
           when the systemd-pcrphase.service service is stopped.)

        6. "final" — at the end of system shutdown. It acts as barrier
           between the time the service manager still runs and when it
           transitions into the final shutdown phase where service
           management is not available anymore. (This extension happens
           when the <a href="systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service.8.html">systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service(8)</a> service is
           stopped.)

       During a regular system lifecycle, PCR 11 is extended with the
       strings "enter-initrd", "leave-initrd", "sysinit", "ready",
       "shutdown", and "final".

       Specific phases of the boot process may be referenced via the
       series of strings measured, separated by colons (the "phase
       path"). For example, the phase path for the regular system
       runtime is "enter-initrd:leave-initrd:sysinit:ready", while the
       one for the initrd is just "enter-initrd". The phase path for the
       boot phase before the initrd is an empty string; because that's
       hard to pass around a single colon (":") may be used instead.
       Note that the aforementioned six strings are just the default
       strings and individual systems might measure other strings at
       other times, and thus implement different and more fine-grained
       boot phases to bind policy to.

       By binding policy of TPM2 objects to a specific phase path it is
       possible to restrict access to them to specific phases of the
       boot process, for example making it impossible to access the root
       file system's encryption key after the system transitioned from
       the initrd into the host root file system.

       Use <a href="../man1/systemd-measure.1.html">systemd-measure(1)</a> to pre-calculate expected PCR 11 values
       for specific boot phases (via the <b>--phase= </b>switch).

       systemd-pcrfs-root.service and systemd-pcrfs@.service are
       automatically pulled into the initial transaction by
       <a href="systemd-gpt-auto-generator.8.html">systemd-gpt-auto-generator(8)</a> for the root and /var/ file
       systems.  <a href="systemd-fstab-generator.8.html">systemd-fstab-generator(8)</a> will do this for all mounts
       with the <b>x-systemd.pcrfs </b>mount option in /etc/fstab.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The /usr/lib/systemd/system-pcrextend executable may also be
       invoked from the command line, where it expects the word to
       extend into PCR 11, as well as the following switches:

       <b>--bank=</b>
           Takes the PCR banks to extend the specified word into. If not
           specified the tool automatically determines all enabled PCR
           banks and measures the word into all of them.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--pcr=</b>
           Takes the index of the PCR to extend. If <b>--machine-id </b>or
           <b>--file-system= </b>are specified defaults to 15, otherwise
           defaults to 11.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--tpm2-device=</b><i>PATH</i>
           Controls which TPM2 device to use. Expects a device node path
           referring to the TPM2 chip (e.g.  /dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively
           the special value "auto" may be specified, in order to
           automatically determine the device node of a suitable TPM2
           device (of which there must be exactly one). The special
           value "list" may be used to enumerate all suitable TPM2
           devices currently discovered.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--graceful</b>
           If no TPM2 firmware, kernel subsystem, kernel driver or
           device support is found, exit with exit status 0 (i.e.
           indicate success). If this is not specified any attempt to
           measure without a TPM2 device will cause the invocation to
           fail.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--machine-id</b>
           Instead of measuring a word specified on the command line
           into PCR 11, measure the host's machine ID into PCR 15.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--file-system=</b>
           Instead of measuring a word specified on the command line
           into PCR 11, measure identity information of the specified
           file system into PCR 15. The parameter must be the path to
           the established mount point of the file system to measure.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /run/log/systemd/tpm2-measure.log
           Measurements are logged into an event log file maintained in
           /run/log/systemd/tpm2-measure.log, which contains a
           <b>JSON-SEQ</b>[1] series of objects that follow the general
           structure of the <b>TCG Canonical Event Log Format (CEL-JSON)</b>[2]
           event objects (but lack the "recnum" field).

           A <b>LOCK_EX </b>BSD file lock (<a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock(2)</a>) on the log file is
           acquired while the measurement is made and the file is
           updated. Thus, applications that intend to acquire a
           consistent quote from the TPM with the associated snapshot of
           the event log should acquire a <b>LOCK_SH </b>lock while doing so.

           Added in version 252.
