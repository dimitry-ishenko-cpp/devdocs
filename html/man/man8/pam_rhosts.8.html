NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_rhosts - The rhosts PAM module
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_rhosts.so</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This module performs the standard network authentication for
       services, as used by traditional implementations of <b>rlogin </b>and
       <b>rsh </b>etc.

       The authentication mechanism of this module is based on the
       contents of two files; /etc/hosts.equiv (or and ~/.rhosts.
       Firstly, hosts listed in the former file are treated as
       equivalent to the localhost. Secondly, entries in the user's own
       copy of the latter file is used to map "<i>remote-host remote-user</i>"
       pairs to that user's account on the current host. Access is
       granted to the user if their host is present in /etc/hosts.equiv
       and their remote account is identical to their local one, or if
       their remote account has an entry in their personal configuration
       file.

       The module authenticates a remote user (internally specified by
       the item <i>PAM_RUSER</i> connecting from the remote host (internally
       specified by the item <b>PAM_RHOST</b>). Accordingly, for applications
       to be compatible this authentication module they must set these
       items prior to calling <b>pam_authenticate()</b>. The module is not
       capable of independently probing the network connection for such
       information.
