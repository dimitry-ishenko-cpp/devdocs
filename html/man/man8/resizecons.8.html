NAME </h2>
<pre>
       resizecons - change kernel idea of the console size
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>resizecons </b><i>COLSxROWS</i>
       <b>resizecons -lines </b><i>ROWS</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>resizecons</i> command tries to change the videomode of the
       console.  There are several aspects to this: (a) the kernel must
       know about it, (b) the hardware must know about it, (c) user
       programs must know about it, (d) the console font may have to be
       adapted.

       (a) The kernel is told about the change using the ioctl
       VT_RESIZE.  This causes the kernel to reallocate console screen
       memory for all virtual consoles, and might fail if there is not
       enough memory.  (In that case, try to disallocate some virtual
       consoles first.)  If this ioctl succeeds, but a later step fails
       (e.g., because you do not have root permissions), you may be left
       with a very messy screen.

       The most difficult part of this is (b), since it requires
       detailed knowledge of the video card hardware, and the setting of
       numerous registers. Only changing the number of rows is slightly
       easier, and <i>resizecons</i> will try to do that itself, when given the
       <i>-lines</i> option. (Probably, root permission will be required.)  The
       command <i>resizecons COLSxROWS</i> will execute <i>restoretextmode -r</i>
       <i>COLSxROWS</i> (and hence requires that you have svgalib installed).
       Here COLSxROWS is a file that was created earlier by
       <i>restoretextmode -w COLSxROWS.</i>  Again, either root permissions are
       required, or <i>restoretextmode</i> has to be suid root.

       In order to deal with (c), <i>resizecons</i> does a `stty rows ROWS cols
       COLS' for each active console (in the range tty0..tty15), and
       sends a SIGWINCH signal to <i>selection</i> if it finds the file
       /tmp/selection.pid.

       Finally, (d) is dealt with by executing a <i>setfont</i> command. Most
       likely, the wrong font is loaded, and you may want to do another
       <i>setfont</i> yourself afterwards.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>resizecons</i> does not work on all hardware.  This command used to
       be called <i>resize,</i> but was renamed to avoid conflict with another
       command with the same name.
