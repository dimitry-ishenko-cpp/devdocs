       <b>account ... pam_faillock.so </b>[dir=<i>/path/to/tally-directory</i>]

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This module maintains a list of failed authentication attempts
       per user during a specified interval and locks the account in
       case there were more than <i>deny</i> consecutive failed
       authentications.

       Normally, failed attempts to authenticate <i>root</i> will <b>not </b>cause the
       root account to become blocked, to prevent denial-of-service: if
       your users aren't given shell accounts and root may only login
       via <b>su </b>or at the machine console (not telnet/rsh, etc), this is
       safe.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>{preauth|authfail|authsucc}</b>
           This argument must be set accordingly to the position of this
           module instance in the PAM stack.

           The <i>preauth</i> argument must be used when the module is called
           before the modules which ask for the user credentials such as
           the password. The module just examines whether the user
           should be blocked from accessing the service in case there
           were anomalous number of failed consecutive authentication
           attempts recently. This call is optional if <i>authsucc</i> is used.

           The <i>authfail</i> argument must be used when the module is called
           after the modules which determine the authentication outcome,
           failed. Unless the user is already blocked due to previous
           authentication failures, the module will record the failure
           into the appropriate user tally file.

           The <i>authsucc</i> argument must be used when the module is called
           after the modules which determine the authentication outcome,
           succeeded. Unless the user is already blocked due to previous
           authentication failures, the module will then clear the
           record of the failures in the respective user tally file.
           Otherwise it will return authentication error. If this call
           is not done, the pam_faillock will not distinguish between
           consecutive and non-consecutive failed authentication
           attempts. The <i>preauth</i> call must be used in such case. Due to
           complications in the way the PAM stack can be configured it
           is also possible to call <i>pam_faillock</i> as an account module.
           In such configuration the module must be also called in the
           <i>preauth</i> stage.

       <b>conf=/path/to/config-file</b>
           Use another configuration file instead of the default
           /etc/security/faillock.conf.

       The options for configuring the module behavior are described in
       the <a href="../man5/faillock.conf.5.html">faillock.conf(5)</a> manual page. The options specified on the
       module command line override the values from the configuration
       file.
</pre> <h2>
MODULE TYPES PROVIDED </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>auth </b>and <b>account </b>module types are provided.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           An invalid option was given, the module was not able to
           retrieve the user name, no valid counter file was found, or
           too many failed logins.

       PAM_BUF_ERR
           Memory buffer error.

       PAM_CONV_ERR
           The conversation method supplied by the application failed to
           obtain the username.

       PAM_INCOMPLETE
           The conversation method supplied by the application returned
           PAM_CONV_AGAIN.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           Everything was successful.

       PAM_IGNORE
           User not present in passwd database.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Configuring options on the module command line is not recommend.
       The /etc/security/faillock.conf should be used instead.

       The setup of <i>pam_faillock</i> in the PAM stack is different from the
       <i>pam_tally2</i> module setup.

       Individual files with the failure records are created as owned by
       the user. This allows <b>pam_faillock.so </b>module to work correctly
       when it is called from a screensaver.

       Note that using the module in <b>preauth </b>without the <b>silent </b>option
       specified in /etc/security/faillock.conf or with <i>requisite</i>
       control field leaks an information about existence or
       non-existence of a user account in the system because the
       failures are not recorded for the unknown users. The message
       about the user account being locked is never displayed for
       non-existing user accounts allowing the adversary to infer that a
       particular account is not existing on a system.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Here are two possible configuration examples for
       /etc/pam.d/login. They make <i>pam_faillock</i> to lock the account
       after 4 consecutive failed logins during the default interval of
       15 minutes. Root account will be locked as well. The accounts
       will be automatically unlocked after 20 minutes.

       In the first example the module is called only in the <i>auth</i> phase
       and the module does not print any information about the account
       being blocked by <i>pam_faillock</i>. The <i>preauth</i> call can be added to
       tell users that their logins are blocked by the module and also
       to abort the authentication without even asking for password in
       such case.

       /etc/security/faillock.conf file example:

           deny=4
           unlock_time=1200
           silent

       /etc/pam.d/config file example:

           auth     required       pam_securetty.so
           auth     required       pam_env.so
           auth     required       pam_nologin.so
           # optionally call: auth requisite pam_faillock.so preauth
           # to display the message about account being locked
           auth     [success=1 default=bad] pam_unix.so
           auth     [default=die]  pam_faillock.so authfail
           auth     sufficient     pam_faillock.so authsucc
           auth     required       pam_deny.so
           account  required       pam_unix.so
           password required       pam_unix.so shadow
           session  required       pam_selinux.so close
           session  required       pam_loginuid.so
           session  required       pam_unix.so
           session  required       pam_selinux.so open

       In the second example the module is called both in the <i>auth</i> and
       <i>account</i> phases and the module informs the authenticating user
       when the account is locked if <b>silent </b>option is not specified in
       the faillock.conf.

           auth     required       pam_securetty.so
           auth     required       pam_env.so
           auth     required       pam_nologin.so
           auth     required       pam_faillock.so preauth
           # optionally use requisite above if you do not want to prompt for the password
           # on locked accounts
           auth     sufficient     pam_unix.so
           auth     [default=die]  pam_faillock.so authfail
           auth     required       pam_deny.so
           account  required       pam_faillock.so
           # if you drop the above call to pam_faillock.so the lock will be done also
           # on non-consecutive authentication failures
           account  required       pam_unix.so
           password required       pam_unix.so shadow
           session  required       pam_selinux.so close
           session  required       pam_loginuid.so
           session  required       pam_unix.so
           session  required       pam_selinux.so open

           configured with directory /var/run/faillock mounted on
           virtual memory. For persistent storage use the option <i>dir=</i> in
           file /etc/security/faillock.conf.

       /etc/security/faillock.conf
           the config file for pam_faillock options
