</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       aureport - a tool that produces summary reports of audit daemon
       logs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>aureport </b>[<i>options</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>aureport </b>is a tool that produces summary reports of the audit
       system logs. The aureport utility can also take input from stdin
       as long as the input is the raw log data. The reports have a
       column label at the top to help with interpretation of the
       various fields. Except for the main summary report, all reports
       have the audit event number. You can subsequently lookup the full
       event with ausearch <b>-a </b><i>event number</i>. You may need to specify
       start &amp; stop times if you get multiple hits. The reports produced
       by aureport can be used as building blocks for more complicated
       analysis.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-au</b>, <b>--auth</b>
              Report about authentication attempts

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--avc</b>
              Report about avc messages

       <b>--comm </b>Report about commands run

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--config</b>
              Report about config changes

       <b>-cr</b>, <b>--crypto</b>
              Report about crypto events

       <b>--debug</b>
              Write malformed events that are skipped to stderr.

       <b>--eoe-timeout </b><i>seconds</i>
              Set the end of event parsing timeout. See
              <b>end_of_event_timeout </b>in <a href="../man5/auditd.conf.5.html">auditd.conf(5)</a> for details. Note
              that setting this value will override any configured value
              found in /etc/auditd/auditd.conf.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--event</b>
              Report about events

       <b>--escape </b><i>option</i>
              This option determines if the output is escaped to make
              the content safer for certain uses. The options are <i>raw</i> ,
              <i>tty</i> , <i>shell</i> , and <i>shell_quote</i>. Each mode includes the
              characters of the preceding mode and escapes more
              characters. That is to say <i>shell</i> includes all characters
              escaped by <i>tty</i> and adds more. <i>tty</i> is the default.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>
              Report about files and af_unix sockets

       <b>--failed</b>
              Only select failed events for processing in the reports.
              The default is both success and failed events.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--host</b>
              Report about hosts

       <b>--help </b>Print brief command summary

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interpret</b>
              Interpret  numeric  entities into text. For example, uid
              is converted to account name. The conversion is done using
              the current resources  of  the machine where the search is
              being run. If you have renamed the accounts, or don't have
              the  same  accounts  on your machine, you could get
              misleading results.

       <b>-if</b>, <b>--input </b><i>file</i> | <i>directory</i>
              Use the given <i>file</i> or <i>directory</i> instead of the logs. This
              is to aid analysis where the logs have been moved to
              another machine or only part of a log was saved. The path
              length is limited to 4064 bytes.

       <b>--input-logs</b>
              Use the log file location from auditd.conf as input for
              analysis. This is needed if you are using aureport from a
              cron job.

       <b>--integrity</b>
              Report about integrity events

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--key</b>
              Report about audit rule keys

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--login</b>
              Report about logins

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mods</b>
              Report about account modifications

       <b>-ma</b>, <b>--mac</b>
              Report about Mandatory Access Control (MAC) events

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--anomaly</b>
              Report about anomaly events. These events include NIC
              going into promiscuous mode and programs segfaulting.

       <b>--node </b><i>node-name</i>
              Only select events originating from <i>node name</i> string for
              processing in the reports. The default is to include all
              nodes. Multiple nodes are allowed.

       <b>-nc</b>, <b>--no-config</b>
              Do not include the CONFIG_CHANGE event. This is
              particularly useful for the key report because audit rules
              have key labels in many cases. Using this option gets rid
              of these false positives.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pid</b>
              Report about processes

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--response</b>
              Report about responses to anomaly events

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--syscall</b>
              Report about syscalls

       <b>--success</b>
              Only select successful events for processing in the
              reports. The default is both success and failed events.

       <b>--summary</b>
              Run the summary report that gives a total of the elements
              of the main report. Not all reports have a summary.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--log</b>
              This option will output a report of the start and end
              times for each log.

       <b>--tty  </b>Report about tty keystrokes

       <b>-te</b>, <b>--end </b>[<i>end-date</i>] [<i>end-time</i>]
              Search for events with time stamps equal to or before the
              given end time. The format of end time depends on your
              locale. If the date is omitted, <b>today </b>is assumed. If the
              time is omitted, <b>now </b>is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time
              rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example date
              using the en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An example of
              time is 18:00:00. The date format accepted is influenced
              by the LC_TIME environmental variable.

              You may also use the word: <b>now</b>, <b>recent</b>, <b>this-hour</b>, <b>boot</b>,
              <b>today</b>, <b>yesterday</b>, <b>this-week</b>, <b>week-ago</b>, <b>this-month</b>,
              <b>this-year</b>. <b>Now </b>means starting now. <b>Recent </b>is 10 minutes
              ago. <b>Boot </b>means the time of day to the second when the
              system last booted. <b>Today </b>means now. <b>Yesterday </b>is 1 second
              after midnight the previous day. <b>This-week </b>means starting
              1 second after midnight on day 0 of the week determined by
              your locale (see <b>localtime</b>). <b>Week-ago </b>means 1 second after
              midnight exactly 7 days ago. <b>This-month </b>means 1 second
              after midnight on day 1 of the month. <b>This-year </b>means the
              1 second after midnight on the first day of the first
              month.

       <b>-tm</b>, <b>--terminal</b>
              Report about terminals

       <b>-ts</b>, <b>--start </b>[<i>start-date</i>] [<i>start-time</i>]
              Search for events with time stamps equal to or after the
              given end time. The format of end time depends on your
              locale. If the date is omitted, <b>today </b>is assumed. If the
              time is omitted, <b>midnight </b>is assumed. Use 24 hour clock
              time rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example date
              using the en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An example of
              time is 18:00:00. The date format accepted is influenced
              by the LC_TIME environmental variable.

              You may also use the word: <b>now</b>, <b>recent</b>, <b>this-hour</b>, <b>boot</b>,
              <b>today</b>, <b>yesterday</b>, <b>this-week</b>, <b>week-ago</b>, <b>this-month</b>,
              <b>this-year</b>. <b>Boot </b>means the time of day to the second when
              the system last booted. <b>Today </b>means starting at 1 second
              after midnight. <b>Recent </b>is 10 minutes ago. <b>Yesterday </b>is 1
              second after midnight the previous day. <b>This-week </b>means

NOTE </h2>
<pre>
       The boot time option is a convenience function and has
       limitations. The time it calculates is based on time now minus
       /proc/uptime. If after boot the system clock has been adjusted,
       perhaps by ntp, then the calculation may be wrong. In that case
       you'll need to fully specify the time. You can check the time it
       would use by running:

       date -d "`cut -f1 -d. /proc/uptime` seconds ago"
