NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-sysusers, systemd-sysusers.service - Allocate system
       users and groups
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>systemd-sysusers </b>[OPTIONS...] [<i>CONFIGFILE</i>...]

       systemd-sysusers.service
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-sysusers </b>creates system users and groups, based on files
       in the format described in <a href="../man5/sysusers.d.5.html">sysusers.d(5)</a>.

       If invoked with no arguments, directives from the configuration
       files found in the directories specified by <a href="../man5/sysusers.d.5.html">sysusers.d(5)</a>. When
       invoked with positional arguments, if option <b>--replace=</b><i>PATH</i> is
       specified, arguments specified on the command line are used
       instead of the configuration file <i>PATH</i>. Otherwise, just the
       configuration specified by the command line arguments is
       executed. If the string "-" is specified instead of a filename,
       the configuration is read from standard input. If the argument is
       a file name (without any slashes), all configuration directories
       are searched for a matching file and the file found that has the
       highest priority is executed. If the argument is a path, that
       file is used directly without searching the configuration
       directories for any other matching file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--root=</b><i>root</i>
           Takes a directory path as an argument. All paths will be
           prefixed with the given alternate <i>root</i> path, including config
           search paths.

           Added in version 215.

       <b>--image=</b><i>image</i>
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If
           specified all operations are applied to file system in the
           indicated disk image. This is similar to <b>--root= </b>but operates
           on file systems stored in disk images or block devices. The
           disk image should either contain just a file system or a set
           of file systems within a GPT partition table, following the
           <b>Discoverable Partitions Specification</b>[1]. For further
           information on supported disk images, see <a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a>'s
           switch of the same name.

           Added in version 247.

       <b>--image-policy=</b><i>policy</i>
           Takes an image policy string as argument, as per
           <a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy(7)</a>. The policy is enforced when
           operating on the disk image specified via <b>--image=</b>, see
           above. If not specified defaults to the "*" policy, i.e. all
           recognized file systems in the image are used.

       <b>--replace=</b><i>PATH</i>
           When this option is given, one or more positional arguments
           must be specified. All configuration files found in the
           directories listed in <a href="../man5/sysusers.d.5.html">sysusers.d(5)</a> will be read, and the
           configuration given on the command line will be handled
           instead of and with the same priority as the configuration
           file <i>PATH</i>.

           This option is intended to be used when package installation
           scripts are running and files belonging to that package are
           not yet available on disk, so their contents must be given on
           the command line, but the admin configuration might already
           exist and should be given higher priority.

           <b>Example 1. RPM installation script for radvd</b>

               echo 'u radvd - "radvd daemon"' | \
                         systemd-sysusers --replace=/usr/lib/sysusers.d/radvd.conf -

           This will create the radvd user as if
           /usr/lib/sysusers.d/radvd.conf was already on disk. An admin
           might override the configuration specified on the command
           line by placing /etc/sysusers.d/radvd.conf or even
           /etc/sysusers.d/00-overrides.conf.

           Note that this is the expanded form, and when used in a
           package, this would be written using a macro with "radvd" and
           a file containing the configuration line as arguments.

           Added in version 238.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
           Process the configuration and figure out what entries would
           be created, but don't actually write anything.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--inline</b>
           Treat each positional argument as a separate configuration
           line instead of a file name.

           Added in version 238.

       <b>--cat-config</b>
           Copy the contents of config files to standard output. Before
           each file, the filename is printed as a comment.

       <b>--tldr</b>
           Copy the contents of config files to standard output. Only
           the "interesting" parts of the configuration files are
           printed, comments and empty lines are skipped. Before each
           file, the filename is printed as a comment.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.
</pre> <h2>
CREDENTIALS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-sysusers </b>supports the service credentials logic as
       implemented by <i>ImportCredential=</i>/<i>LoadCredential=</i>/<i>SetCredential=</i>
       (see <a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a> for details). The following credentials are
       used when passed in:

       <i>passwd.hashed-password.user</i>
           A UNIX hashed password string to use for the specified user,
           when creating an entry for it. This is particularly useful
           for the "root" user as it allows provisioning the default
           root password to use via a unit file drop-in or from a
           container manager passing in this credential. Note that
           setting this credential has no effect if the specified user
           account already exists. This credential is hence primarily
           useful in first boot scenarios or systems that are fully
           stateless and come up with an empty /etc/ on every boot.

           Added in version 249.

       <i>passwd.plaintext-password.user</i>
           Similar to "passwd.hashed-password.<i>user</i>" but expect a
           literal, plaintext password, which is then automatically
           hashed before used for the user account. If both the hashed
           and the plaintext credential are specified for the same user
           the former takes precedence. It's generally recommended to
           specify the hashed version; however in test environments with
           weaker requirements on security it might be easier to pass
           passwords in plaintext instead.

           Added in version 249.

       <i>passwd.shell.user</i>
           Specifies the shell binary to use for the specified account
           when creating it.

           Added in version 249.

       <i>sysusers.extra</i>
           The contents of this credential may contain additional lines
           to operate on. The credential contents should follow the same
           format as any other sysusers.d/ drop-in. If this credential
           is passed it is processed after all of the drop-in files read
           from the file system.

           Added in version 252.

       Note that by default the systemd-sysusers.service unit file is
       set up to inherit the "passwd.hashed-password.root",
       "passwd.plaintext-password.root", "passwd.shell.root" and
       "sysusers.extra" credentials from the service manager. Thus, when
       invoking a container with an unpopulated /etc/ for the first time
       it is possible to configure the root user's password to be
       "systemd" like this:

           # systemd-nspawn --image=... --set-credential=passwd.hashed-password.root:'$y$j9T$yAuRJu1o5HioZAGDYPU5d.$F64ni6J2y2nNQve90M/p0ZP0ECP/qqzipNyaY9fjGpC' ...

       Note again that the data specified in this credential is
       consulted only when creating an account for the first time, it
       may not be used for changing the password or shell of an account
       that already exists.

       Use <b>mkpasswd</b>(1) for generating UNIX password hashes from the
       command line.

       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
