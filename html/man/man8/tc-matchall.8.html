NAME </h2>
<pre>
       matchall - traffic control filter that matches every packet
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tc filter </b>... <b>matchall </b>[ <b>skip_sw </b>| <b>skip_hw  </b>] [ <b>action</b>
               <i>ACTION_SPEC</i> ] [ <b>classid </b><i>CLASSID</i> ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>matchall </b>filter allows one to classify every packet that
       flows on the port and run a action on it.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>action </b><i>ACTION_SPEC</i>
              Apply an action from the generic actions framework on
              matching packets.

       <b>classid </b><i>CLASSID</i>
              Push matching packets into the class identified by
              <i>CLASSID</i>.

       <b>skip_sw</b>
              Do not process filter by software. If hardware has no
              offload support for this filter, or TC offload is not
              enabled for the interface, operation will fail.

       <b>skip_hw</b>
              Do not process filter by hardware.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To create ingress mirroring from port eth1 to port eth2:

              tc qdisc  add dev eth1 handle ffff: clsact
              tc filter add dev eth1 ingress                \
                      matchall skip_sw                      \
                      action mirred egress mirror           \
                      dev eth2

       The first command creates a clsact qdisc with handle <b>ffff: </b>on
       device <b>eth1 </b>where the second command attaches a matchall filters
       on it that mirrors the packets to device eth2 for ingress.

       To create egress mirroring from port eth1 to port eth2:

              tc qdisc add dev eth1 handle ffff: clsact
              tc filter add dev eth1 egress                  \
                      matchall skip_sw                       \
                      action mirred egress mirror            \
                      dev eth2

       The first command creates a clsact qdisc with handle <b>ffff: </b>on
       device <b>eth1 </b>where the second command attaches a matchall filters
       on it that mirrors the packets to device eth2 for egress.

       To sample one of every 100 packets flowing into interface eth0 to
       psample group 12:

              tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle ffff: ingress
              tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: matchall \
                   action sample rate 100 group 12
