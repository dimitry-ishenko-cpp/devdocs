NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flowtop - top-like netfilter TCP/UDP/SCTP/DCCP/ICMP(v6) flow
       tracking
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>flowtop </b>{ [<i>options</i>] }
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       flowtop is a top-like connection tracking tool that can run on an
       end host or small home router. It is able to present TCP,
       UDP/UDP-lite, SCTP, DCCP, and ICMP(v6) flows that have been
       collected by the kernel's netfilter connection tracking
       framework, thus no packet capturing in user space needs to be
       done.

       flowtop is able to give you a quick overview of current
       connections on your local system, e.g. for debugging purposes or
       to answer questions like:

           * If you access website X, what other connections are being
       opened in
             the background that I'm not aware of?
           * What connections are active that pass one's router?
           * I have this proprietary binary Y, to where does it connect?
           * To which countries am I sending data?
           * Are there any suspicious background connections on my
       machine?
           * How many active connections does binary Y have?
           * How long are connections active already?
           * At which rate am I sending/receiving data?

       The following information will be presented in flowtop's output:

           * Application name and PID when run on local machine
           * Reverse DNS for source and destination
           * Geo-location information (country, city)
           * Used protocols (IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, SCTP, ICMP, ...)
           * Flow port's service name heuristic
           * Transport protocol state machine information
           * Byte/packet counters (if they are enabled)
           * Connection duration (if timestamping is enabled)
           * Flow send/receive rate (if byte/packet counters are
       enabled)

       In order for flowtop to work, netfilter must be active and
       running on your machine, thus kernel-side connection tracking is
       active. If netfilter is not running, you can activate it with
       <a href="iptables.8.html">iptables(8)</a>:

           iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j
           ACCEPT

           iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j
           ACCEPT

       or by loading the following kernel modules:

           modprobe nf_conntrack_ipv4

           modprobe nf_conntrack_ipv6

       To dump byte/packet counters flowtop enables the <a href="sysctl.8.html">sysctl(8)</a>
       parameter <b>net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct </b>via:

           echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_acct

       and resets it to the previously set value on exit. These counters
       will only be active on connections which were created after
       accounting was enabled. Thus, to have these counters be active
       all the time the parameter should be enabled after the system is
       up. To automatically enable it, <b>sysctl.conf</b>(8) or <b>sysctl.d</b>(8)
       might be used.

       To calculate the connection duration flowtop enables the
       <a href="sysctl.8.html">sysctl(8)</a> parameter <b>net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_timestamp </b>via:

           echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_timestamp

       and resets it to the previously set value on exit.

       flowtop's intention is just to get a quick look over your active
       connections.  If you want logging support, have a look at
       netfilter's <b>conntrack</b>(8) tools instead.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-4, --ipv4</b>
              Display IPv4 flows. That is the default when flowtop is
              started without any arguments.

       <b>-6, --ipv6</b>
              Display IPv6 flows. That is the default when flowtop is
              started without any arguments.

       <b>-T, --tcp</b>
              Display TCP flows. That is the default when flowtop is
              started without any arguments.

       <b>-U, --udp</b>
              Display UDP and UDP-lite flows.

       <b>-D, --dccp</b>
              Display DCCP flows.

       <b>-I, --icmp</b>
              Display ICMP version 4 and version 6 flows.

       <b>-S, --sctp</b>
              Display SCTP flows.

       <b>-n, --no-dns</b>
              Don't perform hostname lookup. Only numeric addresses will
              be shown for flow endpoints.

       <b>-G, --no-geoip</b>
              Don't perform GeoIP lookup. No geographical information
              will be shown for flow endpoints.

       <b>-s, --show-src</b>
              Also show source information of the flow, not only
              destination information.

       <b>-b, --bits</b>
              Show flow rates in bits per second instead of bytes per
              second.

       <b>-u, --update</b>
              The built-in database update mechanism will be invoked to
              get Maxmind's latest database. To configure search
              locations for databases, the file /etc/netsniff-
              ng/geoip.conf contains possible addresses. Thus, to save
              bandwidth or for mirroring Maxmind's databases (to bypass
              their traffic limit policy), different hosts or IP
              addresses can be placed into geoip.conf, separated by a
              newline.

       <b>-t &lt;time&gt;, --interval &lt;time&gt;</b>
              Flow info refresh interval in seconds, default is 1s.

       <b>-v, --version</b>
              Show version information and exit.

       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Show user help and exit.
</pre> <h2>
USAGE EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>flowtop</b>
              Default ncurses output for flowtop that tracks IPv4, IPv6
              flows for TCP.

       <b>flowtop -46UTDISs</b>
              This example enables the maximum display options for
              flowtop.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIG FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Files under /etc/netsniff-ng/ can be modified to extend flowtop's
       service resolution and lookup information.

           * tcp.conf - TCP port/services map
           * udp.conf - UDP port/services map
           * geoip.conf - GeoIP database mirrors
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       With a fairly high rate of connection tracking updates, flowtop
       can become unresponsive for short periods of time while
       scrolling. The right fix would be to replace flowtop's connection
       management backend with a better design with respect to the
       locking approach. This is still on the "todo" list.
