DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>yum </b>is an interactive, rpm based, package manager. It can
       automatically perform system updates, including dependency
       analysis and obsolete processing based on "repository" metadata.
       It can also perform installation of new packages, removal of old
       packages and perform queries on the installed and/or available
       packages among many other commands/services (see below). <b>yum </b>is
       similar to other high level package managers like apt-get and
       smart.

       While there are some graphical interfaces directly to the <b>yum</b>
       code, more recent graphical interface development is happening
       with PackageKit and the gnome-packagekit application.

       <i>command</i> is one of:
        * install package1 [package2] [...]
        * update [package1] [package2] [...]

       Unless the --help or -h option is given, one of the above
       commands must be present.

       Repository configuration is honored in all operations.

       <b>install</b>
              Is used to install the latest version of a package or
              group of packages while ensuring that all dependencies are
              satisfied.  (See <b>Specifying package names </b>for more
              information) If no package matches the given package
              name(s), they are assumed to be a shell glob and any
              matches are then installed. If the name starts with @^
              then it is treated as an environment group (group install
              @^foo), an @ character and it's treated as a group (plain
              group install).

              If the name starts with a "-" character, then a search is
              done within the transaction and any matches are removed.
              Note that Yum options use the same syntax and it may be
              necessary to use "--" to resolve any possible conflicts.

              If the name is a file, then install works like
              localinstall. If the name doesn't match a package, then
              package "provides" are searched (e.g.
              "_sqlitecache.so()(64bit)") as are filelists (Eg.
              "/usr/bin/yum"). Also note that for filelists, wildcards
              will match multiple packages.

              Because install does a lot of work to make it as easy as
              possible to use, there are also a few specific install
              commands "<b>install-n</b>", "<b>install-na</b>" and "<b>install-nevra</b>".
              These only work on package names, and do not process
              wildcards etc.

       <b>update </b>If run without any packages, update will update every
              currently installed package.  If one or more packages or
              package globs are specified, Yum will only update the
              listed packages.  While updating packages, <b>yum </b>will ensure
              that all dependencies are satisfied. (See <b>Specifying</b>
              <b>package names </b>for more information) If the packages or
              globs specified match to packages which are not currently
              installed then update will not install them. update
              operates on groups, files, provides and filelists just
              like the "install" command.

              If the main obsoletes configure option is true (default)
              or the --obsoletes flag is present <b>yum </b>will include
              package obsoletes in its calculations - this makes it
              better for distro-version changes, for example: upgrading
              from somelinux 8.0 to somelinux 9.

              Note that "<b>update</b>" works on installed packages first, and
              only if there are no matches does it look for available
              packages. The difference is most noticeable when you do
              "<b>update </b>foo-1-2" which will act exactly as "<b>update </b>foo" if
              foo-1-2 is installed. You can use the "<b>update-to</b>" if you'd
              prefer that nothing happen in the above case.

       <b>update-to</b>
              This command works like "<b>update</b>" but always specifies the
              version of the package we want to update to.

       <b>update-minimal</b>
              This works like the update command, but if you have the
              package foo-1 installed and have foo-2 (bugfix) and foo-3
              (enhancement) available with updateinfo.xml then update-
              minimal --bugfix will update you to foo-2.

       <b>check-update</b>
              Implemented so you could know if your machine had any
              updates that needed to be applied without running it
              interactively. Returns exit value of 100 if there are
              packages available for an update. Also returns a list of
              the packages to be updated in list format. Returns 0 if no
              packages are available for update. Returns 1 if an error
              occurred.  Running in verbose mode also shows obsoletes.

       <b>upgrade</b>
              Is the same as the update command with the --obsoletes
              flag set. See update for more details.

       <b>upgrade-to</b>
              This command works like "<b>upgrade</b>" but always specifies the
              version of the package we want to update to.

       <b>distribution-synchronization </b>or <b>distro-sync</b>
              Synchronizes the installed package set with the latest
              packages available, this is done by either obsoleting,
              upgrading or downgrading as appropriate. This will
              "normally" do the same thing as the upgrade command
              however if you have the package FOO installed at version
              4, and the latest available is only version 3, then this
              command will <b>downgrade </b>FOO to version 3.

              If you give the optional argument "full", then the command
              will also reinstall packages where the install checksum
              and the available checksum do not match. And remove old
              packages (can be used to sync. rpmdb versions). The
              optional argument "different" can be used to specify the
              default operation.

              This command does not perform operations on groups, local
              packages or negative selections.

       <b>remove </b>or <b>erase</b>
              Are used to remove the specified packages from the system
              as well as removing any packages which depend on the
              package being removed. remove operates on groups, files,
              provides and filelists just like the "install"
              command.(See <b>Specifying package names </b>for more
              information)

              Note that "yum" is included in the protected_packages
              configuration, by default.  So you can't accidentally
              remove yum itself.

              The remove_leaf_only configuration changes the behaviour
              of this command to only remove packages which aren't
              required by something else.

              The clean_requirements_on_remove configuration changes the
              behaviour of this command to also remove packages that are
              only dependencies of this package.

              Because remove does a lot of work to make it as easy as
              possible to use, there are also a few specific remove
              commands "<b>remove-n</b>", "<b>remove-na</b>" and "<b>remove-nevra</b>". These
              only work on package names, and do not process wildcards
              etc.

       <b>autoremove</b>

              With one or more arguments this command works like running
              the "<b>remove</b>" command with the clean_requirements_on_remove
              turned on. However you can also specify no arguments, at
              which point it tries to remove any packages that weren't
              installed explicitly by the user and which aren't required
              by anything (so called leaf packages).

              Because autoremove does a lot of work to make it as easy
              as possible to use, there are also a few specific
              autoremove commands "<b>autoremove-n</b>", "<b>autoremove-na</b>" and
              "<b>autoremove-nevra</b>". These only work on package names, and
              do not process wildcards etc.

       <b>list   </b>Is used to list various information about available
              packages; more complete details are available in the <i>List</i>
              <i>Options</i> section below.

       <b>provides </b>or <b>whatprovides</b>
              Is used to find out which package provides some feature or
              file. Just use a specific name or a file-glob-syntax
              wildcards to list the packages available or installed that
              provide that feature or file.

       <b>search </b>This is used to find packages when you know something
              about the package but aren't sure of it's name. By default
              search will try searching just package names and
              summaries, but if that "fails" it will then try
              descriptions and url.

              Yum search orders the results so that those packages
              matching more terms will appear first.

              You can force searching everything by specifying "all" as
              the first argument.

       <b>info   </b>Is used to list a description and summary information
              about available packages; takes the same arguments as in
              the <i>List Options</i> section below.

       <b>clean  </b>Is used to clean up various things which accumulate in the
              <b>yum </b>cache directory over time.  More complete details can
              be found in the <i>Clean Options</i> section below.

       <b>makecache</b>
              Is used to download and make usable all the metadata for
              the currently enabled <b>yum </b>repos. If the argument "fast" is
              passed, then we just try to make sure the repos are
              current (much like "yum clean expire-cache").

       <b>groups </b>A command, new in 3.4.2, that collects all the subcommands
              that act on groups together. Note that recent yum using
              distributions (Fedora-19+, RHEL-7+) have configured
              group_command=objects which changes how group commands act
              in some important ways.

              "<b>group install</b>" is used to install all of the individual
              packages in a group, of the specified types (this works as
              if you'd taken each of those package names and put them on
              the command line for a "yum install" command).
               The group_package_types configuration option specifies
              which types will be installed.
               If you wish to "reinstall" a group so that you get a
              package that is currently blacklisted the easiest way to
              do that currently is to install the package manually and
              then run "groups mark packages-sync mygroup mypackagename"
              (or use yumdb to set the group_member of the package(s)).

              "<b>group update</b>" is just an alias for group install, when
              using group_command=compat. This will install packages in
              the group not already installed and upgrade existing
              packages. With group_command=simple it will just upgrade
              already installed packages. With group_command=objects it
              will try to upgrade the group object, installing any
              available packages not blacklisted (marked '-' in group
              info) and will upgrade the installed packages.

              "<b>group list</b>" is used to list the available groups from all
              <b>yum </b>repos. When group_command=objects the group is
              installed if the user explicitly installed it (or used the
              group mark* commands to mark it installed).  It does not
              need to have any packages installed.  When not using
              group_command=objects groups are shown as "installed" if
              all mandatory packages are installed, or if a group
              doesn't have any mandatory packages then it is installed
              if any of the optional or default package are installed
              (when not in group_command=objects mode).  You can pass
              optional arguments to the list/summary commands:
              installed, available, environment, language, packages,
              hidden and ids (or any of those prefixed by "no" to turn
              them off again).  Note that groups that are available but
              hidden will not be listed unless Â´hiddenÂ´ keyword is
              passed to the command.  If you pass the -v option, to
              enable verbose mode, then the groupids are displayed by
              default (but "yum group list ids" is often easier to
              read).

              "<b>group remove</b>" is used to remove all of the packages in a
              group, unlike "groupinstall" this will remove everything
              regardless of group_package_types. It is worth pointing
              out that packages can be in more than one group, so "group
              install X Y" followed by "group remove Y" does not do give
              you the same result as "group install X".

              The groupremove_leaf_only configuration changes the
              behaviour of this command to only remove packages which
              aren't required by something else.

              "<b>group info</b>" is used to give the description and package
              list of a group (and which type those packages are marked
              as). Note that you can use the yum-filter-data and yum-
              list-data plugins to get/use the data the other way around
              (i.e. what groups own packages need updating). If you pass
              the -v option, to enable verbose mode, then the package
              names are matched against installed/available packages
              similar to the list command.

              When using group_command=objects, the info command will
              display markers next to each package saying how that
              package relates to the group object. The meaning of these
              markers is:

              "-" = Package isn't installed, and won't be installed as
              part of the group (Eg.  "yum group install foo -pkgA" or
              "yum group install foo; yum remove pkgA" â€¦ this will have
              pkgA marked as '-')
              "+" = Package isn't installed, but will be the next time
              you run "yum upgrade" or "yum group upgrade foo"
              " " = Package is installed, but wasn't installed via the
              group (so "group remove foo" won't remove it).
              "=" = Package is installed, and was installed via the
              group.

              you can move an installed package into an installed group
              using either "group mark package-sync/package-sync-forced"
              or "yumdb set group_member".

              "<b>group summary</b>" is used to give a quick summary of how
              many groups are installed and available.

              "<b>group mark</b>" and "<b>group unmark</b>" are used when groups are
              configured in group_command=objects mode. These commands
              then allow you to alter yum's idea of which groups are
              installed, and the packages that belong to them.

              "<b>group mark install</b>" mark the group as installed. When
              installed "<b>yum upgrade</b>" and "<b>yum group upgrade</b>" will
              install new packages for the group (only those packages
              already installed will be marked as members of the
              installed group to start with).

              "<b>group mark remove</b>" the opposite of mark install.

              "<b>group mark packages</b>" takes a group id (which must be
              installed) and marks any given installed packages (which
              aren't members of a group) as members of the group. Note
              that the data from the repositories does not need to
              specify the packages as a member of the group.

              "<b>group mark packages-force</b>" works like mark packages, but
              doesn't care if the packages are already members of
              another group.

              "<b>group mark blacklist</b>" will blacklist all packages marked
              to be installed for a group. After this command a "yum
              group upgrade" will not install any new packages as part
              of the group.

              "<b>group mark convert-blacklist</b>"

              "<b>group mark convert-whitelist</b>"

              "<b>group mark convert</b>" converts the automatic data you get
              without using groups as objects into groups as objects
              data, in other words this will make "yum
              --setopt=group_command=objects groups list" look as
              similar as possible to the current output of "yum
              --setopt=group_command=simple groups list". This makes it
              much easier to convert to groups as objects without having
              to reinstall. For groups that are installed the whitelist
              variant will mark all uninstalled packages for the group
              as to be installed on the next "yum group upgrade", the
              blacklist variant (current default) will mark them all as
              blacklisted.

              "<b>group unmark packages</b>" remove a package as a member from
              any groups.

       <b>shell  </b>Is used to enter the 'yum shell', when a filename is
              specified the contents of that file is executed in yum
              shell mode. See <a href="yum-shell.8.html">yum-shell(8)</a> for more info.

       <b>resolvedep</b>
              Is used to list packages providing the specified
              dependencies, at most one package is listed per
              dependency. This command is maintained for legacy reasons
              only, use repoquery instead.

       <b>localinstall</b>
              Is used to install a set of local rpm files. If required
              the enabled repositories will be used to resolve
              dependencies. Note that the install command will do a
              local install, if given a filename. This command is
              maintained for legacy reasons only.

       <b>localupdate</b>
              Is used to update the system by specifying local rpm
              files. Only the specified rpm files of which an older
              version is already installed will be installed, the
              remaining specified packages will be ignored.  If required
              the enabled repositories will be used to resolve
              dependencies. Note that the update command will do a local
              update, if given a filename. This command is maintained
              for legacy reasons only.

       <b>reinstall</b>
              Will reinstall the identically versioned package as is
              currently installed.  This does not work for "installonly"
              packages, like Kernels. reinstall operates on groups,
              files, provides and filelists just like the "install"
              command.

       <b>downgrade</b>
              Will try and downgrade a package from the version
              currently installed to the previously highest version (or
              the specified version).  The depsolver will not
              necessarily work, but if you specify all the packages it
              should work (thus, all the simple cases will work). Also
              this does not work for "installonly" packages, like
              Kernels. downgrade operates on groups, files, provides,
              filelists and rpm files just like the "install" command.

       <b>swap   </b>At it's simplest this is just a simpler way to remove one
              set of package(s) and install another set of package(s)
              without having to use the "shell" command.  However you
              can specify different commands to call than just remove or
              install, and you can list multiple packages (it splits
              using the "--" marker).  Note that option parsing will
              remove the first "--" in an argument list on the command
              line.

              Examples:

              swap foo bar
              swap -- remove foo -- install bar
              swap foo group install bar-grp
              swap -- group remove foo-grp -- group install bar-grp

       <b>deplist</b>
              Produces a list of all dependencies and what packages
              provide those dependencies for the given packages. As of
              3.2.30 it now just shows the latest version of each
              package that matches (this can be changed by using
              --showduplicates) and it only shows the newest providers
              (which can be changed by using --verbose).

       <b>repolist</b>
              Produces a list of configured repositories. The default is
              to list all enabled repositories. If you pass -v, for
              verbose mode, or use repoinfo then more information is
              listed. If the first argument is Â´enabledÂ´, Â´disabledÂ´ or
              Â´allÂ´ then the command will list those types of repos.

              You can pass repo id or name arguments, or wildcards which
              to match against both of those. However if the id or name
              matches exactly then the repo will be listed even if you
              are listing enabled repos and it is disabled.

              In non-verbose mode the first column will start with a Â´*Â´
              if the repo. has metalink data and the latest metadata is
              not local and will start with a Â´!Â´ if the repo. has
              metadata that is expired (this can happen due to
              metadata_expire_filter). For non-verbose mode the last
              column will also display the number of packages in the
              repo. and (if there are any user specified excludes) the
              number of packages excluded.

              One last special feature of repolist, is that if you are
              in non-verbose mode then yum will ignore any repo errors
              and output the information it can get (Eg. "yum clean all;
              yum -C repolist" will output something, although the
              package counts/etc. will be zeroed out).

       <b>repoinfo</b>

              This command works exactly like repolist -v.

       <b>repository-packages</b>
              Treat a repo. as a collection of packages (like "yum
              groups") allowing the user to install or remove them as a
              single entity.

              "repository-packages &lt;repo&gt; list" - Works like the "yum
              list" command, but only shows packages from the given
              repository.

              "repository-packages &lt;repo&gt; info" - Works like the "yum
              info" command, but only shows packages from the given
              repository.

              "repository-packages &lt;repo&gt; check-update" - Works like the
              "yum check-update" command, but only shows packages from
              the given repository.

              "repository-packages &lt;repo&gt; install" - Install all of the
              packages in the repository, basically the same as: yum
              install $(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a).  Specific
              packages/wildcards can be specified.

              "repository-packages &lt;repo&gt; upgrade" - Update all of the
              packages in the repository, basically the same as: yum
              upgrade $(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a).  Specific
              packages/wildcards can be specified.

              "repository-packages &lt;repo&gt; upgrade-to" - Update all of
              the packages in the repository, basically the same as: yum
              upgrade $(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a).  Without
              arguments it works the same as upgrade, with arguments it
              just interprets them as the versions you want to move to.

              "repository-packages &lt;repo&gt; reinstall-old" - ReInstall all
              of the packages that are installed from the repository and
              available in the repository, similar to: yum reinstall
              $(yumdb search-quiet from_repo &lt;repo&gt;).

              "repository-packages &lt;repo&gt; move-to" - ReInstall all of
              the packages that are available in the repository,
              basically the same as: yum reinstall $(repoquery
              --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a).

              "repository-packages &lt;repo&gt; reinstall" - Tries to do
              reinstall-old, but if that produces no packages then tries
              move-to.

              "repo-pkgs &lt;repo&gt; remove" - Remove all of the packages in
              the repository, very similar to: yum remove $(repoquery
              --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a). However the repopkgsremove_leaf_only
              option is obeyed.

              "repo-pkgs &lt;repo&gt; remove-or-reinstall" - Works like remove
              for any package that doesn't have the exact same version
              in another repository. For any package that does have the
              exact NEVRA in another repository then that version will
              be reinstalled.

              "repo-pkgs &lt;repo&gt; remove-or-distro-sync" - Works like
              remove for any package that doesn't exist in another
              repository. For any package that does exist it tries to
              work as if distro-sync was called (with the repo.
              disabled).

       <b>version</b>
              Produces a "version" of the rpmdb, and of the enabled
              repositories if "all" is given as the first argument. You
              can also specify version groups in the version-groups
              configuration file. If you pass -v, for verbose mode, more
              information is listed. The version is calculated by taking
              an SHA1 hash of the packages (in sorted order), and the
              checksum_type/checksum_data entries from the yumdb. Note
              that this rpmdb version is now also used significantly
              within yum (esp. in yum history).

              The version command will now show "groups" of packages as
              a separate version, and so takes sub-commands:

              "version grouplist" - List the defined version groups.

              "version groupinfo" - Get the complete list of packages
              within one or more version groups.

              "version installed" - This is the default, only show the
              version information for installed packages.

              "version available" - Only show the version information
              for available packages.

              "version all" - Show the version information for installed
              and available packages.

              "version nogroups | nogroups-*" - Just show the main
              version information.

              "version group-*" - Just show the grouped version
              information, if more arguments are given then only show
              the data for those groups.

       <b>history</b>
              The history command allows the user to view what has
              happened in past transactions (assuming the history_record
              config. option is set). You can use info/list/packages-
              list/packages-info/summary to view what happened,
              undo/redo/rollback to act on that information and new to
              start a new history file.

              The info/list/summary commands take either a transaction
              id or a package (with wildcards, as in <b>Specifying package</b>
              <b>names</b>), all three can also be passed no arguments. list
              can be passed the keyword "all" to list all the
              transactions.

              The info command can also take ranges of transaction ids,
              of the form start..end, which will then display a merged
              history as if all the transactions in the range had
              happened at once.
              Eg. "history info 1..4" will merge the first four
              transactions and display them as a single transaction.

              The packages-list/packages-info commands takes a package
              (with wildcards, as in <b>Specifying package names</b>). And show
              data from the point of view of that package.

              The undo/redo/rollback commands take either a single
              transaction id or the keyword last and an offset from the
              last transaction (Eg. if you've done 250 transactions,
              "last" refers to transaction 250, and "last-4" refers to
              transaction 246).  The redo command can also take some
              optional arguments before you specify the transaction.
              "force-reinstall" tells it reinstall any packages that
              were installed in that transaction (via install, upgrade
              or downgrade).  "force-remove" tells it to forcibly remove
              any packages that were updated or downgraded.

              The undo/redo commands act on the specified transaction,
              undo'ing or repeating the work of that transaction. While
              the rollback command will undo all transactions up to the
              point of the specified transaction. For example, if you
              have 3 transactions, where package A; B and C where
              installed respectively.  Then "undo 1" will try to remove
              package A, "redo 1" will try to install package A (if it
              is not still installed), and "rollback 1" will try to
              remove packages B and C. Note that after a "rollback 1"
              you will have a fourth transaction, although the ending
              rpmdb version (see: yum version) should be the same in
              transactions 1 and 4.

              The addon-info command takes a transaction ID, and the
              packages-list command takes a package (with wildcards).

              The stats command shows some statistics about the current
              history DB.

              The sync commands allows you to change the rpmdb/yumdb
              data stored for any installed packages, to whatever is in
              the current rpmdb/yumdb (this is mostly useful when this
              data was not stored when the package went into the history
              DB).

              In "history list" you can change the behaviour of the 2nd
              column via the configuration option history_list_view.

              In "history list" output the Altered column also gives
              some extra information if there was something not good
              with the transaction (this is also shown at the end of the
              package column in the packages-list command).

              <b>&gt; </b>- The rpmdb was changed, outside yum, after the
              transaction.
              <b>&lt; </b>- The rpmdb was changed, outside yum, before the
              transaction.
              <b>* </b>- The transaction aborted before completion.
              <b># </b>- The transaction completed, but with a non-zero status.
              <b>E </b>- The transaction completed fine, but had warning/error
              output during the transaction.
              <b>P </b>- The transaction completed fine, but problems already
              existed in the rpmdb.
              <b>s </b>- The transaction completed fine, but --skip-broken was
              enabled and had to skip some packages.

       <b>load-transaction</b>
              This command will re-load a saved yum transaction file,
              this allows you to run a transaction on one machine and
              then use it on another.  The two common ways to get a
              saved yum transaction file are from "yum -q history addon-
              info last saved_tx" or via the automatic saves in
              $TMPDIR/yum_save_tx.* when a transaction is solved but not
              run.

              Running the command without an argument, or a directory as
              an argument will try and list the possible files available
              to load. Showing if the packages are still available, if
              the rpmdb matches the current rpmdb, how many transaction
              install/removes members are in the saved transaction and
              what the filename is.

       <b>updateinfo</b>
              This command has a bunch of sub-commands to act on the
              updateinfo in the repositories. The simplest commands are:

               yum updateinfo info [all | available | installed |
              updates]
               yum updateinfo list [all | available | installed |
              updates]
               yum updateinfo [summary] [all | available | installed |
              updates]

              which all display information about the available update
              information relevant to your machine (including anything
              installed, if you supply "all").

               <b>* updates </b>Is used to display information about advisories
              for packages that can be updated. This is the default.
               <b>* installed </b>Is used to display information only about
              installed advisories.
               <b>* available </b>Is used to display information about
              advisories for packages available for updating or
              installation.
               <b>* all </b>Is used to display information about both installed
              and available advisories.

              They all take as arguments:

               <b>* &lt;advisory&gt; [advisory...]  </b>Is used to display
              information about one or more advisories.

               <b>* &lt;package&gt; [package...]  </b>Is used to display information
              about one or more packages.

               <b>* bugzillas / bzs </b>Is the subset of the updateinfo
              information, pertaining to the bugzillas.

               <b>* cves </b>Is the subset of the updateinfo information,
              pertaining to the CVEs.

               <b>* enhancement </b>Is the subset of the updateinfo
              information, pertaining to enhancements.

               <b>* bugfix </b>Is the subset of the updateinfo information,
              pertaining to bugfixes.

               <b>* security / sec </b>Is the subset of the updateinfo
              information, pertaining to security.

               <b>* severity / sev </b>Include security relevant packages of
              this severity.

               <b>* recommended </b>Is the subset of the updateinfo
              information, pertaining to recommended updates.

               <b>* new-packages </b>Is the subset of the updateinfo
              information, pertaining to new packages. These are
              packages which weren't available at the initial release of
              your distribution.

              There are also three sub-commands to remove packages when
              using "yum shell", they are:

               yum updateinfo remove-pkgs-ts

               yum updateinfo exclude-updates

               yum updateinfo exclude-all

              they all take the following arguments:

              * [bzs=foo] [advisories=foo] [cves=foo] [security-
              severity=foo] [security] [bugfix]

              and finally there is a command to manually check the
              running kernel against updateinfo data:

               yum updateinfo check-running-kernel

       <b>fssnapshot </b>or <b>fssnap</b>
              This command has a few sub-commands to act on the LVM data
              of the host, to list snapshots and to create and remove
              them. The simplest commands, to display information about
              the configured LVM snapshotable devices, are:

               yum fssnapshot [summary]
               yum fssnapshot list
               yum fssnapshot have-space

              then you can create and delete snapshots using:

               yum fssnapshot create
               yum fssnapshot delete &lt;device(s)&gt;

              Configuration Options: <b>fssnap_automatic_pre</b>,
              <b>fssnap_automatic_post</b>, <b>fssnap_automatic_keep</b>,
              <b>fssnap_percentage</b>, <b>fssnap_devices</b>, <b>fssnap_abort_on_errors</b>

       <b>fs     </b>This command has a few sub-commands to act on the
              filesystem data of the host, mainly for removing
              languages/documentation for minimal installs:

               yum fs filters

               yum fs refilter [package(s)]

               yum fs refilter-cleanup [package(s)]

               yum fs du [path]

               yum fs status [path]

               yum fs diff [path]

              the first 3 being a simple interface to change yum.conf
              altering the tsflags and override_install_langs
              configurations. The refilter command is an optimized way
              of calling "yum reinstall" to reinstall the packages with
              the new filters applied. The refilter-cleanup command is
              needed because rpm doesn't actually remove the files on
              reinstall, as it should. And the du/status/diff commands
              are included so you can easily see the space used/saved
              and any other changes.

       <b>check  </b>Checks the local rpmdb and produces information on any
              problems it finds. You can pass the check command the
              arguments "dependencies", "duplicates", "obsoleted" or
              "provides", to limit the checking that is performed (the
              default is "all" which does all).

       <b>help   </b>Produces help, either for all commands or if given a
              command name then the help for that particular command.

GENERAL OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Most command line options can be set using the configuration file
       as well and the descriptions indicate the necessary configuration
       option to set.

       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Help; display a help message and then quit.

       <b>-y, --assumeyes</b>
              Assume yes; assume that the answer to any question which
              would be asked is yes.
              Configuration Option: <b>assumeyes</b>

       <b>--assumeno</b>
              Assume no; assume that the answer to any question which
              would be asked is no. This option overrides assumeyes, but
              is still subject to alwaysprompt.
              Configuration Option: <b>assumeno</b>

       <b>-c, --config=[config file]</b>
              Specifies the config file location - can take HTTP and FTP
              URLs and local file paths.

       <b>-q, --quiet</b>
              Run without output.  Note that you likely also want to use
              -y.

       <b>-v, --verbose</b>
              Run with a lot of debugging output.

       <b>-d, --debuglevel=[number]</b>
              Sets the debugging level to [number] - turns up or down
              the amount of things that are printed. Practical range: 0
              - 10
              Configuration Option: <b>debuglevel</b>

       <b>-e, --errorlevel=[number]</b>
              Sets the error level to [number] Practical range 0 - 10. 0
              means print only critical errors about which you must be
              told. 1 means print all errors, even ones that are not
              overly important. 1+ means print more errors (if any) -e 0
              is good for cron jobs.
              Configuration Option: <b>errorlevel</b>

       <b>--rpmverbosity=[name]</b>
              Sets the debug level to [name] for rpm scriptlets. 'info'
              is the default, other options are: 'critical',
              'emergency', 'error', 'warn' and 'debug'.
              Configuration Option: <b>rpmverbosity</b>

       <b>-R, --randomwait=[time in minutes]</b>
              Sets the maximum amount of time yum will wait before
              performing a command - it randomizes over the time.

       <b>-C, --cacheonly</b>
              Tells yum to run entirely from system cache; does not
              download or update metadata.  When this is used by a
              non-root user, yum will run entirely from user cache in
              $TMPDIR.  This option doesn't stop yum from updating user
              cache from system cache locally if the latter is newer
              (this is always done when running as a user).

       <b>--version</b>
              Reports the <b>yum </b>version number and installed package
              versions for everything in history_record_packages (can be
              added to by plugins).

       <b>--showduplicates</b>
              Doesn't limit packages to their latest versions in the
              info, list and search commands (will also affect plugins
              which use the doPackageLists() API).

       <b>--installroot=root</b>
              Specifies an alternative installroot, relative to which
              all packages will be installed. Think of this like doing
              "chroot &lt;root&gt; yum" except using --installroot allows yum
              to work before the chroot is created.  Note: You may also
              want to use the option --releasever=/ when creating the
              installroot as otherwise the $releasever value is taken
              from the rpmdb within the installroot (and thus. will be
              empty, before creation).
              Configuration Option: <b>installroot</b>

       <b>--enablerepo=repoidglob</b>
              Enables specific repositories by id or glob that have been
              disabled in the configuration file using the enabled=0
              option.
              Configuration Option: <b>enabled</b>

       <b>--disablerepo=repoidglob</b>
              Disables specific repositories by id or glob.
              Configuration Option: <b>enabled</b>

       <b>--obsoletes</b>
              This option only has affect for an update, it enables
              <b>yum</b>Â´s obsoletes processing logic. For more information see
              the <b>update </b>command above.
              Configuration Option: <b>obsoletes</b>

       <b>-x, --exclude=package</b>
              Exclude a specific package by name or glob from all
              repositories, so yum works as if that package was never in
              the repositories.  This is commonly used so a package
              isn't upgraded or installed accidentally, but can be used
              to remove packages in any way that "yum list" will show
              packages.

              Can be disabled using --disableexcludes.  Configuration
              Option: <b>exclude</b>, <b>includepkgs</b>

       <b>--color=[always|auto|never]</b>
              Display colorized output automatically, depending on the
              output terminal, always (using ANSI codes) or never. Note
              that some commands (Eg. list and info) will do a little
              extra work when color is enabled.  Configuration Option:
              <b>color</b>

       <b>--disableexcludes=[all|main|repoid]</b>
              Disable the excludes defined in your config files. Takes
              one of three options:
              all == disable all excludes
              main == disable excludes defined in [main] in yum.conf
              repoid == disable excludes defined for that repo

       <b>--disableincludes=[all|repoid]</b>
              Disable the includes defined in your config files. Takes
              one of two options:
              all == disable all includes
              repoid == disable includes defined for that repo

       <b>--disableplugin=plugin</b>
              Run with one or more plugins disabled, the argument is a
              comma separated list of wildcards to match against plugin
              names.

       <b>--noplugins</b>
              Run with all plugins disabled.
              Configuration Option: <b>plugins</b>

       <b>--nogpgcheck</b>
              Run with GPG signature checking disabled.
              Configuration Option: <b>gpgcheck</b>

       <b>--skip-broken</b>
              Resolve depsolve problems by removing packages that are
              causing problems from the transaction.
              Configuration Option: <b>skip_broken</b>

       <b>--releasever=version</b>
              Pretend the current release version is the given string.
              This is very useful when combined with --installroot. You
              can also use --releasever=/ to take the releasever
              information from outside the installroot.  Note that with
              the default upstream cachedir, of /var/cache/yum, using
              this option will corrupt your cache (and you can use
              $releasever in your cachedir configuration to stop this).

       <b>-t, --tolerant</b>
              This option makes yum go slower, checking for things that
              shouldn't be possible making it more tolerant of external
              errors.

       <b>--downloadonly</b>
              Don't update, just download. This is done in the
              background, so the yum lock is released for other
              operations. This can also be chosen by typing
              'd'ownloadonly at the transaction confirmation prompt.

       <b>--downloaddir=directory</b>
              Specifies an alternate directory to store packages.

       <b>--setopt=option=value</b>
              Set any config option in yum config or repo files. For
              options in the global config just use:
              --setopt=option=value for repo options use:
              --setopt=repoid.option=value

       <b>--security</b>
              This option includes packages that say they fix a security
              issue, in updates.

       <b>--advisory=ADVS, --advisories=ADVS</b>
              This option includes in updates packages corresponding to
              the advisory ID, Eg. FEDORA-2201-123.

       <b>--bz=BZS</b>
              This option includes in updates packages that say they fix
              a Bugzilla ID, Eg. 123.

       <b>--cve=CVES</b>
              This option includes in updates packages that say they fix
              a CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ID
              (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/about/">http://cve.mitre.org/about/</a>), Eg. CVE-2201-0123.

       <b>--bugfix</b>
              This option includes in updates packages that say they fix
              a bugfix issue.

       <b>--sec-severity=SEVS, --secseverity=SEVS</b>
              This option includes in updates security relevant packages
              of the specified severity.
</pre> <h2>
LIST OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following are the ways which you can invoke <b>yum </b>in list mode.
       Note that all <b>list </b>commands include information on the version of
       the package.

       <b>OUTPUT</b>

              The format of the output of yum list is:

              name.arch [epoch:]version-release  repo or @installed-
              from-repo

              Note that if the repo cannot be determined, "installed" is
              printed instead.

       <b>yum list [all | glob_exp1] [glob_exp2] [...]</b>
              List all available and installed packages.

       <b>yum list available [glob_exp1] [...]</b>
              List all packages in the yum repositories available to be
              installed.

       <b>yum list updates [glob_exp1] [...]</b>
              List all packages with updates available in the yum
              repositories.

       <b>yum list installed [glob_exp1] [...]</b>
              List the packages specified by <i>args</i>.  If an argument does
              not match the name of an available package, it is assumed
              to be a shell-style glob and any matches are printed.

       <b>yum list extras [glob_exp1] [...]</b>
              List the packages installed on the system that are not
              available in any yum repository listed in the config file.

       <b>yum list distro-extras [glob_exp1] [...]</b>
              List the packages installed on the system that are not
              available, by name, in any yum repository listed in the
              config file.

       <b>yum list obsoletes [glob_exp1] [...]</b>
              List the packages installed on the system that are
              obsoleted by packages in any yum repository listed in the
              config file.

       <b>yum list recent</b>
              List packages recently added into the repositories. This
              is often not helpful, but what you may really want to use
              is "yum updateinfo list new" although that relies on
              updateinfo data from the repos.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING PACKAGE NAMES </h2>
<pre>
       A package can be referred to for install, update, remove, list,
       info etc with any of the following as well as globs of any of the
       following:

              <b>name</b>
              <b>name.arch</b>
              <b>name-ver</b>
              <b>name-ver-rel</b>
              <b>name-ver-rel.arch</b>
              <b>name-epoch:ver-rel.arch</b>
              <b>epoch:name-ver-rel.arch</b>

              For example: <b>yum remove kernel-2.4.1-10.i686</b>
                   this will remove this specific kernel-ver-rel.arch.

              Or:          <b>yum list available 'foo*'</b>
                   will list all available packages that match 'foo*'.
              (The single quotes will keep your shell from expanding the
              globs.)
</pre> <h2>
CLEAN OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following are the ways which you can invoke <b>yum </b>in clean
       mode.

       Note that these commands only operate on the currently enabled
       repositories within the current <b>cachedir </b>(that is, with any
       substitution variables such as $releasever expanded to their
       runtime values).  To clean specific repositories, use
       <b>--enablerepo</b>, <b>--disablerepo </b>or <b>--releasever </b>accordingly.  Note,
       however, that untracked (no longer configured) repositories
       cannot be cleaned this way; they have to be removed manually.

       <b>yum clean expire-cache</b>
              Eliminate the local data saying when the metadata and
              mirrorlists were downloaded for each repo. This means yum
              will revalidate the cache for each repo. next time it is
              used. However if the cache is still valid, nothing
              significant was deleted.

       <b>yum clean packages</b>
              Eliminate any cached packages from the system.  Note that
              packages are not automatically deleted after they are
              downloaded.

       <b>yum clean headers</b>
              Eliminate all of the header files, which old versions of
              yum used for dependency resolution.

       <b>yum clean metadata</b>
              Eliminate all of the files which yum uses to determine the
              remote availability of packages. Using this option will
              force yum to download all the metadata the next time it is
              run.

       <b>yum clean dbcache</b>
              Eliminate the sqlite cache used for faster access to
              metadata.  Using this option will force yum to download
              the sqlite metadata the next time it is run, or recreate
              the sqlite metadata if using an older repo.

       <b>yum clean rpmdb</b>
              Eliminate any cached data from the local rpmdb.

       <b>yum clean plugins</b>
              Tell any enabled plugins to eliminate their cached data.

       <b>yum clean all</b>
              Does all of the above.  As a convenience, if this command
              does not result in a completely empty cache due to the
              restrictions outlined at the beginning of this section, a
              message will be printed, saying how much disk space can be
              reclaimed by cleaning the remaining repos manually.  For
              this purpose, a repo is considered clean when its disk
              usage doesn't exceed 64KB (that is to account for
              directory entries and tiny metadata files such as
              "productid" that are never cleaned).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To list all updates that are security relevant, and get a return
       code on whether there are security updates use:

              yum --security check-update

       To upgrade packages that have security errata (upgrades to the
       latest available package) use:

              yum --security update

       To upgrade packages that have security errata (upgrades to the
       last security errata package) use:

              yum --security update-minimal

       To get a list of all BZs that are fixed for packages you have
       installed use:

              yum updateinfo list bugzillas

       To get a list of all security advisories, including the ones you
       have already installed use:

              yum updateinfo list all security

       To get the information on advisory FEDORA-2707-4567 use:

              yum updateinfo info FEDORA-2707-4567

       For Red Hat advisories, respin suffixes are also accepted in the
       ID, although they won't have any effect on the actual respin
       selected by yum, as it will always select the latest one
       available.  For example, if you use:

              yum updateinfo info RHSA-2016:1234-2

       while RHSA-2016:1234-3 has been shipped already, yum will select
       the latter (provided your updateinfo.xml is current).  The same
       would happen if you just specified RHSA-2016:1234.  That said,
       there's no need for you to specify or care about the suffix at
       all.

       To update packages to the latest version which contain fixes for
       Bugzillas 123, 456 and 789; and all security updates use:

              yum --bz 123 --bz 456 --bz 789 --security update

       To update to the packages which just update Bugzillas 123, 456
       and 789; and all security updates use:

              yum --bz 123 --bz 456 --bz 789 --security update-minimal

       To get an info list of the latest packages which contain fixes
       for Bugzilla 123; CVEs CVE-2207-0123 and CVE-2207-3210; and
       Fedora advisories FEDORA-2707-4567 and FEDORA-2707-7654 use:

              yum --bz 123 --cve CVE-2207-0123 --cve CVE-2207-3210
              --advisory FEDORA-2707-4567 --advisory FEDORA-2707-7654
              info updates

       To get a list of packages which are "new".

              yum updateinfo list new

       To get a summary of advisories you haven't installed yet use:

              yum updateinfo summary
</pre> <h2>
PLUGINS </h2>
<pre>
       Yum can be extended through the use of plugins. A plugin is a
       Python ".py" file which is installed in one of the directories
       specified by the <b>pluginpath </b>option in yum.conf. For a plugin to
       work, the following conditions must be met:

       1. The plugin module file must be installed in the plugin path as
       just described.

       2. The global <b>plugins </b>option in /etc/yum/yum.conf must be set to
       `1'.

       3. A configuration file for the plugin must exist in
       /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/&lt;plugin_name&gt;.conf and the <b>enabled </b>setting
       in this file must set to `1'. The minimal content for such a
       configuration file is:

              [main]
              enabled = 1

       See the <a href="../man5/yum.conf.5.html">yum.conf(5)</a> man page for more information on plugin
       related configuration options.
