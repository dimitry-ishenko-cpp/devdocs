DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Proportional Integral controller-Enhanced (PIE) is a control
       theoretic active queue management scheme. It is based on the
       proportional integral controller but aims to control delay. The
       main design goals are
        o Low latency control
        o High link utilization
        o Simple implementation
        o Guaranteed stability and fast responsiveness
</pre> <h2>
ALGORITHM </h2>
<pre>
       PIE is designed to control delay effectively. First, an average
       dequeue rate is estimated based on the standing queue. The rate
       is used to calculate the current delay. Then, on a periodic
       basis, the delay is used to calculate the dropping probability.
       Finally, on arrival, a packet is dropped (or marked) based on
       this probability.

       PIE makes adjustments to the probability based on the trend of
       the delay i.e.  whether it is going up or down.The delay
       converges quickly to the target value specified.

       alpha and beta are statically chosen parameters chosen to control
       the drop probability growth and are determined through control
       theoretic approaches. alpha determines how the deviation between
       the current and target latency changes probability. beta exerts
       additional adjustments depending on the latency trend.

       The drop probability is used to mark packets in ecn mode.
       However, as in RED, beyond 10% packets are dropped based on this
       probability. The bytemode is used to drop packets proportional to
       the packet size.

       Additional details can be found in the paper cited below.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>limit</b>
       limit on the queue size in packets. Incoming packets are dropped
       when this limit is reached. Default is 1000 packets.

   <b>target</b>
       is the expected queue delay. The default target delay is 15ms.

   <b>tupdate</b>
       is the frequency at which the system drop probability is
       calculated. The default is 15ms.

   <b>alpha</b>
   <b>beta</b>
       alpha and beta are parameters chosen to control the drop
       probability. These should be in the range between 0 and 32.

   <b>ecn | noecn</b>
       is used to mark packets instead of dropping.  <b>ecn </b>to turn on ecn
       mode, <b>noecn </b>to turn off ecn mode. By default, <b>ecn </b>is turned off.

   <b>bytemode | nobytemode</b>
       is used to scale drop probability proportional to packet size.
       <b>bytemode </b>to turn on bytemode, <b>nobytemode </b>to turn off bytemode. By
       default, <b>bytemode </b>is turned off.

   <b>dq_rate_estimator | no_dq_rate_estimator</b>
       is used to calculate delay using Little's law.  <b>dq_rate_estimator</b>
       to turn on dq_rate_estimator, <b>no_dq_rate_estimator </b>to turn off
       no_dq_rate_estimator. By default, <b>dq_rate_estimator </b>is turned
       off.
