NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>makemap </b>— create database maps for smtpd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>makemap </b>[<b>-U</b>] [<b>-d </b><i>dbtype</i>] [<b>-o </b><i>dbfile</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>type</i>] <i>file</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Maps provide a generic interface for associating a textual key to
       a value.  Such associations may be accessed through a plaintext
       file, database, or DNS.  The format of these file types is
       described below.  <b>makemap </b>itself creates the database maps used
       by keyed map lookups specified in <i>smtpd.conf</i>(5).

       <b>makemap </b>reads input from <i>file</i> and writes data to a file which is
       named by adding a “.db” suffix to <i>file</i>.  The current line can be
       extended over multiple lines using a backslash (‘\’).  Comments
       can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark (‘#’), and
       extend to the end of the current line.  Care should be taken when
       commenting out multi-line text: the comment is effective until
       the end of the entire block.  In all cases, <b>makemap </b>reads lines
       consisting of words separated by whitespace.  The first word of a
       line is the database key; the remainder represents the mapped
       value.  The database key and value may optionally be separated by
       the colon character.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-d </b><i>dbtype</i>
               Specify the format of the database.  Available formats
               are <i>hash</i> and <i>btree</i>.  The default value is <i>hash</i>.

       <b>-o </b><i>dbfile</i>
               Write the generated database to <i>dbfile</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>type</i>
               Specify the format of the resulting map file.  The
               default map format is suitable for storing simple,
               unstructured, key-to-value string associations.  However,
               if the mapped value has special meaning, as in the case
               of a virtual domains file, a suitable <i>type</i> must be
               provided.  The available output types are:

               <b>aliases  </b>The mapped value is a comma-separated list of
                        mail destinations.  This format can be used for
                        building user aliases and user mappings for
                        virtual domain files.

               <b>set      </b>There is no mapped value – a map of this type
                        will only allow for the lookup of keys.  This
                        format can be used for building primary domain
                        maps.

       <b>-U      </b>Instead of generating a database map from text input,
               dump the contents of a database map as text with the key
               and value separated with a tab.
</pre> <h2>
PRIMARY DOMAINS </h2>
<pre>
       Primary domains can be kept in tables.  To create a primary
       domain table, add each primary domain on a single line by itself.

       In addition to adding an entry to the primary domain map, one
       must add a filter rule that accepts mail for the domain map, for
       example:

             table domains db:/etc/mail/domains.db

             action "local" mbox

             match for domain &lt;domains&gt; action "local"
</pre> <h2>
VIRTUAL DOMAINS </h2>
<pre>
       Virtual domains may also be kept in tables.  To create a virtual
       domain table, add each virtual domain on a single line by itself.

       Virtual domains expect a mapping of virtual users to real users
       in order to determine if a recipient is accepted or not.  The
       mapping format is an extension to <i>aliases</i>(5), which allows the
       use of “user@domain.tld” to accept user only on the specified
       domain, “user” to accept the user for any of the virtual domains,
       “@domain.tld” to provide a catch-all for the specified domain and
       “@” to provide a global catch-all for all domains.  <i>smtpd</i>(8) will
       perform the lookups in that specific order.

       To create a single virtual address, add “user@example.com user”
       to the users map.  To handle all mail destined to any user at
       example.com, add “@example.com user” to the virtual map.

       In addition to adding an entry to the virtual map, one must add a
       filter rule that accepts mail for virtual domains, for example:

             table vdomains db:/etc/mail/vdomains.db
             table vusers db:/etc/mail/users.db

             action "local" mbox virtual &lt;vusers&gt;

             match for domain &lt;vdomains&gt; action "local"
             match for domain "example.org" action "local"
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/mail/aliases</i>     List of user mail aliases.
       <i>/etc/mail/secrets</i>     List of remote host credentials.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>makemap </b>utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error
       occurs.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>makemap </b>command first appeared in OpenBSD 4.6 as a
       replacement for the equivalent command shipped with sendmail.
