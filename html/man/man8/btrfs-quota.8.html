NAME </h2>
<pre>
       btrfs-quota - control the global quota status of a btrfs
       filesystem
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>btrfs quota </b><i>&lt;subcommand&gt; &lt;args&gt;</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The commands under <b>btrfs quota </b>are used to affect the global
       status of quotas of a btrfs filesystem. The quota groups
       (qgroups) are managed by the subcommand <b>btrfs qgroup</b>(8).

           <b>Note</b>

           Qgroups are different than the traditional user quotas and
           designed to track shared and exclusive data per-subvolume.
           Please refer to the section <i>HIERARCHICAL QUOTA GROUP CONCEPTS</i>
           for a detailed description.

   <b>PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS</b>
       When quotas are activated, they affect all extent processing,
       which takes a performance hit. Activation of qgroups is not
       recommended unless the user intends to actually use them.

   <b>STABILITY STATUS</b>
       The qgroup implementation has turned out to be quite difficult as
       it affects the core of the filesystem operation. Qgroup users
       have hit various corner cases over time, such as incorrect
       accounting or system instability. The situation is gradually
       improving and issues found and fixed.
</pre> <h2>
HIERARCHICAL QUOTA GROUP CONCEPTS </h2>
<pre>
       The concept of quota has a long-standing tradition in the Unix
       world. Ever since computers allow multiple users to work
       simultaneously in one filesystem, there is the need to prevent
       one user from using up the entire space. Every user should get
       his fair share of the available resources.

       In case of files, the solution is quite straightforward. Each
       file has an <i>owner</i> recorded along with it, and it has a size.
       Traditional quota just restricts the total size of all files that
       are owned by a user. The concept is quite flexible: if a user
       hits his quota limit, the administrator can raise it on the fly.

       On the other hand, the traditional approach has only a poor
       solution to restrict directories. At installation time, the
       harddisk can be partitioned so that every directory (eg. /usr,
       /var/, ...) that needs a limit gets its own partition. The
       obvious problem is that those limits cannot be changed without a
       reinstallation. The btrfs subvolume feature builds a bridge.
       Subvolumes correspond in many ways to partitions, as every
       subvolume looks like its own filesystem. With subvolume quota, it
       is now possible to restrict each subvolume like a partition, but
       keep the flexibility of quota. The space for each subvolume can
       be expanded or restricted on the fly.

       As subvolumes are the basis for snapshots, interesting questions
       arise as to how to account used space in the presence of
       snapshots. If you have a file shared between a subvolume and a
       snapshot, whom to account the file to? The creator? Both? What if
       the file gets modified in the snapshot, should only these changes
       be accounted to it? But wait, both the snapshot and the subvolume
       belong to the same user home. I just want to limit the total
       space used by both! But somebody else might not want to charge
       the snapshots to the users.

       Btrfs subvolume quota solves these problems by introducing groups
       of subvolumes and let the user put limits on them. It is even
       possible to have groups of groups. In the following, we refer to
       them as <i>qgroups</i>.

       Each qgroup primarily tracks two numbers, the amount of total
       referenced space and the amount of exclusively referenced space.

       referenced
           space is the amount of data that can be reached from any of
           the subvolumes contained in the qgroup, while

       exclusive
           is the amount of data where all references to this data can
           be reached from within this qgroup.

   <b>SUBVOLUME QUOTA GROUPS</b>
       The basic notion of the Subvolume Quota feature is the quota
       group, short qgroup. Qgroups are notated as <i>level/id</i>, eg. the
       qgroup 3/2 is a qgroup of level 3. For level 0, the leading <i>0/</i>
       can be omitted. Qgroups of level 0 get created automatically when
       a subvolume/snapshot gets created. The ID of the qgroup
       corresponds to the ID of the subvolume, so 0/5 is the qgroup for
       the root subvolume. For the <b>btrfs qgroup </b>command, the path to the
       subvolume can also be used instead of <i>0/ID</i>. For all higher
       levels, the ID can be chosen freely.

       Each qgroup can contain a set of lower level qgroups, thus
       creating a hierarchy of qgroups. Figure 1 shows an example qgroup
       tree.

       Figure1: Sample qgroup hierarchy

       At the bottom, some extents are depicted showing which qgroups
       reference which extents. It is important to understand the notion
       of <i>referenced</i> vs <i>exclusive</i>. In the example, qgroup 0/2 references
       extents 2 and 3, while 1/2 references extents 2-4, 2/1 references
       all extents.

       On the other hand, extent 1 is exclusive to 0/1, extent 2 is
       exclusive to 0/2, while extent 3 is neither exclusive to 0/2 nor
       to 0/3. But because both references can be reached from 1/2,
       extent 3 is exclusive to 1/2. All extents are exclusive to 2/1.

       So exclusive does not mean there is no other way to reach the
       extent, but it does mean that if you delete all subvolumes
       contained in a qgroup, the extent will get deleted.

       Exclusive of a qgroup conveys the useful information how much
       space will be freed in case all subvolumes of the qgroup get
       deleted.

       All data extents are accounted this way. Metadata that belongs to
       a specific subvolume (i.e. its filesystem tree) is also
       accounted. Checksums and extent allocation information are not
       accounted.

       In turn, the referenced count of a qgroup can be limited. All
       writes beyond this limit will lead to a <i>Quota Exceeded</i> error.

   <b>INHERITANCE</b>
       Things get a bit more complicated when new subvolumes or
       snapshots are created. The case of (empty) subvolumes is still
       quite easy. If a subvolume should be part of a qgroup, it has to
       be added to the qgroup at creation time. To add it at a later
       time, it would be necessary to at least rescan the full subvolume
       for a proper accounting.

       Creation of a snapshot is the hard case. Obviously, the snapshot
       will reference the exact amount of space as its source, and both
       source and destination now have an exclusive count of 0 (the
       filesystem nodesize to be precise, as the roots of the trees are
       not shared). But what about qgroups of higher levels? If the
       qgroup contains both the source and the destination, nothing
       changes. If the qgroup contains only the source, it might lose
       some exclusive.

       But how much? The tempting answer is, subtract all exclusive of
       the source from the qgroup, but that is wrong, or at least not
       enough. There could have been an extent that is referenced from
       the source and another subvolume from that qgroup. This extent
       would have been exclusive to the qgroup, but not to the source
       subvolume. With the creation of the snapshot, the qgroup would
       also lose this extent from its exclusive set.

       So how can this problem be solved? In the instant the snapshot
       gets created, we already have to know the correct exclusive
       count. We need to have a second qgroup that contains all the
       subvolumes as the first qgroup, except the subvolume we want to
       snapshot. The moment we create the snapshot, the exclusive count
       from the second qgroup needs to be copied to the first qgroup, as
       it represents the correct value. The second qgroup is called a
       tracking qgroup. It is only there in case a snapshot is needed.

   <b>USE CASES</b>
       Below are some usecases that do not mean to be extensive. You can
       find your own way how to integrate qgroups.

       <b>SINGLE-USER MACHINE</b>

           <b>Replacement for partitions</b>

           The simplest use case is to use qgroups as simple replacement
           for partitions. Btrfs takes the disk as a whole, and /, /usr,
           /var, etc. are created as subvolumes. As each subvolume gets
           it own qgroup automatically, they can simply be restricted.
           No hierarchy is needed for that.

           <b>Track usage of snapshots</b>

           When a snapshot is taken, a qgroup for it will automatically
           be created with the correct values. <i>Referenced</i> will show how
           much is in it, possibly shared with other subvolumes.
           <i>Exclusive</i> will be the amount of space that gets freed when
           the subvolume is deleted.

       <b>MULTI-USER MACHINE</b>

           <b>Restricting homes</b>

           When you have several users on a machine, with home
           directories probably under /home, you might want to restrict
           /home as a whole, while restricting every user to an
           individual limit as well. This is easily accomplished by
           creating a qgroup for /home , eg. 1/1, and assigning all user
           subvolumes to it. Restricting this qgroup will limit /home,
           while every user subvolume can get its own (lower) limit.

           <b>Accounting snapshots to the user</b>

           Let’s say the user is allowed to create snapshots via some
           mechanism. It would only be fair to account space used by the
           snapshots to the user. This does not mean the user doubles
           his usage as soon as he takes a snapshot. Of course, files
           that are present in his home and the snapshot should only be
           accounted once. This can be accomplished by creating a qgroup
           for each user, say <i>1/UID</i>. The user home and all snapshots are
           assigned to this qgroup. Limiting it will extend the limit to
           all snapshots, counting files only once. To limit /home as a
           whole, a higher level group 2/1 replacing 1/1 from the
           previous example is needed, with all user qgroups assigned to
           it.

           <b>Do not account snapshots</b>

           On the other hand, when the snapshots get created
           automatically, the user has no chance to control them, so the
           space used by them should not be accounted to him. This is
           already the case when creating snapshots in the example from
           the previous section.

           <b>Snapshots for backup purposes</b>

           This scenario is a mixture of the previous two. The user can
           create snapshots, but some snapshots for backup purposes are
           being created by the system. The user’s snapshots should be
           accounted to the user, not the system. The solution is
           similar to the one from section <i>Accounting snapshots to the</i>
           <i>user</i>, but do not assign system snapshots to user’s qgroup.
