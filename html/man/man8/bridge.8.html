</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-V</b>, <b>-Version</b>
              print the version of the <b>bridge </b>utility and exit.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>-stats</b>, <b>-statistics</b>
              output more information. If this option is given multiple
              times, the amount of information increases.  As a rule,
              the information is statistics or some time values.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>-details</b>
              print detailed information about bridge vlan filter
              entries or MDB router ports.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>-net</b>, <b>-netns </b>&lt;NETNS&gt;
              switches <b>bridge </b>to the specified network namespace <i>NETNS</i>.
              Actually it just simplifies executing of:

              <b>ip netns exec </b><i>NETNS</i> <b>bridge </b>[ <i>OPTIONS</i> ] <i>OBJECT</i> { <i>COMMAND</i> |
              <b>help </b>}

              to

              <b>bridge </b>-n[etns] <i>NETNS</i> [ <i>OPTIONS</i> ] <i>OBJECT</i> { <i>COMMAND</i> | <b>help</b>
              }

       <b>-b</b>, <b>-batch </b>&lt;FILENAME&gt;
              Read commands from provided file or standard input and
              invoke them.  First failure will cause termination of
              bridge command.

       <b>-force </b>Don't terminate bridge command on errors in batch mode.
              If there were any errors during execution of the commands,
              the application return code will be non zero.

       <b>-com</b>, <b>-compressvlans</b>
              Show compressed VLAN list. It will show continuous VLANs
              with the range instead of separated VLANs. Default is off.

       <b>-c</b>[<b>color</b>][<b>=</b>{<b>always</b>|<b>auto</b>|<b>never</b>}
              Configure color output. If parameter is omitted or <b>always</b>,
              color output is enabled regardless of stdout state. If
              parameter is <b>auto</b>, stdout is checked to be a terminal
              before enabling color output. If parameter is <b>never</b>, color
              output is disabled. If specified multiple times, the last
              one takes precedence. This flag is ignored if <b>-json </b>is
              also given.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>-json</b>
              Output results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

       <b>-p</b>, <b>-pretty</b>
              When combined with -j generate a pretty JSON output.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>-oneline</b>
              output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds
              with the <b>'\' </b>character. This is convenient when you want
              to count records with <a href="../man1/wc.1.html">wc(1)</a> or to <a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep(1)</a> the output.

BRIDGE - COMMAND SYNTAX </h2>
<pre>
   <i>OBJECT</i>
       <b>link   </b>- Bridge port.

       <b>fdb    </b>- Forwarding Database entry.

       <b>mdb    </b>- Multicast group database entry.

       <b>vlan   </b>- VLAN filter list.

       <b>vni    </b>- VNI filter list.

   <i>COMMAND</i>
       Specifies the action to perform on the object.  The set of
       possible actions depends on the object type.  As a rule, it is
       possible to <b>add</b>, <b>delete </b>and <b>show </b>(or <b>list </b>) objects, but some
       objects do not allow all of these operations or have some
       additional commands. The <b>help </b>command is available for all
       objects. It prints out a list of available commands and argument
       syntax conventions.

       If no command is given, some default command is assumed.  Usually
       it is <b>list </b>or, if the objects of this class cannot be listed,
       <b>help</b>.
</pre> <h2>
bridge link - bridge port </h2>
<pre>
       <b>link </b>objects correspond to the port devices of the bridge.

       The corresponding commands set and display port status and bridge
       specific attributes.

   <b>bridge link set - set bridge specific attributes on a port</b>
       <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
              interface name of the bridge port

       <b>cost </b><i>COST</i>
              the STP path cost of the specified port.

       <b>priority </b><i>PRIO</i>
              the STP port priority. The priority value is an unsigned
              8-bit quantity (number between 0 and 255). This metric is
              used in the designated port an droot port selection
              algorithms.

       <b>state </b><i>STATE</i>
              the operation state of the port. Except state 0 (disable
              STP or BPDU filter feature), this is primarily used by
              user space STP/RSTP implementation. One may enter port
              state name (case insensitive), or one of the numbers
              below. Negative inputs are ignored, and unrecognized names
              return an error.

              <b>0 </b>- port is in STP <b>DISABLED </b>state. Make this port
              completely inactive for STP. This is also called BPDU
              filter and could be used to disable STP on an untrusted
              port, like a leaf virtual devices.

              <b>1 </b>- port is in STP <b>LISTENING </b>state. Only valid if STP is
              enabled on the bridge. In this state the port listens for
              STP BPDUs and drops all other traffic frames.

              <b>2 </b>- port is in STP <b>LEARNING </b>state. Only valid if STP is
              enabled on the bridge. In this state the port will accept
              traffic only for the purpose of updating MAC address
              tables.

              <b>3 </b>- port is in STP <b>FORWARDING </b>state. Port is fully active.

              <b>4 </b>- port is in STP <b>BLOCKING </b>state. Only valid if STP is
              enabled on the bridge. This state is used during the STP
              election process. In this state, port will only process
              STP BPDUs.

       <b>guard on </b>or <b>guard off</b>
              Controls whether STP BPDUs will be processed by the bridge
              port. By default, the flag is turned off allowed BPDU
              processing. Turning this flag on will disables the bridge
              port if a STP BPDU packet is received.

              If running Spanning Tree on bridge, hostile devices on the
              network may send BPDU on a port and cause network failure.
              Setting <b>guard on </b>will detect and stop this by disabling
              the port.  The port will be restarted if link is brought
              down, or removed and reattached.  For example if guard is
              enable on eth0:

              <b>ip link set dev eth0 down; ip link set dev eth0 up</b>

       <b>hairpin on </b>or <b>hairpin off</b>
              Controls whether traffic may be send back out of the port
              on which it was received. This option is also called
              reflective relay mode, and is used to support basic VEPA
              (Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator) capabilities.  By
              default, this flag is turned off and the bridge will not
              forward traffic back out of the receiving port.

       <b>fastleave on </b>or <b>fastleave off</b>
              This flag allows the bridge to immediately stop multicast
              traffic on a port that receives IGMP Leave message. It is
              only used with IGMP snooping is enabled on the bridge. By
              default the flag is off.

       <b>root_block on </b>or <b>root_block off</b>
              Controls whether a given port is allowed to become root
              port or not. Only used when STP is enabled on the bridge.
              By default the flag is off.

              This feature is also called root port guard.  If BPDU is
              received from a leaf (edge) port, it should not be elected
              as root port. This could be used if using STP on a bridge
              and the downstream bridges are not fully trusted; this
              prevents a hostile guest from rerouting traffic.

       <b>learning on </b>or <b>learning off</b>
              Controls whether a given port will learn MAC addresses
              from received traffic or not. If learning if off, the
              bridge will end up flooding any traffic for which it has
              no FDB entry. By default this flag is on.

       <b>learning_sync on </b>or <b>learning_sync off</b>
              Controls whether a given port will sync MAC addresses
              learned on device port to bridge FDB.

       <b>flood on </b>or <b>flood off</b>
              Controls whether unicast traffic for which there is no FDB
              entry will be flooded towards this given port. By default
              this flag is on.

       <b>hwmode </b>Some network interface cards support HW bridge
              functionality and they may be configured in different
              modes. Currently support modes are:

              <b>vepa </b>- Data sent between HW ports is sent on the wire to
              the external switch.

              <b>veb </b>- bridging happens in hardware.

       <b>bcast_flood on </b>or <b>bcast_flood off</b>
              Controls flooding of broadcast traffic on the given port.
              By default this flag is on.

       <b>mcast_flood on </b>or <b>mcast_flood off</b>
              Controls whether multicast traffic for which there is no
              MDB entry will be flooded towards this given port. By
              default this flag is on.

       <b>mcast_max_groups </b><i>MAX_GROUPS</i>
              Sets the maximum number of MDB entries that can be
              registered for a given port. Attempts to register more MDB
              entries at the port than this limit allows will be
              rejected, whether they are done through netlink (e.g. the
              <b>bridge </b>tool), or IGMP or MLD membership reports. Setting a
              limit to 0 has the effect of disabling the limit. The
              default value is 0. See also the <b>ip link </b>option
              <b>mcast_hash_max</b>.

       <b>mcast_router </b><i>MULTICAST_ROUTER</i>
              This flag is almost the same as the per-VLAN flag, see
              below, except its value can only be set in the range 0-2.
              The default is <b>1 </b>where the bridge figures out
              automatically where an IGMP/MLD querier, MRDISC capable
              device, or PIM router, is located.  Setting this flag to <b>2</b>
              is useful in cases where the multicast router does not
              indicate its presence in any meaningful way (e.g. older
              versions of SMCRoute, or mrouted), or when there is a need
              for forwarding both known and unknown IP multicast to a
              secondary/backup router.

       <b>mcast_to_unicast on </b>or <b>mcast_to_unicast off</b>
              Controls whether a given port will replicate packets using
              unicast instead of multicast. By default this flag is off.

              This is done by copying the packet per host and changing
              the multicast destination MAC to a unicast one
              accordingly.

              <b>mcast_to_unicast </b>works on top of the multicast snooping
              feature of the bridge. Which means unicast copies are only
              delivered to hosts which are interested in it and
              signalized this via IGMP/MLD reports previously.

              This feature is intended for interface types which have a
              more reliable and/or efficient way to deliver unicast
              packets than broadcast ones (e.g. WiFi).

              However, it should only be enabled on interfaces where no
              IGMPv2/MLDv1 report suppression takes place. IGMP/MLD
              report suppression issue is usually overcome by the
              network daemon (supplicant) enabling AP isolation and by
              that separating all STAs.

              Delivery of STA-to-STA IP multicast is made possible again
              by enabling and utilizing the bridge hairpin mode, which
              considers the incoming port as a potential outgoing port,
              too (see <b>hairpin </b>option).  Hairpin mode is performed after
              multicast snooping, therefore leading to only deliver
              reports to STAs running a multicast router.

       <b>neigh_suppress on </b>or <b>neigh_suppress off</b>
              Controls whether neigh discovery (arp and nd) proxy and
              suppression is enabled on the port. By default this flag
              is off.

       <b>neigh_vlan_suppress on </b>or <b>neigh_vlan_suppress off</b>
              Controls whether per-VLAN neigh discovery (arp and nd)
              proxy and suppression is enabled on the port. When on, the
              <b>bridge link </b>option <b>neigh_suppress </b>has no effect and the
              per-VLAN state is set using the <b>bridge vlan </b>option
              <b>neigh_suppress</b>. By default this flag is off.

       <b>vlan_tunnel on </b>or <b>vlan_tunnel off</b>
              Controls whether vlan to tunnel mapping is enabled on the
              port. By default this flag is off.

       <b>isolated on </b>or <b>isolated off</b>
              Controls whether a given port will be isolated, which
              means it will be able to communicate with non-isolated
              ports only.  By default this flag is off.

       <b>locked on </b>or <b>locked off</b>
              Controls whether a port is locked or not. When locked,
              non-link-local frames received through the port are
              dropped unless an FDB entry with the MAC source address
              points to the port. The common use case is IEEE 802.1X
              where hosts can authenticate themselves by exchanging
              EAPOL frames with an authenticator. After authentication
              is complete, the user space control plane can install a
              matching FDB entry to allow traffic from the host to be
              forwarded by the bridge. When learning is enabled on a
              locked port, the <b>no_linklocal_learn </b>bridge option needs to
              be on to prevent the bridge from learning from received
              EAPOL frames. By default this flag is off.

       <b>mab on </b>or <b>mab off</b>
              Controls whether MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) is
              enabled on the port or not.  MAB can only be enabled on a
              locked port that has learning enabled. When enabled, FDB
              entries are learned from received traffic and have the
              "locked" FDB flag set. The flag can only be set by the
              kernel and it indicates that the FDB entry cannot be used
              to authenticate the corresponding host. User space can
              decide to authenticate the host by replacing the FDB entry
              and clearing the "locked" FDB flag. Locked FDB entries can
              roam to unlocked (authorized) ports in which case the
              "locked" flag is cleared. FDB entries cannot roam to
              locked ports regardless of MAB being enabled or not.
              Therefore, locked FDB entries are only created if an FDB
              entry with the given {MAC, VID} does not already exist.
              This behavior prevents unauthenticated hosts from
              disrupting traffic destined to already authenticated
              hosts. Locked FDB entries act like regular dynamic entries
              with respect to forwarding and aging. By default this flag
              is off.

       <b>backup_port </b><i>DEVICE</i>

              tunnel mapping enabled (via the <b>vlan_tunnel </b>option).
              Setting a value of 0 (default) has the effect of not
              attaching any ID.

bridge fdb - forwarding database management </h2>
<pre>
       <b>fdb </b>objects contain known Ethernet addresses on a link.

       The corresponding commands display fdb entries, add new entries,
       append entries, and delete old ones.

   <b>bridge fdb add - add a new fdb entry</b>
       This command creates a new fdb entry.

       <b>LLADDR </b>the Ethernet MAC address.

       <b>dev </b><i>DEV</i>
              the interface to which this address is associated.

              <b>local </b>- is a local permanent fdb entry, which means that
              the bridge will not forward frames with this destination
              MAC address and VLAN ID, but terminate them locally. This
              flag is default unless "static" or "dynamic" are
              explicitly specified.

              <b>permanent </b>- this is a synonym for "local"

              <b>static </b>- is a static (no arp) fdb entry

              <b>dynamic </b>- is a dynamic reachable age-able fdb entry

              <b>self </b>- the operation is fulfilled directly by the driver
              for the specified network device. If the network device
              belongs to a master like a bridge, then the bridge is
              bypassed and not notified of this operation (and if the
              device does notify the bridge, it is driver-specific
              behavior and not mandated by this flag, check the driver
              for more details). The "bridge fdb add" command can also
              be used on the bridge device itself, and in this case, the
              added fdb entries will be locally terminated (not
              forwarded). In the latter case, the "self" flag is
              mandatory. The flag is set by default if "master" is not
              specified.

              <b>master </b>- if the specified network device is a port that
              belongs to a master device such as a bridge, the operation
              is fulfilled by the master device's driver, which may in
              turn notify the port driver too of the address. If the
              specified device is a master itself, such as a bridge,
              this flag is invalid.

              <b>router </b>- the destination address is associated with a
              router.  Valid if the referenced device is a VXLAN type
              device and has route short circuit enabled.

              <b>use </b>- the address is in use. User space can use this
              option to indicate to the kernel that the fdb entry is in
              use.

              <b>extern_learn </b>- this entry was learned externally. This
              option can be used to indicate to the kernel that an entry
              was hardware or user-space controller learnt dynamic
              entry. Kernel will not age such an entry.

              <b>sticky </b>- this entry will not change its port due to
              learning.

      The next command line parameters apply only when the specified

              be used.

       <b>port </b><i>PORT</i>
              the UDP destination PORT number to use to connect to the

       This command adds a new fdb entry with an already known <i>LLADDR</i>.
       Valid only for multicast link layer addresses.  The command adds
       support for broadcast and multicast Ethernet MAC addresses.  The

bridge vlan - VLAN filter list </h2>
<pre>
       <b>vlan </b>objects contain known VLAN IDs for a link.

       The corresponding commands display vlan filter entries, add new
       entries, and delete old ones.

   <b>bridge vlan add - add a new vlan filter entry</b>
       This command creates a new vlan filter entry.

       <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
              the interface with which this vlan is associated.

       <b>vid </b><i>VID</i>
              the VLAN ID that identifies the vlan.

       <b>tunnel_info </b><i>TUNNEL_ID</i>
              the TUNNEL ID that maps to this vlan. The tunnel id is set
              in dst_metadata for every packet that belongs to this vlan
              (applicable to bridge ports with vlan_tunnel flag set).

       <b>pvid   </b>the vlan specified is to be considered a PVID at ingress.
              Any untagged frames will be assigned to this VLAN.

       <b>untagged</b>
              the vlan specified is to be treated as untagged on egress.

       <b>self   </b>the vlan is configured on the specified physical device.
              Required if the device is the bridge device.

       <b>master </b>the vlan is configured on the software bridge (default).

   <b>bridge vlan delete - delete a vlan filter entry</b>
       This command removes an existing vlan filter entry.

       The arguments are the same as with <b>bridge vlan add</b>.  The <b>pvid </b>and
       <b>untagged </b>flags are ignored.

   <b>bridge vlan set - change vlan filter entry's options</b>
       This command changes vlan filter entry's options.

       <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
              the interface with which this vlan is associated.

       <b>vid </b><i>VID</i>
              the VLAN ID that identifies the vlan.

       <b>state </b><i>STP_STATE</i>
              the operation state of the vlan. One may enter STP state
              name (case insensitive), or one of the numbers below.
              Negative inputs are ignored, and unrecognized names return
              an error. Note that the state is set only for the vlan of
              the specified device, e.g. if it is a bridge port then the
              state will be set only for the vlan of the port.

              <b>0 </b>- vlan is in STP <b>DISABLED </b>state. Make this vlan
              completely inactive for STP. This is also called BPDU
              filter and could be used to disable STP on an untrusted
              vlan.

              <b>1 </b>- vlan is in STP <b>LISTENING </b>state. Only valid if STP is
              enabled on the bridge. In this state the vlan listens for
              STP BPDUs and drops all other traffic frames.

              <b>2 </b>- vlan is in STP <b>LEARNING </b>state. Only valid if STP is
              enabled on the bridge. In this state the vlan will accept
              traffic only for the purpose of updating MAC address
              tables.

              <b>3 </b>- vlan is in STP <b>FORWARDING </b>state. This is the default
              vlan state.

              <b>4 </b>- vlan is in STP <b>BLOCKING </b>state. Only valid if STP is
              enabled on the bridge. This state is used during the STP
              election process. In this state, the vlan will only
              process STP BPDUs.

       <b>mcast_max_groups </b><i>MAX_GROUPS</i>
              Sets the maximum number of MDB entries that can be
              registered for a given VLAN on a given port. A VLAN-
              specific equivalent of the per-port option of the same
              name, see above for details.

              Note that this option is only available when <b>ip link</b>
              option <b>mcast_vlan_snooping </b>is enabled.

       <b>mcast_router </b><i>MULTICAST_ROUTER</i>
              configure this vlan and interface's multicast router mode,
              note that only modes 0 - 2 are available for bridge
              devices.  A vlan and interface with a multicast router
              will receive all multicast traffic.  <i>MULTICAST_ROUTER</i> may
              be either

              <b>0 </b>- to disable multicast router.

              <b>1 </b>- to let the system detect the presence of routers
              (default).

              <b>2 </b>- to permanently enable multicast traffic forwarding on
              this vlan and interface.

              <b>3 </b>- to temporarily mark this vlan and port as having a
              multicast router, i.e.  enable multicast traffic
              forwarding. This mode is available only for ports.

       <b>neigh_suppress on </b>or <b>neigh_suppress off</b>
              Controls whether neigh discovery (arp and nd) proxy and
              suppression is enabled for a given VLAN on a given port.
              By default this flag is off.

              Note that this option only takes effect when <b>bridge link</b>
              option <b>neigh_vlan_suppress </b>is enabled for a given port.

   <b>bridge vlan show - list vlan configuration.</b>
       This command displays the current VLAN filter table.

       traffic statistics.

   <b>bridge vlan tunnelshow - list vlan tunnel mapping.</b>
       This command displays the current vlan tunnel info mapping.

   <b>bridge vlan global set - change vlan filter entry's global options</b>
       This command changes vlan filter entry's global options.

       <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
              the interface with which this vlan is associated. Only
              bridge devices are supported for global options.

       <b>vid </b><i>VID</i>
              the VLAN ID that identifies the vlan.

       <b>mcast_snooping </b><i>MULTICAST_SNOOPING</i>
              turn multicast snooping for VLAN entry with VLAN ID on
              (<i>MULTICAST_SNOOPING</i> &gt; 0) or off (<i>MULTICAST_SNOOPING</i> == 0).
              Default is on.

       <b>mcast_querier </b><i>MULTICAST_QUERIER</i>
              enable (<i>MULTICAST_QUERIER</i> &gt; 0) or disable
              (<i>MULTICAST_QUERIER</i> == 0) IGMP/MLD querier, ie sending of
              multicast queries by the bridge. Default is disabled.

              the bridge will send before stopping forwarding a
              multicast group after a "leave" message has been received.
              Default is 2.

       <b>mcast_last_member_interval </b><i>LAST_MEMBER_INTERVAL</i>
              interval between queries to find remaining members of a
              group, after a "leave" message is received.

       <b>mcast_startup_query_count </b><i>STARTUP_QUERY_COUNT</i>
              set the number of queries to send during startup phase.
              Default is 2.

       <b>mcast_startup_query_interval </b><i>STARTUP_QUERY_INTERVAL</i>

              membership reports for this group are received.

       <b>mcast_querier_interval </b><i>QUERIER_INTERVAL</i>
              interval between queries sent by other routers. If no
              queries are seen after this delay has passed, the bridge
              will start to send its own queries (as if <b>mcast_querier</b>
              was enabled).

       <b>mcast_query_interval </b><i>QUERY_INTERVAL</i>

</pre> <h2>
bridge vni - VNI filter list </h2>
<pre>
       <b>vni </b>objects contain known VNI IDs for a dst metadata vxlan link.

       The corresponding commands display vni filter entries, add new
       entries, and delete old ones.

   <b>bridge vni add - add a new vni filter entry</b>
       This command creates a new vni filter entry.

       <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
              the interface with which this vni is associated.

       <b>vni </b><i>VNI</i>
              the VNI ID that identifies the vni.

       <b>remote </b><i>IPADDR</i>
              specifies the unicast destination IP address to use in
              outgoing packets when the destination link layer address
              is not known in the VXLAN device forwarding database. This
              parameter cannot be specified with the group.

       <b>group </b><i>IPADDR</i>
              specifies the multicast IP address to join for this VNI

   <b>bridge vni del - delete a new vni filter entry</b>
       This command removes an existing vni filter entry.

       The arguments are the same as with <b>bridge vni add</b>.

   <b>bridge vni show - list vni filtering configuration.</b>
       This command displays the current vni filter table.

       With the <b>-statistics </b>option, the command displays per-vni traffic
       statistics.

       <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
              shows vni filtering table associated with the vxlan device
</pre> <h2>
bridge monitor - state monitoring </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>bridge </b>utility can monitor the state of devices and addresses
       continuously. This option has a slightly different format.
       Namely, the <b>monitor </b>command is the first in the command line and
       then the object list follows:

       <b>bridge monitor </b>[ <b>all </b>| <i>OBJECT-LIST</i> ]

       <i>OBJECT-LIST</i> is the list of object types that we want to monitor.
       It may contain <b>link</b>, <b>fdb</b>, <b>vlan </b>and <b>mdb</b>.  If no <b>file </b>argument is
       given, <b>bridge </b>opens RTNETLINK, listens on it and dumps state
       changes in the format described in previous sections.

       If a file name is given, it does not listen on RTNETLINK, but
       opens the file containing RTNETLINK messages saved in binary
       format and dumps them.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       This command uses facilities added in Linux 3.0.

       Although the forwarding table is maintained on a per-bridge
       device basis the bridge device is not part of the syntax. This is
       a limitation of the underlying netlink neighbour message
       protocol. When displaying the forwarding table, entries for all
       bridges are displayed.  Add/delete/modify commands determine the
       underlying bridge device based on the bridge to which the
       corresponding ethernet device is attached.
