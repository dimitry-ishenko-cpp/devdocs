DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>ip l2tp </b>commands are used to establish static, or so-called
       <i>unmanaged</i> L2TPv3 ethernet tunnels. For unmanaged tunnels, there
       is no L2TP control protocol so no userspace daemon is required -
       tunnels are manually created by issuing commands at a local
       system and at a remote peer.

       L2TPv3 is suitable for Layer-2 tunneling. Static tunnels are
       useful to establish network links across IP networks when the
       tunnels are fixed. L2TPv3 tunnels can carry data of more than one
       session. Each session is identified by a session_id and its
       parent tunnel's tunnel_id. A tunnel must be created before a
       session can be created in the tunnel.

       When creating an L2TP tunnel, the IP address of the remote peer
       is specified, which can be either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. The
       local IP address to be used to reach the peer must also be
       specified. This is the address on which the local system will
       listen for and accept received L2TP data packets from the peer.

       L2TPv3 defines two packet encapsulation formats: UDP or IP. UDP
       encapsulation is most common. IP encapsulation uses a dedicated
       IP protocol value to carry L2TP data without the overhead of UDP.
       Use IP encapsulation only when there are no NAT devices or
       firewalls in the network path.

       When an L2TPv3 ethernet session is created, a virtual network
       interface is created for the session, which must then be
       configured and brought up, just like any other network interface.
       When data is passed through the interface, it is carried over the
       L2TP tunnel to the peer. By configuring the system's routing
       tables or adding the interface to a bridge, the L2TP interface is
       like a virtual wire (pseudowire) connected to the peer.

       Establishing an unmanaged L2TPv3 ethernet pseudowire involves
       manually creating L2TP contexts on the local system and at the
       peer. Parameters used at each site must correspond or no data
       will be passed. No consistency checks are possible since there is
       no control protocol used to establish unmanaged L2TP tunnels.
       Once the virtual network interface of a given L2TP session is
       configured and enabled, data can be transmitted, even if the peer
       isn't yet configured. If the peer isn't configured, the L2TP data
       packets will be discarded by the peer.

       To establish an unmanaged L2TP tunnel, use <b>l2tp add tunnel </b>and
       <b>l2tp add session </b>commands described in this document. Then
       configure and enable the tunnel's virtual network interface, as
       required.

       Note that unmanaged tunnels carry only ethernet frames. If you
       need to carry PPP traffic (L2TPv2) or your peer doesn't support
       unmanaged L2TPv3 tunnels, you will need an L2TP server which
       implements the L2TP control protocol. The L2TP control protocol
       allows dynamic L2TP tunnels and sessions to be established and
       provides for detecting and acting upon network failures.

   <b>ip l2tp add tunnel - add a new tunnel</b>
       <b>tunnel_id </b><i>ID</i>

   <b>ip l2tp show tunnel - show information about tunnels</b>
       <b>tunnel_id </b><i>ID</i>
              set the tunnel id of the tunnel to be shown. If not

              Uniquely identifies the tunnel into which the session will
              be created. The tunnel must already exist.

       <b>session_id </b><i>ID</i>

              system what cookie value to expect to find in received
              L2TP packets. Default is to use no cookie.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Setup L2TP tunnels and sessions</b>
       site-A:# ip l2tp add tunnel tunnel_id 3000 peer_tunnel_id 4000 \
                  encap udp local 1.2.3.4 remote 5.6.7.8 \
                  udp_sport 5000 udp_dport 6000
       site-A:# ip l2tp add session tunnel_id 3000 session_id 1000 \
                  peer_session_id 2000

       site-B:# ip l2tp add tunnel tunnel_id 4000 peer_tunnel_id 3000 \
                  encap udp local 5.6.7.8 remote 1.2.3.4 \
                  udp_sport 6000 udp_dport 5000
       site-B:# ip l2tp add session tunnel_id 4000 session_id 2000 \
                  peer_session_id 1000

       site-A:# ip link set l2tpeth0 up mtu 1488

       site-B:# ip link set l2tpeth0 up mtu 1488

       Notice that the IP addresses, UDP ports and tunnel / session ids
       are matched and reversed at each site.

   <b>Configure as IP interfaces</b>
       The two interfaces can be configured with IP addresses if only IP
       data is to be carried. This is perhaps the simplest
       configuration.

       site-A:# ip addr add 10.42.1.1 peer 10.42.1.2 dev l2tpeth0

       site-B:# ip addr add 10.42.1.2 peer 10.42.1.1 dev l2tpeth0

       site-A:# ping 10.42.1.2

       Now the link should be usable. Add static routes as needed to
       have data sent over the new link.

   <b>Configure as bridged interfaces</b>
       To carry non-IP data, the L2TP network interface is added to a
       bridge instead of being assigned its own IP address, using
       standard Linux utilities. Since raw ethernet frames are then
       carried inside the tunnel, the MTU of the L2TP interfaces must be
       set to allow space for those headers.

       site-A:# ip link set l2tpeth0 up mtu 1446
       site-A:# ip link add br0 type bridge
       site-A:# ip link set l2tpeth0 master br0
       site-A:# ip link set eth0 master br0
       site-A:# ip link set br0 up

       If you are using VLANs, setup a bridge per VLAN and bridge each
       VLAN over a separate L2TP session. For example, to bridge VLAN ID
       5 on eth1 over an L2TP pseudowire:

       site-A:# ip link set l2tpeth0 up mtu 1446
       site-A:# ip link add brvlan5 type bridge
       site-A:# ip link set l2tpeth0.5 master brvlan5
       site-A:# ip link set eth1.5 master brvlan5
       site-A:# ip link set brvlan5 up

       Adding the L2TP interface to a bridge causes the bridge to
       forward traffic over the L2TP pseudowire just like it forwards
       over any other interface. The bridge learns MAC addresses of
       hosts attached to each interface and intelligently forwards
       frames from one bridge port to another. IP addresses are not
       assigned to the l2tpethN interfaces. If the bridge is correctly
       configured at both sides of the L2TP pseudowire, it should be
       possible to reach hosts in the peer's bridged network.

       When raw ethernet frames are bridged across an L2TP tunnel, large
       frames may be fragmented and forwarded as individual IP fragments
       to the recipient, depending on the MTU of the physical interface
       used by the tunnel. When the ethernet frames carry protocols
       which are reassembled by the recipient, like IP, this isn't a
       problem. However, such fragmentation can cause problems for
       protocols like PPPoE where the recipient expects to receive
       ethernet frames exactly as transmitted. In such cases, it is
       important that frames leaving the tunnel are reassembled back
       into a single frame before being forwarded on. To do so, enable
       netfilter connection tracking (conntrack) or manually load the
       Linux netfilter defrag modules at each tunnel endpoint.

       site-A:# modprobe nf_defrag_ipv4

       site-B:# modprobe nf_defrag_ipv4

       If L2TP is being used over IPv6, use the IPv6 defrag module.
</pre> <h2>
INTEROPERABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       Unmanaged (static) L2TPv3 tunnels are supported by some network
       equipment vendors such as Cisco.

       In Linux, L2TP Hello messages are not supported in unmanaged
       tunnels. Hello messages are used by L2TP clients and servers to
       detect link failures in order to automate tearing down and
       reestablishing dynamic tunnels. If a non-Linux peer supports
       Hello messages in unmanaged tunnels, it must be turned off to
       interoperate with Linux.

       Linux defaults to use the Default Layer2SpecificHeader type as
       defined in the L2TPv3 protocol specification, RFC3931. This
       setting must be consistent with that configured at the peer. Some
       vendor implementations (e.g. Cisco) default to use a
       Layer2SpecificHeader type of None.
