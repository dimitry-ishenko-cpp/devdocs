NAME </h2>
<pre>
       xtables-monitor — show changes to rule set and trace-events
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xtables-monitor </b>[<b>-t</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-4</b>|<b>|-6]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xtables-monitor </b>is used to monitor changes to the ruleset or to
       show rule evaluation events for packets tagged using the TRACE
       target.  <b>xtables-monitor </b>will run until the user aborts
       execution, typically by using CTRL-C.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-e</b>, <b>--event</b>

       Watch for updates to the rule set.
              Updates include creation of new tables, chains and rules
              and the name of the program that caused the rule update.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--trace</b>
              Watch for trace events generated by packets that have been
              tagged using the TRACE target.

       <b>-4     </b>Restrict output to IPv4.

       <b>-6     </b>Restrict output to IPv6.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xtables-monitor --trace</b>

               1 TRACE: 2 fc475095 raw:PREROUTING:rule:0x3:CONTINUE -4
              -t raw -A PREROUTING -p icmp -j TRACE
               2 PACKET: 0 fc475095 IN=lo LL=0x304
              0000000000000000000000000800 SRC=127.0.0.1 DST=127.0.0.1
              LEN=84 TOS=0x0 TTL=64 ID=38349DF
               3 TRACE: 2 fc475095 raw:PREROUTING:return:
               4 TRACE: 2 fc475095 raw:PREROUTING:policy:ACCEPT
               5 TRACE: 2 fc475095 filter:INPUT:return:
               6 TRACE: 2 fc475095 filter:INPUT:policy:DROP
               7 TRACE: 2 0df9d3d8 raw:PREROUTING:rule:0x3:CONTINUE -4
              -t raw -A PREROUTING -p icmp -j TRACE

       The first line shows a packet entering rule set evaluation.  The
       protocol number is shown (AF_INET in this case), then a packet
       identifier number that allows one to correlate messages coming
       from rule set evaluation of this packet.  After this, the rule
       that was matched by the packet is shown.  This is the TRACE rule
       that turns on tracing events for this packet.

       The second line dumps information about the packet. Incoming
       interface and packet headers such as source and destination
       addresses are shown.

       The third line shows that the packet completed traversal of the
       raw table PREROUTING chain, and is returning, followed by use of
       the chain policy to make accept/drop decision (the example shows
       accept being applied).  The fifth line shows that the packet
       leaves the filter INPUT chain, i.e., no rules in the filter
       table's INPUT chain matched the packet.  It then got DROPPED by
       the policy of the INPUT table, as shown by line six.  The last
       line shows another packet arriving -- the packet id is different.

       When using the TRACE target, it is usually a good idea to only
       select packets that are relevant, for example via
       iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 --syn -m limit --limit 1/s -j TRACE

       This example shows event monitoring.  Line one shows creation of
       a table (filter in this case), followed by three base hooks
       INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT.  The iptables-nftables tools all
       create tables and base chains automatically when needed, so this
       is expected when a table was not yet initialized or when it is
       re-created from scratch by iptables-nftables-restore.  Line five
       shows a new user-defined chain (TCP) being added, followed by
       addition a few rules. the last line shows that a new ruleset
       generation has become active, i.e., the rule set changes are now
       active.  This also lists the process id and the program name.

LIMITATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xtables-monitor </b>only works with rules added using iptables-
       nftables, rules added using iptables-legacy cannot be monitored.
