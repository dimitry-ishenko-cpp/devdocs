NAME </h2>
<pre>
       nss-myhostname, libnss_myhostname.so.2 - Hostname resolution for
       the locally configured system hostname
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       libnss_myhostname.so.2
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>nss-myhostname </b>is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service
       Switch (NSS) functionality of the GNU C Library (<b>glibc</b>),
       primarily providing hostname resolution for the locally
       configured system hostname as returned by <a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname(2)</a>. The
       precise hostnames resolved by this module are:

       •   The local, configured hostname is resolved to all locally
           configured IP addresses ordered by their scope, or — if none
           are configured — the IPv4 address 127.0.0.2 (which is on the
           local loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local
           host).

       •   The hostnames "localhost" and "localhost.localdomain" (as
           well as any hostname ending in ".localhost" or
           ".localhost.localdomain") are resolved to the IP addresses
           127.0.0.1 and ::1.

       •   The hostname "_gateway" is resolved to all current default
           routing gateway addresses, ordered by their metric. This
           assigns a stable hostname to the current gateway, useful for
           referencing it independently of the current network
           configuration state.

       •   The hostname "_outbound" is resolved to the local IPv4 and
           IPv6 addresses that are most likely used for communication
           with other hosts. This is determined by requesting a routing
           decision to the configured default gateways from the kernel
           and then using the local IP addresses selected by this
           decision. This hostname is only available if there is at
           least one local default gateway configured. This assigns a
           stable hostname to the local outbound IP addresses, useful
           for referencing them independently of the current network
           configuration state.

       Various software relies on an always-resolvable local hostname.
       When using dynamic hostnames, this is traditionally achieved by
       patching /etc/hosts at the same time as changing the hostname.
       This is problematic since it requires a writable /etc/ file
       system and is fragile because the file might be edited by the
       administrator at the same time. With <b>nss-myhostname </b>enabled,
       changing /etc/hosts is unnecessary, and on many systems, the file
       becomes entirely optional.

       To activate the NSS modules, add "myhostname" to the line
       starting with "hosts:" in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

       It is recommended to place "myhostname" after "file" and before
       "dns". This resolves well-known hostnames like "localhost" and
       the machine hostnames locally. It is consistent with the
       behaviour of <b>nss-resolve</b>, and still allows overriding via
       /etc/hosts.

       Please keep in mind that <b>nss-myhostname </b>(and <b>nss-resolve</b>) also
       resolve in the other direction — from locally attached IP
       addresses to hostnames. If you rely on that lookup being provided
       by DNS, you might want to order things differently.

EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       Here is an example /etc/nsswitch.conf file that enables
       <b>nss-myhostname </b>correctly:

           passwd:         files systemd
           group:          files [SUCCESS=merge] systemd
           shadow:         files systemd
           gshadow:        files systemd

           hosts:          mymachines resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] files <b>myhostname </b>dns
           networks:       files

           protocols:      db files
           services:       db files
           ethers:         db files
           rpc:            db files

           netgroup:       nis

       To test, use <b>glibc</b>'s <a href="../man1/getent.1.html">getent(1)</a> tool:

           $ getent ahosts `hostname`
           ::1       STREAM omega
           ::1       DGRAM
           ::1       RAW
           127.0.0.2       STREAM
           127.0.0.2       DGRAM
           127.0.0.2       RAW

       In this case, the local hostname is <i>omega</i>.
