NAME </h2>
<pre>
       debugfs - ext2/ext3/ext4 file system debugger
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debugfs </b>[ <b>-DVwcin </b>] [ <b>-b </b>blocksize ] [ <b>-s </b>superblock ] [ <b>-f</b>
       cmd_file ] [ <b>-R </b>request ] [ <b>-d </b>data_source_device ] [ <b>-z</b>
       <i>undo_file</i> ] [ device ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>debugfs </b>program is an interactive file system debugger. It
       can be used to examine and change the state of an ext2, ext3, or
       ext4 file system.

       <i>device</i> is a block device (e.g., /dev/sdXX) or a file containing
       the file system.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>-w</i>     Specifies that the file system should be opened in read-
              write mode.  Without this option, the file system is
              opened in read-only mode.

       <i>-n</i>     Disables metadata checksum verification.  This should only
              be used if you believe the metadata to be correct despite
              the complaints of e2fsprogs.

       <i>-c</i>     Specifies that the file system should be opened in
              catastrophic mode, in which the inode and group bitmaps
              are not read initially.  This can be useful for file
              systems with significant corruption, but because of this,
              catastrophic mode forces the file system to be opened
              read-only.

       <i>-i</i>     Specifies that <i>device</i> represents an ext2 image file
              created by the <b>e2image </b>program.  Since the ext2 image file
              only contains the superblock, block group descriptor,
              block and inode allocation bitmaps, and the inode table,
              many <b>debugfs </b>commands will not function properly.
              <b>Warning: </b>no safety checks are in place, and <b>debugfs </b>may
              fail in interesting ways if commands such as <i>ls</i>, <i>dump</i>,
              etc. are tried without specifying the <i>data_source_device</i>
              using the <i>-d</i> option.  <b>debugfs </b>is a debugging tool.  It has
              rough edges!

       <i>-d data_source_device</i>
              Used with the <i>-i</i> option, specifies that <i>data_source_device</i>
              should be used when reading blocks not found in the ext2
              image file.  This includes data, directory, and indirect
              blocks.

       <i>-b blocksize</i>
              Forces the use of the given block size (in bytes) for the
              file system, rather than detecting the correct block size
              automatically.  (This option is rarely needed; it is used
              primarily when the file system is extremely badly
              damaged/corrupted.)

       <i>-s superblock</i>
              Causes the file system superblock to be read from the
              given block number, instead of using the primary
              superblock (located at an offset of 1024 bytes from the
              beginning of the file system).  If you specify the <i>-s</i>
              option, you must also provide the blocksize of the file
              system via the <i>-b</i> option.   (This option is rarely needed;
              it is used primarily when the file system is extremely
              badly damaged/corrupted.)

       <i>-f cmd_file</i>
              Causes <b>debugfs </b>to read in commands from <i>cmd_file</i>, and
              execute them.  When <b>debugfs </b>is finished executing those
              commands, it will exit.

       <i>-D</i>     Causes <b>debugfs </b>to open the device using Direct I/O,
              bypassing the buffer cache.  Note that some Linux devices,
              notably device mapper as of this writing, do not support
              Direct I/O.

       <i>-R request</i>
              Causes <b>debugfs </b>to execute the single command <i>request</i>, and
              then exit.

       <i>-V</i>     print the version number of <b>debugfs </b>and exit.

       <b>-z </b><i>undo_file</i>
              Before overwriting a file system block, write the old
              contents of the block to an undo file.  This undo file can
              be used with e2undo(8) to restore the old contents of the
              file system should something go wrong.  If the empty
              string is passed as the undo_file argument, the undo file
              will be written to a file named debugfs-<i>device</i>.e2undo in
              the directory specified via the <i>E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR</i>
              environment variable.

              WARNING: The undo file cannot be used to recover from a
              power or system crash.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Many <b>debugfs </b>commands take a <i>filespec</i> as an argument to specify
       an inode (as opposed to a pathname) in the file system which is
       currently opened by <b>debugfs</b>.  The <i>filespec</i> argument may be
       specified in two forms.  The first form is an inode number
       surrounded by angle brackets, e.g., <i>&lt;2&gt;</i>.  The second form is a
       pathname; if the pathname is prefixed by a forward slash ('/'),
       then it is interpreted relative to the root of the file system
       which is currently opened by <b>debugfs</b>.  If not, the pathname is
       interpreted relative to the current working directory as
       maintained by <b>debugfs</b>.  This may be modified by using the <b>debugfs</b>
       command <i>cd</i>.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       This is a list of the commands which <b>debugfs </b>supports.

       <b>blocks </b><i>filespec</i>
              Print the blocks used by the inode <i>filespec</i> to stdout.

       <b>bmap </b><i>[ -a ] filespec logical_block [physical_block]</i>
              Print or set the physical block number corresponding to
              the logical block number <i>logical_block</i> in the inode
              <i>filespec</i>.  If the <i>-a</i> flag is specified, try to allocate a
              block if necessary.

       <b>block_dump </b><i>'[ -x ] [-f filespec] block_num</i>
              Dump the file system block given by <i>block_num</i> in hex and
              ASCII format to the console.  If the <i>-f</i> option is
              specified, the block number is relative to the start of
              the given <b>filespec</b>.  If the <i>-x</i> option is specified, the
              block is interpreted as an extended attribute block and
              printed to show the structure of extended attribute data
              structures.

       <b>cat </b><i>filespec</i>
              Dump the contents of the inode <i>filespec</i> to stdout.

       <b>cd </b><i>filespec</i>
              Change the current working directory to <i>filespec</i>.

       <b>chroot </b><i>filespec</i>
              Change the root directory to be the directory <i>filespec</i>.

       <b>close </b><i>[-a]</i>
              Close the currently open file system.  If the <i>-a</i> option is
              specified, write out any changes to the superblock and
              block group descriptors to all of the backup superblocks,
              not just to the master superblock.

       <b>clri </b><i>filespec</i>
              Clear the contents of the inode <i>filespec</i>.

       <b>copy_inode </b><i>source_inode destination_inode</i>
              Copy the contents of the inode structure in <i>source_inode</i>
              and use it to overwrite the inode structure at
              <i>destination_inode</i>.

       <b>dirsearch </b><i>filespec filename</i>
              Search the directory <i>filespec</i> for <i>filename</i>.

       <b>dirty </b><i>[-clean]</i>
              Mark the file system as dirty, so that the superblocks
              will be written on exit.  Additionally, clear the
              superblock's valid flag, or set it if <i>-clean</i> is specified.

       <b>dump </b><i>[-p] filespec out_file</i>
              Dump the contents of the inode <i>filespec</i> to the output file
              <i>out_file</i>.  If the <i>-p</i> option is given set the owner, group
              and permissions information on <i>out_file</i> to match <i>filespec</i>.

       <b>dump_mmp </b><i>[mmp_block]</i>
              Display the multiple-mount protection (mmp) field values.
              If <i>mmp_block</i> is specified then verify and dump the MMP
              values from the given block number, otherwise use the
              <b>s_mmp_block </b>field in the superblock to locate and use the
              existing MMP block.

       <b>dx_hash </b><i>[-cv] [-h hash_alg] [-s hash_seed] filename</i>
              Calculate the directory hash of <i>filename</i>.  The <i>-c</i> option
              will casefold the filename before calculating the hash.
              The <i>-v</i> option will make the <b>dx_hash </b>command more verbose
              and print the hash algorithm and hash seed to calculate
              the hash.  If a file system is open, use the hash_seed and
              default hash_algorithm used by the file system, although
              these can be overridden by the <i>-h</i> and <i>-s</i> options.  The
              hash algorithm specified with <i>-h</i> may be <b>legacy</b>, <b>half_md4</b>,
              or <b>tea</b>.  The hash seed specified with <i>-s</i> must be in UUID
              format.

       <b>dump_extents </b><i>[-n] [-l] filespec</i>
              Dump the extent tree of the inode <i>filespec</i>.  The <i>-n</i> flag
              will cause <b>dump_extents </b>to only display the interior nodes
              in the extent tree.   The <i>-l</i> flag will cause <b>dump_extents</b>
              to only display the leaf nodes in the extent tree.

              (Please note that the length and range of blocks for the
              last extent in an interior node is an estimate by the
              extents library functions, and is not stored in file
              system data structures.   Hence, the values displayed may
              not necessarily by accurate and does not indicate a
              problem or corruption in the file system.)

       <b>dump_unused</b>
              Dump unused blocks which contain non-null bytes.

       <b>ea_get </b><i>[-f outfile]|[-xVC] [-r] filespec attr_name</i>
              Retrieve the value of the extended attribute <i>attr_name</i> in
              the file <i>filespec</i> and write it either to stdout or to
              <i>outfile</i>.

       <b>ea_list </b><i>filespec</i>
              List the extended attributes associated with the file
              <i>filespec</i> to standard output.

       <b>ea_set </b><i>[-f infile] [-r] filespec attr_name attr_value</i>
              Set the value of the extended attribute <i>attr_name</i> in the
              file <i>filespec</i> to the string value <i>attr_value</i> or read it
              from <i>infile</i>.

       <b>ea_rm </b><i>filespec attr_names...</i>
              Remove the extended attribute <i>attr_name</i> from the file
              <i>filespec</i>.

       <b>expand_dir </b><i>filespec</i>
              Expand the directory <i>filespec</i>.

       <b>fallocate </b><i>filespec start_block [end_block]</i>
              Allocate and map uninitialized blocks into <i>filespec</i>
              between logical block <i>start_block</i> and <i>end_block</i>,
              inclusive.  If <i>end_block</i> is not supplied, this function
              maps until it runs out of free disk blocks or the maximum
              file size is reached.  Existing mappings are left alone.

       <b>feature </b><i>[fs_feature] [-fs_feature] ...</i>
              Set or clear various file system features in the
              superblock.  After setting or clearing any file system
              features that were requested, print the current state of
              the file system feature set.

       <b>filefrag </b><i>[-dvr] filespec</i>
              Print the number of contiguous extents in <i>filespec</i>.  If
              <i>filespec</i> is a directory and the <i>-d</i> option is not
              specified, <i>filefrag</i> will print the number of contiguous
              extents for each file in the directory.  The <i>-v</i> option
              will cause <i>filefrag</i> print a tabular listing of the
              contiguous extents in the file.  The <i>-r</i> option will cause
              <i>filefrag</i> to do a recursive listing of the directory.

       <b>find_free_block </b><i>[count [goal]]</i>
              Find the first <i>count</i> free blocks, starting from <i>goal</i> and
              allocate it.  Also available as <b>ffb</b>.

       <b>find_free_inode </b><i>[dir [mode]]</i>
              Find a free inode and allocate it.  If present, <i>dir</i>
              specifies the inode number of the directory which the
              inode is to be located.  The second optional argument <i>mode</i>
              specifies the permissions of the new inode.  (If the
              directory bit is set on the mode, the allocation routine
              will function differently.)  Also available as <b>ffi</b>.

       <b>freeb </b><i>block [count]</i>
              Mark the block number <i>block</i> as not allocated.  If the
              optional argument <i>count</i> is present, then <i>count</i> blocks
              starting at block number <i>block</i> will be marked as not
              allocated.

       <b>freefrag </b><i>[-c chunk_kb]</i>
              Report free space fragmentation on the currently open file
              system.  If the <i>-c</i> option is specified then the filefrag
              command will print how many free chunks of size <i>chunk_kb</i>
              can be found in the file system.  The chunk size must be a
              power of two and be larger than the file system block
              size.

       <b>freei </b><i>filespec [num]</i>
              Free the inode specified by <i>filespec</i>.  If <i>num</i> is
              specified, also clear num-1 inodes after the specified
              inode.

       <b>get_quota </b><i>quota_type id</i>
              Display quota information for given quota type (user,
              group, or project) and ID.

       <b>help   </b>Print a list of commands understood by <b>debugfs</b>.

       <b>htree_dump </b><i>filespec</i>
              Dump the hash-indexed directory <i>filespec</i>, showing its tree
              structure.

       <b>icheck </b><i>block ...</i>
              Print a listing of the inodes which use the one or more
              blocks specified on the command line.

       <b>inode_dump </b><i>[-b]|[-e]|[-x] filespec</i>
              Print the contents of the inode data structure in hex and
              ASCII format.  The <i>-b</i> option causes the command to only
              dump the contents of the <b>i_blocks </b>array.  The <i>-e</i> option
              causes the command to only dump the contents of the extra
              inode space, which is used to store in-line extended
              attributes. The <i>-x</i> option causes the command to dump the
              extra inode space interpreted and extended attributes.
              This is useful to debug corrupted inodes containing
              extended attributes.

       <b>imap </b><i>filespec</i>
              Print the location of the inode data structure (in the
              inode table) of the inode <i>filespec</i>.

       <b>init_filesys </b><i>device blocksize</i>
              Create an ext2 file system on <i>device</i> with device size
              <i>blocksize</i>.  Note that this does not fully initialize all
              of the data structures; to do this, use the <a href="mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>
              program.  This is just a call to the low-level library,
              which sets up the superblock and block descriptors.

       <b>journal_close</b>
              Close the open journal.

       <b>journal_open </b><i>[-c] [-v ver] [-f ext_jnl]</i>
              Opens the journal for reading and writing.  Journal
              checksumming can be enabled by supplying <i>-c</i>; checksum
              formats 2 and 3 can be selected with the <i>-v</i> option.  An
              external journal can be loaded from <i>ext_jnl</i>.

       <b>journal_run</b>
              Replay all transactions in the open journal.

       <b>journal_write </b><i>[-b blocks] [-r revoke] [-c] file</i>
              Write a transaction to the open journal.  The list of
              blocks to write should be supplied as a comma-separated
              list in <i>blocks</i>; the blocks themselves should be readable
              from <i>file</i>.  A list of blocks to revoke can be supplied as
              a comma-separated list in <i>revoke</i>.  By default, a commit
              record is written at the end; the <i>-c</i> switch writes an
              uncommitted transaction.

       <b>kill_file </b><i>filespec</i>
              Deallocate the inode <i>filespec</i> and its blocks.  Note that
              this does not remove any directory entries (if any) to
              this inode.  See the <a href="../man1/rm.1.html">rm(1)</a> command if you wish to unlink a
              file.

       <b>lcd </b><i>directory</i>
              Change the current working directory of the <b>debugfs</b>
              process to <i>directory</i> on the native file system.

       <b>list_quota </b><i>quota_type</i>
              Display quota information for given quota type (user,
              group, or project).

       <b>ln </b><i>filespec dest_file</i>
              Create a link named <i>dest_file</i> which is a hard link to
              <i>filespec</i>.  Note this does not adjust the inode reference
              counts.

       <b>logdump </b><i>[-acsOS] [-b block] [-n num_trans ] [-i filespec] [-f</i>
       <i>journal_file] [output_file]</i>
              Dump the contents of the ext3 journal.  By default, dump
              the journal inode as specified in the superblock.
              However, this can be overridden with the <i>-i</i> option, which
              dumps the journal from the internal inode given by
              <i>filespec</i>.  A regular file containing journal data can be
              specified using the <i>-f</i> option.  Finally, the <i>-s</i> option
              utilizes the backup information in the superblock to
              locate the journal.

              The <i>-S</i> option causes <b>logdump </b>to print the contents of the
              journal superblock.

              The <i>-a</i> option causes the <b>logdump </b>to print the contents of
              all of the descriptor blocks.  The <i>-b</i> option causes
              <b>logdump </b>to print all journal records that refer to the
              specified block.  The <i>-c</i> option will print out the
              contents of all of the data blocks selected by the <i>-a</i> and
              <i>-b</i> options.

              The <i>-O</i> option causes logdump to display old (checkpointed)
              journal entries.  This can be used to try to track down
              journal problems even after the journal has been replayed.

              The <i>-n</i> option causes <b>logdump </b>to continue past a journal
              block which is missing a magic number.  Instead, it will
              stop only when the entire log is printed or after
              <i>num_trans</i> transactions.

       <b>ls </b><i>[-l] [-c] [-d] [-p] [-r] filespec</i>
              Print a listing of the files in the directory <i>filespec</i>.
              The <i>-c</i> flag causes directory block checksums (if present)
              to be displayed.  The <i>-d</i> flag will list deleted entries in
              the directory.  The <i>-l</i> flag will list files using a more
              verbose format.  The <i>-p</i> flag will list the files in a
              format which is more easily parsable by scripts, as well
              as making it more clear when there are spaces or other
              non-printing characters at the end of filenames.  The <i>-r</i>
              flag will force the printing of the filename, even if it
              is encrypted.

       <b>list_deleted_inodes </b><i>[limit]</i>
              List deleted inodes, optionally limited to those deleted
              within <i>limit</i> seconds ago.  Also available as <b>lsdel</b>.

              This command was useful for recovering from accidental
              file deletions for ext2 file systems.  Unfortunately, it
              is not useful for this purpose if the files were deleted
              using ext3 or ext4, since the inode's data blocks are no
              longer available after the inode is released.

       <b>modify_inode </b><i>filespec</i>
              Modify the contents of the inode structure in the inode
              <i>filespec</i>.  Also available as <b>mi</b>.

       <b>mkdir </b><i>filespec</i>
              Make a directory.

       <b>mknod </b><i>filespec [p|[[c|b] major minor]]</i>
              Create a special device file (a named pipe, character or
              block device).  If a character or block device is to be
              made, the <i>major</i> and <i>minor</i> device numbers must be
              specified.

       <b>ncheck </b><i>[-c] inode_num ...</i>
              Take the requested list of inode numbers, and print a
              listing of pathnames to those inodes.  The <i>-c</i> flag will
              enable checking the file type information in the directory
              entry to make sure it matches the inode's type.

       <b>open </b><i>[-weficD] [-b blocksize] [-d image_filename] [-s superblock]</i>
       <i>[-z undo_file] device</i>
              Open a file system for editing.  The <i>-f</i> flag forces the
              file system to be opened even if there are some unknown or
              incompatible file system features which would normally
              prevent the file system from being opened.  The <i>-e</i> flag
              causes the file system to be opened in exclusive mode.
              The <i>-b</i>, <i>-c</i>, <i>-d</i>, <i>-i</i>, <i>-s</i>, <i>-w</i>, and <i>-D</i> options behave the same
              as the command-line options to <b>debugfs</b>.

       <b>punch </b><i>filespec start_blk [end_blk]</i>
              Delete the blocks in the inode ranging from <i>start_blk</i> to
              <i>end_blk</i>.  If <i>end_blk</i> is omitted then this command will
              function as a truncate command; that is, all of the blocks
              starting at <i>start_blk</i> through to the end of the file will
              be deallocated.

       <b>symlink </b><i>filespec target</i>
              Make a symbolic link.

       <b>pwd    </b>Print the current working directory.

       <b>quit   </b>Quit <b>debugfs</b>

       <b>rdump </b><i>directory[...] destination</i>
              Recursively dump <i>directory</i>, or multiple <i>directories</i>, and
              all its contents (including regular files, symbolic links,
              and other directories) into the named <i>destination</i>, which
              should be an existing directory on the native file system.

       <b>rm </b><i>pathname</i>
              Unlink <i>pathname</i>.  If this causes the inode pointed to by
              <i>pathname</i> to have no other references, deallocate the file.
              This command functions as the unlink() system call.

       <b>rmdir </b><i>filespec</i>
              Remove the directory <i>filespec</i>.

       <b>setb </b><i>block [count]</i>
              Mark the block number <i>block</i> as allocated.  If the optional
              argument <i>count</i> is present, then <i>count</i> blocks starting at
              block number <i>block</i> will be marked as allocated.

       <b>set_block_group </b><i>bgnum field value</i>
              Modify the block group descriptor specified by <i>bgnum</i> so
              that the block group descriptor field <i>field</i> has value
              <i>value</i>.  Also available as <b>set_bg</b>.

       <b>set_current_time </b><i>time</i>
              Set current time in seconds since Unix epoch to use when
              setting file system fields.

       <b>seti </b><i>filespec [num]</i>
              Mark inode <i>filespec</i> as in use in the inode bitmap.  If <i>num</i>
              is specified, also set num-1 inodes after the specified
              inode.

       <b>set_inode_field </b><i>filespec field value</i>
              Modify the inode specified by <i>filespec</i> so that the inode
              field <i>field</i> has value <i>value.</i>  The list of valid inode
              fields which can be set via this command can be displayed
              by using the command: <b>set_inode_field -l </b>Also available as
              <b>sif</b>.

       <b>set_mmp_value </b><i>field value</i>
              Modify the multiple-mount protection (MMP) data so that
              the MMP field <i>field</i> has value <i>value.</i>  The list of valid
              MMP fields which can be set via this command can be
              displayed by using the command: <b>set_mmp_value -l </b>Also
              available as <b>smmp</b>.

       <b>set_super_value </b><i>field value</i>
              Set the superblock field <i>field</i> to <i>value.</i>  The list of
              valid superblock fields which can be set via this command
              can be displayed by using the command: <b>set_super_value -l</b>
              Also available as <b>ssv</b>.

       <b>show_debugfs_params</b>
              Display <b>debugfs </b>parameters such as information about
              currently opened file system.

       <b>show_super_stats </b><i>[-h]</i>
              List the contents of the super block and the block group
              descriptors.  If the <i>-h</i> flag is given, only print out the
              superblock contents. Also available as <b>stats</b>.

       <b>stat </b><i>filespec</i>
              Display the contents of the inode structure of the inode
              <i>filespec</i>.

       <b>supported_features</b>
              Display file system features supported by this version of
              <b>debugfs</b>.

       <b>testb </b><i>block [count]</i>
              Test if the block number <i>block</i> is marked as allocated in
              the block bitmap.  If the optional argument <i>count</i> is
              present, then <i>count</i> blocks starting at block number <i>block</i>
              will be tested.

       <b>testi </b><i>filespec</i>
              Test if the inode <i>filespec</i> is marked as allocated in the
              inode bitmap.

       <b>undel </b><i>&lt;inode_number&gt; [pathname]</i>
              Undelete the specified inode number (which must be
              surrounded by angle brackets) so that it and its blocks
              are marked in use, and optionally link the recovered inode
              to the specified pathname.  The <b>e2fsck </b>command should
              always be run after using the <b>undel </b>command to recover
              deleted files.

              Note that if you are recovering a large number of deleted
              files, linking the inode to a directory may require the
              directory to be expanded, which could allocate a block
              that had been used by one of the yet-to-be-undeleted
              files.  So it is safer to undelete all of the inodes
              without specifying a destination pathname, and then in a
              separate pass, use the debugfs <b>link </b>command to link the
              inode to the destination pathname, or use <b>e2fsck </b>to check
              the file system and link all of the recovered inodes to
              the lost+found directory.

       <b>unlink </b><i>pathname</i>
              Remove the link specified by <i>pathname</i> to an inode.  Note
              this does not adjust the inode reference counts.

       <b>write </b><i>source_file out_file</i>
              Copy the contents of <i>source_file</i> into a newly-created file
              in the file system named <i>out_file</i>.

       <b>zap_block </b><i>[-f filespec] [-o offset] [-l length] [-p pattern]</i>
       <i>block_num</i>
              Overwrite the block specified by <i>block_num</i> with zero (NUL)
              bytes, or if <i>-p</i> is given use the byte specified by
              <i>pattern</i>.  If <i>-f</i> is given then <i>block_num</i> is relative to the
              start of the file given by <i>filespec</i>.  The <i>-o</i> and <i>-l</i>
              options limit the range of bytes to zap to the specified
              <i>offset</i> and <i>length</i> relative to the start of the block.

       <b>zap_block </b><i>[-f filespec] [-b bit] block_num</i>
              Bit-flip portions of the physical <i>block_num</i>.  If <i>-f</i> is
              given, then <i>block_num</i> is a logical block relative to the
              start of <i>filespec</i>.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DEBUGFS_PAGER, PAGER</b>
              The <b>debugfs </b>program always pipes the output of the some
              commands through a pager program.  These commands include:
              <i>show_super_stats</i> (<i>stats</i>), <i>list_directory</i> (<i>ls</i>),
              <i>show_inode_info</i> (<i>stat</i>), <i>list_deleted_inodes</i> (<i>lsdel</i>), and
              <i>htree_dump</i>.  The specific pager can explicitly specified
              by the <b>DEBUGFS_PAGER </b>environment variable, and if it is
              not set, by the <b>PAGER </b>environment variable.

              Note that since a pager is always used, the <a href="../man1/less.1.html">less(1)</a> pager
              is not particularly appropriate, since it clears the
              screen before displaying the output of the command and
              clears the output the screen when the pager is exited.
              Many users prefer to use the <a href="../man1/less.1.html">less(1)</a> pager for most
              purposes, which is why the <b>DEBUGFS_PAGER </b>environment
              variable is available to override the more general <b>PAGER</b>
              environment variable.
