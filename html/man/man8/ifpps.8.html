NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ifpps - top-like networking and system statistics
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ifpps </b>{ [<i>options</i>] | [<i>device</i>] }
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       ifpps is a small utility which periodically provides top-like
       networking and system statistics from the kernel. ifpps gathers
       its data directly from procfs files and does not make use of any
       user space monitoring libraries which would falsify statistics
       under high load.

       For instance, consider the following scenario: two directly
       connected Linux machines with Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 2.40GHz
       CPUs, 4 GB RAM, and an Intel 82566DC-2 Gigabit Ethernet NIC are
       used for performance evaluation.  One machine generates 64 byte
       network packets by using the kernel space packet generator pktgen
       with a maximum possible packet rate. The other machine displays
       statistics about incoming network packets by using i) <a href="iptraf.8.html">iptraf(8)</a>
       and ii) ifpps.

       iptraf which incorporates <b>pcap</b>(3) shows an average packet rate of
       246,000 pps while on the other hand ifpps shows an average packet
       rate of 1,378,000 pps. Hence, due to packet copies and deferring
       statistics creation into user space, a measurement error of
       approximately 460 percent occurs. Tools like iptraf might display
       much more information such as TCP per flow statistics (hence the
       use of the pcap library).  This is not possible with ifpps,
       because overall networking statistics are its focus; statistics,
       which are also fairly reliable under high packet load.

       ifpps also periodically displays CPU load, interrupt, software
       interrupt data per sample interval as well as total interrupts,
       all per CPU. In case the number of CPUs exceeds 5 or the number
       specified by the user with the <b>-n </b>command line option, ifpps will
       only display this number top heavy hitters. The topmost heavy
       hitter CPU will be marked with “+”.  The least heavy hitter will
       always be displayed and is marked with “-”. In addition, the
       average for all the above per-CPU data is shown. Optionally the
       median values can be displayed using the <b>-m </b>command line option.

       ifpps also supports directly the <b>gnuplot</b>(1) data sample format.
       This facilitates creation of gnuplot figures from ifpps time
       series.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d &lt;netdev&gt;, --dev &lt;netdev&gt;</b>
              Networking device to fetch statistics from, for example
              eth0, wlan0.

       <b>-n, --num-cpus</b>
              Set maximum number of top hitter CPUs (in terms of time
              spent in system/user mode) to display in ncurses mode,
              default is 10.

       <b>-t &lt;time&gt;, --interval &lt;time&gt;</b>
              Statistics refresh interval in milliseconds, default is
              1000ms.

       <b>-c, --csv</b>
              Output (once) the ncurses data to the terminal as
              <b>gnuplot</b>(1)-ready data.

       <b>-l, --loop</b>
              Continuously output the terminal data after a refresh
              interval. This option is only available if option <b>-c </b>is
              given. For <b>-l </b>it is usually recommended to redirect the
              output into a file that is to be processed later with
              <b>gnuplot</b>(1).

       <b>-m, --median</b>
              Show median values across all CPUs for CPU load,
              interrupts (per interval and absolute) and software
              interrupts.

       <b>-o, --omit-header</b>
              Omit printing the CSV header. This option is only
              available if <b>-c </b>is given.

       <b>-p, --promisc</b>
              Turn on promiscuous mode for the given networking device.

       <b>-P, --percentage</b>
              Show percentage of current throughput in relation to
              theoretical line rate.

       <b>-W, --no-warn</b>
              Suppress possible warnings in the ncurses output, e.g.
              about a too low sampling interval that could cause
              performance regression.

       <b>-v, --version</b>
              Show version information.

       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Show user help.
</pre> <h2>
USAGE EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ifpps eth0</b>
              Default ncurses output for the eth0 device.

       <b>ifpps -pd eth0</b>
              Ncurses output for the eth0 device in promiscuous mode.

       <b>ifpps -lpcd wlan0 &gt; plot.dat</b>
              Continuous terminal output for the wlan0 device in
              promiscuous mode.
</pre> <h2>
NOTE </h2>
<pre>
       On 10Gbit/s cards or higher, receive and transmit statistics are
       usually accumulated at a higher duration interval than 1 second.
       Thus, it might be advisable to alter the timing to a higher
       accumulation interval for such cards.
