NAME </h2>
<pre>
       btrfs-receive - receive subvolumes from send stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>btrfs receive </b>[options] <i>&lt;path&gt;</i>

       or

       <b>btrfs receive </b>--dump [options]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Receive a stream of changes and replicate one or more subvolumes
       that were previously generated by <b>btrfs send</b>. The received
       subvolumes are stored to <i>path</i>, unless <i>--dump</i> option is given.

       If <i>--dump</i> option is specified, <b>btrfs receive </b>will only do the
       validation of the stream, and print the stream metadata, one
       operation per line.

       <b>btrfs receive </b>will fail in the following cases:

        1. receiving subvolume already exists

        2. previously received subvolume has been changed after it was
           received

        3. default subvolume has changed or you didn’t mount the
           filesystem at the toplevel subvolume

       A subvolume is made read-only after the receiving process
       finishes successfully (see BUGS below).

       <b>Options</b>

       -f <i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i>
           read the stream from <i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i> instead of stdin,

       -C|--chroot
           confine the process to <i>path</i> using <a href="../man1/chroot.1.html">chroot(1)</a>

       -e
           terminate after receiving an <i>end cmd</i> marker in the stream.

           Without this option the receiver side terminates only in case
           of an error on end of file.

       -E|--max-errors <i>&lt;NERR&gt;</i>
           terminate as soon as NERR errors occur while stream
           processing commands from the stream

           Default value is 1. A value of 0 means no limit.

       -m <i>&lt;ROOTMOUNT&gt;</i>
           the root mount point of the destination filesystem

           By default the mountpoint is searched in <i>/proc/self/mounts</i>.
           If <i>/proc</i> is not accessible, eg. in a chroot environment, use
           this option to tell us where this filesystem is mounted.

       --dump
           dump the stream metadata, one line per operation

           Does not require the <i>path</i> parameter. The filesystem remains
           unchanged.

       -q|--quiet
           (deprecated) alias for global <i>-q</i> option

       -v
           (deprecated) alias for global <i>-v</i> option

       <b>Global options</b>

       -v|--verbose
           increase verbosity about performed actions, print details
           about each operation

       -q|--quiet
           suppress all messages except errors
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>btrfs receive </b>sets the subvolume read-only after it completes
       successfully. However, while the receive is in progress, users
       who have write access to files or directories in the receiving
       <i>path</i> can add, remove, or modify files, in which case the
       resulting read-only subvolume will not be an exact copy of the
       sent subvolume.

       If the intention is to create an exact copy, the receiving <i>path</i>
       should be protected from access by users until the receive
       operation has completed and the subvolume is set to read-only.

       Additionally, receive does not currently do a very good job of
       validating that an incremental send stream actually makes sense,
       and it is thus possible for a specially crafted send stream to
       create a subvolume with reflinks to arbitrary files in the same
       filesystem. Because of this, users are advised to not use <b>btrfs</b>
       <b>receive </b>on send streams from untrusted sources, and to protect
       trusted streams when sending them across untrusted networks.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>btrfs receive </b>returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero
       is returned in case of failure.
