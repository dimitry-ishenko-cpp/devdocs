       fsck - check and repair a Linux file system
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>fsck </b>[ <b>-sAVRTMNP </b>] [ <b>-C </b>[ <i>fd</i> ] ] [ <b>-t </b><i>fstype</i> ] <i>[filesys ... ]</i>
       [--] [ <b>fs-specific-options </b>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>fsck </b>is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux
       file systems.  <i>filesys</i> can be a device name (e.g.  <i>/dev/hdc1</i>,
       <i>/dev/sdb2</i>), a mount point (e.g.  <i>/</i>, <i>/usr</i>, <i>/home</i>), or an ext2
       label or UUID specifier (e.g.
       UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or LABEL=root).
       Normally, the <b>fsck </b>program will try to handle file systems on
       different physical disk drives in parallel to reduce the total
       amount of time needed to check all of the file systems.

       If no file systems are specified on the command line, and the <b>-A</b>
       option is not specified, <b>fsck </b>will default to checking file
       systems in <b>/etc/fstab </b>serially.  This is equivalent to the <b>-As</b>
       options.

       The exit code returned by <b>fsck </b>is the sum of the following
       conditions:
            0    - No errors
            1    - File system errors corrected
            2    - System should be rebooted
            4    - File system errors left uncorrected
            8    - Operational error
            16   - Usage or syntax error
            32   - Fsck canceled by user request
            128  - Shared library error
       The exit code returned when multiple file systems are checked is
       the bit-wise OR of the exit codes for each file system that is
       checked.

       In actuality, <b>fsck </b>is simply a front-end for the various file
       system checkers (<b>fsck</b>.<i>fstype</i>) available under Linux.  The file
       system-specific checker is searched for in <i>/sbin</i> first, then in
       <i>/etc/fs</i> and <i>/etc</i>, and finally in the directories listed in the
       PATH environment variable.  Please see the file system-specific
       checker manual pages for further details.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-s     </b>Serialize <b>fsck </b>operations.  This is a good idea if you are
              checking multiple file systems and the checkers are in an
              interactive mode.  (Note: <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> runs in an interactive
              mode by default.  To make <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> run in a non-
              interactive mode, you must either specify the <b>-p </b>or <b>-a</b>
              option, if you wish for errors to be corrected
              automatically, or the <b>-n </b>option if you do not.)

       <b>-t </b><i>fslist</i>
              Specifies the type(s) of file system to be checked.  When
              the <b>-A </b>flag is specified, only file systems that match
              <i>fslist</i> are checked.  The <i>fslist</i> parameter is a comma-
              separated list of file systems and options specifiers.
              All of the file systems in this comma-separated list may
              be prefixed by a negation operator '<b>no</b>' or '<b>!</b>', which
              requests that only those file systems not listed in <i>fslist</i>
              will be checked.  If all of the file systems in <i>fslist</i> are
              not prefixed by a negation operator, then only those file
              systems listed in <i>fslist</i> will be checked.

              Options specifiers may be included in the comma-separated
              <i>fslist</i>.  They must have the format <b>opts=</b><i>fs-option</i>.  If an
              options specifier is present, then only file systems which
              contain <i>fs-option</i> in their mount options field of
              <b>/etc/fstab </b>will be checked.  If the options specifier is
              prefixed by a negation operator, then only those file
              systems that do not have <i>fs-option</i> in their mount options
              field of <b>/etc/fstab </b>will be checked.

              For example, if <b>opts=ro </b>appears in <i>fslist</i>, then only file
              systems listed in <b>/etc/fstab </b>with the <b>ro </b>option will be
              checked.

              For compatibility with Mandrake distributions whose boot
              scripts depend upon an unauthorized UI change to the <b>fsck</b>
              program, if a file system type of <b>loop </b>is found in <i>fslist</i>,
              it is treated as if <b>opts=loop </b>were specified as an
              argument to the <b>-t </b>option.

              Normally, the file system type is deduced by searching for
              <i>filesys</i> in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file and using the corresponding
              entry.  If the type can not be deduced, and there is only
              a single file system given as an argument to the <b>-t</b>
              option, <b>fsck </b>will use the specified file system type.  If
              this type is not available, then the default file system
              type (currently ext2) is used.

       <b>-A     </b>Walk through the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file and try to check all file
              systems in one run.  This option is typically used from
              the <i>/etc/rc</i> system initialization file, instead of
              multiple commands for checking a single file system.

              The root file system will be checked first unless the <b>-P</b>
              option is specified (see below).  After that, file systems
              will be checked in the order specified by the <i>fs_passno</i>
              (the sixth) field in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file.  File Systems
              with a <i>fs_passno</i> value of 0 are skipped and are not
              checked at all.  File Systems with a <i>fs_passno</i> value of
              greater than zero will be checked in order, with file
              systems with the lowest <i>fs_passno</i> number being checked
              first.  If there are multiple file systems with the same
              pass number, fsck will attempt to check them in parallel,
              although it will avoid running multiple file system checks
              on the same physical disk.

              Hence, a very common configuration in <i>/etc/fstab</i> files is
              to set the root file system to have a <i>fs_passno</i> value of 1
              and to set all other file systems to have a <i>fs_passno</i>
              value of 2.  This will allow <b>fsck </b>to automatically run
              file system checkers in parallel if it is advantageous to
              do so.  System administrators might choose not to use this
              configuration if they need to avoid multiple file system
              checks running in parallel for some reason --- for
              example, if the machine in question is short on memory so
              that excessive paging is a concern.

       <b>-C </b>[  <i>fd</i>  ]
              Display completion/progress bars for those file system
              checkers (currently only for ext2 and ext3) which support
              them.   Fsck will manage the file system checkers so that
              only one of them will display a progress bar at a time.
              GUI front-ends may specify a file descriptor <i>fd</i>, in which
              case the progress bar information will be sent to that
              file descriptor.

       <b>-M     </b>Do not check mounted file systems and return an exit code
              of 0 for mounted file systems.

       <b>-N     </b>Don't execute, just show what would be done.

       <b>-P     </b>When the <b>-A </b>flag is set, check the root file system in
              parallel with the other file systems.  This is not the
              safest thing in the world to do, since if the root file
              system is in doubt things like the <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> executable
              might be corrupted!  This option is mainly provided for
              those sysadmins who don't want to repartition the root
              file system to be small and compact (which is really the
              right solution).

       <b>-R     </b>When checking all file systems with the <b>-A </b>flag, skip the
              root file system (in case it's already mounted read-
              write).

       <b>-T     </b>Don't show the title on startup.

       <b>-V     </b>Produce verbose output, including all file system-specific
              commands that are executed.

       <b>fs-specific-options</b>
              Options which are not understood by <b>fsck </b>are passed to the
              file system-specific checker.  These arguments <b>must </b>not
              take arguments, as there is no way for <b>fsck </b>to be able to
              properly guess which arguments take options and which
              don't.

              Options and arguments which follow the <b>-- </b>are treated as
              file system-specific options to be passed to the file
              system-specific checker.

              Please note that fsck is not designed to pass arbitrarily
              complicated options to file system-specific checkers.  If
              you're doing something complicated, please just execute
              the file system-specific checker directly.  If you pass
              <b>fsck </b>some horribly complicated option and arguments, and
              it doesn't do what you expect, <b>don't bother reporting it</b>
              <b>as a bug.  </b>You're almost certainly doing something that
              you shouldn't be doing with <b>fsck.</b>

       Options to different file system-specific fsck's are not
       standardized.  If in doubt, please consult the man pages of the
       file system-specific checker.  Although not guaranteed, the
       following options are supported by most file system checkers:

       <b>-a     </b>Automatically repair the file system without any questions
              (use this option with caution).  Note that <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a>
              supports <b>-a </b>for backwards compatibility only.  This option
              is mapped to <b>e2fsck</b>'s <b>-p </b>option which is safe to use,
              unlike the <b>-a </b>option that some file system checkers
              support.

       <b>-n     </b>For some file system-specific checkers, the <b>-n </b>option will
              cause the fs-specific fsck to avoid attempting to repair
              any problems, but simply report such problems to stdout.
              This is however not true for all file system-specific
              checkers.  In particular, <b>fsck.reiserfs</b>(8) will not report
              any corruption if given this option.  <a href="fsck.minix.8.html">fsck.minix(8)</a> does
              not support the <b>-n </b>option at all.

       <b>-r     </b>Interactively repair the file system (ask for
              confirmations).  Note: It is generally a bad idea to use
              this option if multiple fsck's are being run in parallel.
              Also note that this is <b>e2fsck</b>'s default behavior; it
              supports this option for backwards compatibility reasons
              only.

       <b>-y     </b>For some file system-specific checkers, the <b>-y </b>option will
              cause the fs-specific fsck to always attempt to fix any
              detected file system corruption automatically.  Sometimes
              an expert may be able to do better driving the fsck
              manually.  Note that <b>not </b>all file system-specific checkers
              implement this option.  In particular <a href="fsck.minix.8.html">fsck.minix(8)</a> and
              <a href="fsck.cramfs.8.html">fsck.cramfs(8)</a> does not support the <b>-y </b>option as of this
              writing.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>fsck </b>program's behavior is affected by the following
       environment variables:

       <b>FSCK_FORCE_ALL_PARALLEL</b>
              If this environment variable is set, <b>fsck </b>will attempt to
              run all of the specified file systems in parallel,
              regardless of whether the file systems appear to be on the
              same device.  (This is useful for RAID systems or high-end
              storage systems such as those sold by companies such as
              IBM or EMC.)

       <b>FSCK_MAX_INST</b>
              This environment variable will limit the maximum number of
              file system checkers that can be running at one time.
              This allows configurations which have a large number of
              disks to avoid <b>fsck </b>starting too many file system checkers
              at once, which might overload CPU and memory resources
              available on the system.  If this value is zero, then an
              unlimited number of processes can be spawned.  This is
              currently the default, but future versions of <b>fsck </b>may
              attempt to automatically determine how many file system
              checks can be run based on gathering accounting data from
              the operating system.

       <b>PATH   </b>The <b>PATH </b>environment variable is used to find file system
              checkers.  A set of system directories are searched first:
              <b>/sbin</b>, <b>/sbin/fs.d</b>, <b>/sbin/fs</b>, <b>/etc/fs</b>, and <b>/etc</b>.  Then the
              set of directories found in the <b>PATH </b>environment are
              searched.

       <b>FSTAB_FILE</b>
              This environment variable allows the system administrator
              to override the standard location of the <b>/etc/fstab </b>file.
              It is also useful for developers who are testing <b>fsck</b>.
