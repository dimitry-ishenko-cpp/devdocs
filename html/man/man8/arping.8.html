</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       arping - send ARP REQUEST to a neighbour host
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>arping </b>[<b>-AbDfhqUV</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>count</i>] [<b>-w </b><i>deadline</i>] [<b>-i </b><i>interval</i>]
              [<b>-s </b><i>source</i>] [<b>-I </b><i>interface</i>] {destination}
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Ping <i>destination</i> on device <i>interface</i> by ARP packets, using source
       address <i>source</i>.

       arping supports IPv4 addresses only. For IPv6, see <b>ndisc6</b>(8).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-A</b>
           The same as <b>-U</b>, but ARP REPLY packets used instead of ARP
           REQUEST.

       <b>-b</b>
           Send only MAC level broadcasts. Normally <b>arping </b>starts from
           sending broadcast, and switch to unicast after reply
           received.

       <b>-c </b><i>count</i>
           Stop after sending <i>count</i> ARP REQUEST packets. With <i>deadline</i>
           option, instead wait for <i>count</i> ARP REPLY packets, or until
           the timeout expires.

       <b>-D</b>
           Duplicate address detection mode (DAD). See RFC2131, 4.4.1.
           Returns 0, if DAD succeeded i.e. no replies are received.

       <b>-f</b>
           Finish after the first reply confirming that target is alive.

       <b>-I </b><i>interface</i>
           Name of network device where to send ARP REQUEST packets.

       <b>-h</b>
           Print help page and exit.

       <b>-q</b>
           Quiet output. Nothing is displayed.

       <b>-s </b><i>source</i>
           IP source address to use in ARP packets. If this option is
           absent, source address is:

               • In DAD mode (with option <b>-D</b>) set to 0.0.0.0.

               • In Unsolicited ARP mode (with options <b>-U </b>or <b>-A</b>) set to
               <i>destination</i>.

               • Otherwise, it is calculated from routing tables.

       <b>-U</b>
           Unsolicited ARP mode to update neighbours' ARP caches. No
           replies are expected.

       <b>-V</b>
           Print version of the program and exit.

       <b>-w </b><i>deadline</i>
           Specify a timeout, in seconds, before <b>arping </b>exits regardless
           of how many packets have been sent or received. If any
           replies are received, exit with status 0, otherwise status 1.
           When combined with the <i>count</i> option, exit with status 0 if
           <i>count</i> replies are received before the deadline expiration,
           otherwise status 1.

       <b>-i </b><i>interval</i>
           Specify an interval, in seconds, between packets.

SECURITY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>arping </b>requires CAP_NET_RAW capability to be executed. It is not
       recommended to be used as set-uid root, because it allows user to
       modify ARP caches of neighbour hosts.
