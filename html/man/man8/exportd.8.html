NAME </h2>
<pre>
       nfsv4.exportd - NFSv4 Server Mount Daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/usr/sbin/nfsv4.exportd [</b><i>options</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>nfsv4.exportd </b>is used to manage NFSv4 exports.  The NFS
       server (<i>nfsd</i>) maintains a cache of authentication and
       authorization information which is used to identify the source of
       each request, and then what access permissions that source has to
       any local filesystem.  When required information is not found in
       the cache, the server sends a request to <b>nfsv4.exportd </b>to fill in
       the missing information.  <b>nfsv4.exportd </b>uses a table of
       information stored in <b>/var/lib/nfs/etab </b>and maintained by
       <a href="exportfs.8.html">exportfs(8)</a>, possibly based on the contents of <a href="../man5/exports.5.html">exports(5)</a>, to
       respond to each request.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d kind  or  --debug kind</b>
              Turn on debugging. Valid kinds are: all, auth, call,
              general and parse.

       <b>-l </b>or <b>--log-auth</b>
              Enable logging of responses to authentication and access
              requests from nfsd.  Each response is then cached by the
              kernel for 30 minutes (or as set by <b>--ttl </b>below), and will
              be refreshed after 15 minutes (half the ttl time) if the
              relevant client remains active.  Note that <b>-l </b>is
              equivalent to <b>-d auth </b>and so can be enabled in
              <b>/etc/nfs.conf </b>with <b>"debug = auth" </b>in the <b>[exportd]</b>
              section.

       <b>-i </b>or <b>--cache-use-ipaddr</b>
              Normally each client IP address is matched against each
              host identifier (name, wildcard, netgroup etc) found in
              <b>/etc/exports </b>and a combined identity is formed from all
              matching identifiers.  Often many clients will map to the
              same combined identity so performing this mapping reduces
              the number of distinct access details that the kernel
              needs to store.  Specifying the <b>-i </b>option suppresses this
              mapping so that access to each filesystem is requested and
              cached separately for each client IP address.  Doing this
              can increase the burden of updating the cache slightly,
              but can make the log messages produced by the <b>-l </b>option
              easier to read.

       <b>-T  or  --ttl</b>
              Provide a time-to-live (TTL) for cached information given
              to the kernel.  The kernel will normally request an update
              if the information is needed after half of this time has
              expired.  Increasing the provided number, which is in
              seconds, reduces the rate of cache update requests, and
              this is particularly noticeable when these requests are
              logged with <b>-l</b>.  However increasing also means that
              changes to hostname to address mappings can take longer to
              be noticed.  The default TTL is 1800 (30 minutes).

       <b>-F  or  --foreground</b>
              Run in foreground (do not daemonize)

       <b>-h  or  --help</b>
              Display usage message.

       <b>-t N </b>or <b>--num-threads=N </b>or <b>--num-threads N</b>
              This option specifies the number of worker threads that
              <b>nfsv4.exports </b>spawns.  The default is 1 thread, which is
              probably enough.  More threads are usually only needed for
              NFS servers which need to handle mount storms of hundreds
              of NFS mounts in a few seconds, or when your DNS server is
              slow or unreliable.

       <b>-g </b>or <b>--manage-gids</b>
              Accept requests from the kernel to map user id numbers
              into lists of group id numbers for use in access control.
              An NFS request will normally (except when using Kerberos
              or other cryptographic authentication) contain a user-id
              and a list of group-ids.  Due to a limitation in the NFS
              protocol, at most 16 groups ids can be listed.  If you use
              the <b>-g </b>flag, then the list of group ids received from the
              client will be replaced by a list of group ids determined
              by an appropriate lookup on the server. Note that the
              'primary' group id is not affected so a <b>newgroup </b>command
              on the client will still be effective.  This function
              requires a Linux Kernel with version at least 2.6.21.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE </h2>
<pre>
       Many of the options that can be set on the command line can also
       be controlled through values set in the <b>[exportd] </b>or, in some
       cases, the <b>[nfsd] </b>sections of the <i>/etc/nfs.conf</i> configuration
       file.  Values recognized in the <b>[exportd] </b>section include
       <b>cache-use-ipaddr , ttl</b>, <b>manage-gids</b>, and <b>debug </b>which each have
       the same effect as the option with the same name.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/exports</i>
              input file for <b>exportfs</b>, listing exports, export options,
              and access control lists
