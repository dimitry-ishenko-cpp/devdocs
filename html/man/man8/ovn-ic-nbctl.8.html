NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ovn-ic-nbctl - Open Virtual Network interconnection northbound db
       management utility
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>[<i>options</i>] <i>command</i> [<i>arg</i>...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This utility can be used to manage the OVN interconnection
       northbound database.
</pre> <h2>
GENERAL COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>init   </b>Initializes the database, if it is empty. If the database
              has already been initialized, this command has no effect.

       <b>show   </b>Prints a brief overview of the database contents.
</pre> <h2>
TRANSIT SWITCH COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>ts-add </b><i>switch</i>
              Creates a new transit switch named <i>switch</i>.

              Transit switch names must be unique. Adding a duplicated
              name results in error. With <b>--may-exist</b>, adding a
              duplicate name succeeds but does not create a new transit
              switch.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>ts-del </b><i>switch</i>
              Deletes <i>switch</i>. It is an error if <i>switch</i> does not exist,
              unless <b>--if-exists </b>is specified.

       <b>ts-list</b>
              Lists all existing switches on standard output, one per
              line.
</pre> <h2>
DATABASE COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       These commands query and modify the contents of <b>ovsdb </b>tables.
       They are a slight abstraction of the <b>ovsdb </b>interface and as such
       they operate at a lower level than other <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>commands.

       <i>Identifying Tables, Records, and Columns</i>

       Each of these commands has a <i>table</i> parameter to identify a table
       within the database. Many of them also take a <i>record</i> parameter
       that identifies a particular record within a table. The <i>record</i>
       parameter may be the UUID for a record, which may be abbreviated
       to its first 4 (or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique.
       Many tables offer additional ways to identify records. Some
       commands also take <i>column</i> parameters that identify a particular
       field within the records in a table.

       For a list of tables and their columns, see <a href="../man5/ovn-ic-nb.5.html">ovn-ic-nb(5)</a> or see
       the table listing from the <b>--help </b>option.

       Record names must be specified in full and with correct
       capitalization, except that UUIDs may be abbreviated to their
       first 4 (or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique within
       the table. Names of tables and columns are not case-sensitive,
       and <b>- </b>and <b>_ </b>are treated interchangeably. Unique abbreviations of
       table and column names are acceptable, e.g. <b>t </b>or <b>transit </b>is
       sufficient to identify the <b>Transit_Switch </b>table.

       <i>Database Values</i>

       Each column in the database accepts a fixed type of data. The
       currently defined basic types, and their representations, are:

              integer
                     A decimal integer in the range -2**63 to 2**63-1,
                     inclusive.

              real   A floating-point number.

              Boolean
                     True or false, written <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>, respectively.

              string An arbitrary Unicode string, except that null bytes
                     are not allowed. Quotes are optional for most
                     strings that begin with an English letter or
                     underscore and consist only of letters,
                     underscores, hyphens, and periods. However, <b>true</b>
                     and <b>false </b>and strings that match the syntax of
                     UUIDs (see below) must be enclosed in double quotes
                     to distinguish them from other basic types. When
                     double quotes are used, the syntax is that of
                     strings in JSON, e.g. backslashes may be used to
                     escape special characters. The empty string must be
                     represented as a pair of double quotes (<b>""</b>).

              UUID   Either a universally unique identifier in the style
                     of RFC 4122, e.g.
                     <b>f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</b>, or an <b>@</b><i>name</i>
                     defined by a <b>get </b>or <b>create </b>command within the same
                     <b>ovs-vsctl </b>invocation.

       Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or
       a single comma. When multiple values are present, duplicates are
       not allowed, and order is not important. Conversely, some
       database columns can have an empty set of values, represented as
       <b>[]</b>, and square brackets may optionally enclose other non-empty
       sets or single values as well.

       A few database columns are ``maps’’ of key-value pairs, where the
       key and the value are each some fixed database type. These are
       specified in the form <i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>, where <i>key</i> and <i>value</i> follow the
       syntax for the column’s key type and value type, respectively.
       When multiple pairs are present (separated by spaces or a comma),
       duplicate keys are not allowed, and again the order is not
       important. Duplicate values are allowed. An empty map is
       represented as <b>{}</b>. Curly braces may optionally enclose non-empty
       maps as well (but use quotes to prevent the shell from expanding
       <b>other-config={0=x,1=y} </b>into <b>other-config=0=x other-config=1=y</b>,
       which may not have the desired effect).

       <i>Database Command Syntax</i>

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--columns=</b><i>column</i>[<b>,</b><i>column</i>]...] <b>list </b><i>table</i>
              [<i>record</i>]...
                     Lists the data in each specified <i>record</i>. If no
                     records are specified, lists all the records in
                     <i>table</i>.

                     If <b>--columns </b>is specified, only the requested
                     columns are listed, in the specified order.
                     Otherwise, all columns are listed, in alphabetical
                     order by column name.

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if any
                     specified <i>record</i> does not exist. With <b>--if-exists</b>,
                     the command ignores any <i>record</i> that does not exist,
                     without producing any output.

              [<b>--columns=</b><i>column</i>[<b>,</b><i>column</i>]...] <b>find </b><i>table</i>
              [<i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]<b>=</b><i>value</i>]...
                     Lists the data in each record in <i>table</i> whose <i>column</i>
                     equals <i>value</i> or, if <i>key</i> is specified, whose <i>column</i>
                     contains a <i>key</i> with the specified <i>value</i>. The
                     following operators may be used where <b>= </b>is written
                     in the syntax summary:

                     <b>= != &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=</b>
                            Selects records in which <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]
                            equals, does not equal, is less than, is
                            greater than, is less than or equal to, or
                            is greater than or equal to <i>value</i>,
                            respectively.

                            Consider <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] and <i>value</i> as sets of
                            elements. Identical sets are considered
                            equal. Otherwise, if the sets have different
                            numbers of elements, then the set with more
                            elements is considered to be larger.
                            Otherwise, consider a element from each set
                            pairwise, in increasing order within each
                            set. The first pair that differs determines
                            the result. (For a column that contains key-
                            value pairs, first all the keys are
                            compared, and values are considered only if
                            the two sets contain identical keys.)

                     <b>{=} {!=}</b>
                            Test for set equality or inequality,
                            respectively.

                     <b>{&lt;=}   </b>Selects records in which <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] is a
                            subset of <i>value</i>. For example,
                            <b>flood-vlans{&lt;=}1,2 </b>selects records in which
                            the <b>flood-vlans </b>column is the empty set or
                            contains 1 or 2 or both.

                     <b>{&lt;}    </b>Selects records in which <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] is a
                            proper subset of <i>value</i>. For example,
                            <b>flood-vlans{&lt;}1,2 </b>selects records in which
                            the <b>flood-vlans </b>column is the empty set or
                            contains 1 or 2 but not both.

                     <b>{&gt;=} {&gt;}</b>
                            Same as <b>{&lt;=} </b>and <b>{&lt;}</b>, respectively, except
                            that the relationship is reversed. For
                            example, <b>flood-vlans{&gt;=}1,2 </b>selects records
                            in which the <b>flood-vlans </b>column contains
                            both 1 and 2.

                     The following operators are available only in Open
                     vSwitch 2.16 and later:

                     <b>{in}   </b>Selects records in which every element in
                            <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] is also in <i>value</i>. (This is the
                            same as <b>{&lt;=}</b>.)

                     <b>{not-in}</b>
                            Selects records in which every element in
                            <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] is not in <i>value</i>.

                     For arithmetic operators (<b>= != &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=</b>), when <i>key</i>
                     is specified but a particular record’s <i>column</i> does
                     not contain <i>key</i>, the record is always omitted from
                     the results. Thus, the condition
                     <b>other-config:mtu!=1500 </b>matches records that have a
                     <b>mtu </b>key whose value is not 1500, but not those that
                     lack an <b>mtu </b>key.

                     For the set operators, when <i>key</i> is specified but a
                     particular record’s <i>column</i> does not contain <i>key</i>,
                     the comparison is done against an empty set. Thus,
                     the condition <b>other-config:mtu{!=}1500 </b>matches
                     records that have a <b>mtu </b>key whose value is not 1500
                     and those that lack an <b>mtu </b>key.

                     Don’t forget to escape <b>&lt; </b>or <b>&gt; </b>from interpretation
                     by the shell.

                     If <b>--columns </b>is specified, only the requested
                     columns are listed, in the specified order.
                     Otherwise all columns are listed, in alphabetical
                     order by column name.

                     The UUIDs shown for rows created in the same
                     <b>ovs-vsctl </b>invocation will be wrong.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--id=@</b><i>name</i>] <b>get </b><i>table record</i>
              [<i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]]...
                     Prints the value of each specified <i>column</i> in the
                     given <i>record</i> in <i>table</i>. For map columns, a <i>key</i> may
                     optionally be specified, in which case the value
                     associated with <i>key</i> in the column is printed,
                     instead of the entire map.

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <i>record</i> does
                     not exist or <i>key</i> is specified, if <i>key</i> does not
                     exist in <i>record</i>. With <b>--if-exists</b>, a missing <i>record</i>
                     yields no output and a missing <i>key</i> prints a blank
                     line.

                     If <b>@</b><i>name</i> is specified, then the UUID for <i>record</i> may
                     be referred to by that name later in the same
                     <b>ovs-vsctl </b>invocation in contexts where a UUID is
                     expected.

                     Both <b>--id </b>and the <i>column</i> arguments are optional,
                     but usually at least one or the other should be
                     specified. If both are omitted, then <b>get </b>has no
                     effect except to verify that <i>record</i> exists in
                     <i>table</i>.

                     <b>--id </b>and <b>--if-exists </b>cannot be used together.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>set </b><i>table record column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]<b>=</b><i>value</i>...
                     Sets the value of each specified <i>column</i> in the
                     given <i>record</i> in <i>table</i> to <i>value</i>. For map columns, a
                     <i>key</i> may optionally be specified, in which case the
                     value associated with <i>key</i> in that column is changed
                     (or added, if none exists), instead of the entire
                     map.

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <i>record</i> does
                     not exist. With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does
                     nothing if <i>record</i> does not exist.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>add </b><i>table record column</i> [<i>key</i><b>=</b>]<i>value</i>...
                     Adds the specified value or key-value pair to
                     <i>column</i> in <i>record</i> in <i>table</i>. If <i>column</i> is a map, then
                     <i>key</i> is required, otherwise it is prohibited. If <i>key</i>
                     already exists in a map column, then the current
                     <i>value</i> is not replaced (use the <b>set </b>command to
                     replace an existing value).

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <i>record</i> does
                     not exist. With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does
                     nothing if <i>record</i> does not exist.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove </b><i>table record column value</i>...

                     [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove </b><i>table record column key</i>...

                     [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove </b><i>table record column</i>
                     <i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>...  Removes the specified values or key-
                     value pairs from <i>column</i> in <i>record</i> in <i>table</i>. The
                     first form applies to columns that are not maps:
                     each specified <i>value</i> is removed from the column.
                     The second and third forms apply to map columns: if
                     only a <i>key</i> is specified, then any key-value pair
                     with the given <i>key</i> is removed, regardless of its
                     value; if a <i>value</i> is given then a pair is removed
                     only if both key and value match.

                     It is not an error if the column does not contain
                     the specified key or value or pair.

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <i>record</i> does
                     not exist. With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does
                     nothing if <i>record</i> does not exist.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>clear </b><i>table record column</i>...
                     Sets each <i>column</i> in <i>record</i> in <i>table</i> to the empty
                     set or empty map, as appropriate. This command
                     applies only to columns that are allowed to be
                     empty.

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <i>record</i> does
                     not exist. With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does
                     nothing if <i>record</i> does not exist.

              [<b>--id=(@</b><i>name</i>|<i>uuid</i>)] <b>create </b><i>table column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]<b>=</b><i>value</i>...
                     Creates a new record in <i>table</i> and sets the initial
                     values of each <i>column</i>. Columns not explicitly set
                     will receive their default values. Outputs the UUID
                     of the new row.

                     If <b>@</b><i>name</i> is specified, then the UUID for the new
                     row may be referred to by that name elsewhere in
                     the same <b>\*(PN </b>invocation in contexts where a UUID
                     is expected. Such references may precede or follow
                     the <b>create </b>command.

                     If a valid <i>uuid</i> is specified, then it is used as
                     the UUID of the new row.

                     Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                            Records in the Open vSwitch database are
                            significant only when they can be reached
                            directly or indirectly from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b>
                            table. Except for records in the <b>QoS </b>or
                            <b>Queue </b>tables, records that are not reachable
                            from the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table are
                            automatically deleted from the database.
                            This deletion happens immediately, without
                            waiting for additional <b>ovs-vsctl </b>commands or
                            other database activity. Thus, a <b>create</b>
                            command must generally be accompanied by
                            additional commands <i>within the same</i>
                            <b>ovs-vsctl </b><i>invocation</i> to add a chain of
                            references to the newly created record from
                            the top-level <b>Open_vSwitch </b>record. The
                            <b>EXAMPLES </b>section gives some examples that
                            show how to do this.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>destroy </b><i>table record</i>...
                     Deletes each specified <i>record</i> from <i>table</i>. Unless
                     <b>--if-exists </b>is specified, each <i>record</i>s must exist.

              <b>--all destroy </b><i>table</i>
                     Deletes all records from the <i>table</i>.

                     Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                            The <b>destroy </b>command is only useful for
                            records in the <b>QoS </b>or <b>Queue </b>tables. Records
                            in other tables are automatically deleted
                            from the database when they become
                            unreachable from the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table.
                            This means that deleting the last reference
                            to a record is sufficient for deleting the
                            record itself. For records in these tables,
                            <b>destroy </b>is silently ignored. See the
                            <b>EXAMPLES </b>section below for more information.

              <b>wait-until </b><i>table record</i> [<i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]<b>=</b><i>value</i>]...
                     Waits until <i>table</i> contains a record named <i>record</i>
                     whose <i>column</i> equals <i>value</i> or, if <i>key</i> is specified,
                     whose <i>column</i> contains a <i>key</i> with the specified
                     <i>value</i>. This command supports the same operators and
                     semantics described for the <b>find </b>command above.

                     If no <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]<b>=</b><i>value</i> arguments are given, this
                     command waits only until <i>record</i> exists. If more
                     than one such argument is given, the command waits
                     until all of them are satisfied.

                     Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                            Usually <b>wait-until </b>should be placed at the
                            beginning of a set of <b>ovs-vsctl </b>commands.
                            For example, <b>wait-until bridge br0 -- get</b>
                            <b>bridge br0 datapath_id </b>waits until a bridge
                            named <b>br0 </b>is created, then prints its
                            <b>datapath_id </b>column, whereas <b>get bridge br0</b>
                            <b>datapath_id -- wait-until bridge br0 </b>will
                            abort if no bridge named <b>br0 </b>exists when
                            <b>ovs-vsctl </b>initially connects to the
                            database.

                     Consider specifying <b>--timeout=0 </b>along with
                     <b>--wait-until</b>, to prevent <b>ovs-vsctl </b>from terminating
                     after waiting only at most 5 seconds.

              <b>comment </b>[<i>arg</i>]...
                     This command has no effect on behavior, but any
                     database log record created by the command will
                     include the command and its arguments.

              Sets the SSL configuration.
</pre> <h2>
SYNCHRONIZATION COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       sync   Ordinarily, <b>--wait=sb </b>only waits for changes by the
              current <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>invocation to take effect. This means
              that, if none of the commands supplied to <b>ovn-ic-nbctl</b>
              change the database, then the command does not wait at
              all. With the <b>sync </b>command, however, <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>waits
              even for earlier changes to the database to propagate down
              to the southbound database, according to the argument of
              <b>--wait</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--no-wait </b>| <b>--wait=none</b>
       <b>--wait=sb</b>
            These options control whether and how <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>waits for
            the OVN system to become up-to-date with changes made in an
            <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>invocation.

            By default, or if <b>--no-wait </b>or <b>--wait=none</b>, <b>ovn-ic-nbctl</b>
            exits immediately after confirming that changes have been
            committed to the Interconnect northbound database, without
            waiting.

            With <b>--wait=sb</b>, before <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>exits, it waits for
            <b>ovn-ics </b>to bring the Interconnect southbound database up-to-
            date with the Interconnect northbound database updates.

            Ordinarily, <b>--wait=sb </b>only waits for changes by the current
            <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>invocation to take effect. This means that, if
            none of the commands supplied to <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>change the
            database, then the command does not wait at all. Use the
            <b>sync </b>command to override this behavior.

       <b>--db </b><i>database</i>
            The OVSDB database remote to contact. If the <b>OVN_IC_NB_DB</b>
            environment variable is set, its value is used as the
            default. Otherwise, the default is <b>unix:/ovn_ic_nb_db.sock</b>,
            but this default is unlikely to be useful outside of single-
            machine OVN test environments.

       <b>--leader-only</b>
       <b>--no-leader-only</b>
            By default, or with <b>--leader-only</b>, when the database server
            is a clustered database, <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>will avoid servers
            other than the cluster leader. This ensures that any data
            that <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>reads and reports is up-to-date. With
            <b>--no-leader-only</b>, <b>ovn-ic-nbctl </b>will use any server in the
            cluster, which means that for read-only transactions it can
            report and act on stale data (transactions that modify the
            database are always serialized even with <b>--no-leader-only</b>).
            Refer to <b>Understanding Cluster Consistency </b>in <a href="../man7/ovsdb.7.html">ovsdb(7)</a> for
            more information.
</pre> <h2>
LOGGING OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-v</b>[<i>spec</i>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<i>spec</i>]
            Sets logging levels. Without any <i>spec</i>, sets the log level
            for every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>. Otherwise, <i>spec</i> is
            a list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up
            to one from each category below:

            •      A valid module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b>
                   command on <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a>, limits the log level change
                   to the specified module.

            •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level
                   change to only to the system log, to the console, or
                   to a file, respectively. (If <b>--detach </b>is specified,
                   the daemon closes its standard file descriptors, so
                   logging to the console will have no effect.)

                   On Windows platform, <b>syslog </b>is accepted as a word and
                   is only useful along with the <b>--syslog-target </b>option
                   (the word has no effect otherwise).

            •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the
                   log level. Messages of the given severity or higher
                   will be logged, and messages of lower severity will
                   be filtered out. <b>off </b>filters out all messages. See
                   <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a definition of each log level.

            Case is not significant within <i>spec</i>.

            Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a file
            will not take place unless <b>--log-file </b>is also specified (see
            below).

            For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any </b>is
            accepted as a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
            Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
            <b>--verbose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
            Sets the log pattern for <i>destination</i> to <i>pattern</i>. Refer to
            <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a description of the valid syntax for
            <i>pattern</i>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><i>facility</i>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><i>facility</i>
            Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. <i>facility</i> can
            be one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>,
            <b>uucp</b>, <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>,
            <b>local2</b>, <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6 </b>or <b>local7</b>. If this
            option is not specified, <b>daemon </b>is used as the default for
            the local system syslog and <b>local0 </b>is used while sending a
            message to the target provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b>
            option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
            Enables logging to a file. If <i>file</i> is specified, then it is
            used as the exact name for the log file. The default log
            file name used if <i>file</i> is omitted is
            <b>/usr/local/var/log/ovn/</b><i>program</i><b>.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><i>host</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>
            Send syslog messages to UDP <i>port</i> on <i>host</i>, in addition to the
            system syslog. The <i>host</i> must be a numerical IP address, not
            a hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><i>method</i>
            Specify <i>method</i> as how syslog messages should be sent to
            syslog daemon. The following forms are supported:

            •      <b>libc</b>, to use the libc <b>syslog() </b>function. Downside of
                   using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to
                   every message before it is actually sent to the
                   syslog daemon over <b>/dev/log </b>UNIX domain socket.

            •      <b>unix:</b><i>file</i>, to use a UNIX domain socket directly. It
                   is possible to specify arbitrary message format with
                   this option. However, <b>rsyslogd 8.9 </b>and older versions
                   use hard coded parser function anyway that limits
                   UNIX domain socket use. If you want to use arbitrary
                   message format with older <b>rsyslogd </b>versions, then use
                   UDP socket to localhost IP address instead.

            •      <b>udp:</b><i>ip</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>, to use a UDP socket. With this method it
                   is possible to use arbitrary message format also with
                   older <b>rsyslogd</b>. When sending syslog messages over UDP
                   socket extra precaution needs to be taken into
                   account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be
                   configured to listen on the specified UDP port,
                   accidental iptables rules could be interfering with
                   local syslog traffic and there are some security
                   considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do not
                   apply to UNIX domain sockets.

            •      <b>null</b>, to discard all messages logged to syslog.

            The default is taken from the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD </b>environment
            variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

TABLE FORMATTING OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       These options control the format of output from the <b>list </b>and <b>find</b>
       commands.

              <b>-f </b><i>format</i>
              <b>--format=</b><i>format</i>
                   Sets the type of table formatting. The following
                   types of <i>format</i> are available:

                   <b>table  </b>2-D text tables with aligned columns.

                   <b>list </b>(default)
                          A list with one column per line and rows
                          separated by a blank line.

                   <b>html   </b>HTML tables.

                   <b>csv    </b>Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.

                   <b>json   </b>JSON format as defined in RFC 4627. The output
                          is a sequence of JSON objects, each of which
                          corresponds to one table. Each JSON object has
                          the following members with the noted values:

                          <b>caption</b>
                                 The table’s caption. This member is
                                 omitted if the table has no caption.

                          <b>headings</b>
                                 An array with one element per table
                                 column. Each array element is a string
                                 giving the corresponding column’s
                                 heading.

                          <b>data   </b>An array with one element per table
                                 row. Each element is also an array with
                                 one element per table column. The
                                 elements of this second-level array are
                                 the cells that constitute the table.
                                 Cells that represent OVSDB data or data
                                 types are expressed in the format
                                 described in the OVSDB specification;
                                 other cells are simply expressed as
                                 text strings.

              <b>-d </b><i>format</i>
              <b>--data=</b><i>format</i>
                   Sets the formatting for cells within output tables
                   unless the table format is set to <b>json</b>, in which case
                   <b>json </b>formatting is always used when formatting cells.
                   The following types of <i>format</i> are available:

                   <b>string </b>(default)
                          The simple format described in the <b>Database</b>
                          <b>Values </b>section of <a href="ovs-vsctl.8.html">ovs-vsctl(8)</a>.

                   <b>bare   </b>The simple format with punctuation stripped
                          off: <b>[] </b>and <b>{} </b>are omitted around sets, maps,
                          and empty columns, items within sets and maps
                          are space-separated, and strings are never
                          quoted. This format may be easier for scripts
                          to parse.

                   <b>json   </b>The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.

              <b>--no-headings</b>
                   This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise
                   appears in the first row of table output.

              <b>--pretty</b>
                   By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as
                   possible. This option causes JSON in output to be
                   printed in a more readable fashion. Members of
                   objects and elements of arrays are printed one per
                   line, with indentation.

                   This option does not affect JSON in tables, which is
                   always printed compactly.

              <b>--bare</b>
                   Equivalent to <b>--format=list --data=bare</b>
                   <b>--no-headings</b>.

   <b>PKI Options</b>
       PKI configuration is required to use SSL for the connection to
       the database.

              <b>-p </b><i>privkey.pem</i>
              <b>--private-key=</b><i>privkey.pem</i>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used
                   as identity for outgoing SSL connections.

              <b>-c </b><i>cert.pem</i>
              <b>--certificate=</b><i>cert.pem</i>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that
                   certifies the private key specified on <b>-p </b>or
                   <b>--private-key </b>to be trustworthy. The certificate must
                   be signed by the certificate authority (CA) that the
                   peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.

              <b>-C </b><i>cacert.pem</i>
              <b>--ca-cert=</b><i>cacert.pem</i>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate
                   for verifying certificates presented to this program
                   by SSL peers. (This may be the same certificate that
                   SSL peers use to verify the certificate specified on
                   <b>-c </b>or <b>--certificate</b>, or it may be a different one,
                   depending on the PKI design in use.)

              <b>-C none</b>
              <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
                   Disables verification of certificates presented by
                   SSL peers. This introduces a security risk, because
                   it means that certificates cannot be verified to be
                   those of known trusted hosts.

              <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><i>cacert.pem</i>
                     When <i>cacert.pem</i> exists, this option has the same
                     effect as <b>-C </b>or <b>--ca-cert</b>. If it does not exist,
                     then the executable will attempt to obtain the CA
                     certificate from the SSL peer on its first SSL
                     connection and save it to the named PEM file. If it
                     is successful, it will immediately drop the
                     connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL
                     connections must be authenticated by a certificate
                     signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.

                     This option exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-
                     the-middle attack obtaining the initial CA
                     certificate, but it may be useful for
                     bootstrapping.

                     This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends
                     its CA certificate as part of the SSL certificate
                     chain. The SSL protocol does not require the server
                     to send the CA certificate.

                     This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C </b>and
                     <b>--ca-cert</b>.

   <b>Other Options</b>
       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b>
            Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
            Prints version information to the console.
