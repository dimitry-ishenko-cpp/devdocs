NAME </h2>
<pre>
       automount - manage autofs mount points
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>automount </b>[<i>options</i>] [<i>master_map</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>automount </b>program is used to manage mount points for autofs,
       the inlined Linux automounter.  <b>automount </b>works by reading the
       <a href="../man5/auto.master.5.html">auto.master(5)</a> map and sets up mount points for each entry in the
       master map allowing them to be automatically mounted when ac‐
       cessed. The file systems are then automatically umounted after a
       period of inactivity.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>-h, --help</i>
              Print brief help on program usage.

       <i>-p, --pid-file</i>
              Write the pid of the daemon to the specified file.

       <i>-t &lt;seconds&gt;, --timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</i>
              Set the global minimum timeout, in seconds, until directo‐
              ries are unmounted. The default is 10 minutes. Setting the
              timeout to zero disables umounts completely.  The internal
              program default is 10 minutes, but the default installed
              configuration overrides this and sets the timeout to 5
              minutes to be consistent with earlier autofs releases.

       <i>-M &lt;seconds&gt;, --master-wait &lt;seconds&gt;</i>
              Set the maximum time to wait for the master map to become
              available if it cannot be read at program start.

       <i>-n &lt;seconds&gt;, --negative-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</i>
              Set the default timeout for caching failed key lookups.
              The default is 60 seconds.

       <i>-v, --verbose</i>
              Enables logging of general status and progress messages
              for all autofs managed mounts.

       <b>-d</b>[<i>LEVEL</i>], <b>--debug</b>[=<i>LEVEL</i>]
              Enables logging of general status and progress messages as
              well as debugging messages for all autofs managed mounts.
              The default <i>LEVEL</i> is 0.  automounter must perform OpenLDAP
              authenticated binds for optional argument <i>LEVEL</i> to have
              any effect. OpenLDAP uses a bitmap to enable debugging for
              specific components. Debug <i>LEVEL</i>=0 disables libldap deug‐
              ging.  For further details see <a href="slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a>.

       <i>-Dvariable=value, --define variable=value</i>
              Define a global macro substitution variable. Global defin‐
              itions are over-ridden macro definitions of the same name
              specified in mount entries.

       <i>-S, --systemd-service</i>
              Used when running the automounter as a systemd service to
              ensure log entry format is consistent with the log entry
              format when running as a daemon.

       <i>-f, --foreground</i>
              Run the daemon in the foreground and log to stderr instead
              of syslog."

       <i>-r, --random-multimount-selection</i>
              Enables the use of random selection when choosing a host
              from a list of replicated servers.

       <i>-m, --dumpmaps [&lt;map type&gt; &lt;map name&gt;]</i>
              With no parameters, list information about the configured
              automounter maps, then exit.

              If the dumpmaps option is given and is followed by two pa‐
              rameters, "&lt;map type&gt; &lt;map name&gt;" then simple "&lt;key, val‐
              ue&gt;" pairs that would be read in by a map read are printed
              to stdout if the given map type and map name are found in
              the map configuration.

              If the map is an LDAP map and there is more than one map
              of same name in different base dns only the first map en‐
              countered by autofs will be listed. Similarly, if the map
              is a file map and there is more than one map of the same
              name in different directories, only the first map encoun‐
              tered will be listed.

              If the map type is an old style multi-map and any one of
              the map names in the multi-map entry matches the given map
              name the entries that would be used by autofs for the
              whole multi-map will be listed.

       <i>-O, --global-options</i>
              Allows the specification of global mount options used for
              all master map entries. These options will either replace
              or be appended to options given in a master map entry de‐
              pending on the APPEND_OPTIONS configuration setting.

       <i>-V, --version</i>
              Display the version number, then exit.

       <i>-l, --set-log-priority priority path [path,...]</i>
              Set the daemon log priority to the specified value.  Valid
              values include the numbers 0-7, or the strings emerg,
              alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, or debug. Log
              level debug will log everything, log levels info, warn (or
              warning), or notice with enable the daemon verbose log‐
              ging. Any other level will set basic logging. Note that
              enabling debug or verbose logging in the autofs global
              configuration will override dynamic log level changes. For
              example, if verbose logging is set in the configuration
              then attempting to set logging to basic logging, by using
              alert, crit, err or emerg won't stop the verbose logging.
              However, setting logging to debug will lead to everything
              (debug logging) being logged witch can then also be dis‐
              abled, returning the daemon to verbose logging. This op‐
              tion can be specified to change the logging priority of an
              already running automount process.

              The <i>path</i> argument corresponds to the automounted path name
              as specified in the master map.

       <i>-C, --dont-check-daemon</i>
              Don't check if the daemon is currently running (see
              NOTES).

       <i>-F, --force</i>
              Force an unlink umount of existing mounts under configured
              autofs managed mount points during startup. This can cause
              problems for processes with working directories within
              these mounts (see NOTES).

       <i>-U, --force-exit</i>
              Force an unlink umount of existing mounts under configured
              autofs managed mount points and exit rather than continu‐
              ing the startup. This can cause problems for processes
              with working directories within these mounts (see NOTES).
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>automount </b>takes one optional argument, the name of the master map
       to use.

       <b>master_map</b>
              Location for autofs master map that defines autofs managed
              mount points and the mount maps they will use. The default
              is <b>auto.master</b>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>automount </b>daemon catches a USR1 signal, it will umount all
       currently unused autofs managed mounted file systems and continue
       running (forced expire).  If it catches the TERM signal it will
       umount all unused autofs managed mounted file systems and exit if
       there are no remaining busy file systems. If autofs has been com‐
       piled with the option to ignore busy mounts on exit it will exit
       leaving any busy mounts in place otherwise busy file systems will
       not be umounted and autofs will not exit.  Alternatively, if aut‐
       ofs has been compiled with the option to enable forced shutdown
       then a USR2 signal to the daemon will cause all mounts to be
       umounted and any busy mounts to be forcibly umounted, including
       autofs mount point directories (summary execution). Note that the
       forced umount is an unlink operation and the actual umount will
       not happen in the kernel until active file handles are released.
       The daemon also responds to a HUP signal which triggers an update
       of the maps for each mount point.

       If any autofs mount point directories are busy when the daemon is
       sent an exit signal the daemon will not exit. The exception to
       this is if autofs has been built with configure options to either
       ignore busy mounts at exit or force umount at exit. If the ignore
       busy mounts at exit option is used the filesystems will be left
       in a catatonic (non-functional) state and can be manually umount‐
       ed when they become unused. If the force umount at exit option is
       used the filesystems will be umounted but the mount will not be
       released by the kernel until they are no longer in use by the
       processes that held them busy.  If automount managed filesystems
       are found mounted when autofs is started they will be recovered
       unless they are no longer present in the map in which case they
       need to umounted manually.

       If the option to disable the check to see if the daemon is al‐
       ready running is used be aware that autofs currently may not
       function correctly for certain types of automount maps. The
       mounts of the separate daemons might interfere with one another.
       The implications of running multiple daemon instances needs to be
       checked and tested before we can say this is supported.

       If the option to force an unlink of mounts at startup is used
       then processes whose working directory is within unlinked auto‐
       mounted directories will not get the correct pwd from the system.
       This is because, after the mount is unlinked from the mount tree,
       anything that needs to walk back up the mount tree to construct a
       path, such as getcwd(2) and the proc filesystem /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/cwd,
       cannot work because the point from which the path is constructed
       has been detached from the mount tree.
