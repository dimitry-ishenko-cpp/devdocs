NAME </h2>

       systemd-storagetm.service, systemd-storagetm - Exposes all local
       block devices as NVMe-TCP mass storage devices
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-storagetm.service

       <b>/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-storagetm </b>[OPTIONS...] [<i>DEVICE</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-storagetm.service is a service that exposes all local
       block devices as NVMe-TCP mass storage devices. Its primary
       use-case is to be invoked by the storage-target-mode.target unit
       that can be booted into.

           <b>Warning</b>

           The NVMe disks are currently exposed without authentication
           or encryption, in read/write mode. This means network peers
           may read from and write to the device without any
           restrictions. This functionality should hence only be used in
           a local setup.

       Note that to function properly networking must be configured too.
       The recommended mechanism to boot into a storage target mode is
       by adding "rd.systemd.unit=storage-target-mode.target
       ip=link-local" on the kernel command line. Note that
       "ip=link-local" only configures link-local IP, i.e. IPv4LL and
       IPv6LL, which means non-routable addresses. This is done for
       security reasons, so that only systems on the local link can
       access the devices. Use "ip=dhcp" to assign routable addresses
       too. For further details see
       <a href="systemd-network-generator.service.8.html">systemd-network-generator.service(8)</a>.

       Unless the <b>--all </b>switch is used expects one or more block devices
       or regular files to expose via NVMe-TCP as argument.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--nqn=</b>
           Takes a string. If specified configures the NVMe Qualified
           Name to use for the exposed NVMe-TCP mass storage devices.
           The NQN should follow the syntax described in <b>NVM Express</b>
           <b>Base Specification 2.0c</b>[1], section 4.5 "NVMe Qualified
           Names". Note that the NQN specified here will be suffixed
           with a dot and the block device name before it is exposed on
           the NVMe target. If not specified defaults to
           "nqn.2023-10.io.systemd:storagetm.<i>ID</i>", where ID is replaced
           by a 128bit ID derived from <a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a>.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--all</b>, <b>-a</b>
           If specified exposes all local block devices via NVMe-TCP,
           current and future (i.e. it watches block devices come and go
           and updates the NVMe-TCP list as needed). Note that by
           default any block devices that originate on the same block
           device as the block device backing the current root file
           system are excluded. If the switch is specified twice this
           safety mechanism is disabled.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.
