DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>police </b>action allows limiting of the byte or packet rate of
       traffic matched by the filter it is attached to.

       There are two different algorithms available to measure the byte
       rate: The first one uses an internal dual token bucket and is
       configured using the <b>rate</b>, <b>burst</b>, <b>mtu</b>, <b>peakrate</b>, <b>overhead </b>and
       <b>linklayer </b>parameters. The second one uses an in-kernel sampling
       mechanism. It can be fine-tuned using the <b>estimator </b>filter
       parameter.

       There is one algorithm available to measure packet rate and it is
       similar to the first algorithm described for byte rate. It is
       configured using the <b>pkt_rate </b>and <b>pkt_burst </b>parameters.

       At least one of the <b>rate </b>and <b>pkt_rate </b>parameters must be
       configured.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>rate </b><i>RATE</i>
              The maximum byte rate of packets passing this action.
              Those exceeding it will be treated as defined by the
              <b>conform-exceed </b>option.

       <b>burst </b><i>BYTES</i>[<b>/</b><i>BYTES</i>]
              Set the maximum allowed burst in bytes, optionally
              followed by a slash ('/') sign and cell size which must be
              a power of 2.

       <b>pkt_rate </b><i>RATE</i>
              The maximum packet rate or packets passing this action.
              Those exceeding it will be treated as defined by the
              <b>conform-exceed </b>option.

       <b>pkt_burst </b><i>PACKETS</i>
              Set the maximum allowed burst in packets.

       <b>mtu </b><i>BYTES</i>[<b>/</b><i>BYTES</i>]
              This is the maximum packet size handled by the policer
              (larger ones will be handled like they exceeded the
              configured rate). Setting this value correctly will
              improve the scheduler's precision.  Value formatting is
              identical to <b>burst </b>above. Defaults to unlimited.

       <b>peakrate </b><i>RATE</i>
              Set the maximum bucket depletion rate, exceeding <b>rate</b>.

       <b>avrate </b><i>RATE</i>
              Make use of an in-kernel bandwidth rate estimator and
              match the given <i>RATE</i> against it.

       <b>overhead </b><i>BYTES</i>
              Account for protocol overhead of encapsulating output
              devices when computing <b>rate </b>and <b>peakrate</b>.

       <b>linklayer </b><i>TYPE</i>
              Specify the link layer type.  <i>TYPE</i> may be one of <b>ethernet</b>
              (the default), <b>atm </b>or <b>adsl </b>(which are synonyms). It is
              used to align the precomputed rate tables to ATM cell
              sizes, for <b>ethernet </b>no action is taken.

       <b>estimator </b><i>SAMPLE AVERAGE</i>
              Fine-tune the in-kernel packet rate estimator.  <i>SAMPLE</i> and
              <i>AVERAGE</i> are time values and control the frequency in which
              samples are taken and over what timespan an average is
              built.

       <b>conform-exceed </b><i>EXCEEDACT</i>[<b>/</b><i>NOTEXCEEDACT</i>]
              Define how to handle packets which exceed or conform the
              configured bandwidth limit. Possible values are:

              continue
                     Don't do anything, just continue with the next
                     action in line.

              drop   Drop the packet immediately.

              shot   This is a synonym to <b>drop</b>.

              ok     Accept the packet. This is the default for
                     conforming packets.

              pass   This is a synonym to <b>ok</b>.

              reclassify
                     Treat the packet as non-matching to the filter this
                     action is attached to and continue with the next
                     filter in line (if any). This is the default for
                     exceeding packets.

              pipe   Pass the packet to the next action in line.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       A typical application of the police action is to enforce ingress
       traffic rate by dropping exceeding packets. Although better done
       on the sender's side, especially in scenarios with lack of peer
       control (e.g. with dial-up providers) this is often the best one
       can do in order to keep latencies low under high load. The
       following establishes input bandwidth policing to 1mbit/s using
       the <b>ingress </b>qdisc and <b>u32 </b>filter:

              # tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle ffff: ingress
              # tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
                   match u32 0 0 \
                   police rate 1mbit burst 100k

       As an action can not live on it's own, there always has to be a
       filter involved as link between qdisc and action. The example
       above uses <b>u32 </b>for that, which is configured to effectively match
       any packet (passing it to the <b>police </b>action thereby).
