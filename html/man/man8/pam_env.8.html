NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_env - PAM module to set/unset environment variables
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_env.so </b>[debug] [conffile=<i>conf-file</i>] [envfile=<i>env-file</i>]
                  [readenv=<i>0|1</i>] [user_envfile=<i>env-file</i>]
                  [user_readenv=<i>0|1</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_env PAM module allows the (un)setting of environment
       variables. Supported is the use of previously set environment
       variables as well as <i>PAM_ITEM</i>s such as <i>PAM_RHOST</i>.

       By default rules for (un)setting of variables are taken from the
       config file /etc/security/pam_env.conf. An alternate file can be
       specified with the <i>conffile</i> option.

       Second a file (/etc/environment by default) with simple <i>KEY=VAL</i>
       pairs on separate lines will be read. With the <i>envfile</i> option an
       alternate file can be specified. And with the <i>readenv</i> option this
       can be completely disabled.

       Third it will read a user configuration file
       ($HOME/.pam_environment by default). The default file can be
       changed with the <i>user_envfile</i> option and it can be turned on and
       off with the <i>user_readenv</i> option.

       Since setting of PAM environment variables can have side effects
       to other modules, this module should be the last one on the
       stack.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>conffile=</b><i>/path/to/pam_env.conf</i>
           Indicate an alternative pam_env.conf style configuration file
           to override the default. This can be useful when different
           services need different environments.

       <b>debug</b>
           A lot of debug information is printed with <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.

       <b>envfile=</b><i>/path/to/environment</i>
           Indicate an alternative environment file to override the
           default. The syntax are simple <i>KEY=VAL</i> pairs on separate
           lines. The <i>export</i> instruction can be specified for bash
           compatibility, but will be ignored. This can be useful when
           different services need different environments.

       <b>readenv=</b><i>0|1</i>
           Turns on or off the reading of the file specified by envfile
           (0 is off, 1 is on). By default this option is on.

       <b>user_envfile=</b><i>filename</i>
           Indicate an alternative .pam_environment file to override the
           default.The syntax is the same as for
           <i>/etc/security/pam_env.conf</i>. The filename is relative to the
           user home directory. This can be useful when different
           services need different environments.

       <b>user_readenv=</b><i>0|1</i>
           Turns on or off the reading of the user specific environment
           file. 0 is off, 1 is on. By default this option is off as
           user supplied environment variables in the PAM environment
           could affect behavior of subsequent modules in the stack
           without the consent of the system administrator.

           Due to problematic security this functionality is deprecated
           since the 1.5.0 version and will be removed completely at
           some point in the future.
