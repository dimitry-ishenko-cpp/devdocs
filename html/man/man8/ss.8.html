</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ss - another utility to investigate sockets
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ss </b>[<i>options</i>] <i>[ FILTER ]</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ss </b>is used to dump socket statistics. It allows showing
       information similar to <i>netstat</i>.  It can display more TCP and
       state information than other tools.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       When no option is used ss displays a list of open non-listening
       sockets (e.g. TCP/UNIX/UDP) that have established connection.

       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Show summary of options.

       <b>-V, --version</b>
              Output version information.

       <b>-H, --no-header</b>
              Suppress header line.

       <b>-Q, --no-queues</b>
              Suppress sending and receiving queue columns.

       <b>-O, --oneline</b>
              Print each socket's data on a single line.

       <b>-n, --numeric</b>
              Do not try to resolve service names. Show exact bandwidth
              values, instead of human-readable.

       <b>-r, --resolve</b>
              Try to resolve numeric address/ports.

       <b>-a, --all</b>
              Display both listening and non-listening (for TCP this
              means established connections) sockets.

       <b>-l, --listening</b>
              Display only listening sockets (these are omitted by
              default).

       <b>-B, --bound-inactive</b>
              Display only TCP bound but inactive (not listening,
              connecting, etc.) sockets (these are omitted by default).

       <b>-o, --options</b>
              Show timer information. For TCP protocol, the output
              format is:

              timer:(&lt;timer_name&gt;,&lt;expire_time&gt;,&lt;retrans&gt;)

              <b>&lt;timer_name&gt;</b>

                     this shows priority set by SO_PRIORITY.

       <b>--cgroup</b>
              Show cgroup information. Below fields may appear:

              <b>cgroup </b>Cgroup v2 pathname. This pathname is relative to
                     the mount point of the hierarchy.

       <b>--tipcinfo</b>
              Show internal tipc socket information.

       <b>-K, --kill</b>
              Attempts to forcibly close sockets. This option displays
              sockets that are successfully closed and silently skips
              sockets that the kernel does not support closing. It
              supports IPv4 and IPv6 sockets only.

       <b>-s, --summary</b>
              Print summary statistics. This option does not parse
              socket lists obtaining summary from various sources. It is
              useful when amount of sockets is so huge that parsing
              /proc/net/tcp is painful.

       <b>-E, --events</b>
              Continually display sockets as they are destroyed

       <b>-Z, --context</b>
              As the <b>-p </b>option but also shows process security context.
              If the <b>-T </b>option is used, also shows thread security
              context.

              For <a href="../man7/netlink.7.html">netlink(7)</a> sockets the initiating process context is
              displayed as follows:

                     1.  If valid pid show the process context.

                     2.  If destination is kernel (pid = 0) show kernel
                         initial context.

                     3.  If a unique identifier has been allocated by
                         the kernel or netlink user, show context as
                         "unavailable". This will generally indicate
                         that a process has more than one netlink socket
                         active.

       <b>-z, --contexts</b>
              As the <b>-Z </b>option but also shows the socket context. The
              socket context is taken from the associated inode and is
              not the actual socket context held by the kernel. Sockets
              are typically labeled with the context of the creating
              process, however the context shown will reflect any policy
              role, type and/or range transition rules applied, and is
              therefore a useful reference.

       <b>-N NSNAME, --net=NSNAME</b>
              Switch to the specified network namespace name.

       <b>-b, --bpf</b>
              Show socket classic BPF filters (only administrators are
              allowed to get these information).

       <b>-4, --ipv4</b>
              Display only IP version 4 sockets (alias for -f inet).

       <b>-6, --ipv6</b>
              Display only IP version 6 sockets (alias for -f inet6).

       <b>-0, --packet</b>
              Display PACKET sockets (alias for -f link).

       <b>-t, --tcp</b>
              Display TCP sockets.

       <b>-u, --udp</b>
              Display UDP sockets.

       <b>-d, --dccp</b>
              Display DCCP sockets.

       <b>-w, --raw</b>
              Display RAW sockets.

       <b>-x, --unix</b>
              Display Unix domain sockets (alias for -f unix).

       <b>-S, --sctp</b>
              Display SCTP sockets.

       <b>--tipc </b>Display tipc sockets (alias for -f tipc).

       <b>--vsock</b>
              Display vsock sockets (alias for -f vsock).

       <b>--xdp  </b>Display XDP sockets (alias for -f xdp).

       <b>-M, --mptcp</b>
              Display MPTCP sockets.

       <b>--inet-sockopt</b>
              Display inet socket options.

       <b>-f FAMILY, --family=FAMILY</b>
              Display sockets of type FAMILY.  Currently the following
              families are supported: unix, inet, inet6, link, netlink,
              vsock, tipc, xdp.

       <b>-A QUERY, --query=QUERY, --socket=QUERY</b>
              List of socket tables to dump, separated by commas. The
              following identifiers are understood: all, inet, tcp, udp,
              raw, unix, packet, netlink, unix_dgram, unix_stream,
              unix_seqpacket, packet_raw, packet_dgram, dccp, sctp,
              tipc, vsock_stream, vsock_dgram, xdp, mptcp. Any item in
              the list may optionally be prefixed by an exclamation mark
              (<b>!</b>)  to exclude that socket table from being dumped.

       <b>-D FILE, --diag=FILE</b>
              Do not display anything, just dump raw information about
              TCP sockets to FILE after applying filters. If FILE is -
              stdout is used.

       <b>-F FILE, --filter=FILE</b>
              Read filter information from FILE.  Each line of FILE is
              interpreted like single command line option. If FILE is -
              stdin is used.

       <b>--bpf-maps</b>
              Pretty-print all the BPF socket-local data entries for
              each socket.

       <b>--bpf-map-id=MAP_ID</b>
              Pretty-print the BPF socket-local data entries for the
              requested map ID. Can be used more than once.

       <b>FILTER := [ state STATE-FILTER ] [ EXPRESSION ]</b>
              Please take a look at the official documentation for
              details regarding filters.
</pre> <h2>
STATE-FILTER </h2>
<pre>
       <b>STATE-FILTER </b>allows one to construct arbitrary set of states to
       match. Its syntax is sequence of keywords state and exclude
       followed by identifier of state.

       Available identifiers are:

              All standard TCP states: <b>established</b>, <b>syn-sent</b>, <b>syn-recv</b>,
              <b>fin-wait-1</b>, <b>fin-wait-2</b>, <b>time-wait</b>, <b>closed</b>, <b>close-wait</b>,
              <b>last-ack</b>, <b>listening </b>and <b>closing.</b>

              <b>all </b>- for all the states

              <b>connected </b>- all the states except for <b>listening </b>and <b>closed</b>

              <b>synchronized </b>- all the <b>connected </b>states except for <b>syn-</b>
              <b>sent</b>

              <b>bucket </b>- states, which are maintained as minisockets, i.e.
              <b>time-wait </b>and <b>syn-recv</b>

              <b>big </b>- opposite to <b>bucket</b>

              <b>bound-inactive </b>- bound but otherwise inactive sockets (not
              listening, connecting, etc.)
</pre> <h2>
EXPRESSION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EXPRESSION </b>allows filtering based on specific criteria.
       <b>EXPRESSION </b>consists of a series of predicates combined by boolean
       operators. The possible operators in increasing order of
       precedence are <b>or </b>(or | or ||), <b>and </b>(or &amp; or &amp;&amp;), and <b>not </b>(or !).
       If no operator is between consecutive predicates, an implicit <b>and</b>
       operator is assumed. Subexpressions can be grouped with "(" and
       ")".

       The following predicates are supported:

       <b>{dst|src} [=] HOST</b>
              Test if the destination or source matches HOST. See HOST
              SYNTAX for details.

       <b>{dport|sport} [OP] [FAMILY:]:PORT</b>
              Compare the destination or source port to PORT. OP can be
              any of "&lt;", "&lt;=", "=", "!=", "&gt;=" and "&gt;". Following
              normal arithmetic rules. FAMILY and PORT are as described
              in HOST SYNTAX below.

       <b>dev [=|!=] DEVICE</b>
              Match based on the device the connection uses. DEVICE can
              either be a device name or the index of the interface.

       <b>fwmark [=|!=] MASK</b>
              Matches based on the fwmark value for the connection. This
              can either be a specific mark value or a mark value
              followed by a "/" and a bitmask of which bits to use in
              the comparison. For example "fwmark = 0x01/0x03" would
              match if the two least significant bits of the fwmark were
              0x01.

       <b>cgroup [=|!=] PATH</b>
              Match if the connection is part of a cgroup at the given
              path.

       <b>autobound</b>
              Match if the port or path of the source address was
              automatically allocated (rather than explicitly
              specified).

       Most operators have aliases. If no operator is supplied "=" is
       assumed.  Each of the following groups of operators are all
       equivalent:

              • = == eq

              • != ne neq

              • &gt; gt

              • &lt; lt

              • &gt;= ge geq

              • &lt;= le leq

              • ! not

              • | || or

HOST SYNTAX </h2>
<pre>
       The general host syntax is [FAMILY:]ADDRESS[:PORT].

       FAMILY must be one of the families supported by the -f option. If
       not given it defaults to the family given with the -f option, and
       if that is also missing, will assume either inet or inet6. Note
       that all host conditions in the expression should either all be
       the same family or be only inet and inet6. If there is some other
       mixture of families, the results will probably be unexpected.

       The form of ADDRESS and PORT depends on the family used. "*" can
       be used as a wildcard for either the address or port. The details
       for each family are as follows:

       <b>unix   </b>ADDRESS is a glob pattern (see <a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch(3)</a>) that will be
              matched case-insensitively against the unix socket's
              address. Both path and abstract names are supported. Unix
              addresses do not support a port, and "*" cannot be used as
              a wildcard.

       <b>link   </b>ADDRESS is the case-insensitive name of an Ethernet
              protocol to match. PORT is either a device name or a
              device index for the desired link device, as seen in the
              output of ip link.

       <b>netlink</b>
              ADDRESS is a descriptor of the netlink family. Possible
              values come from /etc/iproute2/nl_protos. PORT is the port
              id of the socket, which is usually the same as the owning
              process id. The value "kernel" can be used to represent
              the kernel (port id of 0).

       <b>vsock  </b>ADDRESS is an integer representing the CID address, and
              PORT is the port.

       <b>inet </b>and <b>inet6</b>
              ADDRESS is an ip address (either v4 or v6 depending on the
              family) or a DNS hostname that resolves to an ip address
              of the required version. An ipv6 address must be enclosed
              in "[" and "]" to disambiguate the port separator. The
              address may additionally have a prefix length given in
              CIDR notation (a slash followed by the prefix length in
              bits). PORT is either the numerical socket port, or the
              service name for the port to match.
