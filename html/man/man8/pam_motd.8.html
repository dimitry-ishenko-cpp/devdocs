NAME </h2>

       pam_motd - Display the motd file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_motd.so </b>[motd=<i>/path/filename</i>] [motd_dir=<i>/path/dirname.d</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       pam_motd is a PAM module that can be used to display arbitrary
       motd (message of the day) files after a successful login. By
       default, pam_motd shows files in the following locations:

           /etc/motd
           /run/motd
           /usr/lib/motd
           /etc/motd.d/
           /run/motd.d/
           /usr/lib/motd.d/

       Each message size is limited to 64KB.

       If /etc/motd does not exist, then /run/motd is shown. If
       /run/motd does not exist, then /usr/lib/motd is shown.

       Similar overriding behavior applies to the directories. Files in
       /etc/motd.d/ override files with the same name in /run/motd.d/
       and /usr/lib/motd.d/. Files in /run/motd.d/ override files with
       the same name in /usr/lib/motd.d/.

       Files in the directories listed above are displayed in
       lexicographic order by name. Moreover, the files are filtered by
       reading them with the credentials of the target user
       authenticating on the system.

       To silence a message, a symbolic link with target /dev/null may
       be placed in /etc/motd.d with the same filename as the message to
       be silenced. Example: Creating a symbolic link as follows
       silences /usr/lib/motd.d/my_motd.

       <b>ln -s /dev/null /etc/motd.d/my_motd</b>

       The <b>MOTD_SHOWN=pam </b>environment variable is set after showing the
       motd files, even when all of them were silenced using symbolic
       links.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>motd=</b><i>/path/filename</i>
           The /path/filename file is displayed as message of the day.
           Multiple paths to try can be specified as a colon-separated
           list. By default this option is set to
           /etc/motd:/run/motd:/usr/lib/motd.

       <b>motd_dir=</b><i>/path/dirname.d</i>
           The /path/dirname.d directory is scanned and each file
           contained inside of it is displayed. Multiple directories to
           scan can be specified as a colon-separated list. By default
           this option is set to
           /etc/motd.d:/run/motd.d:/usr/lib/motd.d.

       When no options are given, the default behavior applies for both
       options. Specifying either option (or both) will disable the
       default behavior for both options.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED </h2>
<pre>
       Only the <b>session </b>module type is provided.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_ABORT
           Not all relevant data or options could be obtained.

       PAM_BUF_ERR
           Memory buffer error.

       PAM_IGNORE

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The suggested usage for /etc/pam.d/login is:

           session  optional  pam_motd.so

       To use a motd file from a different location:

           session  optional  pam_motd.so motd=/elsewhere/motd

       To use a motd file from elsewhere, along with a corresponding .d
       directory:

           session  optional  pam_motd.so motd=/elsewhere/motd motd_dir=/elsewhere/motd.d
