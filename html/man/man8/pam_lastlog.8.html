NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_lastlog - PAM module to display date of last login and
       perform inactive account lock out
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_lastlog.so </b>[debug] [silent] [never] [nodate] [nohost]
                      [noterm] [nowtmp] [noupdate] [showfailed]
                      [inactive=&lt;days&gt;] [unlimited]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       pam_lastlog is a PAM module to display a line of information
       about the last login of the user. In addition, the module
       maintains the /var/log/lastlog file.

       Some applications may perform this function themselves. In such
       cases, this module is not necessary.

       The module checks <b>LASTLOG_UID_MAX </b>option in /etc/login.defs and
       does not update or display last login records for users with UID
       higher than its value. If the option is not present or its value
       is invalid, no user ID limit is applied.

       If the module is called in the auth or account phase, the
       accounts that were not used recently enough will be disallowed to
       log in. The check is not performed for the root account so the
       root is never locked out. It is also not performed for users with
       UID higher than the <b>LASTLOG_UID_MAX </b>value.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debug</b>
           Print debug information.

       <b>silent</b>
           Don't inform the user about any previous login, just update
           the /var/log/lastlog file. This option does not affect
           display of bad login attempts.

       <b>never</b>
           If the /var/log/lastlog file does not contain any old entries
           for the user, indicate that the user has never previously
           logged in with a welcome message.

       <b>nodate</b>
           Don't display the date of the last login.

       <b>noterm</b>
           Don't display the terminal name on which the last login was
           attempted.

       <b>nohost</b>
           Don't indicate from which host the last login was attempted.

       <b>nowtmp</b>
           Don't update the wtmp entry.

       <b>noupdate</b>
           Don't update any file.

       <b>showfailed</b>
           Display number of failed login attempts and the date of the
           last failed attempt from btmp. The date is not displayed when
           <b>nodate </b>is specified.

       <b>inactive=&lt;days&gt;</b>
           This option is specific for the auth or account phase. It
           specifies the number of days after the last login of the user
           when the user will be locked out by the module. The default
           value is 90.

       <b>unlimited</b>
           If the <i>fsize</i> limit is set, this option can be used to
           override it, preventing failures on systems with large UID
           values that lead lastlog to become a huge sparse file.
</pre> <h2>
MODULE TYPES PROVIDED </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>auth </b>and <b>account </b>module type allows one to lock out users who
       did not login recently enough. The <b>session </b>module type is
       provided for displaying the information about the last login
       and/or updating the lastlog and wtmp files.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_SUCCESS
           Everything was successful.

       PAM_SERVICE_ERR
           Internal service module error.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           User not known.

       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           User locked out in the auth or account phase due to
           inactivity.

       PAM_IGNORE
           There was an error during reading the lastlog file in the
           auth or account phase and thus inactivity of the user cannot
           be determined.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to display the last
       login time of a user:

               session  required  pam_lastlog.so nowtmp

       To reject the user if he did not login during the previous 50
       days the following line can be used:

               auth  required  pam_lastlog.so inactive=50
</pre> <h2>
