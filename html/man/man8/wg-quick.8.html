NAME </h2>
<pre>
       wg-quick - set up a WireGuard interface simply
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>wg-quick </b>[ <i>up</i> | <i>down</i> | <i>save</i> | <i>strip</i> ] [ <i>CONFIG_FILE</i> | <i>INTERFACE</i> ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is an extremely simple script for easily bringing up a
       WireGuard interface, suitable for a few common use cases.

       Use <i>up</i> to add and set up an interface, and use <i>down</i> to tear down
       and remove an interface. Running <i>up</i> adds a WireGuard interface,
       brings up the interface with the supplied IP addresses, sets up
       mtu and routes, and optionally runs pre/post up scripts. Running
       <i>down</i> optionally saves the current configuration, removes the
       WireGuard interface, and optionally runs pre/post down scripts.
       Running <i>save</i> saves the configuration of an existing interface
       without bringing the interface down. Use <i>strip</i> to output a
       configuration file with all <a href="wg-quick.8.html">wg-quick(8)</a>-specific options removed,
       suitable for use with <a href="wg.8.html">wg(8)</a>.

       <i>CONFIG_FILE</i> is a configuration file, whose filename is the
       interface name followed by `.conf'. Otherwise, <i>INTERFACE</i> is an
       interface name, with configuration found at
       `/etc/wireguard/<i>INTERFACE</i>.conf', searched first, followed by
       distro-specific search paths.

       Generally speaking, this utility is just a simple script that
       wraps invocations to <a href="wg.8.html">wg(8)</a> and <a href="ip.8.html">ip(8)</a> in order to set up a
       WireGuard interface. It is designed for users with simple needs,
       and users with more advanced needs are highly encouraged to use a
       more specific tool, a more complete network manager, or otherwise
       just use <a href="wg.8.html">wg(8)</a> and <a href="ip.8.html">ip(8)</a>, as usual.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The configuration file adds a few extra configuration values to
       the format understood by <a href="wg.8.html">wg(8)</a> in order to configure additional
       attributes of an interface. It handles the values that it
       understands, and then it passes the remaining ones directly to
       <a href="wg.8.html">wg(8)</a> for further processing.

       It infers all routes from the list of peers' allowed IPs, and
       automatically adds them to the system routing table. If one of
       those routes is the default route (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0), then it
       uses <a href="ip-rule.8.html">ip-rule(8)</a> to handle overriding of the default gateway.

       The configuration file will be passed directly to <a href="wg.8.html">wg(8)</a>'s
       `setconf' sub-command, with the exception of the following
       additions to the <i>Interface</i> section, which are handled by this
       tool:

       •      Address — a comma-separated list of IP (v4 or v6)
              addresses (optionally with CIDR masks) to be assigned to
              the interface. May be specified multiple times.

       •      DNS — a comma-separated list of IP (v4 or v6) addresses to
              be set as the interface's DNS servers, or non-IP hostnames
              to be set as the interface's DNS search domains. May be
              specified multiple times. Upon bringing the interface up,
              this runs `resolvconf -a tun.<i>INTERFACE</i> -m 0 -x` and upon
              bringing it down, this runs `resolvconf -d tun.<i>INTERFACE</i>`.
              If these particular invocations of <b>resolvconf</b>(8) are
              undesirable, the PostUp and PostDown keys below may be
              used instead.

       •      MTU — if not specified, the MTU is automatically
              determined from the endpoint addresses or the system
              default route, which is usually a sane choice. However, to
              manually specify an MTU to override this automatic
              discovery, this value may be specified explicitly.

       •      Table — Controls the routing table to which routes are
              added. There are two special values: `off' disables the
              creation of routes altogether, and `auto' (the default)
              adds routes to the default table and enables special
              handling of default routes.

       •      PreUp, PostUp, PreDown, PostDown — script snippets which
              will be executed by <a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash(1)</a> before/after setting
              up/tearing down the interface, most commonly used to
              configure custom DNS options or firewall rules. The
              special string `%i' is expanded to <i>INTERFACE</i>. Each one may
              be specified multiple times, in which case the commands
              are executed in order.

       •      SaveConfig — if set to `true', the configuration is saved
              from the current state of the interface upon shutdown. Any
              changes made to the configuration file before the
              interface is removed will therefore be overwritten.

       Recommended <i>INTERFACE</i> names include `wg0' or `wgvpn0' or even
       `wgmgmtlan0'.  However, the number at the end is in fact
       optional, and really any free-form string [a-zA-Z0-9_=+.-]{1,15}
       will work. So even interface names corresponding to geographic
       locations would suffice, such as `cincinnati', `nyc', or `paris',
       if that's somehow desirable.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       These examples draw on the same syntax found for <a href="wg.8.html">wg(8)</a>, and a
       more complete description may be found there. Bold lines below
       are for options that extend <a href="wg.8.html">wg(8)</a>.

       The following might be used for connecting as a client to a VPN
       gateway for tunneling all traffic:

           [Interface]
           <b>Address = 10.200.100.8/24</b>
           <b>DNS = 10.200.100.1</b>
           PrivateKey = oK56DE9Ue9zK76rAc8pBl6opph+1v36lm7cXXsQKrQM=

           [Peer]
           PublicKey = GtL7fZc/bLnqZldpVofMCD6hDjrK28SsdLxevJ+qtKU=
           PresharedKey = /UwcSPg38hW/D9Y3tcS1FOV0K1wuURMbS0sesJEP5ak=
           AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
           Endpoint = demo.wireguard.com:51820

       The `Address` field is added here in order to set up the address
       for the interface. The `DNS` field indicates that a DNS server
       for the interface should be configured via <b>resolvconf</b>(8).  The
       peer's allowed IPs entry implies that this interface should be
       configured as the default gateway, which this script does.

       Building on the last example, one might attempt the so-called
       ``kill-switch'', in order to prevent the flow of unencrypted
       packets through the non-WireGuard interfaces, by adding the
       following two lines `PostUp` and `PreDown` lines to the
       `[Interface]` section:

           <b>PostUp = iptables -I OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg</b>
       <b>show %i fwmark) -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL -j REJECT</b>
           <b>PreDown = iptables -D OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg</b>
       <b>show %i fwmark) -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL -j REJECT</b>

       The `PostUp' and `PreDown' fields have been added to specify an
       <a href="iptables.8.html">iptables(8)</a> command which, when used with interfaces that have a
       peer that specifies 0.0.0.0/0 as part of the `AllowedIPs', works
       together with wg-quick's fwmark usage in order to drop all
       packets that are either not coming out of the tunnel encrypted or
       not going through the tunnel itself. (Note that this continues to
       allow most DHCP traffic through, since most DHCP clients make use
       of PF_PACKET sockets, which bypass Netfilter.) When IPv6 is in
       use, additional similar lines could be added using <a href="ip6tables.8.html">ip6tables(8)</a>.

       Or, perhaps it is desirable to store private keys in encrypted
       form, such as through use of <b>pass</b>(1):

           <b>PreUp = wg set %i private-key &lt;(pass WireGuard/private-</b>
       <b>keys/%i)</b>

       For use on a server, the following is a more complicated example
       involving multiple peers:

           [Interface]
           <b>Address = 10.192.122.1/24</b>
           <b>Address = 10.10.0.1/16</b>
           <b>SaveConfig = true</b>
           PrivateKey = yAnz5TF+lXXJte14tji3zlMNq+hd2rYUIgJBgB3fBmk=
           ListenPort = 51820

           [Peer]
           PublicKey = xTIBA5rboUvnH4htodjb6e697QjLERt1NAB4mZqp8Dg=
           AllowedIPs = 10.192.122.3/32, 10.192.124.1/24

           [Peer]
           PublicKey = TrMvSoP4jYQlY6RIzBgbssQqY3vxI2Pi+y71lOWWXX0=
           AllowedIPs = 10.192.122.4/32, 192.168.0.0/16

           [Peer]
           PublicKey = gN65BkIKy1eCE9pP1wdc8ROUtkHLF2PfAqYdyYBz6EA=
           AllowedIPs = 10.10.10.230/32

       Notice the two `Address' lines at the top, and that `SaveConfig'
       is set to `true', indicating that the configuration file should
       be saved on shutdown using the current status of the interface.

       A combination of the `Table', `PostUp', and `PreDown' fields may
       be used for policy routing as well. For example, the following
       may be used to send SSH traffic (TCP port 22) traffic through the
       tunnel:

           [Interface]
           Address = 10.192.122.1/24
           PrivateKey = yAnz5TF+lXXJte14tji3zlMNq+hd2rYUIgJBgB3fBmk=
           ListenPort = 51820
           <b>Table = 1234</b>
           <b>PostUp = ip rule add ipproto tcp dport 22 table 1234</b>
           <b>PreDown = ip rule delete ipproto tcp dport 22 table 1234</b>

           [Peer]
           PublicKey = xTIBA5rboUvnH4htodjb6e697QjLERt1NAB4mZqp8Dg=
           AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0

       These configuration files may be placed in any directory, putting
       the desired interface name in the filename:

           <b># wg-quick up /path/to/wgnet0.conf</b>

       For convenience, if only an interface name is supplied, it
       automatically chooses a path in `/etc/wireguard/':

           <b># wg-quick up wgnet0</b>

       This will load the configuration file
       `/etc/wireguard/wgnet0.conf'.

       The <i>strip</i> command is useful for reloading configuration files
       without disrupting active sessions:

           <b># wg syncconf wgnet0 &lt;(wg-quick strip wgnet0)</b>
