</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tc </b>... <b>action tunnel_key </b>{ <b>unset </b>| <i>SET</i> }

       <i>SET</i> := <b>set src_ip </b><i>ADDRESS</i> <b>dst_ip </b><i>ADDRESS</i> <b>id </b><i>KEY_ID</i> <b>dst_port</b>
               <i>UDP_PORT</i> <b>tos </b><i>TOS</i> <b>ttl </b><i>TTL</i> [ <b>csum </b>| <b>nocsum </b>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>tunnel_key </b>action combined with a shared IP tunnel device,
       allows one to perform IP tunnel en- or decapsulation on a packet,
       reflected by the operation modes <i>UNSET</i> and <i>SET</i>.  The <i>UNSET</i> mode
       is optional - even without using it, the metadata information
       will be released automatically when packet processing will be
       finished.  <i>UNSET</i> function could be used in cases when traffic is
       forwarded between two tunnels, where the metadata from the first
       tunnel will be used for encapsulation done by the second tunnel.
       <i>SET</i> mode requires the source and destination ip <i>ADDRESS</i> and the
       tunnel key id <i>KEY_ID</i> which will be used by the ip tunnel shared
       device to create the tunnel header. The <b>tunnel_key </b>action is
       useful only in combination with a <b>mirred redirect </b>action to a
       shared IP tunnel device which will use the metadata (for <i>SET</i> )
       and unset the metadata created by it (for <i>UNSET</i> ).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>unset  </b>Unset the tunnel metadata created by the IP tunnel device.
              This function is not mandatory and might be used only in
              some specific use cases (as explained above).

       <b>set    </b>Set tunnel metadata to be used by the IP tunnel device.
              Requires <b>src_ip </b>and <b>dst_ip </b>options.  <b>id </b>, <b>dst_port </b>,
              <b>geneve_opts </b>, <b>vxlan_opts </b>and <b>erspan_opts </b>are optional.

              <b>id     </b>Tunnel ID (for example VNI in VXLAN tunnel)

              <b>src_ip </b>Outer header source IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)

              <b>dst_ip </b>Outer header destination IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)

              <b>dst_port</b>
                     Outer header destination UDP port

              <b>geneve_opts</b>
                     Geneve variable length options.  <b>geneve_opts </b>is
                     specified in the form CLASS:TYPE:DATA, where CLASS
                     is represented as a 16bit hexadecimal value, TYPE
                     as an 8bit hexadecimal value and DATA as a variable
                     length hexadecimal value. Additionally multiple
                     options may be listed using a comma delimiter.

              <b>vxlan_opts</b>
                     Vxlan metadata options.  <b>vxlan_opts </b>is specified in
                     the form GBP, as a 32bit number. Multiple options
                     is not supported.

              <b>erspan_opts</b>
                     Erspan metadata options.  <b>erspan_opts </b>is specified
                     in the form VERSION:INDEX:DIR:HWID, where VERSION
                     is represented as a 8bit number, INDEX as an 32bit
                     number, DIR and HWID as a 8bit number.  Multiple
                     options is not supported. Note INDEX is used when
                     VERSION is 1, and DIR and HWID are used when
                     VERSION is 2.

              <b>tos    </b>Outer header TOS

              <b>ttl    </b>Outer header TTL

              [<b>no</b>]<b>csum</b>
                     Controls outer UDP checksum. When set to <b>csum</b>
                     (which is default), the outer UDP checksum is
                     calculated and included in the packets. When set to
                     <b>nocsum</b>, outer UDP checksum is zero. Note that when
                     using zero UDP checksums with IPv6, the other
                     tunnel endpoint must be configured to accept such
                     packets.  In Linux, this would be the
                     <b>udp6zerocsumrx </b>option for the VXLAN tunnel
                     interface.

                     If using <b>nocsum </b>with IPv6, be sure you know what
                     you are doing. Zero UDP checksums provide weaker
                     protection against corrupted packets. See RFC6935
                     for details.

              <b>nofrag </b>disallow IP fragmentation.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following example encapsulates incoming ICMP packets on eth0
       into a vxlan tunnel, by setting metadata to VNI 11, source IP
       11.11.0.1 and destination IP 11.11.0.2, and by redirecting the
       packet with the metadata to device vxlan0, which will do the
       actual encapsulation using the metadata:

              #tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle ffff: ingress
              #tc filter add dev eth0 protocol ip parent ffff: \
                flower \
                  ip_proto icmp \
                action tunnel_key set \
                  src_ip 11.11.0.1 \
                  dst_ip 11.11.0.2 \
                  id 11 \
                action mirred egress redirect dev vxlan0

       Here is an example of the <b>unset </b>function: Incoming VXLAN traffic
       with outer IP's and VNI 11 is decapsulated by vxlan0 and metadata
       is unset before redirecting to tunl1 device:

              #tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle ffff: ingress
              #tc filter add dev vxlan0 protocol ip parent ffff:   flower \
                     enc_src_ip 11.11.0.2 enc_dst_ip 11.11.0.1 enc_key_id 11   action tunnel_key unset  action mirred egress redirect dev tunl1
