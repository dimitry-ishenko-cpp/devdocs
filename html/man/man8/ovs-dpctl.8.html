       <b>ovs-dpctl </b>[<i>options</i>] <i>command</i> [<i>switch</i>] [<i>args</i>...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>ovs-dpctl </b>program can create, modify, and delete Open vSwitch
       datapaths.  A single machine may host any number of datapaths.

       This program works only with datapaths that are implemented
       outside of <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>itself, such as the Linux and Windows
       kernel-based datapaths.  To manage datapaths that are integrated
       into <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, such as the userspace (<b>netdev</b>) datapath, use
       <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> to invoke the <b>dpctl/* </b>commands, which are
       documented in <a href="ovs-vswitchd.8.html">ovs-vswitchd(8)</a>.

       A newly created datapath is associated with only one network
       device, a virtual network device sometimes called the datapath's
       ``local port''.  A newly created datapath is not, however,
       associated with any of the host's other network devices.  To
       intercept and process traffic on a given network device, use the
       <b>add-if </b>command to explicitly add that network device to the
       datapath.

       If <a href="ovs-vswitchd.8.html">ovs-vswitchd(8)</a> is in use, use <a href="ovs-vsctl.8.html">ovs-vsctl(8)</a> instead of
       <b>ovs-dpctl</b>.

       Most <b>ovs-dpctl </b>commands that work with datapaths take an argument
       that specifies the name of the datapath.  Datapath names take the
       form [<i>type</i><b>@</b>]<i>name</i>, where <i>name</i> is the network device associated
       with the datapath's local port.  If <i>type</i> is given, it specifies
       the datapath provider of <i>name</i>, otherwise the default provider
       <b>system </b>is assumed.

       The following commands manage datapaths.  Do not use commands to
       add or remove or modify datapaths if <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is running
       because this interferes with <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own datapath
       management.

       <b>add-dp </b><i>dp</i> [<i>netdev</i>[<b>,</b><i>option</i>]...]
              Creates datapath <i>dp</i>, with a local port also named <i>dp</i>.
              This will fail if a network device <i>dp</i> already exists.

              If <i>netdev</i>s are specified, <b>ovs-dpctl </b>adds them to the new
              datapath, just as if <b>add-if </b>was specified.

       <b>del-dp </b><i>dp</i>
              Deletes datapath <i>dp</i>.  If <i>dp</i> is associated with any network
              devices, they are automatically removed.

       <b>add-if </b><i>dp netdev</i>[<b>,</b><i>option</i>]...
              Adds each <i>netdev</i> to the set of network devices datapath <i>dp</i>
              monitors, where <i>dp</i> is the name of an existing datapath,
              and <i>netdev</i> is the name of one of the host's network
              devices, e.g. <b>eth0</b>.  Once a network device has been added
              to a datapath, the datapath has complete ownership of the
              network device's traffic and the network device appears
              silent to the rest of the system.

              A <i>netdev</i> may be followed by a comma-separated list of
              options.  The following options are currently supported:

              <b>type=</b><i>type</i>
                     Specifies the type of port to add.  The default
                     type is <b>system</b>.

              <b>port_no=</b><i>port</i>
                     Requests a specific port number within the
                     datapath.  If this option is not specified then one
                     will be automatically assigned.

              <i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
                     Adds an arbitrary key-value option to the port's
                     configuration.

              <a href="../man5/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</a> documents the available port types
              and options.

       <b>set-if </b><i>dp port</i>[<b>,</b><i>option</i>]...
              Reconfigures each <i>port</i> in <i>dp</i> as specified.  An <i>option</i> of
              the form <i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> adds the specified key-value option to
              the port or overrides an existing key's value.  An <i>option</i>
              of the form <i>key</i><b>=</b>, that is, without a value, deletes the
              key-value named <i>key</i>.  The type and port number of a port
              cannot be changed, so <b>type </b>and <b>port_no </b>are only allowed if
              they match the existing configuration.

       <b>del-if </b><i>dp netdev</i>...
              Removes each <i>netdev</i> from the list of network devices
              datapath <i>dp</i> monitors.

       <b>dump-dps</b>
              Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate
              line.

       [<b>-s </b>| <b>--statistics</b>] <b>show </b>[<i>dp</i>...]
              Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including their
              datapath numbers and a list of ports connected to each
              datapath.  (The local port is identified as port 0.)  If
              <b>-s </b>or <b>--statistics </b>is specified, then packet and byte
              counters are also printed for each port.

              The datapath numbers consists of flow stats and mega flow
              mask stats.

              The "lookups" row displays three stats related to flow
              lookup triggered by processing incoming packets in the
              datapath. "hit" displays number of packets matches
              existing flows. "missed" displays the number of packets
              not matching any existing flow and require user space
              processing.  "lost" displays number of packets destined
              for user space process but subsequently dropped before
              reaching userspace. The sum of "hit" and "miss" equals to
              the total number of packets datapath processed.

              The "flows" row displays the number of flows in datapath.

              The "masks" row displays the mega flow mask stats. This
              row is omitted for datapath not implementing mega flow.
              "hit" displays the total number of masks visited for
              matching incoming packets. "total" displays number of
              masks in the datapath. "hit/pkt" displays the average
              number of masks visited per packet; the ratio between
              "hit" and total number of packets processed by the
              datapath.

              If one or more datapaths are specified, information on
              only those datapaths are displayed.  Otherwise, <b>ovs-dpctl</b>
              displays information about all configured datapaths.

   <b>DATAPATH FLOW TABLE DEBUGGING COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are primarily useful for debugging Open
       vSwitch.  The flow table entries (both matches and actions) that
       they work with are not OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are
       different and considerably simpler flows maintained by the Open
       vSwitch kernel module.  Do not use commands to add or remove or
       modify datapath flows if <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is running because it
       interferes with <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own datapath flow management.  Use
       <a href="ovs-ofctl.8.html">ovs-ofctl(8)</a>, instead, to work with OpenFlow flow entries.

       The <i>dp</i> argument to each of these commands is optional when
       exactly one datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the
       default.  When multiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is
       required.

       [<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>] [<b>--names </b>| <b>--no-names</b>] <b>dump-flows </b>[<i>dp</i>]
       [<b>filter=</b><i>filter</i>] [<b>type=</b><i>type</i>] [<b>pmd=</b><i>pmd</i>]
              Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath <i>dp</i>'s
              flow table.  Without <b>-m </b>or <b>--more</b>, output omits match
              fields that a flow wildcards entirely; with <b>-m </b>or <b>--more</b>,
              output includes all wildcarded fields.

              If <b>filter=</b><i>filter</i> is specified, only displays the flows
              that match the <i>filter</i>. <i>filter</i> is a flow in the form
              similar to that accepted by <a href="ovs-ofctl.8.html">ovs-ofctl(8)</a>'s <b>add-flow</b>
              command. (This is not an OpenFlow flow: besides other
              differences, it never contains wildcards.)  The <i>filter</i> is
              also useful to match wildcarded fields in the datapath
              flow. As an example, <b>filter='tcp,tp_src=100' </b>will match
              the datapath flow containing
              '<b>tcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)</b>'.

              If <b>pmd=</b><i>pmd</i> is specified, only displays flows of the
              specified pmd.  Using <b>pmd=</b><i>-1</i> will restrict the dump to
              flows from the main thread.  This option is only supported
              by the <b>userspace datapath</b>.

              If <b>type=</b><i>type</i> is specified, only displays flows of the
              specified types.  This option supported only for
              <b>ovs-appctl dpctl/dump-flows</b>.  <i>type</i> is a comma separated
              list, which can contain any of the following:
                 <b>ovs </b>- displays flows handled in the ovs dp
                 <b>tc </b>- displays flows handled in the tc dp
                 <b>dpdk </b>- displays flows fully offloaded by dpdk
                 <b>offloaded </b>- displays flows offloaded to the HW
                 <b>non-offloaded </b>- displays flows not offloaded to the HW
                 <b>partially-offloaded </b>- displays flows where only part of
              their proccessing is done in HW
                 <b>all </b>- displays all the types of flows

              By default all the types of flows are displayed.
              <b>ovs-dpctl </b>always acts as if the <b>type </b>was <i>ovs</i>.

       <b>add-flow </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>flow actions</i>

       [<b>--clear</b>] [<b>--may-create</b>] [<b>-s </b>| <b>--statistics</b>] <b>mod-flow </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>flow</i>
       <i>actions</i>
              Adds or modifies a flow in <i>dp</i>'s flow table that, when a
              packet matching <i>flow</i> arrives, causes <i>actions</i> to be
              executed.

              The <b>add-flow </b>command succeeds only if <i>flow</i> does not
              already exist in <i>dp</i>.  Contrariwise, <b>mod-flow </b>without
              <b>--may-create </b>only modifies the actions for an existing
              flow.  With <b>--may-create</b>, <b>mod-flow </b>will add a new flow or
              modify an existing one.

              If <b>-s </b>or <b>--statistics </b>is specified, then <b>mod-flow </b>prints
              the modified flow's statistics.  A flow's statistics are
              the number of packets and bytes that have passed through
              the flow, the elapsed time since the flow last processed a
              packet (if ever), and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP
              flags processed through the flow.

              With <b>--clear</b>, <b>mod-flow </b>zeros out the flow's statistics.
              The statistics printed if <b>-s </b>or <b>--statistics </b>is also
              specified are those from just before clearing the
              statistics.

              NOTE: <i>flow</i> and <i>actions</i> do not match the syntax used with
              <a href="ovs-ofctl.8.html">ovs-ofctl(8)</a>'s <b>add-flow </b>command.

              <b>Usage Examples</b>

              Forward ARP between ports 1 and 2 on datapath myDP:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 2

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 1

              Forward all IPv4 traffic between two addresses on ports 1
              and 2:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.4,dst=172.31.110.5)" 2

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.5,dst=172.31.110.4)" 1

       <b>add-flows </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>file</i>
       <b>mod-flows </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>file</i>
       <b>del-flows </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>file</i>
              Reads flow entries from <i>file</i> (or <b>stdin </b>if <i>file</i> is <b>-</b>) and
              adds, modifies, or deletes each entry to the datapath.
              Each flow specification (e.g., each line in <i>file</i>) may
              start with <b>add</b>, <b>modify</b>, or <b>delete </b>keyword to specify
              whether a flow is to be added, modified, or deleted. A
              flow specification without one of these keywords is
              treated based on the used command.  All flow modifications
              are executed as individual transactions in the order
              specified.

       [<b>-s </b>| <b>--statistics</b>] <b>del-flow </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>flow</i>
              Deletes the flow from <i>dp</i>'s flow table that matches <i>flow</i>.
              If <b>-s </b>or <b>--statistics </b>is specified, then <b>del-flow </b>prints
              the deleted flow's statistics.

       [<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>] [<b>--names </b>| <b>--no-names</b>] <b>get-flow </b>[<i>dp</i>] ufid:<i>ufid</i>
              Fetches the flow from <i>dp</i>'s flow table with unique
              identifier <i>ufid</i>.  <i>ufid</i> must be specified as a string of 32
              hexadecimal characters.

       <b>del-flows </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Deletes all flow entries from datapath <i>dp</i>'s flow table.

   <b>DATAPATH FLOW CACHE COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are useful for debugging and configuring
       the datapath flow cache settings.

       <b>cache-get-size </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Prints the current cache sizes to the console.

       <b>cache-set-size </b><i>dp cache size</i>
              Set the <i>dp</i>'s specific <i>cache</i> to the given <i>size</i>.  The cache
              name can be found by using the <b>cache-get-size </b>command.

   <b>CONNECTION TRACKING TABLE COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are useful for debugging and configuring
       the connection tracking table in the datapath.

       The <i>dp</i> argument to each of these commands is optional when
       exactly one datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the
       default.  When multiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is
       required.

       <b>N.B.</b>(Linux specific): the <i>system</i> datapaths (i.e. the Linux kernel
       module Open vSwitch datapaths) share a single connection tracking
       table (which is also used by other kernel subsystems, such as
       iptables, nftables and the regular host stack).  Therefore, the
       following commands do not apply specifically to one datapath.

       <b>ipf-set-enabled </b>[<i>dp</i>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b>
       <b>ipf-set-disabled </b>[<i>dp</i>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b>
              Enables or disables IP fragmentation handling for the
              userspace connection tracker.  Either <b>v4 </b>or <b>v6 </b>must be
              specified.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly are
              enabled by default.  Only supported for the userspace
              datapath.

       <b>ipf-set-min-frag </b>[<i>dp</i>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6 </b><i>minfrag</i>
              Sets the minimum fragment size (L3 header and data) for
              non-final fragments to <i>minfrag</i>.  Either <b>v4 </b>or <b>v6 </b>must be
              specified.  For enhanced DOS security, higher minimum
              fragment sizes can usually be used.  The default IPv4
              value is 1200 and the clamped minimum is 400.  The default
              IPv6 value is 1280, with a clamped minimum of 400, for
              testing flexibility.  The maximum fragment size is not
              clamped, however, setting this value too high might result
              in valid fragments being dropped.  Only supported for
              userspace datapath.

       <b>ipf-set-max-nfrags </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>maxfrags</i>
              Sets the maximum number of fragments tracked by the
              userspace datapath connection tracker to <i>maxfrags</i>.  The
              default value is 1000 and the clamped maximum is 5000.
              Note that packet buffers can be held by the fragmentation
              module while fragments are incomplete, but will timeout
              after 15 seconds.  Memory pool sizing should be set
              accordingly when fragmentation is enabled.  Only supported
              for userspace datapath.

       [<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>] <b>ipf-get-status </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Gets the configuration settings and fragment counters
              associated with the fragmentation handling of the
              userspace datapath connection tracker.  With <b>-m </b>or <b>--more</b>,
              also dumps the IP fragment lists.  Only supported for
              userspace datapath.

       [<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>] [<b>-s </b>| <b>--statistics</b>] <b>dump-conntrack </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>]
              Prints to the console all the connection entries in the
              tracker used by <i>dp</i>.  If <b>zone=</b><i>zone</i> is specified, only shows
              the connections in <i>zone</i>.  With <b>--more</b>, some implementation
              specific details are included. With <b>--statistics </b>timeouts
              and timestamps are added to the output.

       <b>dump-conntrack-exp </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>]
              Prints to the console all the expectation entries in the
              tracker used by <i>dp</i>.  If <b>zone=</b><i>zone</i> is specified, only shows
              the expectations in <i>zone</i>. Only supported for userspace
              datapath.

       <b>flush-conntrack </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>] [<i>ct-origin-tuple</i> [<i>ct-reply-</i>
       <i>tuple</i>]]
              Flushes the connection entries in the tracker used by <i>dp</i>
              based on <i>zone</i> and connection tracking tuple <i>ct-origin-</i>
              <i>tuple</i>.  If <i>ct-tuple</i> is not provided, flushes all the
              connection entries.  If <b>zone</b>=<i>zone</i> is specified, only
              flushes the connections in <i>zone</i>.

              If <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i> is provided, flushes the
              connection entry specified by <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i> in
              <i>zone</i>.  The zone defaults to 0 if it is not provided.  The
              userspace connection tracker requires flushing with the
              original pre-NATed tuple and a warning log will be
              otherwise generated.  The tuple can be partial and will
              remove all connections that are matching on the specified
              fields.  In order to specify only <i>ct-reply-tuple</i>, provide
              empty string as <i>ct-origin-tuple</i>.

              Note: Currently there is a limitation for matching on
              ICMP, in order to partially match on ICMP parameters the
              <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i> has to include either source or
              destination IP.

              An example of an IPv4 ICMP <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i>:

              "ct_nw_src=10.1.1.1,ct_nw_dst=10.1.1.2,ct_nw_proto=1,icmp_type=8,icmp_code=0,icmp_id=10"

              An example of an IPv6 TCP <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i>:

              "ct_ipv6_src=fc00::1,ct_ipv6_dst=fc00::2,ct_nw_proto=6,ct_tp_src=1,ct_tp_dst=2"

       [<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>] <b>ct-stats-show </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>]
              Displays the number of connections grouped by protocol
              used by <i>dp</i>.  If <b>zone=</b><i>zone</i> is specified, numbers refer to
              the connections in <i>zone</i>.  With <b>--more</b>, groups by
              connection state for each protocol.

       <b>ct-bkts </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>gt=</b><i>threshold</i>]
              For each conntrack bucket, displays the number of
              connections used by <i>dp</i>.  If <b>gt=</b><i>threshold</i> is specified,
              bucket numbers are displayed when the number of
              connections in a bucket is greater than <i>threshold</i>.

       <b>ct-set-maxconns </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>maxconns</i>
              Sets the maximum limit of connection tracker entries to
              <i>maxconns</i> on <i>dp</i>.  This can be used to reduce the processing
              load on the system due to connection tracking or simply
              limiting connection tracking.  If the number of
              connections is already over the new maximum limit request
              then the new maximum limit will be enforced when the
              number of connections decreases to that limit, which
              normally happens due to connection expiry.  Only supported
              for userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-get-maxconns </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Prints the maximum limit of connection tracker entries on
              <i>dp</i>.  Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-get-nconns </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Prints the current number of connection tracker entries on
              <i>dp</i>.  Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-enable-tcp-seq-chk </b>[<i>dp</i>]
       <b>ct-disable-tcp-seq-chk </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Enables or disables TCP sequence checking.  When set to
              disabled, all sequence number verification is disabled,
              including for TCP resets.  This is similar, but not the
              same as 'be_liberal' mode, as in Netfilter.  Disabling
              sequence number verification is not an optimization in
              itself, but is needed for some hardware offload support
              which might offer some performance advantage. Sequence
              number checking is enabled by default to enforce better
              security and should only be disabled if required for
              hardware offload support.  This command is only supported
              for the userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-get-tcp-seq-chk </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Prints whether TCP sequence checking is enabled or
              disabled on <i>dp</i>.  Only supported for the userspace
              datapath.

       <b>ct-set-sweep-interval </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>ms</i>
              Sets the sweep interval. Only supported for the userspace
              datapath.

       <b>ct-get-sweep-interval </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Prints the current sweep interval in ms. Only supported
              for the userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-set-limits </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>default=</b><i>default_limit</i>]
       [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>,<b>limit=</b><i>limit</i>]...
              Sets the maximum allowed number of connections in a
              connection tracking zone.  A specific <i>zone</i> may be set to
              <i>limit</i>, and multiple zones may be specified with a comma-
              separated list.  If a per-zone limit for a particular zone
              is not specified in the datapath, it defaults to the
              default per-zone limit.  A default zone may be specified
              with the <b>default=</b><i>default_limit</i> argument.   Initially, the
              default per-zone limit is unlimited.  An unlimited number
              of entries may be set with <b>0 </b>limit.

       <b>ct-del-limits </b>[<i>dp</i>] <b>zone=</b><i>zone[,zone]</i>...
              Deletes the connection tracking limit for <i>zone</i>.  Multiple
              zones may be specified with a comma-separated list.

       <b>ct-get-limits </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>[<b>,</b><i>zone</i>]...]
              Retrieves the maximum allowed number of connections and
              current counts per-zone.  If <i>zone</i> is given, only the
              specified zone(s) are printed.  If no zones are specified,
              all the zone limits and counts are provided.  The command
              always displays the default zone limit.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-t</b>
       <b>--timeout=</b><i>secs</i>
              Limits <b>ovs-dpctl </b>runtime to approximately <i>secs</i> seconds.
              If the timeout expires, <b>ovs-dpctl </b>will exit with a <b>SIGALRM</b>
              signal.

       <b>-v</b>[<i>spec</i>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<i>spec</i>]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any <i>spec</i>, sets the log level
              for every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <i>spec</i>
              is a list of words separated by spaces or commas or
              colons, up to one from each category below:

              •      A valid module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b>
                     command on <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a>, limits the log level
                     change to the specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level
                     change to only to the system log, to the console,
                     or to a file, respectively.  (If <b>--detach </b>is
                     specified, <b>ovs-dpctl </b>closes its standard file
                     descriptors, so logging to the console will have no
                     effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog </b>is accepted as a word
                     and is only useful along with the <b>--syslog-target</b>
                     option (the word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the
                     log level.  Messages of the given severity or
                     higher will be logged, and messages of lower
                     severity will be filtered out.  <b>off </b>filters out all
                     messages.  See <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a definition of
                     each log level.

              Case is not significant within <i>spec</i>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a
              file will not take place unless <b>--log-file </b>is also
              specified (see below).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any </b>is
              accepted as a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
              <b>--verbose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
              Sets the log pattern for <i>destination</i> to <i>pattern</i>.  Refer to
              <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a description of the valid syntax for
              <i>pattern</i>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><i>facility</i>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><i>facility</i>
              Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. <i>facility</i> can
              be one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>,
              <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>, <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>,
              <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>, <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6 </b>or <b>local7</b>.
              If this option is not specified, <b>daemon </b>is used as the
              default for the local system syslog and <b>local0 </b>is used
              while sending a message to the target provided via the
              <b>--syslog-target </b>option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
              Enables logging to a file.  If <i>file</i> is specified, then it
              is used as the exact name for the log file.  The default
              log file name used if <i>file</i> is omitted is
              <b>/usr/local/var/log/openvswitch/ovs-dpctl.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><i>host</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <i>port</i> on <i>host</i>, in addition to
              the system syslog.  The <i>host</i> must be a numerical IP
              address, not a hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><i>method</i>
              Specify <i>method</i> how syslog messages should be sent to
              syslog daemon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog() </b>function.  Downside of
                     using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix
                     to every message before it is actually sent to the
                     syslog daemon over <b>/dev/log </b>UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><i>file</i>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is
                     possible to specify arbitrary message format with
                     this option.  However, <b>rsyslogd 8.9 </b>and older
                     versions use hard coded parser function anyway that
                     limits UNIX domain socket use.  If you want to use
                     arbitrary message format with older <b>rsyslogd</b>
                     versions, then use UDP socket to localhost IP
                     address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><i>ip</i>:<i>port</i>, use UDP socket.  With this method it
                     is possible to use arbitrary message format also
                     with older <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages
                     over UDP socket extra precaution needs to be taken
                     into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to
                     be configured to listen on the specified UDP port,
                     accidental iptables rules could be interfering with
                     local syslog traffic and there are some security
                     considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do
                     not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is taken from the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>
              environment variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help </b>Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.
