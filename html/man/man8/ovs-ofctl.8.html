DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>ovs-ofctl </b>program is a command line tool for monitoring and
       administering OpenFlow switches.  It can also show the current
       state of an OpenFlow switch, including features, configuration,
       and table entries.  It should work with any OpenFlow switch, not
       just Open vSwitch.

   <b>OpenFlow Switch Management Commands</b>
       These commands allow <b>ovs-ofctl </b>to monitor and administer an
       OpenFlow switch.  It is able to show the current state of a
       switch, including features, configuration, and table entries.

       Most of these commands take an argument that specifies the method
       for connecting to an OpenFlow switch.  The following connection
       methods are supported:

              <b>ssl:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
              <b>tcp:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified <i>port</i> on the given <i>host</i>, which can be
                     expressed either as a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address in IPv4 or IPv6
                     address format.  Wrap IPv6 addresses in square
                     brackets, e.g. <b>tcp:[::1]:6653</b>.  On Linux, use
                     <b>%</b><i>device</i> to designate a scope for IPv6 link-level
                     addresses, e.g. <b>tcp:[fe80::1234%eth0]:6653</b>.  For
                     <b>ssl</b>, the <b>--private-key</b>, <b>--certificate</b>, and
                     <b>--ca-cert </b>options are mandatory.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

              <b>unix:</b><i>file</i>
                     On POSIX, a Unix domain server socket named <i>file</i>.

                     On Windows, connect to a local named pipe that is
                     represented by a file created in the path <i>file</i> to
                     mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.

              <i>file</i>   This is short for <b>unix:</b><i>file</i>, as long as <i>file</i> does
                     not contain a colon.

              <i>bridge</i> This is short for
                     <b>unix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/</b><i>bridge</i><b>.mgmt</b>, as
                     long as <i>bridge</i> does not contain a colon.

              [<i>type</i><b>@</b>]<i>dp</i>
                     Attempts to look up the bridge associated with <i>dp</i>
                     and open as above.  If <i>type</i> is given, it specifies
                     the datapath provider of <i>dp</i>, otherwise the default
                     provider <b>system </b>is assumed.

       <b>show </b><i>switch</i>
              Prints to the console information on <i>switch</i>, including
              information on its flow tables and ports.

       <b>dump-tables </b><i>switch</i>
              Prints to the console statistics for each of the flow
              tables used by <i>switch</i>.

       <b>dump-table-features </b><i>switch</i>
              Prints to the console features for each of the flow tables
              used by <i>switch</i>.

       <b>dump-table-desc </b><i>switch</i>
              Prints to the console configuration for each of the flow
              tables used by <i>switch</i> for OpenFlow 1.4+.

       <b>mod-table </b><i>switch table setting</i>
              This command configures flow table settings in <i>switch</i> for
              OpenFlow table <i>table</i>, which may be expressed as a number
              or (unless <b>--no-names </b>is specified) a name.

              The available settings depend on the OpenFlow version in
              use.  In OpenFlow 1.1 and 1.2 (which must be enabled with
              the <b>-O </b>option) only, <b>mod-table </b>configures behavior when no
              flow is found when a packet is looked up in a flow table.
              The following <i>setting</i> values are available:

              <b>drop   </b>Drop the packet.

              <b>continue</b>
                     Continue to the next table in the pipeline.  (This
                     is how an OpenFlow 1.0 switch always handles
                     packets that do not match any flow, in tables other
                     than the last one.)

              <b>controller</b>
                     Send to controller.  (This is how an OpenFlow 1.0
                     switch always handles packets that do not match any
                     flow in the last table.)

              In OpenFlow 1.3 and later (which must be enabled with the
              <b>-O </b>option) and Open vSwitch 2.11 and later only, <b>mod-table</b>
              can change the name of a table:

              <b>name:</b><i>new-name</i>
                     Changes the name of the table to <i>new-name</i>.  Use an
                     empty <i>new-name</i> to clear the name.  (This will be
                     ineffective if the name is set via the <b>name </b>column
                     in the <b>Flow_Table </b>table in the <b>Open_vSwitch</b>
                     database as described in <a href="../man5/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</a>.)

              In OpenFlow 1.4 and later (which must be enabled with the
              <b>-O </b>option) only, <b>mod-table </b>configures the behavior when a
              controller attempts to add a flow to a flow table that is
              full.  The following <i>setting</i> values are available:

              <b>evict  </b>Delete some existing flow from the flow table,
                     according to the algorithm described for the
                     <b>Flow_Table </b>table in <a href="../man5/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</a>.

              <b>noevict</b>
                     Refuse to add the new flow.  (Eviction might still
                     be enabled through the <b>overflow_policy </b>column in
                     the <b>Flow_Table </b>table documented in
                     <a href="../man5/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</a>.)

              <b>vacancy:</b><i>low</i><b>,</b><i>high</i>
                     Enables sending vacancy events to controllers using
                     <b>TABLE_STATUS </b>messages, based on percentage
                     thresholds <i>low</i> and <i>high</i>.

              <b>novacancy</b>
                     Disables vacancy events.

       <b>dump-ports </b><i>switch</i> [<i>netdev</i>]
              Prints to the console statistics for network devices
              associated with <i>switch</i>.  If <i>netdev</i> is specified, only the
              statistics associated with that device will be printed.
              <i>netdev</i> can be an OpenFlow assigned port number or device
              name, e.g. <b>eth0</b>.

       <b>dump-ports-desc </b><i>switch</i> [<i>port</i>]
              Prints to the console detailed information about network
              devices associated with <i>switch</i>.  To dump only a specific
              port, specify its number as <i>port</i>.  Otherwise, if <i>port</i> is
              omitted, or if it is specified as <b>ANY</b>, then all ports are
              printed.  This is a subset of the information provided by
              the <b>show </b>command.

              If the connection to <i>switch</i> negotiates OpenFlow 1.0, 1.2,
              or 1.2, this command uses an OpenFlow extension only
              implemented in Open vSwitch (version 1.7 and later).

              Only OpenFlow 1.5 and later support dumping a specific
              port.  Earlier versions of OpenFlow always dump all ports.

       <b>mod-port </b><i>switch port action</i>
              Modify characteristics of port <b>port </b>in <i>switch</i>.  <i>port</i> may
              be an OpenFlow port number or name (unless <b>--no-names </b>is
              specified) or the keyword <b>LOCAL </b>(the preferred way to
              refer to the OpenFlow local port).  The <i>action</i> may be any
              one of the following:
              <b>up</b>
              <b>down   </b>Enable or disable the interface.  This is
                     equivalent to <b>ip link set up </b>or <b>ip link set down </b>on
                     a Unix system.

              <b>stp</b>
              <b>no-stp </b>Enable or disable 802.1D spanning tree protocol
                     (STP) on the interface.  OpenFlow implementations
                     that don't support STP will refuse to enable it.

              <b>receive</b>
              <b>no-receive</b>
              <b>receive-stp</b>
              <b>no-receive-stp</b>
                     Enable or disable OpenFlow processing of packets
                     received on this interface.  When packet processing
                     is disabled, packets will be dropped instead of
                     being processed through the OpenFlow table.  The
                     <b>receive </b>or <b>no-receive </b>setting applies to all
                     packets except 802.1D spanning tree packets, which
                     are separately controlled by <b>receive-stp </b>or
                     <b>no-receive-stp</b>.

              <b>forward</b>
              <b>no-forward</b>
                     Allow or disallow forwarding of traffic to this
                     interface.  By default, forwarding is enabled.

              <b>flood</b>
              <b>no-flood</b>
                     Controls whether an OpenFlow <b>flood </b>action will send
                     traffic out this interface.  By default, flooding
                     is enabled.  Disabling flooding is primarily useful
                     to prevent loops when a spanning tree protocol is
                     not in use.

              <b>packet-in</b>
              <b>no-packet-in</b>
                     Controls whether packets received on this interface
                     that do not match a flow table entry generate a
                     ``packet in'' message to the OpenFlow controller.
                     By default, ``packet in'' messages are enabled.

              The <b>show </b>command displays (among other information) the
              configuration that <b>mod-port </b>changes.

       <b>get-frags </b><i>switch</i>
              Prints <i>switch</i>'s fragment handling mode.  See <b>set-frags</b>,
              below, for a description of each fragment handling mode.

              The <b>show </b>command also prints the fragment handling mode
              among its other output.

       <b>set-frags </b><i>switch frag_mode</i>
              Configures <i>switch</i>'s treatment of IPv4 and IPv6 fragments.
              The choices for <i>frag_mode</i> are:

              <b>normal </b>Fragments pass through the flow table like non-
                     fragmented packets.  The TCP ports, UDP ports, and
                     ICMP type and code fields are always set to 0, even
                     for fragments where that information would
                     otherwise be available (fragments with offset 0).
                     This is the default fragment handling mode for an
                     OpenFlow switch.

              <b>drop   </b>Fragments are dropped without passing through the
                     flow table.

              <b>reassemble</b>
                     The switch reassembles fragments into full IP
                     packets before passing them through the flow table.
                     Open vSwitch does not implement this fragment
                     handling mode.

              <b>nx-match</b>
                     Fragments pass through the flow table like non-
                     fragmented packets.  The TCP ports, UDP ports, and
                     ICMP type and code fields are available for
                     matching for fragments with offset 0, and set to 0
                     in fragments with nonzero offset.  This mode is a
                     Nicira extension.

              See the description of <b>ip_frag</b>, in <a href="../man7/ovs-fields.7.html">ovs-fields(7)</a>, for a
              way to match on whether a packet is a fragment and on its
              fragment offset.

       <b>dump-flows </b><i>switch</i> [<i>flows</i>]
              Prints to the console all flow entries in <i>switch</i>'s tables
              that match <i>flows</i>.  If <i>flows</i> is omitted, all flows in the
              switch are retrieved.  See <b>Flow Syntax</b>, below, for the
              syntax of <i>flows</i>.  The output format is described in <b>Table</b>
              <b>Entry Output</b>.

              By default, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>prints flow entries in the same
              order that the switch sends them, which is unlikely to be
              intuitive or consistent.  Use <b>--sort </b>and <b>--rsort </b>to
              control display order.  The <b>--names</b>/<b>--no-names </b>and
              <b>--stats</b>/<b>--no-stats </b>options also affect output formatting.
              See the descriptions of these options, under <b>OPTIONS</b>
              below, for more information

       <b>dump-aggregate </b><i>switch</i> [<i>flows</i>]
              Prints to the console aggregate statistics for flows in
              <i>switch</i>'s tables that match <i>flows</i>.  If <i>flows</i> is omitted,
              the statistics are aggregated across all flows in the
              switch's flow tables.  See <b>Flow Syntax</b>, below, for the
              syntax of <i>flows</i>.  The output format is described in <b>Table</b>
              <b>Entry Output</b>.

       <b>queue-stats </b><i>switch</i> [<i>port</i> [<i>queue</i>]]
              Prints to the console statistics for the specified <i>queue</i>
              on <i>port</i> within <i>switch</i>.  <i>port</i> can be an OpenFlow port
              number or name, the keyword <b>LOCAL </b>(the preferred way to
              refer to the OpenFlow local port), or the keyword <b>ALL</b>.
              Either of <i>port</i> or <i>queue</i> or both may be omitted (or
              equivalently the keyword <b>ALL</b>).  If both are omitted,
              statistics are printed for all queues on all ports.  If
              only <i>queue</i> is omitted, then statistics are printed for all
              queues on <i>port</i>; if only <i>port</i> is omitted, then statistics
              are printed for <i>queue</i> on every port where it exists.

       <b>queue-get-config </b><i>switch [port</i> [<i>queue</i>]]
              Prints to the console the configuration of <i>queue</i> on <i>port</i>
              in <i>switch</i>.  If <i>port</i> is omitted or <b>ANY</b>, reports queues for
              all port.  If <i>queue</i> is omitted or <b>ANY</b>, reports all queues.
              For OpenFlow 1.3 and earlier, the output always includes
              all queues, ignoring <i>queue</i> if specified.

              This command has limited usefulness, because ports often
              have no configured queues and because the OpenFlow
              protocol provides only very limited information about the
              configuration of a queue.

       <b>dump-ipfix-bridge </b><i>switch</i>
              Prints to the console the statistics of bridge IPFIX for
              <i>switch</i>.  If bridge IPFIX is configured on the <i>switch</i>,
              IPFIX statistics can be retrieved.  Otherwise, error
              message will be printed.

              This command uses an Open vSwitch extension that is only
              in Open vSwitch 2.6 and later.

       <b>dump-ipfix-flow </b><i>switch</i>
              Prints to the console the statistics of flow-based IPFIX
              for <i>switch</i>.  If flow-based IPFIX is configured on the
              <i>switch</i>, statistics of all the collector set ids on the
              <i>switch</i> will be printed.  Otherwise, print error message.

              Refer to <a href="../man5/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</a> for more details on
              configuring flow based IPFIX and collector set ids.

              This command uses an Open vSwitch extension that is only
              in Open vSwitch 2.6 and later.

       <b>ct-flush-zone </b><i>switch zone</i>
              Flushes the connection tracking entries in <i>zone</i> on <i>switch</i>.

              This command uses an Open vSwitch extension that is only
              in Open vSwitch 2.6 and later.

       <b>ct-flush </b><i>switch [zone=N] [mark=X[/M]] [labels=Y[/N]] [ct-orig-</i>
       <i>tuple [ct-reply-tuple]]</i>
              Flushes the connection entries on <i>switch</i> based on <i>zone</i>,
              <i>mark</i>, <i>labels</i> and connection tracking tuples
              <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i>.

              If <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i> is not provided, flushes all the
              connection entries.  If <i>zone</i> is specified, only flushes
              the connections in <i>zone</i>. if <i>mark</i> or <i>labels</i> is provided, it
              will flush only entries that are matching specific
              <i>mark/labels</i>.

              If <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i> is provided, flushes the
              connection entry specified by <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i> in
              <i>zone</i>.  The zone defaults to 0 if it is not provided.  The
              <i>mark</i> and <i>labels</i> defaults to "0/0" if it is not provided.
              The userspace connection tracker requires flushing with
              the original pre-NATed tuple and a warning log will be
              otherwise generated.  The tuple can be partial and will
              remove all connections that are matching on the specified
              fields.  In order to specify only <i>ct-reply-tuple</i>, provide
              empty string as <i>ct-orig-tuple</i>.

              Note: Currently there is limitation for matching on ICMP,
              in order to partially match on ICMP parameters the
              <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i> has to include either source or
              destination IP.

              An example of an IPv4 ICMP <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i>:

              "ct_nw_src=10.1.1.1,ct_nw_dst=10.1.1.2,ct_nw_proto=1,icmp_type=8,icmp_code=0,icmp_id=10"

              An example of an IPv6 TCP <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i>:

              "ct_ipv6_src=fc00::1,ct_ipv6_dst=fc00::2,ct_nw_proto=6,ct_tp_src=1,ct_tp_dst=2"

              This command uses an Open vSwitch extension that is only
              in Open vSwitch 3.1 and later.  Support for matching on
              <i>mark</i> and <i>labels</i> is only in Open vSwitch 3.3 and later.

   <b>OpenFlow Switch Flow Table Commands</b>
       These commands manage the flow table in an OpenFlow switch.  In
       each case, <i>flow</i> specifies a flow entry in the format described in
       <b>Flow Syntax</b>, below, <i>file</i> is a text file that contains zero or
       more flows in the same syntax, one per line, and the optional
       <b>--bundle </b>option operates the command as a single atomic
       transaction, see option <b>--bundle</b>, below.

       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>add-flow </b><i>switch flow</i>
       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>add-flow </b><i>switch</i> <b>- &lt; </b><i>file</i>
       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>add-flows </b><i>switch file</i>
              Add each flow entry to <i>switch</i>'s tables.  Each flow
              specification (e.g., each line in <i>file</i>) may start with
              <b>add</b>, <b>modify</b>, <b>delete</b>, <b>modify_strict</b>, or <b>delete_strict</b>
              keyword to specify whether a flow is to be added,
              modified, or deleted, and whether the modify or delete is
              strict or not.  For backwards compatibility a flow
              specification without one of these keywords is treated as
              a flow add.  All flow mods are executed in the order
              specified.

       [<b>--bundle</b>] [<b>--strict</b>] <b>mod-flows </b><i>switch flow</i>
       [<b>--bundle</b>] [<b>--strict</b>] <b>mod-flows </b><i>switch</i> <b>- &lt; </b><i>file</i>
              Modify the actions in entries from <i>switch</i>'s tables that
              match the specified flows.  With <b>--strict</b>, wildcards are
              not treated as active for matching purposes.

       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>del-flows </b><i>switch</i>
       [<b>--bundle</b>] [<b>--strict</b>] <b>del-flows </b><i>switch</i> [<i>flow</i>]
       [<b>--bundle</b>] [<b>--strict</b>] <b>del-flows </b><i>switch</i> <b>- &lt; </b><i>file</i>
              Deletes entries from <i>switch</i>'s flow table.  With only a
              <i>switch</i> argument, deletes all flows.  Otherwise, deletes
              flow entries that match the specified flows.  With
              <b>--strict</b>, wildcards are not treated as active for matching
              purposes.

       [<b>--bundle</b>] [<b>--readd</b>] <b>replace-flows </b><i>switch file</i>
              Reads flow entries from <i>file</i> (or <b>stdin </b>if <i>file</i> is <b>-</b>) and
              queries the flow table from <i>switch</i>.  Then it fixes up any
              differences, adding flows from <i>flow</i> that are missing on
              <i>switch</i>, deleting flows from <i>switch</i> that are not in <i>file</i>,
              and updating flows in <i>switch</i> whose actions, cookie, or
              timeouts differ in <i>file</i>.

              With <b>--readd</b>, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>adds all the flows from <i>file</i>, even
              those that exist with the same actions, cookie, and
              timeout in <i>switch</i>.  In OpenFlow 1.0 and 1.1, re-adding a
              flow always resets the flow's packet and byte counters to
              0, and in OpenFlow 1.2 and later, it does so only if the
              <b>reset_counts </b>flag is set.

       <b>diff-flows </b><i>source1 source2</i>
              Reads flow entries from <i>source1</i> and <i>source2</i> and prints the
              differences.  A flow that is in <i>source1</i> but not in <i>source2</i>
              is printed preceded by a <b>-</b>, and a flow that is in <i>source2</i>
              but not in <i>source1</i> is printed preceded by a <b>+</b>.  If a flow
              exists in both <i>source1</i> and <i>source2</i> with different actions,
              cookie, or timeouts, then both versions are printed
              preceded by <b>- </b>and <b>+</b>, respectively.

              <i>source1</i> and <i>source2</i> may each name a file or a switch.  If
              a name begins with <b>/ </b>or <b>.</b>, then it is considered to be a
              file name.  A name that contains <b>: </b>is considered to be a
              switch.  Otherwise, it is a file if a file by that name
              exists, a switch if not.

              For this command, an exit status of 0 means that no
              differences were found, 1 means that an error occurred,
              and 2 means that some differences were found.

       <b>packet-out </b><i>switch packet-out</i>
              Connects to <i>switch</i> and instructs it to execute the <i>packet-</i>
              <i>out</i> OpenFlow message, specified as defined in <b>Packet-Out</b>
              <b>Syntax </b>section.

   <b>Group Table Commands</b>
       These commands manage the group table in an OpenFlow switch.  In
       each case, <i>group</i> specifies a group entry in the format described
       in <b>Group Syntax</b>, below, and <i>file</i> is a text file that contains
       zero or more groups in the same syntax, one per line, and the
       optional <b>--bundle </b>option operates the command as a single atomic
       transaction, see option <b>--bundle</b>, below.

       The group commands work only with switches that support OpenFlow
       1.1 or later or the Open vSwitch group extensions to OpenFlow 1.0
       (added in Open vSwitch 2.9.90).  For OpenFlow 1.1 or later, it is
       necessary to explicitly enable these protocol versions in
       <b>ovs-ofctl </b>(using <b>-O</b>).  For more information, see ``Q: What
       versions of OpenFlow does Open vSwitch support?'' in the Open
       vSwitch FAQ.

       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>add-group </b><i>switch group</i>
       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>add-group </b><i>switch</i> <b>- &lt; </b><i>file</i>
       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>add-groups </b><i>switch file</i>
              Add each group entry to <i>switch</i>'s tables.  Each group
              specification (e.g., each line in <i>file</i>) may start with
              <b>add</b>, <b>modify</b>, <b>add_or_mod</b>, <b>delete</b>, <b>insert_bucket</b>, or
              <b>remove_bucket </b>keyword to specify whether a flow is to be
              added, modified, or deleted, or whether a group bucket is
              to be added or removed.  For backwards compatibility a
              group specification without one of these keywords is
              treated as a group add.  All group mods are executed in
              the order specified.

       [<b>--bundle</b>] [<b>--may-create</b>] <b>mod-group </b><i>switch group</i>
       [<b>--bundle</b>] [<b>--may-create</b>] <b>mod-group </b><i>switch</i> <b>- &lt; </b><i>file</i>
              Modify the action buckets in entries from <i>switch</i>'s tables
              for each group entry.  If a specified group does not
              already exist, then without <b>--may-create</b>, this command has
              no effect; with <b>--may-create</b>, it creates a new group.  The
              <b>--may-create </b>option uses an Open vSwitch extension to
              OpenFlow only implemented in Open vSwitch 2.6 and later.

       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>del-groups </b><i>switch</i>
       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>del-groups </b><i>switch</i> [<i>group</i>]
       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>del-groups </b><i>switch</i> <b>- &lt; </b><i>file</i>
              Deletes entries from <i>switch</i>'s group table.  With only a
              <i>switch</i> argument, deletes all groups.  Otherwise, deletes
              the group for each group entry.

       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>insert-buckets </b><i>switch group</i>
       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>insert-buckets </b><i>switch</i> <b>- &lt; </b><i>file</i>
              Add buckets to an existing group present in the <i>switch</i>'s
              group table.  If no <i>command_bucket_id</i> is present in the
              group specification then all buckets of the group are
              removed.

       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>remove-buckets </b><i>switch group</i>
       [<b>--bundle</b>] <b>remove-buckets </b><i>switch</i> <b>- &lt; </b><i>file</i>
              Remove buckets to an existing group present in the
              <i>switch</i>'s group table.  If no <i>command_bucket_id</i> is present
              in the group specification then all buckets of the group
              are removed.

       <b>dump-groups </b><i>switch</i> [<i>group</i>]
              Prints group entries in <i>switch</i>'s tables to console.  To
              dump only a specific group, specify its number as <i>group</i>.
              Otherwise, if <i>group</i> is omitted, or if it is specified as
              <b>ALL</b>, then all groups are printed.

              Only OpenFlow 1.5 and later support dumping a specific
              group.  Earlier versions of OpenFlow always dump all
              groups.

       <b>dump-group-features </b><i>switch</i>
              Prints to the console the group features of the <i>switch</i>.

       <b>dump-group-stats </b><i>switch</i> [<i>group</i>]
              Prints to the console statistics for the specified <i>group</i>
              in <i>switch</i>'s tables.  If <i>group</i> is omitted then statistics
              for all groups are printed.

   <b>OpenFlow 1.3+ Switch Meter Table Commands</b>
       These commands manage the meter table in an OpenFlow switch.  In
       each case, <i>meter</i> specifies a meter entry in the format described
       in <b>Meter Syntax</b>, below.

       OpenFlow 1.3 introduced support for meters, so these commands
       only work with switches that support OpenFlow 1.3 or later.  It
       is necessary to explicitly enable these protocol versions in
       <b>ovs-ofctl </b>(using <b>-O</b>) and in the switch itself (with the <b>protocols</b>
       column in the <b>Bridge </b>table).  For more information, see ``Q: What
       versions of OpenFlow does Open vSwitch support?'' in the Open
       vSwitch FAQ.

       <b>add-meter </b><i>switch meter</i>
              Add a meter entry to <i>switch</i>'s tables. The <i>meter</i> syntax is
              described in section <b>Meter Syntax</b>, below.

       <b>mod-meter </b><i>switch meter</i>
              Modify an existing meter.

       <b>del-meters </b><i>switch</i> [<i>meter</i>]
              Delete entries from <i>switch</i>'s meter table.  To delete only
              a specific meter, specify its number as <i>meter</i>.  Otherwise,
              if <i>meter</i> is omitted, or if it is specified as <b>all</b>, then
              all meters are deleted.

       <b>dump-meters </b><i>switch</i> [<i>meter</i>]
              Print entries from <i>switch</i>'s meter table.  To print only a
              specific meter, specify its number as <i>meter</i>.  Otherwise,
              if <i>meter</i> is omitted, or if it is specified as <b>all</b>, then
              all meters are printed.

       <b>meter-stats </b><i>switch</i> [<i>meter</i>]
              Print meter statistics.  <i>meter</i> can specify a single meter
              with syntax <b>meter=</b><i>id</i>, or all meters with syntax <b>meter=all</b>.

       <b>meter-features </b><i>switch</i>
              Print meter features.

   <b>OpenFlow Switch Bundle Command</b>
       Transactional updates to both flow and group tables can be made
       with the <b>bundle </b>command.  <i>file</i> is a text file that contains zero
       or more flow mods, group mods, or packet-outs in <b>Flow Syntax</b>,
       <b>Group Syntax</b>, or <b>Packet-Out Syntax</b>, each line preceded by <b>flow</b>,
       <b>group</b>, or <b>packet-out </b>keyword, correspondingly.  The <b>flow </b>keyword
       may be optionally followed by one of the keywords <b>add</b>, <b>modify</b>,
       <b>modify_strict</b>, <b>delete</b>, or <b>delete_strict</b>, of which the <b>add </b>is
       assumed if a bare <b>flow </b>is given.  Similarly, the <b>group </b>keyword
       may be optionally followed by one of the keywords <b>add</b>, <b>modify</b>,
       <b>add_or_mod</b>, <b>delete</b>, <b>insert_bucket</b>, or <b>remove_bucket</b>, of which the
       <b>add </b>is assumed if a bare <b>group </b>is given.

       <b>bundle </b><i>switch file</i>
              Execute all flow and group mods in <i>file</i> as a single atomic
              transaction against <i>switch</i>'s tables.  All bundled mods are
              executed in the order specified.

   <b>OpenFlow Switch Tunnel TLV Table Commands</b>
       Open vSwitch maintains a mapping table between tunnel option TLVs
       (defined by &lt;class, type, length&gt;) and NXM fields <b>tun_metadata</b><i>n</i>,
       where <i>n</i> ranges from 0 to 63, that can be operated on for the
       purposes of matches, actions, etc. This TLV table can be used for
       Geneve option TLVs or other protocols with options in same TLV
       format as Geneve options. This mapping must be explicitly
       specified by the user through the following commands.

       A TLV mapping is specified with the syntax
       <b>{class=</b><i>class</i><b>,type=</b><i>type</i><b>,len=</b><i>length</i><b>}-&gt;tun_metadata</b><i>n</i>.  When an
       option mapping exists for a given <b>tun_metadata</b><i>n</i>, matching on the
       defined field becomes possible, e.g.:

              ovs-ofctl add-tlv-map br0
              "{class=0xffff,type=0,len=4}-&gt;tun_metadata0"

              ovs-ofctl add-flow br0
              tun_metadata0=1234,actions=controller

       A mapping should not be changed while it is in active use by a
       flow. The result of doing so is undefined.

       These commands are Nicira extensions to OpenFlow and require Open
       vSwitch 2.5 or later.

       <b>add-tlv-map </b><i>switch option</i>[<b>,</b><i>option</i>]...
              Add each <i>option</i> to <i>switch</i>'s tables. Duplicate fields are
              rejected.

       <b>del-tlv-map </b><i>switch</i> [<i>option</i>[<b>,</b><i>option</i>]]...
              Delete each <i>option</i> from <i>switch</i>'s table, or all option TLV
              mapping if no <i>option</i> is specified.  Fields that aren't
              mapped are ignored.

       <b>dump-tlv-map </b><i>switch</i>
              Show the currently mapped fields in the switch's option
              table as well as switch capabilities.

   <b>OpenFlow Switch Monitoring Commands</b>
       <b>snoop </b><i>switch</i>
              Connects to <i>switch</i> and prints to the console all OpenFlow
              messages received.  Unlike other <b>ovs-ofctl </b>commands, if
              <i>switch</i> is the name of a bridge, then the <b>snoop </b>command
              connects to a Unix domain socket named
              <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/</b><i>switch</i><b>.snoop</b>.  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
              listens on such a socket for each bridge and sends to it
              all of the OpenFlow messages sent to or received from its
              configured OpenFlow controller.  Thus, this command can be
              used to view OpenFlow protocol activity between a switch
              and its controller.

              When a switch has more than one controller configured,
              only the traffic to and from a single controller is
              output.  If none of the controllers is configured as a
              primary or a secondary (using a Nicira extension to
              OpenFlow 1.0 or 1.1, or a standard request in OpenFlow 1.2
              or later), then a controller is chosen arbitrarily among
              them.  If there is a primary controller, it is chosen;
              otherwise, if there are any controllers that are not
              primaries or secondaries, one is chosen arbitrarily;
              otherwise, a secondary controller is chosen arbitrarily.
              This choice is made once at connection time and does not
              change as controllers reconfigure their roles.

              If a switch has no controller configured, or if the
              configured controller is disconnected, no traffic is sent,
              so monitoring will not show any traffic.

       <b>monitor </b><i>switch</i> [<i>miss-len</i>] [<b>invalid_ttl</b>] [<b>watch:</b>[<i>spec</i>...]]
              Connects to <i>switch</i> and prints to the console all OpenFlow
              messages received.  Usually, <i>switch</i> should specify the
              name of a bridge in the <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>database. This is
              available only in OpenFlow 1.0 as Nicira extension.

              If <i>miss-len</i> is provided, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>sends an OpenFlow ``set
              configuration'' message at connection setup time that
              requests <i>miss-len</i> bytes of each packet that misses the
              flow table.  Open vSwitch does not send these and other
              asynchronous messages to an <b>ovs-ofctl monitor </b>client
              connection unless a nonzero value is specified on this
              argument.  (Thus, if <i>miss-len</i> is not specified, very
              little traffic will ordinarily be printed.)

              If <b>invalid_ttl </b>is passed, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>sends an OpenFlow
              ``set configuration'' message at connection setup time
              that requests <b>INVALID_TTL_TO_CONTROLLER</b>, so that <b>ovs-ofctl</b>
              <b>monitor </b>can receive ``packet-in'' messages when TTL
              reaches zero on <b>dec_ttl </b>action.  Only OpenFlow 1.1 and 1.2
              support <b>invalid_ttl</b>; Open vSwitch also implements it for
              OpenFlow 1.0 as an extension.

              <b>watch:</b>[<i>spec</i>...] causes <b>ovs-ofctl </b>to send a ``monitor
              request'' Nicira extension message to the switch at
              connection setup time.  This message causes the switch to
              send information about flow table changes as they occur.
              The following comma-separated <i>spec</i> syntax is available:

              <b>!initial</b>
                     Do not report the switch's initial flow table
                     contents.

              <b>!add   </b>Do not report newly added flows.

              <b>!delete</b>
                     Do not report deleted flows.

              <b>!modify</b>
                     Do not report modifications to existing flows.

              <b>!own   </b>Abbreviate changes made to the flow table by
                     <b>ovs-ofctl</b>'s own connection to the switch.  (These
                     could only occur using the <b>ofctl/send </b>command
                     described below under <b>RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS</b>.)

              <b>!actions</b>
                     Do not report actions as part of flow updates.

              <b>table=</b><i>table</i>
                     Limits the monitoring to the table with the given
                     <i>table</i>, which may be expressed as a number between 0
                     and 254 or (unless <b>--no-names </b>is specified) a name.
                     By default, all tables are monitored.

              <b>out_port=</b><i>port</i>
                     If set, only flows that output to <i>port</i> are
                     monitored.  The <i>port</i> may be an OpenFlow port number
                     or keyword (e.g. <b>LOCAL</b>).

              <b>out_group=</b><i>group</i>
                     If set, only flows that output to <i>group</i> number are
                     monitored.  This field requires OpenFlow 1.4
                     (-OOpenFlow14) or later.

              <i>field</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
                     Monitors only flows that have <i>field</i> specified as
                     the given <i>value</i>.  Any syntax valid for matching on
                     <b>dump-flows </b>may be used.

              This command may be useful for debugging switch or
              controller implementations.  With <b>watch:</b>, it is
              particularly useful for observing how a controller updates
              flow tables.

   <b>OpenFlow Switch and Controller Commands</b>
       The following commands, like those in the previous section, may
       be applied to OpenFlow switches, using any of the connection
       methods described in that section.  Unlike those commands, these
       may also be applied to OpenFlow controllers.

       <b>probe </b><i>target</i>
              Sends a single OpenFlow echo-request message to <i>target</i> and
              waits for the response.  With the <b>-t </b>or <b>--timeout </b>option,
              this command can test whether an OpenFlow switch or
              controller is up and running.

       <b>ping </b><i>target</i> [<i>n</i>]
              Sends a series of 10 echo request packets to <i>target</i> and
              times each reply.  The echo request packets consist of an
              OpenFlow header plus <i>n</i> bytes (default: 64) of randomly
              generated payload.  This measures the latency of
              individual requests.

       <b>benchmark </b><i>target n count</i>
              Sends <i>count</i> echo request packets that each consist of an
              OpenFlow header plus <i>n</i> bytes of payload and waits for each
              response.  Reports the total time required.  This is a
              measure of the maximum bandwidth to <i>target</i> for round-trips
              of <i>n</i>-byte messages.

   <b>Other Commands</b>
       <b>ofp-parse </b><i>file</i>
              Reads <i>file</i> (or <b>stdin </b>if <i>file</i> is <b>-</b>) as a series of OpenFlow
              messages in the binary format used on an OpenFlow
              connection, and prints them to the console.  This can be
              useful for printing OpenFlow messages captured from a TCP
              stream.

       <b>ofp-parse-pcap </b><i>file</i> [<i>port</i>...]
              Reads <i>file</i>, which must be in the PCAP format used by
              network capture tools such as <b>tcpdump </b>or <b>wireshark</b>,
              extracts all the TCP streams for OpenFlow connections, and
              prints the OpenFlow messages in those connections in
              human-readable format on <b>stdout</b>.

              OpenFlow connections are distinguished by TCP port number.
              Non-OpenFlow packets are ignored.  By default, data on TCP
              ports 6633 and 6653 are considered to be OpenFlow.
              Specify one or more <i>port</i> arguments to override the
              default.

              This command cannot usefully print SSL encrypted traffic.
              It does not understand IPv6.

   <b>Flow Syntax</b>
       Some <b>ovs-ofctl </b>commands accept an argument that describes a flow
       or flows.  Such flow descriptions comprise a series of
       <i>field</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> assignments, separated by commas or white space.
       (Embedding spaces into a flow description normally requires
       quoting to prevent the shell from breaking the description into
       multiple arguments.)

       Flow descriptions should be in <b>normal form</b>.  This means that a
       flow may only specify a value for an L3 field if it also
       specifies a particular L2 protocol, and that a flow may only
       specify an L4 field if it also specifies particular L2 and L3
       protocol types.  For example, if the L2 protocol type <b>dl_type </b>is
       wildcarded, then L3 fields <b>nw_src</b>, <b>nw_dst</b>, and <b>nw_proto </b>must also
       be wildcarded.  Similarly, if <b>dl_type </b>or <b>nw_proto </b>(the L3
       protocol type) is wildcarded, so must be the L4 fields <b>tcp_dst</b>
       and <b>tcp_src</b>.  <b>ovs-ofctl </b>will warn about flows not in normal form.

       <a href="../man7/ovs-fields.7.html">ovs-fields(7)</a> describes the supported fields and how to match
       them.  In addition to match fields, commands that operate on
       flows accept a few additional key-value pairs:

       <b>table=</b><i>table</i>
              For flow dump commands, limits the flows dumped to those
              in <i>table</i>, which may be expressed as a number between 0 and
              255 or (unless <b>--no-names </b>is specified) a name.  If not
              specified (or if 255 is specified as <i>table</i>), then flows in
              all tables are dumped.

              For flow table modification commands, behavior varies
              based on the OpenFlow version used to connect to the
              switch:

              OpenFlow 1.0
                     OpenFlow 1.0 does not support <b>table </b>for modifying
                     flows.  <b>ovs-ofctl </b>will exit with an error if <b>table</b>
                     (other than <b>table=255</b>) is specified for a switch
                     that only supports OpenFlow 1.0.

                     In OpenFlow 1.0, the switch chooses the table into
                     which to insert a new flow.  The Open vSwitch
                     software switch always chooses table 0.  Other Open
                     vSwitch datapaths and other OpenFlow
                     implementations may choose different tables.

                     The OpenFlow 1.0 behavior in Open vSwitch for
                     modifying or removing flows depends on whether
                     <b>--strict </b>is used.  Without <b>--strict</b>, the command
                     applies to matching flows in all tables.  With
                     <b>--strict</b>, the command will operate on any single
                     matching flow in any table; it will do nothing if
                     there are matches in more than one table.  (The
                     distinction between these behaviors only matters if
                     non-OpenFlow 1.0 commands were also used, because
                     OpenFlow 1.0 alone cannot add flows with the same
                     matching criteria to multiple tables.)

              OpenFlow 1.0 with table_id extension
                     Open vSwitch implements an OpenFlow extension that
                     allows the controller to specify the table on which
                     to operate.  <b>ovs-ofctl </b>automatically enables the
                     extension when <b>table </b>is specified and OpenFlow 1.0
                     is used.  <b>ovs-ofctl </b>automatically detects whether
                     the switch supports the extension.  As of this
                     writing, this extension is only known to be
                     implemented by Open vSwitch.

                     With this extension, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>operates on the
                     requested table when <b>table </b>is specified, and acts
                     as described for OpenFlow 1.0 above when no <b>table</b>
                     is specified (or for <b>table=255</b>).

              OpenFlow 1.1
                     OpenFlow 1.1 requires flow table modification
                     commands to specify a table.  When <b>table </b>is not
                     specified (or <b>table=255 </b>is specified), <b>ovs-ofctl</b>
                     defaults to table 0.

              OpenFlow 1.2 and later
                     OpenFlow 1.2 and later allow flow deletion
                     commands, but not other flow table modification
                     commands, to operate on all flow tables, with the
                     behavior described above for OpenFlow 1.0.

       <b>duration=</b>...
       <b>n_packet=</b>...
       <b>n_bytes=</b>...
              <b>ovs-ofctl </b>ignores assignments to these ``fields'' to allow
              output from the <b>dump-flows </b>command to be used as input for
              other commands that parse flows.

       The <b>add-flow</b>, <b>add-flows</b>, and <b>mod-flows </b>commands require an
       additional field, which must be the final field specified:

       <b>actions=</b>[<i>action</i>][<b>,</b><i>action</i>...]
              Specifies a comma-separated list of actions to take on a
              packet when the flow entry matches.  If no <i>action</i> is
              specified, then packets matching the flow are dropped.
              See <a href="../man7/ovs-actions.7.html">ovs-actions(7)</a> for details on the syntax and semantics
              of actions.  K

       An opaque identifier called a cookie can be used as a handle to
       identify a set of flows:

       <b>cookie=</b><i>value</i>
              A cookie can be associated with a flow using the <b>add-flow</b>,
              <b>add-flows</b>, and <b>mod-flows </b>commands.  <i>value</i> can be any
              64-bit number and need not be unique among flows.  If this
              field is omitted, a default cookie value of 0 is used.

       <b>cookie=</b><i>value</i><b>/</b><i>mask</i>
              When using NXM, the cookie can be used as a handle for
              querying, modifying, and deleting flows.  <i>value</i> and <i>mask</i>
              may be supplied for the <b>del-flows</b>, <b>mod-flows</b>, <b>dump-flows</b>,
              and <b>dump-aggregate </b>commands to limit matching cookies.  A
              1-bit in <i>mask</i> indicates that the corresponding bit in
              <i>cookie</i> must match exactly, and a 0-bit wildcards that bit.
              A mask of -1 may be used to exactly match a cookie.

              The <b>mod-flows </b>command can update the cookies of flows that
              match a cookie by specifying the <i>cookie</i> field twice (once
              with a mask for matching and once without to indicate the
              new value):

              <b>ovs-ofctl mod-flows br0 cookie=1,actions=normal</b>
                     Change all flows' cookies to 1 and change their
                     actions to <b>normal</b>.

              <b>ovs-ofctl mod-flows br0</b>
              <b>cookie=1/-1,cookie=2,actions=normal</b>
                     Update cookies with a value of 1 to 2 and change
                     their actions to <b>normal</b>.

              The ability to match on cookies was added in Open vSwitch
              1.5.0.

       The following additional field sets the priority for flows added
       by the <b>add-flow </b>and <b>add-flows </b>commands.  For <b>mod-flows </b>and
       <b>del-flows </b>when <b>--strict </b>is specified, priority must match along
       with the rest of the flow specification.  For <b>mod-flows </b>without
       <b>--strict</b>, priority is only significant if the command creates a
       new flow, that is, non-strict <b>mod-flows </b>does not match on
       priority and will not change the priority of existing flows.
       Other commands do not allow priority to be specified.

       <b>priority=</b><i>value</i>
              The priority at which a wildcarded entry will match in
              comparison to others.  <i>value</i> is a number between 0 and
              65535, inclusive.  A higher <i>value</i> will match before a
              lower one.  An exact-match entry will always have priority
              over an entry containing wildcards, so it has an implicit
              priority value of 65535.  When adding a flow, if the field
              is not specified, the flow's priority will default to
              32768.

              OpenFlow leaves behavior undefined when two or more flows
              with the same priority can match a single packet.  Some
              users expect ``sensible'' behavior, such as more specific
              flows taking precedence over less specific flows, but
              OpenFlow does not specify this and Open vSwitch does not
              implement it.  Users should therefore take care to use
              priorities to ensure the behavior that they expect.

       The <b>add-flow</b>, <b>add-flows</b>, and <b>mod-flows </b>commands support the
       following additional options.  These options affect only new
       flows.  Thus, for <b>add-flow </b>and <b>add-flows</b>, these options are
       always significant, but for <b>mod-flows </b>they are significant only
       if the command creates a new flow, that is, their values do not
       update or affect existing flows.

       <b>idle_timeout=</b><i>seconds</i>
              Causes the flow to expire after the given number of
              seconds of inactivity.  A value of 0 (the default)
              prevents a flow from expiring due to inactivity.

       <b>hard_timeout=</b><i>seconds</i>
              Causes the flow to expire after the given number of
              seconds, regardless of activity.  A value of 0 (the
              default) gives the flow no hard expiration deadline.

       <b>importance=</b><i>value</i>
              Sets the importance of a flow.  The flow entry eviction
              mechanism can use importance as a factor in deciding which
              flow to evict.  A value of 0 (the default) makes the flow
              non-evictable on the basis of importance.  Specify a value
              between 0 and 65535.

              Only OpenFlow 1.4 and later support <b>importance</b>.

       <b>send_flow_rem</b>
              Marks the flow with a flag that causes the switch to
              generate a ``flow removed'' message and send it to
              interested controllers when the flow later expires or is
              removed.

       <b>check_overlap</b>
              Forces the switch to check that the flow match does not
              overlap that of any different flow with the same priority
              in the same table.  (This check is expensive so it is best
              to avoid it.)

       <b>reset_counts</b>
              When this flag is specified on a flow being added to a
              switch, and the switch already has a flow with an
              identical match, an OpenFlow 1.2 (or later) switch resets
              the flow's packet and byte counters to 0.  Without the
              flag, the packet and byte counters are preserved.

              OpenFlow 1.0 and 1.1 switches always reset counters in
              this situation, as if <b>reset_counts </b>were always specified.

              Open vSwitch 1.10 added support for <b>reset_counts</b>.

       <b>no_packet_counts</b>
       <b>no_byte_counts</b>
              Adding these flags to a flow advises an OpenFlow 1.3 (or
              later) switch that the controller does not need packet or
              byte counters, respectively, for the flow.  Some switch
              implementations might achieve higher performance or reduce
              resource consumption when these flags are used.  These
              flags provide no benefit to the Open vSwitch software
              switch implementation.

              OpenFlow 1.2 and earlier do not support these flags.

              Open vSwitch 1.10 added support for <b>no_packet_counts </b>and
              <b>no_byte_counts</b>.

       The <b>dump-flows</b>, <b>dump-aggregate</b>, <b>del-flow </b>and <b>del-flows </b>commands
       support these additional optional fields:

       <b>out_port=</b><i>port</i>
              If set, a matching flow must include an output action to
              <i>port</i>, which must be an OpenFlow port number or name (e.g.
              <b>local</b>).

       <b>out_group=</b><i>group</i>
              If set, a matching flow must include an <b>group </b>action
              naming <i>group</i>, which must be an OpenFlow group number.
              This field is supported in Open vSwitch 2.5 and later and
              requires OpenFlow 1.1 or later.

   <b>Table Entry Output</b>
       The <b>dump-tables </b>and <b>dump-aggregate </b>commands print information
       about the entries in a datapath's tables.  Each line of output is
       a flow entry as described in <b>Flow Syntax</b>, above, plus some
       additional fields:

       <b>duration=</b><i>secs</i>
              The time, in seconds, that the entry has been in the
              table.  <i>secs</i> includes as much precision as the switch
              provides, possibly to nanosecond resolution.

       <b>n_packets</b>
              The number of packets that have matched the entry.

       <b>n_bytes</b>
              The total number of bytes from packets that have matched
              the entry.

       The following additional fields are included only if the switch
       is Open vSwitch 1.6 or later and the NXM flow format is used to
       dump the flow (see the description of the <b>--flow-format </b>option
       below).  The values of these additional fields are approximations
       only and in particular <b>idle_age </b>will sometimes become nonzero
       even for busy flows.

       <b>hard_age=</b><i>secs</i>
              The integer number of seconds since the flow was added or
              modified.  <b>hard_age </b>is displayed only if it differs from
              the integer part of <b>duration</b>.  (This is separate from
              <b>duration </b>because <b>mod-flows </b>restarts the <b>hard_timeout </b>timer
              without zeroing <b>duration</b>.)

       <b>idle_age=</b><i>secs</i>
              The integer number of seconds that have passed without any
              packets passing through the flow.

   <b>Packet-Out Syntax</b>
       <b>ovs-ofctl bundle </b>command accepts packet-outs to be specified in
       the bundle file.  Each packet-out comprises of a series of
       <i>field</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> assignments, separated by commas or white space.
       (Embedding spaces into a packet-out description normally requires
       quoting to prevent the shell from breaking the description into
       multiple arguments.).  Unless noted otherwise only the last
       instance of each field is honoured.  This same syntax is also
       supported by the <b>ovs-ofctl packet-out </b>command.

       <b>in_port=</b><i>port</i>
              The port number to be considered the in_port when
              processing actions.  This can be any valid OpenFlow port
              number, or any of the <b>LOCAL</b>, <b>CONTROLLER</b>, or <b>NONE</b>.  This
              field is required.

       <i>pipeline_field</i>=<i>value</i>
              Optionally, user can specify a list of pipeline fields for
              a packet-out message. The supported pipeline fields
              includes <b>tunnel fields </b>and <b>register fields </b>as defined in
              <a href="../man7/ovs-fields.7.html">ovs-fields(7)</a>.

       <b>packet=</b><i>hex-string</i>
              The actual packet to send, expressed as a string of
              hexadecimal bytes.  This field is required.

       <b>actions=</b>[<i>action</i>][<b>,</b><i>action</i>...]
              The syntax of actions are identical to the <b>actions= </b>field
              described in <b>Flow Syntax </b>above.  Specifying <b>actions= </b>is
              optional, but omitting actions is interpreted as a drop,
              so the packet will not be sent anywhere from the switch.
              <b>actions </b>must be specified at the end of each line, like
              for flow mods.

   <b>Group Syntax</b>
       Some <b>ovs-ofctl </b>commands accept an argument that describes a group
       or groups.  Such flow descriptions comprise a series <i>field</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
       assignments, separated by commas or white space.  (Embedding
       spaces into a group description normally requires quoting to
       prevent the shell from breaking the description into multiple
       arguments.). Unless noted otherwise only the last instance of
       each field is honoured.

       <b>group_id=</b><i>id</i>
              The integer group id of group.  When this field is
              specified in <b>del-groups </b>or <b>dump-groups</b>, the keyword "all"
              may be used to designate all groups.  This field is
              required.

       <b>type=</b><i>type</i>
              The type of the group.  The <b>add-group</b>, <b>add-groups </b>and <b>mod-</b>
              <b>groups </b>commands require this field.  It is prohibited for
              other commands. The following keywords designated the
              allowed types:

              <b>all    </b>Execute all buckets in the group.

              <b>select </b>Execute one bucket in the group, balancing across
                     the buckets according to their weights.  To select
                     a bucket, for each live bucket, Open vSwitch hashes
                     flow data with the bucket ID and multiplies by the
                     bucket weight to obtain a ``score,'' and then
                     selects the bucket with the highest score.  Use
                     <b>selection_method </b>to control the flow data used for
                     selection.

              <b>indirect</b>
                     Executes the one bucket in the group.

              <b>ff</b>
              <b>fast_failover</b>
                     Executes the first live bucket in the group which
                     is associated with a live port or group.

       <b>command_bucket_id=</b><i>id</i>
              The bucket to operate on.  The <b>insert-buckets </b>and <b>remove-</b>
              <b>buckets </b>commands require this field.  It is prohibited for
              other commands.  <i>id</i> may be an integer or one of the
              following keywords:

              <b>all    </b>Operate on all buckets in the group.  Only valid
                     when used with the <b>remove-buckets </b>command in which
                     case the effect is to remove all buckets from the
                     group.

              <b>first  </b>Operate on the first bucket present in the group.
                     In the case of the <b>insert-buckets </b>command the
                     effect is to insert new bucets just before the
                     first bucket already present in the group; or to
                     replace the buckets of the group if there are no
                     buckets already present in the group.  In the case
                     of the <b>remove-buckets </b>command the effect is to
                     remove the first bucket of the group; or do nothing
                     if there are no buckets present in the group.

              <b>last   </b>Operate on the last bucket present in the group.
                     In the case of the <b>insert-buckets </b>command the
                     effect is to insert new bucets just after the last
                     bucket already present in the group; or to replace
                     the buckets of the group if there are no buckets
                     already present in the group.  In the case of the
                     <b>remove-buckets </b>command the effect is to remove the
                     last bucket of the group; or do nothing if there
                     are no buckets present in the group.

              If <i>id</i> is an integer then it should correspond to the
              <b>bucket_id </b>of a bucket present in the group.  In case of
              the <b>insert-buckets </b>command the effect is to insert buckets
              just before the bucket in the group whose <b>bucket_id </b>is <i>id</i>.
              In case of the <b>iremove-buckets </b>command the effect is to
              remove the in the group whose <b>bucket_id </b>is <i>id</i>.  It is an
              error if there is no bucket persent group in whose
              <b>bucket_id </b>is <i>id</i>.

       <b>selection_method</b>=<i>method</i>
              The selection method used to select a bucket for a select
              group.  This is a string of 1 to 15 bytes in length known
              to lower layers.  This field is optional for <b>add-group</b>,
              <b>add-groups </b>and <b>mod-group </b>commands on groups of type
              <b>select</b>. Prohibited otherwise.  If no selection method is
              specified, Open vSwitch up to release 2.9 applies the <b>hash</b>
              method with default fields. From 2.10 onwards Open vSwitch
              defaults to the <b>dp_hash </b>method with symmetric L3/L4 hash
              algorithm, as long as the weighted group buckets can be
              mapped to dp_hash values with sufficient accuracy.  In
              2.10 this was restricted to a maximum of 64 buckets, and
              in 2.17 the limit was raised to 256 buckets.  In those
              rare cases Open vSwitch 2.10 and later fall back to the
              <b>hash </b>method with the default set of hash fields.

              <b>dp_hash</b>
                     Use a datapath computed hash value.  The hash
                     algorithm varies across different datapath
                     implementations.  <b>dp_hash </b>uses the upper 32 bits of
                     the <b>selection_method_param </b>as the datapath hash
                     algorithm selector.  The supported values are <b>0</b>
                     (corresponding to hash computation over the IP
                     5-tuple) and <b>1 </b>(corresponding to a <i>symmetric</i> hash
                     computation over the IP 5-tuple).  Selecting
                     specific fields with the <b>fields </b>option is not
                     supported with <b>dp_hash</b>).  The lower 32 bits are
                     used as the hash basis.

                     Using <b>dp_hash </b>has the advantage that it does not
                     require the generated datapath flows to exact match
                     any additional packet header fields.  For example,
                     even if multiple TCP connections thus hashed to
                     different select group buckets have different
                     source port numbers, generally all of them would be
                     handled with a small set of already established
                     datapath flows, resulting in less latency for TCP
                     SYN packets.  The downside is that the shared
                     datapath flows must match each packet twice, as the
                     datapath hash value calculation happens only when
                     needed, and a second match is required to match
                     some bits of its value.  This double-matching
                     incurs a small additional latency cost for each
                     packet, but this latency is orders of magnitude
                     less than the latency of creating new datapath
                     flows for new TCP connections.

              <b>hash   </b>Use a hash computed over the fields specified with
                     the <b>fields </b>option, see below.  If no hash fields
                     are specified, <b>hash </b>defaults to a symmetric hash
                     over the combination of MAC addresses, VLAN tags,
                     Ether type, IP addresses and L4 port numbers.  <b>hash</b>
                     uses the <b>selection_method_param </b>as the hash basis.

                     Note that the hashed fields become exact matched by
                     the datapath flows.  For example, if the TCP source
                     port is hashed, the created datapath flows will
                     match the specific TCP source port value present in
                     the packet received.  Since each TCP connection
                     generally has a different source port value, a
                     separate datapath flow will be need to be inserted
                     for each TCP connection thus hashed to a select
                     group bucket.

              This option uses a Netronome OpenFlow extension which is
              only supported when using Open vSwitch 2.4 and later with
              OpenFlow 1.5 and later.

       <b>selection_method_param</b>=<i>param</i>
              64-bit integer parameter to the selection method selected
              by the <b>selection_method </b>field.  The parameter's use is
              defined by the lower-layer that implements the
              <b>selection_method</b>.  It is optional if the <b>selection_method</b>
              field is specified as a non-empty string.  Prohibited
              otherwise. The default value is zero.

              This option uses a Netronome OpenFlow extension which is
              only supported when using Open vSwitch 2.4 and later with
              OpenFlow 1.5 and later.

       <b>fields</b>=<i>field</i>
       <b>fields(</b><i>field</i>[<b>=</b><i>mask</i>]...<b>)</b>
              The field parameters to selection method selected by the
              <b>selection_method </b>field.  The syntax is described in <b>Flow</b>
              <b>Syntax </b>with the additional restrictions that if a value is
              provided it is treated as a wildcard mask and wildcard
              masks following a slash are prohibited. The pre-requisites
              of fields must be provided by any flows that output to the
              group.  The use of the fields is defined by the lower-
              layer that implements the <b>selection_method</b>.  They are
              optional if the <b>selection_method </b>field is specified as
              ``hash', prohibited otherwise.  The default is no fields.

              This option will use a Netronome OpenFlow extension which
              is only supported when using Open vSwitch 2.4 and later
              with OpenFlow 1.5 and later.

       <b>bucket</b>=<i>bucket_parameters</i>
              The <b>add-group</b>, <b>add-groups </b>and <b>mod-group </b>commands require
              at least one bucket field. Bucket fields must appear after
              all other fields.  Multiple bucket fields to specify
              multiple buckets.  The order in which buckets are
              specified corresponds to their order in the group. If the
              type of the group is "indirect" then only one group may be
              specified.  <i>bucket_parameters</i> consists of a list of
              <i>field</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> assignments, separated by commas or white
              space followed by a comma-separated list of actions.  The
              fields for <i>bucket_parameters</i> are:

              <b>bucket_id=</b><i>id</i>
                     The 32-bit integer group id of the bucket.  Values
                     greater than 0xffffff00 are reserved.  This field
                     was added in Open vSwitch 2.4 to conform with the
                     OpenFlow 1.5 specification. It is not supported
                     when earlier versions of OpenFlow are used.  Open
                     vSwitch will automatically allocate bucket ids when
                     they are not specified.

              <b>actions=</b>[<i>action</i>][<b>,</b><i>action</i>...]
                     The syntax of actions are identical to the <b>actions=</b>
                     field described in <b>Flow Syntax </b>above. Specifying
                     <b>actions= </b>is optional, any unknown bucket parameter
                     will be interpreted as an action.

              <b>weight=</b><i>value</i>
                     The relative weight of the bucket as an integer.
                     This may be used by the switch during bucket select
                     for groups whose <b>type </b>is <b>select</b>.

              <b>watch_port=</b><i>port</i>
                     Port used to determine liveness of group.  This or
                     the <b>watch_group </b>field is required for groups whose
                     <b>type </b>is <b>ff </b>or <b>fast_failover</b>.  This or the
                     <b>watch_group </b>field can also be used for groups whose
                     <b>type </b>is <b>select</b>.

              <b>watch_group=</b><i>group_id</i>
                     Group identifier of group used to determine
                     liveness of group.  This or the <b>watch_port </b>field is
                     required for groups whose <b>type </b>is <b>ff </b>or
                     <b>fast_failover</b>.  This or the <b>watch_port </b>field can
                     also be used for groups whose <b>type </b>is <b>select</b>.

   <b>Meter Syntax</b>
       The meter table commands accept an argument that describes a
       meter.  Such meter descriptions comprise a series <i>field</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
       assignments, separated by commas or white space.  (Embedding
       spaces into a group description normally requires quoting to
       prevent the shell from breaking the description into multiple
       arguments.). Unless noted otherwise only the last instance of
       each field is honoured.

       <b>meter=</b><i>id</i>
              The identifier for the meter.  An integer is used to
              specify a user-defined meter.  In addition, the keywords
              "all", "controller", and "slowpath", are also supported as
              virtual meters.  The "controller" and "slowpath" virtual
              meters apply to packets sent to the controller and to the
              OVS userspace, respectively.

              When this field is specified in <b>del-meter</b>, <b>dump-meter</b>, or
              <b>meter-stats</b>, the keyword "all" may be used to designate
              all meters.  This field is required, except for <b>meter-</b>
              <b>stats</b>, which dumps all stats when this field is not
              specified.

       <b>kbps</b>
       <b>pktps  </b>The unit for the <b>rate </b>and <b>burst_size </b>band parameters.
              <b>kbps </b>specifies kilobits per second, and <b>pktps </b>specifies
              packets per second.  A unit is required for the <b>add-meter</b>
              and <b>mod-meter </b>commands.

       <b>burst  </b>If set, enables burst support for meter bands through the
              <b>burst_size </b>parameter.

       <b>stats  </b>If set, enables the collection of meter and band
              statistics.

       <b>bands</b>=<i>band_parameters</i>
              The <b>add-meter </b>and <b>mod-meter </b>commands require at least one
              band specification. Bands must appear after all other
              fields.

              <b>type=</b><i>type</i>
                     The type of the meter band.  This keyword starts a
                     new band specification.  Each band specifies a rate
                     above which the band is to take some action. The
                     action depends on the band type.  If multiple
                     bands' rate is exceeded, then the band with the
                     highest rate among the exceeded bands is selected.
                     The following keywords designate the allowed meter
                     band types:

                     <b>drop   </b>Drop packets exceeding the band's rate
                            limit.

              The other <i>band_parameters</i> are:

              <b>rate=</b><i>value</i>
                     The relative rate limit for this band, in kilobits
                     per second or packets per second, depending on
                     whether <b>kbps </b>or <b>pktps </b>was specified.

              <b>burst_size=</b><i>size</i>
                     If <b>burst </b>is specified for the meter entry,
                     configures the maximum burst allowed for the band
                     in kilobits or packets, depending on whether <b>kbps</b>
                     or <b>pktps </b>was specified.  If unspecified, the switch
                     is free to select some reasonable value depending
                     on its configuration.

       <b>--strict</b>
              Uses strict matching when running flow modification
              commands.

       <b>--names</b>
       <b>--no-names</b>
              Every OpenFlow port has a name and a number, and every
              OpenFlow flow table has a number and sometimes a name.  By
              default, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>commands accept both port and table
              names and numbers, and they display port and table names
              if <b>ovs-ofctl </b>is running on an interactive console, numbers
              otherwise.  With <b>--names</b>, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>commands both accept
              and display port and table names; with <b>--no-names</b>,
              commands neither accept nor display port and table names.

              If a port or table name contains special characters or
              might be confused with a keyword within a flow, it may be
              enclosed in double quotes (escaped from the shell).  If
              necessary, JSON-style escape sequences may be used inside
              quotes, as specified in RFC 7159.  When it displays port
              and table names, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>quotes any name that does not
              start with a letter followed by letters or digits.

              Open vSwitch added support for port names and these
              options.  Open vSwitch 2.10 added support for table names.
              Earlier versions always behaved as if <b>--no-names </b>were
              specified.

              Open vSwitch does not place its own limit on the length of
              port names, but OpenFlow limits port names to 15 bytes.
              Because ovs-ofctl uses OpenFlow to retrieve the mapping
              between port names and numbers, names longer than this
              limit will be truncated for both display and acceptance.
              Truncation can also cause long names that are different to
              appear to be the same; when a switch has two ports with
              the same (truncated) name, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>refuses to display or
              accept the name, using the number instead.

              OpenFlow and Open vSwitch limit table names to 32 bytes.

       <b>--stats</b>
       <b>--no-stats</b>
              The <b>dump-flows </b>command by default, or with <b>--stats</b>,
              includes flow duration, packet and byte counts, and idle
              and hard age in its output.  With <b>--no-stats</b>, it omits all
              of these, as well as cookie values and table IDs if they
              are zero.

       <b>--read-only</b>
              Do not execute read/write commands.

       <b>--bundle</b>
              Execute flow mods as an OpenFlow 1.4 atomic bundle
              transaction.

              â€¢      Within a bundle, all flow mods are processed in the
                     order they appear and as a single atomic
                     transaction, meaning that if one of them fails, the
                     whole transaction fails and none of the changes are
                     made to the <i>switch</i>'s flow table, and that each
                     given datapath packet traversing the OpenFlow
                     tables sees the flow tables either as before the
                     transaction, or after all the flow mods in the
                     bundle have been successfully applied.

              â€¢      The beginning and the end of the flow table
                     modification commands in a bundle are delimited
                     with OpenFlow 1.4 bundle control messages, which
                     makes it possible to stream the included commands
                     without explicit OpenFlow barriers, which are
                     otherwise used after each flow table modification
                     command.  This may make large modifications execute
                     faster as a bundle.

              â€¢      Bundles require OpenFlow 1.4 or higher.  An
                     explicit <b>-O OpenFlow14 </b>option is not needed, but
                     you may need to enable OpenFlow 1.4 support for OVS
                     by setting the OVSDB <i>protocols</i> column in the <i>bridge</i>
                     table.

       <b>-O </b>[<i>version</i>[<b>,</b><i>version</i>]...]
       <b>--protocols=</b>[<i>version</i>[<b>,</b><i>version</i>]...]
              Sets the OpenFlow protocol versions that are allowed when
              establishing an OpenFlow session.

              These protocol versions are enabled by default:

              â€¢      <b>OpenFlow10</b>, for OpenFlow 1.0.
       The following protocol versions are generally supported, but for
       compatibility with older versions of Open vSwitch they are not
       enabled by default:

              â€¢      <b>OpenFlow11</b>, for OpenFlow 1.1.

              â€¢      <b>OpenFlow12</b>, for OpenFlow 1.2.

              â€¢      <b>OpenFlow13</b>, for OpenFlow 1.3.

              â€¢      <b>OpenFlow14</b>, for OpenFlow 1.4.

              â€¢      <b>OpenFlow15</b>, for OpenFlow 1.5.

       <b>-F </b><i>format</i>[<b>,</b><i>format</i>...]
       <b>--flow-format=</b><i>format</i>[<b>,</b><i>format</i>...]
              <b>ovs-ofctl </b>supports the following individual flow formats,
              any number of which may be listed as <i>format</i>:

              <b>OpenFlow10-table_id</b>
                     This is the standard OpenFlow 1.0 flow format.  All
                     OpenFlow switches and all versions of Open vSwitch
                     support this flow format.

              <b>OpenFlow10+table_id</b>
                     This is the standard OpenFlow 1.0 flow format plus
                     a Nicira extension that allows <b>ovs-ofctl </b>to specify
                     the flow table in which a particular flow should be
                     placed.  Open vSwitch 1.2 and later supports this
                     flow format.

              <b>NXM-table_id </b>(Nicira Extended Match)
                     This Nicira extension to OpenFlow is flexible and
                     extensible.  It supports all of the Nicira flow
                     extensions, such as <b>tun_id </b>and registers.  Open
                     vSwitch 1.1 and later supports this flow format.

              <b>NXM+table_id </b>(Nicira Extended Match)
                     This combines Nicira Extended match with the
                     ability to place a flow in a specific table.  Open
                     vSwitch 1.2 and later supports this flow format.

              <b>OXM-OpenFlow12</b>
              <b>OXM-OpenFlow13</b>
              <b>OXM-OpenFlow14</b>
              <b>OXM-OpenFlow15</b>
                     These are the standard OXM (OpenFlow Extensible
                     Match) flow format in OpenFlow 1.2 and later.

              <b>ovs-ofctl </b>also supports the following abbreviations for
              collections of flow formats:

              <b>any    </b>Any supported flow format.

              <b>OpenFlow10</b>
                     <b>OpenFlow10-table_id </b>or <b>OpenFlow10+table_id</b>.

              <b>NXM    NXM-table_id </b>or <b>NXM+table_id</b>.

              <b>OXM    OXM-OpenFlow12</b>, <b>OXM-OpenFlow13</b>, or <b>OXM-OpenFlow14</b>.

              For commands that modify the flow table, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>by
              default negotiates the most widely supported flow format
              that supports the flows being added.  For commands that
              query the flow table, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>by default uses the most
              advanced format supported by the switch.

              This option, where <i>format</i> is a comma-separated list of one
              or more of the formats listed above, limits <b>ovs-ofctl</b>'s
              choice of flow format.  If a command cannot work as
              requested using one of the specified flow formats,
              <b>ovs-ofctl </b>will report a fatal error.

       <b>-P </b><i>format</i>
       <b>--packet-in-format=</b><i>format</i>
              <b>ovs-ofctl </b>supports the following ``packet-in'' formats, in
              order of increasing capability:

              <b>standard</b>
                     This uses the <b>OFPT_PACKET_IN </b>message, the standard
                     ``packet-in'' message for any given OpenFlow
                     version.  Every OpenFlow switch that supports a
                     given OpenFlow version supports this format.

              <b>nxt_packet_in</b>
                     This uses the <b>NXT_PACKET_IN </b>message, which adds
                     many of the capabilities of the OpenFlow 1.1 and
                     later ``packet-in'' messages before those OpenFlow
                     versions were available in Open vSwitch.  Open
                     vSwitch 1.1 and later support this format.  Only
                     Open vSwitch 2.6 and later, however, support it for
                     OpenFlow 1.1 and later (but there is little reason
                     to use it with those versions of OpenFlow).

              <b>nxt_packet_in2</b>
                     This uses the <b>NXT_PACKET_IN2 </b>message, which is
                     extensible and should avoid the need to define new
                     formats later.  In particular, this format supports
                     passing arbitrary user-provided data to a
                     controller using the <b>userdata option on the</b>
                     <b>controller </b>action.  Open vSwitch 2.6 and later
                     support this format.

              Without this option, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>prefers <b>nxt_packet_in2 </b>if
              the switch supports it.  Otherwise, if OpenFlow 1.0 is in
              use, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>prefers <b>nxt_packet_in </b>if the switch
              supports it.  Otherwise, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>falls back to the
              <b>standard </b>packet-in format.  When this option is specified,
              <b>ovs-ofctl </b>insists on the selected format.  If the switch
              does not support the requested format, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>will
              report a fatal error.

              Before version 2.6, Open vSwitch called <b>standard </b>format
              <b>openflow10 </b>and <b>nxt_packet_in </b>format <b>nxm</b>, and <b>ovs-ofctl</b>
              still accepts these names as synonyms.  (The name
              <b>openflow10 </b>was a misnomer because this format actually
              varies from one OpenFlow version to another; it is not
              consistently OpenFlow 1.0 format.  Similarly, when
              <b>nxt_packet_in2 </b>was introduced, the name <b>nxm </b>became
              confusing because it also uses OXM/NXM.)

              This option affects only the <b>monitor </b>command.

       <b>--timestamp</b>
              Print a timestamp before each received packet.  This
              option only affects the <b>monitor</b>, <b>snoop</b>, and <b>ofp-parse-pcap</b>
              commands.

       <b>-m</b>
       <b>--more </b>Increases the verbosity of OpenFlow messages printed and
              logged by <b>ovs-ofctl </b>commands.  Specify this option more
              than once to increase verbosity further.

       <b>--sort</b>[<b>=</b><i>field</i>]
       <b>--rsort</b>[<b>=</b><i>field</i>]
              Display output sorted by flow <i>field</i> in ascending (<b>--sort</b>)
              or descending (<b>--rsort</b>) order, where <i>field</i> is any of the
              fields that are allowed for matching or <b>priority </b>to sort
              by priority.  When <i>field</i> is omitted, the output is sorted
              by priority.  Specify these options multiple times to sort
              by multiple fields.

              Any given flow will not necessarily specify a value for a
              given field.  This requires special treatement:

              â€¢      A flow that does not specify any part of a field
                     that is used for sorting is sorted after all the
                     flows that do specify the field.  For example,
                     <b>--sort=tcp_src </b>will sort all the flows that specify
                     a TCP source port in ascending order, followed by
                     the flows that do not specify a TCP source port at
                     all.

              â€¢      A flow that only specifies some bits in a field is
                     sorted as if the wildcarded bits were zero.  For
                     example, <b>--sort=nw_src </b>would sort a flow that
                     specifies <b>nw_src=192.168.0.0/24 </b>the same as
                     <b>nw_src=192.168.0.0</b>.

              These options currently affect only <b>dump-flows </b>output.

   <b>Daemon Options</b>
       The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.

       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><i>pidfile</i>]
              Causes a file (by default, <b>ovs-ofctl.pid</b>) to be created
              indicating the PID of the running process.  If the <i>pidfile</i>
              argument is not specified, or if it does not begin with <b>/</b>,
              then it is created in <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.

              If <b>--pidfile </b>is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By default, when <b>--pidfile </b>is specified and the specified
              pidfile already exists and is locked by a running process,
              <b>ovs-ofctl </b>refuses to start.  Specify <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              to cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile </b>is not specified, this option has no
              effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs <b>ovs-ofctl </b>as a background process.  The process
              forks, and in the child it starts a new session, closes
              the standard file descriptors (which has the side effect
              of disabling logging to the console), and changes its
              current directory to the root (unless <b>--no-chdir </b>is
              specified).  After the child completes its initialization,
              the parent exits.  <b>ovs-ofctl </b>detaches only when executing
              the <b>monitor </b>or <b>snoop </b>commands.

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates an additional process to monitor the <b>ovs-ofctl</b>
              daemon.  If the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates
              a programming error (<b>SIGABRT</b>, <b>SIGALRM</b>, <b>SIGBUS</b>, <b>SIGFPE</b>,
              <b>SIGILL</b>, <b>SIGPIPE</b>, <b>SIGSEGV</b>, <b>SIGXCPU</b>, or <b>SIGXFSZ</b>) then the
              monitor process starts a new copy of it.  If the daemon
              dies or exits for another reason, the monitor process
              exits.

              This option is normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but it also
              functions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By default, when <b>--detach </b>is specified, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>changes
              its current working directory to the root directory after
              it detaches.  Otherwise, invoking <b>ovs-ofctl </b>from a
              carelessly chosen directory would prevent the
              administrator from unmounting the file system that holds
              that directory.

              Specifying <b>--no-chdir </b>suppresses this behavior, preventing
              <b>ovs-ofctl </b>from changing its current working directory.
              This may be useful for collecting core files, since it is
              common behavior to write core dumps into the current
              working directory and the root directory is not a good
              directory to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach </b>is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By default daemon will try to self-confine itself to work
              with files under well-known directories determined during
              build.  It is better to stick with this default behavior
              and not to use this flag unless some other Access Control
              is used to confine daemon.  Note that in contrast to other
              access control implementations that are typically enforced
              from kernel-space (e.g. DAC or MAC), self-confinement is
              imposed from the user-space daemon itself and hence should
              not be considered as a full confinement strategy, but
              instead should be viewed as an additional layer of
              security.

       <b>--user </b>Causes <b>ovs-ofctl </b>to run as a different user specified in
              "user:group", thus dropping most of the root privileges.
              Short forms "user" and ":group" are also allowed, with
              current user or group are assumed respectively. Only
              daemons started by the root user accepts this argument.

              On Linux, daemons will be granted CAP_IPC_LOCK and
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES before dropping root privileges.
              Daemons that interact with a datapath, such as
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, will be granted three additional
              capabilities, namely CAP_NET_ADMIN, CAP_NET_BROADCAST and
              CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability change will apply even if the
              new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For
              security reasons, specifying this option will cause the
              daemon process not to start.

       <b>--unixctl=</b><i>socket</i>
              Sets the name of the control socket on which <b>ovs-ofctl</b>
              listens for runtime management commands (see <b>RUNTIME</b>
              <b>MANAGEMENT COMMANDS</b>, below).  If <i>socket</i> does not begin
              with <b>/</b>, it is interpreted as relative to
              <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.  If <b>--unixctl </b>is not used
              at all, the default socket is
              <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-ofctl.</b><i>pid</i><b>.ctl</b>, where
              <i>pid</i> is <b>ovs-ofctl</b>'s process ID.

              On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for
              runtime management commands.  A file is created in the
              absolute path as pointed by <i>socket</i> or if <b>--unixctl </b>is not
              used at all, a file is created as <b>ovs-ofctl.ctl </b>in the
              configured <i>OVS_RUNDIR</i> directory.  The file exists just to
              mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.

              Specifying <b>none </b>for <i>socket</i> disables the control socket
              feature.

   <b>Public Key Infrastructure Options</b>
       <b>-p </b><i>privkey.pem</i>
       <b>--private-key=</b><i>privkey.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as
              <b>ovs-ofctl</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       <b>-c </b><i>cert.pem</i>
       <b>--certificate=</b><i>cert.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that
              certifies the private key specified on <b>-p </b>or <b>--private-key</b>
              to be trustworthy.  The certificate must be signed by the
              certificate authority (CA) that the peer in SSL
              connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C </b><i>cacert.pem</i>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><i>cacert.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that
              <b>ovs-ofctl </b>should use to verify certificates presented to
              it by SSL peers.  (This may be the same certificate that
              SSL peers use to verify the certificate specified on <b>-c </b>or
              <b>--certificate</b>, or it may be a different one, depending on
              the PKI design in use.)

       <b>-C none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL
              peers.  This introduces a security risk, because it means
              that certificates cannot be verified to be those of known
              trusted hosts.

       <b>-v</b>[<i>spec</i>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<i>spec</i>]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any <i>spec</i>, sets the log level
              for every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <i>spec</i>
              is a list of words separated by spaces or commas or
              colons, up to one from each category below:

              â€¢      A valid module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b>
                     command on <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a>, limits the log level
                     change to the specified module.

              â€¢      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level
                     change to only to the system log, to the console,
                     or to a file, respectively.  (If <b>--detach </b>is
                     specified, <b>ovs-ofctl </b>closes its standard file
                     descriptors, so logging to the console will have no
                     effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog </b>is accepted as a word
                     and is only useful along with the <b>--syslog-target</b>
                     option (the word has no effect otherwise).

              â€¢      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the
                     log level.  Messages of the given severity or
                     higher will be logged, and messages of lower
                     severity will be filtered out.  <b>off </b>filters out all
                     messages.  See <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a definition of
                     each log level.

              Case is not significant within <i>spec</i>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a
              file will not take place unless <b>--log-file </b>is also
              specified (see below).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any </b>is
              accepted as a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
              <b>--verbose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
              Sets the log pattern for <i>destination</i> to <i>pattern</i>.  Refer to
              <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a description of the valid syntax for
              <i>pattern</i>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><i>facility</i>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><i>facility</i>
              Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. <i>facility</i> can
              be one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>,
              <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>, <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>,
              <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>, <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6 </b>or <b>local7</b>.
              If this option is not specified, <b>daemon </b>is used as the
              default for the local system syslog and <b>local0 </b>is used
              while sending a message to the target provided via the
              <b>--syslog-target </b>option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
              Enables logging to a file.  If <i>file</i> is specified, then it
              is used as the exact name for the log file.  The default
              log file name used if <i>file</i> is omitted is
              <b>/usr/local/var/log/openvswitch/ovs-ofctl.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><i>host</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <i>port</i> on <i>host</i>, in addition to
              the system syslog.  The <i>host</i> must be a numerical IP
              address, not a hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><i>method</i>
              Specify <i>method</i> how syslog messages should be sent to
              syslog daemon.  Following forms are supported:

              â€¢      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog() </b>function.  Downside of
                     using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix
                     to every message before it is actually sent to the
                     syslog daemon over <b>/dev/log </b>UNIX domain socket.

              â€¢      <b>unix:</b><i>file</i>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is
                     possible to specify arbitrary message format with
                     this option.  However, <b>rsyslogd 8.9 </b>and older
                     versions use hard coded parser function anyway that
                     limits UNIX domain socket use.  If you want to use
                     arbitrary message format with older <b>rsyslogd</b>
                     versions, then use UDP socket to localhost IP
                     address instead.

              â€¢      <b>udp:</b><i>ip</i>:<i>port</i>, use UDP socket.  With this method it
                     is possible to use arbitrary message format also
                     with older <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages
                     over UDP socket extra precaution needs to be taken
                     into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to
                     be configured to listen on the specified UDP port,
                     accidental iptables rules could be interfering with
                     local syslog traffic and there are some security
                     considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do
                     not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              â€¢      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is taken from the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>
              environment variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

       <b>--color</b>[<b>=</b><i>when</i>]
              Colorize the output (for some commands); <i>when</i> can be
              <b>never</b>, <b>always</b>, or <b>auto </b>(the default).

              Only some commands support output coloring.  Color names
              and default colors may change in future releases.

              The environment variable <b>OVS_COLORS </b>can be used to specify
              user-defined colors and other attributes used to highlight
              various parts of the output. If set, its value is a colon-
              separated list of capabilities that defaults to
              <b>ac:01;31:dr=34:le=31:pm=36:pr=35:sp=33:vl=32</b>. Supported
              capabilities were initially designed for coloring flows
              from <b>ovs-ofctl dump-flows </b><i>switch</i> command, and they are as
              follows.

                     <b>ac=01;31</b>
                            SGR substring for <b>actions= </b>keyword in a
                            flow.  The default is a bold red text
                            foreground.

                     <b>dr=34  </b>SGR substring for <b>drop </b>keyword.  The default
                            is a dark blue text foreground.

                     <b>le=31  </b>SGR substring for <b>learn= </b>keyword in a flow.
                            The default is a red text foreground.

                     <b>pm=36  </b>SGR substring for flow match attribute
                            names.  The default is a cyan text
                            foreground.

                     <b>pr=35  </b>SGR substring for keywords in a flow that
                            are followed by arguments inside
                            parenthesis.  The default is a magenta text
                            foreground.

                     <b>sp=33  </b>SGR substring for some special keywords in a
                            flow, notably: <b>table=</b>, <b>priority=</b>, <b>load:</b>,
                            <b>output:</b>, <b>move:</b>, <b>group:</b>, <b>CONTROLLER:</b>,
                            <b>set_field:</b>, <b>resubmit:</b>, <b>exit</b>.  The default is
                            a yellow text foreground.

                     <b>vl=32  </b>SGR substring for a lone flow match
                            attribute with no field name.  The default
                            is a green text foreground.

              See the Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the
              documentation of the text terminal that is used for
              permitted values and their meaning as character
              attributes.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help </b>Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> can send commands to a running <b>ovs-ofctl </b>process.
       The supported commands are listed below.

       <b>exit   </b>Causes <b>ovs-ofctl </b>to gracefully terminate.  This command
              applies only when executing the <b>monitor </b>or <b>snoop </b>commands.

       <b>ofctl/set-output-file </b><i>file</i>
              Causes all subsequent output to go to <i>file</i> instead of
              stderr.  This command applies only when executing the
              <b>monitor </b>or <b>snoop </b>commands.

       <b>ofctl/send </b><i>ofmsg</i>...
              Sends each <i>ofmsg</i>, specified as a sequence of hex digits
              that express an OpenFlow message, on the OpenFlow
              connection.  This command is useful only when executing
              the <b>monitor </b>command.

       <b>ofctl/packet-out </b><i>packet-out</i>
              Sends an OpenFlow PACKET_OUT message specified in
              <b>Packet-Out Syntax</b>, on the OpenFlow connection.  See
              <b>Packet-Out Syntax </b>section for more information.  This
              command is useful only when executing the <b>monitor </b>command.

       <b>ofctl/barrier</b>
              Sends an OpenFlow barrier request on the OpenFlow
              connection and waits for a reply.  This command is useful
              only for the <b>monitor </b>command.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following examples assume that <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>has a bridge
       named <b>br0 </b>configured.

       <b>ovs-ofctl dump-tables br0</b>
              Prints out the switch's table stats.  (This is more
              interesting after some traffic has passed through.)

       <b>ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0</b>
              Prints the flow entries in the switch.

       <b>ovs-ofctl add-flow table=0 actions=learn(table=1,hard_timeout=10,</b>
       <b>NXM_OF_VLAN_TCI[0..11],output:NXM_OF_IN_PORT[]), resubmit(,1)</b>
              <b>ovs-ofctl add-flow  table=1 priority=0 actions=flood</b>
              Implements a level 2 MAC learning switch using the learn.

       <b>ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 'table=0,priority=0</b>
       <b>actions=load:3-&gt;NXM_NX_REG0[0..15],learn(table=0,priority=1,idle_timeout=10,NXM_OF_ETH_SRC[],NXM_OF_VLAN_TCI[0..11],output:NXM_NX_REG0[0..15]),output:2</b>
              In this use of a learn action, the first packet from each
              source MAC will be sent to port 2. Subsequent packets will
              be output to port 3, with an idle timeout of 10 seconds.
              NXM field names and match field names are both accepted,
              e.g. <b>NXM_NX_REG0 </b>or <b>reg0 </b>for the first register, and empty
              brackets may be omitted.

              Additional examples may be found documented as part of
              related sections.
