NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ifconfig - configure a network interface
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ifconfig [-v] [-a] [-s] [interface]</b>
       <b>ifconfig [-v] interface [aftype] options | address ...</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Ifconfig </b>is used to configure the kernel-resident network
       interfaces.  It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as
       necessary.  After that, it is usually only needed when debugging
       or when system tuning is needed.

       If no arguments are given, <b>ifconfig </b>displays the status of the
       currently active interfaces.  If a single <b>interface </b>argument is
       given, it displays the status of the given interface only; if a
       single <b>-a </b>argument is given, it displays the status of all
       interfaces, even those that are down.  Otherwise, it configures
       an interface.
</pre> <h2>
Address Families </h2>
<pre>
       If the first argument after the interface name is recognized as
       the name of a supported address family, that address family is
       used for decoding and displaying all protocol addresses.
       Currently supported address families include <b>inet </b>(TCP/IP,
       default), <b>inet6 </b>(IPv6), <b>ax25 </b>(AMPR Packet Radio), <b>ddp </b>(Appletalk
       Phase 2), <b>ipx </b>(Novell IPX) and <b>netrom </b>(AMPR Packet radio).  All
       numbers supplied as parts in IPv4 dotted decimal notation may be
       decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, as specified in the ISO C
       standard (that is, a leading 0x or 0X implies hexadecimal;
       otherwise, a leading '0' implies octal; otherwise, the number is
       interpreted as decimal). Use of hexadecimal and octal numbers is
       not RFC-compliant and therefore its use is discouraged.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a     </b>display all interfaces which are currently available, even
              if down

       <b>-s     </b>display a short list (like netstat -i)

       <b>-v     </b>be more verbose for some error conditions

       <b>interface</b>
              The name of the interface.  This is usually a driver name
              followed by a unit number, for example <b>eth0 </b>for the first
              Ethernet interface. If your kernel supports alias
              interfaces, you can specify them with syntax like <b>eth0:0</b>
              for the first alias of eth0. You can use them to assign
              more addresses. To delete an alias interface use <b>ifconfig</b>
              <b>eth0:0 down</b>.  Note: for every scope (i.e. same net with
              address/netmask combination) all aliases are deleted, if
              you delete the first (primary).

       <b>up     </b>This flag causes the interface to be activated.  It is
              implicitly specified if an address is assigned to the
              interface; you can suppress this behavior when using an
              alias interface by appending an <b>- </b>to the alias (e.g.
              <b>eth0:0-</b>).  It is also suppressed when using the IPv4
              0.0.0.0 address as the kernel will use this to implicitly
              delete alias interfaces.

       <b>down   </b>This flag causes the driver for this interface to be shut
              down.

       <b>[-]arp </b>Enable or disable the use of the ARP protocol on this
              interface.

       <b>[-]promisc</b>
              Enable or disable the <b>promiscuous </b>mode of the interface.
              If selected, all packets on the network will be received
              by the interface.

       <b>[-]allmulti</b>
              Enable or disable <b>all-multicast </b>mode.  If selected, all
              multicast packets on the network will be received by the
              interface.

       <b>mtu N  </b>This parameter sets the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of an
              interface.

       <b>dstaddr addr</b>
              Set the remote IP address for a point-to-point link (such
              as PPP).  This keyword is now obsolete; use the
              <b>pointopoint </b>keyword instead.

       <b>netmask addr</b>
              Set the IP network mask for this interface.  This value
              defaults to the usual class A, B or C network mask (as
              derived from the interface IP address), but it can be set
              to any value.

       <b>add addr/prefixlen</b>
              Add an IPv6 address to an interface.

       <b>del addr/prefixlen</b>
              Remove an IPv6 address from an interface.

       <b>tunnel ::aa.bb.cc.dd</b>
              Create a new SIT (IPv6-in-IPv4) device, tunnelling to the
              given destination.

       <b>irq addr</b>
              Set the interrupt line used by this device.  Not all
              devices can dynamically change their IRQ setting.

       <b>io_addr addr</b>
              Set the start address in I/O space for this device.

       <b>mem_start addr</b>
              Set the start address for shared memory used by this
              device.  Only a few devices need this.

       <b>media type</b>
              Set the physical port or medium type to be used by the
              device.  Not all devices can change this setting, and
              those that can vary in what values they support.  Typical
              values for <b>type </b>are <b>10base2 </b>(thin Ethernet), <b>10baseT</b>
              (twisted-pair 10Mbps Ethernet), <b>AUI </b>(external transceiver)
              and so on.  The special medium type of <b>auto </b>can be used to
              tell the driver to auto-sense the media.  Again, not all
              drivers can do this.

       <b>[-]broadcast [addr]</b>
              If the address argument is given, set the protocol
              broadcast address for this interface.  Otherwise, set (or
              clear) the <b>IFF_BROADCAST </b>flag for the interface.

       <b>[-]pointopoint [addr]</b>
              This keyword enables the <b>point-to-point </b>mode of an
              interface, meaning that it is a direct link between two
              machines with nobody else listening on it.
              If the address argument is also given, set the protocol
              address of the other side of the link, just like the
              obsolete <b>dstaddr </b>keyword does.  Otherwise, set or clear
              the <b>IFF_POINTOPOINT </b>flag for the interface.

       <b>hw class address</b>
              Set the hardware address of this interface, if the device
              driver supports this operation.  The keyword must be
              followed by the name of the hardware class and the
              printable ASCII equivalent of the hardware address.
              Hardware classes currently supported include <b>ether</b>
              (Ethernet), <b>ax25 </b>(AMPR AX.25), <b>ARCnet </b>and <b>netrom </b>(AMPR
              NET/ROM).

       <b>multicast</b>
              Set the multicast flag on the interface. This should not
              normally be needed as the drivers set the flag correctly
              themselves.

       <b>address</b>
              The IP address to be assigned to this interface.

       <b>txqueuelen length</b>
              Set the length of the transmit queue of the device. It is
              useful to set this to small values for slower devices with
              a high latency (modem links, ISDN) to prevent fast bulk
              transfers from disturbing interactive traffic like telnet
              too much.

       <b>name </b><i>newname</i>
              Change the name of this interface to <i>newname</i>. The
              interface must be shut down first.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Since kernel release 2.2 there are no explicit interface
       statistics for alias interfaces anymore. The statistics printed
       for the original address are shared with all alias addresses on
       the same device. If you want per-address statistics you should
       add explicit accounting rules for the address using the
       <a href="iptables.8.html">iptables(8)</a> command.

       Since net-tools 1.60-4 ifconfig is printing byte counters and
       human readable counters with IEC 60027-2 units. So 1 KiB are 2^10
       byte. Note, the numbers are truncated to one decimal (which can
       by quite a large error if you consider 0.1 PiB is
       112.589.990.684.262 bytes :)

       Interrupt problems with Ethernet device drivers fail with EAGAIN
       <i>(SIOCSIIFLAGS: Resource temporarily unavailable)</i> it is most
       likely a interrupt conflict. See
       <i><a href="http://www.scyld.com/expert/irq-conflict.html">http://www.scyld.com/expert/irq-conflict.html</a> </i> for more
       information.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Ifconfig uses the ioctl access method to get the full address
       information, which limits hardware addresses to 8 bytes.  Because
       Infiniband hardware address has 20 bytes, only the first 8 bytes
       are displayed correctly.  Please use <b>ip link </b>command from
       <b>iproute2 </b>package to display link layer informations including the
       hardware address.

       While appletalk DDP and IPX addresses will be displayed they
       cannot be altered by this command.
