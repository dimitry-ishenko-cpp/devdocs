NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cups-lpd - receive print jobs and report printer status to lpd
       clients (deprecated)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cups-lpd </b>[ <b>-h </b><i>hostname</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>] ] [ <b>-n </b>] [ <b>-o </b><i>option=value</i> ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cups-lpd </b>is the CUPS Line Printer Daemon ("LPD") mini-server that
       supports legacy client systems that use the LPD protocol.  <b>cups-</b>
       <b>lpd </b>does not act as a standalone network daemon but instead
       operates using any of the Internet "super-servers" such as
       <b>inetd</b>(8), <b>launchd</b>(8), and <b>systemd</b>(8).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-h </b><i>hostname</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
            Sets the CUPS server (and port) to use.

       <b>-n   </b>Disables reverse address lookups; normally <b>cups-lpd </b>will try
            to discover the hostname of the client via a reverse DNS
            lookup.

       <b>-o </b><i>name=value</i>
            Inserts options for all print queues. Most often this is
            used to disable the "l" filter so that remote print jobs are
            filtered as needed for printing; the <b>inetd</b>(8) example below
            sets the "document-format" option to "application/octet-
            stream" which forces autodetection of the print file format.
</pre> <h2>
CONFORMING TO </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cups-lpd </b>does not enforce the restricted source port number
       specified in RFC 1179, as using restricted ports does not prevent
       users from submitting print jobs.  While this behavior is
       different than standard Berkeley LPD implementations, it should
       not affect normal client operations.

       The output of the status requests follows RFC 2569, Mapping
       between LPD and IPP Protocols. Since many LPD implementations
       stray from this definition, remote status reporting to LPD
       clients may be unreliable.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Errors are sent to the system log.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i>
       <i>/etc/xinetd.d/cups-lpd</i>
       <i>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cups.cups-lpd.plist</i>
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>cups-lpd </b>program is deprecated and will no longer be
       supported in a future feature release of CUPS.

   <b>PERFORMANCE</b>
       <b>cups-lpd </b>performs well with small numbers of clients and
       printers.  However, since a new process is created for each
       connection and since each process must query the printing system
       before each job submission, it does not scale to larger
       configurations.  We highly recommend that large configurations
       use the native IPP support provided by CUPS instead.

   <b>SECURITY</b>
       <b>cups-lpd </b>currently does not perform any access control based on
       the settings in <a href="../man5/cupsd.conf.5.html">cupsd.conf(5)</a> or in the <b>hosts.allow</b>(5) or
       <b>hosts.deny</b>(5) files used by TCP wrappers.  Therefore, running
       <b>cups-lpd </b>on your server will allow any computer on your network
       (and perhaps the entire Internet) to print to your server.

       While <b>xinetd</b>(8) has built-in access control support, you should
       use the TCP wrappers package with <b>inetd</b>(8) to limit access to
       only those computers that should be able to print through your
       server.

       <b>cups-lpd </b>is not enabled by the standard CUPS distribution.
       Please consult with your operating system vendor to determine
       whether it is enabled by default on your system.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       If you are using <b>inetd</b>(8), add the following line to the
       <i>inetd.conf</i> file to enable the <b>cups-lpd </b>mini-server:

           printer stream tcp nowait lp /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd cups-lpd \
               -o document-format=application/octet-stream

       <i>Note:</i> If you are using Solaris 10 or higher, you must run the
       <b>inetdconv</b>(1m) program to register the changes to the <i>inetd.conf</i>
       file.

       CUPS includes configuration files for <b>launchd</b>(8), <b>systemd</b>(8), and
       <b>xinetd</b>(8).  Simply enable the <b>cups-lpd </b>service using the
       corresponding control program.
