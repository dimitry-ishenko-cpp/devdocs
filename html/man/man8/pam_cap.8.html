NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pam_cap </b>- Capabilities PAM module
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       [service-name] <b>auth </b>control-flag <b>pam_cap </b>[options]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pam_so </b>module can be used to specify <i>Inheritable</i> capabilities
       to process trees rooted in the PAM application. The module also
       supports blocking <i>Bounding</i> vector capabilities and adding <i>Ambient</i>
       vector capabilities.

       For general PAM apps to work correctly, the application must be
       run with at least <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>raised in its <i>Permitted</i> capability
       flag. Many PAM applications run as <i>root</i>, which has all of the
       bits in the <i>Bounding</i> set raised, so this requirement is typically
       met. To grant an <i>Ambient</i> vector capability, the corresponding
       Permitted bit must be available to the application too.

       The <b>pam_so </b>module is a Linux-PAM <i>auth</i> module. It provides
       functionality to back <b>pam_sm_authenticate() </b>and <b>pam_sm_setcred()</b>.
       It is the latter that actually modifies the inheritable 3-tuple
       of capability vectors: the configured <i>IAB</i>. In a typical
       application configuration you might have a line like this:

           auth    optional    pam_cap.so

       The module arguments are:

       ○   <b>debug</b>: While supported, this is a no-op at present.

       ○   <b>config=</b><i>/path/to/file</i>: Override the default config for the
           module. The unspecified default value for this file is
           <b>/etc/security/capability.conf</b>. Note, <b>config=/dev/null </b>is a
           valid value. See <b>default= </b>below for situations in which this
           might be appropriate.

       ○   <b>keepcaps</b>: This is as much as the <b>pam_cap.so </b>module can do to
           help an application support use of the <i>Ambient</i> capability
           vector. The application support for the <i>Ambient</i> set is poor
           at the present time.

       ○   <b>autoauth</b>: This argument causes the <b>pam_cap.so </b>module to
           return <b>PAM_SUCCESS </b>if the <b>PAM_USER </b>being authenticated
           exists. The absence of this argument will cause <b>pam_cap.so </b>to
           only return <b>PAM_SUCCESS </b>if the <b>PAM_USER </b>is covered by a
           specific rule in the prevailing config file.

       ○   <b>default=</b><i>IAB</i>: This argument is ignored if the prevailing
           configuration file contains a "<b>*</b>" rule. If there is no such
           rule, the <i>IAB</i> 3-tuple is inserted at the end of the config
           file and applies to all <b>PAM_USER</b>s not covered by an earlier
           rule. Note, if you want all <b>PAM_USER</b>s to be covered by this
           default rule, you can supply the module argument
           <b>config=/dev/null</b>.

       ○   <b>defer</b>: This argument arranges for the <i>IAB</i> capabilities
           granted to a user to be added sufficiently late in the
           Linux-PAM authentication stack that they stick. That is,
           <i>after</i> the application does its <b>setuid(UID) </b>call. As such, in
           conjunction with the <b>keepcaps </b>module argument, such compliant
           applications can support granting <i>Ambient</i> vector capabilities
           with <b>pam_cap.so</b>.
