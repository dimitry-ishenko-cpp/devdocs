NAME </h2>
<pre>
       quotacheck - scan a filesystem for disk usage, create, check and
       repair quota files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>quotacheck </b>[ <b>-gubcfinvdMmR </b>] [ <b>-F </b><i>quota-format</i> ] <b>-a </b>| <i>filesystem</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>quotacheck </b>examines each filesystem, builds a table of current
       disk usage, and compares this table against that recorded in the
       disk quota file for the filesystem (this step is omitted if
       option <b>-c </b>is specified). If any inconsistencies are detected,
       both the quota file and the current system copy of the incorrect
       quotas are updated (the latter only occurs if an active
       filesystem is checked which is not advised).  By default, only
       user quotas are checked.  <b>quotacheck </b>expects each filesystem to
       be checked to have quota files named <i>[a]quota.user</i> and
       <i>[a]quota.group</i> located at the root of the associated filesystem.
       If a file is not present, <b>quotacheck </b>will create it.

       If the quota file is corrupted, <b>quotacheck </b>tries to save as much
       data as possible.  Rescuing data may need user intervention. With
       no additional options <b>quotacheck </b>will simply exit in such a
       situation. When in interactive mode (option <b>-i</b>) , the user is
       asked for advice. Advice can also be provided from command line
       (see option <b>-n</b>) , which is useful when <b>quotacheck </b>is run
       automatically (ie. from script) and failure is unacceptable.

       <b>quotacheck </b>should be run each time the system boots and mounts
       non-valid filesystems.  This is most likely to happen after a
       system crash.

       It is strongly recommended to run <b>quotacheck </b>with quotas turned
       off for the filesystem. Otherwise, possible damage or loss to
       data in the quota files can result.  It is also unwise to run
       <b>quotacheck </b>on a live filesystem as actual usage may change during
       the scan.  To prevent this, <b>quotacheck </b>tries to remount the
       filesystem read-only before starting the scan.  After the scan is
       done it remounts the filesystem read-write. You can disable this
       with option <b>-m</b>.  You can also make <b>quotacheck </b>ignore the failure
       to remount the filesystem read-only with option <b>-M</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-b, --backup</b>
              Forces <b>quotacheck </b>to make backups of the quota file before
              writing the new data.

       <b>-v, --verbose</b>
              <b>quotacheck </b>reports its operation as it progresses.
              Normally it operates silently.  If the option is specified
              twice, also the current directory is printed (note that
              printing can slow down the scan measurably).

       <b>-d, --debug</b>
              Enable debugging mode.  It will result in a lot of
              information which can be used in debugging the program.
              The output is very verbose and the scan will be slow.

       <b>-u, --user</b>
              Only user quotas listed in <i>/etc/mtab</i> or on the filesystems
              specified are to be checked.  This is the default action.

       <b>-g, --group</b>
              Only group quotas listed in <i>/etc/mtab</i> or on the
              filesystems specified are to be checked.

       <b>-c, --create-files</b>
              Don't read existing quota files. Just perform a new scan
              and save it to disk.  <b>quotacheck </b>also skips scanning of
              old quota files when they are not found.

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              Forces checking and writing of new quota files on
              filesystems with quotas enabled. This is not recommended
              as the created quota files may be out of sync.

       <b>-M, --try-remount</b>
              This flag forces checking of filesystem in read-write mode
              if a remount fails. Do this only when you are sure no
              process will write to a filesystem while scanning.

       <b>-m, --no-remount</b>
              Don't try to remount filesystem read-only. See comment
              with option <b>-M</b>.

       <b>-i, --interactive</b>
              Interactive mode. By default <b>quotacheck </b>exits when it
              finds an error. In interactive mode user is asked for
              input instead.  See option <b>-n</b>.

       <b>-n, --use-first-dquot</b>
              If the quota files become corrupted, it is possible for
              duplicate entries for a single user or group ID to exist.
              Normally in this case, <b>quotacheck </b>exits or asks user for
              input. When this option is set, the first entry found is
              always used (this option works in interactive mode too).

       <b>-F, --format=</b><i>format-name</i>
              Check and fix quota files of specified format (ie. don't
              perform format auto-detection). This is recommended as
              detection might not work well on corrupted quota files.
              Possible format names are: <b>vfsold </b>Original quota format
              with 16-bit UIDs / GIDs, <b>vfsv0 </b>Quota format with 32-bit
              UIDs / GIDs, 64-bit space usage, 32-bit inode usage and
              limits, <b>vfsv1 </b>Quota format with 64-bit quota limits and
              usage, <b>rpc </b>(quota over NFS), <b>xfs </b>(quota on XFS filesystem)

       <b>-a, --all</b>
              Check all mounted non-NFS filesystems in <b>/etc/mtab</b>

       <b>-R, --exclude-root</b>
              When used together with the <b>-a </b>option, all filesystems
              except for the root filesystem are checked for quotas.
</pre> <h2>
NOTE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>quotacheck </b>should only be run by super-user. Non-privileged users
       are presumably not allowed to read all the directories on the
       given filesystem.
