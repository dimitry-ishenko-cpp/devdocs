NAME </h2>
<pre>
       yum - Yellowdog Updater Modified shell
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>yum shell </b>[filename]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>yum </b>includes an interactive shell for conducting multiple
       commands or sets of commands during a single execution of yum.
       These commands can be issued manually or passed to yum from a
       file. The commands are much the same as the normal yum command
       line options. See here <a href="yum.8.html">yum(8)</a> for that information. There are a
       few additional commands documented below.

       <b>config</b>
                 [argument] [value]
                 args: debuglevel, errorlevel, obsoletes, gpgcheck,
              assumeyes, exclude
                   If no value is given it prints the current value.
                   If value is given it sets that value.

       <b>repo</b>
                 [argument] [option]
                   list: lists repositories and their status
                   enable: enable repositories. option = repository id
                   disable: disable repositories. option = repository id

       <b>transaction</b>
                 [argument]
                   list: lists the contents of the transaction
                   reset: reset (zero-out) the transaction
                   solve: run the dependency solver on the transaction
                   run: run the transaction

       <b>exit</b>
                   Causes the shell to exit, setting the exit status as
              specified by the
                   <b>shell_exit_status </b>option in <a href="../man5/yum.conf.5.html">yum.conf(5)</a>.
                   This command is also triggered when EOF is read
              (usually the C-d keystroke
                   or end of script).
</pre> <h2>
Examples </h2>
<pre>
       The following are examples of using the yum shell.

               list available packagename*
               groupinfo 'Some Group'
               install foo
               remove bar
               update baz
               run

              That will list available packages matching the glob
              'packagename*'.  It will return information on the group
              'Some Group' It will then queue the following commands
              into  the transaction: install foo, remove bar, update
              baz. Then the 'run' command will resolve dependencies for
              the transaction commands and run the transaction.
