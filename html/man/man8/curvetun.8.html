NAME </h2>
<pre>
       curvetun - a lightweight curve25519 ip4/6 tunnel
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>curvetun </b>[<i>options</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       curvetun is a lightweight, high-speed ECDH multiuser IP tunnel
       for Linux that is based on <b>epoll</b>(2).  curvetun uses the Linux
       TUN/TAP interface and supports {IPv4, IPv6} over {IPv4, IPv6}
       with UDP or TCP as carrier protocols.

       It has an integrated packet forwarding tree, thus multiple users
       with different IPs can be handled via a single tunnel device on
       the server side, and flows are scheduled for processing in a CPU
       efficient way, at least in the case of TCP as the carrier
       protocol.

       For key management, public-key cryptography based on elliptic
       curves are used and packets are encrypted end-to-end by the
       symmetric stream cipher Salsa20 and authenticated by the MAC
       Poly1305, where keys have previously been computed with the ECDH
       key agreement protocol Curve25519.

       Cryptography is based on Daniel J. Bernstein's networking and
       cryptography library “NaCl”. By design, curvetun does not provide
       any particular pattern or default port numbers that gives
       certainty that the connection from a particular flow is actually
       running curvetun.

       However, if you have a further need to bypass censorship, you can
       try using curvetun in combination with Tor's obfsproxy or Telex.
       Furthermore, curvetun also protects you against replay attacks
       and DH man-in-the-middle attacks.  Additionally, server-side
       syslog event logging can also be disabled to avoid revealing
       critical user connection data.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d &lt;tundev&gt;, --dev &lt;tundev&gt;</b>
              Defines the name of the tunnel device that is being
              created. If this option is not set, then the default
              names, curves{0,1,2,..} for a curvetun server, and
              curvec{0,1,2,...} for a curvetun client are used.

       <b>-p &lt;num&gt;, --port &lt;num&gt;</b>
              Defines the port the curvetun server should listen on.
              There is no default port for curvetun, so setting this
              option for server bootstrap is mandatory. This option is
              for servers only.

       <b>-t &lt;server&gt;, --stun &lt;server&gt;</b>
              If needed, this options enables an STUN lookup in order to
              show public IP to port mapping and to punch a hole into
              the firewall. In case you are unsure what STUN server to
              use, simply use ''--stun stunserver.org''.

       <b>-c[=alias], --client[=alias]</b>
              Starts curvetun in client mode and connects to the given
              connection alias that is defined in the configuration
              file.

       <b>-k, --keygen</b>
              Generate private and public keypair. This must be done
              initially.

       <b>-x, --export</b>
              Export user and key combination to stdout as a one-liner.

       <b>-C, --dumpc</b>
              Dump all known clients that may connect to the local
              curvetun server and exit.

       <b>-S, --dumps</b>
              Dump all known servers curvetun as a client can connect
              to, and exit.

       <b>-D, --nofork</b>
              Do not fork off as a client or server on startup.

       <b>-s, --server</b>
              Start curvetun in server mode. Additional parameters are
              needed, at least the definition of the port that clients
              can connect to is required.

       <b>-N, --no-logging</b>
              Disable all curvetun logging of user information. This
              option can be used to enable curvetun users to connect
              more anonymously. This option is for servers only.

       <b>-u, --udp</b>
              Use UDP as a carrier protocol instead of TCP. By default,
              TCP is the carrier protocol. This option is for servers
              only.

       <b>-4, --ipv4</b>
              Defines IPv4 as the underlying network protocol to be used
              on the tunnel device. IPv4 is the default. This option is
              for servers only.

       <b>-6, --ipv6</b>
              Defines IPv6 as the underlying network protocol to be used
              on the tunnel device. This option is for servers only.

       <b>-v, --version</b>
              Show version information and exit.

       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Show user help and exit.
</pre> <h2>
USAGE EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>curvetun --server -4 -u -N --port 6666 --stun stunserver.org</b>
              Starts curvetun in server mode with IPv4 as network
              protocol and UDP as a transport carrier protocol. The
              curvetun server listens for incoming connections on port
              6666 and performs an STUN lookup on startup to
              stunserver.org.

       <b>curvetun --client=ethz</b>
              Starts curvetun in client mode and connects to the defined
              connection alias ''ethz'' that is defined in the curvetun
              ~/.curvetun/servers configuration file.

       <b>curvetun --keygen</b>
              Generates initial keypairs and stores them in the
              ~/.curvetun/ directory.

       <b>curvetun --export</b>
              Export user data to stdout for configuration of a curvetun
              server.

CRYPTOGRAPHY </h2>
<pre>
       Encrypted IP tunnels are often used to create virtual private
       networks (VPN), where parts of the network can only be reached
       via an insecure or untrusted medium such as the Internet. Only a
       few software utilities exist to create such tunnels, or, VPNs.
       Two popular representatives of such software are OpenVPN and
       VTUN.

       The latter also introduced the TUN/TAP interfaces into the Linux
       kernel. VTUN only has a rather basic encryption module, that does
       not fit today's cryptographic needs. By default, MD5 is used to
       create 128-Bit wide keys for the symmetric BlowFish cipher in ECB
       mode [1].

       Although OpenSSL is used in both VTUN and OpenVPN, OpenVPN is
       much more feature rich regarding ciphers and user authentication.
       Nevertheless, letting people choose ciphers or authentication
       methods is not necessarily a good thing: administrators could
       either prefer speed over security and therefore choose weak
       ciphers, so that the communication system will be as good as
       without any cipher; they could choose weak passwords for
       symmetric encryption or they could misconfigure the communication
       system by having too much choice of ciphers and too little
       experience for picking the right one.

       Next to the administration issues, there are also software
       development issues.  Cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL are a
       huge mess and too low-level and complex to fully understand or
       correctly apply, so that they form further ground for
       vulnerabilities of such software.

       In 2010, the cryptographers Tanja Lange and Daniel J. Bernstein
       have therefore created and published a cryptographic library for
       networking, which is named NaCl (pronounced ''salt''). NaCl
       addresses such problems as mentioned in OpenSSL and, in contrast
       to the rather generic use of OpenSSL, was created with a strong
       focus on public-key authenticated encryption based on elliptic
       curve cryptography, which is used in curvetun. Partially quoting
       Daniel J.  Bernstein:

       "RSA is somewhat older than elliptic-curve cryptography: RSA was
       introduced in 1977, while elliptic-curve cryptography was
       introduced in 1985. However, RSA has shown many more weaknesses
       than elliptic-curve cryptography. RSA's effective security level
       was dramatically reduced by the linear sieve in the late 1970s,
       by the quadratic sieve and ECM in the 1980s, and by the number-
       field sieve in the 1990s. For comparison, a few attacks have been
       developed against some rare elliptic curves having special
       algebraic structures, and the amount of computer power available
       to attackers has predictably increased, but typical elliptic
       curves require just as much computer power to break today as they
       required twenty years ago.

       IEEE P1363 standardized elliptic-curve cryptography in the late
       1990s, including a stringent list of security criteria for
       elliptic curves. NIST used the IEEE P1363 criteria to select
       fifteen specific elliptic curves at five different security
       levels. In 2005, NSA issued a new ''Suite B'' standard,
       recommending the NIST elliptic curves (at two specific security
       levels) for all public-key cryptography and withdrawing previous
       recommendations of RSA."

       curvetun uses a particular elliptic curve, Curve25519, introduced
       in the following paper: Daniel J. Bernstein, ''Curve25519: new
       Diffie-Hellman speed records,'' pages 207-228 in Proceedings of
       PKC 2006, edited by Moti Yung, Yevgeniy Dodis, Aggelos Kiayias,
       and Tal Malkin, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3958, Springer,
       2006, ISBN 3-540-33851-9.

       This elliptic curve follows all of the standard IEEE P1363
       security criteria.  It also follows new recommendations that
       achieve ''side-channel immunity'' and ''twist security'' while
       improving speed. What this means is that secure implementations
       of Curve25519 are considerably simpler and faster than secure
       implementations of, for example, NIST P-256; there are fewer
       opportunities for implementors to make mistakes that compromise
       security, and mistakes are more easily caught by reviewers.

       An attacker who spends a billion dollars on special-purpose chips
       to attack Curve25519, using the best attacks available today, has
       about 1 chance in 1000000000000000000000000000 of breaking
       Curve25519 after a year of computation.  One could achieve
       similar levels of security with 3000-bit RSA, but encryption and
       authentication with 3000-bit RSA are not nearly fast enough to
       handle tunnel traffic and would require much more space in
       network packets.

SETUP HOWTO </h2>
<pre>
       If you have not run curvetun before, you need to do an initial
       setup once.

       First, make sure that the servers and clients clocks are
       periodically synced, for example, by running an NTP daemon. This
       is necessary to protect against replay attacks. Also, make sure
       you have read and write access to /dev/net/tun. You should not
       run curvetun as root! Then, after you have assured this, the
       first step is to generate keys and config files. On both the
       client and server do:

       <b>curvetun -k</b>

       You are asked for a user name. You can use an email address or
       whatever suits you. Here, we assume you have entered 'mysrv1' on
       the server and 'myclient1' on the client side.

       Now, all necessary files have been created under ~/.curvetun.
       Files include “priv.key”, “pub.key”, “username”, “clients” and
       “servers”.

       “clients” and “servers” are empty at the beginning and need to be
       filled. The “clients” file is meant for the server, so that it
       knows what clients are allowed to connect. The “servers” file is
       for the client, where it can select curvetun servers to connect
       to. Both files are kept very simple, so that a single
       configuration line per client or server is sufficient.

       The client needs to export its public key data for the server

       <b>curvetun -x</b>

       where it prints a string in the following format:

         myclient1;11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11
         \_______/
       \_____________________________________________________________________________________________/
          username  32 byte public key for 'myclient1'

       This line is transferred to the server admin (yes, we assume a
       manual on-site key exchange scenario where, for example, the
       admin sets up server and clients), where the admin then adds this
       entry into his ''clients'' file like:

         server$ echo
       "myclient1;11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:" \
                      "11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11" &gt;&gt;
       ~/.curvetun/clients

       The server admin can check if the server has registered it
       properly as follows:

         server$ curvetun -C

       which prints all parsed clients from ''~/.curvetun/clients''.
       This process could easily be automated or scripted with, for
       example, Perl and LDAP.

       Now, the client ''myclient1'' is known to the server; that
       completes the server configuration. The next step is to tell the
       client where it needs to connect to the server.

       We assume in this example that the tunnel server has a public IP
       address, e.g. 1.2.3.4, runs on port 6666 and uses UDP as a
       carrier protocol. In case you are behind NAT, you can use
       curvetun's ''--stun'' option for starting the server, to obtain
       your mapping. However, in this example we continue with 1.2.3.4
       and 6666, UDP.

       First, the server needs to export its key to the client, as
       follows:

         server$ curvetun -x

       where it prints a string in the following format:

         mysrv1;22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22
         \____/
       \_____________________________________________________________________________________________/
        username  32 byte public key for 'mysrv1'
                  ^-- you need this public key

       Thus, you now have the server IP address, server port, server
       transport protocol and the server's public key at hand. On the
       client side it can be put all together in the config as follows:

         client$ echo
       "myfirstserver;1.2.3.4;6666;udp;22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:" \
                      "22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:"
       \
                      "22:22" &gt;&gt; ~/.curvetun/servers

       The client can check its config using:

         client$ curvetun -S

       Then we start the server with:

         server$ curvetun -s -p 6666 -u
         server# ifconfig curves0 up
         server# ifconfig curves0 10.0.0.1/24

       Then, we start the client with:

         client$ curvetun -c=myfirstserver
         client# ifconfig curvec0 up
         client# ifconfig curvec0 10.0.0.2/24

       Also, client-side information, errors, or warnings will appear in
       syslog! By now we should be able to ping the server:

         client$ ping 10.0.0.1

       That's it! Routing example:

       Server side's public IP on eth0 is, for example, 1.2.3.4:

         server$ ... start curvetun server ...
         server# ifconfig curves0 up
         server# ifconfig curves0 10.0.0.1/24
         server# echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
         server# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
         server# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o curves0 -m state --state
       RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
         server# iptables -A FORWARD -i curves0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT

       Client side's IP on eth0 is, for example, 5.6.7.8:

         client$ ... start curvetun client ...
         client# ... lookup your default gateway (e.g. via route, here:
       5.6.7.9) ...
         client# ifconfig curvec0 up
         client# ifconfig curvec0 10.0.0.2/24
         client# route add -net 1.2.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 5.6.7.9
       dev eth0
         client# route add default gw 10.0.0.1
         client# route del default gw 5.6.7.9

       That should be it, happy browsing and emailing via curvetun
       tunnels!
