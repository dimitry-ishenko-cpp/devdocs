<span class="headline"><i>LASTLOG</i>(8)             System Management Commands             <i>LASTLOG</i>(8)</span>
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lastlog - reports the most recent login of all users or of a
       given user
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>lastlog </b>[<i>options</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lastlog </b>formats and prints the contents of the last login log
       /var/log/lastlog file. The <i>login-name</i>, <i>port</i>, and <i>last login time</i>
       will be printed. The default (no flags) causes lastlog entries to
       be printed, sorted by their order in /etc/passwd.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The options which apply to the <b>lastlog </b>command are:

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--before </b><i>DAYS</i>
           Print only lastlog records older than <i>DAYS</i>.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--clear</b>
           Clear lastlog record of a user. This option can be used only
           together with <b>-u </b>(<b>--user</b>)).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help message and exit.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root </b><i>CHROOT_DIR</i>
           Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use the
           configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only
           absolute paths are supported.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--set</b>
           Set lastlog record of a user to the current time. This option
           can be used only together with <b>-u </b>(<b>--user</b>)).

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--time </b><i>DAYS</i>
           Print the lastlog records more recent than <i>DAYS</i>.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user </b><i>LOGIN</i>|<i>RANGE</i>
           Print the lastlog record of the specified user(s).

           The users can be specified by a login name, a numerical user
           ID, or a <i>RANGE</i> of users. This <i>RANGE</i> of users can be specified
           with a min and max values (<i>UID_MIN-UID_MAX</i>), a max value
           (<i>-UID_MAX</i>), or a min value (<i>UID_MIN-</i>).

       If the user has never logged in the message <i>** Never logged in**</i>
       will be displayed instead of the port and time.

       Only the entries for the current users of the system will be
       displayed. Other entries may exist for users that were deleted
       previously.
</pre> <h2>
NOTE </h2>
<pre>
       The lastlog file is a database which contains info on the last
       login of each user. You should not rotate it. It is a sparse
       file, so its size on the disk is usually much smaller than the
       one shown by "<b>ls -l</b>" (which can indicate a really big file if you
       have in passwd users with a high UID). You can display its real
       size with "<b>ls -s</b>".
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
       the behavior of this tool:

       <b>LASTLOG_UID_MAX </b>(number)
           Highest user ID number for which the lastlog entries should
           be updated. As higher user IDs are usually tracked by remote
           user identity and authentication services there is no need to
           create a huge sparse lastlog file for them.

           No <b>LASTLOG_UID_MAX </b>option present in the configuration means
           that there is no user ID limit for writing lastlog entries.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /var/log/lastlog
           Database times of previous user logins.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       Large gaps in UID numbers will cause the lastlog program to run
       longer with no output to the screen (i.e. if in lastlog database
       there is no entries for users with UID between 170 and 800
       lastlog will appear to hang as it processes entries with UIDs
       171-799).

       Having high UIDs can create problems when handling the
       /var/log/lastlog with external tools. Although the actual file is
       sparse and does not use too much space, certain applications are
       not designed to identify sparse files by default and may require
       a specific option to handle them.
