</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>rpcinfo </b>makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports what it
       finds.

       In the first synopsis, <b>rpcinfo </b>lists all the registered RPC
       services with <b>rpcbind </b>on <i>host</i>.  If <i>host</i> is not specified, the
       local host is the default.  If <b>-s </b>is used, the information is
       displayed in a concise format.

       In the second synopsis, <b>rpcinfo </b>lists all the RPC services
       registered with <b>rpcbind</b>, version 2.  Also note that the format of
       the information is different in the first and the second
       synopsis.  This is because the second synopsis is an older
       protocol used to collect the information displayed (version 2 of
       the <b>rpcbind </b>protocol).

       The third synopsis makes an RPC call to procedure 0 of <i>prognum</i>
       and <i>versnum</i> on the specified <i>host</i> and reports whether a response
       was received.  <i>transport</i> is the transport which has to be used
       for contacting the given service.  The remote address of the
       service is obtained by making a call to the remote <b>rpcbind</b>.

       The <i>prognum</i> argument is a number that represents an RPC program
       number.  If a <i>versnum</i> is specified, <b>rpcinfo </b>attempts to call that
       version of the specified <i>prognum</i>.  Otherwise, <b>rpcinfo </b>attempts to
       find all the registered version numbers for the specified <i>prognum</i>
       by calling version 0, which is presumed not to exist; if it does
       exist, <b>rpcinfo </b>attempts to obtain this information by calling an
       extremely high version number instead, and attempts to call each
       registered version.  Note: the version number is required for <b>-b</b>
       and <b>-d </b>options.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-T </b><i>transport</i>
               Specify the transport on which the service is required.
               If this option is not specified, <b>rpcinfo </b>uses the
               transport specified in the NETPATH environment variable,
               or if that is unset or null, the transport in the
               <i>netconfig</i>(5) database is used.  This is a generic option,
               and can be used in conjunction with other options as
               shown in the SYNOPSIS.

       <b>-a </b><i>serv_address</i>
               Use <i>serv_address</i> as the (universal) address for the
               service on <i>transport</i> to ping procedure 0 of the specified
               <i>prognum</i> and report whether a response was received.  The
               <b>-T </b>option is required with the <b>-a </b>option.

               If <i>versnum</i> is not specified, <b>rpcinfo </b>tries to ping all
               available version numbers for that program number.  This
               option avoids calls to remote <b>rpcbind </b>to find the address
               of the service.  The <i>serv_address</i> is specified in
               universal address format of the given transport.

       <b>-b      </b>Make an RPC broadcast to procedure 0 of the specified
               <i>prognum</i> and <i>versnum</i> and report all hosts that respond.
               If <i>transport</i> is specified, it broadcasts its request only
               on the specified transport.  If broadcasting is not
               supported by any transport, an error message is printed.
               Use of broadcasting should be limited because of the
               potential for adverse effect on other systems.

       <b>-d      </b>Delete registration for the RPC service of the specified
               <i>prognum</i> and <i>versnum</i>.  If <i>transport</i> is specified,
               unregister the service on only that transport, otherwise
               unregister the service on all the transports on which it
               was registered.  Only the owner of a service can delete a
               registration, except the super-user who can delete any
               service.

       <b>-l      </b>Display a list of entries with a given <i>prognum</i> and
               <i>versnum</i> on the specified <i>host</i>.  Entries are returned for
               all transports in the same protocol family as that used
               to contact the remote <b>rpcbind</b>.

       <b>-m      </b>Display a table of statistics of <b>rpcbind </b>operations on
               the given <i>host</i>.  The table shows statistics for each
               version of <b>rpcbind </b>(versions 2, 3 and 4), giving the
               number of times each procedure was requested and
               successfully serviced, the number and type of remote call
               requests that were made, and information about RPC
               address lookups that were handled. This is useful for
               monitoring RPC activities on <i>host</i>.

       <b>-n </b><i>portnum</i>
               Use <i>portnum</i> as the port number for the <b>-t </b>and <b>-u </b>options
               instead of the port number given by <b>rpcbind</b>.  Use of this
               option avoids a call to the remote <b>rpcbind </b>to find out
               the address of the service. This option is made obsolete
               by the <b>-a </b>option.

       <b>-p      </b>Probe <b>rpcbind </b>on <i>host</i> using version 2 of the <b>rpcbind</b>
               protocol, and display a list of all registered RPC
               programs.  If <i>host</i> is not specified, it defaults to the
               local host.  Note: Version 2 of the <b>rpcbind </b>protocol was
               previously known as the portmapper protocol.

       <b>-s      </b>Display a concise list of all registered RPC programs on
               <i>host</i>.  If <i>host</i> is not specified, it defaults to the local
               host.

       <b>-t      </b>Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of <i>prognum</i> on the
               specified <i>host</i> using TCP, and report whether a response
               was received. This option is made obsolete by the <b>-T</b>
               option as shown in the third synopsis.

       <b>-u      </b>Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of <i>prognum</i> on the
               specified <i>host</i> using UDP, and report whether a response
               was received. This option is made obsolete by the <b>-T</b>
               option as shown in the third synopsis.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To show all of the RPC services registered on the local machine
       use:

               example% rpcinfo

       To show all of the RPC services registered with <b>rpcbind </b>on the
       machine named <b>klaxon </b>use:

               example% rpcinfo klaxon

       The information displayed by the above commands can be quite
       lengthy.  Use the <b>-s </b>option to display a more concise list:

               example$ rpcinfo -s klaxon

       program   version(s)                          netid(s)   service      owner
       100000    2,3,4     local,tcp,udp,tcp6,udp6   rpcbind    super-user
       100008    1         udp,tcp,udp6,tcp6         walld      super-user
       100002    2,1       udp,udp6                  rusersd    super-user
       100001    2,3,4     udp,udp6                  rstatd     super-user
       100012    1         udp,tcp                   sprayd     super-user
       100007    3         udp,tcp                   ypbind     super-user

       To show whether the RPC service with program number <i>prognum</i> and
       version <i>versnum</i> is registered on the machine named <b>klaxon </b>for the
       transport TCP use:

               example% rpcinfo -T tcp klaxon prognum versnum

       To show all RPC services registered with version 2 of the <b>rpcbind</b>
       protocol on the local machine use:

               example% rpcinfo -p

       To delete the registration for version 1 of the <b>walld </b>(program
       number 100008 ) service for all transports use:

               example# rpcinfo -d 100008 1

       or

               example# rpcinfo -d walld 1
