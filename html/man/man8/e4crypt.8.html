NAME </h2>
<pre>
       e4crypt - ext4 file system encryption utility
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>e4crypt add_key -S </b>[ <b>-k </b><i>keyring</i> ] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-q</b>] [ <b>-p </b><i>pad</i> ] [ <i>path</i> ...
       ]
       <b>e4crypt new_session</b>

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>e4crypt </b>performs encryption management for ext4 file systems.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>e4crypt add_key </b>[<b>-vq</b>] [<b>-S </b><i>salt</i> ] [<b>-k </b><i>keyring</i> ] [ <b>-p </b><i>pad</i> ] [ <i>path</i>
       ... ]
              Prompts the user for a passphrase and inserts it into the
              specified keyring.  If no keyring is specified, e4crypt
              will use the session keyring if it exists or the user
              session keyring if it does not.

              The <i>salt</i> argument is interpreted in a number of different
              ways, depending on how its prefix value.  If the first two
              characters are "s:", then the rest of the argument will be
              used as an text string and used as the salt value.  If the
              first two characters are "0x", then the rest of the
              argument will be parsed as a hex string as used as the
              salt.  If the first characters are "f:" then the rest of
              the argument will be interpreted as a filename from which
              the salt value will be read.  If the string begins with a
              '/' character, it will similarly be treated as filename.
              Finally, if the <i>salt</i> argument can be parsed as a valid
              UUID, then the UUID value will be used as a salt value.

              The <i>keyring</i> argument specifies the keyring to which the
              key should be added.

              The <i>pad</i> value specifies the number of bytes of padding
              will be added to directory names for obfuscation purposes.
              Valid <i>pad</i> values are 4, 8, 16, and 32.

              If one or more directory paths are specified, e4crypt will
              try to set the policy of those directories to use the key
              just added by the <b>add_key </b>command.  If a salt was
              explicitly specified, then it will be used to derive the
              encryption key of those directories.  Otherwise a
              directory-specific default salt will be used.

       <b>e4crypt get_policy </b><i>path</i> ...
              Print the policy for the directories specified on the
              command line.

       <b>e4crypt new_session</b>
              Give the invoking process (typically a shell) a new
              session keyring, discarding its old session keyring.

       <b>e4crypt set_policy </b>[ <b>-p </b><i>pad</i> ] <i>policy path</i> ...
              Sets the policy for the directories specified on the
              command line.  All directories must be empty to set the
              policy; if the directory already has a policy established,
              e4crypt will validate that the policy matches what was
              specified.  A policy is an encryption key identifier
              consisting of 16 hexadecimal characters.
