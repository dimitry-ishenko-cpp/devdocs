</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       setkeycodes - load kernel scancode-to-keycode mapping table
       entries
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>setkeycodes </b><i>scancode keycode ...</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>setkeycodes</i> command reads its arguments two at a time, each
       pair of arguments consisting of a scancode (given in hexadecimal)
       and a keycode (given in decimal). For each such pair, it tells
       the kernel keyboard driver to map the specified scancode to the
       specified keycode.

       This command is useful only for people with slightly unusual
       keyboards, that have a few keys which produce scancodes that the
       kernel does not recognize.
</pre> <h2>
THEORY </h2>
<pre>
       The usual PC keyboard produces a series of scancodes for each key
       press and key release. (Scancodes are shown by <b>showkey -s</b>, see
       <a href="../man1/showkey.1.html">showkey(1)</a> ) The kernel parses this stream of scancodes, and
       converts it to a stream of keycodes (key press/release events).
       (Keycodes are shown by <b>showkey</b>.)  Apart from a few scancodes with
       special meaning, and apart from the sequence produced by the
       Pause key, and apart from shiftstate related scancodes, and apart
       from the key up/down bit, the stream of scancodes consists of
       unescaped scancodes xx (7 bits) and escaped scancodes e0 xx (8+7
       bits).  To these scancodes or scancode pairs, a corresponding
       keycode can be assigned (in the range 1-127).  For example, if
       you have a Macro key that produces e0 6f according to <a href="../man1/showkey.1.html">showkey(1)</a>,
       the command
              <b>setkeycodes e06f 112</b>
       will assign the keycode 112 to it, and then <a href="../man1/loadkeys.1.html">loadkeys(1)</a> can be
       used to define the function of this key.

       Some older kernels might hardwire a low scancode range to the
       equivalent keycodes; setkeycodes will fail when you try to remap
       these.
</pre> <h2>
2.6 KERNELS </h2>
<pre>
       In 2.6 kernels key codes lie in the range 1-255, instead of
       1-127.  (It might be best to confine oneself to the range 1-239.)

       In 2.6 kernels raw mode, or scancode mode, is not very raw at
       all.  The code returned by showkey -s will change after use of
       setkeycodes.  A kernel bug. See also <a href="../man1/showkey.1.html">showkey(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The keycodes of X have nothing to do with those of Linux.
       Unusual keys can be made visible under Linux, but not under X.
