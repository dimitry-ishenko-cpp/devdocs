DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>Cron</i> is started from <i>/etc/rc.d/init.d</i> or <i>/etc/init.d</i> when
       classical sysvinit scripts are used. In case systemd is enabled,
       then unit file is installed into
       <i>/lib/systemd/system/crond.service</i> and daemon is started by
       <i>systemctl start crond.service</i> command. It returns immediately,
       thus, there is no need to need to start it with the '&amp;'
       parameter.

       <i>Cron</i> searches <i>/var/spool/cron</i> for crontab files which are named
       after accounts in <i>/etc/passwd;</i> The found crontabs are loaded into
       the memory.  <i>Cron</i> also searches for <i>/etc/anacrontab</i> and any files
       in the <i>/etc/cron.d</i> directory, which have a different format (see
       <a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab(5)</a>).  <i>Cron</i> examines all stored crontabs and checks each
       job to see if it needs to be run in the current minute.  When
       executing commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the
       crontab (or to the user specified in the <i>MAILTO</i> environment
       variable in the crontab, if such exists).  Any job output can
       also be sent to syslog by using the <b>-s </b>option.

       There are two ways how changes in crontables are checked.  The
       first method is checking the modtime of a file.  The second
       method is using the inotify support.  Using of inotify is logged
       in the <i>/var/log/cron</i> log after the daemon is started.  The
       inotify support checks for changes in all crontables and accesses
       the hard disk only when a change is detected.

       When using the modtime option, <i>Cron</i> checks its crontables'
       modtimes every minute to check for any changes and reloads the
       crontables which have changed.  There is no need to restart <i>Cron</i>
       after some of the crontables were modified.  The modtime option
       is also used when inotify can not be initialized.

       <i>Cron</i> checks these files and directories:

       <i>/etc/crontab</i>
              system crontab.  Nowadays the file is empty by default.
              Originally it was usually used to run daily, weekly,
              monthly jobs.  By default these jobs are now run through
              anacron which reads <i>/etc/anacrontab</i> configuration file.
              See <a href="../man5/anacrontab.5.html">anacrontab(5)</a> for more details.

       <i>/etc/cron.d/</i>
              directory that contains system cronjobs stored for
              different users.

       <i>/var/spool/cron</i>
              directory that contains user crontables created by the
              <i>crontab</i> command.

       Note that the <a href="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab(1)</a> command updates the modtime of the spool
       directory whenever it changes a crontab.

   <b>Daylight Saving Time and other time changes</b>
       Local time changes of less than three hours, such as those caused
       by the Daylight Saving Time changes, are handled in a special
       way.  This only applies to jobs that run at a specific time and
       jobs that run with a granularity greater than one hour.  Jobs
       that run more frequently are scheduled normally.

       If time was adjusted one hour forward, those jobs that would have
       run in the interval that has been skipped will be run
       immediately.  Conversely, if time was adjusted backward, running
       the same job twice is avoided.

       Time changes of more than 3 hours are considered to be
       corrections to the clock or the timezone, and the new time is
       used immediately.

       It is possible to use different time zones for crontables.  See
       <a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab(5)</a> for more information.

   <b>PAM Access Control</b>
       <i>Cron</i> supports access control with PAM if the system has PAM
       installed.  For more information, see <a href="pam.8.html">pam(8)</a>.  A PAM
       configuration file for <i>crond</i> is installed in <i>/etc/pam.d/crond</i>.
       The daemon loads the PAM environment from the pam_env module.
       This can be overridden by defining specific settings in the
       appropriate crontab file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-h     </b>Prints a help message and exits.

       <b>-i     </b>Disables inotify support.

       <b>-m     </b>This option allows you to specify a shell command to use
              for sending <i>Cron</i> mail output instead of using <a href="sendmail.8.html">sendmail(8)</a>
              This command must accept a fully formatted mail message
              (with headers) on standard input and send it as a mail
              message to the recipients specified in the mail headers.
              Specifying the string <i>off</i> (i.e., crond -m off) will
              disable the sending of mail.

       <b>-n     </b>Tells the daemon to run in the foreground.  This can be
              useful when starting it out of init. With this option is
              needed to change pam setting.  <i>/etc/pam.d/crond</i> must not
              enable <i>pam_loginuid.so</i> module.

       <b>-f     </b>the same as -n, consistent with other crond
              implementations.

       <b>-p     </b>Allows <i>Cron</i> to accept any user set crontables.

       <b>-P     </b>Don't set PATH.  PATH is instead inherited from the
              environment.

       <b>-c     </b>This option enables clustering support, as described
              below.

       <b>-s     </b>This option will direct <i>Cron</i> to send the job output to the
              system log using <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.  This is useful if your system
              does not have <a href="sendmail.8.html">sendmail(8)</a> installed or if mail is
              disabled.

       <b>-x     </b>This option allows you to set debug flags.

       <b>-V     </b>Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
SIGNALS </h2>
<pre>
       When the <i>SIGHUP</i> is received, the <i>Cron</i> daemon will close and
       reopen its log file.  This proves to be useful in scripts which
       rotate and age log files.  Naturally, this is not relevant if
       <i>Cron</i> was built to use <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
CLUSTERING SUPPORT </h2>
<pre>
       In this version of <i>Cron</i> it is possible to use a network-mounted
       shared <i>/var/spool/cron</i> across a cluster of hosts and specify that
       only one of the hosts should run the crontab jobs in this
       directory at any one time.  This is done by starting <i>Cron</i> with
       the <b>-c </b>option, and have the <i>/var/spool/cron/.cron.hostname</i> file
       contain just one line, which represents the hostname of whichever
       host in the cluster should run the jobs.  If this file does not
       exist, or the hostname in it does not match that returned by
       <a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname(2)</a>, then all crontab files in this directory are
       ignored.  This has no effect on cron jobs specified in the
       <i>/etc/crontab</i> file or on files in the <i>/etc/cron.d</i> directory.
       These files are always run and considered host-specific.

       Rather than editing <i>/var/spool/cron/.cron.hostname</i> directly, use
       the <b>-n </b>option of <a href="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab(1)</a> to specify the host.

       You should ensure that all hosts in a cluster, and the file
       server from which they mount the shared crontab directory, have
       closely synchronised clocks, e.g., using <b>ntpd</b>(8), otherwise the
       results will be very unpredictable.

       Using cluster sharing automatically disables inotify support,
       because inotify cannot be relied on with network-mounted shared
       file systems.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       All <b>crontab </b>files have to be regular files or symlinks to regular
       files, they must not be executable or writable for anyone else
       but the owner.  This requirement can be overridden by using the
       <b>-p </b>option on the crond command line.  If inotify support is in
       use, changes in the symlinked crontabs are not automatically
       noticed by the cron daemon.  The cron daemon must receive a
       SIGHUP signal to reload the crontabs.  This is a limitation of
       the inotify API.

       The syslog output will be used instead of mail, when sendmail is
       not installed.
