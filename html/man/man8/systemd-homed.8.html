SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-homed.service

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-homed
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-homed </b>is a system service that may be used to create,
       remove, change or inspect home areas (directories and network
       mounts and real or loopback block devices with a filesystem,
       optionally encrypted).

       Most of <b>systemd-homed</b>'s functionality is accessible through the
       <a href="../man1/homectl.1.html">homectl(1)</a> command.

       See the <b>Home Directories</b>[1] documentation for details about the
       format and design of home areas managed by systemd-homed.service.

       Each home directory managed by systemd-homed.service synthesizes
       a local user and group. These are made available to the system
       using the <b>User/Group Record Lookup API via Varlink</b>[2], and thus
       may be browsed with <a href="../man1/userdbctl.1.html">userdbctl(1)</a>.

       systemd-homed.service also manages blob directories for each home
       directory it manages. See <b>User Record Blob Directories</b>[3] for
       more details.

KEY MANAGEMENT </h2>
<pre>
       User records are cryptographically signed with a public/private
       key pair (the signature is part of the JSON record itself). For a
       user to be permitted to log in locally the public key matching
       the signature of their user record must be installed. For a user
       record to be modified locally the private key matching the
       signature must be installed locally, too. The keys are stored in
       the /var/lib/systemd/home/ directory:

       /var/lib/systemd/home/local.private
           The private key of the public/private key pair used for local
           records. Currently, only a single such key may be installed.

           Added in version 246.

       /var/lib/systemd/home/local.public
           The public key of the public/private key pair used for local
           records. Currently, only a single such key may be installed.

           Added in version 246.

       /var/lib/systemd/home/*.public
           Additional public keys. Any users whose user records are
           signed with any of these keys are permitted to log in
           locally. An arbitrary number of keys may be installed this
           way.

           Added in version 246.

       All key files listed above are in PEM format.

       In order to migrate a home directory from a host "foobar" to
       another host "quux" it is hence sufficient to copy
       /var/lib/systemd/home/local.public from the host "foobar" to
       "quux", maybe calling the file on the destination
       /var/lib/systemd/home/foobar.public, reflecting the origin of the
       key. If the user record should be modifiable on "quux" the pair
       /var/lib/systemd/home/local.public and
       /var/lib/systemd/home/local.private need to be copied from
       "foobar" to "quux", and placed under the identical paths there,
       as currently only a single private key is supported per host.
       Note of course that the latter means that user records
       generated/signed before the key pair is copied in, lose their
       validity.
