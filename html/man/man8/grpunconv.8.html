</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pwconv, pwunconv, grpconv, grpunconv - convert to and from shadow
       passwords and groups
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pwconv </b>[<i>options</i>]

       <b>pwunconv </b>[<i>options</i>]

       <b>grpconv </b>[<i>options</i>]

       <b>grpunconv </b>[<i>options</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pwconv </b>command creates <i>shadow</i> from <i>passwd</i> and an optionally
       existing <i>shadow</i>.

       The <b>pwunconv </b>command creates <i>passwd</i> from <i>passwd</i> and <i>shadow</i> and
       then removes <i>shadow</i>.

       The <b>grpconv </b>command creates <i>gshadow</i> from <i>group</i> and an optionally
       existing <i>gshadow</i>.

       The <b>grpunconv </b>command creates <i>group</i> from <i>group</i> and <i>gshadow</i> and
       then removes <i>gshadow</i>.

       These four programs all operate on the normal and shadow password
       and group files: /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/shadow, and
       /etc/gshadow.

       Each program acquires the necessary locks before conversion.
       <b>pwconv </b>and <b>grpconv </b>are similar. First, entries in the shadowed
       file which don't exist in the main file are removed. Then,
       shadowed entries which don't have `x' as the password in the main
       file are updated. Any missing shadowed entries are added.
       Finally, passwords in the main file are replaced with `x'. These
       programs can be used for initial conversion as well to update the
       shadowed file if the main file is edited by hand.

       <b>pwconv </b>will use the values of <i>PASS_MIN_DAYS</i>, <i>PASS_MAX_DAYS</i>, and
       <i>PASS_WARN_AGE</i> from /etc/login.defs when adding new entries to
       /etc/shadow.

       Likewise <b>pwunconv </b>and <b>grpunconv </b>are similar. Passwords in the
       main file are updated from the shadowed file. Entries which exist
       in the main file but not in the shadowed file are left alone.
       Finally, the shadowed file is removed. Some password aging
       information is lost by <b>pwunconv</b>. It will convert what it can.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The options which apply to the <b>pwconv</b>, <b>pwunconv</b>, <b>grpconv</b>, and
       <b>grpunconv </b>commands are:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help message and exit.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root </b><i>CHROOT_DIR</i>
           Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use the
           configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only
           absolute paths are supported.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Errors in the password or group files (such as invalid or
       duplicate entries) may cause these programs to loop forever or
       fail in other strange ways. Please run <b>pwck </b>and <b>grpck </b>to correct
       any such errors before converting to or from shadow passwords or
       groups.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The following configuration variable in /etc/login.defs changes
       the behavior of <b>grpconv </b>and <b>grpunconv</b>:

       <b>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP </b>(number)
           Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached,
           a new group entry (line) is started in /etc/group (with the
           same name, same password, and same GID).

           The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in
           the number of members in a group.

           This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of
           lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
           lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters.

           If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

           Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in
           the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable
           unless you really need it.

       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
       the behavior of <b>pwconv</b>:

       <b>PASS_MAX_DAYS </b>(number)
           The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the
           password is older than this, a password change will be
           forced. If not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables
           the restriction).

       <b>PASS_MIN_DAYS </b>(number)
           The minimum number of days allowed between password changes.
           Any password changes attempted sooner than this will be
           rejected. If not specified, 0 will be assumed (which disables
           the restriction).

       <b>PASS_WARN_AGE </b>(number)
           The number of days warning given before a password expires. A
           zero means warning is given only upon the day of expiration,
           a value of -1 means no warning is given. If not specified, no
           warning will be provided.
