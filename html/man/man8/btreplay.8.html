NAME </h2>
<pre>
       btreplay - recreate IO loads recorded by blktrace
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>btreplay [ </b><i>options</i> ] &lt;<i>dev</i>...&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>btrecord</i> and <i>btreplay</i> tools provide the ability to record and
       replay IOs captured by the <i>blktrace</i> utility. Attempts are made to
       maintain ordering, CPU mappings and time-separation of IOs.

       The <i>blktrace</i> utility provides the ability to collect detailed
       traces from the kernel for each IO processed by the block IO
       layer. The traces provide a complete timeline for each IO
       processed, including detailed information concerning when an IO
       was first received by the block IO layer — indicating the device,
       CPU number, time stamp, IO direction, sector number and IO size
       (number of sectors). Using this information, one is able to
       <b>replay </b>the IO again on the same machine or another set up
       entirely.

       The basic operating work-flow to replay IOs would be something
       like:

       -
           Run <i>blktrace</i> to collect traces. Here you specify the
           device or devices that you wish to trace and later replay IOs
         upon. Note:
           the only traces you are interested in are <b>QUEUE </b>requests —
           thus, to save system resources (including storage for
         traces), one could
           specify the <i>-a queue</i> command line option to <i>blktrace</i>.

       -
           While <i>blktrace</i> is running, you run the workload that you
           are interested in.

       -
           When the work load has completed, you stop the <i>blktrace</i>
           utility (thus saving all traces over the complete workload).

       -
           You extract the pertinent IO information from the traces
         saved by
           <i>blktrace</i> using the <i>btrecord</i> utility. This will parse
           each trace file created by <i>blktrace</i>, and crafty IO
         descriptions
           to be used in the next phase of the workload processing.

       -
           Once <i>btrecord</i> has successfully created a series of data
           files to be processed, you can run the <i>btreplay</i> utility which
           attempts to generate the same IOs seen during the sample
         workload phase.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -c &lt;<i>num</i>&gt;
       --cpus=&lt;<i>num</i>&gt;
              Set number of CPUs to use.

       -d &lt;<i>dir</i>&gt;
       --input-directory=&lt;<i>dir</i>&gt;
              Set input directory.  This option requires a single
              parameter providing the directory name for where input
              files are to be found. The default directory is the
              current directory (<i>.</i>).

       -F
       --find-records
              Find record files automatically This option instructs
              <i>btreplay</i> to go find all the record files in the directory
              specified (either via the <i>-d</i> option, or in the default
              directory (<i>.</i>).

       -h
       --help
              Show help and exit.

       -i &lt;<i>basename</i>&gt;
       --input-base=&lt;<i>basename</i>&gt;
              Set base name for input files.  Each input file has 3
              fields:

              1.
                  Device identifier (taken directly from the device name
                 of the
                  <i>blktrace</i> output file).

              2.
                  <i>btrecord</i> base name — by default ``replay''.

              3.
                  The CPU number (again, taken directly from the
                  <i>blktrace</i> output file name).

              This option requires a single parameter that will override
              the default name (replay), and replace it with the
              specified value.

       -I &lt;<i>num</i>&gt;
       --iterations=&lt;<i>num</i>&gt;
              Set number of iterations to run.  This option requires a
              single parameter which specifies the number of times to
              run through the input files. The default value is 1

       -M &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;
       --map-devs=&lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;
              Specify device mappings.  This option requires a single
              parameter which specifies the name of a file contain
              device mappings. The file must be very simply managed,
              with just two pieces of data per line:

              -
                  The device name on the recorded system (with the
                '<i>/dev/</i>'
                  removed). Example: <i>/dev/sda</i> would just be <i>sda</i>.

              -
                  The device name on the replay system to use (again,
                without the
                  '<i>/dev/</i>' path prepended).

              An example file for when one would map devices <i>/dev/sda</i>
              and <i>/dev/sdb</i> on the recorded system to <i>dev/sdg</i> and <i>sdh</i> on
              the replay system would be:

                     sda sdg
                     sdb sdh

              The only entries in the file that are allowed are these
              two element lines — we do not (yet?) support the notion of
              blank lines, or comment lines, or the like.

              The utility allows for multiple <i>-M</i> options to be supplied
              on the command line.

       -N
       --no-stalls
              Disable pre-bunch stalls.  When specified on the command
              line, all pre-bunch stall indicators will be ignored. IOs
              will be replayed without inter-bunch delays.

       -x &lt;<i>factor</i>&gt;
       --acc-factor=&lt;<i>factor</i>&gt;
              Specify acceleration factor. Default value is 1 (no
              acceleration).

       -v
       --verbose
              Enable verbose output.  When specified on the command
              line, this option instructs <i>btreplay</i> to store information
              concerning each <b>stall </b>and IO operation performed by
              <i>btreplay</i>. The name of each file so created will be the
              input file name used with an extension of <i>.rep</i> appended
              onto it. Thus, an input file of the name <i>sdab.replay.3</i>
              would generate a verbose output file with the name
              <i>sdab.replay.3.rep</i> in the directory specified for input
              files.

              In addition, <i>btreplay</i> will also output to <i>stderr</i> the names
              of the input files being processed.

       -V
       --version
              Show version number and exit.

       -W
       --write-enable
              Enable writing during replay.  As a precautionary measure,
              by default <i>btreplay</i> will not process <b>write </b>requests. In
              order to enable <i>btreplay</i> to actually <b>write </b>to devices one
              must explicitly specify the <i>-W</i> option.
