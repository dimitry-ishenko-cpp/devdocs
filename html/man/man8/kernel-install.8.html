</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>kernel-install </b>is used to install and remove kernel and initrd
       images [1] to and from the boot loader partition, referred to as
       <i>$BOOT</i> here. It will usually be one of /boot/, /efi/, or
       /boot/efi/, see below.

       <b>kernel-install </b>will run the executable files ("plugins") located
       in the directory /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/ and the local
       administration directory /etc/kernel/install.d/. All files are
       collectively sorted and executed in lexical order, regardless of
       the directory in which they live. However, files with identical
       filenames replace each other. Files in /etc/kernel/install.d/
       take precedence over files with the same name in
       /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/. This can be used to override a
       system-supplied executables with a local file if needed; a
       symbolic link in /etc/kernel/install.d/ with the same name as an
       executable in /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/, pointing to /dev/null,
       disables the executable entirely. Executables must have the
       extension ".install"; other extensions are ignored.

       An executable placed in these directories should return <b>0 </b>on
       success. It may also return <b>77 </b>to cause the whole operation to
       terminate (executables later in lexical order will be skipped).
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>add [[[</b><i>KERNEL-VERSION</i><b>] </b><i>KERNEL-IMAGE</i><b>] [</b><i>INITRD-FILE</i> <b>...]]</b>
           This command takes a kernel version string and a path to a
           kernel image file as arguments. If the former is omitted,
           specified as an empty string or as "-" it defaults to the
           current kernel version, i.e. the same string <b>uname -r</b>
           returns. If the latter is omitted, specified as an empty
           string or as "-" defaults to
           /usr/lib/modules/<i>KERNEL_VERSION</i>/vmlinuz. Optionally, one or
           more initrd images may be specified as well (note that
           plugins might generate additional ones).

           The executable files from /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/*.install
           and /etc/kernel/install.d/*.install (i.e. the plugins) are
           called with the following arguments:

               add <i>KERNEL-VERSION</i> $BOOT/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>/<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>/ <i>KERNEL-IMAGE</i> \
                         [<i>INITRD-FILE</i> ...]

           The third argument directly refers to the path where to place
           kernel images, initrd images and other resources for <b>Boot</b>
           <b>Loader Specification</b>[2] Type #1 entries (the "entry
           directory"). If other boot loader schemes are used the
           parameter may be ignored.

           The <i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i> string is typically the machine ID and is
           supposed to identify the local installation on the system.
           For details see below.

           Two default plugins execute the following operations in this
           case:

           •   <b>kernel-install </b>creates $BOOT/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>/<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>,
               if enabled (see <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_LAYOUT</i>).

           •   50-depmod.install runs <a href="depmod.8.html">depmod(8)</a> for the <i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>.

           •   90-loaderentry.install copies <i>KERNEL-IMAGE</i> to
               $BOOT/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>/<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>/linux. If <i>INITRD-FILE</i>s
               are provided, it also copies them to
               $BOOT/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>/<i>KERNEL_VERSION</i>/<i>INITRD-FILE</i>. This can
               also be used to prepend microcode before the actual
               initrd. It also creates a boot loader entry according to
               the <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[2] (Type #1) in
               $BOOT/loader/entries/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>-<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>.conf. The
               title of the entry is the <i>PRETTY_NAME</i> parameter specified
               in /etc/os-release or /usr/lib/os-release (if the former
               is missing), or "Linux <i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>", if unset.

               If <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_LAYOUT</i> is not "bls", this plugin does
               nothing.

           •   90-uki-copy.install copies a file uki.efi from
               <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_STAGING_AREA</i> or if it does not exist the
               <i>KERNEL-IMAGE</i> argument, only if it has a ".efi" extension,
               to $BOOT/EFI/Linux/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>-<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>.efi.

               If <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_LAYOUT</i> is not "uki", this plugin does
               nothing.

           Added in version 198.

       <b>add-all</b>
           This is the same as <b>add </b>(see above), but invokes the
           operation iteratively for every installed kernel in
           /usr/lib/modules/. This operation is only supported on
           systems where the kernel image is installed in
           /usr/lib/modules/<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>/vmlinuz.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>remove </b><i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>
           This command expects a kernel version string as single
           argument.

           The executable files from /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/*.install
           and /etc/kernel/install.d/*.install (i.e. the plugins) are
           called with the following arguments:

               remove <i>KERNEL-VERSION</i> $BOOT/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>/<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>/

           Afterwards, <b>kernel-install </b>removes the entry directory
           $BOOT/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>/<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>/ and its contents, if it
           exists.

           Two default plugins execute the following operations in this
           case:

           •   50-depmod.install removes the files generated by <b>depmod</b>
               for this kernel again.

           •   90-loaderentry.install removes the file
               $BOOT/loader/entries/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>-<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>.conf.

           •   90-uki-copy.install removes the file
               $BOOT/EFI/Linux/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>-<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>.efi.

           Added in version 198.

       <b>inspect [[[</b><i>KERNEL-VERSION</i><b>] </b><i>KERNEL-IMAGE</i><b>] [</b><i>INITRD-FILE</i> <b>...]]</b>
           Takes the same parameters as <b>add</b>.

           Shows the various paths and parameters configured or
           auto-detected. In particular shows the values of the various
           <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_*</i> environment variables listed below, as they
           would be passed to plugins. The <b>--json </b>option can be used to
           get the output of this verb as a JSON object.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>list</b>
           Shows the various installed kernels. This enumerates the
           subdirectories of /usr/lib/modules/, and shows whether a
           kernel image is installed there.

           Added in version 255.
</pre> <h2>
COMPATIBILITY WITH THE KERNEL BUILD SYSTEM </h2>
<pre>

       <b>installkernel </b>[OPTIONS...] VERSION VMLINUZ [MAP]
                     [INSTALLATION-DIR]

       When invoked as <b>installkernel</b>, this program accepts arguments as
       specified by the kernel build system's <b>make install </b>command. The
       <i>VERSION</i> and <i>VMLINUZ</i> parameters specify the kernel version and the
       kernel binary. The other two parameters (<i>MAP</i> and
       <i>INSTALLATION-DIR</i>) are currently ignored.
</pre> <h2>
THE $BOOT PARTITION </h2>
<pre>
       The partition where the kernels and <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[2]
       snippets are located is called <i>$BOOT</i>.  <b>kernel-install </b>determines
       the location of this partition by checking /efi/, /boot/, and
       /boot/efi/ in turn. The first location where
       $BOOT/loader/entries/ or $BOOT/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>/ exists is used.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--esp-path=</b>
           Path to the EFI System Partition (ESP). If not specified,
           /efi/, /boot/, and /boot/efi/ are checked in turn. It is
           recommended to mount the ESP to /efi/, if possible.

       <b>--boot-path=</b>
           Path to the Extended Boot Loader partition, as defined in the
           <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[2]. If not specified, /boot/ is
           checked. It is recommended to mount the Extended Boot Loader
           partition to /boot/, if possible.

       <b>--make-entry-directory=yes|no|auto</b>
           Controls creation and deletion of the <b>Boot Loader</b>
           <b>Specification</b>[2] Type #1 entry directory on the file system
           containing resources such as kernel and initrd images during
           <b>add </b>and <b>remove</b>, respectively. The directory is named after
           the entry token, and is placed immediately below the boot
           root directory. When "auto", the directory is created or
           removed only when the install layout is "bls". Defaults to
           "auto".

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--entry-token=</b>
           Controls how to name and identify boot loader entries for
           this kernel installation or deletion. Takes one of "auto",
           "machine-id", "os-id", "os-image-id", or an arbitrary string
           prefixed by "literal:" as argument.

           If set to <b>machine-id </b>the entries are named after the machine
           ID of the running system (e.g.
           "b0e793a9baf14b5fa13ecbe84ff637ac"). See <a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a> for
           details about the machine ID concept and file.

           If set to <b>os-id </b>the entries are named after the OS ID of the
           running system, i.e. the <i>ID=</i> field of <a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release(5)</a> (e.g.
           "fedora"). Similarly, if set to <b>os-image-id </b>the entries are
           named after the OS image ID of the running system, i.e. the
           <i>IMAGE_ID=</i> field of os-release (e.g.
           "vendorx-cashier-system").

           If set to <b>auto </b>(the default), the /etc/kernel/entry-token (or
           $KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT/entry-token) file will be read if
           it exists, and the stored value used. Otherwise if the local
           machine ID is initialized it is used. Otherwise <i>IMAGE_ID=</i>
           from os-release will be used, if set. Otherwise, <i>ID=</i> from
           os-release will be used, if set. Otherwise a randomly
           generated machine ID is used.

           Using the machine ID for naming the entries is generally
           preferable, however there are cases where using the other
           identifiers is a good option. Specifically: if the
           identification data that the machine ID entails shall not be
           stored on the (unencrypted) <i>$BOOT_ROOT</i> partition, or if the
           ID shall be generated on first boot and is not known when the
           entries are prepared. Note that using the machine ID has the
           benefit that multiple parallel installations of the same OS
           can coexist on the same medium, and they can update their
           boot loader entries independently. When using another
           identifier (such as the OS ID or the OS image ID), parallel
           installations of the same OS would try to use the same entry
           name. To support parallel installations, the installer must
           use a different entry token when adding a second
           installation.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Output additional information about operations being
           performed.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>--root=</b><i>root</i>
           Takes a directory path as an argument. All paths will be
           prefixed with the given alternate <i>root</i> path, including config
           search paths. This is useful to operate on a system image
           mounted to the specified directory instead of the host system
           itself.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--image=</b><i>image</i>
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If
           specified, all operations are applied to the file system in
           the indicated disk image. This option is similar to <b>--root=</b>,
           but operates on file systems stored in disk images or block
           devices. The disk image should either contain just a file
           system or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table,
           following the <b>Discoverable Partitions Specification</b>[3]. For
           further information on supported disk images, see
           <a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a>'s switch of the same name.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--json=</b><i>MODE</i>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for
           the shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace
           or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same,
           with indentation and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON
           output, the default).

       <b>--image-policy=</b><i>policy</i>
           Takes an image policy string as argument, as per
           <a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy(7)</a>. The policy is enforced when
           operating on the disk image specified via <b>--image=</b>, see
           above. If not specified defaults to the "*" policy, i.e. all
           recognized file systems in the image are used.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer
           with hints.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Environment variables exported for plugins</b>
       If <b>--verbose </b>is used, <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_VERBOSE=1</i> will be exported
       for plugins. They may output additional logs in this case.

       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_IMAGE_TYPE=uki|pe|unknown</i> is set for the plugins
       to specify the type of the kernel image.

       uki
           Unified kernel image.

           Added in version 254.

       pe
           PE binary.

           Added in version 254.

       unknown
           Unknown type.

           Added in version 254.

       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_MACHINE_ID</i> is set for the plugins to the desired
       machine-id to use. It's always a 128-bit ID. Normally it's read
       from /etc/machine-id, but it can also be overridden via
       <i>$MACHINE_ID</i> (see below). If not specified via these methods, a
       fallback value will generated by <b>kernel-install </b>and used only for
       a single invocation.

       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_ENTRY_TOKEN</i> is set for the plugins to the desired
       entry "token" to use. It's an identifier that shall be used to
       identify the local installation, and is often the machine ID,
       i.e. same as <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_MACHINE_ID</i>, but might also be a
       different type of identifier, for example a fixed string or the
       <i>ID=</i>, <i>IMAGE_ID=</i> values from /etc/os-release. The string passed
       here will be used to name Boot Loader Specification entries, or
       the directories the kernel image and initial RAM disk images are
       placed into.

       Note that while <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_ENTRY_TOKEN</i> and
       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_MACHINE_ID</i> are often set to the same value, the
       latter is guaranteed to be a valid 32 character ID in lowercase
       hexadecimals while the former can be any short string. The entry
       token to use is read from /etc/kernel/entry-token, if it exists.
       Otherwise a few possible candidates below <i>$BOOT</i> are checked for
       Boot Loader Specification Type 1 entry directories, and if found
       the entry token is derived from that. If that is not successful,
       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_MACHINE_ID</i> is used as fallback.

       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_BOOT_ROOT</i> is set for the plugins to the absolute
       path of the root directory (mount point, usually) of the
       hierarchy where boot loader entries, kernel images, and
       associated resources should be placed. This usually is the path
       where the XBOOTLDR partition or the ESP (EFI System Partition)
       are mounted, and also conceptually referred to as <i>$BOOT</i>. Can be
       overridden by setting <i>$BOOT_ROOT</i> (see below).

       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_LAYOUT=auto|bls|uki|other|...</i>  is set for the
       plugins to specify the installation layout. Additional layout
       names may be defined by convention. If a plugin uses a special
       layout, it's encouraged to declare its own layout name and
       configure <i>layout=</i> in install.conf upon initial installation. The
       following values are currently understood:

       bls
           Standard <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[2] Type #1 layout,
           compatible with <a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a>: entries in
           $BOOT/loader/entries/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>-<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>[+<i>TRIES</i>].conf,
           kernel and initrds under $BOOT/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>/<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>/

           Implemented by 90-loaderentry.install.

           Added in version 250.

       uki
           Standard <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[2] Type #2 layout,
           compatible with <a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a>: unified kernel images under
           $BOOT/EFI/Linux as
           $BOOT/EFI/Linux/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>-<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>[+<i>TRIES</i>].efi.

           Implemented by 90-uki-copy.install.

           Added in version 253.

       other
           Some other layout not understood natively by <b>kernel-install</b>.

           Added in version 250.

       auto
           Pick the layout automatically. If the kernel is a UKI set
           layout to <b>uki</b>. If not default to <b>bls </b>if
           $BOOT/loader/entries.srel with content "type1" or
           $BOOT/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i> exists, or <b>other </b>otherwise.

           Leaving layout blank has the same effect. This is the
           default.

           Added in version 254.

       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_INITRD_GENERATOR</i> and
       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_UKI_GENERATOR</i> are set for plugins to select the
       initrd and/or UKI generator. This may be configured as
       <i>initrd_generator=</i> and <i>uki_generator=</i> in install.conf, see below.

       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_STAGING_AREA</i> is set for plugins to a path to a
       directory. Plugins may drop files in that directory, and they
       will be installed as part of the loader entry, based on the file
       name and extension: Files named initrd* will be installed as
       <i>INITRD-FILE</i>s, and files named microcode* will be prepended before
       <i>INITRD-FILE</i>s.

   <b>Environment variables understood by kernel-install</b>
       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</i> can be set to override the location of
       the configuration files read by <b>kernel-install</b>. When set,
       install.conf, entry-token, and other files will be read from this
       directory only. Note that this path is relative to the host, and
       in particular <i>symlinks in this directory are resolved relative to</i>
       <i>the host</i>, even if <b>--root=</b><i>root</i> is used. This means that it is
       generally <i>not</i> correct to use this variable to specify a directory
       underneath <i>root</i> if symlinks are used there.

       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_PLUGINS</i> can be set to override the list of
       plugins executed by <b>kernel-install</b>. The argument is a
       whitespace-separated list of paths.  "KERNEL_INSTALL_PLUGINS=:"
       may be used to prevent any plugins from running.

       <i>$MACHINE_ID</i> can be set for <b>kernel-install </b>to override
       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_MACHINE_ID</i>, the machine ID.

       <i>$BOOT_ROOT</i> can be set for <b>kernel-install </b>to override
       <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_BOOT_ROOT</i>, the installation location for boot
       entries.

       The last two variables may also be set in install.conf. Variables
       set in the environment take precedence over the values specified
       in the config file.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       If every executable returns 0 or 77, 0 is returned, and a
       non-zero failure code otherwise.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/kernel/install.d/*.install,
       /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/*.install
           Drop-in files which are executed by <b>kernel-install</b>.

           Added in version 198.

       /etc/kernel/cmdline, /usr/lib/kernel/cmdline, /proc/cmdline
           Specifies the kernel command line to use. The first of the
           files that is found will be used.  <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</i>
           may be used to override the search path; see below for
           details.

           Added in version 198.

       /etc/kernel/devicetree, /usr/lib/kernel/devicetree
           Specifies the partial path to the file containing the device
           tree blob to install with the kernel and use at boot. The
           first of the files that is found will be used.
           <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</i> may be used to override the search
           path; see below for details.

           The devicetree file contains a path, and this path specifies
           a location relative to the kernel install tree. A set of
           locations is checked, including in particular
           /usr/lib/modules/<i>KERNEL_VERSION</i>/dtb/, which is the
           recommended location to place the dtb files under. For
           example, with "broadcom/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb" in the
           devicetree file, the device tree blob for the Raspberry Pi 4
           Model B would be installed, and the actual file would be
           /usr/lib/modules/<i>KERNEL_VERSION</i>/dtb/broadcom/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb.

           Added in version 255.

       /etc/kernel/tries
           Read by 90-loaderentry.install and 90-uki-copy.install. If
           this file exists, a numeric value is read from it and the
           naming of the generated entry file or UKI is altered to
           include it as
           $BOOT/loader/entries/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>-<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>+<i>TRIES</i>.conf or
           $BOOT/EFI/Linux/<i>ENTRY-TOKEN</i>-<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>+<i>TRIES</i>.efi,
           respectively. This is useful for boot loaders such as
           <a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a> which implement boot attempt counting with a
           counter embedded in the entry file name.
           <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</i> may be used to override the search
           path; see below for details.

           Added in version 240.

       /etc/kernel/entry-token
           If this file exists it is read and used as "entry token" for
           this system, i.e. is used for naming Boot Loader
           Specification entries. See <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_ENTRY_TOKEN</i> above
           for details.  <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</i> may be used to
           override the search path; see below for details.

           Added in version 251.

       /etc/machine-id
           The content of this file specifies the machine identification
           <i>MACHINE-ID</i>.

           Added in version 198.

       /etc/os-release, /usr/lib/os-release
           Read by 90-loaderentry.install. If available, <i>PRETTY_NAME=</i> is
           read from these files and used as the title of the boot menu
           entry. Otherwise, "Linux <i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>" will be used.

           Added in version 198.

       /etc/kernel/install.conf, /run/kernel/install.conf,
       /usr/local/lib/kernel/install.conf, /usr/lib/kernel/install.conf,
       /etc/kernel/install.conf.d/*.conf,
       /run/kernel/install.conf.d/*.conf,
       /usr/local/lib/kernel/install.conf.d/*.conf,
       /usr/lib/kernel/install.conf.d/*.conf
           Configuration file with options for <b>kernel-install</b>, as a
           series of <i>KEY=VALUE</i> assignments, compatible with shell
           syntax, following the same rules as described in
           <a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release(5)</a>. The first of the files that is found will be
           used.  <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</i> may be used to override the
           search path; see below for details. Drop-in files may also be
           used to extend the configuration with overrides, see
           <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>.

           Currently, the following keys are supported: <i>MACHINE_ID=</i>,
           <i>BOOT_ROOT=</i>, <i>layout=</i>, <i>initrd_generator=</i>, <i>uki_generator=</i>. See
           the Environment variables section above for details.

           Added in version 250.

       /etc/kernel/uki.conf
           Ini-style configuration file for <a href="../man1/ukify.1.html">ukify(1)</a> which is only
           effective when <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_LAYOUT</i> or <i>layout=</i> in
           install.conf is set to <b>uki </b>and <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_UKI_GENERATOR</i>
           or <i>uki_generator=</i> in install.conf is set to <b>ukify</b>, or is
           unset.  <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</i> may be used to override the
           search path; see below for details.

           Added in version 255.

       /usr/lib/modules/<i>KERNEL-VERSION/</i>
           Location for installed kernel modules and other kernel
           related resources. For each locally installed kernel a
           directory named after the kernel version (<b>uname -r</b>) is kept.

           Added in version 255.

       /usr/lib/modules/<i>KERNEL-VERSION/vmlinuz</i>
           Location for installed kernel images. This is the recommended
           location for OS package managers to install kernel images
           into (as applicable), from which <b>kernel-install add </b>then
           copies it into the final boot partition.

           Added in version 255.

       For various cases listed above, if the <i>$KERNEL_INSTALL_CONF_ROOT</i>
       environment variable is set, it will override the search path.
       The files will be loaded <i>only</i> from the directory specified by the
       environment variable. When the variable is not set, the listed
       paths are tried in turn, and the first file that exists is used.
