DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>xfsdump</i> maintains an online dump inventory in
       <i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i>.  The <b>-I </b>option of xfsdump displays
       the inventory contents hierarchically.  The levels of the
       hierarchy are: filesystem, dump session, stream, and media file.

       <i>xfsinvutil</i> is a utility to check this inventory database for
       consistency, to remove entries of dump sessions which may no
       longer be of relevance, and to browse the contents of the
       inventory.

       The following command line options are available:

       <b>-F   </b>Don't prompt the operator.  When <i>xfsinvutil</i> encounters a
            matching dump session, <i>xfsinvutil</i> will normally ask the
            operator for permission to delete the entry. With this
            option the deletion is performed, no questions asked.

       <b>-i   </b>Interactive mode.  Causes <i>xfsinvutil</i> to run in a mode that
            will allow the operator to browse and modify the contents of
            the inventory. Please refer to the <b>Interactive Mode </b>section
            below for more information.

       <b>-M </b><i>mount_point mm/dd/yyyy</i>
            Prunes dump sessions identified by the given mount point
            which were created prior to the specified date. Optionally
            <b>-m </b>may be be specified to further limit the matching dump
            sessions by media label.  <i>xfsinvutil</i> will prompt the
            operator prior to pruning a dump session unless the <b>-F </b>or <b>-i</b>
            options are given.

       <b>-u </b><i>UUID mm/dd/yyyy</i>
            Like <b>-M</b>, except the matching filesystem is specified using
            its universally unique identifier (UUID) instead of its
            mount point.

       <b>-m </b><i>media_label</i>
            If specified, only sessions with at least one media file
            whose label matches this value will be eligible for pruning.
            This restriction is in addition to those imposed by the date
            and the <b>-M </b>or <b>-u </b>options.  This option allows the pruning of
            all inventory references to media which may have been
            overwritten or lost. Note that this option does not apply to
            sessions with no media files.

       <b>-s </b><i>SESSION_ID</i>
            Prunes the dump session identified by the given session id.
            <i>xfsinvutil</i> will prompt the operator prior to pruning a dump
            session unless the <b>-F </b>option is given.

       <b>-C   </b>With this option, <i>xfsinvutil</i> performs consistency checks for
            all entries in the inventory database.  It fixes any
            problems found. If no consistent entries are found , the
            corresponding inventory database file is removed.

   <b>Interactive Mode</b>
       When run with <b>-i</b>, <i>xfsinvutil</i> will present the operator with a
       hierarchical representation of the <i>xfsdump</i> inventory.  In this
       mode, the operator can use the arrow keys (or the <b>h j k l </b>keys)
       to navigate the inventory and also use the following keys and
       functionality:

       <b>+    </b>Expand a branch of the tree.

       <b>-    </b>Collapse a branch of the tree.

       <b>*    </b>Fully expand a branch of the tree.

       <b>%    </b>Fully collapse a branch of the tree.

       <b>h    </b>Move selection to the parent entry.

       <b>l    </b>Move selection to the child entry.

       <b>j    </b>Move selection to next entry.

       <b>k    </b>Move selection to previous entry.

       <b>d    </b>Mark the current record, and all sub-records, to be deleted.

       <b>u    </b>Clear the current record and all parent records from being
            deleted.

       <b>i    </b>Import another <i>xfsdump</i> inventory.

       <b>?    </b>Show help window.

       <b>x    </b>Commit any changes made to the inventory, and exit the
            program.

       <b>q    </b>Exit the program without committing any changes to the
            inventory.

       Inventories from other hosts can be imported to create a larger
       common inventory.  It is recommended that the contents of
       <i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i> on the remote host be copied to a
       temporary local directory prior to running <i>xfsinvutil</i>.  When
       <i>xfsinvutil</i> is run in interactive mode, and the operator hits <b>i</b>,
       they will be prompted for the path to the inventory to be
       imported.  <i>xfsinvutil</i> will then add the contents of the imported
       inventory to the main window, and all entries will be marked as
       imported.  The operator can then delete any of these entries that
       are not to be imported.  When the operator commits the changes,
       <i>xfsinvutil</i> will import any entries which were not marked as
       deleted.  Deleted entries are not actually deleted from the
       original imported inventory.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Inventory</b>
       Each dump session updates an inventory database in
       <i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i>.  <i>xfsdump</i> uses the inventory to
       determine the base of incremental and resumed dumps.

       This database can be displayed by invoking <i>xfsdump</i> with the <b>-I</b>
       option.  The display uses tabbed indentation to present the
       inventory hierarchically.  The first level is filesystem.  The
       second level is session.  The third level is media stream
       (currently only one stream is supported).  The fourth level lists
       the media files sequentially composing the stream.
