       wg - set and retrieve configuration of WireGuard interfaces
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>wg </b>[ <i>COMMAND</i> ] [ <i>OPTIONS</i> ]... [ <i>ARGS</i> ]...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>wg </b>is the configuration utility for getting and setting the
       configuration of WireGuard tunnel interfaces. The interfaces
       themselves can be added and removed using <a href="ip-link.8.html">ip-link(8)</a> and their IP
       addresses and routing tables can be set using <a href="ip-address.8.html">ip-address(8)</a> and
       <a href="ip-route.8.html">ip-route(8)</a>.  The <b>wg </b>utility provides a series of sub-commands
       for changing WireGuard-specific aspects of WireGuard interfaces.

       If no COMMAND is specified, COMMAND defaults to <b>show</b>.  Sub-
       commands that take an INTERFACE must be passed a WireGuard
       interface.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>show </b>{ <i>&lt;interface&gt;</i> | <i>all</i> | <i>interfaces</i> } [<i>public-key</i> | <i>private-key</i>
       | <i>listen-port</i> | <i>fwmark</i> | <i>peers</i> | <i>preshared-keys</i> | <i>endpoints</i> |
       <i>allowed-ips</i> | <i>latest-handshakes</i> | <i>persistent-keepalive</i> | <i>transfer</i>
       | <i>dump</i>]
              Shows current WireGuard configuration and runtime
              information of specified <i>&lt;interface&gt;</i>.  If no <i>&lt;interface&gt;</i>
              is specified, <i>&lt;interface&gt;</i> defaults to <i>all</i>.  If <i>interfaces</i>
              is specified, prints a list of all WireGuard interfaces,
              one per line, and quits. If no options are given after the
              interface specification, then prints a list of all
              attributes in a visually pleasing way meant for the
              terminal. Otherwise, prints specified information grouped
              by newlines and tabs, meant to be used in scripts. For
              this script-friendly display, if <i>all</i> is specified, then
              the first field for all categories of information is the
              interface name. If <i>dump</i> is specified, then several lines
              are printed; the first contains in order separated by tab:
              private-key, public-key, listen-port, fwmark. Subsequent
              lines are printed for each peer and contain in order
              separated by tab: public-key, preshared-key, endpoint,
              allowed-ips, latest-handshake, transfer-rx, transfer-tx,
              persistent-keepalive.

       <b>showconf </b><i>&lt;interface&gt;</i>
              Shows the current configuration of <i>&lt;interface&gt;</i> in the
              format described by <i>CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT</i> below.

       <b>set </b><i>&lt;interface&gt;</i> [<i>listen-port &lt;port&gt;</i>] [<i>fwmark &lt;fwmark&gt;</i>] [<i>private-</i>
       <i>key &lt;file-path&gt;</i>] [<i>peer &lt;base64-public-key&gt;</i> [<i>remove</i>] [<i>preshared-</i>
       <i>key &lt;file-path&gt;</i>] [<i>endpoint &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</i>] [<i>persistent-keepalive</i>
       <i>&lt;interval seconds&gt;</i>] [<i>allowed-ips</i>
       <i>&lt;ip1&gt;/&lt;cidr1&gt;</i>[,<i>&lt;ip2&gt;/&lt;cidr2&gt;</i>]...] ]...
              Sets configuration values for the specified <i>&lt;interface&gt;</i>.
              Multiple <i>peer</i>s may be specified, and if the <i>remove</i>
              argument is given for a peer, that peer is removed, not
              configured. If <i>listen-port</i> is not specified, or set to 0,
              the port will be chosen randomly when the interface comes
              up. Both <i>private-key</i> and <i>preshared-key</i> must be files,
              because command line arguments are not considered private
              on most systems but if you are using <a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash(1)</a>, you may
              safely pass in a string by specifying as <i>private-key</i> or
              <i>preshared-key</i> the expression: &lt;(echo PRIVATEKEYSTRING). If
              <i>/dev/null</i> or another empty file is specified as the
              filename for either <i>private-key</i> or <i>preshared-key</i>, the key
              is removed from the device. The use of <i>preshared-key</i> is
              optional, and may be omitted; it adds an additional layer
              of symmetric-key cryptography to be mixed into the already
              existing public-key cryptography, for post-quantum
              resistance.  If <i>allowed-ips</i> is specified, but the value is
              the empty string, all allowed ips are removed from the
              peer. The use of <i>persistent-keepalive</i> is optional and is
              by default off; setting it to 0 or "off" disables it.
              Otherwise it represents, in seconds, between 1 and 65535
              inclusive, how often to send an authenticated empty packet
              to the peer, for the purpose of keeping a stateful
              firewall or NAT mapping valid persistently. For example,
              if the interface very rarely sends traffic, but it might
              at anytime receive traffic from a peer, and it is behind
              NAT, the interface might benefit from having a persistent
              keepalive interval of 25 seconds; however, most users will
              not need this. The use of <i>fwmark</i> is optional and is by
              default off; setting it to 0 or "off" disables it.
              Otherwise it is a 32-bit fwmark for outgoing packets and
              may be specified in hexadecimal by prepending "0x".

       <b>setconf </b><i>&lt;interface&gt; &lt;configuration-filename&gt;</i>
              Sets the current configuration of <i>&lt;interface&gt;</i> to the
              contents of <i>&lt;configuration-filename&gt;</i>, which must be in the
              format described by <i>CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT</i> below.

       <b>addconf </b><i>&lt;interface&gt; &lt;configuration-filename&gt;</i>
              Appends the contents of <i>&lt;configuration-filename&gt;</i>, which
              must be in the format described by <i>CONFIGURATION FILE</i>
              <i>FORMAT</i> below, to the current configuration of <i>&lt;interface&gt;</i>.

       <b>syncconf </b><i>&lt;interface&gt; &lt;configuration-filename&gt;</i>
              Like <b>setconf</b>, but reads back the existing configuration
              first and only makes changes that are explicitly different
              between the configuration file and the interface. This is
              much less efficient than <b>setconf</b>, but has the benefit of
              not disrupting current peer sessions. The contents of
              <i>&lt;configuration-filename&gt;</i> must be in the format described
              by <i>CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT</i> below.

       <b>genkey </b>Generates a random <i>private</i> key in base64 and prints it to
              standard output.

       <b>genpsk </b>Generates a random <i>preshared</i> key in base64 and prints it
              to standard output.

       <b>pubkey </b>Calculates a <i>public</i> key and prints it in base64 to
              standard output from a corresponding <i>private</i> key
              (generated with <i>genkey</i>) given in base64 on standard input.

              A private key and a corresponding public key may be
              generated at once by calling:
                  $ umask 077
                  $ wg genkey | tee private.key | wg pubkey &gt; public.key

       <b>help   </b>Shows usage message.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The configuration file format is based on <i>INI</i>. There are two top
       level sections -- <i>Interface</i> and <i>Peer</i>. Multiple <i>Peer</i> sections may
       be specified, but only one <i>Interface</i> section may be specified.

       The <i>Interface</i> section may contain the following fields:

       •      PrivateKey — a base64 private key generated by <i>wg genkey</i>.
              Required.

       •      ListenPort — a 16-bit port for listening. Optional; if not
              specified, chosen randomly.

       •      FwMark — a 32-bit fwmark for outgoing packets. If set to 0
              or "off", this option is disabled. May be specified in
              hexadecimal by prepending "0x". Optional.

       The <i>Peer</i> sections may contain the following fields:

       •      PublicKey — a base64 public key calculated by <i>wg pubkey</i>
              from a private key, and usually transmitted out of band to
              the author of the configuration file. Required.

       •      PresharedKey — a base64 preshared key generated by <i>wg</i>
              <i>genpsk</i>. Optional, and may be omitted. This option adds an
              additional layer of symmetric-key cryptography to be mixed
              into the already existing public-key cryptography, for
              post-quantum resistance.

       •      AllowedIPs — a comma-separated list of IP (v4 or v6)
              addresses with CIDR masks from which incoming traffic for
              this peer is allowed and to which outgoing traffic for
              this peer is directed. The catch-all <i>0.0.0.0/0</i> may be
              specified for matching all IPv4 addresses, and <i>::/0</i> may be
              specified for matching all IPv6 addresses. May be
              specified multiple times.

       •      Endpoint — an endpoint IP or hostname, followed by a
              colon, and then a port number. This endpoint will be
              updated automatically to the most recent source IP address
              and port of correctly authenticated packets from the peer.
              Optional.

       •      PersistentKeepalive — a seconds interval, between 1 and
              65535 inclusive, of how often to send an authenticated
              empty packet to the peer for the purpose of keeping a
              stateful firewall or NAT mapping valid persistently. For
              example, if the interface very rarely sends traffic, but
              it might at anytime receive traffic from a peer, and it is
              behind NAT, the interface might benefit from having a
              persistent keepalive interval of 25 seconds. If set to 0
              or "off", this option is disabled. By default or when
              unspecified, this option is off. Most users will not need
              this. Optional.

DEBUGGING INFORMATION </h2>
<pre>
       Sometimes it is useful to have information on the current runtime
       state of a tunnel. When using the Linux kernel module on a kernel
       that supports dynamic debugging, debugging information can be
       written into <a href="../man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg(1)</a> by running as root:

           <b># modprobe wireguard &amp;&amp; echo module wireguard +p &gt;</b>
       <b>/sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control</b>

       On OpenBSD and FreeBSD, debugging information can be written into
       <a href="../man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg(1)</a> on a per-interface basis by using <b>ifconfig</b>(1):

           <b># ifconfig wg0 debug</b>

       <b>On userspace implementations, it is customary to set the</b>
       <i>LOG_LEVEL</i> <b>environment variable to </b><i>verbose</i><b>.</b>
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>WG_COLOR_MODE</i>
              If set to <i>always</i>, always print ANSI colorized output. If
              set to <i>never</i>, never print ANSI colorized output. If set to
              <i>auto</i>, something invalid, or unset, then print ANSI
              colorized output only when writing to a TTY.

       <i>WG_HIDE_KEYS</i>
              If set to <i>never</i>, then the pretty-printing <b>show </b>sub-command
              will show private and preshared keys in the output. If set
              to <i>always</i>, something invalid, or unset, then private and
              preshared keys will be printed as "(hidden)".

       <i>WG_ENDPOINT_RESOLUTION_RETRIES</i>
              If set to an integer or to <i>infinity</i>, DNS resolution for
              each peer's endpoint will be retried that many times for
              non-permanent errors, with an increasing delay between
              retries. If unset, the default is 15 retries.
