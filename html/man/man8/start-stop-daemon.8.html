NAME </h2>
<pre>
       start-stop-daemon - start and stop system daemon programs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>start-stop-daemon </b>[<i>option</i>...] <i>command</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>start-stop-daemon </b>is used to control the creation and termination
       of system-level processes.  Using one of the matching options,
       <b>start-stop-daemon </b>can be configured to find existing instances of
       a running process.

       <b>Note</b>: Unless <b>--pid </b>or <b>--pidfile </b>are specified, <b>start-stop-daemon</b>
       behaves similar to <a href="../man1/killall.1.html">killall(1)</a>.  <b>start-stop-daemon </b>will scan the
       process table looking for any processes which match the process
       name, parent pid, uid, and/or gid (if specified).  Any matching
       process will prevent <b>--start </b>from starting the daemon.  All
       matching processes will be sent the TERM signal (or the one
       specified via <b>--signal </b>or <b>--retry</b>) if <b>--stop </b>is specified.  For
       daemons which have long-lived children which need to live through
       a <b>--stop</b>, you must specify a pidfile.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-S</b>, <b>--start </b>[<b>--</b>] <i>arguments</i>
           Check for the existence of a specified process.  If such a
           process exists, <b>start-stop-daemon </b>does nothing, and exits
           with error status 1 (0 if <b>--oknodo </b>is specified).  If such a
           process does not exist, it starts an instance, using either
           the executable specified by <b>--exec </b>or, if specified, by
           <b>--startas</b>.  Any arguments given after <b>-- </b>on the command line
           are passed unmodified to the program being started.

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--stop</b>
           Checks for the existence of a specified process.  If such a
           process exists, <b>start-stop-daemon </b>sends it the signal
           specified by <b>--signal</b>, and exits with error status 0.  If
           such a process does not exist, <b>start-stop-daemon </b>exits with
           error status 1 (0 if <b>--oknodo </b>is specified).  If <b>--retry </b>is
           specified, then <b>start-stop-daemon </b>will check that the
           process(es) have terminated.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--status</b>
           Check for the existence of a specified process, and returns
           an exit status code, according to the LSB Init Script Actions
           (since version 1.16.1).

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show usage information and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Show the program version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Matching options</b>
       <b>--pid </b><i>pid</i>
           Check for a process with the specified <i>pid</i> (since version
           1.17.6).  The <i>pid</i> must be a number greater than 0.

       <b>--ppid </b><i>ppid</i>
           Check for a process with the specified parent pid <i>ppid</i> (since
           version 1.17.7).  The <i>ppid</i> must be a number greater than 0.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pidfile </b><i>pidfile</i>
           Check whether a process has created the file <i>pidfile</i>.

           <b>Note</b>: Using this matching option alone might cause unintended
           processes to be acted on, if the old process terminated
           without being able to remove the <i>pidfile</i>.

           <b>Warning</b>: Using this match option with a world-writable
           pidfile or using it alone with a daemon that writes the
           pidfile as an unprivileged (non-root) user will be refused
           with an error (since version 1.19.3) as this is a security
           risk, because either any user can write to it, or if the
           daemon gets compromised, the contents of the pidfile cannot
           be trusted, and then a privileged runner (such as an init
           script executed as root) would end up acting on any system
           process.  Using <i>/dev/null</i> is exempt from these checks.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--exec </b><i>executable</i>
           Check for processes that are instances of this <i>executable</i>.
           The <i>executable</i> argument should be an absolute pathname.

           <b>Note</b>: This might not work as intended with interpreted
           scripts, as the executable will point to the interpreter.
           Take into account processes running from inside a chroot will
           also be matched, so other match restrictions might be needed.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--name </b><i>process-name</i>
           Check for processes with the name <i>process-name</i>.  The <i>process-</i>
           <i>name</i> is usually the process filename, but it could have been
           changed by the process itself.

           <b>Note</b>: On most systems this information is retrieved from the
           process comm name from the kernel, which tends to have a
           relatively short length limit (assuming more than 15
           characters is non-portable).

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user </b><i>username</i>|<i>uid</i>
           Check for processes owned by the user specified by <i>username</i>
           or <i>uid</i>.

           <b>Note</b>: Using this matching option alone will cause all
           processes matching the user to be acted on.

   <b>Generic options</b>
       <b>-g</b>, <b>--group </b><i>group</i>|<i>gid</i>
           Change to <i>group</i> or <i>gid</i> when starting the process.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--signal </b><i>signal</i>
           With <b>--stop</b>, specifies the signal to send to processes being
           stopped (default TERM).

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--retry </b><i>timeout</i>|<i>schedule</i>
           With <b>--stop</b>, specifies that <b>start-stop-daemon </b>is to check
           whether the process(es) do finish.  It will check repeatedly
           whether any matching processes are running, until none are.
           If the processes do not exit it will then take further action
           as determined by the schedule.

           If <i>timeout</i> is specified instead of <i>schedule</i>, then the
           schedule <i>signal</i><b>/</b><i>timeout</i><b>/KILL/</b><i>timeout</i> is used, where <i>signal</i> is
           the signal specified with <b>--signal</b>.

           <i>schedule</i> is a list of at least two items separated by slashes
           (<b>/</b>); each item may be <b>-</b><i>signal-number</i> or [<b>-</b>]<i>signal-name</i>, which
           means to send that signal, or <i>timeout</i>, which means to wait
           that many seconds for processes to exit, or <b>forever</b>, which
           means to repeat the rest of the schedule forever if
           necessary.

           If the end of the schedule is reached and <b>forever </b>is not
           specified, then <b>start-stop-daemon </b>exits with error status 2.
           If a schedule is specified, then any signal specified with
           <b>--signal </b>is ignored.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--startas </b><i>pathname</i>
           With <b>--start</b>, start the process specified by <i>pathname</i>.  If
           not specified, defaults to the argument given to <b>--exec</b>.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--test</b>
           Print actions that would be taken and set appropriate return
           value, but take no action.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--oknodo</b>
           Return exit status 0 instead of 1 if no actions are (would
           be) taken.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Do not print informational messages; only display error
           messages.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--chuid </b><i>username</i>|<i>uid</i>[<b>:</b><i>group</i>|<i>gid</i>]
           Change to this username/uid before starting the process.  You
           can also specify a group by appending a <b>:</b>, then the group or
           gid in the same way as you would for the <a href="../man1/chown.1.html">chown(1)</a> command
           (<i>user</i><b>:</b><i>group</i>).  If a user is specified without a group, the
           primary GID for that user is used.  When using this option
           you must realize that the primary and supplemental groups are
           set as well, even if the <b>--group </b>option is not specified.
           The <b>--group </b>option is only for groups that the user isn't
           normally a member of (like adding per process group
           membership for generic users like <b>nobody</b>).

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--chroot </b><i>root</i>
           Change directory and chroot to <i>root</i> before starting the
           process.  Please note that the pidfile is also written after
           the chroot.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--chdir </b><i>path</i>
           Change directory to <i>path</i> before starting the process.  This
           is done after the chroot if the <b>-r</b>|<b>--chroot </b>option is set.
           When not specified, <b>start-stop-daemon </b>will change directory
           to the root directory before starting the process.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--background</b>
           Typically used with programs that don't detach on their own.
           This option will force <b>start-stop-daemon </b>to fork before
           starting the process, and force it into the background.

           <b>Warning</b>: <b>start-stop-daemon </b>cannot check the exit status if
           the process fails to execute for <b>any </b>reason.  This is a last
           resort, and is only meant for programs that either make no
           sense forking on their own, or where it's not feasible to add
           the code for them to do this themselves.

       <b>--notify-await</b>
           Wait for the background process to send a readiness
           notification before considering the service started (since
           version 1.19.3).  This implements parts of the systemd
           readiness protocol, as specified in the <a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)</a> manual
           page.  The following variables are supported:

           <b>READY=1</b>
               The program is ready to give service, so we can exit
               safely.

           <b>EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=</b><i>number</i>
               The program requests to extend the timeout by <i>number</i>
               microseconds.  This will reset the current timeout to the
               specified value.

           <b>ERRNO=</b><i>number</i>
               The program is exiting with an error.  Do the same and
               print the user-friendly string for the <b>errno </b>value.

       <b>--notify-timeout </b><i>timeout</i>
           Set a timeout for the <b>--notify-await </b>option (since version
           1.19.3).  When the timeout is reached, <b>start-stop-daemon </b>will
           exit with an error code, and no readiness notification will
           be awaited.  The default is <b>60 </b>seconds.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--no-close</b>
           Do not close any file descriptor when forcing the daemon into
           the background (since version 1.16.5).  Used for debugging
           purposes to see the process output, or to redirect file
           descriptors to log the process output.  Only relevant when
           using <b>--background</b>.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--output </b><i>pathname</i>
           Redirect <b>stdout </b>and <b>stderr </b>to <i>pathname</i> when forcing the
           daemon into the background (since version 1.20.6).  Only
           relevant when using <b>--background</b>.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--nicelevel </b><i>int</i>
           This alters the priority of the process before starting it.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--procsched </b><i>policy</i><b>:</b><i>priority</i>
           This alters the process scheduler policy and priority of the
           process before starting it (since version 1.15.0).  The
           priority can be optionally specified by appending a <b>:</b>
           followed by the value.  The default <i>priority</i> is 0.  The
           currently supported policy values are <b>other</b>, <b>fifo </b>and <b>rr</b>.

           This option might do nothing on some systems, where POSIX
           process scheduling is not supported.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--iosched </b><i>class</i><b>:</b><i>priority</i>
           This alters the IO scheduler class and priority of the
           process before starting it (since version 1.15.0).  The
           priority can be optionally specified by appending a <b>:</b>
           followed by the value.  The default <i>priority</i> is 4, unless
           <i>class</i> is <b>idle</b>, then <i>priority</i> will always be 7.  The currently
           supported values for <i>class</i> are <b>idle</b>, <b>best-effort </b>and <b>real-</b>
           <b>time</b>.

           This option might do nothing on some systems, where Linux IO
           scheduling is not supported.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--umask </b><i>mask</i>
           This sets the umask of the process before starting it (since
           version 1.13.22).

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--make-pidfile</b>
           Used when starting a program that does not create its own pid
           file.  This option will make <b>start-stop-daemon </b>create the
           file referenced with <b>--pidfile </b>and place the pid into it just
           before executing the process.  Note, the file will only be
           removed when stopping the program if <b>--remove-pidfile </b>is
           used.

           <b>Note</b>: This feature may not work in all cases.  Most notably
           when the program being executed forks from its main process.
           Because of this, it is usually only useful when combined with
           the <b>--background </b>option.

       <b>--remove-pidfile</b>
           Used when stopping a program that does not remove its own pid
           file (since version 1.17.19).  This option will make <b>start-</b>
           <b>stop-daemon </b>remove the file referenced with <b>--pidfile </b>after
           terminating the process.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print verbose informational messages.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>0   </b>The requested action was performed.  If <b>--oknodo </b>was
           specified, it's also possible that nothing had to be done.
           This can happen when <b>--start </b>was specified and a matching
           process was already running, or when <b>--stop </b>was specified and
           there were no matching processes.

       <b>1   </b>If <b>--oknodo </b>was not specified and nothing was done.

       <b>2   </b>If <b>--stop </b>and <b>--retry </b>were specified, but the end of the
           schedule was reached and the processes were still running.

       <b>3   </b>Any other error.

       When using the <b>--status </b>command, the following status codes are
       returned:

       <b>0   </b>Program is running.

       <b>1   </b>Program is not running and the pid file exists.

       <b>3   </b>Program is not running.

       <b>4   </b>Unable to determine program status.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       Start the <b>food </b>daemon, unless one is already running (a process
       named food, running as user food, with pid in food.pid):

        start-stop-daemon --start --oknodo --user food --name food \
          --pidfile /usr/local/var/run/food.pid --startas /usr/sbin/food \
          --chuid food -- --daemon

       Send <b>SIGTERM </b>to <b>food </b>and wait up to 5 seconds for it to stop:

        start-stop-daemon --stop --oknodo --user food --name food \
          --pidfile /usr/local/var/run/food.pid --retry 5

       Demonstration of a custom schedule for stopping <b>food</b>:

        start-stop-daemon --stop --oknodo --user food --name food \
          --pidfile /usr/local/var/run/food.pid --retry=TERM/30/KILL/5
