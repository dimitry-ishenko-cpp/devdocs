NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_exec - PAM module which calls an external command
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_exec.so </b>[debug] [expose_authtok] [seteuid] [quiet]
                   [quiet_log] [stdout] [log=<i>file</i>] [type=<i>type</i>] <i>command</i>
                   [<i>...</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       pam_exec is a PAM module that can be used to run an external
       command.

       The child's environment is set to the current PAM environment
       list, as returned by <a href="../man3/pam_getenvlist.3.html">pam_getenvlist(3)</a> In addition, the following
       PAM items are exported as environment variables: <i>PAM_RHOST</i>,
       <i>PAM_RUSER</i>, <i>PAM_SERVICE</i>, <i>PAM_TTY</i>, <i>PAM_USER</i> and <i>PAM_TYPE</i>, which
       contains one of the module types: <b>account</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>password</b>,
       <b>open_session </b>and <b>close_session</b>.

       Commands called by pam_exec need to be aware of that the user can
       have control over the environment.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debug</b>
           Print debug information.

       <b>expose_authtok</b>
           During authentication the calling command can read the
           password from <a href="../man3/stdin.3.html">stdin(3)</a>. Only first <i>PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE</i> bytes of
           a password are provided to the command.

       <b>log=</b><i>file</i>
           The output of the command is appended to file

       <b>type=</b><i>type</i>
           Only run the command if the module type matches the given
           type.

       <b>stdout</b>
           Per default the output of the executed command is written to
           /dev/null. With this option, the stdout output of the
           executed command is redirected to the calling application.
           It's in the responsibility of this application what happens
           with the output. The <b>log </b>option is ignored.

       <b>quiet</b>
           Per default pam_exec.so will echo the exit status of the
           external command if it fails. Specifying this option will
           suppress the message.

       <b>quiet_log</b>
           Per default pam_exec.so will log the exit status of the
           external command if it fails. Specifying this option will
           suppress the log message.

       <b>seteuid</b>
           Per default pam_exec.so will execute the external command
           with the real user ID of the calling process. Specifying this
           option means the command is run with the effective user ID.
</pre> <h2>
MODULE TYPES PROVIDED </h2>
<pre>
       All module types (<b>auth</b>, <b>account</b>, <b>password </b>and <b>session</b>) are
       provided.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_SUCCESS
           The external command was run successfully.

       PAM_BUF_ERR
           Memory buffer error.

       PAM_CONV_ERR
           The conversation method supplied by the application failed to
           obtain the username.

       PAM_INCOMPLETE
           The conversation method supplied by the application returned
           PAM_CONV_AGAIN.

       PAM_SERVICE_ERR
           No argument or a wrong number of arguments were given.

       PAM_SYSTEM_ERR
           A system error occurred or the command to execute failed.

       PAM_IGNORE
           <b>pam_setcred </b>was called, which does not execute the command.
           Or, the value given for the type= parameter did not match the
           module type.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/passwd to rebuild the NIS
       database after each local password change:

                   password optional pam_exec.so seteuid /usr/bin/make -C /var/yp

       This will execute the command

           make -C /var/yp

       with effective user ID.
