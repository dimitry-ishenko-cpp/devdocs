DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       CHOKe (CHOose and Keep for responsive flows, CHOose and Kill for
       unresponsive flows) is a classless qdisc designed to both
       identify and penalize flows that monopolize the queue. CHOKe is a
       variation of RED, and the configuration is similar to RED.
</pre> <h2>
ALGORITHM </h2>
<pre>
       Once the queue hits a certain average length, a random packet is
       drawn from the queue. If both the to-be-queued and the drawn
       packet belong to the same flow, both packets are dropped.
       Otherwise, if the queue length is still below the maximum length,
       the new packet has a configurable chance of being marked (which
       may mean dropped).  If the queue length exceeds <b>max</b>, the new
       packet will always be marked (or dropped).  If the queue length
       exceeds <b>limit</b>, the new packet is always dropped.

       The marking probability computation is the same as used by the
       RED qdisc.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
       The parameters are the same as for RED, except that RED uses
       bytes whereas choke counts packets. See <a href="tc-red.8.html">tc-red(8)</a> for a
       description.
