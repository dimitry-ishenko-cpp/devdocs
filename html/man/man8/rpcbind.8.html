NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>rpcbind </b>— universal addresses to RPC program number mapper
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>rpcbind </b>[<b>-adhiLls</b>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>rpcbind </b>utility is a server that converts RPC program numbers
       into universal addresses.  It must be running on the host to be
       able to make RPC calls on a server on that machine.

       When an RPC service is started, it tells <b>rpcbind </b>the address at
       which it is listening, and the RPC program numbers it is prepared
       to serve.  When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given
       program number, it first contacts <b>rpcbind </b>on the server machine
       to determine the address where RPC requests should be sent.

       The <b>rpcbind </b>utility should be started before any other RPC
       service.  Normally, standard RPC servers are started by port
       monitors, so <b>rpcbind </b>must be started before port monitors are
       invoked.

       When <b>rpcbind </b>is started, it checks that certain name-to-address
       translation-calls function correctly.  If they fail, the network
       configuration databases may be corrupt.  Since RPC services
       cannot function correctly in this situation, <b>rpcbind </b>reports the
       condition and terminates.

       The <b>rpcbind </b>utility can only be started by the super-user.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a      </b>When debugging (<b>-d</b>), do an abort on errors.

       <b>-d      </b>Run in debug mode.  In this mode, <b>rpcbind </b>will log
               additional information during operation, and will abort
               on certain errors if <b>-a </b>is also specified.  With this
               option, the name-to-address translation consistency
               checks are shown in detail.

       <b>-f      </b>Do not fork and become a background process.

       <b>-h      </b>Specify specific IP addresses to bind to for UDP
               requests.  This option may be specified multiple times
               and can be used to restrict the interfaces rpcbind will
               respond to.  When specifying IP addresses with <b>-h</b>,
               <b>rpcbind </b>will automatically add <b>127.0.0.1 </b>and if IPv6 is
               enabled, <b>::1 </b>to the list.  If no <b>-h </b>option is specified,
               <b>rpcbind </b>will bind to INADDR_ANY, which could lead to
               problems on a multi-homed host due to <b>rpcbind </b>returning a
               UDP packet from a different IP address than it was sent
               to.  Note that when <b>rpcbind </b>is controlled via systemd's
               socket activation, the <b>-h </b>option is ignored. In this
               case, you need to edit the <b>ListenStream </b>and <b>ListenDgram</b>
               definitions in <b>/usr/lib/systemd/system/rpcbind.socket</b>
               instead.

       <b>-i      </b>“Insecure” mode.  Allow calls to SET and UNSET from any
               host.  Normally <b>rpcbind </b>accepts these requests only from
               the loopback interface for security reasons.  This change
               is necessary for programs that were compiled with earlier
               versions of the rpc library and do not make those
               requests using the loopback interface.

       <b>-l      </b>Turn on libwrap connection logging.

       <b>-s      </b>Cause <b>rpcbind </b>to change to the user daemon as soon as
               possible.  This causes <b>rpcbind </b>to use non-privileged
               ports for outgoing connections, preventing non-privileged
               clients from using <b>rpcbind </b>to connect to services from a
               privileged port.

       <b>-w      </b>Cause <b>rpcbind </b>to do a "warm start" by read a state file
               when <b>rpcbind </b>starts up. The state file is created when
               <b>rpcbind </b>terminates.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       All RPC servers must be restarted if <b>rpcbind </b>is restarted.
