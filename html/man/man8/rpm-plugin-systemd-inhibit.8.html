NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rpm-plugin-systemd-inhibit - Plugin for the RPM Package Manager
</pre> <h2>
Description </h2>
<pre>
       This plugin for RPM prevents the system to enter shutdown, sleep
       or idle mode while there is a rpm transaction running to prevent
       system corruption that can occur if the transaction is interrupt‐
       ed by a reboot.

       This is achieved by using the inhibit DBUS interface of systemd.
       The call is roughly equivalent to executing

       <b>systemd-inhibit --mode=block --what=idle:sleep:shutdown --who=RPM</b>
       <b>--why="Transaction running"</b>

       See <a href="../man1/systemd-inhibit.1.html">systemd-inhibit(1)</a> for the details of this mechanism.

       It is strongly advised to have the plugin installed on all sys‐
       temd based systems.
</pre> <h2>
Prerequisites </h2>
<pre>
       For the plugin to work systemd has to be used as init system and
       though the DBUS system bus must be available.  If the plugin can‐
       not access the interface it gives a warning but does not stop the
       transaction.
</pre> <h2>
Configuration </h2>
<pre>
       There are currently no options for this plugin in particular.
