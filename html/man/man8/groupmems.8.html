</pre> <h2>
SETUP </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>groupmems </b>executable should be in mode 2710 as user <i>root</i> and
       in group <i>groups</i>. The system administrator can add users to group
       <i>groups</i> to allow or disallow them using the <b>groupmems </b>utility to
       manage their own group membership list.

                $ groupadd -r groups
                $ chmod 2710 groupmems
                $ chown root:groups groupmems
                $ groupmems -g groups -a gk4
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
       the behavior of this tool:

       <b>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP </b>(number)
           Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached,
           a new group entry (line) is started in /etc/group (with the
           same name, same password, and same GID).

           The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in
           the number of members in a group.

           This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of
           lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
           lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters.

           If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

           Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in
           the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable
           unless you really need it.
