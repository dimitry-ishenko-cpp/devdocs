NAME </h2>
<pre>
       vtep-ctl - utility for querying and configuring a VTEP database
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>vtep-ctl </b>[<i>options</i>] <b>-- </b>[<i>options</i>] <i>command</i> [<i>args</i>] [<b>-- </b>[<i>options</i>]
       <i>command</i> [<i>args</i>]]...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>vtep-ctl </b>program configures a VTEP database.  See <a href="../man5/vtep.5.html">vtep(5)</a> for
       comprehensive documentation of the database schema.

       <b>vtep-ctl </b>connects to an <b>ovsdb-server </b>process that maintains a
       VTEP configuration database.  Using this connection, it queries
       and possibly applies changes to the database, depending on the
       supplied commands.

       <b>vtep-ctl </b>can perform any number of commands in a single run,
       implemented as a single atomic transaction against the database.

       The <b>vtep-ctl </b>command line begins with global options (see <b>OPTIONS</b>
       below for details).  The global options are followed by one or
       more commands.  Each command should begin with <b>-- </b>by itself as a
       command-line argument, to separate it from the following
       commands.  (The <b>-- </b>before the first command is optional.)  The
       command itself starts with command-specific options, if any,
       followed by the command name and any arguments.  See <b>EXAMPLES</b>
       below for syntax examples.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options affect the behavior <b>vtep-ctl </b>as a whole.
       Some individual commands also accept their own options, which are
       given just before the command name.  If the first command on the
       command line has options, then those options must be separated
       from the global options by <b>--</b>.

       <b>--db=</b><i>server</i>
              Sets <i>server</i> as the database server that <b>vtep-ctl </b>contacts
              to query or modify configuration.  <i>server</i> may be an OVSDB
              active or passive connection method, as described in
              <a href="../man7/ovsdb.7.html">ovsdb(7)</a>.  The default is
              <b>unix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock</b>.

       <b>--no-syslog</b>
              By default, <b>vtep-ctl </b>logs its arguments and the details of
              any changes that it makes to the system log.  This option
              disables this logging.

              This option is equivalent to
              <b>--verbose=vtep_ctl:syslog:warn</b>.

       <b>--oneline</b>
              Modifies the output format so that the output for each
              command is printed on a single line.  New-line characters
              that would otherwise separate lines are printed as <b>\n</b>, and
              any instances of <b>\ </b>that would otherwise appear in the
              output are doubled.  Prints a blank line for each command
              that has no output.  This option does not affect the
              formatting of output from the <b>list </b>or <b>find </b>commands; see
              <b>Table Formatting Options </b>below.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
              Prevents <b>vtep-ctl </b>from actually modifying the database.

       <b>-t </b><i>secs</i>
       <b>--timeout=</b><i>secs</i>
              By default, or with a <i>secs</i> of <b>0</b>, <b>vtep-ctl </b>waits forever
              for a response from the database.  This option limits
              runtime to approximately <i>secs</i> seconds.  If the timeout
              expires, <b>vtep-ctl </b>will exit with a <b>SIGALRM </b>signal.  (A
              timeout would normally happen only if the database cannot
              be contacted, or if the system is overloaded.)

   <b>Table Formatting Options</b>
       These options control the format of output from the <b>list </b>and <b>find</b>
       commands.

       <b>-f </b><i>format</i>
       <b>--format=</b><i>format</i>
              Sets the type of table formatting.  The following types of
              <i>format</i> are available:

              <b>table  </b>2-D text tables with aligned columns.

              <b>list </b>(default)
                     A list with one column per line and rows separated
                     by a blank line.

              <b>html   </b>HTML tables.

              <b>csv    </b>Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.

              <b>json   </b>JSON format as defined in RFC 4627.  The output is
                     a sequence of JSON objects, each of which
                     corresponds to one table.  Each JSON object has the
                     following members with the noted values:

                     <b>caption</b>
                            The table's caption.  This member is omitted
                            if the table has no caption.

                     <b>headings</b>
                            An array with one element per table column.
                            Each array element is a string giving the
                            corresponding column's heading.

                     <b>data   </b>An array with one element per table row.
                            Each element is also an array with one
                            element per table column.  The elements of
                            this second-level array are the cells that
                            constitute the table.  Cells that represent
                            OVSDB data or data types are expressed in
                            the format described in the OVSDB
                            specification; other cells are simply
                            expressed as text strings.

       <b>-d </b><i>format</i>
       <b>--data=</b><i>format</i>
              Sets the formatting for cells within output tables unless
              the table format is set to <b>json</b>, in which case <b>json</b>
              formatting is always used when formatting cells.  The
              following types of <i>format</i> are available:

              <b>string </b>(default)
                     The simple format described in the <b>Database Values</b>
                     section of <a href="ovs-vsctl.8.html">ovs-vsctl(8)</a>.

              <b>bare   </b>The simple format with punctuation stripped off: <b>[]</b>
                     and <b>{} </b>are omitted around sets, maps, and empty
                     columns, items within sets and maps are space-
                     separated, and strings are never quoted.  This
                     format may be easier for scripts to parse.

              <b>json   </b>The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.

       <b>--no-headings</b>
              This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise
              appears in the first row of table output.

       <b>--pretty</b>
              By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as
              possible.  This option causes JSON in output to be printed
              in a more readable fashion.  Members of objects and
              elements of arrays are printed one per line, with
              indentation.

              This option does not affect JSON in tables, which is
              always printed compactly.

       <b>--bare </b>Equivalent to <b>--format=list --data=bare --no-headings</b>.

       <b>--max-column-width=</b><i>n</i>
              For table output only, limits the width of any column in
              the output to <i>n</i> columns.  Longer cell data is truncated to
              fit, as necessary.  Columns are always wide enough to
              display the column names, if the heading row is printed.

   <b>Public Key Infrastructure Options</b>
       <b>-p </b><i>privkey.pem</i>
       <b>--private-key=</b><i>privkey.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as
              <b>vtep-ctl</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       <b>-c </b><i>cert.pem</i>
       <b>--certificate=</b><i>cert.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that
              certifies the private key specified on <b>-p </b>or <b>--private-key</b>
              to be trustworthy.  The certificate must be signed by the
              certificate authority (CA) that the peer in SSL
              connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C </b><i>cacert.pem</i>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><i>cacert.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that
              <b>vtep-ctl </b>should use to verify certificates presented to it
              by SSL peers.  (This may be the same certificate that SSL
              peers use to verify the certificate specified on <b>-c </b>or
              <b>--certificate</b>, or it may be a different one, depending on
              the PKI design in use.)

       <b>-C none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL
              peers.  This introduces a security risk, because it means
              that certificates cannot be verified to be those of known
              trusted hosts.

       <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><i>cacert.pem</i>
              When <i>cacert.pem</i> exists, this option has the same effect as
              <b>-C </b>or <b>--ca-cert</b>.  If it does not exist, then <b>vtep-ctl </b>will
              attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL peer on
              its first SSL connection and save it to the named PEM
              file.  If it is successful, it will immediately drop the
              connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL
              connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed
              by the CA certificate thus obtained.

              <b>This option exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-the-</b>
              <b>middle attack obtaining the initial CA certificate</b>, but it
              may be useful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA
              certificate as part of the SSL certificate chain.  The SSL
              protocol does not require the server to send the CA
              certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C </b>and <b>--ca-cert</b>.

       <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><i>peer-cacert.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more additional
              certificates to send to SSL peers.  <i>peer-cacert.pem</i> should
              be the CA certificate used to sign <b>vtep-ctl</b>'s own
              certificate, that is, the certificate specified on <b>-c </b>or
              <b>--certificate</b>.  If <b>vtep-ctl</b>'s certificate is self-signed,
              then <b>--certificate </b>and <b>--peer-ca-cert </b>should specify the
              same file.

              This option is not useful in normal operation, because the
              SSL peer must already have the CA certificate for the peer
              to have any confidence in <b>vtep-ctl</b>'s identity.  However,
              this offers a way for a new installation to bootstrap the
              CA certificate on its first SSL connection.

       <b>-v</b>[<i>spec</i>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<i>spec</i>]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any <i>spec</i>, sets the log level
              for every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <i>spec</i>
              is a list of words separated by spaces or commas or
              colons, up to one from each category below:

              •      A valid module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b>
                     command on <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a>, limits the log level
                     change to the specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level
                     change to only to the system log, to the console,
                     or to a file, respectively.  (If <b>--detach </b>is
                     specified, <b>vtep-ctl </b>closes its standard file
                     descriptors, so logging to the console will have no
                     effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog </b>is accepted as a word
                     and is only useful along with the <b>--syslog-target</b>
                     option (the word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the
                     log level.  Messages of the given severity or
                     higher will be logged, and messages of lower
                     severity will be filtered out.  <b>off </b>filters out all
                     messages.  See <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a definition of
                     each log level.

              Case is not significant within <i>spec</i>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a
              file will not take place unless <b>--log-file </b>is also
              specified (see below).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any </b>is
              accepted as a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
              <b>--verbose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
              Sets the log pattern for <i>destination</i> to <i>pattern</i>.  Refer to
              <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a description of the valid syntax for
              <i>pattern</i>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><i>facility</i>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><i>facility</i>
              Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. <i>facility</i> can
              be one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>,
              <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>, <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>,
              <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>, <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6 </b>or <b>local7</b>.
              If this option is not specified, <b>daemon </b>is used as the
              default for the local system syslog and <b>local0 </b>is used
              while sending a message to the target provided via the
              <b>--syslog-target </b>option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
              Enables logging to a file.  If <i>file</i> is specified, then it
              is used as the exact name for the log file.  The default
              log file name used if <i>file</i> is omitted is
              <b>/usr/local/var/log/openvswitch/vtep-ctl.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><i>host</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <i>port</i> on <i>host</i>, in addition to
              the system syslog.  The <i>host</i> must be a numerical IP
              address, not a hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><i>method</i>
              Specify <i>method</i> how syslog messages should be sent to
              syslog daemon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog() </b>function.  Downside of
                     using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix
                     to every message before it is actually sent to the
                     syslog daemon over <b>/dev/log </b>UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><i>file</i>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is
                     possible to specify arbitrary message format with
                     this option.  However, <b>rsyslogd 8.9 </b>and older
                     versions use hard coded parser function anyway that
                     limits UNIX domain socket use.  If you want to use
                     arbitrary message format with older <b>rsyslogd</b>
                     versions, then use UDP socket to localhost IP
                     address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><i>ip</i>:<i>port</i>, use UDP socket.  With this method it
                     is possible to use arbitrary message format also
                     with older <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages
                     over UDP socket extra precaution needs to be taken
                     into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to
                     be configured to listen on the specified UDP port,
                     accidental iptables rules could be interfering with
                     local syslog traffic and there are some security
                     considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do
                     not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is taken from the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>
              environment variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help </b>Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The commands implemented by <b>vtep-ctl </b>are described in the
       sections below.

   <b>Physical Switch Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate physical switches.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-ps </b><i>pswitch</i>
              Creates a new physical switch named <i>pswitch</i>.  Initially
              the switch will have no ports.

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a switch that
              exists is an error.  With <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does
              nothing if <i>pswitch</i> already exists.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-ps </b><i>pswitch</i>
              Deletes <i>pswitch</i> and all of its ports.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a switch that
              does not exist is an error.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting
              to delete a switch that does not exist has no effect.

       <b>list-ps</b>
              Lists all existing physical switches on standard output,
              one per line.

       <b>ps-exists </b><i>pswitch</i>
              Tests whether <i>pswitch</i> exists.  If so, <b>vtep-ctl </b>exits
              successfully with exit code 0.  If not, <b>vtep-ctl </b>exits

   <b>Port Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate VTEP physical ports.

       <b>list-ports </b><i>pswitch</i>
              Lists all of the ports within <i>pswitch</i> on standard output,
              one per line.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-port </b><i>pswitch port</i>
              Creates on <i>pswitch</i> a new port named <i>port</i> from the network
              device of the same name.

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a port that
              exists is an error.  With <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does
              nothing if <i>port</i> already exists on <i>pswitch</i>.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-port </b>[<i>pswitch</i>] <i>port</i>
              Deletes <i>port</i>.  If <i>pswitch</i> is omitted, <i>port</i> is removed from
              whatever switch contains it; if <i>pswitch</i> is specified, it
              must be the switch that contains <i>port</i>.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a port that does
              not exist is an error.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to
              delete a port that does not exist has no effect.

   <b>Logical Switch Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate logical switches.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-ls </b><i>lswitch</i>
              Creates a new logical switch named <i>lswitch</i>.  Initially the

       <b>list-bindings </b><i>pswitch port</i>
              List the logical switch bindings for <i>port</i> on the physical
              switch <i>pswitch</i>.

       <b>set-replication-mode </b><i>lswitch replication-mode</i>
              Set logical switch <i>lswitch</i> replication mode to
              <i>replication-mode</i>; the only valid values for replication
              mode are "service_node" and "source_node".  For handling
              L2 broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic,
              packets can be sent to all members of a logical switch
              referenced by a physical switch.  There are different
              modes to replicate the packets.  The default mode of
              replication is to send the traffic to a service node,
              which can be a hypervisor, server or appliance, and let
              the service node handle replication to other transport
              nodes (hypervisors or other VTEP physical switches).  This
              mode is called service node replication.  An alternate
              mode of replication, called source node replication
              involves the source node sending to all other transport
              nodes.  Hypervisors are always responsible for doing their
              own replication for locally attached VMs in both modes.
              Service node mode is the default, if the replication mode
              is not explicitly set.  Service node replication mode is
              considered a basic requirement because it only requires
              sending the packet to a single transport node.

       <b>get-replication-mode </b><i>lswitch</i>
              Get logical switch <i>lswitch</i> replication mode.  The only
              valid values for replication mode are "service_node" and
              "source_node".  An empty reply for replication mode
              implies a default of "service_node".

   <b>Logical Router Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate logical routers.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-lr </b><i>lrouter</i>
              Creates a new logical router named <i>lrouter</i>.

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a router that

              per line.

       <b>lr-exists </b><i>lrouter</i>
              Tests whether <i>lrouter</i> exists.  If so, <b>vtep-ctl </b>exits
              successfully with exit code 0.  If not, <b>vtep-ctl </b>exits
              unsuccessfully with exit code 2.

   <b>Local MAC Binding Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate local MAC bindings for the
       logical switch.  The local maps are written by the VTEP to refer
       to MACs it has learned on its physical ports.

       <b>add-ucast-local </b><i>lswitch mac</i> [<i>encap</i>] <i>ip</i>
              Map the unicast Ethernet address <i>mac</i> to the physical
              location <i>ip</i> using encapsulation <i>encap</i> on <i>lswitch</i>.  If
              <i>encap</i> is not specified, the default is "vxlan_over_ipv4".
              The local mappings are used by the VTEP to refer to MACs
              learned on its physical ports.

       <b>del-ucast-local </b><i>lswitch mac</i>
              Remove the local unicast Ethernet address <i>mac</i> map from
              <i>lswitch</i>.  The local mappings are used by the VTEP to refer
              to MACs learned on its physical ports.

       <b>add-mcast-local </b><i>lswitch mac</i> [<i>encap</i>] <i>ip</i>
              Add physical location <i>ip</i> using encapsulation <i>encap</i> to the
              local mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address <i>mac</i>
              on <i>lswitch</i>.  If <i>encap</i> is not specified, the default is
              "vxlan_over_ipv4".  The local mappings are used by the
              VTEP to refer to MACs learned on its physical ports.

       <b>del-mcast-local </b><i>lswitch mac</i> [<i>encap</i>] <i>ip</i>

              Clear the local MAC bindings for <i>lswitch</i>.

       <b>list-local-macs </b><i>lswitch</i>
              List the local MAC bindings for <i>lswitch</i>, one per line.

   <b>Remote MAC Binding Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate local and remote MAC
       bindings for the logical switch.  The remote maps are written by
       the network virtualization controller to refer to MACs that it
       has learned.

       <b>add-ucast-remote </b><i>lswitch mac</i> [<i>encap</i>] <i>ip</i>
              Map the unicast Ethernet address <i>mac</i> to the physical
              location <i>ip</i> using encapsulation <i>encap</i> on <i>lswitch</i>.  If
              <i>encap</i> is not specified, the default is "vxlan_over_ipv4".
              The remote mappings are used by the network virtualization
              platform to refer to MACs that it has learned.

       <b>del-ucast-remote </b><i>lswitch mac</i>
              Remove the remote unicast Ethernet address <i>mac</i> map from
              <i>lswitch</i>.  The remote mappings are used by the network
              virtualization platform to refer to MACs that it has
              learned.

       <b>add-mcast-remote </b><i>lswitch mac</i> [<i>encap</i>] <i>ip</i>
              Add physical location <i>ip</i> using encapsulation <i>encap</i> to the

              <i>mac</i> on <i>lswitch</i>.  If <i>encap</i> is not specified, the default is
              "vxlan_over_ipv4".  The remote mappings are used by the
              network virtualization platform to refer to MACs that it
              has learned.

       <b>del-mcast-remote </b><i>lswitch mac</i> [<i>encap</i>] <i>ip</i>
              Remove physical location <i>ip</i> using encapsulation <i>encap</i> from
              the remote mac binding table for multicast Ethernet
              address <i>mac</i> on <i>lswitch</i>.  If <i>encap</i> is not specified, the
              default is "vxlan_over_ipv4".  The remote mappings are
              used by the network virtualization platform to refer to
              MACs that it has learned.

       <b>list-remote-macs </b><i>lswitch</i>
              List the remote MAC bindings for <i>lswitch</i>, one per line.

   <b>Manager Connectivity</b>
       These commands manipulate the <b>managers </b>column in the <b>Global </b>table
       and rows in the <b>Managers </b>table.  When <b>ovsdb-server </b>is configured
       to use the <b>managers </b>column for OVSDB connections (as described in
       the startup scripts provided with Open vSwitch), this allows the
       administrator to use <b>vtep-ctl </b>to configure database connections.

       <b>get-manager</b>
              Prints the configured manager(s).

       <b>del-manager</b>
              Deletes the configured manager(s).

       <b>set-manager </b><i>target</i>...
              Sets the configured manager target or targets.  Each
              <i>target</i> may be an OVSDB active or passive connection
              method, e.g. <b>pssl:6640</b>, as described in <a href="../man7/ovsdb.7.html">ovsdb(7)</a>.

   <b>Database Commands</b>
       These commands query and modify the contents of <b>ovsdb </b>tables.
       They are a slight abstraction of the <b>ovsdb </b>interface and as such
       they operate at a lower level than other <b>vtep-ctl </b>commands.

     <i>Identifying Tables, Records, and Columns</i>

       Each of these commands has a <i>table</i> parameter to identify a table
       within the database.  Many of them also take a <i>record</i> parameter
       that identifies a particular record within a table.  The <i>record</i>
       parameter may be the UUID for a record, and many tables offer
       additional ways to identify records.  Some commands also take
       <i>column</i> parameters that identify a particular field within the
       records in a table.

       The following tables are currently defined:

       <b>Global </b>Top-level configuration for a hardware VTEP.  This table
              contains exactly one record, identified by specifying <b>. </b>as
              the record name.

       <b>Manager</b>
              Configuration for an OVSDB connection.  Records may be
              identified by target (e.g. <b>tcp:1.2.3.4</b>).

       <b>Physical_Switch</b>
              A physical switch that implements a VTEP.  Records may be
              identified by physical switch name.

       <b>Physical_Port</b>
              A port within a physical switch.

       <b>Logical_Binding_Stats</b>
              Reports statistics for the logical switch with which a
              VLAN on a physical port is associated.

       <b>Logical_Switch</b>
              A logical Ethernet switch.  Records may be identified by
              logical switch name.

       <b>Ucast_Macs_Local</b>
              Mapping of locally discovered unicast MAC addresses to
              tunnels.

       <b>Ucast_Macs_Remote</b>
              Mapping of remotely programmed unicast MAC addresses to
              tunnels.

       <b>Mcast_Macs_Local</b>
              Mapping of locally discovered multicast MAC addresses to
              tunnels.

       <b>Mcast_Macs_Remote</b>
              Mapping of remotely programmed multicast MAC addresses to
              tunnels.

       <b>Physical_Locator_Set</b>
              A set of one or more physical locators.

       <b>Physical_Locator</b>
              Identifies an endpoint to which logical switch traffic may
              be encapsulated and forwarded.  Records may be identified
              by physical locator name.

       Record names must be specified in full and with correct
       capitalization, except that UUIDs may be abbreviated to their
       first 4 (or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique within
       the table.  Names of tables and columns are not case-sensitive,
       and <b>- </b>and <b>_ </b>are treated interchangeably.  Unique abbreviations of
       table and column names are acceptable, e.g. <b>man </b>or <b>m </b>is
       sufficient to identify the <b>Manager </b>table.

     <i>Database Values</i>

       Each column in the database accepts a fixed type of data.  The
       currently defined basic types, and their representations, are:

       integer
              A decimal integer in the range -2**63 to 2**63-1,
              inclusive.

       real   A floating-point number.

       Boolean
              True or false, written <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>, respectively.

       string An arbitrary Unicode string, except that null bytes are
              not allowed.  Quotes are optional for most strings that
              begin with an English letter or underscore and consist
              only of letters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
              However, <b>true </b>and <b>false </b>and strings that match the syntax
              of UUIDs (see below) must be enclosed in double quotes to
              distinguish them from other basic types.  When double
              quotes are used, the syntax is that of strings in JSON,
              e.g. backslashes may be used to escape special characters.
              The empty string must be represented as a pair of double
              quotes (<b>""</b>).

       UUID   Either a universally unique identifier in the style of RFC
              4122, e.g. <b>f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</b>, or an
              <b>@</b><i>name</i> defined by a <b>get </b>or <b>create </b>command within the same
              <b>vtep-ctl </b>invocation.

       Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or
       a single comma.  When multiple values are present, duplicates are
       not allowed, and order is not important.  Conversely, some
       database columns can have an empty set of values, represented as
       <b>[]</b>, and square brackets may optionally enclose other non-empty
       sets or single values as well. For a column accepting a set of
       integers, database commands accept a range. A range is
       represented by two integers separated by <b>-</b>. A range is inclusive.
       A range has a maximum size of 4096 elements. If more elements are
       needed, they can be specified in separate ranges.

       A few database columns are ``maps'' of key-value pairs, where the
       key and the value are each some fixed database type.  These are
       specified in the form <i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>, where <i>key</i> and <i>value</i> follow the
       syntax for the column's key type and value type, respectively.
       When multiple pairs are present (separated by spaces or a comma),
       duplicate keys are not allowed, and again the order is not
       important.  Duplicate values are allowed.  An empty map is
       represented as <b>{}</b>.  Curly braces may optionally enclose non-empty
       maps as well (but use quotes to prevent the shell from expanding
       <b>other-config={0=x,1=y} </b>into <b>other-config=0=x other-config=1=y</b>,
       which may not have the desired effect).

     <i>Database Command Syntax</i>

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--columns=</b><i>column</i>[<b>,</b><i>column</i>]...] <b>list </b><i>table</i>
       [<i>record</i>]...
              Lists the data in each specified <i>record</i>.  If no records
              are specified, lists all the records in <i>table</i>.

              If <b>--columns </b>is specified, only the requested columns are
              listed, in the specified order.  Otherwise, all columns
              are listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if any specified
              <i>record</i> does not exist.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, the command
              ignores any <i>record</i> that does not exist, without producing
              any output.

       [<b>--columns=</b><i>column</i>[<b>,</b><i>column</i>]...] <b>find </b><i>table</i> [<i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]<b>=</b><i>value</i>]...
              Lists the data in each record in <i>table</i> whose <i>column</i> equals
              <i>value</i> or, if <i>key</i> is specified, whose <i>column</i> contains a <i>key</i>
              with the specified <i>value</i>.  The following operators may be
              used where <b>= </b>is written in the syntax summary:

              <b>= != &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=</b>
                     Selects records in which <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] equals, does
                     not equal, is less than, is greater than, is less
                     than or equal to, or is greater than or equal to
                     <i>value</i>, respectively.

                     Consider <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] and <i>value</i> as sets of
                     elements.  Identical sets are considered equal.
                     Otherwise, if the sets have different numbers of
                     elements, then the set with more elements is
                     considered to be larger.  Otherwise, consider a
                     element from each set pairwise, in increasing order
                     within each set.  The first pair that differs
                     determines the result.  (For a column that contains
                     key-value pairs, first all the keys are compared,
                     and values are considered only if the two sets
                     contain identical keys.)

              <b>{=} {!=}</b>
                     Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.

              <b>{&lt;=}   </b>Selects records in which <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] is a subset
                     of <i>value</i>.  For example, <b>flood-vlans{&lt;=}1,2 </b>selects
                     records in which the <b>flood-vlans </b>column is the
                     empty set or contains 1 or 2 or both.

              <b>{&lt;}    </b>Selects records in which <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] is a proper
                     subset of <i>value</i>.  For example, <b>flood-vlans{&lt;}1,2</b>
                     selects records in which the <b>flood-vlans </b>column is
                     the empty set or contains 1 or 2 but not both.

              <b>{&gt;=} {&gt;}</b>
                     Same as <b>{&lt;=} </b>and <b>{&lt;}</b>, respectively, except that the
                     relationship is reversed.  For example, <b>flood-</b>
                     <b>vlans{&gt;=}1,2 </b>selects records in which the <b>flood-</b>
                     <b>vlans </b>column contains both 1 and 2.

              The following operators are available only in Open vSwitch
              2.16 and later:

              <b>{in}   </b>Selects records in which every element in
                     <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] is also in <i>value</i>.  (This is the same
                     as <b>{&lt;=}</b>.)

              <b>{not-in}</b>
                     Selects records in which every element in
                     <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>] is not in <i>value</i>.

              For arithmetic operators (<b>= != &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=</b>), when <i>key</i> is
              specified but a particular record's <i>column</i> does not
              contain <i>key</i>, the record is always omitted from the
              results.  Thus, the condition <b>other-config:mtu!=1500</b>
              matches records that have a <b>mtu </b>key whose value is not
              1500, but not those that lack an <b>mtu </b>key.

              For the set operators, when <i>key</i> is specified but a
              particular record's <i>column</i> does not contain <i>key</i>, the
              comparison is done against an empty set.  Thus, the
              condition <b>other-config:mtu{!=}1500 </b>matches records that
              have a <b>mtu </b>key whose value is not 1500 and those that lack
              an <b>mtu </b>key.

              Don't forget to escape <b>&lt; </b>or <b>&gt; </b>from interpretation by the
              shell.

              If <b>--columns </b>is specified, only the requested columns are
              listed, in the specified order.  Otherwise all columns are
              listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

              The UUIDs shown for rows created in the same <b>vtep-ctl</b>
              invocation will be wrong.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--id=@</b><i>name</i>] <b>get </b><i>table record</i> [<i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]]...
              Prints the value of each specified <i>column</i> in the given
              <i>record</i> in <i>table</i>.  For map columns, a <i>key</i> may optionally be
              specified, in which case the value associated with <i>key</i> in
              the column is printed, instead of the entire map.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <i>record</i> does not
              exist or <i>key</i> is specified, if <i>key</i> does not exist in
              <i>record</i>.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, a missing <i>record</i> yields no
              output and a missing <i>key</i> prints a blank line.

              If <b>@</b><i>name</i> is specified, then the UUID for <i>record</i> may be
              referred to by that name later in the same <b>vtep-ctl</b>
              invocation in contexts where a UUID is expected.

              Both <b>--id </b>and the <i>column</i> arguments are optional, but
              usually at least one or the other should be specified.  If
              both are omitted, then <b>get </b>has no effect except to verify
              that <i>record</i> exists in <i>table</i>.

              <b>--id </b>and <b>--if-exists </b>cannot be used together.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>set </b><i>table record column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]<b>=</b><i>value</i>...
              Sets the value of each specified <i>column</i> in the given
              <i>record</i> in <i>table</i> to <i>value</i>.  For map columns, a <i>key</i> may
              optionally be specified, in which case the value
              associated with <i>key</i> in that column is changed (or added,
              if none exists), instead of the entire map.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <i>record</i> does not
              exist.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does nothing if
              <i>record</i> does not exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>add </b><i>table record column</i> [<i>key</i><b>=</b>]<i>value</i>...
              Adds the specified value or key-value pair to <i>column</i> in
              <i>record</i> in <i>table</i>.  If <i>column</i> is a map, then <i>key</i> is
              required, otherwise it is prohibited.  If <i>key</i> already
              exists in a map column, then the current <i>value</i> is not
              replaced (use the <b>set </b>command to replace an existing
              value).

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <i>record</i> does not
              exist.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does nothing if
              <i>record</i> does not exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove </b><i>table record column value</i>...
       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove </b><i>table record column key</i>...
       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove </b><i>table record column key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>...
              Removes the specified values or key-value pairs from
              <i>column</i> in <i>record</i> in <i>table</i>.  The first form applies to
              columns that are not maps: each specified <i>value</i> is removed
              from the column.  The second and third forms apply to map
              columns: if only a <i>key</i> is specified, then any key-value
              pair with the given <i>key</i> is removed, regardless of its
              value; if a <i>value</i> is given then a pair is removed only if
              both key and value match.

              It is not an error if the column does not contain the
              specified key or value or pair.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <i>record</i> does not
              exist.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does nothing if
              <i>record</i> does not exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>clear </b><i>table record column</i>...
              Sets each <i>column</i> in <i>record</i> in <i>table</i> to the empty set or
              empty map, as appropriate.  This command applies only to
              columns that are allowed to be empty.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <i>record</i> does not
              exist.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does nothing if
              <i>record</i> does not exist.

       [<b>--id=(@</b><i>name</i> | <i>uuid</i>] <b>create </b><i>table column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]<b>=</b><i>value</i>...
              Creates a new record in <i>table</i> and sets the initial values
              of each <i>column</i>.  Columns not explicitly set will receive
              their default values.  Outputs the UUID of the new row.

              If <b>@</b><i>name</i> is specified, then the UUID for the new row may
              be referred to by that name elsewhere in the same <b>vtep-ctl</b>
              invocation in contexts where a UUID is expected.  Such
              references may precede or follow the <b>create </b>command.

              If a valid <i>uuid</i> is specified, then it is used as the UUID
              of the new row.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     Records in the Open vSwitch database are
                     significant only when they can be reached directly
                     or indirectly from the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table.  Except
                     for records in the <b>QoS </b>or <b>Queue </b>tables, records
                     that are not reachable from the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table
                     are automatically deleted from the database.  This
                     deletion happens immediately, without waiting for
                     additional <b>ovs-vsctl </b>commands or other database
                     activity.  Thus, a <b>create </b>command must generally be
                     accompanied by additional commands <i>within the same</i>
                     <b>ovs-vsctl </b><i>invocation</i> to add a chain of references
                     to the newly created record from the top-level
                     <b>Open_vSwitch </b>record.  The <b>EXAMPLES </b>section gives
                     some examples that show how to do this.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>destroy </b><i>table record</i>...
              Deletes each specified <i>record</i> from <i>table</i>.  Unless
              <b>--if-exists </b>is specified, each <i>record</i>s must exist.

       <b>--all destroy </b><i>table</i>
              Deletes all records from the <i>table</i>.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     The <b>destroy </b>command is only useful for records in
                     the <b>QoS </b>or <b>Queue </b>tables.  Records in other tables
                     are automatically deleted from the database when
                     they become unreachable from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b>
                     table.  This means that deleting the last reference
                     to a record is sufficient for deleting the record
                     itself.  For records in these tables, <b>destroy </b>is
                     silently ignored.  See the <b>EXAMPLES </b>section below
                     for more information.

       <b>wait-until </b><i>table record</i> [<i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]<b>=</b><i>value</i>]...
              Waits until <i>table</i> contains a record named <i>record</i> whose
              <i>column</i> equals <i>value</i> or, if <i>key</i> is specified, whose <i>column</i>
              contains a <i>key</i> with the specified <i>value</i>.  This command
              supports the same operators and semantics described for
              the <b>find </b>command above.

              If no <i>column</i>[<b>:</b><i>key</i>]<b>=</b><i>value</i> arguments are given, this command
              waits only until <i>record</i> exists.  If more than one such
              argument is given, the command waits until all of them are
              satisfied.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     Usually <b>wait-until </b>should be placed at the
                     beginning of a set of <b>ovs-vsctl </b>commands.  For
                     example, <b>wait-until bridge br0 -- get bridge br0</b>
                     <b>datapath_id </b>waits until a bridge named <b>br0 </b>is
                     created, then prints its <b>datapath_id </b>column,
                     whereas <b>get bridge br0 datapath_id -- wait-until</b>
                     <b>bridge br0 </b>will abort if no bridge named <b>br0 </b>exists
                     when <b>ovs-vsctl </b>initially connects to the database.

              Consider specifying <b>--timeout=0 </b>along with <b>--wait-until</b>,
              to prevent <b>vtep-ctl </b>from terminating after waiting only at
              most 5 seconds.

       <b>comment </b>[<i>arg</i>]...
              This command has no effect on behavior, but any database
              log record created by the command will include the command
              and its arguments.
