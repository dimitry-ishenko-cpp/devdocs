       nfsidmap - The NFS idmapper upcall program

       <b>nfsidmap [-v] [-t timeout] key desc</b>
       <b>nfsidmap [-v] [-c]</b>
       <b>nfsidmap [-v] [-u|-g|-r user]</b>

       <b>nfsidmap -h</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The NFSv4 protocol represents the local system's UID and GID
       values on the wire as strings of the form <i>user@domain</i>.  The
       process of translating from UID to string and string to UID is
       referred to as "ID mapping."

       The system derives the <i>user</i> part of the string by performing a
       password or group lookup.  The lookup mechanism is configured in
       <i>/etc/idmapd.conf</i>.

       By default, the <i>domain</i> part of the string is the system's DNS
       domain name.  It can also be specified in <i>/etc/idmapd.conf</i> if the
       system is multi-homed, or if the system's DNS domain name does
       not match the name of the system's Kerberos realm.

       When the domain is not specified in <i>/etc/idmapd.conf</i> the local
       DNS server will be queried for the <i>_nfsv4idmapdomain</i> text record.
       If the record exists that will be used as the domain. When the
       record does not exist, the domain part of the DNS domain will
       used.

       The <i>/usr/sbin/nfsidmap</i> program performs translations on behalf of
       the kernel.  The kernel uses the request-key mechanism to perform
       an upcall.  <i>/usr/sbin/nfsidmap</i> is invoked by /sbin/request-key,
       performs the translation, and initializes a key with the
       resulting information.  The kernel then caches the translation
       results in the key.

       <i>nfsidmap</i> can also clear cached ID map results in the kernel, or
       revoke one particular key.  An incorrect cached key can result in
       file and directory ownership reverting to "nobody" on NFSv4 mount
       points.

       In addition, the <b>-d </b>and <b>-l </b>options are available to help diagnose
       misconfigurations.  They have no effect on the keyring containing
       ID mapping results.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-c     </b>Clear the keyring of all the keys.

       <b>-d     </b>Display the system's effective NFSv4 domain name on
              <i>stdout</i>.

       <b>-g user</b>
              Revoke the gid key of the given user.

       <b>-h     </b>Display usage message.

       <b>-l     </b>Display on <i>stdout</i> all keys currently in the keyring used
              to cache ID mapping results.  These keys are visible only
              to the superuser.

       <b>-r user</b>
              Revoke both the uid and gid key of the given user.

       <b>-t timeout</b>
              Set the expiration timer, in seconds, on the key.  The
              default is 600 seconds (10 mins).

       <b>-u user</b>
              Revoke the uid key of the given user.

       <b>-v     </b>Increases the verbosity of the output to syslog (can be
              specified multiple times).
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURING </h2>
<pre>
       The file <i>/etc/request-key.conf</i> will need to be modified so
       <i>/sbin/request-key</i> can properly direct the upcall. The following
       line should be added before a call to keyctl negate:

       create    id_resolver    *    *    /usr/sbin/nfsidmap -t 600 %k
       %d

       This will direct all id_resolver requests to the program
       <i>/usr/sbin/nfsidmap.</i>  The <b>-t 600 </b>defines how many seconds into the
       future the key will expire.  This is an optional parameter for
       <i>/usr/sbin/nfsidmap</i> and will default to 600 seconds when not
       specified.

       The idmapper system uses four key descriptions:

              uid: Find the UID for the given user
              gid: Find the GID for the given group
             user: Find the user name for the given UID
            group: Find the group name for the given GID

       You can choose to handle any of these individually, rather than
       using the generic upcall program.  If you would like to use your
       own program for a uid lookup then you would edit your request-
       key.conf so it looks similar to this:

       create    id_resolver    uid:*     *    /some/other/program %k %d
       create    id_resolver    *         *    /usr/sbin/nfsidmap %k %d

       Notice that the new line was added above the line for the generic
       program.  request-key will find the first matching line and run
       the corresponding program.  In this case, /some/other/program
       will handle all uid lookups, and /usr/sbin/nfsidmap will handle
       gid, user, and group lookups.
