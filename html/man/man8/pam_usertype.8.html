NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_usertype - check if the authenticated user is a system or
       regular account
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_usertype.so </b>[<i>flag</i>...] {<i>condition</i>}
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       pam_usertype.so is designed to succeed or fail authentication
       based on type of the account of the authenticated user. The type
       of the account is decided with help of <i>SYS_UID_MAX</i> settings in
       <i>/etc/login.defs</i>. One use is to select whether to load other
       modules based on this test.

       The module should be given only one condition as module argument.
       Authentication will succeed only if the condition is met.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following <i>flag</i>s are supported:

       <b>use_uid</b>
           Evaluate conditions using the account of the user whose UID
           the application is running under instead of the user being
           authenticated.

       <b>audit</b>
           Log unknown users to the system log.

       Available <i>condition</i>s are:

       <b>issystem</b>
           Succeed if the user is a system user.
