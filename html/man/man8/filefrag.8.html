NAME </h2>
<pre>
       filefrag - report on file fragmentation
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>filefrag </b>[ <b>-b</b><i>blocksize</i> ] [ <b>-BeEkPsvVxX </b>] [ <i>files...</i>  ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>filefrag </b>reports on how badly fragmented a particular file might
       be.  It makes allowances for indirect blocks for ext2 and ext3
       file systems, but can be used on files for any file system.

       The <b>filefrag </b>program initially attempts to get the extent
       information using FIEMAP ioctl which is more efficient and
       faster.  If FIEMAP is not supported then filefrag will fall back
       to using FIBMAP.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-B     </b>Force the use of the older FIBMAP ioctl instead of the
              FIEMAP ioctl for testing purposes.

       <b>-b</b><i>blocksize</i>
              Use <i>blocksize</i> in bytes, or with [KMG] suffix, up to 1GB
              for output instead of the file system blocksize.  For
              compatibility with earlier versions of <b>filefrag</b>, if
              <i>blocksize</i> is unspecified it defaults to 1024 bytes.  Since
              <i>blocksize</i> is an optional argument, it must be added
              without any space after <b>-b</b>.

       <b>-e     </b>Print output in extent format, even for block-mapped
              files.

       <b>-E     </b>Display the contents of ext4's extent status cache.  This
              feature is not supported on all kernels, and is only
              supported on ext4 file systems.

       <b>-k     </b>Use 1024-byte blocksize for output (identical to
              '-b1024').

       <b>-P     </b>Pre-load the ext4 extent status cache for the file.  This
              is not supported on all kernels, and is only supported on
              ext4 file systems.

       <b>-s     </b>Sync the file before requesting the mapping.

       <b>-v     </b>Be verbose when checking for file fragmentation.

       <b>-V     </b>Print version number of program and library.  If given
              twice, also print the FIEMAP flags that are understood by
              the current version.

       <b>-x     </b>Display mapping of extended attributes.

       <b>-X     </b>Display extent block numbers in hexadecimal format.
