NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_time - PAM module for time control access
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_time.so </b>[conffile=conf-file] [debug] [noaudit]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_time PAM module does not authenticate the user, but
       instead it restricts access to a system and or specific
       applications at various times of the day and on specific days or
       over various terminal lines. This module can be configured to
       deny access to (individual) users based on their name, the time
       of day, the day of week, the service they are applying for and
       their terminal from which they are making their request.

       By default rules for time/port access are taken from config file
       /etc/security/time.conf. An alternative file can be specified
       with the <i>conffile</i> option.

       If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will
       report when it denies access.
</pre> <h2>
