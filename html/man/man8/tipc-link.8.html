</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Options (flags) that can be passed anywhere in the command chain.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show help about last valid command. For example <b>tipc link</b>
              <b>--help </b>will show link help and <b>tipc --help </b>will show
              general help. The position of the option in the string is
              irrelevant.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>-json</b>
              Output results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

       <b>-p</b>, <b>-pretty</b>
              The default JSON format is compact and more efficient to
              parse but hard for most users to read.  This flag adds
              indentation for readability.

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Link statistics</b>
       <b>ACTIVE </b>link state
              An <b>ACTIVE </b>link is serving traffic. Two links to the same
              node can become <b>ACTIVE </b>if they have the same link
              <b>priority</b>.  If there is more than two links with the same
              priority the additional links will be put in <b>STANDBY</b>
              state.

       <b>STANDBY </b>link state
              A <b>STANDBY </b>link has lower link priority than an <b>ACTIVE</b>
              link. A <b>STANDBY </b>link has control traffic flowing and is
              ready to take over should the <b>ACTIVE </b>link(s) go down.

       <b>MTU</b>
              The Maximum Transmission Unit. The two endpoints advertise
              their default or configured <b>MTU </b>at initial link setup and
              will agree to use the lower of the two values should they
              differ.

       <b>Packets</b>
              The total amount of transmitted or received TIPC packets
              on a link. Including <b>fragmented </b>and <b>bundled </b>packets.

       <b>Fragments</b>
              Represented in the form <b>fragments</b>/<b>fragmented</b>.  Where
              <b>fragmented </b>is the amount of data messages which have been
              broken into <b>fragments</b>.  Subsequently the <b>fragments </b>are the
              total amount of packets that the <b>fragmented </b>messages has
              been broken into.

       <b>Bundles</b>
              Represented in the form <b>bundles</b>/<b>bundled</b>.  If a link
              becomes congested the link will attempt to bundle data
              from small <b>bundled </b>packets into <b>bundles </b>of full MTU size
              packets before they are transmitted.

       <b>Profile</b>
              Shows the <b>average </b>packet size in octets/bytes for a <b>sample</b>
              of packets. It also shows the packet size distribution of
              the <b>sampled </b>packets in the intervals

              0-64 bytes
              64-256 bytes
              256-1024 bytes
              1024-4096 bytes
              4096-16384 bytes
              16384-32768 bytes
              32768-66000 bytes

       <b>Message counters</b>

              <b>states </b>- Number of link state messages

              <b>probes </b>- Link state messages with probe flag set.
              Typically sent when a link is idle

              <b>nacks </b>- Number of negative acknowledgement (NACK) packets
              sent and received by the link

              <b>defs </b>- Number of packets received out of order

              <b>dups </b>- Number of duplicate packets received

       <b>Congestion link</b>
              The number of times an application has tried to send data
              when the TIPC link was congested

       <b>Send queue</b>
              <b>Max </b>is the maximum amount of messages that has resided in
              the out queue during the statistics collection period of a
              link.

              <b>Avg </b>is the average outqueue size during the lifetime of a
              link.

   <b>Link properties</b>
       <b>priority</b>
              The priority between logical TIPC links to a particular
              node. Link priority can range from 0 (lowest) to 31
              (highest).

       <b>tolerance</b>
              Link tolerance specifies the maximum time in milliseconds
              that TIPC will allow a communication problem to exist
              before taking the link down. The default value is 1500
              milliseconds.

       <b>window</b>
              The link window controls how many unacknowledged messages
              a link endpoint can have in its transmit queue before
              TIPC's congestion control mechanism is activated.

   <b>Monitor properties</b>
       <b>threshold</b>
              The threshold specifies the cluster size exceeding which
              the link monitoring algorithm will switch from "full-mesh"
              to "overlapping-ring".  If set of 0 the overlapping-ring
              monitoring is always on and if set to a value larger than
              anticipated cluster size the overlapping-ring is disabled.
              The default value is 32.

   <b>Monitor information</b>
       <b>table_generation</b>
              Represents the event count in a node's local monitoring
              list. It steps every time something changes in the local
              monitor list, including changes in the local domain.

       <b>cluster_size</b>
              Represents the current count of cluster members.

       <b>algorithm</b>
              The current supervision algorithm used for neighbour
              monitoring for the bearer.  Possible values are full-mesh
              or overlapping-ring.

       <b>status</b>
              The node status derived by the local node.  Possible
              status are up or down.

       <b>monitored</b>
              Represent the type of monitoring chosen by the local node.
              Possible values are direct or indirect.

       <b>generation</b>
              Represents the domain generation which is the event count
              in a node's local domain. Every time something changes
              (peer add/remove/up/down) the domain generation is stepped
              and a new version of node record is sent to inform the
              neighbors about this change. The domain generation helps
              the receiver of a domain record to know if it should
              ignore or process the record.

       <b>applied_node_status</b>
              The node status reported by the peer node for the
              succeeding peers in the node list. The Node list is a
              circular list of ascending addresses starting with the
              local node.  Possible status are: U or D. The status U
              implies up and D down.

       <b>[non_applied_node:status]</b>
              Represents the nodes and their status as reported by the
              peer node.  These nodes were not applied to the monitoring
              list for this peer node.  They are usually transient and
              occur during the cluster startup phase or network
              reconfiguration.  Possible status are: U or D. The status
              U implies up and D down.

   <b>Broadcast properties</b>
       <b>BROADCAST</b>
              Forces all multicast traffic to be transmitted via
              broadcast only, irrespective of cluster size and number of
              destinations.

       <b>REPLICAST</b>
              Forces all multicast traffic to be transmitted via
              replicast only, irrespective of cluster size and number of
              destinations.

       <b>AUTOSELECT</b>
              Auto switching to broadcast or replicast depending on
              cluster size and destination node number.

       <b>ratio SIZE</b>
              Set the AUTOSELECT criteria, percentage of destination
              nodes vs cluster size.
