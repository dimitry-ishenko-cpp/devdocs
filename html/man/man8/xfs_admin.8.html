NAME </h2>
<pre>
       xfs_admin - change parameters of an XFS filesystem
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_admin </b>[ <b>-eflpu </b>] [ <b>-O </b><i>featurelist</i> ] [ <b>-c 0</b>|<b>1 </b>] [ <b>-L </b><i>label</i> ] [
       <b>-U </b><i>uuid</i> ] [ <b>-r </b><i>rtdev</i> ] <i>device</i> [ <i>logdev</i> ]
       <b>xfs_admin -V</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_admin </b>uses the <a href="xfs_db.8.html">xfs_db(8)</a> command to modify various parameters
       of a filesystem.

       Devices that are mounted cannot be modified.  Administrators must
       unmount filesystems before <b>xfs_admin </b>or <a href="xfs_db.8.html">xfs_db(8)</a> can convert
       parameters.  A number of parameters of a mounted filesystem can
       be examined and modified using the <a href="xfs_growfs.8.html">xfs_growfs(8)</a> command.

       The optional <b>logdev </b>parameter specifies the device special file
       where the filesystem's external log resides.  This is required
       only for filesystems that use an external log.  See the <b>mkfs.xfs</b>
       <b>-l </b>option, and refer to <a href="../man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a> for a detailed description of the
       XFS log.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-e     </b>Enables unwritten extent support on a filesystem that does
              not already have this enabled (for legacy filesystems, it
              can't be disabled anymore at mkfs time).

              This option only applies to the deprecated V4 format.

       <b>-f     </b>Specifies that the filesystem image to be processed is
              stored in a regular file at <i>device</i> (see the <b>mkfs.xfs -d</b>
              <i>file</i> option).

       <b>-j     </b>Enables version 2 log format (journal format supporting
              larger log buffers).

              This option only applies to the deprecated V4 format.

       <b>-l     </b>Print the current filesystem label.

       <b>-p     </b>Enable 32bit project identifier support (PROJID32BIT
              feature).

              This option only applies to the deprecated V4 format.

       <b>-u     </b>Print the current filesystem UUID (Universally Unique
              IDentifier).

       <b>-c 0</b>|<b>1 </b>Enable (1) or disable (0) lazy-counters in the filesystem.

              Lazy-counters may not be disabled on Version 5 superblock
              filesystems (i.e. those with metadata CRCs enabled).

              In other words, this option only applies to the deprecated
              V4 format.

              This operation may take quite a bit of time on large
              filesystems as the entire filesystem needs to be scanned
              when this option is changed.

              With lazy-counters enabled, the superblock is not modified
              or logged on every change of the free-space and inode
              counters. Instead, enough information is kept in other
              parts of the filesystem to be able to maintain the counter
              values without needing to keep them in the superblock.
              This gives significant improvements in performance on some
              configurations and metadata intensive workloads.

       <b>-L </b><i>label</i>
              Set the filesystem label to <i>label</i>.  XFS filesystem labels
              can be at most 12 characters long; if <i>label</i> is longer than
              12 characters, <b>xfs_admin </b>will truncate it and print a
              warning message.  The filesystem label can be cleared
              using the special "<b>--</b>" value for <i>label</i>.

       <b>-O </b><i>feature1</i><b>=</b><i>status</i><b>,</b><i>feature2</i><b>=</b><i>status...</i>
              Add or remove features on an existing V5 filesystem.  The
              features should be specified as a comma-separated list.
              <i>status</i> should be either 0 to disable the feature or 1 to
              enable the feature.  Note, however, that most features
              cannot be disabled.

              <b>NOTE: </b>Administrators must ensure the filesystem is clean
              by running <b>xfs_repair -n </b>to inspect the filesystem before
              performing the upgrade.  If corruption is found, recovery
              procedures (e.g. reformat followed by restoration from
              backup; or running <b>xfs_repair </b>without the <b>-n</b>) must be
              followed to clean the filesystem.

              Supported features are as follows:

              <b>inobtcount</b>
                  Keep a count the number of blocks in each inode btree
                  in the AGI.  This reduces mount time by speeding up
                  metadata space reservation calculations.  The
                  filesystem cannot be downgraded after this feature is
                  enabled.  Once enabled, the filesystem will not be
                  writable by older kernels.  This feature was added to
                  Linux 5.10.

              <b>bigtime</b>
                  Upgrade a filesystem to support larger timestamps up
                  to the year 2486.  The filesystem cannot be downgraded
                  after this feature is enabled.  Once enabled, the
                  filesystem will not be mountable by older kernels.
                  This feature was added to Linux 5.10.

              <b>nrext64</b>
                  Upgrade a filesystem to support large per-inode extent
                  counters. The maximum data fork extent count will be
                  2^48 - 1, while the maximum attribute fork extent
                  count will be 2^32 - 1. The filesystem cannot be
                  downgraded after this feature is enabled. Once
                  enabled, the filesystem will not be mountable by older
                  kernels.  This feature was added to Linux 5.19.

       <b>-U </b><i>uuid</i>
              Set the UUID of the filesystem to <i>uuid</i>.  A sample UUID
              looks like this: "c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16".
              The <i>uuid</i> may also be <b>nil</b>, which will set the filesystem
              UUID to the null UUID.  The <i>uuid</i> may also be <b>generate</b>,
              which will generate a new UUID for the filesystem.  Note
              that on CRC-enabled filesystems, this will set an
              incompatible flag such that older kernels will not be able
              to mount the filesystem.  To remove this incompatible
              flag, use <b>restore</b>, which will restore the original UUID
              and remove the incompatible feature flag as needed.

       <b>-r </b><i>rtdev</i>
              Specifies the device special file where the filesystem's
              realtime section resides.  Only for those filesystems
              which use a realtime section.

       <b>-V     </b>Prints the version number and exits.

       The <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> manual entry describes how to mount a filesystem
       using its label or UUID, rather than its block special device
       name.
