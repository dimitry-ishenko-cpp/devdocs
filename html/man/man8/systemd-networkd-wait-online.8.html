NAME </h2>

SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-networkd-wait-online.service

       systemd-networkd-wait-online@.service

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>is a oneshot system service (see
       <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>), that waits for the network to be configured.
       By default, it will wait for all links it is aware of and which
       are managed by <a href="systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a> to be fully configured
       or failed, and for at least one link to be online. Here, online
       means that the link's operational state is equal or higher than
       "degraded". The threshold can be configured by
       <b>--operational-state= </b>option.

       The service systemd-networkd-wait-online.service invokes
       <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>without any options. Thus, it waits
       for all managed interfaces to be configured or failed, and for at
       least one to be online.

       The service systemd-networkd-wait-online@.service takes an
       interface name, and invokes <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>with <b>-i</b>
       and the specified interface name. Thus, wait for the specified
       interface to be configured and online. For example,
       systemd-networkd-wait-online@eth0.service waits for eth0 to be
       configured by <b>systemd-networkd </b>and online.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-i </b><i>INTERFACE</i>[:<i>MIN_OPERSTATE</i>[:<i>MAX_OPERSTATE</i>]],
       <b>--interface=</b><i>INTERFACE</i><b>[:</b><i>MIN_OPERSTATE</i>[:<i>MAX_OPERSTATE</i>]]
           Network interface to wait for before deciding if the system
           is online. This is useful when a system has several
           interfaces which will be configured, but a particular one is
           necessary to access some network resources. When used, all
           other interfaces are ignored. This option may be used more
           than once to wait for multiple network interfaces. When this
           option is specified multiple times, then
           <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>waits for all specified
           interfaces to be online. Optionally, required minimum and
           maximum operational states can be specified after a colon
           ":". Please see <a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl(1)</a> for possible operational
           states. If the operational state is not specified here, then
           the value from <i>RequiredForOnline=</i> in the corresponding
           .network file is used if present, and "degraded" otherwise.

           Added in version 213.

       <b>--ignore=</b><i>INTERFACE</i>
           Network interfaces to be ignored when deciding if the system
           is online. By default, only the loopback interface is
           ignored. This option may be used more than once to ignore
           multiple network interfaces.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>-o </b><i>MIN_OPERSTATE</i>[:<i>MAX_OPERSTATE</i>],
       <b>--operational-state=</b><i>MIN_OPERSTATE</i><b>[:</b><i>MAX_OPERSTATE</i>]
           Takes a minimum operational state and an optional maximum
           operational state. Please see <a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl(1)</a> for possible
           operational states. If set, the specified value overrides
           <i>RequiredForOnline=</i> settings in .network files. But this does
           not override operational states specified in <b>--interface=</b>
           option.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>-4</b>, <b>--ipv4</b>
           Waiting for an IPv4 address of each network interface to be
           configured. If this option is specified with <b>--any</b>, then
           <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>exits with success when at least
           one interface becomes online and has an IPv4 address. If the
           required minimum operational state is below "routable", then
           each link (or at least one link with <b>--any</b>) must have an IPv4
           link-local or routable address. If the required minimum
           operational state is "routable", then each link must have an
           IPv4 routable address.

           If neither <b>--ipv4 </b>nor <b>--ipv6 </b>is specified, then the value
           from <i>RequiredFamilyForOnline=</i> in the corresponding .network
           file is used if present.

           Added in version 249.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--ipv6</b>
           Waiting for an IPv6 address of each network interface to be
           configured. If this option is specified with <b>--any</b>, then
           <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>exits with success when at least
           one interface becomes online and has an IPv6 address. If the
           required minimum operational state is below "routable", then
           each link (or at least one link with <b>--any</b>) must have an IPv6
           link-local or routable address. If the required minimum
           operational state is "routable", then each link must have an
           IPv6 routable address.

           If neither <b>--ipv4 </b>nor <b>--ipv6 </b>is specified, then the value
           from <i>RequiredFamilyForOnline=</i> in the corresponding .network
           file is used if present.

           Added in version 249.

       <b>--any</b>
           Even if several interfaces are in configuring state,
           <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>exits with success when at least
           one interface becomes online. When this option is specified
           with <b>--interface=</b>, then <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>waits
           for one of the specified interfaces to be online. This option
           is useful when some interfaces may not have carrier on boot.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>--timeout=</b><i>SECS</i>
           Fail the service if the network is not online by the time the
           timeout elapses. A timeout of 0 disables the timeout.
           Defaults to 120 seconds.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppress log messages.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.
