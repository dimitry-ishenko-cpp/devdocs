</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       chgpasswd - update group passwords in batch mode
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>chgpasswd </b>[<i>options</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>chgpasswd </b>command reads a list of group name and password
       pairs from standard input and uses this information to update a
       set of existing groups. Each line is of the format:

       <i>group_name</i>:<i>password</i>

       By default the supplied password must be in clear-text, and is
       encrypted by <b>chgpasswd</b>.

       The default encryption algorithm can be defined for the system
       with the <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>variable of /etc/login.defs, and can be
       overwritten with the <b>-e</b>, <b>-m</b>, or <b>-c </b>options.

       This command is intended to be used in a large system environment
       where many accounts are created at a single time.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The options which apply to the <b>chgpasswd </b>command are:

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--crypt-method</b>
           Use the specified method to encrypt the passwords.

           The available methods are <i>DES</i>, <i>MD5</i>, <i>SHA256</i>, <i>SHA512</i> and <i>NONE</i>
           if your libc supports these methods.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--encrypted</b>
           Supplied passwords are in encrypted form.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help message and exit.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--md5</b>
           Use MD5 encryption instead of DES when the supplied passwords
           are not encrypted.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root </b><i>CHROOT_DIR</i>
           Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use the
           configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only
           absolute paths are supported.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sha-rounds</b>
           Use the specified number of rounds to encrypt the passwords.

           You can only use this option with crypt method: <i>SHA256 SHA512</i>

           By default, the number of rounds for SHA256 or SHA512 is
           defined by the SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS and SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS
           variables in /etc/login.defs.

           A minimal value of 1000 and a maximal value of 999,999,999
           will be enforced for SHA256 and SHA512. The default number of
           rounds is 5000.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       Remember to set permissions or umask to prevent readability of
       unencrypted files by other users.

       You should make sure the passwords and the encryption method
       respect the system's password policy.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
       the behavior of this tool:

       <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>(string)
           This defines the system default encryption algorithm for
           encrypting passwords (if no algorithm are specified on the
           command line).

           It can take one of these values: <i>DES</i> (default), <i>MD5</i>, <i>SHA256</i>,
           <i>SHA512</i>. MD5 and DES should not be used for new hashes, see
           crypt(5) for recommendations.

           Note: this parameter overrides the <b>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB </b>variable.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The
           generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to
           the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
           consistently with the PAM configuration.

       <b>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP </b>(number)
           Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached,
           a new group entry (line) is started in /etc/group (with the
           same name, same password, and same GID).

           The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in
           the number of members in a group.

           This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of
           lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
           lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters.

           If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

           Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in
           the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable
           unless you really need it.

       <b>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB </b>(boolean)
           Indicate if passwords must be encrypted using the MD5-based
           algorithm. If set to <i>yes</i>, new passwords will be encrypted
           using the MD5-based algorithm compatible with the one used by
           recent releases of FreeBSD. It supports passwords of
           unlimited length and longer salt strings. Set to <i>no</i> if you
           need to copy encrypted passwords to other systems which don't
           understand the new algorithm. Default is <i>no</i>.

           This variable is superseded by the <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>variable or
           by any command line option used to configure the encryption
           algorithm.

           This variable is deprecated. You should use <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD</b>.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The
           generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to
           the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
           consistently with the PAM configuration.

       <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS </b>(number), <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS </b>(number)
           When <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>is set to <i>SHA256</i> or <i>SHA512</i>, this defines
           the number of SHA rounds used by the encryption algorithm by
           default (when the number of rounds is not specified on the
           command line).

           With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute force the
           password. But note also that more CPU resources will be
           needed to authenticate users.

           If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of
           rounds (5000), which is orders of magnitude too low for
           modern hardware.

           The values must be inside the 1000-999,999,999 range.

           If only one of the <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS </b>or
           <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS </b>values is set, then this value will be
           used.

           If <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS </b>&gt; <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS</b>, the highest
           value will be used.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The
           generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to
           the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
           consistently with the PAM configuration.
