NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_access - PAM module for logdaemon style login access control
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_access.so </b>[debug] [nodefgroup] [noaudit] [accessfile=<i>file</i>]
                     [fieldsep=<i>sep</i>] [listsep=<i>sep</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_access PAM module is mainly for access management. It
       provides logdaemon style login access control based on login
       names, host or domain names, internet addresses or network
       numbers, or on terminal line names, X <i>$DISPLAY</i> values, or PAM
       service names in case of non-networked logins.

       By default rules for access management are taken from config file
       /etc/security/access.conf if you don't specify another file. Then
       individual *.conf files from the /etc/security/access.d/
       directory are read. The files are parsed one after another in the
       order of the system locale. The effect of the individual files is
       the same as if all the files were concatenated together in the
       order of parsing. This means that once a pattern is matched in
       some file no further files are parsed. If a config file is
       explicitly specified with the <b>accessfile </b>option the files in the
       above directory are not parsed.

       If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will
       report when it denies access based on origin (host, tty, etc.).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>accessfile=</b><i>/path/to/access.conf</i>
           Indicate an alternative access.conf style configuration file
           to override the default. This can be useful when different
           services need different access lists.

       <b>debug</b>
           A lot of debug information is printed with <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.

       <b>noaudit</b>
           Do not report logins from disallowed hosts and ttys to the
           audit subsystem.

       <b>fieldsep=</b><i>separators</i>
           This option modifies the field separator character that
           pam_access will recognize when parsing the access
           configuration file. For example: <b>fieldsep=| </b>will cause the
           default `:' character to be treated as part of a field value
           and `|' becomes the field separator. Doing this may be useful
           in conjunction with a system that wants to use pam_access
           with X based applications, since the <b>PAM_TTY </b>item is likely
           to be of the form "hostname:0" which includes a `:' character
           in its value. But you should not need this.

       <b>listsep=</b><i>separators</i>
           This option modifies the list separator character that
           pam_access will recognize when parsing the access
           configuration file. For example: <b>listsep=, </b>will cause the
           default ` ' (space) and `\t' (tab) characters to be treated
           as part of a list element value and `,' becomes the only list
           element separator. Doing this may be useful on a system with
           group information obtained from a Windows domain, where the
           default built-in groups "Domain Users", "Domain Admins"
           contain a space.

       <b>nodefgroup</b>
           User tokens which are not enclosed in parentheses will not be
           matched against the group database. The backwards compatible
           default is to try the group database match even for tokens
           not enclosed in parentheses.

AUTHORS </h2>
<pre>
       The logdaemon style login access control scheme was designed and
       implemented by Wietse Venema. The pam_access PAM module was
       developed by Alexei Nogin &lt;alexei@nogin.dnttm.ru&gt;. The IPv6
       support and the network(address) / netmask feature was developed
       and provided by Mike Becher &lt;mike.becher@lrz-muenchen.de&gt;.
