NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ovs-vswitchd - Open vSwitch daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>[<i>database</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A daemon that manages and controls any number of Open vSwitch
       switches on the local machine.

       The <i>database</i> argument specifies how <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>connects to
       <b>ovsdb-server</b>.  <i>database</i> may be an OVSDB active or passive
       connection method, as described in <a href="../man7/ovsdb.7.html">ovsdb(7)</a>.  The default is
       <b>unix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock</b>.

       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>retrieves its configuration from <i>database</i> at
       startup.  It sets up Open vSwitch datapaths and then operates
       switching across each bridge described in its configuration
       files.  As the database changes, <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>automatically
       updates its configuration to match.

       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>switches may be configured with any of the following
       features:

       •      L2 switching with MAC learning.

       •      NIC bonding with automatic fail-over and source MAC-based
              TX load balancing ("SLB").

       •      802.1Q VLAN support.

       •      Port mirroring, with optional VLAN tagging.

       •      NetFlow v5 flow logging.

       •      sFlow(R) monitoring.

       •      Connectivity to an external OpenFlow controller, such as
              NOX.

       Only a single instance of <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is intended to run at a
       time.  A single <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>can manage any number of switch
       instances, up to the maximum number of supported Open vSwitch
       datapaths.

       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>does all the necessary management of Open vSwitch
       datapaths itself.  Thus, <a href="ovs-dpctl.8.html">ovs-dpctl(8)</a> (and its userspace datapath
       counterparts accessible via <b>ovs-appctl dpctl/</b><i>command</i>) are not
       needed with <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>and should not be used because they can
       interfere with its operation.  These tools are still useful for
       diagnostics.

       An Open vSwitch datapath kernel module must be loaded for
       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>to be useful.  Refer to the documentation for
       instructions on how to build and load the Open vSwitch kernel
       module.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--mlockall</b>
              Causes <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>to call the <b>mlockall() </b>function, to
              attempt to lock all of its process memory into physical
              RAM, preventing the kernel from paging any of its memory
              to disk.  This helps to avoid networking interruptions due
              to system memory pressure.

              Some systems do not support <b>mlockall() </b>at all, and other
              systems only allow privileged users, such as the
              superuser, to use it.  <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>emits a log message if
              <b>mlockall() </b>is unavailable or unsuccessful.

   <b>DPDK Options</b>
       For details on initializing <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>to use DPDK ports, refer
       to the documentation or <a href="../man5/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</a>.

   <b>DPDK HW Access Options</b>
       <b>--hw-rawio-access</b>
              Tells <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>to retain the <b>CAP_SYS_RAWIO </b>capability,
              to allow userspace drivers access to raw hardware memory.
              This will also allow the <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>daemon to call
              <b>iopl() </b>and <b>ioperm() </b>functions as well as access memory
              devices to set port access.  This is a <b>very </b>powerful
              capability, so generally only enable as needed for
              specific hardware (for example mlx5 with full hardware
              offload via rte_flow).

   <b>Daemon Options</b>
       The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.

       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><i>pidfile</i>]
              Causes a file (by default, <b>ovs-vswitchd.pid</b>) to be created
              indicating the PID of the running process.  If the <i>pidfile</i>
              argument is not specified, or if it does not begin with <b>/</b>,
              then it is created in <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.

              If <b>--pidfile </b>is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By default, when <b>--pidfile </b>is specified and the specified
              pidfile already exists and is locked by a running process,
              <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>refuses to start.  Specify
              <b>--overwrite-pidfile </b>to cause it to instead overwrite the
              pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile </b>is not specified, this option has no
              effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>as a background process.  The process
              forks, and in the child it starts a new session, closes
              the standard file descriptors (which has the side effect
              of disabling logging to the console), and changes its
              current directory to the root (unless <b>--no-chdir </b>is
              specified).  After the child completes its initialization,
              the parent exits.  <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>detaches only after it has
              connected to the database, retrieved the initial
              configuration, and set up that configuration.

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates an additional process to monitor the <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
              daemon.  If the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates
              a programming error (<b>SIGABRT</b>, <b>SIGALRM</b>, <b>SIGBUS</b>, <b>SIGFPE</b>,
              <b>SIGILL</b>, <b>SIGPIPE</b>, <b>SIGSEGV</b>, <b>SIGXCPU</b>, or <b>SIGXFSZ</b>) then the
              monitor process starts a new copy of it.  If the daemon
              dies or exits for another reason, the monitor process
              exits.

              This option is normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but it also
              functions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By default, when <b>--detach </b>is specified, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
              changes its current working directory to the root
              directory after it detaches.  Otherwise, invoking
              <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>from a carelessly chosen directory would
              prevent the administrator from unmounting the file system
              that holds that directory.

              Specifying <b>--no-chdir </b>suppresses this behavior, preventing
              <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>from changing its current working directory.
              This may be useful for collecting core files, since it is
              common behavior to write core dumps into the current
              working directory and the root directory is not a good
              directory to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach </b>is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By default daemon will try to self-confine itself to work
              with files under well-known directories determined during
              build.  It is better to stick with this default behavior
              and not to use this flag unless some other Access Control
              is used to confine daemon.  Note that in contrast to other
              access control implementations that are typically enforced
              from kernel-space (e.g. DAC or MAC), self-confinement is
              imposed from the user-space daemon itself and hence should
              not be considered as a full confinement strategy, but
              instead should be viewed as an additional layer of
              security.

       <b>--user </b>Causes <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>to run as a different user specified
              in "user:group", thus dropping most of the root
              privileges. Short forms "user" and ":group" are also
              allowed, with current user or group are assumed
              respectively. Only daemons started by the root user
              accepts this argument.

              On Linux, daemons will be granted CAP_IPC_LOCK and
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES before dropping root privileges.
              Daemons that interact with a datapath, such as
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, will be granted three additional
              capabilities, namely CAP_NET_ADMIN, CAP_NET_BROADCAST and
              CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability change will apply even if the
              new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For
              security reasons, specifying this option will cause the
              daemon process not to start.

   <b>Service Options</b>
       The following options are valid only on Windows platform.

       <b>--service</b>
              Causes <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>to run as a service in the background.
              The service should already have been created through
              external tools like <b>SC.exe</b>.

       <b>--service-monitor</b>
              Causes the <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>service to be automatically
              restarted by the Windows services manager if the service
              dies or exits for unexpected reasons.

              When <b>--service </b>is not specified, this option has no
              effect.

   <b>Public Key Infrastructure Options</b>
       <b>-p </b><i>privkey.pem</i>
       <b>--private-key=</b><i>privkey.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       <b>-c </b><i>cert.pem</i>
       <b>--certificate=</b><i>cert.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that
              certifies the private key specified on <b>-p </b>or <b>--private-key</b>
              to be trustworthy.  The certificate must be signed by the
              certificate authority (CA) that the peer in SSL
              connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C </b><i>cacert.pem</i>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><i>cacert.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that
              <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>should use to verify certificates presented
              to it by SSL peers.  (This may be the same certificate
              that SSL peers use to verify the certificate specified on
              <b>-c </b>or <b>--certificate</b>, or it may be a different one,
              depending on the PKI design in use.)

       <b>-C none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL
              peers.  This introduces a security risk, because it means
              that certificates cannot be verified to be those of known
              trusted hosts.

       <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><i>cacert.pem</i>
              When <i>cacert.pem</i> exists, this option has the same effect as
              <b>-C </b>or <b>--ca-cert</b>.  If it does not exist, then <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
              will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL
              peer on its first SSL connection and save it to the named
              PEM file.  If it is successful, it will immediately drop
              the connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL
              connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed
              by the CA certificate thus obtained.

              <b>This option exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-the-</b>
              <b>middle attack obtaining the initial CA certificate</b>, but it
              may be useful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA
              certificate as part of the SSL certificate chain.  The SSL
              protocol does not require the server to send the CA
              certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C </b>and <b>--ca-cert</b>.

       <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><i>peer-cacert.pem</i>
              Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more additional
              certificates to send to SSL peers.  <i>peer-cacert.pem</i> should
              be the CA certificate used to sign <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own
              certificate, that is, the certificate specified on <b>-c </b>or
              <b>--certificate</b>.  If <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s certificate is self-
              signed, then <b>--certificate </b>and <b>--peer-ca-cert </b>should
              specify the same file.

              This option is not useful in normal operation, because the
              SSL peer must already have the CA certificate for the peer
              to have any confidence in <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s identity.
              However, this offers a way for a new installation to
              bootstrap the CA certificate on its first SSL connection.

   <b>Logging Options</b>
       <b>-v</b>[<i>spec</i>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<i>spec</i>]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any <i>spec</i>, sets the log level
              for every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <i>spec</i>
              is a list of words separated by spaces or commas or
              colons, up to one from each category below:

              •      A valid module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b>
                     command on <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a>, limits the log level
                     change to the specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level
                     change to only to the system log, to the console,
                     or to a file, respectively.  (If <b>--detach </b>is
                     specified, <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>closes its standard file
                     descriptors, so logging to the console will have no
                     effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog </b>is accepted as a word
                     and is only useful along with the <b>--syslog-target</b>
                     option (the word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the
                     log level.  Messages of the given severity or
                     higher will be logged, and messages of lower
                     severity will be filtered out.  <b>off </b>filters out all
                     messages.  See <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a definition of
                     each log level.

              Case is not significant within <i>spec</i>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a
              file will not take place unless <b>--log-file </b>is also
              specified (see below).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any </b>is
              accepted as a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
              <b>--verbose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
              Sets the log pattern for <i>destination</i> to <i>pattern</i>.  Refer to
              <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a description of the valid syntax for
              <i>pattern</i>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><i>facility</i>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><i>facility</i>
              Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. <i>facility</i> can
              be one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>,
              <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>, <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>,
              <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>, <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6 </b>or <b>local7</b>.
              If this option is not specified, <b>daemon </b>is used as the
              default for the local system syslog and <b>local0 </b>is used
              while sending a message to the target provided via the
              <b>--syslog-target </b>option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
              Enables logging to a file.  If <i>file</i> is specified, then it
              is used as the exact name for the log file.  The default
              log file name used if <i>file</i> is omitted is
              <b>/usr/local/var/log/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><i>host</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <i>port</i> on <i>host</i>, in addition to
              the system syslog.  The <i>host</i> must be a numerical IP
              address, not a hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><i>method</i>
              Specify <i>method</i> how syslog messages should be sent to
              syslog daemon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog() </b>function.  Downside of
                     using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix
                     to every message before it is actually sent to the
                     syslog daemon over <b>/dev/log </b>UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><i>file</i>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is
                     possible to specify arbitrary message format with
                     this option.  However, <b>rsyslogd 8.9 </b>and older
                     versions use hard coded parser function anyway that
                     limits UNIX domain socket use.  If you want to use
                     arbitrary message format with older <b>rsyslogd</b>
                     versions, then use UDP socket to localhost IP
                     address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><i>ip</i>:<i>port</i>, use UDP socket.  With this method it
                     is possible to use arbitrary message format also
                     with older <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages
                     over UDP socket extra precaution needs to be taken
                     into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to
                     be configured to listen on the specified UDP port,
                     accidental iptables rules could be interfering with
                     local syslog traffic and there are some security
                     considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do
                     not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is taken from the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>
              environment variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

   <b>Other Options</b>
       <b>--unixctl=</b><i>socket</i>
              Sets the name of the control socket on which <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
              listens for runtime management commands (see <b>RUNTIME</b>
              <b>MANAGEMENT COMMANDS</b>, below).  If <i>socket</i> does not begin
              with <b>/</b>, it is interpreted as relative to
              <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.  If <b>--unixctl </b>is not used
              at all, the default socket is
              <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.</b><i>pid</i><b>.ctl</b>, where
              <i>pid</i> is <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s process ID.

              On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for
              runtime management commands.  A file is created in the
              absolute path as pointed by <i>socket</i> or if <b>--unixctl </b>is not
              used at all, a file is created as <b>ovs-vswitchd.ctl </b>in the
              configured <i>OVS_RUNDIR</i> directory.  The file exists just to
              mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.

              Specifying <b>none </b>for <i>socket</i> disables the control socket
              feature.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help </b>Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> can send commands to a running <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
       process.  The currently supported commands are described below.
       The command descriptions assume an understanding of how to
       configure Open vSwitch.

   <b>GENERAL COMMANDS</b>
       <b>exit </b><i>--cleanup</i>
              Causes <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>to gracefully terminate. If <i>--cleanup</i>
              is specified, deletes flows from datapaths and releases
              other datapath resources configured by <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.
              Otherwise, datapath flows and other resources remains
              undeleted.  Resources of datapaths that are integrated
              into <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>(e.g.  the <b>netdev </b>datapath type) are
              always released regardless of <i>--cleanup</i> except for ports
              with <b>internal </b>type. Use <i>--cleanup</i> to release <b>internal</b>
              ports too.

       <b>qos/show-types </b><i>interface</i>
              Queries the interface for a list of Quality of Service
              types that are configurable via Open vSwitch for the given
              <i>interface</i>.

       <b>qos/show </b><i>interface</i>
              Queries the kernel for Quality of Service configuration
              and statistics associated with the given <i>interface</i>.

       <b>bfd/show </b>[<i>interface</i>]
              Displays detailed information about Bidirectional
              Forwarding Detection configured on <i>interface</i>.  If
              <i>interface</i> is not specified, then displays detailed
              information about all interfaces with BFD enabled.

       <b>bfd/set-forwarding </b>[<i>interface</i>] <i>status</i>
              Force the fault status of the BFD module on <i>interface</i> (or
              all interfaces if none is given) to be <i>status</i>.  <i>status</i> can
              be "true", "false", or "normal" which reverts to the
              standard behavior.

       <b>cfm/show </b>[<i>interface</i>]
              Displays detailed information about Connectivity Fault
              Management configured on <i>interface</i>.  If <i>interface</i> is not
              specified, then displays detailed information about all
              interfaces with CFM enabled.

       <b>cfm/set-fault </b>[<i>interface</i>] <i>status</i>
              Force the fault status of the CFM module on <i>interface</i> (or
              all interfaces if none is given) to be <i>status</i>.  <i>status</i> can
              be "true", "false", or "normal" which reverts to the
              standard behavior.

       <b>stp/tcn </b>[<i>bridge</i>]
              Forces a topology change event on <i>bridge</i> if it's running
              STP.  This may cause it to send Topology Change
              Notifications to its peers and flush its MAC table.  If no
              <i>bridge</i> is given, forces a topology change event on all
              bridges.

       <b>stp/show </b>[<i>bridge</i>]
              Displays detailed information about spanning tree on the
              <i>bridge</i>.  If <i>bridge</i> is not specified, then displays
              detailed information about all bridges with STP enabled.

       <b>rstp/tcn </b>[<i>bridge</i>]
              Forces a topology change event on <i>bridge</i> if it's running
              RSTP.  This may cause it to send Topology Change
              Notifications to its peers and flush its MAC table.  If no
              <i>bridge</i> is given, forces a topology change event on all
              bridges.

       <b>rstp/show </b>[<i>bridge</i>]
              Displays detailed information about rapid spanning tree on
              the <i>bridge</i>.  If <i>bridge</i> is not specified, then displays
              detailed information about all bridges with RSTP enabled.

   <b>BRIDGE COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage bridges.

       <b>fdb/add </b><i>bridge port vlan mac</i>
              Adds <i>mac</i> address to a <i>port</i> and <i>vlan</i> on a <i>bridge</i>. This
              utility can be used to pre-populate fdb table without
              relying on dynamic mac learning.

       <b>fdb/del </b><i>bridge vlan mac</i>
              Deletes <i>mac</i> address from a <i>port</i> and <i>vlan</i> on a <i>bridge</i>.

       <b>fdb/flush </b>[<i>bridge</i>]
              Flushes <i>bridge</i> MAC address learning table, or all learning
              tables if no <i>bridge</i> is given.

       <b>fdb/show </b><i>bridge</i>
              Lists each MAC address/VLAN pair learned by the specified
              <i>bridge</i>, along with the port on which it was learned and
              the age of the entry, in seconds.

       <b>fdb/stats-clear </b>[<i>bridge</i>]
              Clear <i>bridge</i> MAC address learning table statistics, or all
              statistics if no <i>bridge</i> is given.

       <b>fdb/stats-show </b><i>bridge</i>
              Show MAC address learning table statistics for the
              specified <i>bridge</i>.

       <b>mdb/flush </b>[<i>bridge</i>]
              Flushes <i>bridge</i> multicast snooping table, or all snooping
              tables if no <i>bridge</i> is given.

       <b>mdb/show </b><i>bridge</i>
              Lists each multicast group/VLAN pair learned by the
              specified <i>bridge</i>, along with the port on which it was
              learned and the age of the entry, in seconds.

       <b>bridge/reconnect </b>[<i>bridge</i>]
              Makes <i>bridge</i> drop all of its OpenFlow controller
              connections and reconnect.  If <i>bridge</i> is not specified,
              then all bridges drop their controller connections and
              reconnect.

              This command might be useful for debugging OpenFlow
              controller issues.

       <b>bridge/dump-flows </b>[<b>--offload-stats</b>] <i>bridge</i>
              Lists all flows in <i>bridge</i>, including those normally hidden
              to commands such as <b>ovs-ofctl dump-flows</b>.  Flows set up by
              mechanisms such as in-band control and fail-open are
              hidden from the controller since it is not allowed to
              modify or override them.  If <b>--offload-stats </b>are specified
              then also list statistics for offloaded packets and bytes,
              which are a subset of the total packets and bytes.

   <b>BOND COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage bonded ports on an Open vSwitch's bridges.
       To understand some of these commands, it is important to
       understand a detail of the bonding implementation called ``source
       load balancing'' (SLB).  Instead of directly assigning Ethernet
       source addresses to members, the bonding implementation computes
       a function that maps an 48-bit Ethernet source addresses into an
       8-bit value (a ``MAC hash'' value).  All of the Ethernet
       addresses that map to a single 8-bit value are then assigned to a
       single member.

       <b>bond/list</b>
              Lists all of the bonds, and their members, on each bridge.

       <b>bond/show </b>[<i>port</i>]
              Lists all of the bond-specific information (updelay,
              downdelay, time until the next rebalance) about the given
              bonded <i>port</i>, or all bonded ports if no <i>port</i> is given.
              Also lists information about each members: whether it is
              enabled or disabled, the time to completion of an updelay
              or downdelay if one is in progress, whether it is the
              active member, the hashes assigned to the member.  Any
              LACP information related to this bond may be found using
              the <b>lacp/show </b>command.

       <b>bond/migrate </b><i>port hash member</i>
              Only valid for SLB bonds.  Assigns a given MAC hash to a
              new member.  <i>port</i> specifies the bond port, <i>hash</i> the MAC
              hash to be migrated (as a decimal number between 0 and
              255), and <i>member</i> the new member to be assigned.

              The reassignment is not permanent: rebalancing or fail-
              over will cause the MAC hash to be shifted to a new member
              in the usual manner.

              A MAC hash cannot be migrated to a disabled member.

       <b>bond/set-active-member </b><i>port member</i>
              Sets <i>member</i> as the active member on <i>port</i>.  <i>member</i> must
              currently be enabled.

              The setting is not permanent: a new active member will be
              selected if <i>member</i> becomes disabled.

       <b>bond/enable-member </b><i>port member</i>
       <b>bond/disable-member </b><i>port member</i>
              Enables (or disables) <i>member</i> on the given bond <i>port</i>,
              skipping any updelay (or downdelay).

              This setting is not permanent: it persists only until the
              carrier status of <i>member</i> changes.

       <b>bond/hash </b><i>mac</i> [<i>vlan</i>] [<i>basis</i>]
              Returns the hash value which would be used for <i>mac</i> with
              <i>vlan</i> and <i>basis</i> if specified.

       <b>lacp/show </b>[<i>port</i>]
              Lists all of the LACP related information about the given
              <i>port</i>: active or passive, aggregation key, system id, and
              system priority.  Also lists information about each
              member: whether it is enabled or disabled, whether it is
              attached or detached, port id and priority, actor
              information, and partner information.  If <i>port</i> is not
              specified, then displays detailed information about all
              interfaces with CFM enabled.

       <b>lacp/stats-show </b>[<i>port</i>]
              Lists various stats about LACP PDUs (number of RX/TX PDUs,
              bad PDUs received) and member state (number of times its
              state expired/defaulted and carrier status changed) for
              the given <i>port</i>.  If <i>port</i> is not specified, then displays
              stats of all interfaces with LACP enabled.

   <b>DPCTL DATAPATH DEBUGGING COMMANDS</b>
       The primary way to configure <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is through the Open
       vSwitch database, e.g. using <a href="ovs-vsctl.8.html">ovs-vsctl(8)</a>.  These commands
       provide a debugging interface for managing datapaths.  They
       implement the same features (and syntax) as <a href="ovs-dpctl.8.html">ovs-dpctl(8)</a>.  Unlike
       <a href="ovs-dpctl.8.html">ovs-dpctl(8)</a>, these commands work with datapaths that are
       integrated into <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>(e.g. the <b>netdev </b>datapath type).

       Do not use commands to add or remove or modify datapaths if
       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is running because this interferes with
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own datapath management.

       <b>dpctl/add-dp </b><i>dp</i> [<i>netdev</i>[<b>,</b><i>option</i>]...]
              Creates datapath <i>dp</i>, with a local port also named <i>dp</i>.
              This will fail if a network device <i>dp</i> already exists.

              If <i>netdev</i>s are specified, <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>adds them to the
              new datapath, just as if <b>add-if </b>was specified.

       <b>dpctl/del-dp </b><i>dp</i>
              Deletes datapath <i>dp</i>.  If <i>dp</i> is associated with any network
              devices, they are automatically removed.

       <b>dpctl/add-if </b><i>dp netdev</i>[<b>,</b><i>option</i>]...
              Adds each <i>netdev</i> to the set of network devices datapath <i>dp</i>
              monitors, where <i>dp</i> is the name of an existing datapath,
              and <i>netdev</i> is the name of one of the host's network
              devices, e.g. <b>eth0</b>.  Once a network device has been added
              to a datapath, the datapath has complete ownership of the
              network device's traffic and the network device appears
              silent to the rest of the system.

              A <i>netdev</i> may be followed by a comma-separated list of
              options.  The following options are currently supported:

              <b>type=</b><i>type</i>
                     Specifies the type of port to add.  The default
                     type is <b>system</b>.

              <b>port_no=</b><i>port</i>
                     Requests a specific port number within the
                     datapath.  If this option is not specified then one
                     will be automatically assigned.

              <i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
                     Adds an arbitrary key-value option to the port's
                     configuration.

              <a href="../man5/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</a> documents the available port types
              and options.

       <b>dpctl/set-if </b><i>dp port</i>[<b>,</b><i>option</i>]...
              Reconfigures each <i>port</i> in <i>dp</i> as specified.  An <i>option</i> of
              the form <i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> adds the specified key-value option to
              the port or overrides an existing key's value.  An <i>option</i>
              of the form <i>key</i><b>=</b>, that is, without a value, deletes the
              key-value named <i>key</i>.  The type and port number of a port
              cannot be changed, so <b>type </b>and <b>port_no </b>are only allowed if
              they match the existing configuration.

       <b>dpctl/del-if </b><i>dp netdev</i>...
              Removes each <i>netdev</i> from the list of network devices
              datapath <i>dp</i> monitors.

       <b>dpctl/dump-dps</b>
              Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate
              line.

       <b>dpctl/show [-s </b>| <b>--statistics</b>] [<i>dp</i>...]
              Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including their
              datapath numbers and a list of ports connected to each
              datapath.  (The local port is identified as port 0.)  If
              <b>-s </b>or <b>--statistics </b>is specified, then packet and byte
              counters are also printed for each port.

              The datapath numbers consists of flow stats and mega flow
              mask stats.

              The "lookups" row displays three stats related to flow
              lookup triggered by processing incoming packets in the
              datapath. "hit" displays number of packets matches
              existing flows. "missed" displays the number of packets
              not matching any existing flow and require user space
              processing.  "lost" displays number of packets destined
              for user space process but subsequently dropped before
              reaching userspace. The sum of "hit" and "miss" equals to
              the total number of packets datapath processed.

              The "flows" row displays the number of flows in datapath.

              The "masks" row displays the mega flow mask stats. This
              row is omitted for datapath not implementing mega flow.
              "hit" displays the total number of masks visited for
              matching incoming packets. "total" displays number of
              masks in the datapath. "hit/pkt" displays the average
              number of masks visited per packet; the ratio between
              "hit" and total number of packets processed by the
              datapath.

              If one or more datapaths are specified, information on
              only those datapaths are displayed.  Otherwise,
              <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>displays information about all configured
              datapaths.

   <b>DATAPATH FLOW TABLE DEBUGGING COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are primarily useful for debugging Open
       vSwitch.  The flow table entries (both matches and actions) that
       they work with are not OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are
       different and considerably simpler flows maintained by the Open
       vSwitch kernel module.  Do not use commands to add or remove or
       modify datapath flows if <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is running because it
       interferes with <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own datapath flow management.  Use
       <a href="ovs-ofctl.8.html">ovs-ofctl(8)</a>, instead, to work with OpenFlow flow entries.

       The <i>dp</i> argument to each of these commands is optional when
       exactly one datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the
       default.  When multiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is
       required.

       <b>dpctl/dump-flows </b>[<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>] [<b>--names </b>| <b>--no-names</b>] [<i>dp</i>]
       [<b>filter=</b><i>filter</i>] [<b>type=</b><i>type</i>] [<b>pmd=</b><i>pmd</i>]
              Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath <i>dp</i>'s
              flow table.  Without <b>-m </b>or <b>--more</b>, output omits match
              fields that a flow wildcards entirely; with <b>-m </b>or <b>--more</b>,
              output includes all wildcarded fields.

              If <b>filter=</b><i>filter</i> is specified, only displays the flows
              that match the <i>filter</i>. <i>filter</i> is a flow in the form
              similar to that accepted by <a href="ovs-ofctl.8.html">ovs-ofctl(8)</a>'s <b>add-flow</b>
              command. (This is not an OpenFlow flow: besides other
              differences, it never contains wildcards.)  The <i>filter</i> is
              also useful to match wildcarded fields in the datapath
              flow. As an example, <b>filter='tcp,tp_src=100' </b>will match
              the datapath flow containing
              '<b>tcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)</b>'.

              If <b>pmd=</b><i>pmd</i> is specified, only displays flows of the
              specified pmd.  Using <b>pmd=</b><i>-1</i> will restrict the dump to
              flows from the main thread.  This option is only supported
              by the <b>userspace datapath</b>.

              If <b>type=</b><i>type</i> is specified, only displays flows of the
              specified types.  This option supported only for
              <b>ovs-appctl dpctl/dump-flows</b>.  <i>type</i> is a comma separated
              list, which can contain any of the following:
                 <b>ovs </b>- displays flows handled in the ovs dp
                 <b>tc </b>- displays flows handled in the tc dp
                 <b>dpdk </b>- displays flows fully offloaded by dpdk
                 <b>offloaded </b>- displays flows offloaded to the HW
                 <b>non-offloaded </b>- displays flows not offloaded to the HW
                 <b>partially-offloaded </b>- displays flows where only part of
              their proccessing is done in HW
                 <b>all </b>- displays all the types of flows

              By default all the types of flows are displayed.
              <b>ovs-dpctl </b>always acts as if the <b>type </b>was <i>ovs</i>.

       <b>dpctl/add-flow </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>flow actions</i>

       <b>dpctl/mod-flow </b>[<b>--clear</b>] [<b>--may-create</b>] [<b>-s </b>| <b>--statistics</b>] [<i>dp</i>]
       <i>flow actions</i>
              Adds or modifies a flow in <i>dp</i>'s flow table that, when a
              packet matching <i>flow</i> arrives, causes <i>actions</i> to be
              executed.

              The <b>add-flow </b>command succeeds only if <i>flow</i> does not
              already exist in <i>dp</i>.  Contrariwise, <b>mod-flow </b>without
              <b>--may-create </b>only modifies the actions for an existing
              flow.  With <b>--may-create</b>, <b>mod-flow </b>will add a new flow or
              modify an existing one.

              If <b>-s </b>or <b>--statistics </b>is specified, then <b>mod-flow </b>prints
              the modified flow's statistics.  A flow's statistics are
              the number of packets and bytes that have passed through
              the flow, the elapsed time since the flow last processed a
              packet (if ever), and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP
              flags processed through the flow.

              With <b>--clear</b>, <b>mod-flow </b>zeros out the flow's statistics.
              The statistics printed if <b>-s </b>or <b>--statistics </b>is also
              specified are those from just before clearing the
              statistics.

              NOTE: <i>flow</i> and <i>actions</i> do not match the syntax used with
              <a href="ovs-ofctl.8.html">ovs-ofctl(8)</a>'s <b>add-flow </b>command.

              <b>Usage Examples</b>

              Forward ARP between ports 1 and 2 on datapath myDP:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 2

                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 1

              Forward all IPv4 traffic between two addresses on ports 1
              and 2:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.4,dst=172.31.110.5)" 2

       <b>dpctl/add-flows </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>file</i>
       <b>dpctl/mod-flows </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>file</i>
       <b>dpctl/del-flows </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>file</i>
              Reads flow entries from <i>file</i> (or <b>stdin </b>if <i>file</i> is <b>-</b>) and
              adds, modifies, or deletes each entry to the datapath.
              Each flow specification (e.g., each line in <i>file</i>) may
              start with <b>add</b>, <b>modify</b>, or <b>delete </b>keyword to specify
              whether a flow is to be added, modified, or deleted. A
              flow specification without one of these keywords is
              treated based on the used command.  All flow modifications
              are executed as individual transactions in the order
              specified.

       <b>dpctl/del-flow </b>[<b>-s </b>| <b>--statistics</b>] [<i>dp</i>] <i>flow</i>
              Deletes the flow from <i>dp</i>'s flow table that matches <i>flow</i>.
              If <b>-s </b>or <b>--statistics </b>is specified, then <b>del-flow </b>prints
              the deleted flow's statistics.

       <b>dpctl/get-flow </b>[<i>dp</i>] ufid:<i>ufid</i> [<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>] [<b>--names </b>|
       <b>--no-names</b>]
              Fetches the flow from <i>dp</i>'s flow table with unique
              identifier <i>ufid</i>.  <i>ufid</i> must be specified as a string of 32
              hexadecimal characters.

       <b>dpctl/del-flows </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Deletes all flow entries from datapath <i>dp</i>'s flow table.

   <b>DATAPATH FLOW CACHE COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are useful for debugging and configuring
       the datapath flow cache settings.

       <b>dpctl/cache-get-size </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Prints the current cache sizes to the console.

       <b>dpctl/cache-set-size </b><i>dp cache size</i>
              Set the <i>dp</i>'s specific <i>cache</i> to the given <i>size</i>.  The cache
              name can be found by using the <b>cache-get-size </b>command.

   <b>CONNECTION TRACKING TABLE COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are useful for debugging and configuring
       the connection tracking table in the datapath.

       The <i>dp</i> argument to each of these commands is optional when
       exactly one datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the
       default.  When multiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is
       required.

       <b>N.B.</b>(Linux specific): the <i>system</i> datapaths (i.e. the Linux kernel
       module Open vSwitch datapaths) share a single connection tracking
       table (which is also used by other kernel subsystems, such as
       iptables, nftables and the regular host stack).  Therefore, the
       following commands do not apply specifically to one datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ipf-set-enabled </b>[<i>dp</i>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b>
       <b>dpctl/ipf-set-disabled </b>[<i>dp</i>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b>
              Enables or disables IP fragmentation handling for the
              userspace connection tracker.  Either <b>v4 </b>or <b>v6 </b>must be
              specified.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly are
              enabled by default.  Only supported for the userspace
              datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ipf-set-min-frag </b>[<i>dp</i>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6 </b><i>minfrag</i>
              Sets the minimum fragment size (L3 header and data) for
              non-final fragments to <i>minfrag</i>.  Either <b>v4 </b>or <b>v6 </b>must be
              specified.  For enhanced DOS security, higher minimum
              fragment sizes can usually be used.  The default IPv4
              value is 1200 and the clamped minimum is 400.  The default
              IPv6 value is 1280, with a clamped minimum of 400, for
              testing flexibility.  The maximum fragment size is not
              clamped, however, setting this value too high might result
              in valid fragments being dropped.  Only supported for
              userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ipf-set-max-nfrags </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>maxfrags</i>
              Sets the maximum number of fragments tracked by the
              userspace datapath connection tracker to <i>maxfrags</i>.  The
              default value is 1000 and the clamped maximum is 5000.
              Note that packet buffers can be held by the fragmentation
              module while fragments are incomplete, but will timeout
              after 15 seconds.  Memory pool sizing should be set
              accordingly when fragmentation is enabled.  Only supported
              for userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ipf-get-status </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>]
              Gets the configuration settings and fragment counters
              associated with the fragmentation handling of the
              userspace datapath connection tracker.  With <b>-m </b>or <b>--more</b>,
              also dumps the IP fragment lists.  Only supported for
              userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/dump-conntrack </b>[<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>] [<b>-s </b>| <b>--statistics</b>] [<i>dp</i>]
       [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>]
              Prints to the console all the connection entries in the
              tracker used by <i>dp</i>.  If <b>zone=</b><i>zone</i> is specified, only shows
              the connections in <i>zone</i>.  With <b>--more</b>, some implementation
              specific details are included. With <b>--statistics </b>timeouts
              and timestamps are added to the output.

       <b>dpctl/dump-conntrack-exp </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>]
              Prints to the console all the expectation entries in the
              tracker used by <i>dp</i>.  If <b>zone=</b><i>zone</i> is specified, only shows
              the expectations in <i>zone</i>. Only supported for userspace
              datapath.

       <b>dpctl/flush-conntrack </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>] [<i>ct-origin-tuple</i> [<i>ct-</i>
       <i>reply-tuple</i>]]
              Flushes the connection entries in the tracker used by <i>dp</i>
              based on <i>zone</i> and connection tracking tuple <i>ct-origin-</i>
              <i>tuple</i>.  If <i>ct-tuple</i> is not provided, flushes all the
              connection entries.  If <b>zone</b>=<i>zone</i> is specified, only
              flushes the connections in <i>zone</i>.

              If <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i> is provided, flushes the
              connection entry specified by <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i> in
              <i>zone</i>.  The zone defaults to 0 if it is not provided.  The
              userspace connection tracker requires flushing with the
              original pre-NATed tuple and a warning log will be
              otherwise generated.  The tuple can be partial and will
              remove all connections that are matching on the specified
              fields.  In order to specify only <i>ct-reply-tuple</i>, provide
              empty string as <i>ct-origin-tuple</i>.

              Note: Currently there is a limitation for matching on
              ICMP, in order to partially match on ICMP parameters the
              <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i> has to include either source or
              destination IP.

              An example of an IPv4 ICMP <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i>:

              "ct_nw_src=10.1.1.1,ct_nw_dst=10.1.1.2,ct_nw_proto=1,icmp_type=8,icmp_code=0,icmp_id=10"

              An example of an IPv6 TCP <i>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</i>:

              "ct_ipv6_src=fc00::1,ct_ipv6_dst=fc00::2,ct_nw_proto=6,ct_tp_src=1,ct_tp_dst=2"

       <b>dpctl/ct-stats-show </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>] [<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>]
              Displays the number of connections grouped by protocol
              used by <i>dp</i>.  If <b>zone=</b><i>zone</i> is specified, numbers refer to
              the connections in <i>zone</i>.  With <b>--more</b>, groups by
              connection state for each protocol.

       <b>dpctl/ct-bkts </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>gt=</b><i>threshold</i>]
              For each conntrack bucket, displays the number of
              connections used by <i>dp</i>.  If <b>gt=</b><i>threshold</i> is specified,
              bucket numbers are displayed when the number of
              connections in a bucket is greater than <i>threshold</i>.

       <b>dpctl/ct-set-maxconns </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>maxconns</i>
              Sets the maximum limit of connection tracker entries to
              <i>maxconns</i> on <i>dp</i>.  This can be used to reduce the processing
              load on the system due to connection tracking or simply
              limiting connection tracking.  If the number of
              connections is already over the new maximum limit request
              then the new maximum limit will be enforced when the
              number of connections decreases to that limit, which
              normally happens due to connection expiry.  Only supported
              for userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-get-maxconns </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Prints the maximum limit of connection tracker entries on
              <i>dp</i>.  Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-get-nconns </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Prints the current number of connection tracker entries on
              <i>dp</i>.  Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-enable-tcp-seq-chk </b>[<i>dp</i>]
       <b>dpctl/ct-disable-tcp-seq-chk </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Enables or disables TCP sequence checking.  When set to
              disabled, all sequence number verification is disabled,
              including for TCP resets.  This is similar, but not the
              same as 'be_liberal' mode, as in Netfilter.  Disabling
              sequence number verification is not an optimization in
              itself, but is needed for some hardware offload support
              which might offer some performance advantage. Sequence
              number checking is enabled by default to enforce better
              security and should only be disabled if required for
              hardware offload support.  This command is only supported
              for the userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-get-tcp-seq-chk </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Prints whether TCP sequence checking is enabled or
              disabled on <i>dp</i>.  Only supported for the userspace
              datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-set-sweep-interval </b>[<i>dp</i>] <i>ms</i>
              Sets the sweep interval. Only supported for the userspace
              datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-get-sweep-interval </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              Prints the current sweep interval in ms. Only supported
              for the userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-set-limits </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>default=</b><i>default_limit</i>]
       [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>,<b>limit=</b><i>limit</i>]...
              Sets the maximum allowed number of connections in a
              connection tracking zone.  A specific <i>zone</i> may be set to
              <i>limit</i>, and multiple zones may be specified with a comma-
              separated list.  If a per-zone limit for a particular zone
              is not specified in the datapath, it defaults to the
              default per-zone limit.  A default zone may be specified
              with the <b>default=</b><i>default_limit</i> argument.   Initially, the
              default per-zone limit is unlimited.  An unlimited number
              of entries may be set with <b>0 </b>limit.

       <b>dpctl/ct-del-limits </b>[<i>dp</i>] <b>zone=</b><i>zone[,zone]</i>...
              Deletes the connection tracking limit for <i>zone</i>.  Multiple
              zones may be specified with a comma-separated list.

       <b>dpctl/ct-get-limits </b>[<i>dp</i>] [<b>zone=</b><i>zone</i>[<b>,</b><i>zone</i>]...]
              Retrieves the maximum allowed number of connections and
              current counts per-zone.  If <i>zone</i> is given, only the
              specified zone(s) are printed.  If no zones are specified,
              all the zone limits and counts are provided.  The command
              always displays the default zone limit.

   <b>DPDK COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage DPDK components.

       <b>dpdk/lcore-list</b>
              Lists the DPDK lcores and their cpu affinity.  When
              RTE_MAX_LCORE lcores are registered, some OVS PMD threads
              won't appear.

       <b>dpdk/log-list</b>
              Lists all DPDK components that emit logs and their logging
              levels.

       <b>dpdk/log-set </b>[<i>spec</i>]
              Sets DPDK components logging level. Without any <i>spec</i>, sets
              the logging <b>level </b>for all DPDK components to <b>debug</b>.
              Otherwise, <i>spec</i> is a list of words separated by spaces: a
              word can be either a logging <b>level </b>(<b>emergency</b>, <b>alert</b>,
              <b>critical</b>, <b>error</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info </b>or <b>debug</b>) or a
              <b>pattern </b>matching DPDK components (see <b>dpdk/log-list</b>
              command on <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a>) separated by a colon from the
              logging <b>level </b>to apply.

       <b>dpdk/get-malloc-stats</b>
              Prints the heap information statistics about DPDK malloc.

   <b>DPIF-NETDEV COMMANDS</b>
       These commands are used to expose internal information (mostly
       statistics) about the "dpif-netdev" userspace datapath. If there
       is only one datapath (as is often the case, unless <b>dpctl/</b>
       commands are used), the <i>dp</i> argument can be omitted. By default
       the commands present data for all pmd threads in the datapath. By
       specifying the "-pmd Core" option one can filter the output for a
       single pmd in the datapath.

       <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-show </b>[<b>-pmd </b><i>core</i>] [<i>dp</i>]
              Shows performance statistics for one or all pmd threads of
              the datapath <i>dp</i>. The special thread "main" sums up the
              statistics of every non pmd thread.

              The sum of "phwol hits", "simple match hits", "emc hits",
              "smc hits", "megaflow hits" and "miss" is the number of
              packet lookups performed by the datapath. Beware that a
              recirculated packet experiences one additional lookup per
              recirculation, so there may be more lookups than forwarded
              packets in the datapath.

              The MFEX Opt hits displays the number of packets that are
              processed by the optimized miniflow extract
              implementations.

              Cycles are counted using the TSC or similar facilities
              (when available on the platform). The duration of one
              cycle depends on the processing platform.

              "idle cycles" refers to cycles spent in PMD iterations not
              forwarding any any packets. "processing cycles" refers to
              cycles spent in PMD iterations forwarding at least one
              packet, including the cost for polling, processing and
              transmitting said packets.

              To reset these counters use <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-clear</b>.

       <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-clear </b>[<i>dp</i>]

              Here "Rx packets" actually reflects the number of packets
              forwarded by the datapath. "Datapath passes" matches the
              number of packet lookups as reported by the <b>dpif-</b>
              <b>netdev/pmd-stats-show </b>command.

              To reset the counters and start a new measurement use
              <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-clear</b>.

       <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-perf-log-set on</b>|<b>off </b>[<b>-b </b><i>before</i>] [<b>-a </b><i>after</i>]
       [<b>-e</b>|<b>-ne</b>] [<b>-us </b><i>usec</i>] [<b>-q </b><i>qlen</i>]
              The userspace "netdev" datapath is able to supervise the
              PMD performance metrics and detect iterations with
              suspicious statistics according to the following criteria:

              —      The iteration lasts longer than <i>usec</i> microseconds
                     (default 250).  This can be used to capture events
                     where a PMD is blocked or interrupted for such a
                     period of time that there is a risk for dropped
                     packets on any of its Rx queues.

              —      The max vhost qlen exceeds a threshold <i>qlen</i>
                     (default 128). This can be used to infer virtio
                     queue overruns and dropped packets inside a VM,
                     which are not visible in OVS otherwise.

              Such suspicious iterations can be logged together with
              their iteration statistics in the <b>ovs-vswitchd.log </b>to be
              able to correlate them to packet drop or other events
              outside OVS.

              The above command enables (<b>on</b>) or disables (<b>off</b>)
              supervision and logging at run-time and can be used to
              adjust the above thresholds for detecting suspicious
              iterations. By default supervision and logging is
              disabled.

              The command options are:

              <b>-b </b><i>before</i>
                     The number of iterations before the suspicious
                     iteration to be logged (default 5).

              <b>-a </b><i>after</i>
                     The number of iterations after the suspicious
                     iteration to be logged (default 5).

              <b>-e     </b>Extend logging interval if another suspicious
                     iteration is detected before logging occurs.

              <b>-ne    </b>Do not extend logging interval if another
                     suspicious iteration is detected before logging
                     occurs (default).

              <b>-q </b><i>qlen</i>
                     Suspicious vhost queue fill level threshold.
                     Increase this to 512 if the Qemu supports 1024
                     virtio queue length (default 128).

              <b>-us </b><i>usec</i>
                     Change the duration threshold for a suspicious
                     iteration (default 250 us).

       Note: Logging of suspicious iterations itself consumes a
       considerable amount of processing cycles of a PMD which may be
       visible in the iteration history.  In the worst case this can
       lead OVS to detect another suspicious iteration caused by
       logging.

       If more than 100 iterations around a suspicious iteration have
       been logged once, OVS falls back to the safe default values (-b 5
       -a 5 -ne) to avoid that logging itself continuously causes
       logging of further suspicious iterations.

       <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-rxq-show </b>[<b>-pmd </b><i>core</i>] [<i>dp</i>]

       <b>dpif-netdev/bond-show </b>[<i>dp</i>]
              When "other_config:lb-output-action" is set to "true", the
              userspace datapath handles the load balancing of bonds
              directly instead of depending on flow recirculation (only
              in balance-tcp mode).

              When this is the case, the above command prints the load-
              balancing information of the bonds configured in datapath
              <i>dp</i> showing the interface associated with each bucket
              (hash).

       <b>dpif-netdev/subtable-lookup-prio-get</b>
              Lists the DPCLS implementations or lookup functions that
              are available as well as their priorities.

       <b>dpif-netdev/subtable-lookup-prio-set </b><i>lookup_function prio</i>
              Sets the priority of a lookup function by name,
              <i>lookup_function</i>, and priority, <i>prio</i>, which should be a
              positive integer value.  The highest priority lookup
              function is used for classification.

              The number of affected dpcls ports and subtables is
              returned.

       <b>dpif-netdev/dpif-impl-get</b>
              Lists the DPIF implementations that are available.

       <b>dpif-netdev/dpif-impl-set </b><i>dpif_impl</i>
              Sets the DPIF to be used to <i>dpif_impl</i>. By default
              "dpif_scalar" is used.

       <b>dpif-netdev/miniflow-parser-get</b>
              Lists the miniflow extract implementations that are

              Sets the miniflow extract to <i>miniflow_impl</i> for a specified
              PMD or all PMDs in the case where no value is specified.
              By default "scalar" is used.  <i>study_cnt</i> defaults to 128
              and indicates the number of packets that the "study"
              miniflow implementation must parse before choosing an
              optimal implementation.

   <b>DPIF-NETLINK COMMANDS</b>
       These commands are used to expose internal information of the
       "dpif-netlink" kernel space datapath.

       <b>dpif-netlink/dispatch-mode</b>
              Displays the "dispatch-mode" for all datapaths.

   <b>NETDEV-DPDK COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage DPDK related ports (<b>type=</b><i>dpdk*</i>).

       <b>netdev-dpdk/set-admin-state </b>[<i>interface</i>] <b>up </b>| <b>down</b>
              Change the admin state for DPDK <i>interface</i> to <b>up </b>or <b>down</b>.
              If <i>interface</i> is not specified, then it applies to all DPDK
              ports.

       <b>netdev-dpdk/detach </b><i>pci-address</i>
              Detaches device with corresponding <i>pci-address</i> from DPDK.
              This command can be used to detach device if it wasn't
              detached automatically after port deletion. Refer to the
              documentation for details and instructions.

       <b>netdev-dpdk/get-mempool-info </b>[<i>interface</i>]
              Prints the debug information about memory pool used by
              DPDK <i>interface</i>.  If called without arguments, information
              of all the available mempools will be printed. For
              additional mempool statistics enable
              <b>CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_MEMPOOL_DEBUG </b>while building DPDK.

   <b>ODP-EXECUTE COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage the "odp-execute" component.

       <b>odp-execute/action-impl-show</b>
              Lists the actions implementations that are available and
              highlights the currently enabled one.

       <b>odp-execute/action-impl-set </b><i>action_impl</i>
              Sets the action implementation to any available
              implementation. By default "scalar" is used.

   <b>DATAPATH DEBUGGING COMMANDS</b>
       These commands query and modify datapaths.  They are are similar
       to <a href="ovs-dpctl.8.html">ovs-dpctl(8)</a> commands.  <b>dpif/show </b>has the additional
       functionality, beyond <b>dpctl/show </b>of printing OpenFlow port
       numbers.  The other commands are redundant and will be removed in
       a future release.

       <b>dpif/dump-dps</b>
              Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate
              line.

       <b>dpif/show</b>
              Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including
              statistics and a list of connected ports.  The port
              information includes the OpenFlow port number, datapath
              port number, and the type.  (The local port is identified
              as OpenFlow port 65534.)

       <b>dpif/dump-flows </b>[<b>-m</b>] <i>dp</i>
              Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath <i>dp</i>'s
              flow table. Without <b>-m</b>, output omits match fields that a
              flow wildcards entirely; with <b>-m </b>output includes all
              wildcarded fields.

              This command is primarily useful for debugging Open
              vSwitch.  The flow table entries that it displays are not
              OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are different and
              considerably simpler flows maintained by the datapath
              module.  If you wish to see the OpenFlow flow entries, use
              <b>ovs-ofctl dump-flows</b>.

       <b>dpif/del-flows </b><i>dp</i>
              Deletes all flow entries from datapath <i>dp</i>'s flow table and
              underlying datapath implementation (e.g., kernel datapath
              module).

              This command is primarily useful for debugging Open
              vSwitch.  As discussed in <b>dpif/dump-flows</b>, these entries
              are not OpenFlow flow entries.

   <b>OFPROTO COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage the core OpenFlow switch implementation
       (called <b>ofproto</b>).

       <b>ofproto/list</b>
              Lists the names of the running ofproto instances.  These
              are the names that may be used on <b>ofproto/trace</b>.

       <b>ofproto/trace </b>[<i>options</i>] [<i>dpname</i>] <i>odp_flow</i> [<i>packet</i>]
       <b>ofproto/trace </b>[<i>options</i>] <i>bridge br_flow</i> [<i>packet</i>]]
       <b>ofproto/trace-packet-out </b>[<i>options</i>] [<i>dpname</i>] <i>odp_flow</i> [<i>packet</i>]
       <i>actions</i>
       <b>ofproto/trace-packet-out </b>[<i>options</i>] <i>bridge br_flow</i> [<i>packet</i>]
       <i>actions</i>
              Traces the path of an imaginary packet through <i>switch</i> and
              reports the path that it took.  The initial treatment of
              the packet varies based on the command:

              •      <b>ofproto/trace </b>looks the packet up in the OpenFlow
                     flow table, as if the packet had arrived on an
                     OpenFlow port.

              •      <b>ofproto/trace-packet-out </b>applies the specified
                     OpenFlow <i>actions</i>, as if the packet, flow, and
                     actions had been specified in an OpenFlow ``packet-
                     out'' request.

              The packet's headers (e.g. source and destination) and
              metadata (e.g. input port), together called its ``flow,''
              are usually all that matter for the purpose of tracing a
              packet.  You can specify the flow in the following ways:

              <i>dpname odp_flow</i>
                     <i>odp_flow</i> is a flow in the form printed by
                     <a href="ovs-dpctl.8.html">ovs-dpctl(8)</a>'s <b>dump-flows </b>command.  If all of your
                     bridges have the same type, which is the common
                     case, then you can omit <i>dpname</i>, but if you have
                     bridges of different types (say, both <b>ovs-netdev</b>
                     and <b>ovs-system</b>), then you need to specify a <i>dpname</i>
                     to disambiguate.

              <i>bridge br_flow</i>
                     <i>br_flow</i> is a flow in the form similar to that
                     accepted by <a href="ovs-ofctl.8.html">ovs-ofctl(8)</a>'s <b>add-flow </b>command.  (This
                     is not an OpenFlow flow: besides other differences,
                     it never contains wildcards.)  <i>bridge</i> names of the
                     bridge through which <i>br_flow</i> should be traced.

              These commands support the following options:

              <b>--generate</b>
                     Generate a packet from the flow (see below for more
                     information).

              <b>--l7 </b><i>payload</i>
              <b>--l7-len </b><i>length</i>
                     Accepted only with <b>--generate </b>(see below for more
                     information).

              <b>--consistent</b>
                     Accepted by <b>ofproto-trace-packet-out </b>only.  With
                     this option, the command rejects <i>actions</i> that are
                     inconsistent with the specified packet.  (An
                     example of an inconsistency is attempting to strip
                     the VLAN tag from a packet that does not have a
                     VLAN tag.)  Open vSwitch ignores most forms of
                     inconsistency in OpenFlow 1.0 and rejects
                     inconsistencies in later versions of OpenFlow.  The
                     option is necessary because the command does not
                     ordinarily imply a particular OpenFlow version.
                     One exception is that, when <i>actions</i> includes an
                     action that only OpenFlow 1.1 and later supports
                     (such as <b>push_vlan</b>), <b>--consistent </b>is automatically
                     enabled.

              <b>--ct-next </b><i>flags</i>
                     When the traced flow triggers conntrack actions,
                     <b>ofproto/trace </b>will automatically trace the forked
                     packet processing pipeline with user specified
                     ct_state.  This option sets the ct_state flags that
                     the conntrack module will report. The <i>flags</i> must be
                     a comma- or space-separated list of the following
                     connection tracking flags:

                     •      <b>trk</b>: Include to indicate connection tracking
                            has taken place.

                     •      <b>new</b>: Include to indicate a new flow.

                     •      <b>est</b>: Include to indicate an established
                            flow.

                     •      <b>rel</b>: Include to indicate a related flow.

                     •      <b>rpl</b>: Include to indicate a reply flow.

                     •      <b>inv</b>: Include to indicate a connection entry
                            in a bad state.

                     •      <b>dnat</b>: Include to indicate a packet whose
                            destination IP address has been changed.

                     •      <b>snat</b>: Include to indicate a packet whose
                            source IP address has been changed.

                     When <b>--ct-next </b>is unspecified, or when there are
                     fewer <b>--ct-next </b>options than ct <i>actions</i>, the <i>flags</i>
                     default to <b>trk,new</b>.

              Most commonly, one specifies only a flow, using one of the
              forms above, but sometimes one might need to specify an
              actual packet instead of just a flow:

              Side effects.
                     Some actions have side effects.  For example, the
                     <b>normal </b>action can update the MAC learning table,
                     and the <b>learn </b>action can change OpenFlow tables.
                     The trace commands only perform side effects when a
                     packet is specified.  If you want side effects to
                     take place, then you must supply a packet.

                     (Output actions are obviously side effects too, but
                     the trace commands never execute them, even when
                     one specifies a packet.)

              Incomplete information.
                     Most of the time, Open vSwitch can figure out
                     everything about the path of a packet using just
                     the flow, but in some special circumstances it
                     needs to look at parts of the packet that are not
                     included in the flow.  When this is the case, and
                     you do not supply a packet, then a trace command
                     will tell you it needs a packet.

              If you wish to include a packet as part of a trace
              operation, there are two ways to do it:

              <b>--generate</b>
                     This option, added to one of the ways to specify a
                     flow already described, causes Open vSwitch to
                     internally generate a packet with the flow
                     described and then to use that packet.  If your
                     goal is to execute side effects, then <b>--generate </b>is
                     the easiest way to do it, but <b>--generate </b>is not a
                     good way to fill in incomplete information, because
                     it generates packets based on only the flow
                     information, which means that the packets really do
                     not have any more information than the flow.

                     By default, for protocols that allow arbitrary L7
                     payloads, the generated packet has 64 bytes of
                     payload.  Use <b>--l7-len </b>to change the payload
                     length, or <b>--l7 </b>to specify the exact contents of
                     the payload.

              <i>packet</i> This form supplies an explicit <i>packet</i> as a sequence
                     of hex digits.  An Ethernet frame is at least 14
                     bytes long, so there must be at least 28 hex
                     digits.  Obviously, it is inconvenient to type in
                     the hex digits by hand, so the <a href="../man1/ovs-pcap.1.html">ovs-pcap(1)</a> and
                     <a href="../man1/ovs-tcpundump.1.html">ovs-tcpundump(1)</a> utilities provide easier ways.

                     With this form, packet headers are extracted
                     directly from <i>packet</i>, so the <i>odp_flow</i> or <i>br_flow</i>
                     should specify only metadata. The metadata can be:

                     <i>skb_priority</i>
                            Packet QoS priority.

                     <i>pkt_mark</i>
                            Mark of the packet.

                     <i>ct_state</i>
                            Connection state of the packet.

                     <i>ct_zone</i>
                            Connection tracking zone for packet.

                     <i>ct_mark</i>
                            Connection mark of the packet.

                     <i>ct_label</i>
                            Connection label of the packet.

                     <i>tun_id</i> The tunnel ID on which the packet arrived.

                     <i>in_port</i>
                            The port on which the packet arrived.

              The in_port value is kernel datapath port number for the
              first format and OpenFlow port number for the second
              format. The numbering of these two types of port usually
              differs and there is no relationship.

       Usage examples:

           <b>Trace an unicast ICMP echo request on ingress port 1 to</b>
           <b>destination MAC 00:00:5E:00:53:01</b>
               ofproto/trace br in_port=1,icmp,icmp_type=8,\
               dl_dst=00:00:5E:00:53:01

           <b>Trace an unicast ICMP echo reply on ingress port 1 to</b>
           <b>destination MAC 00:00:5E:00:53:01</b>
               ofproto/trace br in_port=1,icmp,icmp_type=0,\
               dl_dst=00:00:5E:00:53:01

           <b>Trace an ARP request on ingress port 1</b>
               ofproto/trace br in_port=1,arp,arp_op=1

           <b>Trace an ARP reply on ingress port 1</b>
               ofproto/trace br in_port=1,arp,arp_op=2

   <b>VLOG COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s logging settings.

       <b>vlog/set </b>[<i>spec</i>]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any <i>spec</i>, sets the log level
              for every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <i>spec</i>
              is a list of words separated by spaces or commas or
              colons, up to one from each category below:

              •      A valid module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b>
                     command on <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a>, limits the log level
                     change to the specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level
                     change to only to the system log, to the console,
                     or to a file, respectively.

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog </b>is accepted as a word
                     and is only useful along with the <b>--syslog-target</b>
                     option (the word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the
                     log level.  Messages of the given severity or
                     higher will be logged, and messages of lower
                     severity will be filtered out.  <b>off </b>filters out all
                     messages.  See <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a definition of
                     each log level.

              Case is not significant within <i>spec</i>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a
              file will not take place unless <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>was invoked
              with the <b>--log-file </b>option.

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any </b>is
              accepted as a word but has no effect.

       <b>vlog/set PATTERN:</b><i>destination</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
              Sets the log pattern for <i>destination</i> to <i>pattern</i>.  Refer to
              <a href="ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl(8)</a> for a description of the valid syntax for
              <i>pattern</i>.

       <b>vlog/list</b>
              Lists the supported logging modules and their current
              levels.

       <b>vlog/list-pattern</b>
              Lists logging patterns used for each destination.

       <b>vlog/close</b>
              Causes <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>to close its log file, if it is open.
              (Use <b>vlog/reopen </b>to reopen it later.)

       <b>vlog/reopen</b>
              Causes <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>to close its log file, if it is open,
              and then reopen it.  (This is useful after rotating log
              files, to cause a new log file to be used.)

              This has no effect unless <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>was invoked with
              the <b>--log-file </b>option.

       <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit </b>[<i>module</i>]...
       <b>vlog/enable-rate-limit </b>[<i>module</i>]...
              By default, <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>limits the rate at which certain
              messages can be logged.  When a message would appear more
              frequently than the limit, it is suppressed.  This saves
              disk space, makes logs easier to read, and speeds up
              execution, but occasionally troubleshooting requires more
              detail.  Therefore, <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit </b>allows rate
              limits to be disabled at the level of an individual log
              module.  Specify one or more module names, as displayed by
              the <b>vlog/list </b>command.  Specifying either no module names
              at all or the keyword <b>any </b>disables rate limits for every
              log module.

              The <b>vlog/enable-rate-limit </b>command, whose syntax is the
              same as <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit</b>, can be used to re-enable
              a rate limit that was previously disabled.

   <b>MEMORY COMMANDS</b>
       These commands report memory usage.

       <b>memory/show</b>
              Displays some basic statistics about <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s memory
              usage.  <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>also logs this information soon after
              startup and periodically as its memory consumption grows.

   <b>COVERAGE COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s ``coverage counters,'' which
       count the number of times particular events occur during a
       daemon's runtime.  In addition to these commands, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
       automatically logs coverage counter values, at <b>INFO </b>level, when
       it detects that the daemon's main loop takes unusually long to
       run.

       Coverage counters are useful mainly for performance analysis and
       debugging.

       <b>coverage/show</b>
              Displays the averaged per-second rates for the last few
              seconds, the last minute and the last hour, and the total
              counts of all of the coverage counters.

       <b>coverage/read-counter </b><i>counter</i>
              Displays the total count for the given coverage <i>counter</i>.

   <b>OPENVSWITCH TUNNELING COMMANDS</b>
       These commands query and modify OVS tunnel components.

       <b>ovs/route/add </b><i>ip</i><b>/</b><i>plen output_bridge</i> <b>[</b><i>gw</i><b>] [pkt_mark=</b><i>mark</i><b>]</b>
       <b>[src=</b><i>src_ip</i><b>]</b>
              Adds <i>ip</i>/<i>plen</i> route to vswitchd routing table.
              <i>output_bridge</i> needs to be OVS bridge name.  This command
              is useful if OVS cached routes does not look right.

       <b>ovs/route/show</b>
              Print all routes in OVS routing table, This includes
              routes cached from system routing table and user
              configured routes.

       <b>ovs/route/del ip/plen [pkt_mark=mark]</b>
              Delete ip/plen route from OVS routing table.

       <b>tnl/neigh/show</b>

       <b>tnl/arp/show</b>
              OVS builds ARP cache by snooping are messages. This
              command shows ARP cache table.

       <b>tnl/neigh/set </b><i>bridge ip mac</i>

       <b>tnl/arp/set </b><i>bridge ip mac</i>
              Adds or modifies an ARP cache entry in <i>bridge</i>, mapping <i>ip</i>
              to <i>mac</i>.

       <b>tnl/neigh/flush</b>

       <b>tnl/arp/flush</b>
              Flush ARP table.

       <b>tnl/neigh/aging [</b><i>seconds</i><b>]</b>

       <b>tnl/arp/aging [</b><i>seconds</i><b>]</b>
              Changes the aging time. The accepted values of <i>seconds</i> are
              between 1 and 3600. The new entries will get the value as
              specified in <i>seconds</i>. For the existing entries, the aging
              time is updated only if the current expiration is greater
              than <i>seconds</i>.

              If used without arguments, it prints the current aging
              value.

       <b>tnl/egress_port_range [num1] [num2]</b>
              Set range for UDP source port used for UDP based Tunnels.
              For example VxLAN. If case of zero arguments this command
              prints current range in use.
</pre> <h2>
OPENFLOW IMPLEMENTATION </h2>
<pre>
       This section documents aspects of OpenFlow for which the OpenFlow
       specification requires documentation.

   <b>Packet buffering.</b>
       The OpenFlow specification, version 1.2, says:

              Switches that implement buffering are expected to expose,
              through documentation, both the amount of available
              buffering, and the length of time before buffers may be
              reused.

       Open vSwitch does not maintains any packet buffers.

   <b>Bundle lifetime</b>
       The OpenFlow specification, version 1.4, says:

              If the switch does not receive any OFPT_BUNDLE_CONTROL or
              OFPT_BUNDLE_ADD_MESSAGE message for an opened bundle_id
              for a switch defined time greater than 1s, it may send an
              ofp_error_msg with OFPET_BUNDLE_FAILED type and
              OFPBFC_TIMEOUT code.  If the switch does not receive any
              new message in a bundle apart from echo request and
              replies for a switch defined time greater than 1s, it may
              send an ofp_error_msg with OFPET_BUNDLE_FAILED type and
              OFPBFC_TIMEOUT code.

       Open vSwitch implements default idle bundle lifetime of 10
       seconds.  (This is configurable via <b>other-config:bundle-idle-</b>
       <b>timeout </b>in the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table. See <a href="../man5/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</a>
       for details.)
</pre> <h2>
LIMITS </h2>
<pre>
       We believe these limits to be accurate as of this writing.  These
       limits assume the use of the Linux kernel datapath.

       •      <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>started through <a href="ovs-ctl.8.html">ovs-ctl(8)</a> provides a limit
              of 65535 file descriptors.  The limits on the number of
              bridges and ports is decided by the availability of file
              descriptors.  With the Linux kernel datapath, creation of
              a single bridge consumes three file descriptors and each
              port consumes one additional file descriptor.  Other
              platforms may have different limitations.

       •      8,192 MAC learning entries per bridge, by default.  (This
              is configurable via <b>other-config:mac-table-size </b>in the
              <b>Bridge </b>table.  See <a href="../man5/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</a> for details.)

       •      Kernel flows are limited only by memory available to the
              kernel.  Performance will degrade beyond 1,048,576 kernel
              flows per bridge with a 32-bit kernel, beyond 262,144 with
              a 64-bit kernel.  (<b>ovs-vswitchd </b>should never install
              anywhere near that many flows.)

       •      OpenFlow flows are limited only by available memory.
              Performance is linear in the number of unique wildcard
              patterns.  That is, an OpenFlow table that contains many
              flows that all match on the same fields in the same way
              has a constant-time lookup, but a table that contains many
              flows that match on different fields requires lookup time
              linear in the number of flows.

       •      255 ports per bridge participating in 802.1D Spanning Tree
              Protocol.

       •      32 mirrors per bridge.

       •      15 bytes for the name of a port, for ports implemented in
              the Linux kernel.  Ports implemented in userspace, such as
              patch ports, do not have an arbitrary length limitation.
              OpenFlow also limit port names to 15 bytes.
