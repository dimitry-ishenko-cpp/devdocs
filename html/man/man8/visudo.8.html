NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>visudo </b>— edit the sudoers file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>visudo </b>[<b>-chIOPqsV</b>] [[<b>-f</b>] <i>sudoers</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>visudo </b>edits the <i>sudoers</i> file in a safe fashion, analogous to
       <i>vipw</i>(8).  <b>visudo </b>locks the <i>sudoers</i> file against multiple
       simultaneous edits, performs basic validity checks, and checks
       for syntax errors before installing the edited file.  If the
       <i>sudoers</i> file is currently being edited you will receive a message
       to try again later.

       If the <i>sudoers</i> file does not exist, it will be created unless the
       editor exits without writing to the file.

       <b>visudo </b>parses the <i>sudoers</i> file after editing and will not save
       the changes if there is a syntax error.  Upon finding an error,
       <b>visudo </b>will print a message stating the line number(s) where the
       error occurred and the user will receive the “What now?” prompt.
       At this point the user may enter ‘e’ to re-edit the <i>sudoers</i> file,
       ‘x’ to exit without saving the changes, or ‘Q’ to quit and save
       changes.  The ‘Q’ option should be used with extreme caution
       because if <b>visudo </b>believes there to be a syntax error, so will
       <b>sudo</b>.  If ‘e’ is typed to edit the <i>sudoers</i> file after a syntax
       error has been detected, the cursor will be placed on the line
       where the error occurred (if the editor supports this feature).

       There are two <i>sudoers</i> settings that determine which editor <b>visudo</b>
       will run.

       editor      A colon (‘:’) separated list of editors allowed to be
                   used with <b>visudo</b>.  <b>visudo </b>will choose the editor that
                   matches the user's SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, or EDITOR
                   environment variable if possible, or the first editor
                   in the list that exists and is executable.  <b>sudo </b>does
                   not preserve the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, or EDITOR
                   environment variables unless they are present in the
                   <i>env_keep</i> list or the <i>env_reset</i> option is disabled in
                   the <i>sudoers</i> file.  The default editor path is
                   <i>/usr/bin/vi</i> which can be set at compile time via the
                   <b>--with-editor </b>configure option.

       env_editor  If set, <b>visudo </b>will use the value of the SUDO_EDITOR,
                   VISUAL, or EDITOR environment variables before
                   falling back on the default editor list.  <b>visudo </b>is
                   typically run as root so this option may allow a user
                   with <b>visudo </b>privileges to run arbitrary commands as
                   root without logging.  An alternative is to place a
                   colon-separated list of “safe” editors in the <i>editor</i>
                   variable.  <b>visudo </b>will then only use SUDO_EDITOR,
                   VISUAL, or EDITOR if they match a value specified in
                   <i>editor</i>.  If the <i>env_reset</i> flag is enabled, the
                   SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and/or EDITOR environment
                   variables must be present in the <i>env_keep</i> list for
                   the <i>env_editor</i> flag to function when <b>visudo </b>is
                   invoked via <b>sudo</b>.  The default value is <i>on</i>, which can
                   be set at compile time via the <b>--with-env-editor</b>
                   configure option.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--check</b>
               Enable <i>check-only</i> mode.  The existing <i>sudoers</i> file (and
               any other files it includes) will be checked for syntax
               errors.  If the path to the <i>sudoers</i> file was not
               specified, <b>visudo </b>will also check the file ownership and
               permissions (see the <b>-O </b>and <b>-P </b>options).  A message will
               be printed to the standard output describing the status
               of <i>sudoers</i> unless the <b>-q </b>option was specified.  If the
               check completes successfully, <b>visudo </b>will exit with a
               value of 0.  If an error is encountered, <b>visudo </b>will exit
               with a value of 1.

       <b>-f </b><i>sudoers</i>, <b>--file</b>=<i>sudoers</i>
               Specify an alternate <i>sudoers</i> file location, see below.
               As of version 1.8.27, the <i>sudoers</i> path can be specified
               without using the <b>-f </b>option.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               Display a short help message to the standard output and
               exit.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--no-includes</b>
               Disable the editing of include files unless there is a
               pre-existing syntax error.  By default, <b>visudo </b>will edit
               the main <i>sudoers</i> file and any files included via <i>@include</i>
               or <i>#include</i> directives.  Files included via <i>@includedir</i>
               or <i>#includedir</i> are never edited unless they contain a
               syntax error.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--owner</b>
               Enforce the default ownership (user and group) of the
               <i>sudoers</i> file.  In edit mode, the owner of the edited file
               will be set to the default.  In check mode (<b>-c</b>), an error
               will be reported if the owner is incorrect.  This option
               is enabled by default if the <i>sudoers</i> file was not
               specified.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--perms</b>
               Enforce the default permissions (mode) of the <i>sudoers</i>
               file.  In edit mode, the permissions of the edited file
               will be set to the default.  In check mode (<b>-c</b>), an error
               will be reported if the file permissions are incorrect.
               This option is enabled by default if the <i>sudoers</i> file was
               not specified.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
               Enable <i>quiet</i> mode.  In this mode details about syntax
               errors are not printed.  This option is only useful when
               combined with the <b>-c </b>option.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--strict</b>
               Enable <i>strict</i> checking of the <i>sudoers</i> file.  If an alias
               is referenced but not actually defined or if there is a
               cycle in an alias, <b>visudo </b>will consider this a syntax
               error.  It is not possible to differentiate between an
               alias and a host name or user name that consists solely
               of uppercase letters, digits, and the underscore (‘_’)
               character.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Print the <b>visudo </b>and <i>sudoers</i> grammar versions and exit.

       A <i>sudoers</i> file may be specified instead of the default,
       <i>/etc/sudoers</i>.  The temporary file used is the specified <i>sudoers</i>
       file with “.tmp” appended to it.  In <i>check-only</i> mode only, ‘-’
       may be used to indicate that <i>sudoers</i> will be read from the
       standard input.  Because the policy is evaluated in its entirety,
       it is not sufficient to check an individual <i>sudoers</i> include file
       for syntax errors.

   <b>Debugging and sudoers plugin arguments</b>
       <b>visudo </b>versions 1.8.4 and higher support a flexible debugging
       framework that is configured via <i>Debug</i> lines in the <i>sudo.conf</i>(5)
       file.

       Starting with <b>sudo </b>1.8.12, <b>visudo </b>will also parse the arguments
       to the <i>sudoers</i> plugin to override the default <i>sudoers</i> path name,
       user-ID, group-ID, and file mode.  These arguments, if present,
       should be listed after the path to the plugin (i.e., after
       <i>sudoers.so</i>).  Multiple arguments may be specified, separated by
       white space.  For example:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so sudoers_mode=0400

       The following arguments are supported:

       sudoers_file=pathname
             The <i>sudoers_file</i> argument can be used to override the
             default path to the <i>sudoers</i> file.

       sudoers_uid=user-ID
             The <i>sudoers_uid</i> argument can be used to override the
             default owner of the sudoers file.  It should be specified
             as a numeric user-ID.

       sudoers_gid=group-ID
             The <i>sudoers_gid</i> argument can be used to override the
             default group of the sudoers file.  It must be specified as
             a numeric group-ID (not a group name).

       sudoers_mode=mode
             The <i>sudoers_mode</i> argument can be used to override the
             default file mode for the sudoers file.  It should be
             specified as an octal value.

       For more information on configuring <i>sudo.conf</i>(5), refer to its
       manual.

ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables may be consulted depending on
       the value of the <i>editor</i> and <i>env_editor sudoers</i> settings:

       SUDO_EDITOR      Invoked by <b>visudo </b>as the editor to use

       VISUAL           Used by <b>visudo </b>if SUDO_EDITOR is not set

       EDITOR           Used by <b>visudo </b>if neither SUDO_EDITOR nor VISUAL
                        is set
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/sudo.conf</i>            Sudo front-end configuration

       <i>/etc/sudoers</i>              List of who can run what

       <i>/etc/sudoers.tmp</i>          Default temporary file used by visudo
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to reporting <i>sudoers</i> syntax errors, <b>visudo </b>may
       produce the following messages:

       <b>sudoers file busy, try again later.</b>
             Someone else is currently editing the <i>sudoers</i> file.

       <b>/etc/sudoers: Permission denied</b>
             You didn't run <b>visudo </b>as root.

       <b>you do not exist in the passwd database</b>
             Your user-ID does not appear in the system passwd database.

       <b>Warning: {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias referenced but not defined</b>
             Either you are trying to use an undeclared
             {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias or you have a user or host
             name listed that consists solely of uppercase letters,
             digits, and the underscore (‘_’) character.  In the latter
             case, you can ignore the warnings (<b>sudo </b>will not complain).
             The message is prefixed with the path name of the <i>sudoers</i>
             file and the line number where the undefined alias was
             used.  In <b>-s </b>(strict) mode these are errors, not warnings.

       <b>Warning: unused {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias</b>
             The specified {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias was defined but
             never used.  The message is prefixed with the path name of
             the <i>sudoers</i> file and the line number where the unused alias
             was defined.  You may wish to comment out or remove the
             unused alias.

       <b>Warning: cycle in {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias</b>
             The specified {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias includes a
             reference to itself, either directly or through an alias it
             includes.  The message is prefixed with the path name of
             the <i>sudoers</i> file and the line number where the cycle was
             detected.  This is only a warning unless <b>visudo </b>is run in
             <b>-s </b>(strict) mode as <b>sudo </b>will ignore cycles when parsing
             the <i>sudoers</i> file.

       <b>ignoring editor backup file</b>
             While processing a <i>@includedir</i> or <i>#includedir</i>, a file was
             found with a name that ends in ‘~’ or <i>.bak</i>.  Such files are
             skipped by <b>sudo </b>and <b>visudo</b>.

       <b>ignoring file name containing '.'</b>
             While processing a <i>@includedir</i> or <i>#includedir</i>, a file was
             found with a name that contains a ‘.’ character.  Such
             files are skipped by <b>sudo </b>and <b>visudo</b>.

       <b>unknown defaults entry "name"</b>
             The <i>sudoers</i> file contains a <i>Defaults</i> setting not recognized
             by <b>visudo</b>.
