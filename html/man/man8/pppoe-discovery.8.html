NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pppoe-discovery - perform PPPoE discovery
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pppoe-discovery </b>[ <i>options</i> ]
       <b>pppoe-discovery </b>{ <b>-V </b>| <b>-h </b>}
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pppoe-discovery </b>performs the same discovery process as <b>pppoe</b>, but
       does not initiate a session.  It sends a PADI packet and then
       prints the names of access concentrators in each PADO packet it
       receives.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-I </b><i>interface</i>
              The <b>-I </b>option specifies the Ethernet interface to use.
              Under Linux, it is typically eth0 or eth1.  The interface
              should be “up” before you start <b>pppoe-discovery</b>, but
              should <i>not</i> be configured to have an IP address.  This
              option is mandatory.

       <b>-D </b><i>file_name</i>
              The <b>-D </b>option causes every packet to be dumped to the
              specified <i>file_name</i>.  This is intended for debugging only.

       <b>-U</b>
              Causes <b>pppoe-discovery </b>to use the Host-Uniq tag in its
              discovery packets.  This lets you run multiple instances
              of <b>pppoe-discovery </b>and/or <b>pppoe </b>without having their
              discovery packets interfere with one another.  You must
              supply this option to <i>all</i> instances that you intend to run
              simultaneously.

       <b>-S </b><i>service_name</i>
              Specifies the desired service name.  <b>pppoe-discovery </b>will
              only accept access concentrators which can provide the
              specified service.  In most cases, you should <i>not</i> specify
              this option.  Use it only if you know that there are
              multiple access concentrators or know that you need a
              specific service name.

       <b>-C </b><i>ac_name</i>
              Specifies the desired access concentrator name.
              <b>pppoe-discovery </b>will only accept the specified access
              concentrator.  In most cases, you should <i>not</i> specify this
              option.  Use it only if you know that there are multiple
              access concentrators.  If both the <b>-S </b>and <b>-C </b>options are
              specified, they must <i>both</i> match.

       <b>-A</b>
              This option is accepted for compatibility with <b>pppoe</b>, but
              has no effect.

       <b>-V </b>| <b>-h</b>
              Either of these options causes <b>pppoe-discovery </b>to print
              its version number and usage information, then exit.
