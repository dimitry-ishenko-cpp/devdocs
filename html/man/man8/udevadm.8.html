DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>udevadm </b>expects a command and command specific options. It
       controls the runtime behavior of <b>systemd-udevd</b>, requests kernel
       events, manages the event queue, and provides simple debugging
       mechanisms.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
           Print debug messages to standard error. This option is
           implied in <b>udevadm test </b>and <b>udevadm test-builtin </b>commands.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

   <b>udevadm info [<i>options</i></b>] [<i><b>devpath</b></i>|<i><b>file</b></i>|<i><b>unit</b></i>]
       Query the udev database for device information.

       Positional arguments should be used to specify one or more
       devices. Each one may be a device name (in which case it must
       start with /dev/), a sys path (in which case it must start with
       /sys/), or a systemd device unit name (in which case it must end
       with ".device", see <a href="../man5/systemd.device.5.html">systemd.device(5)</a>).

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--query=</b><i>TYPE</i>
           Query the database for the specified type of device data.
           Valid <i>TYPE</i>s are: <b>name</b>, <b>symlink</b>, <b>path</b>, <b>property</b>, <b>all</b>.

       <b>--property=</b><i>NAME</i>
           When showing device properties using the <b>--query=property</b>
           option, limit display to properties specified in the
           argument. The argument should be a comma-separated list of
           property names. If not specified, all known properties are
           shown.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--value</b>
           When showing device properties using the <b>--query=property</b>
           option, print only their values, and skip the property name
           and "=".

           Cannot be used together with <b>-x/--export </b>or
           <b>-P/--export-prefix</b>.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--path=</b><i>DEVPATH</i>
           The /sys/ path of the device to query, e.g.
           [/sys/]/class/block/sda. This option is an alternative to the
           positional argument with a /sys/ prefix.  <b>udevadm info</b>
           <b>--path=/class/block/sda </b>is equivalent to <b>udevadm info</b>
           <b>/sys/class/block/sda</b>.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--name=</b><i>FILE</i>
           The name of the device node or a symlink to query, e.g.
           [/dev/]/sda. This option is an alternative to the positional
           argument with a /dev/ prefix.  <b>udevadm info --name=sda </b>is
           equivalent to <b>udevadm info /dev/sda</b>.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--root</b>
           Print absolute paths in <b>name </b>or <b>symlink </b>query.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--attribute-walk</b>
           Print all sysfs properties of the specified device that can
           be used in udev rules to match the specified device. It
           prints all devices along the chain, up to the root of sysfs
           that can be used in udev rules.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--tree</b>
           Display a sysfs tree. This recursively iterates through the
           sysfs hierarchy and displays it in a tree structure. If a
           path is specified only the subtree below and its parent
           directories are shown. This will show both device and
           subsystem items.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--export</b>
           Print output as key/value pairs. Values are enclosed in
           single quotes. This takes effects only when <b>--query=property</b>
           or <b>--device-id-of-file=</b><i>FILE</i> is specified.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--export-prefix=</b><i>NAME</i>
           Add a prefix to the key name of exported values. This implies
           <b>--export</b>.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device-id-of-file=</b><i>FILE</i>
           Print major/minor numbers of the underlying device, where the
           file lives on. If this is specified, all positional arguments
           are ignored.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--export-db</b>
           Export the content of the udev database.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cleanup-db</b>
           Cleanup the udev database.

       <b>-w[SECONDS]</b>, <b>--wait-for-initialization[=SECONDS]</b>
           Wait for device to be initialized. If argument <i>SECONDS</i> is not
           specified, the default is to wait forever.

           Added in version 243.

       <b>--subsystem-match[=SUBSYSTEM]</b>, <b>--subsystem-nomatch[=SUBSYSTEM]</b>
           When used with <b>--export-db</b>, only show devices of or not of
           the given subsystem respectively.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--attr-match[=FILE[=VALUE]]</b>, <b>--attr-nomatch[=FILE[=VALUE]]</b>
           When used with <b>--export-db</b>, only show devices matching or not
           matching the given attribute respectively.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--property-match[=KEY=VALUE]</b>
           When used with <b>--export-db</b>, only show devices matching the
           given property and value.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--tag-match[=TAG]</b>
           When used with <b>--export-db</b>, only show devices with the given
           tag.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--sysname-match[=NAME]</b>
           When used with <b>--export-db</b>, only show devices with the given
           "/sys" path.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--name-match[=NAME]</b>
           When used with <b>--export-db</b>, only show devices with the given
           name in "/dev".

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--parent-match[=NAME]</b>
           When used with <b>--export-db</b>, only show devices with the given
           parent device.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--initialized-match</b>, <b>--initialized-nomatch</b>
           When used with <b>--export-db</b>, only show devices that are
           initialized or not initialized respectively.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--json=</b><i>MODE</i>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for
           the shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace
           or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same,
           with indentation and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON
           output, the default).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       The generated output shows the current device database entry in a
       terse format. Each line shown is prefixed with one of the
       following characters:

   <b>udevadm trigger [<i>options</i></b>] [<i><b>devpath</b></i>|<i><b>file</b></i>|<i><b>unit</b></i>]
       Request device events from the kernel. Primarily used to replay
       events at system coldplug time.

       Takes device specifications as positional arguments. See the
       description of <b>info </b>above.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print the list of devices which will be triggered.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
           Do not actually trigger the event.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppress error logging in triggering events.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--type=</b><i>TYPE</i>
           Trigger a specific type of devices. Valid types are "all",
           "devices", and "subsystems". The default value is "devices".

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--action=</b><i>ACTION</i>
           Type of event to be triggered. Possible actions are "add",
           "remove", "change", "move", "online", "offline", "bind", and
           "unbind". Also, the special value "help" can be used to list
           the possible actions. The default value is "change".

       <b>--prioritized-subsystem=</b><i>SUBSYSTEM[,SUBSYSTEM</i>...]
           Takes a comma separated list of subsystems. When triggering
           events for devices, the devices from the specified subsystems
           and their parents are triggered first. For example, if
           <b>--prioritized-subsystem=block,net</b>, then firstly all block
           devices and their parents are triggered, in the next all
           network devices and their parents are triggered, and lastly
           the other devices are triggered. This option can be specified
           multiple times, and in that case the lists of the subsystems
           will be merged. That is, <b>--prioritized-subsystem=block</b>
           <b>--prioritized-subsystem=net </b>is equivalent to
           <b>--prioritized-subsystem=block,net</b>.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--subsystem-match=</b><i>SUBSYSTEM</i>
           Trigger events for devices which belong to a matching
           subsystem. This option supports shell style pattern matching.
           When this option is specified more than once, then each
           matching result is ORed, that is, all the devices in each
           subsystem are triggered.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--subsystem-nomatch=</b><i>SUBSYSTEM</i>
           Do not trigger events for devices which belong to a matching
           subsystem. This option supports shell style pattern matching.
           When this option is specified more than once, then each
           matching result is ANDed, that is, devices which do not match
           all specified subsystems are triggered.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--attr-match=</b><i>ATTRIBUTE</i><b>=</b><i>VALUE</i>
           Trigger events for devices with a matching sysfs attribute.
           If a value is specified along with the attribute name, the
           content of the attribute is matched against the given value
           using shell style pattern matching. If no value is specified,
           the existence of the sysfs attribute is checked. When this
           option is specified multiple times, then each matching result
           is ANDed, that is, only devices which have all specified
           attributes are triggered.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--attr-nomatch=</b><i>ATTRIBUTE</i><b>=</b><i>VALUE</i>
           Do not trigger events for devices with a matching sysfs
           attribute. If a value is specified along with the attribute
           name, the content of the attribute is matched against the
           given value using shell style pattern matching. If no value
           is specified, the existence of the sysfs attribute is
           checked. When this option is specified multiple times, then
           each matching result is ANDed, that is, only devices which
           have none of the specified attributes are triggered.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--property-match=</b><i>PROPERTY</i><b>=</b><i>VALUE</i>
           Trigger events for devices with a matching property value.
           This option supports shell style pattern matching. When this
           option is specified more than once, then each matching result
           is ORed, that is, devices which have one of the specified
           properties are triggered.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--tag-match=</b><i>TAG</i>
           Trigger events for devices with a matching tag. When this
           option is specified multiple times, then each matching result
           is ANDed, that is, devices which have all specified tags are
           triggered.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--sysname-match=</b><i>NAME</i>
           Trigger events for devices for which the last component (i.e.
           the filename) of the /sys/ path matches the specified <i>PATH</i>.
           This option supports shell style pattern matching. When this
           option is specified more than once, then each matching result
           is ORed, that is, all devices which have any of the specified
           <i>NAME</i> are triggered.

       <b>--name-match=</b><i>NAME</i>
           Trigger events for devices with a matching device path. When
           this option is specified more than once, then each matching
           result is ORed, that is, all specified devices are triggered.

           Added in version 218.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--parent-match=</b><i>SYSPATH</i>
           Trigger events for all children of a given device. When this
           option is specified more than once, then each matching result
           is ORed, that is, all children of each specified device are
           triggered.

       <b>--initialized-match</b>, <b>--initialized-nomatch</b>
           When <b>--initialized-match </b>is specified, trigger events for
           devices that are already initialized by <b>systemd-udevd</b>, and
           skip devices that are not initialized yet.

           When <b>--initialized-nomatch </b>is specified, trigger events for
           devices that are not initialized by <b>systemd-udevd </b>yet, and
           skip devices that are already initialized.

           Typically, it is essential that applications which intend to
           use such a match, make sure a suitable udev rule is installed
           that sets at least one property on devices that shall be
           matched. See also Initialized Devices section below for more
           details.

               <b>Warning</b>
               <b>--initialized-nomatch </b>can potentially save a significant
               amount of time compared to re-triggering all devices in
               the system and e.g. can be used to optimize boot time.
               However, this is not safe to be used in a boot sequence
               in general. Especially, when udev rules for a device
               depend on its parent devices (e.g.  "ATTRS" or
               "IMPORT{parent}" keys, see <a href="../man7/udev.7.html">udev(7)</a> for more details), the
               final state of the device becomes easily unstable with
               this option.
           Added in version 251.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--settle</b>
           Apart from triggering events, also waits for those events to
           finish. Note that this is different from calling <b>udevadm</b>
           <b>settle</b>.  <b>udevadm settle </b>waits for all events to finish. This
           option only waits for events triggered by the same command to
           finish.

           Added in version 238.

       <b>--uuid</b>
           Trigger the synthetic device events, and associate a
           randomized UUID with each. These UUIDs are printed to
           standard output, one line for each event. These UUIDs are
           included in the uevent environment block (in the
           "SYNTH_UUID=" property) and may be used to track delivery of
           the generated events.

           Added in version 249.

       <b>--wait-daemon[=</b><i>SECONDS</i><b>]</b>
           Before triggering uevents, wait for systemd-udevd daemon to
           be initialized. Optionally takes timeout value. Default
           timeout is 5 seconds. This is equivalent to invoking <b>udevadm</b>
           <b>control --ping </b>before <b>udevadm trigger</b>.

           Added in version 241.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       In addition, optional positional arguments can be used to specify
       device names or sys paths. They must start with /dev/ or /sys/
       respectively.

   <b>udevadm settle [<i>options</i></b>]
       Watches the udev event queue, and exits if all current events are
       handled.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout=</b><i>SECONDS</i>
           Maximum number of seconds to wait for the event queue to
           become empty. The default value is 120 seconds. A value of 0
           will check if the queue is empty and always return
           immediately. A non-zero value will return an exit code of 0
           if queue became empty before timeout was reached, non-zero
           otherwise.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--exit-if-exists=</b><i>FILE</i>
           Stop waiting if file exists.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       See <a href="systemd-udev-settle.service.8.html">systemd-udev-settle.service(8)</a> for more information.

   [1mudevadm control <i>option</i>
       Modify the internal state of the running udev daemon.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--exit</b>
           Signal and wait for systemd-udevd to exit. No option except
           for <b>--timeout </b>can be specified after this option. Note that
           systemd-udevd.service contains <b>Restart=always </b>and so as a
           result, this option restarts systemd-udevd. If you want to
           stop systemd-udevd.service, please use the following:

               systemctl stop systemd-udevd-control.socket systemd-udevd-kernel.socket systemd-udevd.service

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--log-level=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the internal log level of systemd-udevd. Valid values are
           the numerical syslog priorities or their textual
           representations: <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>,

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--start-exec-queue</b>
           Signal systemd-udevd to enable the execution of events.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--reload</b>
           Signal systemd-udevd to reload the rules files and other
           databases like the kernel module index. Reloading rules and
           databases does not apply any changes to already existing
           devices; the new configuration will only be applied to new
           events.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--property=</b><i>KEY</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
           Set a global property for all events.

           Set the maximum number of events, systemd-udevd will handle
           at the same time. When 0 is specified, then the maximum is
           determined based on the system resources.

       <b>--ping</b>
           Send a ping message to systemd-udevd and wait for the reply.
           This may be useful to check that systemd-udevd daemon is
           running.

           Added in version 241.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout=</b><i>seconds</i>
           The maximum number of seconds to wait for a reply from

               These credentials should contain valid <a href="../man5/udev.conf.5.html">udev.conf(5)</a>
               configuration data. From each matching credential a
               separate file is created. Example: a passed credential
               udev.conf.50-foobar will be copied into a configuration
               file /run/udev/udev.conf.d/50-foobar.conf.

               Added in version 256.

       Positional arguments could be used to specify one or more files
       to check. If no files are specified, the udev rules are read from
       the files located in the same udev/rules.d directories that are
       processed by the udev daemon.

       The exit status is <b>0 </b>if all specified udev rules files are

       <b>--no-style</b>
           Ignore style issues. When specified, even if style issues are
           found in udev rules files, the exit status is <b>0 </b>if no

   <b>udevadm wait [<i>options</i></b>] [<i><b>device|syspath</b></i>] ...
       Wait for devices or device symlinks being created and initialized
       by <b>systemd-udevd</b>. Each device path must start with "/dev/" or
       "/sys/", e.g.  "/dev/sda",
       "/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:3c:00.0-nvme-1-part1",
       "/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.6/net/eth0", or
       "/sys/class/net/eth0". This can take multiple devices. This may
       be useful for waiting for devices being processed by
       <b>systemd-udevd </b>after e.g. partitioning or formatting the devices.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout=</b><i>SECONDS</i>
           Maximum number of seconds to wait for the specified devices
           or device symlinks being created, initialized, or removed.
           The default value is "infinity".

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--initialized=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Check if <b>systemd-udevd </b>initialized devices. Defaults to true.
           When false, the command only checks if the specified devices
           exist. Set false to this setting if there is no udev rules
           for the specified devices, as the devices will never be
           considered as initialized in that case. See Initialized
           Devices section below for more details.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--removed</b>
           When specified, the command wait for devices being removed
           instead of created or initialized. If this is specified,
           <b>--initialized= </b>will be ignored.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--settle</b>
           When specified, also watches the udev event queue, and wait
           for all queued events being processed by <b>systemd-udevd</b>.

   <b>udevadm lock [<i>options</i></b>] [<i><b>command</b></i>] ...
       <b>udevadm lock </b>takes an (advisory) exclusive lock on a block device
       (or all specified devices), as per <b>Locking Block Device Access</b>[1]
       and invokes a program with the locks taken. When the invoked
       program exits the locks are automatically released and its return
       value is propagated as exit code of <b>udevadm lock</b>.

       This tool is in particular useful to ensure that
       <a href="systemd-udevd.service.8.html">systemd-udevd.service(8)</a> does not probe a block device while
       changes are made to it, for example partitions created or file
       systems formatted. Note that many tools that interface with block
       devices natively support taking relevant locks, see for example
       <a href="sfdisk.8.html">sfdisk(8)</a>'s <b>--lock </b>switch.

       The command expects at least one block device specified via
       <b>--device= </b>or <b>--backing=</b>, and a command line to execute as
       arguments.

       <b>--device=</b><i>DEVICE</i>, <b>-d </b><i>DEVICE</i>
           Takes a path to a device node of the device to lock. This
           switch may be used multiple times (and in combination with
           <b>--backing=</b>) in order to lock multiple devices. If a partition
           block device node is specified the containing "whole" block
           device is automatically determined and used for the lock, as
           per the specification. If multiple devices are specified,
           they are deduplicated, sorted by the major/minor of their
           device nodes and then locked in order.

           This switch must be used at least once, to specify at least
           one device to lock. (Alternatively, use <b>--backing=</b>, see
           below.)

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--backing=</b><i>PATH</i>, <b>-b </b><i>PATH</i>
           If a path to a device node is specified, identical to
           <b>--device=</b>. However, this switch alternatively accepts a path
           to a regular file or directory, in which case the block
           device of the file system the file/directory resides on is
           automatically determined and used as if it was specified with
           <b>--device=</b>.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--timeout=</b><i>SECS</i>, <b>-t </b><i>SECS</i>
           Specifies how long to wait at most until all locks can be
           taken. Takes a value in seconds, or in the usual supported
           time units, see <a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)</a>. If specified as zero the
           lock is attempted and if not successful the invocation will
           immediately fail. If passed as "infinity" (the default) the
           invocation will wait indefinitely until the lock can be
           acquired. If the lock cannot be taken in the specified time
           the specified command will not be executed and the invocation
           will fail.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--print</b>, <b>-p</b>
           Instead of locking the specified devices and executing a
           command, just print the device paths that would be locked,
           and execute no command. This command is useful to determine
           the "whole" block device in case a partition block device is
           specified. The devices will be sorted by their device node
           major number as primary ordering key and the minor number as
           secondary ordering key (i.e. they are shown in the order
           they'd be locked). Note that the number of lines printed here
           can be less than the number of <b>--device= </b>and <b>--backing=</b>
           switches specified in case these resolve to the same "whole"
           devices.

           Added in version 251.

INITIALIZED DEVICES </h2>
<pre>
       Initialized devices are those for which at least one udev rule
       already completed execution – for any action but "remove" — that
       set a property or other device setting (and thus has an entry in
       the udev device database). Devices are no longer considered
       initialized if a "remove" action is seen for them (which removes
       their entry in the udev device database). Note that devices that
       have no udev rules are never considered initialized, but might
       still be announced via the sd-device API (or similar).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Example 1. Format a File System</b>

       Take a lock on the backing block device while creating a file
       system, to ensure that <b>systemd-udevd </b>doesn't probe or announce
       the new superblock before it is comprehensively written:

           # udevadm lock --device=/dev/sda1 mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1

       <b>Example 2. Format a RAID File System</b>

       Similar, but take locks on multiple devices at once:

           # udevadm lock --device=/dev/sda1 --device=/dev/sdb1 mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1

       <b>Example 3. Copy in a File System</b>

       Take a lock on the backing block device while copying in a
       prepared file system image, to ensure that <b>systemd-udevd </b>doesn't
       probe or announce the new superblock before it is fully written:

           # udevadm lock -d /dev/sda1 dd if=fs.raw of=/dev/sda1
