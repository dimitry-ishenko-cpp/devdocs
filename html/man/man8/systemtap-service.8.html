<pre>
       systemtap-service - SystemTap initscript and systemd service
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemtap-service </b><i>COMMAND</i> [<i>OPTIONS</i>] [<i>SCRIPT</i>...]

       <b>service systemtap </b><i>COMMAND</i> [<i>OPTIONS</i>] [<i>SCRIPT</i>...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The SystemTap initscript aims to provide a way to run scripts as
       a service and easily control them individually. Scripts can be
       configured to start upon manual request, or during system
       startup. On dracut-based systems, it is also possible to
       integrate scripts in the initramfs and have them start during
       early-boot.

       The SystemTap initscript can be invoked manually using the
       <b>systemtap-service </b>command. On systemd-based systems, the
       initscript is controlled by <b>systemctl </b>with the service file
       <b>systemtap.service</b>.

       There are various parameters and options available to modify
       global behaviour, as well as script behaviour. Dependencies
       between scripts can be established so that starting one starts
       others.

       The configuration file of the initscript is located at
       <b>${prefix}/etc/systemtap/config</b>. Acceptable parameters are
       detailed in the GLOBAL PARAMETERS section.

       Scripts must be placed in the <b>${prefix}/etc/systemtap/script.d</b>
       directory and must have a <b>.stp </b>extension. When referring to them
       on the command-line however, there in no need to include the <b>.stp</b>
       extension.  Script names can only contain alphanumeric characters
       (and '_') and must not start with a number. The scripts directory
       may be changed by setting the SCRIPT_PATH parameter in the
       configuration file.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       One of the commands below must be specified:

       <b>start  </b>Start <i>SCRIPT</i>s. If no scripts are specified, start the
              scripts specified by the DEFAULT_START configuration. If
              DEFAULT_START is not set, start all scripts in the script
              directory. For scripts already started, the command is
              ignored.  The command will fail if the scripts fail to
              start (see also the PASSALL configuration).

              If the AUTOCOMPILE configuration is on, the command will
              try to compile or update the specified scripts when one of
              the below conditions is true:

              - The compiled cache file does not exist.

              - The mtime (modified timestamp) of the original script
                file is newer than the time of the compiled script
                cache.

              - The specified stap options used to compile the script
                has been changed (see also the SCRIPT PARAMETERS
                section).

              - The result of `uname -a` has been changed.

       <b>stop   </b>Stop <i>SCRIPT</i>s. If no scripts are specified, stop all
              running scripts. For scripts already stopped, the command
              is ignored. The command will fail if the scripts fail to
              stop (see also the PASSALL configuration).

       <b>restart</b>
              Stop and start <i>SCRIPT</i>s.

       <b>status </b>Show the state of <i>SCRIPT</i>s and their dependencies.

       <b>compile</b>
              Compile <i>SCRIPT</i>s but do not start them. If the scripts have
              already been compiled, prompt for confirmation before
              overwriting cache. Compile for the current kernel, or the
              kernel release specified by the <b>-r </b>option.

       <b>onboot </b>Make <i>SCRIPT</i>s part of the initramfs so that they are
              started earlier during the boot process. This command is
              only available on dracut-based systems. If no scripts are
              specified, create a normal initramfs devoid of any
              SystemTap files.

              The initramfs is created for the current kernel, or the
              kernel release specified by the <b>-r </b>option. The path of the
              created initramfs defaults to <b>/boot/initramfs-KVER.img</b>,
              where KVER is the output of `uname -r`. The bootloader is
              also updated (using <b>new-kernel-pkg</b>(8)) to make the kernel
              entry use the new initramfs file. Use the <b>-o </b>option to
              specify a different path (the bootloader will not be
              updated).

              If the output file already exists, it is overwritten,
              unless the <b>-b </b>switch is given, in which case the file is
              appended <b>.bak </b>rather than overwritten.  However, if there
              is already a <b>.bak </b>version of the file, the backup will not
              be overwritten.

              WARNING: do not use the <b>-o </b>option of <a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> with onboot
              scripts because the script is started before the root
              filesystem is even mounted.  Increase the buffer size if
              more space is needed.

       <b>cleanup</b>
              Delete the compiled <i>SCRIPT</i>s from cache. If no scripts are
              specified, then all compiled scripts are deleted. Only the
              cache for the current kernel is deleted, or the kernel
              release specified by the <b>-r </b>option. Prompt for
              confirmation before deleting.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Many of the commands can also take options. However, since users
       can't pass these options on boot, they are only meant for
       managing scripts after boot and for testing. Available options
       are:

       <b>-c </b><i>CONFIG_FILE</i>
              Specify a different configuration file in place of the
              default one.

       <b>-R     </b>When using the <b>start </b>and <b>stop </b>commands, also include the
              scripts' dependencies (recursively).

       <b>-r </b><i>KERNEL_RELEASE</i>
              When using the <b>compile</b>, <b>onboot</b>, and <b>cleanup </b>commands,
              specify the target kernel version rather than using the
              current one. Must be in the same format as `uname -r`.

       <b>-y     </b>Answer yes for all prompts.

       <b>-o </b><i>PATH.IMG</i>
              When using the <b>onboot </b>command, specify the output path of
              the created initramfs. When specified, the bootloader
              configuration is not updated.

       <b>-b     </b>When using the <b>onboot </b>command, backup an existing
              initramfs image by adding a <b>.bak </b>extension rather than
              overwriting it. Without this option, the initramfs is
              overwritten.
</pre> <h2>
GLOBAL PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
       These parameters affect the general behaviour of the SystemTap
       initscript service. They can be specified in the configuration
       file.

       <b>SCRIPT_PATH</b>
              Specify the absolute path of the script directory. These
              are the scripts on which the initscript can operate.
              Scripts must have the <b>.stp </b>extension.  The default path is
              <b>${prefix}/etc/systemtap/script.d</b>.

       <b>CONFIG_PATH</b>
              Specify the absolute path of the script configuration
              directory. These configuration files contain options for
              specific scripts. They must have the <b>.conf </b>extension. The
              default path is <b>${prefix}/etc/systemtap/conf.d</b>.

       <b>CACHE_PATH</b>
              Specify the absolute path of the cache directory. The
              default path is <b>${prefix}/var/cache/systemtap</b>.

       <b>TEMP_PATH</b>
              Specify the absolute path of the temporary directory in
              which SystemTap makes temporary directories to compile
              scripts. The default path is <b>/tmp</b>.

       <b>STAT_PATH</b>
              Specify the absolute path of the directory containing PID
              files used to track the status of SystemTap scripts. The
              default path is <b>${prefix}/var/run/systemtap</b>.

       <b>LOG_FILE</b>
              Specify the absolute path of the log file. All messages
              are sent to this file, including compilation and runtime
              errors. The default path is
              <b>${prefix}/var/log/systemtap.log</b>.

       <b>PASSALL</b>
              If this is set <b>yes</b>, initscript commands that operate on
              multiple scripts will report as failed when the action
              could not be performed on at least one script. If set to
              <b>no</b>, only a warning is emitted. The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>RECURSIVE</b>
              If this is set <b>yes</b>, the initscript will always follow
              script dependencies recursively. This means that there is
              no need to specify the <b>-R </b>option.  This flag is effective
              only if you specify script(s) from the command-line. The
              default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>AUTOCOMPILE</b>
              If this is set <b>yes</b>, the initscript automatically tries to
              compile specified scripts when needed if there is no valid
              cache. Otherwise, the related command simply fails. The
              default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>DEFAULT_START</b>
              Specify scripts which will be started by default. If
              omitted (or empty), all scripts in the script directory
              will be started. The default is <b>""</b>.

       <b>ALLOW_CACHEONLY</b>
              If this is set <b>yes</b>, the initscript will also allow
              operating on scripts that are located in the cache
              directory, but not in the script directory. The default is
              <b>no</b>.

              WARNING: the initscript may load unexpected obsolete
              caches with this option.  The cache directory should be
              checked before enabling this option.

       <b>LOG_BOOT_ERR</b>
              Because boot-time scripts are run before the root
              filesystem is mounted, staprun's stderr cannot be logged
              to the LOG_FILE as usual. However, the log can instead be
              output to /run/systemtap/$script.log by setting
              LOG_BOOT_ERR to <b>yes</b>. If STAT_PATH is different from the
              default, the log files will be moved there upon executing
              any of the initscript commands. The default is <b>no</b>.

       Here is a global configuration file example:

              SCRIPT_PATH=/var/systemtap/script.d/
              PASSALL=yes
              RECURSIVE=no
</pre> <h2>
SCRIPT PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
       These parameters affect the compilation or runtime behaviour of
       specific SystemTap scripts. They must be placed in config files
       located in the CONFIG_PATH directory.

       <b>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;_OPT</b>
              Specify options passed to the <a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> command for the
              SCRIPT. Here, SCRIPT is the name of the script file with‐
              out the <b>.stp </b>extension. Note that the <b>-F </b>option is always
              added.

              The following options are ignored when compiling scripts:
              -p, -m, -r, -c, -x, -e, -s, -o, -h, -V, -k.

              The following options are ignored when running starting
              scripts: -h, -V, -v, -t, -p, -I, -e, -R, -r, -m, -k, -g,
              -P, -D, -b, -u, -q, -w, -l, -d, -L, -F, and all long op‐
              tions.

       <b>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;_REQ</b>
              Specify script dependencies (i.e. which script this script
              requires). For example, if foo.stp requires (or needs to
              run after) bar.stp, set

              foo_REQ="bar"

              Specify multiple scripts by separating their names by
              spaces.

       Here is a script configuration file example:

              script1_OPT="-o /var/log/script1.out"
              script2_OPT="-o /var/log/script2.out"
              script2_REQ="script1"
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>INSTALLING SCRIPTS</b>
              We first copy a SystemTap script (e.g. "script1.stp") into
              the script directory:

              <b># </b>cp script1.stp /etc/systemtap/script.d/

              We can then set any script options, for example:

              <b># </b>vi /etc/systemtap/conf.d/group1.conf
              script1_OPT="-o /var/log/group1.out"

              We then install a script (e.g. "script2.stp") which needs
              to run after script1. In this case, we can do the follow‐
              ing:

              <b># </b>cp script2.stp /etc/systemtap/script.d/
              <b># </b>vi /etc/systemtap/conf.d/group1.conf
              script2_OPT="-o /var/log/group2.out"
              script2_REQ="script1"

              This way, if <a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> fails to run script1, the initscript
              will not even try to run script2.

       <b>TESTING</b>
              After installing scripts, we can test that they work by
              simply doing:

              <b># </b>systemtap-service start
              <b># </b>systemtap-service stop

              We could be more specific as well, for example:

              <b># </b>systemtap-service start script1
              <b># </b>systemtap-service stop script1

              If there were no errors, we are ready to use it.

       <b>ENABLING SERVICE</b>
              After we're satisfied with the scripts and their tests, we
              can enable the SystemTap initscript service:

              <b># </b>chkconfig systemtap on

       <b>DELETING SCRIPTS</b>
              Scripts are deleted by simply removing them from the
              script directory and removing any configuration lines spe‐
              cific to them:

              <b># </b>rm /etc/systemtap/script.d/script2.stp
              <b># </b>vi /etc/systemtap/conf.d/group1.conf

              If the script is still running, we also need to stop it:

              <b># </b>systemtap-service stop script2

              We can then also remove the cache associated with the
              script:

              <b># </b>systemtap-service cleanup script2

       <b>PREPARING FOR KERNEL UPDATES</b>
              Usually, there is nothing to do when booting into a new
              kernel. The initscript will see that the kernel version is
              different and will compile the scripts. The compilation
              can be done beforehand as well to avoid having to compile
              during boot by using the <b>-r </b>option:

              <b># </b>systemtap-service compile myscript -r &lt;NEW_KERNEL_VERSION&gt;

       <b>IMPORTING COMPILED SCRIPTS</b>
              For environments which lack compilation infrastructure
              (e.g. no compilers or debuginfo), such as a production
              system, the scripts can be compiled on another (develop‐
              ment) machine and then transferred over to the production
              system:

              <b># </b>systemtap-service compile myscript -r \
              &gt;   &lt;KERNEL_VERSION_OF_TARGET_MACHINE&gt;
              <b># </b>tar czf stap-scripts-&lt;kernel-version&gt;.tar.gz \
              &gt;   /var/cache/systemtap/&lt;kernel-version&gt; \
              &gt;   /etc/systemtap/conf.d/&lt;configfile&gt;

              And then copy this package to the target machine and ex‐
              tract it.

       <b>STARTING SCRIPTS DURING EARLY-BOOT</b>
              The initscript also allows us to start scripts earlier
              during the boot process by creating an initramfs contain‐
              ing the script's module. The system must be dracut-based
              for this to work. Starting a script at this stage gives
              access to information otherwise very hard to obtain.

              We first install the script by copying it into the script
              directory as usual and setting whatever options we'd like:

              <b># </b>cp myscript.stp /etc/systemtap/script.d
              <b># </b>vi /etc/systemtap/conf.d/myscript.conf

              To add the script to the initramfs, we use the <b>onboot </b>com‐
              mand:

              <b># </b>systemtap-service onboot myscript

              If the script is not already compiled and cached, it will
              be done at this point.  A new initramfs will then be cre‐
              ated at the default location. We can use the <b>-b </b>option to
              ensure that the existing initramfs is backed up. We can
              then restart the system.

       <b>USING A DIFFERENT INITRAMFS</b>
              If we would prefer to only start the script for one boot
              and not others, it might be easier to instead use the <b>-o</b>
              option to specify a different initramfs output file:

              <b># </b>systemtap-service onboot myscript \
              &gt;   -o /boot/special_initramfs.img

              Once the initramfs is created, it's simply a matter of
              changing the command-line options at boot-time so that the
              new image is used rather than the usual one.

       <b>CREATING AN INITRAMFS FOR A DIFFERENT KERNEL</b>
              Just like the compile command, we can use the <b>-r </b>option to
              specify the kernel for which we want to create the
              initramfs. This is useful when we are about to upgrade and
              would like to prepare in advance. For example:

              <b># </b>systemtap-service onboot myscript \
              &gt;   -r 3.12.6-200.fc19.x86_64

       <b>REMOVING SCRIPTS FROM THE INITRAMFS</b>
              Finally, to remove all script from the initramfs, we sim‐
              ple run the <b>onboot </b>command without specifying any scripts:

              <b># </b>systemtap-service onboot

              This will simply create a standard initramfs without any
              SystemTap modules inserted.

       <b>TROUBLESHOOTING EARLY-BOOT ISSUES</b>
              There can be many reasons for which the module didn't in‐
              sert or did not work as expected. It may be useful to turn
              on dracut debugging by adding 'rdinitdebug' to the kernel
              command-line and checking dmesg/journalctl -ae. Also, the
              stderr output of staprun can be captured by setting the
              LOG_BOOT_ERR option to <b>yes</b>.
