NAME </h2>
<pre>
       nfsdcltrack - NFSv4 Client Tracking Callout Program
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       nfsdcltrack [-d] [-f] [-s stable storage dir] &lt;command&gt; &lt;args...&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       nfsdcltrack is the NFSv4 client tracking callout program. It is
       not necessary to install this program on machines that are not
       acting as NFSv4 servers.

       When a network partition is combined with a server reboot, there
       are edge conditions that can cause the server to grant lock
       reclaims when other clients have taken conflicting locks in the
       interim. A more detailed explanation of this issue is described
       in RFC 3530, section 8.6.3 and in RFC 5661, section 8.4.3.

       In order to prevent these problems, the server must track a small
       amount of per-client information on stable storage. This program
       provides the userspace piece of that functionality. When the
       kernel needs to manipulate the database that stores this info, it
       will execute this program to handle it.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
           Enable debug level logging.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--foreground</b>
           Log to stderr instead of syslog.

       <b>-s </b><i>storagedir</i>, <b>--storagedir</b>=<i>storage_dir</i>
           Directory where stable storage information should be kept.
           The default value is <i>/var/lib/nfs/nfsdcltrack</i>.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       nfsdcltrack requires a command for each invocation. Supported
       commands are:

       <b>init</b>
           Initialize the database. This command requires no argument.

       <b>create</b>
           Create a new client record (or update the timestamp on an
           existing one). This command requires a hex-encoded
           nfs_client_id4 as an argument.

       <b>remove</b>
           Remove a client record from the database. This command
           requires a hex-encoded nfs_client_id4 as an argument.

       <b>check</b>
           Check to see if a nfs_client_id4 is allowed to reclaim. This
           command requires a hex-encoded nfs_client_id4 as an argument.

       <b>gracedone</b>
           Remove any unreclaimed client records from the database. This
           command requires a epoch boot time as an argument.
</pre> <h2>
EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The directory for stable storage information can be set via the
       file <b>/etc/nfs.conf </b>by setting the <b>storagedir </b>value in the
       <b>nfsdcltrack </b>section.  For example:
            [nfsdcltrack]
              storagedir = /shared/nfs/nfsdcltrack
       Debugging to syslog can also be enabled by setting "debug = 1" in
       this file.
</pre> <h2>
LEGACY TRANSITION MECHANISM </h2>
<pre>
       The Linux kernel NFSv4 server has historically tracked this
       information on stable storage by manipulating information on the
       filesystem directly, in the directory to which
       <i>/proc/fs/nfsd/nfsv4recoverydir</i> points. If the kernel passes the
       correct information, then nfsdcltrack can use it to allow a
       seamless transition from the old client tracking scheme to the
       new one.

       On a <b>check </b>operation, if there is no record of the client in the
       database, nfsdcltrack will look to see if the
       <b>NFSDCLTRACK_LEGACY_RECDIR </b>environment variable is set. If it is,
       then it will fetch that value and see if a directory exists by
       that name. If it does, then the check operation will succeed and
       the directory will be removed.

       On a <b>gracedone </b>operation, nfsdcltrack will look to see if the
       <b>NFSDCLTRACK_LEGACY_TOPDIR </b>environment variable is set. If it is,
       then it will attempt to clean out that directory prior to
       exiting.

       Note that this transition is one-way. If the machine subsequently
       reboots back into an older kernel that does not support the
       nfsdcltrack upcall then the clients will not be able to recover
       their state.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       This program requires a kernel that supports the nfsdcltrack
       usermodehelper upcall. This support was first added to mainline
       kernels in 3.8.
