DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>address </b>is a protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) address attached to a
       network device. Each device must have at least one address to use
       the corresponding protocol. It is possible to have several
       different addresses attached to one device. These addresses are
       not discriminated, so that the term <b>alias </b>is not quite
       appropriate for them and we do not use it in this document.

       The <b>ip address </b>command displays addresses and their properties,
       adds new addresses and deletes old ones.

   <b>ip address add - add new protocol address.</b>
       <b>dev </b><i>IFNAME</i>
              the name of the device to add the address to.

       <b>local </b><i>ADDRESS</i> <b>(default)</b>
              the address of the interface. The format of the address
              depends on the protocol. It is a dotted quad for IP and a
              sequence of hexadecimal halfwords separated by colons for
              IPv6. The <i>ADDRESS</i> may be followed by a slash and a decimal
              number which encodes the network prefix length.

       <b>peer </b><i>ADDRESS</i>
              the address of the remote endpoint for pointopoint
              interfaces.  Again, the <i>ADDRESS</i> may be followed by a slash
              and a decimal number, encoding the network prefix length.
              If a peer address is specified, the local address cannot
              have a prefix length. The network prefix is associated
              with the peer rather than with the local address.

       <b>broadcast </b><i>ADDRESS</i>
              the broadcast address on the interface.

              It is possible to use the special symbols <b>'+' </b>and <b>'-'</b>
              instead of the broadcast address. In this case, the
              broadcast address is derived by setting/resetting the host
              bits of the interface prefix.

       <b>label </b><i>LABEL</i>
              Each address may be tagged with a label string.  The
              maximum allowed total length of label is 15 characters.

       <b>scope </b><i>SCOPE_VALUE</i>
              the scope of the area where this address is valid.  The
              available scopes are listed in
              <b>/usr/lib/iproute2/rt_scopes</b>or
              <b>/etc/iproute2/rt_scopes</b>(has<b>precedence</b>if<b>exists).</b>
              Predefined scope values are:

                      <b>global </b>- the address is globally valid.

                      <b>site </b>- (IPv6 only, deprecated) the address is site
                      local, i.e. it is valid inside this site.

                      <b>link </b>- the address is link local, i.e. it is valid
                      only on this device.

                      <b>host </b>- the address is valid only inside this host.

       <b>metric </b><i>NUMBER</i>
              priority of prefix route associated with address.

       <b>valid_lft </b><i>LFT</i>
              the valid lifetime of this address; see section 5.5.4 of
              RFC 4862. When it expires, the address is removed by the
              kernel.  Defaults to <b>forever</b>.

       <b>preferred_lft </b><i>LFT</i>
              the preferred lifetime of this address; see section 5.5.4
              of RFC 4862. When it expires, the address is no longer
              used for new outgoing connections. Defaults to <b>forever</b>.

       <b>home   </b>(IPv6 only) designates this address the "home address" as
              defined in RFC 6275.

       <b>mngtmpaddr</b>
              (IPv6 only) make the kernel manage temporary addresses
              created from this one as template on behalf of Privacy
              Extensions (RFC3041). For this to become active, the
              <b>use_tempaddr </b>sysctl setting has to be set to a value
              greater than zero.  The given address needs to have a
              prefix length of 64. This flag allows to use privacy
              extensions in a manually configured network, just like if
              stateless auto-configuration was active.

       <b>nodad  </b>(IPv6 only) do not perform Duplicate Address Detection
              (RFC 4862) when adding this address.

       <b>optimistic</b>
              (IPv6 only) When performing Duplicate Address Detection,
              use the RFC 4429 optimistic variant.

       <b>noprefixroute</b>
              Do not automatically create a route for the network prefix
              of the added address, and don't search for one to delete
              when removing the address. Changing an address to add this
              flag will remove the automatically added prefix route,
              changing it to remove this flag will create the prefix
              route automatically.

       <b>autojoin</b>
              Joining multicast groups on Ethernet level via <b>ip maddr</b>
              command does not work if connected to an Ethernet switch
              that does IGMP snooping since the switch would not
              replicate multicast packets on ports that did not have
              IGMP reports for the multicast addresses.

              Linux VXLAN interfaces created via <b>ip link add vxlan </b>have
              the <b>group </b>option that enables them to do the required
              join.

              Using the <b>autojoin </b>flag when adding a multicast address
              enables similar functionality for Openvswitch VXLAN
              interfaces as well as other tunneling mechanisms that need
              to receive multicast traffic.

       <b>proto </b><i>ADDRPROTO</i>
              the protocol identifier of this route.  <i>ADDRPROTO</i> may be a
              number or a string from the file
              <b>/etc/iproute2/rt_addrprotos</b>.  If the protocol ID is not
              given,

              <b>ip assumes protocol 0. Several protocol </b>values have a
              fixed interpretation. Namely:

                      <b>kernel_lo </b>- The ::1 address that kernel installs
                      on a loopback netdevice has this
                        protocol value

                      <b>kernel_ra </b>- IPv6 addresses installed in response
                      to router advertisement messages

                      <b>kernel_ll </b>- Link-local addresses have this
                      protocol value

              The rest of the values are not reserved and the
              administrator is free to assign (or not to assign)
              protocol tags.

   <b>ip address delete - delete protocol address</b>
       <b>Arguments: </b>coincide with the arguments of <b>ip addr add.  </b>The
       device name is a required argument. The rest are optional.  If no
       arguments are given, the first address is deleted.

   <b>ip address show - look at protocol addresses</b>
       <b>dev </b><i>IFNAME</i> <b>(default)</b>
              name of device.

       <b>scope </b><i>SCOPE_VAL</i>
              only list addresses with this scope.

       <b>to </b><i>PREFIX</i>
              only list addresses matching this prefix.

       <b>label </b><i>PATTERN</i>
              only list addresses with labels matching the <i>PATTERN</i>.
              <i>PATTERN</i> is a usual shell style pattern.

       <b>master </b><i>DEVICE</i>
              only list interfaces enslaved to this master device.

       <b>vrf </b><i>NAME</i>
              only list interfaces enslaved to this vrf.

       <b>type </b><i>TYPE</i>
              only list interfaces of the given type.

              Note that the type name is not checked against the list of
              supported types - instead it is sent as-is to the kernel.
              Later it is used to filter the returned interface list by
              comparing it with the relevant attribute in case the
              kernel didn't filter already. Therefore any string is
              accepted, but may lead to empty output.

       <b>up     </b>only list running interfaces.

       <b>nomaster</b>
              only list interfaces with no master.

       <b>dynamic </b>and <b>permanent</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses installed due to stateless
              address configuration or only list permanent (not dynamic)
              addresses. These two flags are inverses of each other, so
              <b>-dynamic </b>is equal to <b>permanent </b>and <b>-permanent </b>is equal to
              <b>dynamic</b>.

       <b>tentative</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have not yet passed
              duplicate address detection.

       <b>-tentative</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses which are not in the
              process of duplicate address detection currently.

       <b>deprecated</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list deprecated addresses.

       <b>-deprecated</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses not being deprecated.

       <b>dadfailed</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have failed
              duplicate address detection.

       <b>-dadfailed</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have not failed
              duplicate address detection.

       <b>temporary </b>or <b>secondary</b>
              List temporary IPv6 or secondary IPv4 addresses only. The
              Linux kernel shares a single bit for those, so they are
              actually aliases for each other although the meaning
              differs depending on address family.

       <b>-temporary </b>or <b>-secondary</b>
              These flags are aliases for <b>primary</b>.

       <b>primary</b>
              List only primary addresses, in IPv6 exclude temporary
              ones. This flag is the inverse of <b>temporary </b>and <b>secondary</b>.

       <b>-primary</b>
              This is an alias for <b>temporary </b>or <b>secondary</b>.

       <b>proto </b><i>ADDRPROTO</i>
              Only show addresses with a given protocol, or those for
              which the kernel response did not include protocol. See
              the corresponding argument to <b>ip addr add </b>for details
              about address protocols.

   <b>ip address flush - flush protocol addresses</b>
       This command flushes the protocol addresses selected by some
       criteria.

       This command has the same arguments as <b>show </b>except that <b>type </b>and
       <b>master </b>selectors are not supported.  Another difference is that
       it does not run when no arguments are given.

       <b>Warning: </b>This command and other <b>flush </b>commands are unforgiving.
       They will cruelly purge all the addresses.

       With the <b>-statistics </b>option, the command becomes verbose. It
       prints out the number of deleted addresses and the number of
       rounds made to flush the address list.  If this option is given
       twice, <b>ip address flush </b>also dumps all the deleted addresses in
       the format described in the previous subsection.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       ip address show
           Shows IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to all network
           interfaces. The 'show' subcommand can be omitted.

       ip address show up
           Same as above except that only addresses assigned to active
           network interfaces are shown.

       ip address show dev eth0
           Shows IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to network interface
           eth0.

       ip address add 2001:0db8:85a3::0370:7334/64 dev eth1
           Adds an IPv6 address to network interface eth1.

       ip address delete 2001:0db8:85a3::0370:7334/64 dev eth1
           Delete the IPv6 address added above.

       ip address flush dev eth4 scope global
           Removes all global IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from device eth4.
           Without 'scope global' it would remove all addresses
           including IPv6 link-local ones.
