       <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>— sudo event and I/O log server
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>[<b>-hnV</b>] [<b>-f </b><i>file</i>] [<b>-R </b><i>percentage</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>is a high-performance log server that accepts event
       and I/O logs from <b>sudo</b>.  It can be used to implement centralized
       logging of <b>sudo </b>logs.  The server has two modes of operation:
       local and relay.  By default, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>stores the logs
       locally but it can also be configured to relay them to another
       server that supports the <i>sudo_logsrv.proto</i>(5) protocol.

       When not relaying, event log entries may be logged either via
       <i>syslog</i>(3) or to a local file.  I/O Logs stored locally by
       <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>can be replayed via the <i>sudoreplay</i>(8) utility in the
       same way as logs generated directly by the <b>sudoers </b>plugin.

       The server also supports restarting interrupted log transfers.
       To distinguish completed I/O logs from incomplete ones, the I/O
       log timing file is set to be read-only when the log is complete.

       Configuration parameters for <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>may be specified in the
       <i>sudo_logsrvd.conf</i>(5) file or the file specified via the <b>-f</b>
       option.

       <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>rereads its configuration file when it receives
       SIGHUP and writes server state to the debug file (if one is
       configured) when it receives SIGUSR1.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-f </b><i>file</i>, <b>--file</b>=<i>file</i>
               Read configuration from <i>file</i> instead of the default,
               <i>/etc/sudo_logsrvd.conf</i>.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               Display a short help message to the standard output and
               exit.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-fork</b>
               Run <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>in the foreground instead of detaching
               from the terminal and becoming a daemon.

       <b>-R </b><i>percentage</i>, <b>--random-drop</b>=<i>percentage</i>
               For each message, there is a <i>percentage</i> chance that the
               server will drop the connection.  This is only intended
               for debugging the ability of a client to restart a
               connection.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Print the <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>version and exit.

   <b>Securing server connections</b>
       The I/O log data sent to <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>may contain sensitive
       information such as passwords and should be secured using
       Transport Layer Security (TLS).  Doing so requires having a
       signed certificate on the server and, if <i>tls_checkpeer</i> is enabled
       in <i>sudo_logsrvd.conf</i>(5), a signed certificate on the client as
       well.

       The certificates can either be signed by a well-known Certificate
       Authority (CA), or a private CA can be used.  Instructions for
       creating a private CA are included below in the “EXAMPLES”
       section.

   <b>Debugging sudo_logsrvd</b>
       <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>supports a flexible debugging framework that is
       configured via <i>Debug</i> lines in the <i>sudo.conf</i>(5) file.

       For more information on configuring <i>sudo.conf</i>(5), refer to its
       manual.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Creating self-signed certificates</b>
       Unless you are using certificates signed by a well-known
       Certificate Authority (or a local enterprise CA), you will need
       to create your own CA that can sign the certificates used by
       <b>sudo_logsrvd</b>, <b>sudo_sendlog</b>, and the <b>sudoers </b>plugin.  The
       following steps use the <i>openssl</i>(1) command to create keys and
       certificates.

   <b>Initial setup</b>
       First, we need to create a directory structure to store the files
       for the CA.  We'll create a new directory hierarchy in
       <i>/etc/ssl/sudo</i> for this purpose.

           # mkdir /etc/ssl/sudo
           # cd /etc/ssl/sudo
           # mkdir certs csr newcerts private
           # chmod 700 private
           # touch index.txt
           # echo 1000 &gt; serial

       The serial and index.txt files are used to keep track of signed
       certificates.

       Next, we need to make a copy of the openssl.conf file and
       customize it for our new CA.  The path to openssl.cnf is system-
       dependent but <i>/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf</i> is the most common location.
       You will need to adjust the example below if it has a different
       location on your system.

           # cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf .

       Now edit the <i>openssl.cnf</i> file in the current directory and make
       sure it contains “ca”, “CA_default”, “v3_ca”, and “usr_cert”
       sections.  Those sections should include at least the following
       settings:

           [ ca ]
           default_ca              = CA_default

           [ CA_default ]
           dir                     = /etc/ssl/sudo
           certs                   = $dir/certs
           database                = $dir/index.txt
           certificate             = $dir/cacert.pem
           serial                  = $dir/serial

           [ v3_ca ]
           subjectKeyIdentifier    = hash
           authorityKeyIdentifier  = keyid:always,issuer
           basicConstraints        = critical,CA:true
           keyUsage                = cRLSign, keyCertSign

           [ usr_cert ]
           basicConstraints        = CA:FALSE
           keyUsage                = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, \
                                     keyEncipherment
           subjectKeyIdentifier    = hash
           authorityKeyIdentifier  = keyid,issuer

       If your <i>openssl.conf</i> file already has a “CA_default” section, you
       may only need to modify the “dir” setting and enable the
       “keyUsage” settings if they are commented out.

   <b>Creating the CA key and certificate</b>
       In order to create and sign our own certificates, we need to
       create a private key and a certificate for the root of the CA.
       First, create the private key and protect it with a pass phrase:

           # openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private/cakey.pem 4096
           # chmod 400 private/cakey.pem

       Next, generate the root certificate, using appropriate values for
       the site-specific fields:

           # openssl req -config openssl.cnf -key private/cakey.pem \
               -new -x509 -days 7300 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca \
               -out cacert.pem

           Enter pass phrase for private/cakey.pem:
           You are about to be asked to enter information that will be
           incorporated into your certificate request.
           What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name
           or a DN.
           There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank.
           For some fields there will be a default value,
           If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
           -----
           Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
           State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Colorado
           Locality Name (eg, city) []:
           Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgets Pty Ltd]:sudo
           Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:sudo Certificate Authority
           Common Name (e.g., server FQDN or YOUR name) []:sudo Root CA
           Email Address []:

           # chmod 444 cacert.pem

       Finally, verify the root certificate:

           # openssl x509 -noout -text -in cacert.pem

   <b>Creating and signing certificates</b>
       The server and client certificates will be signed by the
       previously created root CA.  Usually, the root CA is not used to
       sign server/client certificates directly.  Instead, intermediate
       certificates are created and signed with the root CA and the
       intermediate certs are used to sign CSRs (Certificate Signing
       Request).  In this example we'll skip this part for simplicity's
       sake and sign the CSRs with the root CA.

       First, generate the private key without a pass phrase.

           # openssl genrsa -out private/logsrvd_key.pem 2048
           # chmod 400 private/logsrvd_key.pem

       Next, create a certificate signing request (CSR) for the server's
       certificate.  The organization name must match the name given in
       the root certificate.  The common name should be either the
       server's IP address or a fully qualified domain name.

           # openssl req -config openssl.cnf -key private/logsrvd_key.pem -new \
               -sha256 -out csr/logsrvd_csr.pem

           Enter pass phrase for private/logsrvd_key.pem:
           You are about to be asked to enter information that will be
           incorporated into your certificate request.
           What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name
           or a DN.
           There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank.
           For some fields there will be a default value,
           If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
           -----
           Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
           State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Colorado
           Locality Name (eg, city) []:
           Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgets Pty Ltd]:sudo
           Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:sudo log server
           Common Name (e.g., server FQDN or YOUR name) []:logserver.example.com
           Email Address []:

           Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
           to be sent with your certificate request
           A challenge password []:
           An optional company name []:

       Now sign the CSR that was just created:

           # openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -days 375 -notext -md sha256 \
               -in csr/logsrvd_csr.pem -out certs/logsrvd_cert.pem

           Using configuration from openssl.cnf
           Enter pass phrase for ./private/cakey.pem:
           Check that the request matches the signature
           Signature ok

           1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]y
           Write out database with 1 new entries
           Data Base Updated

       Finally, verify the new certificate:

           # openssl verify -CAfile cacert.pem certs/logsrvd_cert.pem
           certs/logsrvd_cert.pem: OK

       The <i>/etc/ssl/sudo/certs</i> directory now contains a signed and
       verified certificate for use with <b>sudo_logsrvd</b>.

       To generate a client certificate, repeat the process above using
       a different file name.

   <b>Configuring sudo_logsrvd to use TLS</b>
       To use TLS for client/server communication, both <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>and
       the <b>sudoers </b>plugin need to be configured to use TLS.  Configuring
       <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>for TLS requires the following settings, assuming
       the same path names used earlier:

           # Listen on port 30344 for TLS connections to any address.
           listen_address = *:30344(tls)

           # Path to the certificate authority bundle file in PEM format.
           tls_cacert = /etc/ssl/sudo/cacert.pem

           # Path to the server's certificate file in PEM format.
           tls_cert = /etc/ssl/sudo/certs/logsrvd_cert.pem

           # Path to the server's private key file in PEM format.
           tls_key = /etc/ssl/sudo/private/logsrvd_key.pem

       The root CA cert (<i>cacert.pem</i>) must be installed on the system
       running <b>sudo_logsrvd</b>.  If peer authentication is enabled on the
       client, a copy of <i>cacert.pem</i> must be present on the client system
       too.
