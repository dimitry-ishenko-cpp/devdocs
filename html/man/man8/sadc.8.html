NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sadc - System activity data collector.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/usr/local/lib64/sa/sadc [ -C </b><i>comment</i> <b>] [ -D ] [ -F ] [ -f ] [ -L</b>
       <b>] [ -V ] [ -S { </b><i>keyword</i><b>[,...] | ALL | XALL } ] [ </b><i>interval</i> <b>[ </b><i>count</i>
       <b>] ] [ </b><i>outfile</i> <b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sadc </b>command samples system data a specified number of times
       (<i>count</i>) at a specified interval measured in seconds (<i>interval</i>).
       It writes in binary format to the specified <i>outfile</i> or to
       standard output. If <i>outfile</i> is set to <b>-</b>, then <b>sadc </b>uses the
       standard system activity daily data file (see below).  In this
       case, if the file already exists, <b>sadc </b>will overwrite it if it is
       from a previous month. By default <b>sadc </b>collects most of the data
       available from the kernel.  But there are also optional metrics,
       for which the relevant options must be explicitly passed to <b>sadc</b>
       to be collected (see option <b>-S </b>below).

       The standard system activity daily data file is named <i>saDD</i> unless
       option <b>-D </b>is used, in which case its name is <i>saYYYYMMDD</i>, where
       <i>YYYY</i> stands for the current year, <i>MM</i> for the current month and <i>DD</i>
       for the current day. By default it is located in the <i>/var/log/sa</i>
       directory. Yet it is possible to specify an alternate location
       for it: If <i>outfile</i> is a directory (instead of a plain file) then
       it will be considered as the directory where the standard system
       activity daily data file will be saved.

       When the <i>count</i> parameter is not specified, <b>sadc </b>writes its data
       endlessly. When both <i>interval</i> and <i>count</i> are not specified, and
       option <b>-C </b>is not used, a dummy record, which is used at system
       startup to mark the time when the counter restarts from 0, will
       be written.  For example, one of the system startup script may
       write the restart mark to the daily data file by the command
       entry:

       <b>/usr/local/lib64/sa/sadc -</b>

       The <b>sadc </b>command is intended to be used as a backend to the <b>sar</b>
       command.

       Note: The <b>sadc </b>command only reports on local activities.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-C </b><i>comment</i>
              When neither the <i>interval</i> nor the <i>count</i> parameters are
              specified, this option tells <b>sadc </b>to write a dummy record
              containing the specified <i>comment</i> string. This comment can
              then be displayed with option <b>-C </b>of <b>sar</b>.

       <b>-D     </b>Use <i>saYYYYMMDD</i> instead of <i>saDD</i> as the standard system
              activity daily data file name.

       <b>-F     </b>The creation of <i>outfile</i> will be forced. If the file
              already exists and has a format unknown to <b>sadc </b>then it
              will be truncated. This may be useful for daily data files
              created by an older version of <b>sadc </b>and whose format is no
              longer compatible with current one.

       <b>-f     </b>fdatasync() will be used to ensure data is written to
              disk. This differs from the normal operation in that a
              sudden system reset is less likely to result in the <i>saDD</i>
              datafiles being corrupted. However, this is at the expense
              of performance within the <b>sadc </b>process as forward progress
              will be blocked while data is written to underlying disk
              instead of just to cache.

       <b>-L     sadc </b>will try to get an exclusive lock on the <i>outfile</i>
              before writing to it or truncating it. Failure to get the
              lock is fatal, except in the case of trying to write a
              normal (i.e. not a dummy and not a header) record to an
              existing file, in which case <b>sadc </b>will try again at the
              next interval. Usually, the only reason a lock would fail
              would be if another <b>sadc </b>process were also writing to the
              file. This can happen when <b>cron </b>is used to launch <b>sadc</b>. If
              the system is under heavy load, an old <b>sadc </b>might still be
              running when <b>cron </b>starts a new one. Without locking, this
              situation can result in a corrupted system activity file.

       <b>-S { </b><i>keyword</i><b>[,...] | ALL | XALL }</b>
              Possible keywords are <b>DISK</b>, <b>INT</b>, <b>IPV6</b>, <b>POWER</b>, <b>SNMP</b>, <b>XDISK</b>,
              <b>ALL </b>and <b>XALL</b>.
              Specify which optional activities should be collected by
              <b>sadc</b>.  Some activities are optional to prevent data files
              from growing too large. The <b>DISK </b>keyword indicates that
              <b>sadc </b>should collect data for block devices. The <b>INT</b>
              keyword indicates that <b>sadc </b>should collect data for system
              interrupts. The <b>IPV6 </b>keyword indicates that IPv6
              statistics should be collected by <b>sadc</b>. The <b>POWER </b>keyword
              indicates that <b>sadc </b>should collect power management
              statistics. The <b>SNMP </b>keyword indicates that SNMP
              statistics should be collected by <b>sadc</b>. The <b>ALL </b>keyword is
              equivalent to specifying all the keywords above and
              therefore all previous activities are collected.

              The <b>XDISK </b>keyword is an extension to the <b>DISK </b>one and
              indicates that partitions and filesystems statistics
              should be collected by <b>sadc </b>in addition to disk
              statistics. This option works only with kernels 2.6.25 and
              later. The <b>XALL </b>keyword is equivalent to specifying all
              the keywords above (including keyword extensions) and
              therefore all possible activities are collected.

              Important note: The activities (including optional ones)
              saved in an existing data file prevail over those selected
              with option <b>-S</b>.  As a consequence, appending data to an
              existing data file will result in option <b>-S </b>being ignored.

       <b>-V     </b>Print version number then exit.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sadc </b>command takes into account the following environment
       variable:

       <b>S_TIME_DEF_TIME</b>
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>UTC </b>then <b>sadc</b>
              will save its data in UTC time.  <b>sadc </b>will also use UTC
              time instead of local time to determine the current daily
              data file located in the <i>/var/log/sa</i> directory.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/usr/local/lib64/sa/sadc 1 10 /tmp/datafile</b>
              Write 10 records of one second intervals to the
              <i>/tmp/datafile</i> binary file.

       <b>/usr/local/lib64/sa/sadc -C "Backup Start" /tmp/datafile</b>
              Insert the comment "Backup Start" into the file
              <i>/tmp/datafile</i>.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>/proc</i> filesystem must be mounted for the <b>sadc </b>command to
       work.

       All the statistics are not necessarily available, depending on
       the kernel version used.  <b>sadc </b>assumes that you are using at
       least a 2.6 kernel.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/var/log/sa/saDD</i>
       <i>/var/log/sa/saYYYYMMDD</i>
              The standard system activity daily data files and their
              default location.  <i>YYYY</i> stands for the current year, <i>MM</i>
              for the current month and <i>DD</i> for the current day.
       <i>/proc</i> and <i>/sys</i> contain various files with system statistics.
