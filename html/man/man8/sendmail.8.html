NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sendmail </b>— a mail enqueuer for <i>smtpd</i>(8)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sendmail </b>[<b>-tv</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>name</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>from</i>] <i>to ...</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sendmail </b>utility is a local enqueuer for the <i>smtpd</i>(8) daemon,
       compatible with <i>mailwrapper</i>(8).  The message is read on standard
       input (stdin) until <b>sendmail </b>encounters an end-of-file.  The
       <b>sendmail </b>enqueuer is not intended to be used directly to send
       mail, but rather via a frontend known as a mail user agent.

       Unless the optional <b>-t </b>flag is specified, one or more recipients
       must be specified on the command line.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-F </b><i>name</i>
               Set the sender's full name.

       <b>-f </b><i>from</i>
               Set the sender's address.

       <b>-t      </b>Read the message's To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields for
               recipients.  The Bcc: field will be deleted before
               sending.

       <b>-v      </b>Enable verbose output.

       To maintain compatibility with Sendmail, Inc.'s implementation of
       <b>sendmail</b>, various other flags are accepted, but have no effect.
