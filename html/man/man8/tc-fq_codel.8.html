DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       FQ_Codel (Fair Queuing Controlled Delay) is queuing discipline
       that combines Fair Queuing with the CoDel AQM scheme. FQ_Codel
       uses a stochastic model to classify incoming packets into
       different flows and is used to provide a fair share of the
       bandwidth to all the flows using the queue. Each such flow is
       managed by the CoDel queuing discipline. Reordering within a flow
       is avoided since Codel internally uses a FIFO queue.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>limit</b>
       has the same semantics as <b>codel </b>and is the hard limit on the real
       queue size.  When this limit is reached, incoming packets are
       dropped. Default is 10240 packets.

   <b>memory_limit</b>
       sets a limit on the total number of bytes that can be queued in
       this FQ-CoDel instance. The lower of the packet limit of the
       <b>limit </b>parameter and the memory limit will be enforced. Default is
       32 MB.

   <b>flows</b>
       is the number of flows into which the incoming packets are
       classified. Due to the stochastic nature of hashing, multiple
       flows may end up being hashed into the same slot. Newer flows
       have priority over older ones. This parameter can be set only at
       load time since memory has to be allocated for the hash table.
       Default value is 1024.

   <b>target</b>
       has the same semantics as <b>codel </b>and is the acceptable minimum
       standing/persistent queue delay. This minimum delay is identified
       by tracking the local minimum queue delay that packets
       experience. Default value is 5ms.

   <b>interval</b>
       has the same semantics as <b>codel </b>and is used to ensure that the
       measured minimum delay does not become too stale.  The minimum
       delay must be experienced in the last epoch of length <b>interval</b>.
       It should be set on the order of the worst-case RTT through the
       bottleneck to give endpoints sufficient time to react. Default
       value is 100ms.

   <b>quantum</b>
       is the number of bytes used as 'deficit' in the fair queuing
       algorithm. Default is set to 1514 bytes which corresponds to the
       Ethernet MTU plus the hardware header length of 14 bytes.

   <b>ecn | noecn</b>
       has the same semantics as <b>codel </b>and can be used to mark packets
       instead of dropping them. If <b>ecn </b>has been enabled, <b>noecn </b>can be
       used to turn it off and vice-a-versa. Unlike <b>codel, ecn </b>is turned
       on by default.

   <b>ce_threshold</b>
       sets a threshold above which all packets are marked with ECN
       Congestion Experienced. This is useful for DCTCP-style congestion
       control algorithms that require marking at very shallow queueing
       thresholds.

   <b>ce_threshold_selector</b>
       sets a filter so that the <b>ce_threshold </b>feature is applied to only
       a subset of the traffic seen by the qdisc. If set, the MASK value
       will be applied as a bitwise AND to the diffserv/ECN byte of the
       IP header, and only if the result of this masking equals VALUE,
       will the <b>ce_threshold </b>logic be applied to the packet.

   <b>drop_batch</b>
       sets the maximum number of packets to drop when <b>limit </b>or
       <b>memory_limit </b>is exceeded. Default value is 64.
