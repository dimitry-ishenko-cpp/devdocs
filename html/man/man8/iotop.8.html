NAME </h2>
<pre>
       iotop - simple top-like I/O monitor
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>iotop </b>[<i>OPTIONS</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       iotop watches I/O usage information output by the Linux kernel
       (requires 2.6.20 or later) and displays a table of current I/O
       usage by processes or threads on the system. At least the
       CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT, CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING,
       CONFIG_TASKSTATS and CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS options need to be
       enabled in your Linux kernel build configuration and since Linux
       kernel 5.14, the kernel.task_delayacct sysctl enabled.

       iotop displays columns for the I/O bandwidth read and written by
       each process/thread during the sampling period. It also displays
       the percentage of time the thread/process spent while swapping in
       and while waiting on I/O. For each process, its I/O priority
       (class/level) is shown.

       In addition, the total I/O bandwidth read and written during the
       sampling period is displayed at the top of the interface.  <b>Total</b>
       <b>DISK READ </b>and <b>Total DISK WRITE </b>values represent total read and
       write bandwidth between processes and kernel threads on the one
       side and kernel block device subsystem on the other. While
       <b>Current DISK READ </b>and <b>Current DISK WRITE </b>values represent
       corresponding bandwidths for current disk I/O between kernel
       block device subsystem and underlying hardware (HDD, SSD, etc.).
       Thus <b>Total </b>and <b>Current </b>values may not be equal at any given
       moment of time due to data caching and I/O operations reordering
       that take place inside Linux kernel.

       Use the left and right arrows to change the sorting, r to reverse
       the sorting order, o to toggle the --only option, p to toggle the
       --processes option, a to toggle the --accumulated option, q to
       quit or i to change the priority of a thread or a process's
       thread(s). Any other key will force a refresh.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--version</b>
              Show the version number and exit

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show usage information and exit

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--only</b>
              Only show processes or threads actually doing I/O, instead
              of showing all processes or threads. This can be
              dynamically toggled by pressing o.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--batch</b>
              Turn on non-interactive mode.  Useful for logging I/O
              usage over time.

       <b>-n </b>NUM, <b>--iter</b>=<i>NUM</i>
              Set the number of iterations before quitting (never quit
              by default).  This is most useful in non-interactive mode.

       <b>-d </b>SEC, <b>--delay</b>=<i>SEC</i>
              Set the delay between iterations in seconds (1 second by
              default).  Accepts non-integer values such as 1.1 seconds.

       <b>-p </b>PID, <b>--pid</b>=<i>PID</i>
              A list of processes/threads to monitor (all by default).

       <b>-u </b>USER, <b>--user</b>=<i>USER</i>
              A list of users to monitor (all by default)

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--processes</b>
              Only show processes. Normally iotop shows all threads.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--accumulated</b>
              Show accumulated I/O instead of bandwidth. In this mode,
              iotop shows the amount of I/O processes have done since
              iotop started.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--kilobytes</b>
              Use kilobytes instead of a human friendly unit. This mode
              is useful when scripting the batch mode of iotop. Instead
              of choosing the most appropriate unit iotop will display
              all sizes in kilobytes.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--time</b>
              Add a timestamp on each line (implies --batch). Each line
              will be prefixed by the current time.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              suppress some lines of header (implies --batch). This
              option can be specified up to three times to remove header
              lines.

       <b>--no-help</b>
              Suppress the keyboard shortcuts help display.
              <b>-q     </b>column names are only printed on the first
                     iteration,
              <b>-qq    </b>column names are never printed,
              <b>-qqq   </b>the I/O summary is never printed.
