       <b>crash </b>[<i>OPTION</i>]... <i>[NAMELIST]</i>                         <i>(live system</i>
       <i>form)</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Crash </b>is a tool for interactively analyzing the state of the
       Linux system while it is running, or after a kernel crash has
       occurred and a core dump has been created by the <i>netdump,</i>
       <i>diskdump, LKCD, kdump, xendump kvmdump</i> or <i>VMware</i> facilities.  It
       is loosely based on the SVR4 UNIX crash command, but has been
       significantly enhanced by completely merging it with the <a href="../man1/gdb.1.html">gdb(1)</a>
       debugger. The marriage of the two effectively combines the
       kernel-specific nature of the traditional UNIX crash utility with
       the source code level debugging capabilities of <b>gdb(1).</b>

       In the <i>dumpfile form,</i> both a NAMELIST and a MEMORY-IMAGE argument
       must be entered.  In the <i>live system form,</i> the NAMELIST argument
       must be entered if the kernel's <i>vmlinux</i> file is not located in a
       known location, such as the <i>/usr/lib/debug/lib/modules/&lt;kernel-</i>
       <i>version&gt;</i> directory.

       The <b>crash </b>utility has also been extended to support the analysis
       of dumpfiles generated by a crash of the Xen hypervisor.  In that
       case, the NAMELIST argument must be that of the <i>xen-syms</i> binary.
       Live system analysis is not supported for the Xen hypervisor.

       The <b>crash </b>utility command set consists of common kernel core
       analysis tools such as kernel stack back traces of all processes,
       source code disassembly, formatted kernel structure and variable
       displays, virtual memory data, dumps of linked-lists, etc., along
       with several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
       subsystems.  Appropriate <b>gdb </b>commands may also be entered, which
       in turn are passed on to the <b>gdb </b>module for execution.  If
       desired, commands may be placed in either a <i>$HOME/.crashrc</i> file
       and/or in a <i>.crashrc</i> file in the current directory.  During
       initialization, the commands in <i>$HOME/.crashrc</i> are executed
       first, followed by those in the <i>./.crashrc</i> file.

       The <b>crash </b>utility is designed to be independent of Linux version
       dependencies. When new kernel source code impacts the correct
       functionality of <b>crash </b>and its command set, the utility will be
       updated to recognize new kernel code changes, while maintaining
       backwards compatibility with earlier releases.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>NAMELIST</b>
              This is a pathname to an uncompressed kernel image (a
              <i>vmlinux</i> file), or a Xen hypervisor image (a <i>xen-syms</i> file)
              which has been compiled with the "-g" option.  If using
              the <i>dumpfile form,</i> a <i>vmlinux</i> file may be compressed in
              either gzip or bzip2 formats.

       <b>MEMORY-IMAGE[@ADDRESS]</b>
              A kernel core dump file created by the <i>netdump, diskdump,</i>
              <i>LKCD kdump, xendump kvmdump</i> or <i>VMware</i> facilities.

              If a MEMORY-IMAGE argument is not entered, the session
              will be invoked on the live system, which typically
              requires root privileges because of the device file used
              to access system RAM.  By default, <i>/dev/crash</i> will be used
              if it exists.  If it does not exist, then <i>/dev/mem</i> will be
              used; but if the kernel has been configured with
              <b>CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, </b>then <i>/proc/kcore</i> will be used.  It
              is permissible to explicitly enter <i>/dev/crash, /dev/mem</i> or
              <i>/proc/kcore.</i>

              An @ADDRESS value must be appended to the MEMORY-IMAGE if
              the dumpfile is a raw RAM dumpfile that has no header
              information describing the file contents.  Multiple
              MEMORY-IMAGE@ADDRESS ordered pairs may be entered, with
              each dumpfile containing a contiguous block of RAM, where
              the ADDRESS value is the physical start address of the
              block expressed in hexadecimal.  The physical address
              value(s) will be used to create a temporary ELF header in
              /var/tmp, which will only exist during the crash session.
              If a raw RAM dumpile represents a live memory source, such
              as that specified by the QEMU mem-path argument of a
              memory-backend-file object, then "live:" must be prepended
              to the MEMORY-IMAGE name.

              As VMware facility, the <b>crash </b>utility is able to process
              VMware VM memory dump generated by VM suspend or guest
              core dump. In that case, .vmss or .guest file should be
              used as a MEMORY-IMAGE and .vmem file must be located in
              the same folder.

       <b>mapfile</b>
              If the NAMELIST file is not the same kernel that is
              running (live system form), or the kernel that was running
              when the system crashed (dumpfile form), then the
              <i>System.map</i> file of the original kernel should be entered
              on the command line.

       <b>-h </b><i>[option]</i>
       <b>--help </b><i>[option]</i>
              Without an <i>option</i> argument, display a <b>crash </b>usage help
              message.  If the <i>option</i> argument is a <b>crash </b>command name,
              the help page for that command is displayed.  If it is the
              string "input", a page describing the various <b>crash</b>
              command line input options is displayed.  If it is the
              string "output", a page describing command line output
              options is displayed.  If it is the string "all", then all
              of the possible help messages are displayed.  After the
              help message is displayed, <b>crash </b>exits.

       <b>-s     </b>Silently proceed directly to the "crash&gt;" prompt without
              displaying any version, GPL, or <b>crash </b>initialization data
              during startup, and by default, runtime command output is
              not passed to any scrolling command.

       <b>-i </b><i>file</i>
              Execute the command(s) contained in <i>file</i> prior to
              displaying the "crash&gt;" prompt for interactive user input.

       <b>-d </b><i>num</i> Set the internal debug level.  The higher the number, the
              more debugging data will be printed when <b>crash </b>initializes
              and runs.

       <b>-S     </b>Use <i>/boot/System.map</i> as the <i>mapfile</i>.

       <b>-e </b><i>vi | emacs</i>
              Set the <b>readline(3) </b>command line editing mode to "vi" or
              "emacs".  The default editing mode is "vi".

       <b>-f     </b>Force the usage of a compressed <i>vmlinux</i> file if its
              original name does not start with "vmlinux".

       <b>-k     </b>Indicate that the NAMELIST file is an LKCD "Kerntypes"
              debuginfo file.

       <b>-g </b><i>[namelist]</i>
              Determine if a <i>vmlinux</i> or <i>xen-syms</i> namelist file contains
              debugging data.

       <b>-t     </b>Display the system-crash timestamp and exit.

       <b>-L     </b>Attempt to lock all of its virtual address space into
              memory by calling mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE) during
              initialization.  If the system call fails, an error
              message will be displayed, but the session continues.

       <b>-c </b><i>tty-device</i>
              Open the <i>tty-device</i> as the console used for debug
              messages.

       <b>-p </b><i>page-size</i>
              If a processor's page size cannot be determined by the
              dumpfile, and the processor default cannot be used, use
              <i>page-size.</i>

       <b>-o </b><i>filename</i>
              Only used with the MEMORY-IMAGE@ADDRESS format for raw RAM
              dumpfiles, specifies a filename of a new ELF vmcore that
              will be created and used as the dumpfile.  It will be
              saved to allow future use as a standalone vmcore,
              replacing the original raw RAM dumpfile.

       <b>-m </b><i>option=value</i>
       <b>--machdep </b><i>option=value</i>
              Pass an option and value pair to machine-dependent code.
              These architecture-specific option/pairs should only be
              required in very rare circumstances:

              directory will be used.  Otherwise
              <i>/usr/lib64/crash/extensions</i> (64-bit architectures) or
              <i>/usr/lib/crash/extensions</i> (32-bit architectures) will be
              used; if they do not exist, then the <i>./extensions</i>
              <i>directory will be used.</i>

       <b>--active</b>
              Track only the active task on each cpu.

       <b>--buildinfo</b>
              Display the crash binary's build date, the user ID of the

       <b>--memory_device </b><i>device</i>
              Use <i>device</i> as an alternative device to the <i>/dev/crash,</i>
              <i>/dev/mem</i> or <i>/proc/kcore</i> devices.

       <b>--log </b><i>dumpfile</i>
              Dump the contents of the kernel log buffer.  A kernel
              namelist argument is not necessary, but the dumpfile must
              contain the VMCOREINFO data taken from the original
              /proc/vmcore ELF header.

       <b>--no_kallsyms</b>
              Do not use kallsyms-generated symbol information contained
              within kernel module object files.

       <b>--no_modules</b>
              Do not access or display any kernel module related
              information.

       <b>--no_data_debug</b>
              Do not verify the validity of all structure member offsets
              and structure sizes that it uses.

       <b>--no_kmem_cache</b>
              Do not initialize the kernel's slab cache infrastructure,
              and commands that use kmem_cache-related data will not
              work.

       <b>--no_elf_notes</b>
              Do not use the registers from the ELF NT_PRSTATUS notes
              saved in a compressed kdump header for backtraces.

       <b>--kmem_cache_delay</b>
              Delay the initialization of the kernel's slab cache
              infrastructure until it is required by a run-time command.

       <b>--readnow</b>
              Pass this flag to the embedded <b>gdb </b>module, which will
              override its two-stage strategy that it uses for reading
              symbol tables from the NAMELIST.

       <b>--smp  </b>Specify that the system being analyzed is an SMP kernel.

              notices.

       <b>--cpus </b><i>number</i>
              Specify the <i>number</i> of cpus in the SMP system being
              analyzed.

       <b>--osrelease </b><i>dumpfile</i>
              Display the OSRELEASE vmcoreinfo string from a kdump
              <i>dumpfile</i> header.

       <b>--hyper</b>
              Force the session to be that of a Xen hypervisor.

       <b>--p2m_mfn </b><i>pfn</i>
              When a Xen Hypervisor or its dom0 kernel crashes, the
              dumpfile is typically analyzed with either the Xen
              hypervisor or the dom0 kernel.  It is also possible to
              analyze any of the guest domU kernels if the
              pfn_to_mfn_list_list <i>pfn</i> value of the guest kernel is
              passed on the command line along with its NAMELIST and the
              dumpfile.

       <b>--xen_phys_start </b><i>physical-address</i>
              Supply the base physical address of the Xen hypervisor's
              text and static data for older xendump dumpfiles that did
              not pass that information in the dumpfile header.

       <b>--zero_excluded</b>
              If the makedumpfile(8) facility has filtered a compressed
              kdump dumpfile to exclude various types of non-essential
              pages, or has marked a compressed or ELF kdump dumpfile as
              incomplete due to an ENOSPC or other error during its
              creation, any attempt to read missing pages will fail.
              With this flag, reads from any of those pages will return
              zero-filled memory.

       <b>--no_panic</b>
              Do not attempt to find the task that was running when the
              kernel crashed.  Set the initial context to that of the
              "swapper" task on cpu 0.

       <b>--more </b>Use <i>/bin/more</i> as the command output scroller, overriding
              the default of <i>/usr/bin/less</i> and any settings in either
              <i>./.crashrc</i> or <i>$HOME/.crashrc.</i>

       <b>--less </b>Use <i>/usr/bin/less</i> as the command output scroller,
              overriding any settings in either <i>./.crashrc</i> or
              <i>$HOME/.crashrc.</i>

       <b>--hex  </b>Set the default command output radix to 16, overriding the
              default radix of 10, and any radix settings in either
              <i>./.crashrc</i> or <i>$HOME/.crashrc.</i>

       <b>--dec  </b>Set the default command output radix to 10, overriding any
              radix settings in either <i>./.crashrc</i> or <i>$HOME/.crashrc.</i>
              <i>This is the default radix setting.</i>

       <b>--CRASHPAGER</b>
              Use the output paging command defined in the <b>CRASHPAGER</b>
              shell environment variable, overriding any settings in
              either <i>./.crashrc</i> or <i>$HOME/.crashrc.</i>

       <b>--no_scroll</b>
              Do not pass run-time command output to any scrolling
              command.

       <b>--no_strip</b>
              Do not strip cloned kernel text symbol names.

       <b>--no_crashrc</b>
              Do not execute the commands in either <i>$HOME/.crashrc</i> or
              <i>./.crashrc.</i>

       <b>--mod </b><i>directory</i>
              When loading the debuginfo data of kernel modules with the
              <i>mod -S</i> command, search for their object files in <i>directory</i>
              instead of in the standard location.

       <b>--src </b><i>directory</i>
              Search for the kernel source code in directory instead of
              in the standard location that is compiled into the
              debuginfo data.

       <b>--kaslr </b><i>offset</i><b>|</b><i>auto</i>
              If an x86, x86_64, s390x or loongarch64 kernel was
              configured with <b>CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE, </b>the offset value is
              equal to the difference between the symbol values compiled
              into the vmlinux file and their relocated KASLR values.
              If set to auto, the KASLR offset value will be
              automatically calculated.

       <b>--reloc </b><i>size</i>
              When analyzing live x86 kernels that were configured with
              a <b>CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START </b>value that is larger than its
              <b>CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN </b>value, then it will be necessary to
              enter a relocation size equal to the difference between
              the two values.

       <b>--hash </b><i>count</i>
              Set the number of internal hash queue heads used for list
              gathering and verification.  The default count is 32768.

       <b>--minimal</b>
              Bring up a session that is restricted to the <i>log, dis, rd,</i>
              <i>sym, eval, set</i> and <i>exit</i> commands.  This option may provide
              a way to extract some minimal/quick information from a
              corrupted or truncated dumpfile, or in situations where
              one of the several kernel subsystem initialization
              routines would abort the <b>crash </b>session.

       <b>--kvmhost </b><i>[32|64]</i>
              When examining an x86 KVM guest dumpfile, this option
              specifies that the KVM host that created the dumpfile was

</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       Each <b>crash </b>command generally falls into one of the following
       categories:

       <i>Symbolic display</i>
              Displays of kernel text/data, which take full advantage of
              the power of <b>gdb </b>to format and display data structures
              symbolically.

       <i>System state</i>
              The majority of <b>crash </b>commands consist of a set of
              "kernel-aware" commands, which delve into various kernel
              subsystems on a system-wide or per-task basis.

       <i>Utility functions</i>
              A set of useful helper commands serving various purposes,
              some simple, others quite powerful.

       <i>Session control</i>
              Commands that control the <b>crash </b>session itself.

       The following alphabetical list consists of a very simple
       overview of each <b>crash </b>command.  However, since individual
       commands often have several options resulting in significantly
       different output, it is suggested that the full description of
       each command be viewed by executing <i>crash -h &lt;command&gt;,</i> or during
       a <b>crash </b>session by simply entering <i>help command</i><b>.</b>

       <i>*</i>      "pointer to" is shorthand for either the <i>struct</i> or <i>union</i>
              commands.  It displays the contents of a kernel structure
              or union.

       <i>alias</i>  creates a single-word alias for a command.

       <i>ascii</i>  displays an ascii chart or translates a numeric value into
              its ascii components.

       <i>bpf</i>    provides information on currently-loaded eBPF programs and
              maps.

       <i>bt</i>     displays a task's kernel-stack backtrace.  If it is given
              the <i>-a</i> option, it displays the stack traces of the active
              tasks on all CPUs.  It is often used with the <i>foreach</i>
              command to display the backtraces of all tasks with one
              command.

       <i>btop</i>   translates a byte value (physical offset) to its page
              number.

       <i>dev</i>    displays data concerning the character and block device
              assignments, I/O port usage, I/O memory usage, and PCI
              device data.

       <i>dis</i>    disassembles memory, either entire kernel functions, from
              a location for a specified number of instructions, or from
              the start of a function up to a specified memory location.

       <i>eval</i>   evaluates an expression or numeric type and displays the
              result in hexadecimal, decimal, octal and binary.

       <i>exit</i>   causes <b>crash </b>to exit.

       <i>extend</i> dynamically loads or unloads <b>crash </b>shared object extension
              modules.

       <i>files</i>  displays information about open files in a context.

       <i>foreach</i>
              repeats a specified command for the specified (or all)
              tasks in the system.

       <i>fuser</i>  displays the tasks using the specified file or socket.

       <i>gdb</i>    passes its argument to the embedded <b>gdb </b>module.  It is
              useful for executing <b>gdb </b>commands that have the same name
              as <b>crash </b>commands.

       <i>help</i>   alone displays the command menu; if followed by a command
              name, a full description of a command, its options, and
              examples are displayed.  Its output is far more complete
              and useful than this man page.

       <i>ipcs</i>   displays data about the System V IPC facilities.

       <i>irq</i>    displays data concerning interrupt request numbers and
              bottom-half interrupt handling.

       <i>kmem</i>   displays information about the use of kernel memory.

       <i>list</i>   displays the contents of a linked list.

       <i>log</i>    displays the kernel log_buf contents in chronological
              order.

       <i>mach</i>   displays data specific to the machine type.

       <i>mod</i>    displays information about the currently installed kernel
              modules, or adds or deletes symbolic or debugging
              information about specified kernel modules.

       <i>mount</i>  displays information about the currently-mounted
              filesystems.

       <i>net</i>    display various network related data.

       <i>p</i>      passes its arguments to the <b>gdb </b>"print" command for
              evaluation and display.

       <i>ps</i>     displays process status for specified, or all, processes
              in the system.

       <i>pte</i>    translates the hexadecimal contents of a PTE into its
              physical page address and page bit settings.

       <i>ptob</i>   translates a page frame number to its byte value.

       <i>ptov</i>   translates a hexadecimal physical address into a kernel
              virtual address.

       <i>q</i>      is an alias for the "exit" command.

       <i>rd</i>     displays the contents of memory, with the output formatted
              in several different manners.

       <i>repeat</i> repeats a command indefinitely, optionally delaying a
              given number of seconds between each command execution.

       <i>runq</i>   displays the tasks on the run queue.

       <i>sbitmapq</i>
              dumps the contents of the sbitmap_queue structure and the
              used bits in the bitmap. Also, it shows the dump of a
              structure array associated with the sbitmap_queue.

       <i>search</i> searches a range of user or kernel memory space for given
              value.

       <i>set</i>    either sets a new context, or gets the current context for
              display.

       <i>sig</i>    displays signal-handling data of one or more tasks.

       <i>struct</i> displays either a structure definition or the contents of
              a kernel structure at a specified address.

       <i>swap</i>   displays information about each configured swap device.

       <i>sym</i>    translates a symbol to its virtual address, or a static
              kernel virtual address to its symbol -- or to a symbol-
              plus-offset value, if appropriate.

       <i>sys</i>    displays system-specific data.

       <i>task</i>   displays the contents of a task_struct.

       <i>tree</i>   displays the contents of a red-black tree or a radix tree.

       <i>timer</i>  displays the timer queue entries, both old- and new-style,
              in chronological order.

       <i>union</i>  is similar to the <i>struct</i> command, except that it works on
              kernel unions.

       <i>vm</i>     displays basic virtual memory information of a context.

       <i>vtop</i>   translates a user or kernel virtual address to its
              physical address.

       <i>waitq</i>  walks the wait queue list displaying the tasks which are
              blocked on the specified wait queue.

       <i>whatis</i> displays the definition of structures, unions, typedefs or
              text/data symbols.

       <i>wr</i>     modifies the contents of memory on a live system.  It can
              only be used if <i>/dev/mem</i> is the device file being used to
              access system RAM, and should obviously be used with great
              care.

       When <b>crash </b>is invoked with a Xen hypervisor binary as the
       NAMELIST, the command set is slightly modified.  The <i>*, alias,</i>
       <i>ascii, bt, dis, eval, exit, extend, gdb, help, list, log, p, pte,</i>
       <i>rd, repeat, search, set, struct, sym, sys, union, whatis, wr</i> and
       <i>q</i> commands are the same as above.  The following commands are
       specific to the Xen hypervisor:

       <i>domain</i> displays the contents of the domain structure for
              selected, or all, domains.

       <i>doms</i>   displays domain status for selected, or all, domains.

       <i>dumpinfo</i>
              displays Xen dump information for selected, or all, cpus.

       <i>pcpus</i>  displays physical cpu information for selected, or all,
              cpus.

       <i>vcpus</i>  displays vcpu status for selected, or all, vcpus.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>.crashrc</i>
              Initialization commands.  The file can be located in the
              user's <b>HOME </b>directory and/or the current directory.
              Commands found in the <i>.crashrc</i> file in the <b>HOME </b>directory
              are executed before those in the current directory's
              <i>.crashrc</i> file.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EDITOR </b>Command input is read using <a href="../man3/readline.3.html">readline(3)</a>.  If <b>EDITOR </b>is set
              to <i>emacs</i> or <i>vi</i> then suitable keybindings are used.  If
              <b>EDITOR </b>is not set, then <i>vi</i> is used.  This can be
              overridden by <b>set vi </b>or <b>set emacs </b>commands located in a
              <i>.crashrc</i> file, or by entering <b>-e emacs </b>on the <b>crash</b>
              command line.

       <b>CRASHPAGER</b>
              If <b>CRASHPAGER </b>is set, its value is used as the name of the
              program to which command output will be sent.  If not,
              then command output is sent to <b>/usr/bin/less -E -X </b>by
              default.

       <b>CRASH_MODULE_PATH</b>
              Specifies an alternative directory tree to search for
              kernel module object files.

       <b>CRASH_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Specifies a directory containing extension modules that
              will be loaded automatically if the <b>-x </b>command line option
              is used.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       If <b>crash </b>does not work, look for a newer version: kernel
       evolution frequently makes <b>crash </b>updates necessary.

       The command <b>set scroll off </b>will cause output to be sent directly
       to the terminal rather than through a paging program.  This is
       useful, for example, if you are running <b>crash </b>in a window of
       <b>emacs</b>.
