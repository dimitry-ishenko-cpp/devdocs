INTRODUCTION </h2>
<pre>
       NFS version 4 introduces the concept of <i>file system referrals</i> to
       NFS.

       A file system referral is like a symbolic link (or, <i>symlink</i>) to
       another file system share, typically on another file server.  An
       NFS client, under the server's direction, mounts the referred-to
       NFS export automatically when an application first accesses it.

       NFSv4 referrals can be used to transparently redirect clients to
       file systems that have been moved elsewhere, or to construct a
       single file name space across multiple file servers.  Because
       file servers control the shape of the whole file name space, no
       client configuration is required.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A <i>junction</i> is a file system object on an NFS server that, when an
       NFS client encounters it, triggers a referral.  Similar to a
       symlink, a junction contains one or more target locations that
       the server sends to clients in the form of an NFSv4 referral.

       On Linux, an existing directory can be converted to a junction
       and back atomically and without the loss of the directory
       contents.  When a directory acts as a junction, it's local
       content is hidden from NFSv4 clients.

       The <a href="nfsref.8.html">nfsref(8)</a> command is a simple way to get started managing
       junctions and their content.

   <b>Subcommands</b>
       Valid <a href="nfsref.8.html">nfsref(8)</a> subcommands are:

       <b>add    </b>Adds junction information to the directory named by
              <i>pathname</i>.  The named directory must already exist, and
              must not already contain junction information.  Regular
              directory contents are obscured to NFS clients by this
              operation.

              A list of one or more file server and export path pairs is
              also specified on the command line.  When creating an NFS
              basic junction, this list is stored in an extended
              attribute of the directory.

              If junction creation is successful, the <a href="nfsref.8.html">nfsref(8)</a> command
              flushes the kernel's export cache to remove previously
              cached junction information.

       <b>remove </b>Removes junction information from the directory named by
              <i>pathname</i>.  The named directory must exist, and must
              contain junction information.  Regular directory contents
              are made visible to NFS clients again by this operation.

              If junction deletion is successful, the <a href="nfsref.8.html">nfsref(8)</a> command
              flushes the kernel's export cache to remove previously
              cached junction information.

       <b>lookup </b>Displays junction information stored in the directory
              named by <i>pathname</i>.  The named directory must exist, and
              must contain junction information.

              When looking up an NFS basic junction, the junction
              information in the directory is listed on <i>stdout</i>.

   <b>Command line options</b>
       <b>-d, --debug</b>
              Enables debugging messages during operation.

       <b>-t, --type=</b><i>junction-type</i>
              Specifies the junction type for the operation.  Valid
              values for <i>junction-type</i> are <b>nfs-basic </b>or <b>nfs-fedfs</b>.

              For the <b>add </b>subcommand, the default value if this option
              is not specified is <b>nfs-basic</b>.  The <b>nfs-fedfs </b>type is not
              used in this implementation.

              For the <b>remove </b>and <b>lookup </b>subcommands, the <b>--type </b>option
              is not required.  The <a href="nfsref.8.html">nfsref(8)</a> command operates on
              whatever junction contents are available.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Suppose you have two file servers, <i>top.example.net</i> and
       <i>home.example.net</i>.  You want all your clients to mount
       <i>top.example.net:/</i> and then see the files under <i>home.example.net:/</i>
       automatically in <i>top:/home</i>.

       On <i>top.example.net</i>, you might issue this command as root:

              # mkdir /home
              # nfsref add /home home.example.net /
              Created junction /home.
