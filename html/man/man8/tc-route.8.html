</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       route - route traffic control filter
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tc filter </b>... <b>route </b>[ <b>from </b><i>REALM</i> | <b>fromif </b><i>TAG</i> ] [ <b>to </b><i>REALM</i> ] [
               <b>classid </b><i>CLASSID</i> ] [ <b>action </b><i>ACTION_SPEC</i> ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Match packets based on routing table entries. This filter centers
       around the possibility to assign a <b>realm </b>to routing table
       entries. For any packet to be classified by this filter, a
       routing table lookup is performed and the returned <b>realm </b>is used
       to decide on whether the packet is a match or not.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>action </b><i>ACTION_SPEC</i>
              Apply an action from the generic actions framework on
              matching packets.

       <b>classid </b><i>CLASSID</i>
              Push matching packets into the class identified by
              <i>CLASSID</i>.

       <b>from </b><i>REALM</i>
       <b>fromif </b><i>TAG</i>
              Perform source route lookups.  <i>TAG</i> is the name of an
              interface which must be present on the system at the time
              of <b>tc </b>invocation.

       <b>to </b><i>REALM</i>
              Match if normal (i.e., destination) routing returns the
              given <i>REALM</i>.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Consider the subnet 192.168.2.0/24 being attached to eth0:

              ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 dev eth0 realm 2

       The following <b>route </b>filter will then match packets from that
       subnet:

              tc filter add ... route from 2 classid 1:2

       and pass packets on to class 1:2.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Due to implementation details, <b>realm </b>values must be in a range
       from 0 to 255, inclusive. Alternatively, a verbose name defined
       in /etc/iproute2/rt_realms may be given instead.
