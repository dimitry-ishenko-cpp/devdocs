DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Run the <i>cmd</i> application within a tightly confined SELinux domain.
       The default sandbox domain only allows applications the ability
       to read and write stdin, stdout and any other file descriptors
       handed to it. It is not allowed to open any other files.  The -M
       option will mount an alternate homedir and tmpdir to be used by
       the sandbox.

       If you have the <i>policycoreutils-sandbox</i> package installed, you
       can use the -X option and the -M option.  <b>sandbox -X </b>allows you
       to run X applications within a sandbox.  These applications will
       start up their own X Server and create a temporary home directory
       and /tmp.  The default SELinux policy does not allow any
       capabilities or network access.  It also prevents all access to
       the users other processes and files.  Files specified on the
       command that are in the home directory or /tmp will be copied
       into the sandbox directories.

       If directories are specified with -H or -T the directory will
       have its context modified with chcon(1) unless a level is
       specified with -l.  If the MLS/MCS security level is specified,
       the user is responsible to set the correct labels.

       <b>-h --help</b>
              display usage message

       <b>-H --homedir</b>
              Use alternate homedir to mount over your home directory.
              Defaults to temporary. Requires -X or -M.

       <b>-i --include</b>
              Copy this file into the appropriate temporary sandbox
              directory. Command can be repeated.

       <b>-I --includefile</b>
              Copy all files listed in inputfile into the appropriate
              temporary sandbox directories.

       <b>-l --level</b>
              Specify the MLS/MCS Security Level to run the sandbox
              with.  Defaults to random.

       <b>-M --mount</b>
              Create a Sandbox with temporary files for $HOME and /tmp.

       <b>-s --shred</b>
              Shred temporary files created in $HOME and /tmp, before
              deleting.

       <b>-t --type</b>
              Use alternate sandbox type, defaults to sandbox_t or
              sandbox_x_t for -X.

              <b>Examples:</b>
              sandbox_t -    No X, No Network Access, No Open,
              read/write on passed in file descriptors.
              sandbox_min_t  -    No Network Access
              sandbox_x_t    -    Ports for X applications to run
              locally
              sandbox_web_t  -    Ports required for web browsing
              sandbox_net_t  -         Network ports (for server
              software)
              sandbox_net_client_t     -    All network ports

       <b>-T --tmpdir</b>
              Use alternate temporary directory to mount on /tmp.
              Defaults to tmpfs. Requires -X or -M.

       <b>-R --runuserdir</b>
              Use alternate temporary directory to mount on
              XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (/run/user/$UID).

       <b>-S --session</b>
              Run a full desktop session, Requires level, and home and
              tmpdir.

       <b>-w --windowsize</b>

              Specifies the windowsize when creating an X based Sandbox.
              The default windowsize is 1000x700.

       <b>-W --windowmanager</b>
              Select alternative window manager to run within <b>sandbox</b>
              <b>-X.  </b>Default to /usr/bin/openbox.

       <b>-X     </b>Create an X based Sandbox for gui apps, temporary files
              for $HOME and /tmp, secondary Xserver, defaults to
              sandbox_x_t

       <b>-d --dpi</b>
              Set the DPI value for the sandbox X Server. Defaults to
              the current X Sever DPI.

       <b>-C --capabilities </b>Use capabilities within the
              sandbox. By default applications executed within the
              sandbox will not be allowed to use capabilities (setuid
              apps), with the -C flag, you can use programs requiring
              capabilities.
