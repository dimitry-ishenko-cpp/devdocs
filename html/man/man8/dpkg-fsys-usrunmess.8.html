NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-fsys-usrunmess - undoes the merged-/usr-via-aliased-dirs
       mess
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-fsys-usrunmess </b>[<b>option</b>...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-fsys-usrunmess </b>is a tool to fix up filesystems that have
       been installed anew with recent installers with unfortunate
       defaults or migrated to the broken merged /usr via aliased
       directories layout, which is <b>not </b>supported by dpkg.  See the dpkg
       FAQ.

       <b>Note</b>: In Debian its tech-ctte has decreed that on the release
       after bookworm the non-usrmerged layout is not going to be
       supported, and thus some of its maintainers might not fix issues
       or intentionally remove non-usrmerged support, so you will need
       decide and pick your poison.

       The program will perform the following overall actions:

       •   Check whether the system needs to be switched, otherwise do
           nothing,

       •   Check for dpkg database consistency and otherwise abort.

       •   Generate and install a regression prevention package, if
           requested on the command-line or otherwise on the prompt.

       •   Get the list of files and alternatives that need to be
           restored.

       •   Look for untracked kernel modules files that need to be moved
           too.

       •   Create a shadow hierarchy under <i>/.usrunmess</i>, by creating the
           directories symlinks or hardlinking or copying the files as
           needed.

       •   Prompt for confirmation before proceeding, if requested on
           the command-line.

       •   Lock the dpkg database.

       •   Mark all packages as half-configured to force running
           maintainer scripts that might need to recreate files.

       •   Replace the aliased directories with the shadow ones, by
           creating a backup of the old symlinked directories and
           renaming the shadow ones over.

       •   Relabel MAC information for directories and symlinks if
           necessary.

       •   Remove backup symlinks.

       •   Remove old moved objects, but defer directory removal.

       •   Remove old deferred directories that are not referenced by
           dpkg-query.

       •   Remove shadow root directory.

       •   Register a <b>policy-rc.d </b>to disallow service actions, which
           means that services might need to be restarted afterwards,
           ideally via a reboot.

       •   Reconfigure all packages.

       •   Unregister the <b>policy-rc.d </b>and restore the alternatives
           state.

       <b>Note</b>: When running the program from some shells such as <a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash(1)</a>
       or <b>zsh</b>(1), after executing it, you might need to request the
       shell to forget all remembered executable locations with for
       example "hash -r".

       <b>Note</b>: Some directories might linger after the migration in case
       they contain untracked files.  A list is printed once the script
       has finished for further investigation.

       <b>Warning</b>: Note that this operation has the potential to render the
       system unusable or broken in case of a sudden crash or reboot,
       unexpected state of the system, or possible bugs in the script.
       Be prepared with recovery media and consider doing backups
       beforehand.

       This program was introduced in dpkg 1.20.6.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-p</b>, <b>--prompt</b>
           Prompt at the time of no return, so that the debug output or
           the shadow hierarchy can be evaluated before proceeding.

       <b>--prevention</b>
       <b>--no-prevention</b>
           Enables or disables generating and installing a regression
           prevention package into the system.  If no option has been
           specified, the action to take will be prompted.

           The generated package contains the <b>Protected </b>field set to <b>yes</b>
           to protect against accidental removal of the package.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-act</b>
       <b>--dry-run</b>
           This option enables the dry-run mode, where no destructive
           action takes place, only the preparatory part.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
