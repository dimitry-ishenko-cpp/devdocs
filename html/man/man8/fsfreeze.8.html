NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fsfreeze - suspend access to a filesystem (Ext3/4, ReiserFS, JFS,
       XFS)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>fsfreeze --freeze</b>|<b>--unfreeze </b><i>mountpoint</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>fsfreeze </b>suspends or resumes access to a filesystem.

       <b>fsfreeze </b>halts any new access to the filesystem and creates a
       stable image on disk. <b>fsfreeze </b>is intended to be used with
       hardware RAID devices that support the creation of snapshots.

       <b>fsfreeze </b>is unnecessary for <b>device-mapper </b>devices. The
       device-mapper (and LVM) automatically freezes a filesystem on the
       device when a snapshot creation is requested. For more details
       see the <a href="dmsetup.8.html">dmsetup(8)</a> man page.

       The <i>mountpoint</i> argument is the pathname of the directory where
       the filesystem is mounted. The filesystem must be mounted to be
       frozen (see <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>).

       Note that access-time updates are also suspended if the
       filesystem is mounted with the traditional atime behavior (mount
       option <b>strictatime</b>, for more details see <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-f</b>, <b>--freeze</b>
           This option requests the specified filesystem to be frozen
           from new modifications. When this is selected, all ongoing
           transactions in the filesystem are allowed to complete, new
           <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> system calls are halted, other calls which modify
           the filesystem are halted, and all dirty data, metadata, and
           log information are written to disk. Any process attempting
           to write to the frozen filesystem will block waiting for the
           filesystem to be unfrozen.

           Note that even after freezing, the on-disk filesystem can
           contain information on files that are still in the process of
           unlinking. These files will not be unlinked until the
           filesystem is unfrozen or a clean mount of the snapshot is
           complete.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unfreeze</b>
           This option is used to un-freeze the filesystem and allow
           operations to continue. Any filesystem modifications that
           were blocked by the freeze are unblocked and allowed to
           complete.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
FILESYSTEM SUPPORT </h2>
<pre>
       This command will work only if filesystem supports has support
       for freezing. List of these filesystems include (2016-12-18)
       <b>btrfs</b>, <b>ext2/3/4</b>, <b>f2fs</b>, <b>jfs</b>, <b>nilfs2</b>, <b>reiserfs</b>, and <b>xfs</b>. Previous
       list may be incomplete, as more filesystems get support. If in
       doubt easiest way to know if a filesystem has support is create a
       small loopback mount and test freezing it.
