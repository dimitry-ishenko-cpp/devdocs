NAME </h2>
<pre>
       xfs_copy - copy the contents of an XFS filesystem
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_copy </b>[ <b>-bd </b>] [ <b>-L </b><i>log</i> ] <i>source target1</i> [ <i>target2</i> ... ]
       <b>xfs_copy -V</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_copy </b>copies an XFS filesystem to one or more targets in
       parallel (see <a href="../man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a>).  The first (<i>source</i>) argument must be the
       pathname of the device or file containing the XFS filesystem. The
       remaining arguments specify one or more <i>target</i> devices or file
       names. If the pathnames specify devices, a copy of the source XFS
       filesystem is created on each device. The <i>target</i> can also be the
       name of a regular file, in which case an image of the source XFS
       filesystem is created in that file. If the file does not exist,
       <b>xfs_copy </b>creates the file. The length of the resulting file is
       equal to the size of the source filesystem. However, if the file
       is created on an XFS filesystem, the file consumes roughly the
       amount of space actually used in the source filesystem by the
       filesystem and the XFS log.  The space saving is because <b>xfs_copy</b>
       seeks over free blocks instead of copying them and the XFS
       filesystem supports sparse files efficiently.

       <b>xfs_copy </b>should only be used to copy unmounted filesystems, read-
       only mounted filesystems, or frozen filesystems (see
       <a href="xfs_freeze.8.html">xfs_freeze(8)</a>).  Otherwise, the generated filesystem(s) would be
       inconsistent or corrupt.

       <b>xfs_copy </b>does not alter the source filesystem in any way. Each
       new (target) filesystem is identical to the original filesystem
       except that new filesystems each have a new unique filesystem
       identifier (UUID).  Therefore, if both the old and new
       filesystems will be used as separate distinct filesystems,
       <b>xfs_copy </b>or <a href="xfsdump.8.html">xfsdump(8)</a>/<a href="xfsrestore.8.html">xfsrestore(8)</a> should be used to generate
       the new filesystem(s) instead of <a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd(1)</a> or other programs that do
       block-by-block disk copying.

       <b>xfs_copy </b>uses synchronous writes to ensure that write errors are
       detected.

       <b>xfs_copy </b>uses <a href="../man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads(7)</a> to perform simultaneous parallel
       writes.  <b>xfs_copy </b>creates one additional thread for each target
       to be written.  All threads die if <b>xfs_copy </b>terminates or aborts.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d     </b>Create a duplicate (true clone) filesystem. This should be
              done only if the new filesystem will be used as a
              replacement for the original filesystem (such as in the
              case of disk replacement).

       <b>-b     </b>The buffered option can be used to ensure direct IO is not
              attempted to any of the target files. This is useful when
              the filesystem holding the target file does not support
              direct IO.

       <b>-L </b><i>log</i> Specifies the location of the <i>log</i> if the default location
              of <i>/var/tmp/xfs_copy.log.XXXXXX</i> is not desired.

       <b>-V     </b>Prints the version number and exits.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_copy </b>reports errors to both <b>stderr </b>and in more detailed form
       to a generated log file whose name is of the form
       <i>/var/tmp/xfs_copy.log.XXXXXX</i> or a log file specified by the <b>-L</b>
       option. If <b>xfs_copy </b>detects a write error on a target, the copy
       of that one target is aborted and an error message is issued to
       both stderr and the log file, but the rest of the copies
       continue. When <b>xfs_copy </b>terminates, all aborted targets are
       reported to both <b>stderr </b>and the log file.

       If all targets abort or if there is an error reading the source
       filesystem, <b>xfs_copy </b>immediately aborts.

       <b>xfs_copy </b>returns an exit code of 0 if all targets are
       successfully copied and an exit code of 1 if any target fails.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       When moving filesystems from one disk to another, if the original
       filesystem is significantly smaller than the new filesystem, and
       will be made larger, we recommend that <b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) and
       <a href="xfsdump.8.html">xfsdump(8)</a>/<a href="xfsrestore.8.html">xfsrestore(8)</a> be used instead of using <b>xfs_copy </b>and
       <a href="xfs_growfs.8.html">xfs_growfs(8)</a>.  The filesystem layout resulting from using
       <b>xfs_copy</b>/<b>xfs_growfs </b>is almost always worse than the result of
       using <b>mkfs.xfs</b>/<b>xfsdump</b>/<b>xfsrestore </b>but in the case of small
       filesystems, the differences can have a significant performance
       impact. This is due to the way <a href="xfs_growfs.8.html">xfs_growfs(8)</a> works, and not due
       to any shortcoming in <b>xfs_copy </b>itself.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_copy </b>does not copy XFS filesystems that have a real-time
       section or XFS filesystems with external logs. In both cases,
       <b>xfs_copy </b>aborts with an error message.
