NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-udev-settle.service - Wait for all pending udev events to
       be handled
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-udev-settle.service
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This service calls <b>udevadm settle </b>to wait until all events that
       have been queued by <a href="../man7/udev.7.html">udev(7)</a> have been processed. It is a crude
       way to wait until "all" hardware has been discovered. Services
       may pull in this service and order themselves after it to wait
       for the udev queue to be empty.

       <i>Using this service is not recommended.</i>  There can be no guarantee
       that hardware is fully discovered at any specific time, because
       the kernel does hardware detection asynchronously, and certain
       buses and devices take a very long time to become ready, and also
       additional hardware may be plugged in at any time. Instead,
       services should subscribe to udev events and react to any new
       hardware as it is discovered. Services that, based on
       configuration, expect certain devices to appear, may warn or
       report failure after a timeout. This timeout should be tailored
       to the hardware type. Waiting for systemd-udev-settle.service
       usually slows boot significantly, because it means waiting for
       all unrelated events too.
