DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>iptunnel </b>command creates configured tunnels for sending and
       receiving IPv6 or IPv4 packets that are encapsulated as the
       payload of an IPv4 datagram.

       The <b>iptunnel </b>command can perform one of the following operations:

       <b>create </b>- create a tunnel interface, which you must subsequently
       configure.

       <b>change </b>- change an existing tunnel interface.

       <b>delete </b>- delete a tunnel interface. You must disable the tunnel
       before you can delete it.

       <b>show </b>- show the tunnel attributes (name, tunnel end points, next
       hop for tunneled packets).
