</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_tty_audit - Enable or disable TTY auditing for specified
       users
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_tty_audit.so </b>[disable=<i>patterns</i>] [enable=<i>patterns</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_tty_audit PAM module is used to enable or disable TTY
       auditing. By default, the kernel does not audit input on any TTY.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>disable=</b><i>patterns</i>
           For each user matching <i>patterns</i>, disable TTY auditing. This
           overrides any previous <b>enable </b>option matching the same user
           name on the command line. See NOTES for further description
           of <i>patterns</i>.

       <b>enable=</b><i>patterns</i>
           For each user matching <i>patterns</i>, enable TTY auditing. This
           overrides any previous <b>disable </b>option matching the same user
           name on the command line. See NOTES for further description
           of <i>patterns</i>.

       <b>open_only</b>
           Set the TTY audit flag when opening the session, but do not
           restore it when closing the session. Using this option is
           necessary for some services that don't <b>fork() </b>to run the
           authenticated session, such as <b>sudo</b>.

       <b>log_passwd</b>
           Log keystrokes when ECHO mode is off but ICANON mode is
           active. This is the mode in which the tty is placed during
           password entry. By default, passwords are not logged. This
           option may not be available on older kernels (3.9?).
</pre> <h2>
MODULE TYPES PROVIDED </h2>
<pre>
       Only the <b>session </b>type is supported.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_SESSION_ERR
           Error reading or modifying the TTY audit flag. See the system
           log for more details.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           Success.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       When TTY auditing is enabled, it is inherited by all processes
       started by that user. In particular, daemons restarted by a user
       will still have TTY auditing enabled, and audit TTY input even by
       other users unless auditing for these users is explicitly
       disabled. Therefore, it is recommended to use <b>disable=* </b>as the
       first option for most daemons using PAM.

       To view the data that was logged by the kernel to audit use the
       command <b>aureport --tty</b>.

       The <i>patterns</i> are comma separated lists of glob patterns or ranges
       of uids. A range is specified as <i>min_uid</i>:<i>max_uid</i> where one of
       these values can be empty. If <i>min_uid</i> is empty only user with the
       uid <i>max_uid</i> will be matched. If <i>max_uid</i> is empty users with the
       uid greater than or equal to <i>min_uid</i> will be matched.

       Please note that passwords in some circumstances may be logged by
       TTY auditing even if the <b>log_passwd </b>is not used. For example, all
       input to an ssh session will be logged - even if there is a
       password being typed into some software running at the remote
       host because only the local TTY state affects the local TTY
       auditing.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Audit all administrative actions.
