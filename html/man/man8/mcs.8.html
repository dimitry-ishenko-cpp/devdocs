NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mcs - Multi-Category System
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       MCS (Multiple Category System) allows users to label files on
       their system within administrator defined categories.  It then
       uses SELinux Mandatory Access Control to protect those files.
       MCS is a discretionary model to allow users to mark their data
       with additional tags that further restrict access.  The only
       mandatory aspect is authorizing users for categories by defining
       their clearance in policy.  However, MCS is similar to MLS and
       exercises the same code paths and share the same support
       infrastructure.  They just differ in their specific
       configuration.

       The <i>/etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/setrans.conf configuration file</i>
       <i>translates the labels on disk to human</i> readable form.
       Administrators can define any labels they want in this file.
       Certain applications like printing and auditing will use these
       labels to identify the files.  By setting a category on a file
       you will prevent other applications/services from having access
       to the files.

       Examples of file labels would be PatientRecord,
       CompanyConfidential etc.
