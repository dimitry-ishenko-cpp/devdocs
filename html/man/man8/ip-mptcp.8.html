DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       MPTCP is a transport protocol built on top of TCP that allows TCP
       connections to use multiple paths to maximize resource usage and
       increase redundancy. The ip-mptcp sub-commands allow configuring
       several aspects of the MPTCP path manager, which is in charge of
       subflows creation:

       The <b>endpoint </b>object specifies the IP addresses that will be used
       and/or announced for additional subflows:

       ip mptcp endpoint add      add new MPTCP endpoint
       ip mptcp endpoint delete   delete existing MPTCP endpoint
       ip mptcp endpoint show     get existing MPTCP endpoint
       ip mptcp endpoint flush    flush all existing MPTCP endpoints

       <i>IFADDR</i> An IPv4 or IPv6 address. When used with the <b>delete id</b>
              operation, an <b>IFADDR </b>is only included when the <b>ID </b>is 0.

       <i>PORT</i>   When a port number is specified, incoming MPTCP subflows
              for already established MPTCP sockets will be accepted on
              the specified port, regardless the original listener port
              accepting the first MPTCP subflow and/or this peer being
              actually on the client side.

       <i>ID</i>     is a unique numeric identifier for the given endpoint

       <b>signal </b>The endpoint will be announced/signaled to each peer via
              an MPTCP ADD_ADDR sub-option. Upon reception of an
              ADD_ADDR sub-option, the peer can try to create additional
              subflows, see <b>ADD_ADDR_ACCEPTED_NR.</b>

       <b>subflow</b>
              If additional subflow creation is allowed by the MPTCP
              limits, the MPTCP path manager will try to create an
              additional subflow using this endpoint as the source
              address after the MPTCP connection is established.

       <b>backup </b>If this is a <b>subflow </b>endpoint, the subflows created using
              this endpoint will have the backup flag set during the
              connection process. This flag instructs the peer to only
              send data on a given subflow when all non-backup subflows
              are unavailable. This does not affect outgoing data, where
              subflow priority is determined by the backup/non-backup
              flag received from the peer

       <b>fullmesh</b>
              If this is a <b>subflow </b>endpoint and additional subflow
              creation is allowed by the MPTCP limits, the MPTCP path
              manager will try to create an additional subflow for each
              known peer address, using this endpoint as the source
              address. This will occur after the MPTCP connection is
              established. If the peer did not announce any additional
              addresses using the MPTCP ADD_ADDR sub-option, this will
              behave the same as a plain <b>subflow </b>endpoint. When the peer
              does announce addresses, each received ADD_ADDR sub-option
              will trigger creation of an additional subflow to generate
              a full mesh topology.

       <b>implicit</b>
              In some scenarios, an MPTCP <b>subflow </b>can use a local
              address mapped by a implicit endpoint created by the in-
              kernel path manager. Once set, the implicit flag cannot be
              removed, but other flags can be added to the endpoint.
              Implicit endpoints cannot be created from user-space.

       The <b>limits </b>object specifies the constraints for subflow
       creations:

       ip mptcp limits show   get current MPTCP subflow creation limits
       ip mptcp limits set    change the MPTCP subflow creation limits

       <i>SUBFLOW_NR</i>
              specifies the maximum number of additional subflows
              allowed for each MPTCP connection. Additional subflows can
              be created due to: incoming accepted ADD_ADDR sub-option,
              local <b>subflow </b>endpoints, additional subflows started by
              the peer.

       <i>ADD_ADDR_ACCEPTED_NR</i>
              specifies the maximum number of incoming ADD_ADDR sub-
              options accepted for each MPTCP connection. After
              receiving the specified number of ADD_ADDR sub-options,
              any other incoming one will be ignored for the MPTCP
              connection lifetime. When an ADD_ADDR sub-option is
              accepted and there are no local <i>fullmesh</i> endpoints, the
              MPTCP path manager will try to create a new subflow using
              the address in the ADD_ADDR sub-option as the destination
              address and a source address determined using local
              routing resolution When <i>fullmesh</i> endpoints are available,
              the MPTCP path manager will try to create new subflows
              using each <i>fullmesh</i> endpoint as a source address and the
              peer's ADD_ADDR address as the destination.  In both cases
              the <i>SUBFLOW_NR</i> limit is enforced.

       <b>monitor </b>displays creation and deletion of MPTCP connections as
       well as addition or removal of remote addresses and subflows.
