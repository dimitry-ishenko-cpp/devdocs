</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>actions </b>object in <b>tc </b>allows a user to define actions
       independently of a classifier (filter). These actions can then be
       assigned to one or more filters, with any packets matching the
       classifier's criteria having that action performed on them.

       Each action type (mirred, police, etc.) will have its own table
       to store all created actions.
</pre> <h2>
OPERATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>add    </b>Create a new action in that action's table.

       <b>change</b>
       <b>replace</b>
              Make modifications to an existing action.

       <b>get    </b>Display the action with the specified index value. When
              combined with the <b>-s </b>option for <b>tc</b>, display the statistics
              for that action.

       <b>delete </b>Delete the action with the specified index value. If the
              action is already associated with a classifier, it does
              not delete the classifier.

       <b>ls</b>
       <b>list   </b>List all the actions in the specified table. When combined
              with the <b>-s </b>option for <b>tc</b>, display the statistics for all
              actions in the specified table.  When combined with the
              option <b>since </b>allows doing a millisecond time-filter since
              the last time an action was used in the datapath.

       <b>flush  </b>Delete all actions stored in the specified table.
</pre> <h2>
ACTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Note that these options are available to all action types.

       <b>index </b><i>INDEX</i>
              Specify the table index value of an action.  <i>INDEX</i> is a
              32-bit value that is unique to the specific type of action
              referenced.

              For <b>add</b>, <b>change</b>, and <b>replace </b>operations, the index is
              <b>optional.  </b>When adding a new action, specifying an index
              value will assign the action to that index unless that
              index value has already been assigned. Omitting the index
              value for an add operation will cause the kernel to assign
              a value to the new action.

              For <b>get </b>and <b>delete </b>operations, the index is <b>required </b>to
              identify the specific action to be displayed or deleted.

       <b>cookie </b><i>COOKIE</i>
              In addition to the specific action, mark the matching
              packet with the value specified by <i>COOKIE</i>.  The <i>COOKIE</i> is
              a 128-bit value that will not be interpreted by the kernel
              whatsoever.  As such, it can be used as a correlating
              value for maintaining user state.  The value to be stored
              is completely arbitrary and does not require a specific
              format. It is stored inside the action structure itself.

       <i>FLAGS</i>  Action-specific flags. Currently, the only supported flag
              is <i>no_percpu</i> which indicates that action is expected to
              have minimal software data-path traffic and doesn't need
              to allocate stat counters with percpu allocator.  This
              option is intended to be used by hardware-offloaded
              actions.

       <b>hw_stats </b><i>HW_STATS</i>
              Specifies the type of HW stats of new action. If omitted,
              any stats counter type is going to be used, according to
              driver and its resources.  The <i>HW_STATS</i> indicates the
              type. Any of the following are valid:

              <b>immediate</b>
                     Means that in dump, user gets the current HW stats
                     state from the device queried at the dump time.

              <b>delayed</b>
                     Means that in dump, user gets HW stats that might
                     be out of date for some time, maybe couple of
                     seconds. This is the case when driver polls stats
                     updates periodically or when it gets async stats
                     update from the device.

              <b>disabled</b>
                     No HW stats are going to be available in dump.

       <b>since </b><i>MSTIME</i>
              When dumping large number of actions, a millisecond time-
              filter can be specified <i>MSTIME</i>.  The <i>MSTIME</i> is a
              millisecond count since last time a packet hit the action.
              As an example specifying "since 20000" implies to dump all
              actions that have seen packets in the last 20 seconds.
              This option is useful when the kernel has a large number
              of actions and you are only interested in recently used
              actions.

       <i>CONTROL</i>
              The <i>CONTROL</i> indicates how <b>tc </b>should proceed after
              executing the action. Any of the following are valid:

              <b>reclassify</b>
                     Restart the classifiction by jumping back to the
                     first filter attached to the action's parent.

              <b>pipe   </b>Continue with the next action. This is the default
                     control.

              <b>drop   </b>Drop the packed without running any further
                     actions.

              <b>continue</b>
                     Continue the classification with the next filter.

              <b>pass   </b>Return to the calling qdisc for packet processing,
                     and end classification of this packet.

       <i>SKIPSPEC</i>
              The <i>SKIPSPEC</i> indicates how <b>tc </b>should proceed when
              executing the action. Any of the following are valid:

              <b>skip_sw</b>
                     Do not process action by software. If hardware has
                     no offload support for this action, operation will
                     fail.

              <b>skip_hw</b>
                     Do not process action by hardware.
