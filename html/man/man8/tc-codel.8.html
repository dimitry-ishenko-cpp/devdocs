NAME </h2>

       CoDel - Controlled-Delay Active Queue Management algorithm
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tc qdisc ... codel </b>[ <b>limit </b>PACKETS ] [ <b>target </b>TIME ] [ <b>interval</b>
       TIME ] [ <b>ecn </b>| <b>noecn </b>] [ <b>ce_threshold </b>TIME ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       CoDel (pronounced "coddle") is an adaptive "no-knobs" active
       queue management algorithm (AQM) scheme that was developed to
       address the shortcomings of RED and its variants. It was
       developed with the following goals in mind:
        o It should be parameterless.
        o It should keep delays low while permitting bursts of traffic.
        o It should control delay.
        o It should adapt dynamically to changing link rates with no
       impact on utilization.
        o It should be simple and efficient and should scale from simple
       to complex routers.
</pre> <h2>
ALGORITHM </h2>
<pre>
       CoDel comes with three major innovations. Instead of using queue
       size or queue average, it uses the local minimum queue as a
       measure of the standing/persistent queue.  Second, it uses a
       single state-tracking variable of the minimum delay to see where
       it is relative to the standing queue delay. Third, instead of
       measuring queue size in bytes or packets, it is measured in
       packet-sojourn time in the queue.

       CoDel measures the minimum local queue delay (i.e. standing queue
       delay) and compares it to the value of the given acceptable queue
       delay <b>target.  </b>As long as the minimum queue delay is less than
       <b>target </b>or the buffer contains fewer than MTU worth of bytes,
       packets are not dropped.  Codel enters a dropping mode when the
       minimum queue delay has exceeded <b>target </b>for a time greater than
       <b>interval.  </b>In this mode, packets are dropped at different drop
       times which is set by a control law. The control law ensures that
       the packet drops cause a linear change in the throughput. Once
       the minimum delay goes below <b>target, </b>packets are no longer
       dropped.

       Additional details can be found in the paper cited below.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>limit</b>
       hard limit on the real queue size. When this limit is reached,
       incoming packets are dropped. If the value is lowered, packets
       are dropped so that the new limit is met. Default is 1000
       packets.

   <b>target</b>
       is the acceptable minimum standing/persistent queue delay. This
       minimum delay is identified by tracking the local minimum queue
       delay that packets experience.  Default and recommended value is
       5ms.

   <b>interval</b>
       is used to ensure that the measured minimum delay does not become
       too stale. The minimum delay must be experienced in the last
       epoch of length <b>interval.  </b>It should be set on the order of the
       worst-case RTT through the bottleneck to give endpoints
       sufficient time to react. Default value is 100ms.

   <b>ecn | noecn</b>
       can be used to mark packets instead of dropping them. If <b>ecn </b>has
       been enabled, <b>noecn </b>can be used to turn it off and vice-a-versa.
       By default, <b>ecn </b>is turned off.

   <b>ce_threshold</b>
       sets a threshold above which all packets are marked with ECN
       Congestion Experienced. This is useful for DCTCP-style congestion
       control algorithms that require marking at very shallow queueing
       thresholds.
