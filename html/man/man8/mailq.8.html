</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>smtpctl</b>, <b>mailq </b>— control the SMTP daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>smtpctl</b>, <i>command</i> [<i>argument ...</i>] <b>mailq</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>smtpctl</b>, program controls <i>smtpd</i>(8).  Commands may be
       abbreviated to the minimum unambiguous prefix; for example, <b>sh ro</b>
       for <b>show routes</b>.

       The <b>mailq </b>command is provided for compatibility with other MTAs
       and is simply a shortcut for <b>show queue</b>.

       The following commands are available:

       <b>discover </b><i>envelope-id</i> | <i>message-id</i>
               Schedule a single envelope, or all envelopes with the
               same message ID that were manually moved to the queue.

       <b>encrypt </b>[<i>string</i>]
               Encrypt the password <i>string</i> to a representation suitable
               for user credentials and print it to the standard output.
               If <i>string</i> is not provided, cleartext passwords are read
               from standard input.

               It is advised to avoid providing the password as a
               parameter as it will be visible from <i>top</i>(1) and <i>ps</i>(1)
               output.

       <b>log brief</b>
               Disable verbose debug logging.

       <b>log verbose</b>
               Enable verbose debug logging.

       <b>monitor</b>
               Display updates of some <i>smtpd</i>(8) internal counters in one
               second intervals.  Each line reports the increment of all
               counters since the last update, except for some counters
               which are always absolute values.  The first line reports
               the current value of each counter.  The fields are:

               <b>•   </b>Current number of active SMTP clients (absolute
                   value).
               <b>•   </b>New SMTP clients.
               <b>•   </b>Disconnected clients.
               <b>•   </b>Current number of envelopes in the queue (absolute
                   value).
               <b>•   </b>Newly enqueued envelopes.
               <b>•   </b>Dequeued envelopes.
               <b>•   </b>Successful deliveries.
               <b>•   </b>Temporary failures.
               <b>•   </b>Permanent failures.
               <b>•   </b>Message loops.
               <b>•   </b>Expired envelopes.
               <b>•   </b>Envelopes removed by the administrator.
               <b>•   </b>Generated bounces.

       <b>pause envelope </b><i>envelope-id</i> | <i>message-id</i> | <b>all</b>
               Temporarily suspend scheduling for the envelope with the
               given ID, envelopes with the given message ID, or all
               envelopes.

       <b>pause mda</b>
               Temporarily stop deliveries to local users.

       <b>pause mta</b>
               Temporarily stop relaying and deliveries to remote users.

       <b>pause smtp</b>
               Temporarily stop accepting incoming sessions.

       <b>profile </b><i>subsystem</i>
               Enables real-time profiling of <i>subsystem</i>.  Supported
               subsystems are:

               <b>•   </b>queue, to profile cost of queue IO
               <b>•   </b>imsg, to profile cost of event handlers

       <b>remove </b><i>envelope-id</i> | <i>message-id</i> | <b>all</b>
               Remove a single envelope, envelopes with the given
               message ID, or all envelopes.

       <b>resume envelope </b><i>envelope-id</i> | <i>message-id</i> | <b>all</b>
               Resume scheduling for the envelope with the given ID,
               envelopes with the given message ID, or all envelopes.

       <b>resume mda</b>
               Resume deliveries to local users.

               Display envelope content for the given ID.

       <b>show hosts</b>
               Display the list of known remote MX hosts.  For each of
               them, it shows the IP address, the canonical hostname, a

               following fields, separated by a "|":

               <b>•   </b>Domain.
               <b>•   </b>Unix timestamp of last delivery.

       <b>show queue</b>
               Display information concerning envelopes that are
               currently in the queue.  Each line of output describes a
               single envelope.  It consists of the following fields,
               separated by a "|":

               <b>•   </b>Envelope ID.
               <b>•   </b>Address family of the client which enqueued the mail.

               <b>•   </b>The destination address.
               <b>•   </b>Time of creation.
               <b>•   </b>Time of expiration.
               <b>•   </b>Time of last delivery or relaying attempt.
               <b>•   </b>Number of delivery or relaying attempts.
               <b>•   </b>Current runstate: either "pending" or "inflight" if
                   <i>smtpd</i>(8) is running, or "offline" otherwise.
               <b>•   </b>Delay in seconds before the next attempt if pending,
                   or time elapsed if currently running.  This field is
                   blank if <i>smtpd</i>(8) is not running.
               <b>•   </b>Error string for the last failed delivery or relay
                   attempt.

       <b>show relays</b>
               Display the list of currently active relays and
               associated connectors.  For each relay, it shows a number
               of counters and information on its internal state on a
               single line.  Then comes the list of connectors (source
               addresses to connect from for this relay).

       <b>show routes</b>
               Display status of routes currently known by <i>smtpd</i>(8).
               Each line consists of a route number, a source address, a
               destination address, a set of flags, the number of
               connections on this route, the current penalty level
               which determines the amount of time the route is disabled
               if an error occurs, and the delay before it gets
               reactivated.  The following flags are defined:

               D   The route is currently disabled.
               N   The route is new.  No SMTP session has been
                   established yet.
               Q   The route has a timeout registered to lower its
                   penalty level and possibly reactivate or discard it.

       <b>show stats</b>
               Displays runtime statistics concerning <i>smtpd</i>(8).

       <b>show status</b>
               Shows if MTA, MDA and SMTP systems are currently running
               or paused.

       <b>spf walk</b>
               Recursively look up SPF records for the domains read from
               stdin.  For example:

                     $ smtpctl spf walk &lt; domains.txt

               SPF records may contain macros which cannot be included
               in a static list and must be resolved dynamically at
               connection time.  <b>spf walk </b>cannot provide full results in
               these cases.

       <b>trace </b><i>subsystem</i>
               Enables real-time tracing of <i>subsystem</i>.  Supported
               subsystems are:

               <b>•   </b>imsg
               <b>•   </b>io
               <b>•   </b>smtp (incoming sessions)
               <b>•   </b>filters
               <b>•   </b>mta (outgoing sessions)
               <b>•   </b>bounce
               <b>•   </b>scheduler
               <b>•   </b>expand (aliases/virtual/forward expansion)
               <b>•   </b>lookup (user/credentials lookups)
               <b>•   </b>stat
               <b>•   </b>rules (matched by incoming sessions)
               <b>•   </b>mproc
               <b>•   </b>all

       <b>unprofile </b><i>subsystem</i>
               Disables real-time profiling of <i>subsystem</i>.

       <b>untrace </b><i>subsystem</i>
               Disables real-time tracing of <i>subsystem</i>.

       <b>update table </b><i>name</i>
               Updates the contents of table <i>name</i>, for tables using the
               “file” backend.

       When <b>smtpd </b>receives a message, it generates a <i>message-id</i> for the
       message, and one <i>envelope-id</i> per recipient.  The <i>message-id</i> is a
       32-bit random identifier that is guaranteed to be unique on the
       host system.  The <i>envelope-id</i> is a 64-bit unique identifier that
       encodes the <i>message-id</i> in the 32 upper bits and a random envelope
       identifier in the 32 lower bits.

       A command which specifies a <i>message-id</i> applies to all recipients
       of a message; a command which specifies an <i>envelope-id</i> applies to
       a specific recipient of a message.
