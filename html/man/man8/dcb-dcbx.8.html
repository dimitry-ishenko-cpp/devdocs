       <b>dcb </b>[ <i>OPTIONS</i> ] <b>dcbx </b>{ <i>COMMAND</i> | <i>help</i> }

       <b>dcb dcbx show dev </b>DEV

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Data Center Bridging eXchange (DCBX) is a protocol used by DCB
       devices to exchange configuration information with directly
       connected peers. The Linux DCBX object is a 1-byte bitfield of
       flags that configure whether DCBX is implemented in the device or
       in the host, and which version of the protocol should be used.
       <b>dcb dcbx </b>is used to access the per-port Linux DCBX object.

       There are two principal modes of operation: in <b>host </b>mode, DCBX
       protocol is implemented by the host LLDP agent, and the DCB
       interfaces are used to propagate the negotiate parameters to
       capable devices. In <b>lld-managed </b>mode, the configuration is
       handled by the device, and DCB interfaces are used for inspection
       of negotiated parameters, and can also be used to set initial
       parameters.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
       When used with <b>dcb dcbx set, </b>the following keywords enable the
       corresponding configuration. The keywords that are not mentioned
       on the command line are considered disabled. When used with <b>show,</b>
       each enabled feature is shown by its corresponding keyword.

       <b>host</b>
       <b>lld-managed</b>
              The device is in the host mode of operation and,
              respectively, the lld-managed mode of operation, as
              described above. In principle these two keywords are
              mutually exclusive, but <b>dcb dcbx </b>allows setting both and
              lets the driver handle it as appropriate.

       <b>cee</b>
       <b>ieee   </b>The device supports CEE (Converged Enhanced Ethernet) and,
              respectively, IEEE version of the DCB specification.
              Typically only one of these will be set, but <b>dcb dcbx </b>does
              not mandate this.

       <b>static </b>indicates the engine supports static configuration. No
              actual negotiation is performed, negotiated parameters are
              always the initial configuration.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE &amp; USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Put the DCB engine into the "host" mode of operation, and use
       IEEE-standardized DCB interfaces:

       # dcb dcbx set dev eth0 host ieee

       Show what was set:

       # dcb dcbx show dev eth0
       host ieee
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive integer
       upon failure.
