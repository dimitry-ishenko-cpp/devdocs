NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cgroup - control group based traffic control filter
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tc filter </b>... <b>cgroup </b>[ <b>match </b><i>EMATCH_TREE</i> ] [ <b>action </b><i>ACTION_SPEC</i> ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This filter serves as a hint to <b>tc </b>that the assigned class ID of
       the net_cls control group the process the packet originates from
       belongs to should be used for classification. Obviously, it is
       useful for locally generated packets only.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>action </b><i>ACTION_SPEC</i>
              Apply an action from the generic actions framework on
              matching packets.

       <b>match </b><i>EMATCH_TREE</i>
              Match packets using the extended match infrastructure. See
              <a href="tc-ematch.8.html">tc-ematch(8)</a> for a detailed description of the allowed
              syntax in <i>EMATCH_TREE</i>.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       In order to use this filter, a net_cls control group has to be
       created first and class as well as process ID(s) assigned to it.
       The following creates a net_cls cgroup named "foobar":

              modprobe cls_cgroup
              mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls
              mount -t cgroup -onet_cls net_cls /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls
              mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/foobar

       To assign a class ID to the created cgroup, a file named
       <i>net_cls.classid</i> has to be created which contains the class ID to
       be assigned as a hexadecimal, 64bit wide number. The upper 32bits
       are reserved for the major handle, the remaining hold the minor.
       So a class ID of e.g.  <b>ff:be </b>has to be written like so: <b>0xff00be</b>
       (leading zeroes may be omitted). To continue the above example,
       the following assigns class ID 1:2 to foobar cgroup:

              echo 0x10002 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/foobar/net_cls.classid

       Finally some PIDs can be assigned to the given cgroup:

              echo 1234 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/foobar/tasks
              echo 5678 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/foobar/tasks

       Now by simply attaching a <b>cgroup </b>filter to a <b>qdisc </b>makes packets
       from PIDs 1234 and 5678 be pushed into class 1:2.
