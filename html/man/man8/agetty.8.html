NAME </h2>
<pre>
       agetty - alternative Linux getty
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>agetty </b>[options] <i>port</i> [<i>baud_rate</i>...] [<i>term</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>agetty </b>opens a tty port, prompts for a login name and invokes the
       /bin/login command. It is normally invoked by <b>init</b>(8).

       <b>agetty </b>has several <i>non-standard</i> features that are useful for
       hardwired and for dial-in lines:

       •   Adapts the tty settings to parity bits and to erase, kill,
           end-of-line and uppercase characters when it reads a login
           name. The program can handle 7-bit characters with even, odd,
           none or space parity, and 8-bit characters with no parity.
           The following special characters are recognized: Control-U
           (kill); DEL and backspace (erase); carriage return and line
           feed (end of line). See also the <b>--erase-chars </b>and
           <b>--kill-chars </b>options.

       •   Optionally deduces the baud rate from the CONNECT messages
           produced by Hayes(tm)-compatible modems.

       •   Optionally does not hang up when it is given an already
           opened line (useful for call-back applications).

       •   Optionally does not display the contents of the <i>/etc/issue</i>
           file.

       •   Optionally displays an alternative issue files or directories
           instead of <i>/etc/issue</i> or <i>/etc/issue.d</i>.

       •   Optionally does not ask for a login name.

       •   Optionally invokes a non-standard login program instead of
           <i>/bin/login</i>.

       •   Optionally turns on hardware flow control.

       •   Optionally forces the line to be local with no need for
           carrier detect.

       This program does not use the <i>/etc/gettydefs</i> (System V) or
       <i>/etc/gettytab</i> (SunOS 4) files.
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>port</i>
           A path name relative to the <i>/dev</i> directory. If a "-" is
           specified, <b>agetty </b>assumes that its standard input is already
           connected to a tty port and that a connection to a remote
           user has already been established.

           Under System V, a "-" <i>port</i> argument should be preceded by a
           "--".

       <i>baud_rate</i>,...
           A comma-separated list of one or more baud rates. Each time
           <b>agetty </b>receives a BREAK character it advances through the
           list, which is treated as if it were circular.

           Baud rates should be specified in descending order, so that
           the null character (Ctrl-@) can also be used for baud-rate
           switching.

           This argument is optional and unnecessary for <b>virtual</b>
           <b>terminals</b>.

           The default for <b>serial terminals </b>is keep the current baud
           rate (see <b>--keep-baud</b>) and if unsuccessful then default to
           '9600'.

       <i>term</i>
           The value to be used for the <b>TERM </b>environment variable. This
           overrides whatever <a href="../man1/init.1.html">init(1)</a> may have set, and is inherited by
           login and the shell.

           The default is 'vt100', or 'linux' for Linux on a virtual
           terminal, or 'hurd' for GNU Hurd on a virtual terminal.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-8</b>, <b>--8bits</b>
           Assume that the tty is 8-bit clean, hence disable parity
           detection.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--autologin </b><i>username</i>
           Automatically log in the specified user without asking for a
           username or password. Using this option causes an <b>-f </b><i>username</i>
           option and argument to be added to the <b>/bin/login </b>command
           line. See <b>--login-options</b>, which can be used to modify this
           option’s behavior.

           Note that <b>--autologin </b>may affect the way in which <b>getty</b>
           initializes the serial line, because on auto-login <b>agetty</b>
           does not read from the line and it has no opportunity
           optimize the line setting.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--noreset</b>
           Do not reset terminal cflags (control modes). See <a href="../man3/termios.3.html">termios(3)</a>
           for more details.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--remote</b>
           Typically the <a href="../man1/login.1.html">login(1)</a> command is given a remote hostname
           when called by something such as <b>telnetd</b>(8). This option
           allows <b>agetty </b>to pass what it is using for a hostname to
           <a href="../man1/login.1.html">login(1)</a> for use in <a href="../man5/utmp.5.html">utmp(5)</a>. See <b>--host</b>, <a href="../man1/login.1.html">login(1)</a>, and
           <a href="../man5/utmp.5.html">utmp(5)</a>.

           If the <b>--host </b><i>fakehost</i> option is given, then an <b>-h </b><i>fakehost</i>
           option and argument are added to the <i>/bin/login</i> command line.

           If the <b>--nohostname </b>option is given, then an <b>-H </b>option is
           added to the <b>/bin/login </b>command line.

           See <b>--login-options</b>.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--issue-file </b><i>path</i>
           Specifies a ":" delimited list of files and directories to be
           displayed instead of <i>/etc/issue</i> (or other). All specified
           files and directories are displayed, missing or empty files
           are silently ignored. If the specified path is a directory
           then display all files with <i>.issue</i> file extension in
           version-sort order from the directory. This allows custom
           messages to be displayed on different terminals. The
           <b>--noissue </b>option will override this option.

       <b>--show-issue</b>
           Display the current issue file (or other) on the current
           terminal and exit. Use this option to review the current
           setting, it is not designed for any other purpose. Note that
           output may use some default or incomplete information as
           proper output depends on terminal and <b>agetty </b>command line.

       <b>-h, --flow-control</b>
           Enable hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control. It is left up to the
           application to disable software (XON/XOFF) flow protocol
           where appropriate.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host </b><i>fakehost</i>
           Write the specified <i>fakehost</i> into the utmp file. Normally, no
           login host is given, since <b>agetty </b>is used for local hardwired
           connections and consoles. However, this option can be useful
           for identifying terminal concentrators and the like.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--noissue</b>
           Do not display the contents of <i>/etc/issue</i> (or other) before
           writing the login prompt. Terminals or communications
           hardware may become confused when receiving lots of text at
           the wrong baud rate; dial-up scripts may fail if the login
           prompt is preceded by too much text.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--init-string </b><i>initstring</i>
           Set an initial string to be sent to the tty or modem before
           sending anything else. This may be used to initialize a
           modem. Non-printable characters may be sent by writing their
           octal code preceded by a backslash (\). For example, to send
           a linefeed character (ASCII 10, octal 012), write \12.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--noclear</b>
           Do not clear the screen before prompting for the login name.
           By default the screen is cleared.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--login-program </b><i>login_program</i>
           Invoke the specified <i>login_program</i> instead of /bin/login.
           This allows the use of a non-standard login program. Such a
           program could, for example, ask for a dial-up password or use
           a different password file. See <b>--login-options</b>.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--local-line</b>[=<i>mode</i>]
           Control the CLOCAL line flag. The optional <i>mode</i> argument is
           <b>auto</b>, <b>always </b>or <b>never</b>. If the <i>mode</i> argument is omitted, then
           the default is <b>always</b>. If the <b>--local-line </b>option is not
           given at all, then the default is <b>auto</b>.

           <i>always</i>
               Forces the line to be a local line with no need for
               carrier detect. This can be useful when you have a
               locally attached terminal where the serial line does not
               set the carrier-detect signal.

           <i>never</i>
               Explicitly clears the CLOCAL flag from the line setting
               and the carrier-detect signal is expected on the line.

           <i>auto</i>
               The <b>agetty </b>default. Does not modify the CLOCAL setting
               and follows the setting enabled by the kernel.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--extract-baud</b>
           Try to extract the baud rate from the CONNECT status message
           produced by Hayes(tm)-compatible modems. These status
           messages are of the form: "&lt;junk&gt;&lt;speed&gt;&lt;junk&gt;". <b>agetty</b>
           assumes that the modem emits its status message at the same
           speed as specified with (the first) <i>baud_rate</i> value on the
           command line.

           Since the <b>--extract-baud </b>feature may fail on heavily-loaded
           systems, you still should enable BREAK processing by
           enumerating all expected baud rates on the command line.

       <b>--list-speeds</b>
           Display supported baud rates. These are determined at
           compilation time.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--skip-login</b>
           Do not prompt the user for a login name. This can be used in
           connection with the <b>--login-program </b>option to invoke a
           non-standard login process such as a BBS system. Note that
           with the <b>--skip-login </b>option, <b>agetty </b>gets no input from the
           user who logs in and therefore will not be able to figure out
           parity, character size, and newline processing of the
           connection. It defaults to space parity, 7 bit characters,
           and ASCII CR (13) end-of-line character. Beware that the
           program that <b>agetty </b>starts (usually /bin/login) is run as
           root.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--nonewline</b>
           Do not print a newline before writing out <i>/etc/issue</i>.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--login-options </b><i>login_options</i>
           Options and arguments that are passed to <a href="../man1/login.1.html">login(1)</a>. Where \u
           is replaced by the login name. For example:

           <b>--login-options '-h darkstar -- \u'</b>

           See <b>--autologin</b>, <b>--login-program </b>and <b>--remote</b>.

           Please read the <b>SECURITY NOTICE </b>below before using this
           option.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--login-pause</b>
           Wait for any key before dropping to the login prompt. Can be
           combined with <b>--autologin </b>to save memory by lazily spawning
           shells.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--chroot </b><i>directory</i>
           Change root to the specified directory.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--hangup</b>
           Call <a href="../man2/vhangup.2.html">vhangup(2)</a> to do a virtual hangup of the specified
           terminal.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--keep-baud</b>
           Try to keep the existing baud rate. The baud rates from the
           command line are used when <b>agetty </b>receives a BREAK character.
           If another baud rates specified then the original baud rate
           is also saved to the end of the wanted baud rates list. This
           can be used to return to the original baud rate after
           unexpected BREAKs.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout </b><i>timeout</i>
           Terminate if no user name could be read within <i>timeout</i>
           seconds. Use of this option with hardwired terminal lines is
           not recommended.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--detect-case</b>
           Turn on support for detecting an uppercase-only terminal.
           This setting will detect a login name containing only
           capitals as indicating an uppercase-only terminal and turn on
           some upper-to-lower case conversions. Note that this has no
           support for any Unicode characters.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wait-cr</b>
           Wait for the user or the modem to send a carriage-return or a
           linefeed character before sending the <i>/etc/issue</i> file (or
           others) and the login prompt. This is useful with the
           <b>--init-string </b>option.

       <b>--nohints</b>
           Do not print hints about Num, Caps and Scroll Locks.

       <b>--nohostname</b>
           By default the hostname will be printed. With this option
           enabled, no hostname at all will be shown. This setting is
           also possible to able by LOGIN_PLAIN_PROMPT option in the
           <i>/etc/login.defs</i> configuration file (see below for more
           details).

       <b>--long-hostname</b>
           By default the hostname is only printed until the first dot.
           With this option enabled, the fully qualified hostname by
           <b>gethostname</b>(3P) or (if not found) by <a href="../man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo(3)</a> is shown.

       <b>--erase-chars </b><i>string</i>
           This option specifies additional characters that should be
           interpreted as a backspace ("ignore the previous character")
           when the user types the login name. The default additional
           'erase' has been '#', but since util-linux 2.23 no additional
           erase characters are enabled by default.

       <b>--kill-chars </b><i>string</i>
           This option specifies additional characters that should be
           interpreted as a kill ("ignore all previous characters") when
           the user types the login name. The default additional 'kill'
           has been '@', but since util-linux 2.23 no additional kill
           characters are enabled by default.

       <b>--chdir </b><i>directory</i>
           Change directory before the login.

       <b>--delay </b><i>number</i>
           Sleep seconds before open tty.

       <b>--nice </b><i>number</i>
           Run login with this priority.

       <b>--reload</b>
           Ask all running <b>agetty </b>instances to reload and update their
           displayed prompts, if the user has not yet commenced logging
           in. After doing so the command will exit. This feature might
           be unsupported on systems without Linux <a href="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify(7)</a>.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIG FILE ITEMS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>agetty </b>reads the <i>/etc/login.defs</i> configuration file (see
       <a href="../man5/login.defs.5.html">login.defs(5)</a>). Note that the configuration file could be
       distributed with another package (usually shadow-utils). The
       following configuration items are relevant for <b>agetty</b>:

       <b>LOGIN_PLAIN_PROMPT </b>(boolean)
           Tell <b>agetty </b>that printing the hostname should be suppressed
           in the login: prompt. This is an alternative to the
           <b>--nohostname </b>command line option. The default value is <i>no</i>.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       This section shows examples for the process field of an entry in
       the <i>/etc/inittab</i> file. You’ll have to prepend appropriate values
       for the other fields. See <b>inittab</b>(5) for more details.

       For a hardwired line or a console tty:

          <b>/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS1</b>

       For a directly connected terminal without proper carrier-detect
       wiring (try this if your terminal just sleeps instead of giving
       you a password: prompt):

          <b>/sbin/agetty --local-line 9600 ttyS1 vt100</b>

       For an old-style dial-in line with a 9600/2400/1200 baud modem:

          <b>/sbin/agetty --extract-baud --timeout 60 ttyS1</b>
          <b>9600,2400,1200</b>

       For a Hayes modem with a fixed 115200 bps interface to the
       machine (the example init string turns off modem echo and result
       codes, makes modem/computer DCD track modem/modem DCD, makes a
       DTR drop cause a disconnection, and turns on auto-answer after 1
       ring):

          <b>/sbin/agetty --wait-cr --init-string</b>
          <b>'ATE0Q1&amp;D2&amp;C1S0=1\015' 115200 ttyS1</b>
</pre> <h2>
SECURITY NOTICE </h2>
<pre>
       If you use the <b>--login-program </b>and <b>--login-options </b>options, be
       aware that a malicious user may try to enter lognames with
       embedded options, which then get passed to the used login
       program. <b>agetty </b>does check for a leading "-" and makes sure the
       logname gets passed as one parameter (so embedded spaces will not
       create yet another parameter), but depending on how the login
       binary parses the command line that might not be sufficient.
       Check that the used login program cannot be abused this way.

       Some programs use "--" to indicate that the rest of the command
       line should not be interpreted as options. Use this feature if
       available by passing "--" before the username gets passed by \u.
</pre> <h2>
ISSUE FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The default issue file is <i>/etc/issue</i>. If the file exists, then
       <b>agetty </b>also checks for <i>/etc/issue.d</i> directory. The directory is
       optional extension to the default issue file and content of the
       directory is printed after <i>/etc/issue</i> content. If the <i>/etc/issue</i>
       does not exist, then the directory is ignored. All files <b>with</b>
       <b>.issue extension </b>from the directory are printed in version-sort
       order. The directory can be used to maintain 3rd-party messages
       independently on the primary system <i>/etc/issue</i> file.

       Since version 2.35 additional locations for issue file and
       directory are supported. If the default <i>/etc/issue</i> does not
       exist, then <b>agetty </b>checks for <i>/run/issue</i> and <i>/run/issue.d</i>,
       thereafter for <i>/usr/lib/issue</i> and <i>/usr/lib/issue.d</i>. The directory
       <i>/etc</i> is expected for host specific configuration, <i>/run</i> is
       expected for generated stuff and <i>/usr/lib</i> for static distribution
       maintained configuration.

       The default path maybe overridden by <b>--issue-file </b>option. In this
       case specified path has to be file or directory and all the
       default issue file and directory locations are ignored.

       The issue file feature can be completely disabled by <b>--noissue</b>
       option.

       It is possible to review the current issue file by <b>agetty</b>
       <b>--show-issue </b>on the current terminal.

       The issue files may contain certain escape codes to display the
       system name, date, time et cetera. All escape codes consist of a
       backslash (\) immediately followed by one of the characters
       listed below.

       4 or 4{<i>interface</i>}
           Insert the IPv4 address of the specified network interface
           (for example: \4{eth0}). If the <i>interface</i> argument is not
           specified, then select the first fully configured (UP,
           non-LOCALBACK, RUNNING) interface. If no configured interface
           is found, fall back to the IP address of the machine’s
           hostname.

       6 or 6{<i>interface</i>}
           The same as \4 but for IPv6.

       b
           Insert the baudrate of the current line.

       d
           Insert the current date.

       e or e{<i>name</i>}
           Translate the human-readable <i>name</i> to an escape sequence and
           insert it (for example: \e{red}Alert text.\e{reset}). If the
           <i>name</i> argument is not specified, then insert \033. The
           currently supported names are: black, blink, blue, bold,
           brown, cyan, darkgray, gray, green, halfbright, lightblue,
           lightcyan, lightgray, lightgreen, lightmagenta, lightred,
           magenta, red, reset, reverse, yellow and white. All unknown
           names are silently ignored.

           Insert the system name (the name of the operating system).
           Same as 'uname -s'. See also the \S escape code.

       S or S{VARIABLE}
           Insert the VARIABLE data from <i>/etc/os-release</i>. If this file
           does not exist then fall back to <i>/usr/lib/os-release</i>. If the
           VARIABLE argument is not specified, then use PRETTY_NAME from
           the file or the system name (see \s). This escape code can be
           used to keep <i>/etc/issue</i> distribution and release independent.
           Note that \S{ANSI_COLOR} is converted to the real terminal
           escape sequence.

       l
           Insert the name of the current tty line.

       m
           Insert the architecture identifier of the machine. Same as
           <b>uname -m</b>.

       n
           Insert the nodename of the machine, also known as the
           hostname. Same as <b>uname -n</b>.

       o
           Insert the NIS domainname of the machine. Same as <b>hostname</b>
           <b>-d</b>.

       O
           Insert the DNS domainname of the machine.

       r
           Insert the release number of the OS. Same as <b>uname -r</b>.

       t
           Insert the current time.

       u
           Insert the number of current users logged in.

       U
           Insert the string "1 user" or "&lt;n&gt; users" where &lt;n&gt; is the
           number of current users logged in.

       v
           Insert the version of the OS, that is, the build-date and
           such.

       An example. On my system, the following <i>/etc/issue</i> file:

           This is \n.\o (\s \m \r) \t

       displays as:

           This is thingol.orcan.dk (Linux i386 1.1.9) 18:29:30
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/var/run/utmp</i>
           the system status file.

       <i>/etc/issue</i>
           printed before the login prompt.

       <i>/etc/os-release /usr/lib/os-release</i>
           operating system identification data.

       <i>/dev/console</i>
           problem reports (if <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a> is not used).

       <i>/etc/inittab</i>
           <b>init</b>(8) configuration file for SysV-style init daemon.
</pre> <h2>
CREDENTIALS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>agetty </b>supports configuration via systemd credentials (see
       <a href="https://systemd.io/CREDENTIALS/)">https://systemd.io/CREDENTIALS/)</a>. <b>agetty </b>reads the following
       systemd credentials:

       <b>agetty.autologin </b>(string)
           If set, configures <b>agetty </b>to automatically log in the
           specified user without asking for a username or password,
           similarly to the <b>--autologin </b>option.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The baud-rate detection feature (the <b>--extract-baud </b>option)
       requires that <b>agetty </b>be scheduled soon enough after completion of
       a dial-in call (within 30 ms with modems that talk at 2400 baud).
       For robustness, always use the <b>--extract-baud </b>option in
       combination with a multiple baud rate command-line argument, so
       that BREAK processing is enabled.

       The text in the <i>/etc/issue</i> file (or other) and the login prompt
       are always output with 7-bit characters and space parity.

       The baud-rate detection feature (the <b>--extract-baud </b>option)
       requires that the modem emits its status message <i>after</i> raising
       the DCD line.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       Depending on how the program was configured, all diagnostics are
       written to the console device or reported via the <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>
       facility. Error messages are produced if the <i>port</i> argument does
       not specify a terminal device; if there is no utmp entry for the
       current process (System V only); and so on.
