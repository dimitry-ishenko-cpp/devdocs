</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       grpck - verify integrity of group files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>grpck </b>[options] [<i>group</i> [ <i>shadow</i> ]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>grpck </b>command verifies the integrity of the groups
       information. It checks that all entries in /etc/group and
       /etc/gshadow have the proper format and contain valid data. The
       user is prompted to delete entries that are improperly formatted
       or which have other uncorrectable errors.

       Checks are made to verify that each entry has:

       •   the correct number of fields

       •   a unique and valid group name

       •   a valid group identifier (/etc/group only)

       •   a valid list of members and administrators

       •   a corresponding entry in the /etc/gshadow file (respectively
           /etc/group for the gshadow checks)

       The checks for correct number of fields and unique group name are
       fatal. If an entry has the wrong number of fields, the user will
       be prompted to delete the entire line. If the user does not
       answer affirmatively, all further checks are bypassed. An entry
       with a duplicated group name is prompted for deletion, but the
       remaining checks will still be made. All other errors are
       warnings and the user is encouraged to run the <b>groupmod </b>command
       to correct the error.

       The commands which operate on the /etc/group and /etc/gshadow
       files are not able to alter corrupted or duplicated entries.
       <b>grpck </b>should be used in those circumstances to remove the
       offending entries.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-r </b>and <b>-s </b>options cannot be combined.

       The options which apply to the <b>grpck </b>command are:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help message and exit.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--read-only</b>
           Execute the <b>grpck </b>command in read-only mode. This causes all
           questions regarding changes to be answered <i>no</i> without user
           intervention.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root </b><i>CHROOT_DIR</i>
           Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use the
           configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only
           absolute paths are supported.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sort</b>
           Sort entries in /etc/group and /etc/gshadow by GID.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--silence-warnings</b>
           Suppress more controversial warnings, in particular warnings
           about inconsistency between group members listed in
           /etc/group and /etc/ghadow.

       By default, <b>grpck </b>operates on /etc/group and /etc/gshadow. The
       user may select alternate files with the <i>group</i> and <i>shadow</i>
       parameters.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
       the behavior of this tool:

       <b>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP </b>(number)
           Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached,
           a new group entry (line) is started in /etc/group (with the
           same name, same password, and same GID).

           The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in
           the number of members in a group.

           This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of
           lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
           lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters.

           If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

           Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in
           the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable
           unless you really need it.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/group
           Group account information.

       /etc/gshadow

</pre> <h2>

<pre>
       The <b>grpck </b>command exits with the following values:

       <i>0</i>
           success

       <i>1</i>
           invalid command syntax

       <i>2</i>
           one or more bad group entries

       <i>3</i>
           can't open group files
