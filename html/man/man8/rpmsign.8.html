NAME </h2>

       rpmsign - RPM Package Signing
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>SIGNING PACKAGES:</b>
       <b>rpmsign --addsign|--resign </b>[<b>rpmsign-options</b>] <i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       <b>rpmsign --delsign </b><i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       <b>rpmsign --delfilesign </b><i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

   <b>rpmsign-options</b>
       [<b>--rpmv3</b>] [<b>--fskpath </b><i>KEY</i>] [<b>--signfiles</b>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Both of the <b>--addsign </b>and <b>--resign </b>options generate and insert
       new signatures for each package <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> given, replacing any
       existing signatures.  There are two options for historical rea‐
       sons, there is no difference in behavior currently.

       To create a signature rpmsign needs to verify the package's
       checksum.  As a result packages with a MD5/SHA1 checksums cannot
       be signed in FIPS mode.

       <b>rpmsign --delsign </b><i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       Delete all signatures from each package <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> given.

       <b>rpmsign --delfilesign </b><i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       Delete all IMA and fsverity file signatures from each package
       <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> given.

   <b>SIGN OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--rpmv3</b>
              Force RPM V3 header+payload signature addition.  These are
              expensive and redundant baggage on packages where a sepa‐
              rate payload digest exists (packages built with rpm &gt;=
              4.14).  Rpmsign will automatically detect the need for V3
              signatures, but this option can be used to force their
              creation if the packages must be fully signature verifi‐
              able with rpm &lt; 4.14 or other interoperability reasons.

       <b>--fskpath </b><i>KEY</i>
              Used with <b>--signfiles</b>, use file signing key <i>Key</i>.

       <b>--certpath </b><i>CERT</i>
              Used with <b>--signverity</b>, use file signing certificate <i>Cert</i>.

       <b>--verityalgo </b><i>ALG</i>
              Used with <b>--signverity</b>, to specify the signing algorithm.
              sha256 and sha512 are supported, with sha256 being the de‐
              fault if this argument is not specified.  This can also be
              specified with the macro %_verity_algorithm

       <b>--signfiles</b>
              Sign package files.  The macro <b>%_binary_filedigest_algo‐</b>
              <b>rithm </b>must be set to a supported algorithm before building
              the package.  The supported algorithms are SHA1, SHA256,
              SHA384, and SHA512, which are represented as 2, 8, 9, and
              10 respectively.  The file signing key (RSA private key)
              must be set before signing the package, it can be config‐
              ured on the command line with <b>--fskpath </b>or the macro
              %_file_signing_key.

       <b>--signverity</b>
              Sign package files with fsverity signatures.  The file
              signing key (RSA private key) and the signing certificate
              must be set before signing the package.  The key can be
              configured on the command line with <b>--fskpath </b>or the macro
              %_file_signing_key, and the cert can be configured on the
              command line with <b>--certpath </b>or the macro %_file_sign‐
              ing_cert.

   <b>CONFIGURING SIGNING KEYS</b>
       In order to sign packages, you need to create your own public and
       secret key pair (see the GnuPG manual).  In addition, <b>rpm </b>must be
       configured to find GnuPG and the appropriate keys with the fol‐
       lowing macros:

       <b>%_gpg_name</b>
              The name of the "user" whose key you wish to use to sign
              your packages.  Typically this is the only configuration
              needed.

       <b>%_gpg_path</b>
              The location of your GnuPG keyring if not the default
              <b>$GNUPGHOME</b>.

       <b>%__gpg </b>The path of the GnuPG executable.  Normally pre-config‐
              ured.

       For example, to be able to use GnuPG to sign packages as the user
       <i>"John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;"</i> from the key rings located in
       <i>/etc/rpm/.gpg</i> using the executable <i>/opt/bin/gpg</i> you would include

              %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg
              %_gpg_name John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;
              %__gpg /opt/bin/gpg

       in a macro configuration file, typically ~/.config/rpm/macros.
       See <b>Macro Configuration </b>in <a href="rpm.8.html">rpm(8)</a> for more details.

       aliases it's impossible to guarantee that what's described in the
