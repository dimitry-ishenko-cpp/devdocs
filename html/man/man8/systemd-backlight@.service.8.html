NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-backlight@.service, systemd-backlight - Load and save the
       display backlight brightness at boot and shutdown
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-backlight@.service

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight save [backlight|leds]:DEVICE

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight load [backlight|leds]:DEVICE
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-backlight@.service is a service that restores the
       brightness of a display backlight or LED (e.g. keyboard
       backlight) device at early boot, and saves it at shutdown. The
       brightness is stored in /var/lib/systemd/backlight/.

       On restoring brightness of a display backlight device,
       <b>systemd-backlight </b>reads <i>ID_BACKLIGHT_CLAMP</i> udev property, that
       takes a boolean value or a percentage (needs to be suffixed with
       "%", e.g.  "30%"). When a percentage is specified, the saved
       brightness is clamped to a value of at least 1 or the specified
       percentage of the maximum brightness, whichever is greater. When
       unset or set to true, the brightness is clamped in the same way
       with percentage 5%. When false, the saved brightness will not be
       clamped, and loaded as is.

       On restoring brightness of a LED device, <b>systemd-backlight </b>reads
       <i>ID_LEDS_CLAMP</i> udev property, that also takes a boolean value or a
       percentage. When a percentage is specified, the saved brightness
       is clamped to the specified percentage of the maximum brightness.
       When set to true, the brightness is clamped in the same way with
       percentage 5%. When unset or set to false, the saved brightness
       will not be clamped, and loaded as is.
</pre> <h2>
KERNEL COMMAND LINE </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-backlight understands the following kernel command line
       parameter:

       <i>systemd.restore_state=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. Defaults to "1". If "0", does not
           restore the backlight settings on boot. However, settings
           will still be stored on shutdown.

           Added in version 209.
