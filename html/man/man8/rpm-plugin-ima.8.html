NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rpm-plugin-ima - IMA plugin for the RPM Package Manager
</pre> <h2>
Description </h2>
<pre>
       Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) and the Linux Extended
       Verification Module (EVM) allow to detect when files have been
       accidentally or maliciously altered.  This plugin puts IMA/EVM
       signatures in the <i>security.ima</i> extended file attribute during in‐
       stallation.  This requires packages to contain the signatures -
       typically by being signed with <b>rpmsign --signfiles</b>.
</pre> <h2>
Configuration </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>%_ima_sign_config_files</i> macro controls whether signatures
       should also be written for config files.

       See <a href="rpm-plugins.8.html">rpm-plugins(8)</a> on how to control plugins in general.
