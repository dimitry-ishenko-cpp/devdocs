NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pppdump - convert PPP record file to readable format
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pppdump </b>[ <b>-h </b>| <b>-p </b>[ <b>-d </b>]] [ <b>-r </b>] [ <b>-a </b>] [ <b>-m </b><i>mru</i> ] [ <i>file</i> ...  ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pppdump </b>utility converts the files written using the <i>record</i>
       option of <b>pppd </b>into a human-readable format.  If one or more
       filenames are specified, <b>pppdump </b>will read each in turn;
       otherwise it will read its standard input.  In each case the
       result is written to standard output.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-h     </b>Prints the bytes sent and received in hexadecimal.  If
              neither this option nor the <b>-p </b>option is specified, the
              bytes are printed as the characters themselves, with non-
              printing and non-ASCII characters printed as escape
              sequences.

       <b>-p     </b>Collects the bytes sent and received into PPP packets,
              interpreting the async HDLC framing and escape characters
              and checking the FCS (frame check sequence) of each
              packet.  The packets are printed as hex values and as
              characters (non-printable characters are printed as `.').

       <b>-d     </b>With the <b>-p </b>option, this option causes <b>pppdump </b>to
              decompress packets which have been compressed with the
              BSD-Compress or Deflate methods.

       <b>-r     </b>Reverses the direction indicators, so that `sent' is
              printed for bytes or packets received, and `rcvd' is
              printed for bytes or packets sent.

       <b>-a     </b>Prints absolute times.

       <b>-m </b><i>mru</i> Use <i>mru</i> as the MRU (maximum receive unit) for both
              directions of the link when checking for over-length PPP
              packets (with the <b>-p </b>option).
