DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dcb pfc </b>is used to configure Priority-based Flow Control
       attributes through Linux DCB (Data Center Bridging) interface.
       PFC permits marking flows with a certain priority as lossless,
       and holds related configuration, as well as PFC counters.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
       For read-write parameters, the following describes only the write
       direction, i.e. as used with the <b>set </b>command. For the <b>show</b>
       command, the parameter name is to be used as a simple keyword
       without further arguments. This instructs the tool to show the
       value of a given parameter. When no parameters are given, the
       tool shows the complete PFC configuration.

       <b>pfc-cap</b>
              A read-only property that shows the number of traffic
              classes that may simultaneously support PFC.

       <b>requests</b>
              A read-only count of the sent PFC frames per traffic
              class. Only shown when -s is given, or when requested
              explicitly.

       <b>indications</b>
              A read-only count of the received PFC frames per traffic
              class. Only shown when -s is given, or when requested
              explicitly.

       <b>macsec-bypass </b>{ <b>on </b>| <b>off </b>}
              Whether the sending station is capable of bypassing MACsec
              processing when MACsec is disabled.

       <b>prio-pfc </b><i>PFC-MAP</i>
              <i>PFC-MAP</i> uses the array parameter syntax, see <a href="dcb.8.html">dcb(8)</a> for
              details. Keys are priorities, values are on / off
              indicators of whether PFC is enabled for a given priority.

       <b>delay </b><i>INTEGER</i>
              The allowance made for round-trip propagation delay of the
              link in bits.  The value shall be 0..65535.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE &amp; USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Enable PFC on priorities 6 and 7, leaving the rest intact:

       # dcb pfc set dev eth0 prio-pfc 6:on 7:on

       Disable PFC of all priorities except 6 and 7, and configure delay
       to 4096 bits:

       # dcb pfc set dev eth0 prio-pfc all:off 6:on 7:on delay 0x1000

       Show what was set:

       # dcb pfc show dev eth0
       pfc-cap 8 macsec-bypass off delay 4096
       prio-pfc 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:on 7:on
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive integer
       upon failure.
