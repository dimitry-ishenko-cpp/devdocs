DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ip stats set</b>
              is used for toggling whether a certain HW statistics suite
              is collected on a given netdevice. The following
              statistics suites are supported:

              <b>l3_stats </b>L3 stats reflect traffic that takes place in a HW
                     device on an object that corresponds to the given
                     software netdevice.

       <b>ip stats show</b>
              is used for showing stats on a given netdevice, or dumping
              statistics across all netdevices. By default, all stats
              are requested. It is possible to filter which stats are
              requested by using the <b>group </b>and <b>subgroup </b>keywords.

              It is possible to specify several groups, or several
              subgroups for one group. When no subgroups are given for a
              group, all the subgroups are requested.

              The following groups are recognized:

              <b>group link </b>- Link statistics. The same suite that "ip -s
                     link show" shows.

              <b>group offload </b>- A group that contains a number of HW-
                     oriented statistics. See below for individual
                     subgroups within this group.

              <b>group xstats </b>- Extended statistics. A subgroup identifies
                     the type of netdevice to show the statistics for.

              <b>group xstats_slave </b>- Extended statistics for the slave of
                     a netdevice of a given type. A subgroup identifies
                     the type of master netdevice.

              <b>group afstats </b>- A group for address-family specific
                     netdevice statistics.

       <b>group offload </b>subgroups:

              <b>subgroup cpu_hit </b>- The <b>cpu_hit </b>statistics suite is useful
                     on hardware netdevices. The <b>link </b>statistics on
                     these devices reflect both the hardware- and
                     software-datapath traffic. The <b>cpu_hit </b>statistics
                     then only reflect software-datapath traffic.

              <b>subgroup hw_stats_info </b>- This suite does not include
                     traffic statistics, but rather communicates the
                     state of other statistics. Through this subgroup,
                     it is possible to discover whether a given
                     statistic was enabled, and when it was, whether any
                     device driver actually configured its device to
                     collect these statistics. For example, <b>l3_stats </b>was
                     enabled in the following case, but no driver has
                     installed it:

                     # ip stats show dev swp1 group offload subgroup
                     hw_stats_info
                     56: swp1: group offload subgroup hw_stats_info
                         l3_stats on used off

                     After an L3 address is added to the netdevice, the
                     counter will be installed:

                     # ip addr add dev swp1 192.0.2.1/28
                     # ip stats show dev swp1 group offload subgroup
                     hw_stats_info
                     56: swp1: group offload subgroup hw_stats_info
                         l3_stats on used on

              <b>subgroup l3_stats </b>- These statistics reflect L3 traffic
                     that takes place in HW on an object that
                     corresponds to the netdevice. Note that this suite
                     is disabled by default and needs to be first
                     enabled through <b>ip stats set</b>.

                     For example:

                     # ip stats show dev swp2.200 group offload subgroup
                     l3_stats
                     112: swp2.200: group offload subgroup l3_stats on
                     used on
                         RX:  bytes packets errors dropped   mcast
                               8900      72      2       0       3
                         TX:  bytes packets errors dropped
                               7176      58      0       0

                     Note how the l3_stats_info for the selected group
                     is also part of the dump.

       <b>group xstats </b>and <b>group xstats_slave </b>subgroups:

              <b>subgroup bridge </b>[ <b>suite stp </b>] [ <b>suite mcast </b>] - Statistics
                     for STP and, respectively, IGMP / MLD (under the
                     keyword <b>mcast</b>) traffic on bridges and their slaves.

              <b>subgroup bond </b>[ <b>suite 802.3ad </b>] - Statistics for LACP
                     traffic on bond devices and their slaves.

       <b>group afstats </b>subgroups:

              <b>subgroup mpls </b>- Statistics for MPLS traffic seen on the
                     netdevice. For example:

                     # ip stats show dev veth01 group afstats subgroup
                     mpls
                     3: veth01: group afstats subgroup mpls
                         RX: bytes packets errors dropped noroute
                                 0       0      0       0       0
                         TX: bytes packets errors dropped
