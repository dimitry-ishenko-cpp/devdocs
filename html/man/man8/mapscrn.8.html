NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mapscrn - load screen output mapping table
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mapscrn </b>[<b>-V</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-o </b><i>map.orig</i>] <i>mapfile</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>mapscrn </b>command is obsolete - its function is now built-in
       into setfont.  However, for backwards compatibility it is still
       available as a separate command.

       The <i>mapscrn</i> command loads a user defined output character mapping
       table into the console driver. The console driver may be later
       put into <b>use user-defined mapping table </b>mode by outputting a
       special escape sequence to the console device.  This sequence is
       <i>&lt;esc&gt;(K</i> for the <b>G0 </b>character set and <i>&lt;esc&gt;)K</i> for the <b>G1 </b>character
       set.  When the <i>-o</i> option is given, the old map is saved in
       <i>map.orig.</i>
</pre> <h2>
USE </h2>
<pre>
       There are two kinds of mapping tables: direct-to-font tables,
       that give a font position for each user byte value, and user-to-
       unicode tables that give a unicode value for each user byte. The
       corresponding glyph is now found using the unicode index of the
       font.  The command
              mapscrn trivial
       sets up a one-to-one direct-to-font table where user bytes
       directly address the font. This is useful for fonts that are in
       the same order as the character set one uses.  A command like
              mapscrn 8859-2
       sets up a user-to-unicode table that assumes that the user uses
       ISO 8859-2.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mapscrn</i> command can read the map in either of two formats:
       1. 256 or 512 bytes binary data
       2. two-column text file
       Format (1) is a direct image of the translation <i>table. The</i>
       <i>256-bytes tables are direct-to-font,</i> the 512-bytes tables are
       user-to-unicode tables.  Format (2) is used to fill the <i>table</i> as
       follows: cell with offset mentioned in the first column is filled
       with the value mentioned in the second column.  When values
       larger than 255 occur, or values are written using the U+xxxx
       notation, the table is assumed to be a user-to-unicode table,
       otherwise it is a direct-to-font table.

       Values in the file may be specified in one of several <b>formats:</b>
       <b>1. Decimal: </b>String of decimal digits not starting with '0'
       <b>2. Octal: </b>String of octal digits beginning with '0'.
       <b>3. Hexadecimal: </b>String of hexadecimal digits preceded by "0x".
       <b>4. Unicode: </b>String of four hexadecimal digits preceded by "U+".
       <b>5. Character: </b>Single character enclosed in single quotes. (And
       the binary value is used.)  Note that blank, comma, tab character
       and '#' cannot be specified with this format.
       <b>6. UTF-8 Character: </b>Single (possibly multi-byte) UTF-8 character,
       enclosed in single quotes.

       Note that control characters (with codes &lt; 32) cannot be re-
       mapped with <i>mapscrn</i> because they have special meaning for the
       driver.
</pre> <h2>
OTHER OPTIONS </h2>

       <b>-v     </b>Be verbose.
