</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       chpasswd - update passwords in batch mode
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>chpasswd </b>[<i>options</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>chpasswd </b>command reads a list of user name and password pairs
       from standard input and uses this information to update a group
       of existing users. Each line is of the format:

       <i>user_name</i>:<i>password</i>

       By default the passwords must be supplied in clear-text, and are
       encrypted by <b>chpasswd</b>. Also the password age will be updated, if
       present.

       By default, passwords are encrypted by PAM, but (even if not
       recommended) you can select a different encryption method with
       the <b>-e</b>, <b>-m</b>, or <b>-c </b>options.

       Except when PAM is used to encrypt the passwords, <b>chpasswd </b>first
       updates all the passwords in memory, and then commits all the
       changes to disk if no errors occurred for any user.

       When PAM is used to encrypt the passwords (and update the
       passwords in the system database) then if a password cannot be
       updated <b>chpasswd </b>continues updating the passwords of the next
       users, and will return an error code on exit.

       This command is intended to be used in a large system environment
       where many accounts are created at a single time.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The options which apply to the <b>chpasswd </b>command are:

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--crypt-method </b><i>METHOD</i>
           Use the specified method to encrypt the passwords.

           The available methods are <i>DES</i>, <i>MD5</i>, <i>SHA256</i>, <i>SHA512</i> and <i>NONE</i>
           if your libc supports these methods.

           By default, PAM is used to encrypt the passwords.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--encrypted</b>
           Supplied passwords are in encrypted form.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help message and exit.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--md5</b>
           Use MD5 encryption instead of DES when the supplied passwords
           are not encrypted.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root </b><i>CHROOT_DIR</i>
           Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use the
           configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only
           absolute paths are supported.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--prefix </b><i>PREFIX_DIR</i>
           Apply changes to configuration files under the root
           filesystem found under the directory <i>PREFIX_DIR</i>. This option
           does not chroot and is intended for preparing a
           cross-compilation target. Some limitations: NIS and LDAP
           users/groups are not verified. PAM authentication is using
           the host files. No SELINUX support.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sha-rounds </b><i>ROUNDS</i>
           Use the specified number of rounds to encrypt the passwords.

           You can only use this option with crypt method: <i>SHA256 SHA512</i>

           By default, the number of rounds for SHA256 or SHA512 is
           defined by the SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS and SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS
           variables in /etc/login.defs.

           A minimal value of 1000 and a maximal value of 999,999,999
           will be enforced for SHA256 and SHA512. The default number of
           rounds is 5000.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       Remember to set permissions or umask to prevent readability of
       unencrypted files by other users.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
       the behavior of this tool:

       <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS </b>(number), <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS </b>(number)
           When <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>is set to <i>SHA256</i> or <i>SHA512</i>, this defines
           the number of SHA rounds used by the encryption algorithm by
           default (when the number of rounds is not specified on the
           command line).

           With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute force the
           password. But note also that more CPU resources will be
           needed to authenticate users.

           If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of
           rounds (5000), which is orders of magnitude too low for
           modern hardware.

           The values must be inside the 1000-999,999,999 range.

           If only one of the <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS </b>or
           <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS </b>values is set, then this value will be
           used.

           If <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS </b>&gt; <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS</b>, the highest
           value will be used.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The
           generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to
           the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
           consistently with the PAM configuration.
