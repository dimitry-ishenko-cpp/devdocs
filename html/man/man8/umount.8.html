</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       umount - unmount filesystems
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>umount -a </b>[<b>-dflnrv</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>fstype</i>] [<b>-O </b><i>option</i>...]

       <b>umount </b>[<b>-dflnrv</b>] {<i>directory</i>|<i>device</i>}

       <b>umount -h</b>|<b>-V</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>umount </b>command detaches the mentioned filesystem(s) from the
       file hierarchy. A filesystem is specified by giving the directory
       where it has been mounted. Giving the special device on which the
       filesystem lives may also work, but is obsolete, mainly because
       it will fail in case this device was mounted on more than one
       directory.

       Note that a filesystem cannot be unmounted when it is 'busy' -
       for example, when there are open files on it, or when some
       process has its working directory there, or when a swap file on
       it is in use. The offending process could even be <b>umount </b>itself -
       it opens libc, and libc in its turn may open for example locale
       files. A lazy unmount avoids this problem, but it may introduce
       other issues. See <b>--lazy </b>description below.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
           All of the filesystems described in <i>/proc/self/mountinfo</i> (or
           in deprecated <i>/etc/mtab</i>) are unmounted, except the proc,
           devfs, devpts, sysfs, rpc_pipefs and nfsd filesystems. This
           list of the filesystems may be replaced by <b>--types </b>umount
           option.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all-targets</b>
           Unmount all mountpoints in the current mount namespace for
           the specified filesystem. The filesystem can be specified by
           one of the mountpoints or the device name (or UUID, etc.).
           When this option is used together with <b>--recursive</b>, then all
           nested mounts within the filesystem are recursively
           unmounted. This option is only supported on systems where
           <i>/etc/mtab</i> is a symlink to <i>/proc/mounts</i>.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--no-canonicalize</b>
           Do not canonicalize paths. The paths canonicalization is
           based on <a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink(2)</a> system calls. These system
           calls may hang in some cases (for example on NFS if server is
           not available). The option has to be used with canonical path
           to the mount point.

           This option is silently ignored by <b>umount </b>for non-root users.

           For more details about this option see the <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> man page.
           Note that <b>umount </b>does not pass this option to the
           <b>/sbin/umount.</b><i>type</i> helpers.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--detach-loop</b>
           When the unmounted device was a loop device, also free this
           loop device. This option is unnecessary for devices
           initialized by <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>, in this case "autoclear"
           functionality is enabled by default.

       <b>--fake</b>
           Causes everything to be done except for the actual system
           call or umount helper execution; this 'fakes' unmounting the
           filesystem. It can be used to remove entries from the
           deprecated <i>/etc/mtab</i> that were unmounted earlier with the <b>-n</b>
           option.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
           Force an unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS system).

           Note that this option does not guarantee that umount command
           does not hang. It’s strongly recommended to use absolute
           paths without symlinks to avoid unwanted <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink(2)</a> and
           <a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> system calls on unreachable NFS in <b>umount</b>.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--internal-only</b>
           Do not call the <b>/sbin/umount.</b><i>filesystem</i> helper even if it
           exists. By default such a helper program is called if it
           exists.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--lazy</b>
           Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the file hierarchy
           now, and clean up all references to this filesystem as soon
           as it is not busy anymore.

           A system reboot would be expected in near future if you’re
           going to use this option for network filesystem or local
           filesystem with submounts. The recommended use-case for
           <b>umount -l </b>is to prevent hangs on shutdown due to an
           unreachable network share where a normal <b>umount </b>will hang due
           to a downed server or a network partition. Remounts of the
           share will not be possible.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--namespace </b><i>ns</i>
           Perform <b>umount </b>in the mount namespace specified by <i>ns</i>. <i>ns</i> is
           either PID of process running in that namespace or special
           file representing that namespace.

           <b>umount </b>switches to the namespace when it reads <i>/etc/fstab</i>,
           writes <i>/etc/mtab</i> (or writes to <i>/run/mount</i>) and calls
           <a href="../man2/umount.2.html">umount(2)</a> system call, otherwise it runs in the original
           namespace. It means that the target mount namespace does not
           have to contain any libraries or other requirements necessary
           to execute <a href="../man2/umount.2.html">umount(2)</a> command.

           See <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a> for more information.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-mtab</b>
           Unmount without writing in <i>/etc/mtab</i>.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--test-opts </b><i>option</i>...
           Unmount only the filesystems that have the specified option
           set in <i>/etc/fstab</i>. More than one option may be specified in a
           comma-separated list. Each option can be prefixed with <b>no </b>to
           indicate that no action should be taken for this option.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppress "not mounted" error messages.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
           Recursively unmount each specified directory. Recursion for
           each directory will stop if any unmount operation in the
           chain fails for any reason. The relationship between
           mountpoints is determined by <i>/proc/self/mountinfo</i> entries.
           The filesystem must be specified by mountpoint path; a
           recursive unmount by device name (or UUID) is unsupported.
           Since version 2.37 it umounts also all over-mounted
           filesystems (more filesystems on the same mountpoint).

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--read-only</b>
           When an unmount fails, try to remount the filesystem
           read-only.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--types </b><i>type</i>...
           Indicate that the actions should only be taken on filesystems
           of the specified <i>type</i>. More than one type may be specified in
           a comma-separated list. The list of filesystem types can be
           prefixed with <b>no </b>to indicate that no action should be taken
           for all of the mentioned types. Note that <b>umount </b>reads
           information about mounted filesystems from kernel
           (<i>/proc/mounts</i>) and filesystem names may be different than
           filesystem names used in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> (e.g., "nfs4" vs.
           "nfs").

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Verbose mode.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
NON-SUPERUSER UMOUNTS </h2>
<pre>
       Normally, only the superuser can umount filesystems. However,
       when <i>fstab</i> contains the <b>user </b>option on a line, anybody can umount
       the corresponding filesystem. For more details see <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> man
       page.

       Since version 2.34 the <b>umount </b>command can be used to perform
       umount operation also for fuse filesystems if kernel mount table
       contains user’s ID. In this case <i>fstab</i> <b>user= </b>mount option is not
       required.

       Since version 2.35 <b>umount </b>command does not exit when user
       permissions are inadequate by internal <b>libmount </b>security rules.
       It drops suid permissions and continue as regular non-root user.
       This can be used to support use-cases where root permissions are
       not necessary (e.g., fuse filesystems, user namespaces, etc).
</pre> <h2>
LOOP DEVICE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>umount </b>command will automatically detach loop device
       previously initialized by <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> command independently of
       <i>/etc/mtab</i>.

       In this case the device is initialized with "autoclear" flag (see
       <a href="losetup.8.html">losetup(8)</a> output for more details), otherwise it’s necessary to
       use the option <b>--detach-loop </b>or call <b>losetup -d </b><i>device</i>. The
       autoclear feature is supported since Linux 2.6.25.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>umount </b>has the following exit status values (the bits can be
       ORed):

       <b>0</b>
           success

       <b>1</b>
           incorrect invocation or permissions

       <b>2</b>
           system error (out of memory, cannot fork, no more loop
           devices)

       <b>4</b>
           internal <b>mount </b>bug

       <b>8</b>
           user interrupt

       <b>16</b>
           problems writing or locking <i>/etc/mtab</i>

       <b>32</b>
           mount failure

       <b>64</b>
           some umount succeeded

           The command <b>umount -a </b>returns 0 (all succeeded), 32 (all
           failed), or 64 (some failed, some succeeded).

       <b>126</b>
           failed to execute external /sbin/umount.&lt;type&gt; mount helper
           (since util-linux v2.41)
</pre> <h2>
EXTERNAL HELPERS </h2>
<pre>
       The syntax of external unmount helpers is:

          <b>umount.</b><i>suffix</i> {<i>directory</i>|<i>device</i>} [<b>-flnrv</b>] [<b>-N </b><i>namespace</i>]
          [<b>-t </b><i>type</i>.<i>subtype</i>]

       where <i>suffix</i> is the filesystem type (or the value from a <b>uhelper=</b>
       or <b>helper= </b>marker in the mtab file). The <b>-t </b>option can be used
       for filesystems that have subtype support. For example:

          <b>umount.fuse -t fuse.sshfs</b>

       A <b>uhelper=</b><i>something</i> marker (unprivileged helper) can appear in
       the <i>/etc/mtab</i> file when ordinary users need to be able to unmount
       a mountpoint that is not defined in <i>/etc/fstab</i> (for example for a
       device that was mounted by <b>udisks</b>(1)).

       A <b>helper=</b><i>type</i> marker in the <i>mtab</i> file will redirect all unmount
       requests to the <b>/sbin/umount.</b><i>type</i> helper independently of UID.

       Note that <i>/etc/mtab</i> is currently deprecated and <b>helper= </b>and other
       userspace mount options are maintained by <b>libmount</b>.

       The exit status value of the helper is returned as the exit
       status of <a href="umount.8.html">umount(8)</a>. The value 126 is used if the mount helper
       program is found, but the execl() failed.
