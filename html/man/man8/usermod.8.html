</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       usermod - modify a user account
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>usermod </b>[<i>options</i>] <i>LOGIN</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>usermod </b>command modifies the system account files.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The options which apply to the <b>usermod </b>command are:

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--append</b>
           Add the user to the supplementary group(s). Use only with the
           <b>-G </b>option.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--badname</b>
           Allow names that do not conform to standards.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--comment </b><i>COMMENT</i>
           update the comment field of the user in /etc/passwd, which is
           normally modified using the <a href="../man1/chfn.1.html">chfn(1)</a> utility.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--home </b><i>HOME_DIR</i>
           The user's new login directory.

           If the <b>-m </b>option is given, the contents of the current home
           directory will be moved to the new home directory, which is
           created if it does not already exist. If the current home
           directory does not exist the new home directory will not be
           created.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--expiredate </b><i>EXPIRE_DATE</i>
           The date on which the user account will be disabled. The date
           is specified in the format <i>YYYY-MM-DD</i>. Integers as input are
           interpreted as days after 1970-01-01.

           An input of -1 or an empty string will blank the account
           expiration field in the shadow password file. The account
           will remain available with no date limit.

           This option requires a /etc/shadow file. A /etc/shadow entry
           will be created if there were none.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--inactive </b><i>INACTIVE</i>
           defines the number of days after the password exceeded its
           maximum age during which the user may still login by
           immediately replacing the password. This grace period before
           the account becomes inactive is stored in the shadow password
           file. An input of 0 will disable an expired password with no
           delay. An input of -1 will blank the respective field in the
           shadow password file. See <a href="../man5/shadow.5.html">shadow(5)</a> for more information.

           This option requires a /etc/shadow file. A /etc/shadow entry
           will be created if there were none.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gid </b><i>GROUP</i>
           The name or numerical ID of the user's new primary group. The
           group must exist.

           Any file from the user's home directory owned by the previous
           primary group of the user will be owned by this new group.

           The group ownership of files outside of the user's home
           directory must be fixed manually.

           The change of the group ownership of files inside of the
           user's home directory is also not done if the home dir owner
           uid is different from the current or new user id. This is a
           safety measure for special home directories such as /.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--groups </b><i>GROUP1</i>[<i>,GROUP2,...</i>[<i>,GROUPN</i>]]]
           A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a
           member of. Each group is separated from the next by a comma,
           with no intervening whitespace. The groups must exist.

           If the user is currently a member of a group which is not
           listed, the user will be removed from the group. This
           behaviour can be changed via the <b>-a </b>option, which appends the
           user to the current supplementary group list.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--login </b><i>NEW_LOGIN</i>
           The name of the user will be changed from <i>LOGIN</i> to <i>NEW_LOGIN</i>.
           Nothing else is changed. In particular, the user's home
           directory or mail spool should probably be renamed manually
           to reflect the new login name.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--lock</b>
           Lock a user's password. This puts a '!' in front of the
           encrypted password, effectively disabling the password. You
           can't use this option with <b>-p </b>or <b>-U</b>.

           Note: if you wish to lock the account (not only access with a
           password), you should also set the <i>EXPIRE_DATE</i> to <i>1</i>.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--move-home</b>
           moves the content of the user's home directory to the new
           location. If the current home directory does not exist the
           new home directory will not be created.

           This option is only valid in combination with the <b>-d </b>(or
           <b>--home</b>) option.

           <b>usermod </b>will try to adapt the ownership of the files and to
           copy the modes, ACL and extended attributes, but manual
           changes might be needed afterwards.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--non-unique</b>
           allows to change the user ID to a non-unique value.

           This option is only valid in combination with the <b>-u </b>option.
           As a user identity serves as key to map between users on one
           hand and permissions, file ownerships and other aspects that
           determine the system's behavior on the other hand, more than
           one login name will access the account of the given UID.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--password </b><i>PASSWORD</i>
           defines a new password for the user. PASSWORD is expected to
           be encrypted, as returned by <b>crypt </b>(3).

           <b>Note: </b>Avoid this option on the command line because the
           password (or encrypted password) will be visible by users
           listing the processes.

           The password will be written in the local /etc/passwd or
           /etc/shadow file. This might differ from the password
           database configured in your PAM configuration.

           You should make sure the password respects the system's
           password policy.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--remove</b>
           Remove the user from named supplementary group(s). Use only
           with the <b>-G </b>option.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root </b><i>CHROOT_DIR</i>
           Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use the
           configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only
           absolute paths are supported.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--prefix </b><i>PREFIX_DIR</i>
           Apply changes within the directory tree starting with
           <i>PREFIX_DIR</i> and use as well the configuration files located
           there. This option does not chroot and is intended for
           preparing a cross-compilation target. Some limitations: NIS
           and LDAP users/groups are not verified. PAM authentication is
           using the host files. No SELINUX support.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--shell </b><i>SHELL</i>
           changes the user's login shell. An empty string for SHELL
           blanks the field in /etc/passwd and logs the user into the
           system's default shell.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--uid </b><i>UID</i>
           The new value of the user's ID.

           This value must be unique, unless the <b>-o </b>option is used. The
           value must be non-negative.

           The user's mailbox, and any files which the user owns and
           which are located in the user's home directory will have the
           file user ID changed automatically.

           The ownership of files outside of the user's home directory
           must be fixed manually.

           The change of the user ownership of files inside of the
           user's home directory is also not done if the home dir owner
           uid is different from the current or new user id. This is a
           safety measure for special home directories such as /.

           No checks will be performed with regard to the <b>UID_MIN</b>,
           <b>UID_MAX</b>, <b>SYS_UID_MIN</b>, or <b>SYS_UID_MAX </b>from /etc/login.defs.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--unlock</b>
           Unlock a user's password. This removes the '!' in front of
           the encrypted password. You can't use this option with <b>-p </b>or
           <b>-L</b>.

           Note: if you wish to unlock the account (not only access with
           a password), you should also set the <i>EXPIRE_DATE</i> (for example
           to <i>99999</i>, or to the <b>EXPIRE </b>value from /etc/default/useradd).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--add-subuids </b><i>FIRST</i>-<i>LAST</i>
           Add a range of subordinate uids to the user's account.

           This option may be specified multiple times to add multiple
           ranges to a user's account.

           No checks will be performed with regard to <b>SUB_UID_MIN</b>,
           <b>SUB_UID_MAX</b>, or <b>SUB_UID_COUNT </b>from /etc/login.defs.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--del-subuids </b><i>FIRST</i>-<i>LAST</i>
           Remove a range of subordinate uids from the user's account.

           This option may be specified multiple times to remove
           multiple ranges to a user's account. When both <b>--del-subuids</b>
           and <b>--add-subuids </b>are specified, the removal of all
           subordinate uid ranges happens before any subordinate uid
           range is added.

           No checks will be performed with regard to <b>SUB_UID_MIN</b>,
           <b>SUB_UID_MAX</b>, or <b>SUB_UID_COUNT </b>from /etc/login.defs.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--add-subgids </b><i>FIRST</i>-<i>LAST</i>
           Add a range of subordinate gids to the user's account.

           This option may be specified multiple times to add multiple
           ranges to a user's account.

           No checks will be performed with regard to <b>SUB_GID_MIN</b>,
           <b>SUB_GID_MAX</b>, or <b>SUB_GID_COUNT </b>from /etc/login.defs.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--del-subgids </b><i>FIRST</i>-<i>LAST</i>
           Remove a range of subordinate gids from the user's account.

           This option may be specified multiple times to remove
           multiple ranges to a user's account. When both <b>--del-subgids</b>
           and <b>--add-subgids </b>are specified, the removal of all
           subordinate gid ranges happens before any subordinate gid
           range is added.

           No checks will be performed with regard to <b>SUB_GID_MIN</b>,
           <b>SUB_GID_MAX</b>, or <b>SUB_GID_COUNT </b>from /etc/login.defs.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--selinux-user </b><i>SEUSER</i>
           defines the SELinux user to be mapped with <i>LOGIN</i>. An empty
           string ("") will remove the respective entry (if any). Note
           that the shadow system doesn't store the selinux-user, it
           uses semanage(8) for that.

       <b>--selinux-range </b><i>SERANGE</i>
           defines the SELinux MLS range for the new account. Note that
           the shadow system doesn't store the selinux-range, it uses
           <a href="semanage.8.html">semanage(8)</a> for that.

           This option is only valid if the <b>-Z </b>(or <b>--selinux-user</b>)
           option is specified.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       You must make certain that the named user is not executing any
       processes when this command is being executed if the user's
       numerical user ID, the user's name, or the user's home directory
       is being changed.  <b>usermod </b>checks this on Linux. On other
       operating systems it only uses utmp to check if the user is
       logged in.

       You must change the owner of any <b>crontab </b>files or <b>at </b>jobs
       manually.

       You must make any changes involving NIS on the NIS server.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
       the behavior of this tool:

       <b>LASTLOG_UID_MAX </b>(number)
           Highest user ID number for which the lastlog entries should
           be updated. As higher user IDs are usually tracked by remote
           user identity and authentication services there is no need to
           create a huge sparse lastlog file for them.

           No <b>LASTLOG_UID_MAX </b>option present in the configuration means
           that there is no user ID limit for writing lastlog entries.

       <b>MAIL_DIR </b>(string)
           The mail spool directory. This is needed to manipulate the
           mailbox when its corresponding user account is modified or
           deleted. If not specified, a compile-time default is used.
           The parameter CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL in /etc/default/useradd
           determines whether the mail spool should be created.

       <b>MAIL_FILE </b>(string)
           Defines the location of the users mail spool files relatively
           to their home directory.

       The <b>MAIL_DIR </b>and <b>MAIL_FILE </b>variables are used by <b>useradd</b>,
       <b>usermod</b>, and <b>userdel </b>to create, move, or delete the user's mail
       spool.

       <b>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP </b>(number)
           Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached,
           a new group entry (line) is started in /etc/group (with the
           same name, same password, and same GID).

           The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in
           the number of members in a group.

           This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of
           lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
           lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters.

           If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

           Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in
           the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable
           unless you really need it.

       <b>SUB_GID_MIN </b>(number), <b>SUB_GID_MAX </b>(number), <b>SUB_GID_COUNT</b>
       (number)
           If /etc/subuid exists, the commands <b>useradd </b>and <b>newusers</b>
           (unless the user already have subordinate group IDs) allocate
           <b>SUB_GID_COUNT </b>unused group IDs from the range <b>SUB_GID_MIN </b>to
           <b>SUB_GID_MAX </b>for each new user.

           The default values for <b>SUB_GID_MIN</b>, <b>SUB_GID_MAX</b>,
           <b>SUB_GID_COUNT </b>are respectively 100000, 600100000 and 65536.

       <b>SUB_UID_MIN </b>(number), <b>SUB_UID_MAX </b>(number), <b>SUB_UID_COUNT</b>
       (number)
           If /etc/subuid exists, the commands <b>useradd </b>and <b>newusers</b>
           (unless the user already have subordinate user IDs) allocate
           <b>SUB_UID_COUNT </b>unused user IDs from the range <b>SUB_UID_MIN </b>to
           <b>SUB_UID_MAX </b>for each new user.

           The default values for <b>SUB_UID_MIN</b>, <b>SUB_UID_MAX</b>,
           <b>SUB_UID_COUNT </b>are respectively 100000, 600100000 and 65536.
