DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The  dmstats  program  manages  IO statistics regions for devices
       that use the device-mapper driver. Statistics regions may be cre‐
       ated, deleted, listed and reported on using the tool.

       The first argument to dmstats is a <i>command</i>.

       The second argument is the <i>device name</i>, <i>uuid</i> or <i>major</i>  and  <i>minor</i>
       numbers.

       Further  options  permit  the selection of regions, output format
       control, and reporting behaviour.

       When no device argument is given dmstats will by default  operate
       on  all device-mapper devices present. The <b>create </b>and <b>delete </b>com‐
       mands require the use of <b>--alldevices </b>when used in this way.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--alias </b><i>name</i>
              Specify an alias name for a group.

       <b>--alldevices</b>
              If no device arguments are given allow operation on all
              devices when creating or deleting regions.

       <b>--allprograms</b>
              Include regions from all program IDs for list and report
              operations.

       <b>--allregions</b>
              Include all present regions for commands that normally ac‐
              cept a single region identifier.

       <b>--area </b>When peforming a list or report, include objects of type
              area in the results.

       <b>--areas </b><i>nr_areas</i>
              Specify the number of statistics areas to create within a
              new region.

       <b>--areasize </b><i>area_size</i>[
              <b>b</b>|<b>B</b>|<b>s</b>|<b>S</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>K</b>|<b>m</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>g</b>|<b>G</b>|<b>t</b>|<b>T</b>|<b>p</b>|<b>P</b>|<b>e</b>|<b>E</b>] Specify the size of areas
              into which a new region should be divided. An optional
              suffix selects units of: (<b>b</b>)ytes, (<b>s</b>)ectors, (<b>k</b>)ilobytes,
              (<b>m</b>)egabytes, (<b>g</b>)igabytes, (<b>t</b>)erabytes, (<b>p</b>)etabytes,
              (<b>e</b>)xabytes.  Capitalise to use multiples of 1000 (S.I.)
              instead of 1024.

       <b>--clear</b>
              When printing statistics counters, also atomically reset
              them to zero.

       <b>--count </b><i>count</i>
              Specify the iteration count for repeating reports. If the
              count argument is zero reports will continue to repeat un‐
              til interrupted.

       <b>--group</b>
              When peforming a list or report, include objects of type
              group in the results.

       <b>--filemap</b>
              Instead of creating regions on a device as specified by
              command line options, open the file found at each
              <b>file_path </b>argument, and create regions corresponding to
              the locations of the on-disk extents allocated to the
              file(s).

       <b>--nomonitor</b>
              Disable the <b>dmfilemapd </b>daemon when creating new file
              mapped groups. Normally the device-mapper filemap monitor‐
              ing daemon, <b>dmfilemapd</b>, is started for each file mapped
              group to update the set of regions as the file changes on-
              disk: use of this option disables this behaviour.

              Regions in the group may still be updated with the <b>up‐</b>
              <b>date_filemap </b>command, or by starting the daemon manually.

       <b>--follow </b><i>follow_mode</i>
              Specify the <b>dmfilemapd </b>file following mode. The file map
              monitoring daemon can monitor files in two distinct ways:
              the mode affects the behaviour of the daemon when a file
              under monitoring is renamed or unlinked, and the condi‐
              tions which cause the daemon to terminate.

              The <b>follow_mode </b>argument is either "inode", for follow-in‐
              ode mode, or "path", for follow-path.

              If follow-inode mode is used, the daemon will hold the
              file open, and continue to update regions from the same
              file descriptor. This means that the mapping will follow
              rename, move (within the same file system), and unlink op‐
              erations. This mode is useful if the file is expected to
              be moved, renamed, or unlinked while it is being moni‐
              tored.

              In follow-inode mode, the daemon will exit once it detects
              that the file has been unlinked and it is the last holder
              of a reference to it.

              If follow-path is used, the daemon will re-open the pro‐
              vided path on each monitoring iteration. This means that
              the group will be updated to reflect a new file being
              moved to the same path as the original file. This mode is
              useful for files that are expected to be updated via un‐
              link and rename.

              In follow-path mode, the daemon will exit if the file is
              removed and not replaced within a brief tolerance inter‐
              val.

              In either mode, the daemon exits automatically if the mon‐
              itored group is removed.

       <b>--foreground</b>
              Specify that the <b>dmfilemapd </b>daemon should run in the fore‐
              ground.  The daemon will not fork into the background, and
              will replace the <b>dmstats </b>command that started it.

       <b>--groupid </b><i>id</i>
              Specify the group to operate on.

       <b>--bounds </b><i>histogram_boundaries</i>
              [<b>ns</b>|<b>us</b>|<b>ms</b>|<b>s</b>] Specify the boundaries of a latency histogram
              to be tracked for the region as a comma separated list of
              latency values. Latency values are given in nanoseconds.
              An optional unit suffix of <b>ns</b>,<b>us</b>,<b>ms</b>, or <b>s </b>may be given af‐
              ter each value to specify units of nanoseconds, microsec‐
              onds, miliseconds or seconds respectively.

       <b>--histogram</b>
              When used with the <b>report </b>and <b>list </b>commands select default
              fields that emphasize latency histogram data.

       <b>--interval </b><i>seconds</i>
              Specify the interval in seconds between successive itera‐
              tions for repeating reports. If <b>--interval </b>is specified
              but <b>--count </b>is not, reports will continue to repeat until
              interrupted.

       <b>--length </b><i>length</i>[
              <b>b</b>|<b>B</b>|<b>s</b>|<b>S</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>K</b>|<b>m</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>g</b>|<b>G</b>|<b>t</b>|<b>T</b>|<b>p</b>|<b>P</b>|<b>e</b>|<b>E</b>] Specify the length of a
              new statistics region in sectors. An optional suffix se‐
              lects units of: (<b>b</b>)ytes, (<b>s</b>)ectors, (<b>k</b>)ilobytes,
              (<b>m</b>)egabytes, (<b>g</b>)igabytes, (<b>t</b>)erabytes, (<b>p</b>)etabytes,
              (<b>e</b>)xabytes.  Capitalise to use multiples of 1000 (S.I.)
              instead of 1024.

       <b>-j</b>|<b>--major </b><i>major</i>
              Specify the major number.

       <b>-m</b>|<b>--minor </b><i>minor</i>
              Specify the minor number.

       <b>--nogroup</b>
              When creating regions mapping the extents of a file in the
              file system, do not create a group or set an alias.

       <b>--nosuffix</b>
              Suppress the suffix on output sizes.  Use with <b>--units</b>
              (except h and H) if processing the output.

       <b>--notimesuffix</b>
              Suppress the suffix on output time values. Histogram
              boundary values will be reported in units of nanoseconds.

       <b>-o</b>|<b>--options</b>
              Specify which report fields to display.

       <b>-O</b>|<b>--sort </b><i>sort_fields</i>
              Sort output according to the list of fields given. Precede
              any sort field with '<b>-</b>' for a reverse sort on that column.

       <b>--precise</b>
              Attempt to use nanosecond precision counters when creating
              new statistics regions.

       <b>--programid </b><i>id</i>
              Specify a program ID string. When creating new statistics
              regions this string is stored with the region. Subsequent
              operations may supply a program ID in order to select only
              regions with a matching value. The default program ID for
              dmstats-managed regions is "dmstats".

       <b>--region</b>
              When peforming a list or report, include objects of type
              region in the results.

       <b>--regionid </b><i>id</i>
              Specify the region to operate on.

       <b>--regions </b><i>region_list</i>
              Specify a list of regions to group. The group list is a
              comma-separated list of region identifiers. Continuous se‐
              quences of identifiers may be expressed as a hyphen sepa‐
              rated range, for example: '1-10'.

       <b>--relative</b>
              If displaying the histogram report show relative (percent‐
              age) values instead of absolute counts.

       <b>-S</b>|<b>--select </b><i>selection</i>
              Display only rows that match <i>selection</i> criteria. All rows
              with the additional "selected" column (<b>-o selected</b>) show‐
              ing 1 if the row matches the <i>selection</i> and 0 otherwise.
              The selection criteria are defined by specifying column
              names and their valid values while making use of supported
              comparison operators.

       <b>--start </b><i>start</i>[
              <b>b</b>|<b>B</b>|<b>s</b>|<b>S</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>K</b>|<b>m</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>g</b>|<b>G</b>|<b>t</b>|<b>T</b>|<b>p</b>|<b>P</b>|<b>e</b>|<b>E</b>] Specify the start offset
              of a new statistics region in sectors. An optional suffix
              selects units of: (<b>b</b>)ytes, (<b>s</b>)ectors, (<b>k</b>)ilobytes,
              (<b>m</b>)egabytes, (<b>g</b>)igabytes, (<b>t</b>)erabytes, (<b>p</b>)etabytes,
              (<b>e</b>)xabytes.  Capitalise to use multiples of 1000 (S.I.)
              instead of 1024.

       <b>--segments</b>
              When used with <b>create</b>, create a new statistics region for
              each target contained in the given device(s). This causes
              a separate region to be allocated for each segment of the
              device.

              The newly created regions are automatically placed into a
              group unless the <b>--nogroup </b>option is given. When grouping
              is enabled a group alias may be specified using the
              <b>--alias </b>option.

       <b>--units</b>
              [<i>units</i>][<b>h</b>|<b>H</b>|<b>b</b>|<b>B</b>|<b>s</b>|<b>S</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>K</b>|<b>m</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>g</b>|<b>G</b>|<b>t</b>|<b>T</b>|<b>p</b>|<b>P</b>|<b>e</b>|<b>E</b>] Set the dis‐
              play units for report output.  All sizes are output in
              these units: (<b>h</b>)uman-readable, (<b>b</b>)ytes, (<b>s</b>)ectors,
              (<b>k</b>)ilobytes, (<b>m</b>)egabytes, (<b>g</b>)igabytes, (<b>t</b>)erabytes,
              (<b>p</b>)etabytes, (<b>e</b>)xabytes.  Capitalise to use multiples of
              1000 (S.I.) instead of 1024.  Can also specify custom
              units e.g. <b>--units 3M</b>.

       <b>--userdata </b><i>user_data</i>
              Specify user data (a word) to be stored with a new region.
              The value is added to any internal auxiliary data (for ex‐
              ample, group information), and stored with the region in
              the aux_data field provided by the kernel. Whitespace is
              not permitted.

       <b>-u</b>|<b>--uuid</b>
              Specify the uuid.

       <b>-v</b>|<b>--verbose </b>[<b>-v</b>|<b>--verbose</b>]
              Produce additional output.

COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>clear </b><i>device_name</i> [<b>--allprograms</b>|<b>--programid </b><i>id</i>]
              [<b>--allregions</b>|<b>--regionid </b><i>id</i>]
              Instructs the kernel to clear statistics counters for  the
              speficied  regions  (with  the  exception  of in-flight IO
              counters).

       <b>create </b><i>device_name</i>...|<i>file_path</i>...|<b>--alldevices </b>[<b>--areas</b>
              <i>nr_areas</i>|<b>--areasize </b><i>area_size</i>] [<b>--bounds</b>
              <i>histogram_boundaries</i>] [<b>--filemap</b>] [<b>--follow </b><i>follow_mode</i>]
              [<b>--foreground</b>] [<b>--nomonitor</b>] [<b>--nogroup</b>] [<b>--precise</b>]
              [<b>--start </b><i>start_sector</i> <b>--length </b><i>length</i>|<b>--segments</b>]
              [<b>--userdata </b><i>user_data</i>] [<b>--programid </b><i>id</i>]
              Creates one or more new statistics regions on  the  speci‐
              fied device(s).

              The  region will span the entire device unless <b>--start </b>and
              <b>--length </b>or <b>--segments </b>are given. The <b>--start </b>an  <b>--length</b>
              options allow a region of arbitrary length to be placed at
              an arbitrary offset into the device. The <b>--segments </b>option
              causes  a  new region to be created for each target in the
              corresponding device-mapper device's table.

              If the <b>--precise </b>option is used the command  will  attempt
              to create a region using nanosecond precision counters.

              If  <b>--bounds  </b>is given a latency histogram will be tracked
              for the new region. The boundaries of the  histogram  bins
              are  given  as  a  comma separated list of latency values.
              There is an implicit lower bound of zero on the first  bin
              and an implicit upper bound of infinity (or the configured
              interval duration) on the final bin.

              Latencies  are given in nanoseconds. An optional unit suf‐
              fix of ns, us, ms, or s may be given after each  value  to
              specify units of nanoseconds, microseconds, miliseconds or
              seconds  respectively,  so for example, 10ms is equivalent
              to 10000000. Latency values with a precision of less  than
              one  milisecond  can  only be used when precise timestamps
              are enabled: if <b>--precise </b>is not  given  and  values  less
              than  one milisecond are used it will be enabled automati‐
              cally.

              An optional <b>program_id </b>or <b>user_data </b>string may be  associ‐
              ated with the region. A <b>program_id </b>may then be used to se‐
              lect regions for subsequent list, print, and report opera‐
              tions. The <b>user_data </b>stores an arbitrary string and is not
              used  by  dmstats  or  the device-mapper kernel statistics
              subsystem.

              By default dmstats creates regions with  a  <b>program_id  </b>of
              "dmstats".

              On  success  the  <b>region_id </b>of the newly created region is
              printed to stdout.

              If the <b>--filemap </b>option is given with a regular  file,  or
              list  of files, as the <b>file_path </b>argument, instead of cre‐
              ating regions with parameters  specified  on  the  command
              line, <b>dmstats </b>will open the files located at <b>file_path </b>and
              create regions corresponding to the physical extents allo‐
              cated  to the file. This can be used to monitor statistics
              for individual files in the file system, for example, vir‐
              tual machine images, swap areas, or large database files.

              To work with the <b>--filemap </b>option, files must  be  located
              on  a local file system, backed by a device-mapper device,
              that supports physical extent data using the FIEMAP  ioctl
              (Ext4 and XFS for e.g.).

              By default regions that map a file are placed into a group
              and  the  group  alias is set to the basename of the file.
              This behaviour can be  overridden  with  the  <b>--alias  </b>and
              <b>--nogroup </b>options.

              Creating  a  group that maps a file automatically starts a
              daemon, <b>dmfilemapd </b>to monitor the file and update the map‐
              ping as the extents allocated to the file change. This be‐
              haviour can be disabled using the <b>--nomonitor </b>option.

              Use the <b>--group </b>option to  only  display  information  for
              groups when listing and reporting.

       <b>delete </b><i>device_name</i>|<b>--alldevices </b>[<b>--allprograms</b>|<b>--programid </b><i>id</i>]
              [<b>--allregions</b>|<b>--regionid </b><i>id</i>]
              Delete  the  specified statistics region. All counters and
              resources used by the region are released and  the  region
              will  not  appear in the output of subsequent list, print,
              or report operations.

              All regions registered on a device may  be  removed  using
              <b>--allregions</b>.

              To remove all regions on all devices both <b>--allregions </b>and
              <b>--alldevices </b>must be used.

              If  a  <b>--groupid </b>is given instead of a <b>--regionid </b>the com‐
              mand will attempt to delete the group and all regions that
              it contains.

              If a deleted region is the first member of a group of  re‐
              gions the group will also be removed.

       <b>group </b>[<i>device_name</i>|<b>--alldevices</b>] [<b>--alias </b><i>name</i>] [<b>--regions</b>
              <i>regions</i>]
              Combine  one  or  more statistics regions on the specified
              device into a group.

              The list of regions to be grouped is specified with  <b>--re‐</b>
              <b>gions  </b>and an optional alias may be assigned with <b>--alias</b>.
              The set of regions is given as a comma-separated  list  of
              region identifiers. A continuous range of identifers span‐
              ning from <b>R1 </b>to <b>R2 </b>may be expressed as '<b>R1</b>-<b>R2</b>'.

              Regions  that  have a histogram configured can be grouped:
              in this case the number of histogram bins and their bounds
              must match exactly.

              On success the group list and newly created  <b>group_id  </b>are
              printed to stdout.

              The  group  metadata is stored with the first (lowest num‐
              bered) <b>region_id </b>in the group: deleting this  region  will
              also  delete the group and other group members will be re‐
              turned to their prior state.

       <b>help </b>[<b>-c</b>|<b>-C</b>|<b>--columns</b>]
              Outputs a summary of the  commands  available,  optionally
              including the list of report fields.

       <b>list </b>[<i>device_name</i>] [<b>--histogram</b>] [<b>--allprograms</b>|<b>--programid </b><i>id</i>]
              [<b>--units </b><i>units</i>] [<b>--area</b>] [<b>--region</b>] [<b>--group</b>] [<b>--nosuffix</b>]
              [<b>--notimesuffix</b>] [<b>-v</b>|<b>--verbose</b>]
              List  the  statistics regions, areas, or groups registered
              on the device.  If the <b>--allprograms </b>switch is  given  all
              regions  will  be  listed  regardless of region program ID
              values.

              By default only regions and groups are  included  in  list
              output.  If  <b>-v </b>or <b>--verbose </b>is given the report will also
              include a row of information for each configured group and
              for each area contained in each region displayed.

              Regions that contain a single area are by default  omitted
              from the verbose list since their properties are identical
              to  the  area  that they contain - to view all regions re‐
              gardless of the number of areas present use <b>--region</b>).  To
              also view the areas contained within regions use <b>--area</b>.

              If  <b>--histogram  </b>is  given the report will include the bin
              count and latency boundary values for any configured  his‐
              tograms.

       <b>print </b>[<i>device_name</i>] [<b>--clear</b>] [<b>--allprograms</b>|<b>--programid </b><i>id</i>]
              [<b>--allregions</b>|<b>--regionid </b><i>id</i>]
              Print  raw statistics counters for the specified region or
              for all present regions.

       <b>report </b>[<i>device_name</i>] [<b>--interval </b><i>seconds</i>] [<b>--count </b><i>count</i>]
              [<b>--units </b><i>units</i>] [<b>--histogram</b>] [<b>--allprograms</b>|<b>--programid</b>
              <i>id</i>] [<b>--allregions</b>|<b>--regionid </b><i>id</i>] [<b>--area</b>] [<b>--region</b>]
              [<b>--group</b>] [<b>-O</b>|<b>--sort </b><i>sort_fields</i>] [<b>-S</b>|<b>--select </b><i>selection</i>]
              [<b>--units </b><i>units</i>] [<b>--nosuffix</b>] [<b>--notimesuffix</b>]
              Start a report for the specified object or for all present
              objects. If the count argument is  specified,  the  report
              will  repeat at a fixed interval set by the <b>--interval </b>op‐
              tion. The default interval is one second.

              If the <b>--allprograms </b>switch is given, all regions will  be
              listed, regardless of region program ID values.

              If  the  <b>--histogram  </b>is given the report will include the
              histogram values and latency boundaries.

              If the <b>--relative </b>is used the default histogram field dis‐
              plays bin values as a percentage of the  total  number  of
              I/Os.

              Object types (areas, regions and groups) to include in the
              report  are  selected  using  the  <b>--area</b>,  <b>--region</b>,  and
              <b>--group </b>options.

       <b>ungroup </b>[<i>device_name</i>|<b>--alldevices</b>] [<b>--groupid </b><i>id</i>]
              Remove an existing group and return all  the  group's  re‐
              gions to their original state.

              The group to be removed is specified using <b>--groupid</b>.

       <b>update_filemap </b><i>file_path</i> [<b>--groupid </b><i>id</i>] [<b>--follow </b><i>follow_mode</i>]
              [<b>--foreground</b>]
              Update  a  group of <b>dmstats </b>regions specified by <b>group_id</b>,
              that were previously created with  <b>--filemap</b>,  either  di‐
              rectly, or by starting the monitoring daemon, <b>dmfilemapd</b>.

              This will add and remove regions to reflect changes in the
              allocated extents of the file on-disk, since the time that
              it was crated or last updated.

              Use  of  this command is not normally needed since the <b>dm‐</b>
              <b>filemapd </b>daemon will automatically monitor filemap  groups
              and perform these updates when required.

              If a filemapped group was created with <b>--nomonitor</b>, or the
              daemon  has been killed, the <b>update_filemap </b>can be used to
              manually force an update or start a new daemon.

              Use <b>--nomonitor </b>to  force  a  direct  update  and  disable
              starting the monitoring daemon.
</pre> <h2>
REGIONS, AREAS, AND GROUPS </h2>
<pre>
       The device-mapper statistics facility allows separate performance
       counters to be maintained for arbitrary regions of devices. A re‐
       gion  may  span  any range: from a single sector to the whole de‐
       vice. A region may be further sub-divided into a number  of  dis‐
       tinct areas (one or more), each with its own counter set. In this
       case  a summary value for the entire region is also available for
       use in reports.

       In addition, one or more regions on one device  can  be  combined
       into  a  statistics group. Groups allow several regions to be ag‐
       gregated and reported as a single entity; counters  for  all  re‐
       gions  and  areas  are  summed  and used to report totals for all
       group members. Groups also permit the assignment of  an  optional
       alias,  allowing  meaningful  names to be associated with sets of
       regions.

       The group metadata is stored with the first (lowest numbered) <b>re‐</b>
       <b>gion_id </b>in the group: deleting this region will also  delete  the
       group  and  other  group  members will be returned to their prior
       state.

       By default new regions span the entire device.  The  <b>--start  </b>and
       <b>--length  </b>options allows a region of any size to be placed at any
       location on the device.

       Using offsets it is possible to create regions that map  individ‐
       ual objects within a block device (for example: partitions, files
       in  a  file system, or stripes or other structures in a RAID vol‐
       ume). Groups allow several non-contiguous regions to be assembled
       together for reporting and data aggregation.

       A region may be either  divided  into  the  specified  number  of
       equal-sized  areas, or into areas of the given size by specifying
       one of <b>--areas </b>or <b>--areasize </b>when creating a region with the <b>cre‐</b>
       <b>ate </b>command. Depending on the size of the areas  and  the  device
       region  the  final area within the region may be smaller than re‐
       quested.

   <b>Region identifiers</b>
       Each region is assigned an identifier when it is created that  is
       used  to  reference  the  region in subsequent operations. Region
       identifiers are unique within a given  device  (including  across
       different <b>program_id </b>values).

       Depending  on  the sequence of create and delete operations, gaps
       may exist in the sequence of <b>region_id </b>values  for  a  particular
       device.

       The  <b>region_id  </b>should be treated as an opaque identifier used to
       reference the region.

   <b>Group identifiers</b>
       Groups are also assigned an integer identifier at creation  time;
       like  region identifiers, group identifiers are unique within the
       containing device.

       The <b>group_id </b>should be treated as an opaque  identifier  used  to
       reference the group.
</pre> <h2>
FILE MAPPING </h2>
<pre>
       Using <b>--filemap</b>, it is possible to create regions that correspond
       to  the extents of a file in the file system. This allows IO sta‐
       tistics to be monitored on a per-file basis, for example  to  ob‐
       serve  large  database  files,  virtual  machine images, or other
       files of interest.

       To be able to use file mapping, the file must be backed by a  de‐
       vice-mapper device, and in a file system that supports the FIEMAP
       ioctl (and which returns data describing the physical location of
       extents). This currently includes <a href="../man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a> and <a href="../man5/ext4.5.html">ext4(5)</a>.

       By  default the regions making up a file are placed together in a
       group, and the group alias is set to the <a href="../man3/basename.3.html">basename(3)</a> of the file.
       This allows statistics to be reported for the file  as  a  whole,
       aggregating  values  for  the regions making up the group. To see
       only the whole file (group) when using the <b>list </b>and  <b>report  </b>com‐
       mands, use <b>--group</b>.

       Since  it  is  possible  for the file to change after the initial
       group of regions is created, the <b>update_filemap </b>command, and  <b>dm‐</b>
       <b>filemapd  </b>daemon are provided to update file mapped groups either
       manually or automatically.

   <b>File follow modes</b>
       The file map monitoring daemon can monitor files in two  distinct
       ways: follow-inode mode, and follow-path mode.

       The  mode  affects  the behaviour of the daemon when a file under
       monitoring is renamed or unlinked, and the conditions which cause
       the daemon to terminate.

       If follow-inode mode is used, the daemon will hold the file open,
       and continue to update regions from  the  same  file  descriptor.
       This  means that the mapping will follow rename, move (within the
       same file system), and unlink operations. This mode is useful  if
       the  file  is expected to be moved, renamed, or unlinked while it
       is being monitored.

       In follow-inode mode, the daemon will exit once it  detects  that
       the  file has been unlinked and it is the last holder of a refer‐
       ence to it.

       If follow-path is used, the daemon will re-open the provided path
       on each monitoring iteration. This means that the group  will  be
       updated to reflect a new file being moved to the same path as the
       original file. This mode is useful for files that are expected to
       be updated via unlink and rename.

       In  follow-path mode, the daemon will exit if the file is removed
       and not replaced within a brief tolerance interval (one second).

       To stop the daemon, delete the group containing  the  mapped  re‐
       gions: the daemon will automatically shut down.

       The  daemon  can  also be safely killed at any time and the group
       kept: if the file is still being allocated the mapping  will  be‐
       come  progressively  out-of-date as extents are added and removed
       (in this case the daemon can be re-started or the  group  updated
       manually with the <b>update_filemap </b>command).

       See  the  <b>create </b>command and <b>--filemap</b>, <b>--follow</b>, and <b>--nomonitor</b>
       options for further information.

   <b>Limitations</b>
       The daemon attempts to maintain good synchronisation between  the
       file  extents  and  the  regions contained in the group, however,
       since it can only react to new allocations once  they  have  been
       written,  there  are  inevitably  some  IO  events that cannot be
       counted when a file is growing, particularly if the file is being
       extended by a single thread writing beyond end-of-file (for exam‐
       ple, the <b>dd </b>program).

       There is a further loss of events in that there is  currently  no
       way  to  atomically resize a <b>dmstats </b>region and preserve its cur‐
       rent counter values. This affects files when they grow by extend‐
       ing the final extent, rather than allocating a  new  extent:  any
       events that had accumulated in the region between any prior oper‐
       ation and the resize are lost.

       File  mapping  is currently most effective in cases where the ma‐
       jority of IO does not trigger extent allocation.  Future  updates
       may address these limitations when kernel support is available.
</pre> <h2>
REPORT FIELDS </h2>
<pre>
       The  dmstats  report  provides several types of field that may be
       added to the default field set, or used to create custom reports.

       All performance counters and metrics are calculated per-area.

   <b>Derived metrics</b>
       A number of metrics fields are included that provide  high  level
       performance indicators. These are based on the fields provided by
       the  conventional  Linux  iostat program and are derived from the
       basic counter values provided by the kernel for each area.

       <b>reads_merged_per_sec</b>
              Reads merged per second.

       <b>writes_merged_per_sec</b>
              Writes merged per second.

       <b>reads_per_sec</b>
              Reads completed per second.

       <b>writes_per_sec</b>
              Writes completed per second.

       <b>read_size_per_sec</b>
              Size of data read per second.

       <b>write_size_per_sec</b>
              Size of data written per second.

       <b>avg_request_size</b>
              Average request size.

       <b>queue_size</b>
              Average queue size.

       <b>await  </b>The average wait time for read and write operations.

       <b>r_await</b>
              The average wait time for read operations.

       <b>w_await</b>
              The average wait time for write operations.

       <b>throughput</b>
              The device throughput in operations per second.

       <b>service_time</b>
              The average service time (in milliseconds) for operations
              issued to the device.

       <b>util   </b>Percentage of CPU time during which I/O requests were is‐
              sued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the device).
              Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100%.

   <b>Group, region and area meta fields</b>
       Meta fields provide information about the groups, regions, or ar‐
       eas that the statistics values relate to. This includes the re‐
       gion and area identifier, start, length, and counts, as well as
       the program ID and user data values.

       <b>region_id</b>
              Region identifier. This is a non-negative integer returned
              by the kernel when a statistics region is created.

       <b>region_start</b>
              The region start location. Display units are selected by
              the <b>--units </b>option.

       <b>region_len</b>
              The length of the region. Display units are selected by
              the <b>--units </b>option.

       <b>area_id</b>
              Area identifier. Area identifiers are assigned by the de‐
              vice-mapper statistics library and uniquely identify each
              area within a region. Each ID corresponds to a distinct
              set of performance counters for that area of the statis‐
              tics region. Area identifiers are always monotonically in‐
              creasing within a region so that higher ID values corre‐
              spond to greater sector addresses within the area and no
              gaps in the sequence of identifiers exist.

       <b>area_start</b>
              The area start location. Display units are selected by the
              <b>--units </b>option.

       <b>area_len</b>
              The length of the area. Display units are selected by the
              <b>--units </b>option.

       <b>area_count</b>
              The number of areas in this region.

       <b>program_id</b>
              The program ID value associated with this region.

       <b>user_data</b>
              The user data value associated with this region.

       <b>group_id</b>
              Group identifier. This is a non-negative integer returned
              by the dmstats <b>group </b>command when a statistics group is
              created.

       <b>interval_ns</b>
              The estimated interval over which the current counter val‐
              ues have accumulated. The value is reported as an integer
              expressed in units of nanoseconds.

       <b>interval</b>
              The estimated interval over which the current counter val‐
              ues have accumulated. The value is reported as a real num‐
              ber in units of seconds.

   <b>Basic counters</b>
       Basic counters provide access to the raw counter data from the
       kernel, allowing further processing to be carried out by another
       program.

       The kernel provides thirteen separate counters for each statis‐
       tics area. The first eleven of these match the counters provided
       in /proc/diskstats or /sys/block/*/*/stat. The final pair provide
       separate counters for read and write time.

       <b>read_count</b>
              Count of reads completed this interval.

       <b>reads_merged_count</b>
              Count of reads merged this interval.

       <b>read_sector_count</b>
              Count of 512 byte sectors read this interval.

       <b>read_time</b>
              Accumulated duration of all read requests (ns).

       <b>write_count</b>
              Count of writes completed this interval.

       <b>writes_merged_count</b>
              Count of writes merged this interval.

       <b>write_sector_count</b>
              Count of 512 byte sectors written this interval.

       <b>write_time</b>
              Accumulated duration of all write requests (ns).

       <b>in_progress_count</b>
              Count of requests currently in progress.

       <b>io_ticks</b>
              Nanoseconds spent servicing requests.

       <b>queue_ticks</b>
              This field is incremented at each I/O start, I/O comple‐
              tion, I/O merge, or read of these stats by the number of
              I/Os in progress multiplied by the number of milliseconds
              spent doing I/O since the last update of this field.  This
              can provide an easy measure of both I/O completion time
              and the backlog that may be accumulating.

       <b>read_ticks</b>
              Nanoseconds spent servicing reads.

       <b>write_ticks</b>
              Nanoseconds spent servicing writes.

   <b>Histogram fields</b>
       Histograms measure the frequency distribution of user specified
       I/O latency intervals. Histogram bin boundaries are specified
       when a region is created.

       A brief representation of the histogram values and latency inter‐
       vals can be included in the report using these fields.

       <b>hist_count</b>
              A list of the histogram counts for the current statistics
              area in order of ascending latency value. Each value rep‐
              resents the number of I/Os with latency times falling into
              that bin's time range during the sample period.

       <b>hist_count_bounds</b>
              A list of the histogram counts for the current statistics
              area in order of ascending latency value including bin
              boundaries: each count is prefixed by the lower bound of
              the corresponding histogram bin.

       <b>hist_count_ranges</b>
              A list of the histogram counts for the current statistics
              area in order of ascending latency value including bin
              boundaries: each count is prefixed by both the lower and
              upper bounds of the corresponding histogram bin.

       <b>hist_percent</b>
              A list of the relative histogram values for the current
              statistics area in order of ascending latency value, ex‐
              pressed as a percentage. Each value represents the propor‐
              tion of I/Os with latency times falling into that bin's
              time range during the sample period.

       <b>hist_percent_bounds</b>
              A list of the relative histogram values for the current
              statistics area in order of ascending latency value, ex‐
              pressed as a percentage and including bin boundaries. Each
              value represents the proportion of I/Os with latency times
              falling into that bin's time range during the sample peri‐
              od and is prefixed with the corresponding bin's lower
              bound.

       <b>hist_percent_ranges</b>
              A list of the relative histogram values for the current
              statistics area in order of ascending latency value, ex‐
              pressed as a percentage and including bin boundaries. Each
              value represents the proportion of I/Os with latency times
              falling into that bin's time range during the sample peri‐
              od and is prefixed with the corresponding bin's lower and
              upper bounds.

       <b>hist_bounds</b>
              A list of the histogram boundary values for the current
              statistics area in order of ascending latency value.  The
              values are expressed in whole units of seconds, milisec‐
              onds, microseconds or nanoseconds with a suffix indicating
              the unit.

       <b>hist_ranges</b>
              A list of the histogram bin ranges for the current statis‐
              tics area in order of ascending latency value.  The values
              are expressed as "LOWER-UPPER" in whole units of seconds,
              miliseconds, microseconds or nanoseconds with a suffix in‐
              dicating the unit.

       <b>hist_bins</b>
              The number of latency histogram bins configured for the
              area.
