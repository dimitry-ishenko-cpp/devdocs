</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       logsave - save the output of a command in a logfile
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>logsave </b>[ <b>-asv </b>] <i>logfile cmd_prog [ ... ]</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>logsave </b>program will execute <i>cmd_prog</i> with the specified
       argument(s), and save a copy of its output to <i>logfile</i>.  If the
       containing directory for <i>logfile</i> does not exist, <b>logsave </b>will
       accumulate the output in memory until it can be written out.  A
       copy of the output will also be written to standard output.

       If <i>cmd_prog</i> is a single hyphen ('-'), then instead of executing a
       program, <b>logsave </b>will take its input from standard input and save
       it in <i>logfile</i>

       <b>logsave </b>is useful for saving the output of initial boot scripts
       until the /var partition is mounted, so the output can be written
       to /var/log.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a     </b>This option will cause the output to be appended to
              <i>logfile</i>, instead of replacing its current contents.

       <b>-s     </b>This option will cause <b>logsave </b>to skip writing to the log
              file text which is bracketed with a control-A (ASCII 001
              or Start of Header) and control-B (ASCII 002 or Start of
              Text).  This allows progress bar information to be visible
              to the user on the console, while not being written to the
              log file.

       <b>-v     </b>This option will make <b>logsave </b>to be more verbose in its
              output to the user.
