NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_stress - The stress-testing PAM module
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_stress.so </b>[debug] [no_warn] [use_first_pass] [try_first_pass]
                     [rootok] [expired] [fail_1] [fail_2] [prelim]
                     [required]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_stress PAM module is mainly intended to give the
       impression of failing as a fully functioning module might.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debug</b>
           Put lots of information in syslog. *NOTE* this option writes
           passwords to syslog, so don't use anything sensitive when
           testing.

       <b>no_warn</b>
           Do not give warnings about things (otherwise warnings are
           issued via the conversation function)

       <b>use_first_pass</b>
           Do not prompt for a password, for pam_sm_authentication
           function just use item PAM_AUTHTOK.

       <b>try_first_pass</b>
           Do not prompt for a password unless there has been no
           previous authentication token (item PAM_AUTHTOK is NULL)

       <b>rootok</b>
           This is intended for the pam_sm_chauthtok function and it
           instructs this function to permit root to change the user's
           password without entering the old password.

       <b>expired</b>
           An argument intended for the account and chauthtok module
           parts. It instructs the module to act as if the user's
           password has expired

       <b>fail_1</b>
           This instructs the module to make its first function fail.

       <b>fail_2</b>
           This instructs the module to make its second function (if
           there is one) fail.

       <b>prelim</b>
           For pam_sm_chauthtok, means fail on PAM_PRELIM_CHECK.

       <b>required</b>
           For pam_sm_chauthtok, means fail if the user hasn't already
           been authenticated by this module. (See stress_new_pwd data
           string in the NOTES.)

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       This module uses the stress_new_pwd data string which tells
       pam_sm_chauthtok that pam_sm_acct_mgmt says we need a new
       password. The only possible value for this data string is 'yes'.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>

           #%PAM-1.0
           #

           account  required pam_stress.so
           auth     required pam_stress.so
