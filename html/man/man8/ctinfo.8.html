       ctinfo - tc connmark processing action
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tc ... action ctinfo </b>[ <b>dscp </b>MASK [STATEMASK] ] [ <b>cpmark </b>[MASK] ]
       [ <b>zone </b>ZONE ] [ <b>CONTROL </b>] [ <b>index </b>&lt;INDEX&gt; ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       CTINFO (Conntrack Information) is a tc action for retrieving data
       from conntrack marks into various fields.  At present it has two
       independent processing modes which may be viewed as sub-
       functions.

       DSCP mode copies a DSCP stored in conntrack's connmark into the
       IPv4/v6 diffserv field.  The copying may conditionally occur
       based on a flag also stored in the connmark.  DSCP mode was
       designed to assist in restoring packet classifications on
       ingress, classifications which may then be used by qdiscs such as
       CAKE.  It may be used in any circumstance where ingress
       classification needs to be maintained across links that otherwise
       bleach or remap according to their own policies.

       CPMARK (copymark) mode copies the conntrack connmark into the
       packet's mark field.  Without additional parameters it is
       functionally completely equivalent to the existing connmark
       action.  An optional mask may be specified to mask which bits of
       the connmark are restored.  This may be useful when DSCP and
       CPMARK modes are combined.

       Simple statistics (tc -s) on DSCP restores and CPMARK copies are
       maintained where values for set indicate a count of packets
       altered for that mode.  DSCP includes an error count where the
       destination packet's diffserv field was unwriteable.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>DSCP mode parameters:</b>
       mask   A mask of 6 contiguous bits indicating where the DSCP
              value is located in the 32 bit conntrack mark field.  A
              mask must be provided for this mode.  mask is a 32 bit
              unsigned value.

       statemask
              A mask of at least 1 bit indicating where a conditional
              restore flag is located in the 32 bit conntrack mark
              field.  The statemask bit/s must NOT overlap the mask
              bits.  The DSCP will be restored if the conntrack mark
              logically ANDed with the statemask yields a non-zero
              result.  statemask is an optional unsigned 32 bit value.

   <b>CPMARK mode parameters:</b>
       mask   Store the logically ANDed result of conntrack mark and
              mask into the packet's mark field.  Default is 0xffffffff
              i.e. the whole mark field.  mask is an optional unsigned
              32 bit value

   <b>Overall action parameters:</b>
       zone   Specify the conntrack zone when doing conntrack lookups
              for packets.  zone is a 16bit unsigned decimal value.
              Default is 0.

       CONTROL
              The following keywords allow one to control how the tree
              of qdisc, classes, filters and actions is further
              traversed after this action.

              <b>reclassify</b>
                     Restart with the first filter in the current list.

              <b>pipe   </b>Continue with the next action attached to the same
                     filter.

              <b>drop   </b>Drop the packet.

              <b>shot   </b>synonym for <b>drop</b>

              <b>continue</b>
                     Continue classification with the next filter in
                     line.

              <b>pass   </b>Finish classification process and return to calling
                     qdisc for further packet processing. This is the
                     default.

       index  Specify an index for this action in order to being able to
              identify it in later commands. index is a 32bit unsigned
              decimal value.

       Example showing conditional restoration of DSCP on ingress via an
       IFB

              #Set up the IFB interface
              tc qdisc add dev ifb4eth0 handle ffff: ingress

              #Put CAKE qdisc on it
              tc qdisc add dev ifb4eth0 root cake bandwidth 40mbit

              #Set interface UP
              ip link set dev ifb4eth0 up

              #Add 2 actions, ctinfo to restore dscp &amp; mirred to redirect the packets to IFB
              tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: protocol all prio 10 u32 \

                  ctinfo dscp 0xfc000000 0x01000000  \
                  mirred egress redirect dev ifb4eth0

              tc -s qdisc show dev eth0 ingress

       Example showing conditional restoration of DSCP on egress

       This may appear nonsensical since iptables marking of egress
       packets is easy to achieve, however the iptables flow
       classification rules may be extensive and so some sort of set
       once and forget may be useful especially on cpu constrained
       devices.

              # Send unmarked connections to a marking chain which needs to store a DSCP
              and set statemask bit in the connmark
              iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -m connmark \
                  --mark 0x00000000/0x01000000 -g CLASS_MARKING_CHAIN

              # Apply marked DSCP to the packets
              tc filter add dev eth0 protocol all prio 10 u32 \
                  match u32 0 0 flowid 1:1 action \
                  ctinfo dscp 0xfc000000 0x01000000

              tc -s filter show dev eth0
               filter parent 800e: protocol all pref 10 u32 chain 0
               filter parent 800e: protocol all pref 10 u32 chain 0 fh 800: ht divisor 1
               filter parent 800e: protocol all pref 10 u32 chain 0 fh 800::800 order 2048 key ht 800 bkt 0 flowid 1:1 not_in_hw
                match 00000000/00000000 at 0
                  action order 1: ctinfo zone 0 pipe
                  index 1 ref 1 bind 1 dscp 0xfc000000 0x01000000 installed 7414 sec used 0 sec DSCP set 53404 error 0 CPMARK set 0
