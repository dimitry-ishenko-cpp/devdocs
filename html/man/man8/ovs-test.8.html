DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>ovs-test </b>program may be used to check for problems sending
       802.1Q or GRE traffic that Open vSwitch may uncover. These
       problems, for example, can occur when Open vSwitch is used to
       send 802.1Q traffic through physical interfaces running certain
       drivers of certain Linux kernel versions.  To run a test,
       configure IP addresses on <i>server1</i> and <i>server2</i> for interfaces you
       intended to test. These interfaces could also be already
       configured OVS bridges that have a physical interface attached to
       them. Then, on one of the nodes, run <b>ovs-test </b>in server mode and
       on the other node run it in client mode. The client will connect
       to <b>ovs-test </b>server and schedule tests between both of them. The
       <b>ovs-test </b>client will perform UDP and TCP tests.

       UDP tests can report packet loss and achieved bandwidth for
       various datagram sizes. By default target bandwidth for UDP tests
       is 1Mbit/s.

       TCP tests report only achieved bandwidth, because kernel TCP
       stack takes care of flow control and packet loss. TCP tests are
       essential to detect potential TSO related issues.

       To determine whether Open vSwitch is encountering any problems,
       the user must compare packet loss and achieved bandwidth in a
       setup where traffic is being directly sent and in one where it is
       not. If in the 802.1Q or L3 tunneled tests both <b>ovs-test</b>
       processes are unable to communicate or the achieved bandwidth is
       much lower compared to direct setup, then, most likely, Open
       vSwitch has encountered a pre-existing kernel or driver bug.

       Some examples of the types of problems that may be encountered
       are:

       • When NICs use VLAN stripping on receive they must pass a
         pointer to a <i>vlan_group</i> when reporting the stripped tag to the
         networking core. If no <i>vlan_group</i> is in use then some drivers
         just drop the extracted tag.  Drivers are supposed to only
         enable stripping if a <i>vlan_group</i> is registered but not all of
         them do that.

       • On receive, some drivers handle priority tagged packets
         specially and don’t pass the tag onto the network stack at all,
         so Open vSwitch never has a chance to see it.

       • Some drivers size their receive buffers based on whether a
         <i>vlan_group</i> is enabled, meaning that a maximum size packet with
         a VLAN tag will not fit if no <i>vlan_group</i> is configured.

       • On transmit, some drivers expect that VLAN acceleration will be
         used if it is available, which can only be done if a <i>vlan_group</i>
         is configured. In these cases, the driver may fail to parse the
         packet and correctly setup checksum offloading or TSO.

       <b>Client Mode</b>
              An <b>ovs-test </b>client will connect to two <b>ovs-test </b>servers
              and will ask them to exchange test traffic. It is also
              possible to spawn an <b>ovs-test </b>server automatically from
              the client.

       <b>Server Mode</b>
              To conduct tests, two <b>ovs-test </b>servers must be running on
              two different hosts where the client can connect. The
              actual test traffic is exchanged only between both
              <b>ovs-test </b>servers. It is recommended that both servers have
              their IP addresses in the same subnet, otherwise one would
              have to make sure that routing is set up correctly.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-s &lt;port&gt;, --server &lt;port&gt;</b>
              Run in server mode and wait for the client to establish
              XML RPC Control Connection on this TCP port. It is
              recommended to have <a href="ethtool.8.html">ethtool(8)</a> installed on the server so
              that it could retrieve information about the NIC driver.

       <b>-c &lt;server1&gt; &lt;server2&gt;, --client &lt;server1&gt; &lt;server2&gt;</b>
              Run in client mode and schedule tests between <i>server1</i> and
              <i>server2</i>, where each server must be given in the following
              format:

                 OuterIP[:OuterPort],InnerIP[/Mask][:InnerPort].

              The <i>OuterIP</i> must be already assigned to the physical
              interface which is going to be tested. This is the IP
              address where client will try to establish XML RPC
              connection. If <i>OuterIP</i> is 127.0.0.1 then client will
              automatically spawn a local instance of <b>ovs-test </b>server.
              OuterPort is TCP port where server is listening for
              incoming XML/RPC control connections to schedule tests (by
              default it is 15531). The <b>ovs-test </b>will automatically
              assign <i>InnerIP[/Mask]</i> to the interfaces that will be
              created on the fly for testing purposes. It is important
              that <i>InnerIP[/Mask]</i> does not interfere with already
              existing IP addresses on both <b>ovs-test </b>servers and client.
              InnerPort is port which will be used by server to listen
              for test traffic that will be encapsulated (by default it
              is 15532).

       <b>-b &lt;targetbandwidth&gt;, --bandwidth &lt;targetbandwidth&gt;</b>
              Target bandwidth for UDP tests. The targetbandwidth must
              be given in bits per second. It is possible to use postfix
              <i>M</i> or <i>K</i> to alter the target bandwidth magnitude.

       <b>-i &lt;testinterval&gt;, --interval &lt;testinterval&gt;</b>
              How long each test should run. By default 5 seconds.

       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V, --version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

       The following test modes are supported by <b>ovs-test</b>. It is
       possible to combine multiple of them in a single <b>ovs-test</b>
       invocation.

       <b>-d, --direct</b>
              Perform direct tests between both OuterIP addresses. These
              tests could be used as a reference to compare 802.1Q or L3
              tunneling test results.

       <b>-l &lt;vlantag&gt;, --vlan-tag &lt;vlantag&gt;</b>
              Perform 802.1Q tests between both servers. These tests
              will create a temporary OVS bridge, if necessary, and
              attach a VLAN tagged port to it for testing purposes.

       <b>-t &lt;tunnelmodes&gt;, --tunnel-modes &lt;tunnelmodes&gt;</b>
              Perform L3 tunneling tests. The given argument is a comma
              sepa‐ rated string that specifies all the L3 tunnel modes
              that should be tested (e.g.  gre). The L3 tunnels are
              terminated on interface that has the OuterIP address
              assigned.

       and GRE tests between both nodes:

          ovs-test -c 127.0.0.1,1.1.1.1/30 1.2.3.4,1.1.1.2/30 -d -l 123 -t
