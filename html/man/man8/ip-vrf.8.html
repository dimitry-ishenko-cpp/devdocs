DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A VRF provides traffic isolation at layer 3 for routing, similar
       to how a VLAN is used to isolate traffic at layer 2.
       Fundamentally, a VRF is a separate routing table. Network devices
       are associated with a VRF by enslaving the device to the VRF. At
       that point network addresses assigned to the device are local to
       the VRF with host and connected routes moved to the table
       associated with the VRF.

       A process can specify a VRF using several APIs -- binding the
       socket to the VRF device using SO_BINDTODEVICE, setting the VRF
       association using IP_UNICAST_IF or IPV6_UNICAST_IF, or specifying
       the VRF for a specific message using IP_PKTINFO or IPV6_PKTINFO.

       By default a process is not bound to any VRF. An association can
       be set explicitly by making the program use one of the APIs
       mentioned above or implicitly using a helper to set
       SO_BINDTODEVICE for all IPv4 and IPv6 sockets (AF_INET and
       AF_INET6) when the socket is created. This ip-vrf command is a
       helper to run a command against a specific VRF with the VRF
       association inherited parent to child.

       <b>ip vrf show [ NAME ] - Show all configured VRF</b>

              This command lists all VRF and their corresponding table
              ids. If NAME is given, then only that VRF and table id is
              shown. The latter command is useful for scripting where
              the table id for a VRF is needed.

       <b>ip vrf exec [ NAME ] cmd ... - Run cmd against the named VRF</b>

              This command allows applications that are VRF unaware to
              be run against a VRF other than the default VRF (main
              table). A command can be run against the default VRF by
              passing the "default" as the VRF name. This is useful if
              the current shell is associated with another VRF (e.g,
              Management VRF).

              This command requires the system to be booted with cgroup
              v2 (e.g. with systemd, add
              systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1 to the kernel command
              line).

              This command also requires to be run as root.
              Alternatively it can be run by an unprivileged user if the
              following <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a> are given:

              <b>CAP_BPF</b>
                     To load the BPF program.

              <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>
                     To set the socket into the cgroup.

              <b>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</b>
                     To create the cgroup subdir in /sys.

              If these capabilities are added and if <a href="ip.8.html">ip(8)</a> is built with
              <a href="../man3/libcap.3.html">libcap(3)</a> then these capabilities will be dropped before
              <b>cmd </b>is executed by <b>ip vrf exec.  </b>For every other
              unprivileged invocation of <a href="ip.8.html">ip(8)</a> all capabilities will be
              dropped.

              <b>NOTE: </b>capabilities will <b>NOT </b>be dropped if <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN </b>is
              set to <b>INHERITABLE </b>to avoid breaking programs with ambient
              capabilities that call ip.

       <b>ip vrf identify [PID] - Report VRF association for process</b>

              This command shows the VRF association of the specified
              process. If PID is not specified then the id of the
              current process is used.

       <b>ip vrf pids NAME - Report processes associated with the named VRF</b>

              This command shows all process ids that are associated
              with the given VRF.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       This command requires a kernel compiled with CGROUPS and
       CGROUP_BPF enabled.

       The VRF helper *only* affects network layer sockets.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       ip vrf exec red ssh 10.100.1.254
              Executes ssh to 10.100.1.254 against the VRF red table.
