NAME </h2>
<pre>
       nfsdcld - NFSv4 Client Tracking Daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       nfsdcld [-d] [-F] [-p path] [-s stable storage dir]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       nfsdcld is the NFSv4 client tracking daemon. It is not necessary
       to run this daemon on machines that are not acting as NFSv4
       servers.

       When a network partition is combined with a server reboot, there
       are edge conditions that can cause the server to grant lock
       reclaims when other clients have taken conflicting locks in the
       interim. A more detailed explanation of this issue is described
       in RFC 3530, section 8.6.3.

       In order to prevent these problems, the server must track a small
       amount of per-client information on stable storage. This daemon
       provides the userspace piece of that functionality.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
           Enable debug level logging.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--foreground</b>
           Runs the daemon in the foreground and prints all output to
           stderr

       <b>-p </b><i>path</i>, <b>--pipefsdir</b>=<i>path</i>
           Location of the rpc_pipefs filesystem. The default value is
           <i>/var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs</i>.

       <b>-s </b><i>storage_dir</i>, <b>--storagedir</b>=<i>storage_dir</i>
           Directory where stable storage information should be kept.
           The default value is <i>/var/lib/nfs/nfsdcld</i>.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE </h2>
<pre>
       The following values are recognized in the <b>[nfsdcld] </b>section of
       the <i>/etc/nfs.conf</i> configuration file:

       <b>storagedir</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-s</b>/<b>--storagedir</b>.

       <b>debug</b>
           Setting "debug = 1" is equivalent to <b>-d</b>/<b>--debug</b>.

       In addition, the following value is recognized from the <b>[general]</b>
       section:

       <b>pipefs-directory</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-p</b>/<b>--pipefsdir</b>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The Linux kernel NFSv4 server has historically tracked this
       information on stable storage by manipulating information on the
       filesystem directly, in the directory to which
       <i>/proc/fs/nfsd/nfsv4recoverydir</i> points.

       This changed with the original introduction of <b>nfsdcld </b>upcall in
       kernel version 3.4, which was later deprecated in favor of the
       <a href="nfsdcltrack.8.html">nfsdcltrack(8)</a> usermodehelper program, support for which was
       added in kernel version 3.8.  However, since the usermodehelper
       upcall does not work in containers, support for a new version of
       the <b>nfsdcld </b>upcall was added in kernel version 5.2.

       This daemon requires a kernel that supports the <b>nfsdcld </b>upcall.
       On older kernels, if the legacy client name tracking code was in
       use, then the kernel would not create the pipe that <b>nfsdcld </b>uses
       to talk to the kernel.  On newer kernels, nfsd attempts to
       initialize client tracking in the following order:  First, the
       <b>nfsdcld </b>upcall.  Second, the <b>nfsdcltrack </b>usermodehelper upcall.
       Finally, the legacy client tracking.

       This daemon should be run as root, as the pipe that it uses to
       communicate with the kernel is only accessible by root. The
       daemon however does drop all superuser capabilities after
       starting. Because of this, the <i>storagedir</i> should be owned by
       root, and be readable and writable by owner.

       The daemon now supports different upcall versions to allow the
       kernel to pass additional data to be stored in the on-disk
       database.  The kernel will query the supported upcall version
       from <b>nfsdcld </b>during client tracking initialization.  A restart of
       <b>nfsd </b>is not necessary after upgrading <b>nfsdcld</b>, however <b>nfsd </b>will
       not use a later upcall version until restart.  A restart of <b>nfsd</b>
       <b>is necessary </b>after downgrading <b>nfsdcld</b>, to ensure that <b>nfsd </b>does
       not use an upcall version that <b>nfsdcld </b>does not support.
       Additionally, a downgrade of <b>nfsdcld </b>requires the schema of the
       on-disk database to be downgraded as well.  That can be
       accomplished using the <a href="nfsdclddb.8.html">nfsdclddb(8)</a> utility.
