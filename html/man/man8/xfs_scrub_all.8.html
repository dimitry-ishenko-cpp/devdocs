NAME </h2>
<pre>
       xfs_scrub_all - scrub all mounted XFS filesystems
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_scrub_all </b>[ <b>-hV </b>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_scrub_all </b>attempts to read and check all the metadata on all
       mounted XFS filesystems.  The online scrub is performed via the
       <b>xfs_scrub </b>tool, either by running it directly or by using systemd
       to start it in a restricted fashion.  Mounted filesystems are
       mapped to physical storage devices so that scrub operations can
       be run in parallel so long as no two scrubbers access the same
       device simultaneously.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-h     </b>Display help.

       <b>-V     </b>Prints the version number and exits.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT CODE </h2>
<pre>
       The exit code returned by <b>xfs_scrub_all </b>is the sum of the
       following conditions:
            0    - No errors
            4    - File system errors left uncorrected
            8    - Operational error
            16   - Usage or syntax error

       These are the same error codes returned by xfs_scrub.
