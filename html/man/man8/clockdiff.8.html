</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       clockdiff - measure clock difference between hosts
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>clockdiff </b>[<b>-o</b>] [<b>-o1</b>] [<b>--time-format </b><i>ctime iso</i>] [<b>-V</b>] {destination}
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>clockdiff </b>Measures clock difference between us and <i>destination</i>
       with 1 msec resolution using ICMP TIMESTAMP [2] packets or,
       optionally, IP TIMESTAMP option [3] added to ICMP ECHO. [1]
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-o</b>
           Use IP TIMESTAMP with ICMP ECHO instead of ICMP TIMESTAMP
           messages. It is useful with some destinations, which do not
           support ICMP TIMESTAMP (f.e. Solaris &lt;2.4).

       <b>-o1</b>
           Slightly different form of <b>-o</b>, namely it uses three-term IP
           TIMESTAMP with prespecified hop addresses instead of four
           term one. What flavor works better depends on target host.
           Particularly, <b>-o </b>is better for Linux.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--time-format </b><i>ctime iso</i>
           Print time stamp in output either ISO-8601 format or
           classical ctime format. The ctime format is default. The ISO
           time stamp includes timezone, and is easier to parse.

       <b>-I</b>
           Alias of <b>--time-format </b><i>iso</i> option and argument.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print help and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
WARNINGS </h2>
<pre>
           • Some nodes (Cisco) use non-standard timestamps, which is
           allowed by RFC, but makes timestamps mostly useless.

           • Some nodes generate messed timestamps (Solaris&gt;2.4), when
           run <b>xntpd</b>. Seems, its IP stack uses a corrupted clock source,
           which is synchronized to time-of-day clock periodically and
           jumps randomly making timestamps mostly useless. Good news is
           that you can use NTP in this case, which is even better.

           • <b>clockdiff </b>shows difference in time modulo 24 days.

AUTHOR </h2>
<pre>
       <b>clockdiff </b>was compiled by Alexey Kuznetsov
       &lt;kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru&gt;. It was based on code borrowed from BSD
       <b>timed </b>daemon.
</pre> <h2>
SECURITY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>clockdiff </b>requires CAP_NET_RAW and CAP_SYS_NICE capabilities to
       be executed. It is safe to be used as set-uid root.
