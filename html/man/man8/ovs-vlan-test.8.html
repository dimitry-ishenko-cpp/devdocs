NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ovs-vlan-test - Check Linux drivers for problems with vlan
       traffic
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>[<b>-s </b>| <b>–server</b>] <i>control_ip vlan_ip</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>utility has some limitations, for example, it
       does not use TCP in its tests. Also it does not take into account
       MTU to detect potential edge cases. To overcome those limitations
       a new tool was developed - <b>ovs-test</b>. <b>ovs-test </b>is currently
       supported only on Debian so, if possible, try to use that on
       instead of <b>ovs-vlan-test</b>.

       The <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>program may be used to check for problems
       sending 802.1Q traffic which may occur when running Open vSwitch.
       These problems can occur when Open vSwitch is used to send 802.1Q
       traffic through physical interfaces running certain drivers of
       certain Linux kernel versions. To run a test, configure Open
       vSwitch to tag traffic originating from <i>vlan_ip</i> and forward it
       out the target interface. Then run the <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>in client
       mode connecting to an <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>server.  <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>will
       display “OK” if it did not detect problems.

       Some examples of the types of problems that may be encountered
       are:

       • When NICs use VLAN stripping on receive they must pass a
         pointer to a <i>vlan_group</i> when reporting the stripped tag to the
         networking core. If no <i>vlan_group</i> is in use then some drivers
         just drop the extracted tag.  Drivers are supposed to only
         enable stripping if a <i>vlan_group</i> is registered but not all of
         them do that.

       • On receive, some drivers handle priority tagged packets
         specially and don’t pass the tag onto the network stack at all,
         so Open vSwitch never has a chance to see it.

       • Some drivers size their receive buffers based on whether a
         <i>vlan_group</i> is enabled, meaning that a maximum size packet with
         a VLAN tag will not fit if no <i>vlan_group</i> is configured.

       • On transmit, some drivers expect that VLAN acceleration will be
         used if it is available, which can only be done if a <i>vlan_group</i>
         is configured. In these cases, the driver may fail to parse the
         packet and correctly setup checksum offloading or TSO.

       <b>Client Mode</b>
              An <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>client may be run on a host to check for
              VLAN connectivity problems. The client must be able to
              establish HTTP connections with an <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>server
              located at the specified <i>control_ip</i> address. UDP traffic
              sourced at <i>vlan_ip</i> should be tagged and directed out the
              interface whose connectivity is being tested.

       <b>Server Mode</b>
              To conduct tests, an <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>server must be running
              on a host known not to have VLAN connectivity problems.
              The server must have a <i>control_ip</i> on a non-VLAN network
              which clients can establish connectivity with. It must
              also have a <i>vlan_ip</i> address on a VLAN network which
              clients will use to test their VLAN connectivity. Multiple
              clients may test against a single <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>server
              concurrently.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-s, --server</b>
              Run in server mode.

       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V, --version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Display the Linux kernel version and driver of <i>eth1</i>:

          uname -r
          ethtool -i eth1

       Set up a bridge which forwards traffic originating from <i>1.2.3.4</i>
       out <i>eth1</i> with VLAN tag 10:

          ovs-vsctl -- add-br vlan-br \
            -- add-port vlan-br eth1 \
            -- add-port vlan-br vlan-br-tag tag=10 \
            -- set Interface vlan-br-tag type=internal
          ip addr add 1.2.3.4/8 dev vlan-br-tag
          ip link set vlan-br-tag up

       Run an <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>server listening for client control traffic
       on <i>172.16.0.142</i> port <i>8080</i> and VLAN traffic on the default port of
       <i>1.2.3.3</i>:

          ovs-vlan-test -s 172.16.0.142:8080 1.2.3.3

       Run an <b>ovs-vlan-test </b>client with a control server located at
       <i>172.16.0.142</i> port <i>8080</i> and a local VLAN IP of <i>1.2.3.4</i>:

          ovs-vlan-test 172.16.0.142:8080 1.2.3.4
