<pre>
       <b>pppstats </b>[ <b>-a </b>] [ <b>-d </b>] [ <b>-v </b>] [ <b>-r </b>] [ <b>-z </b>] [ <b>-c </b><i>&lt;count&gt;</i> ] [ <b>-w</b>
       <i>&lt;secs&gt;</i> ] [ <i>interface</i> ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pppstats </b>utility reports PPP-related statistics at regular
       intervals for the specified PPP interface.  If the interface is
       unspecified, it will default to ppp0.  The display is split
       horizontally into input and output sections containing columns of
       statistics describing the properties and volume of packets
       received and transmitted by the interface.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-a     </b>Display absolute values rather than deltas.  With this
              option, all reports show statistics for the time since the
              link was initiated.  Without this option, the second and
              subsequent reports show statistics for the time since the
              last report.

       <b>-d     </b>Show data rate (kB/s) instead of bytes.

       <b>-c </b><i>count</i>
              Repeat the display <i>count</i> times.  If this option is not
              specified, the default repeat count is 1 if the <b>-w </b>option
              is not specified, otherwise infinity.

       <b>-r     </b>Display additional statistics summarizing the compression
              ratio achieved by the packet compression algorithm in use.

       <b>-v     </b>Display additional statistics relating to the performance
              of the Van Jacobson TCP header compression algorithm.

       <b>-w </b><i>wait</i>
              Pause <i>wait</i> seconds between each display.  If this option
              is not specified, the default interval is 5 seconds.

       <b>-z     </b>Instead of the standard display, show statistics
              indicating the performance of the packet compression
              algorithm in use.

       The following fields are printed on the input side when the <b>-z</b>
       option is not used:

       <b>IN     </b>The total number of bytes received by this interface.

       <b>PACK   </b>The total number of packets received by this interface.

       <b>VJCOMP </b>The number of header-compressed TCP packets received by
              this interface.

       <b>VJUNC  </b>The number of header-uncompressed TCP packets received by
              this interface.  Not reported when the <b>-r </b>option is
              specified.

       <b>VJERR  </b>The number of corrupted or bogus header-compressed TCP
              packets received by this interface.  Not reported when the
              <b>-r </b>option is specified.

       <b>VJTOSS </b>The number of VJ header-compressed TCP packets dropped on
              reception by this interface because of preceding errors.
              Only reported when the <b>-v </b>option is specified.

       <b>NON-VJ </b>The total number of non-TCP packets received by this
              interface. Only reported when the <b>-v </b>option is specified.

       <b>RATIO  </b>The compression ratio achieved for received packets by the
              packet compression scheme in use, defined as the
              uncompressed size divided by the compressed size.  Only
              reported when the <b>-r </b>option is specified.

       <b>UBYTE  </b>The total number of bytes received, after decompression of
              compressed packets.  Only reported when the <b>-r </b>option is
              specified.

       The following fields are printed on the output side:

       <b>OUT    </b>The total number of bytes transmitted from this interface.

       <b>PACK   </b>The total number of packets transmitted from this
              interface.

       <b>VJCOMP </b>The number of TCP packets transmitted from this interface
              with VJ-compressed TCP headers.

       <b>VJUNC  </b>The number of TCP packets transmitted from this interface
              with VJ-uncompressed TCP headers.  Not reported when the
              <b>-r </b>option is specified.

       <b>NON-VJ </b>The total number of non-TCP packets transmitted from this
              interface.  Not reported when the <b>-r </b>option is specified.

       <b>VJSRCH </b>The number of searches for the cached header entry for a
              VJ header compressed TCP packet.  Only reported when the
              <b>-v </b>option is specified.

       <b>VJMISS </b>The number of failed searches for the cached header entry
              for a VJ header compressed TCP packet.  Only reported when
              the <b>-v </b>option is specified.

       <b>RATIO  </b>The compression ratio achieved for transmitted packets by
              the packet compression scheme in use, defined as the size
              before compression divided by the compressed size.  Only
              reported when the <b>-r </b>option is specified.

       <b>UBYTE  </b>The total number of bytes to be transmitted, before packet
              compression is applied.  Only reported when the <b>-r </b>option
              is specified.

       When the <b>-z </b>option is specified, <b>pppstats </b>instead displays the
       following fields, relating to the packet compression algorithm
       currently in use.  If packet compression is not in use, these
       fields will all display zeroes.  The fields displayed on the
       input side are:

       <b>COMPRESSED BYTE</b>
              The number of bytes of compressed packets received.

       <b>COMPRESSED PACK</b>
              The number of compressed packets received.

       <b>INCOMPRESSIBLE BYTE</b>
              The number of bytes of incompressible packets (that is,
              those which were transmitted in uncompressed form)
              received.

       <b>INCOMPRESSIBLE PACK</b>
              The number of incompressible packets received.

       <b>COMP RATIO</b>
              The recent compression ratio for incoming packets, defined
              as the uncompressed size divided by the compressed size
              (including both compressible and incompressible packets).

       The fields displayed on the output side are:

       <b>COMPRESSED BYTE</b>
              The number of bytes of compressed packets transmitted.

       <b>COMPRESSED PACK</b>
              The number of compressed packets transmitted.

       <b>INCOMPRESSIBLE BYTE</b>
              The number of bytes of incompressible packets transmitted
              (that is, those which were transmitted in uncompressed
              form).

       <b>INCOMPRESSIBLE PACK</b>
              The number of incompressible packets transmitted.

       <b>COMP RATIO</b>
