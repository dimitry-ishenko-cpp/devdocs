NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cryptsetup-resize - resize an active mapping
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cryptsetup </b><i>resize</i> <b>[&lt;options&gt;] &lt;name&gt;</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Resizes an active mapping &lt;name&gt;.

       If --size (in 512-bytes sectors) or --device-size are not
       specified, the size is computed from the underlying device. For
       LUKS it is the size of the underlying device without the area
       reserved for LUKS header (see data payload offset in <b>luksDump</b>
       command). For plain crypt device, the whole device size is used.

       Note that this does not change the raw device geometry, it just
       changes how many sectors of the raw device are represented in the
       mapped device.

       If cryptsetup detected volume key for active device loaded in
       kernel keyring service, resize action would first try to retrieve
       the key using a token. Only if it failed, it’d ask for a
       passphrase to unlock a keyslot (LUKS) or to derive a volume key
       again (plain mode). The kernel keyring is used by default for
       LUKS2 devices.

       <b>&lt;options&gt; </b>can be [--size, --device-size, --token-id,
       --token-only, --token-type, --key-slot, --key-file,
       --keyfile-size, --keyfile-offset, --timeout,
       --disable-external-tokens, --disable-locks, --disable-keyring,
       --verify-passphrase, --timeout, --external-tokens-path].
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--batch-mode, -q</b>
           Suppresses all confirmation questions. Use with care!

           If the --verify-passphrase option is not specified, this
           option also switches off the passphrase verification.

       <b>--debug or --debug-json</b>
           Run in debug mode with full diagnostic logs. Debug output
           lines are always prefixed by <b>#</b>.

           If --debug-json is used, additional LUKS2 JSON data
           structures are printed.

       <b>--device-size </b><i>size[units]</i>
           Sets new size of the device. If unset real device size is
           used.

           If no unit suffix is specified, the size is in bytes.

           Unit suffix can be S for 512 byte sectors, K/M/G/T (or
           KiB,MiB,GiB,TiB) for units with 1024 base or KB/MB/GB/TB for
           1000 base (SI scale).

       <b>--disable-external-tokens</b>
           Disable loading of plugins for external LUKS2 tokens.

       <b>--disable-keyring</b>
           Do not load volume key in kernel keyring and store it
           directly in the dm-crypt target instead. This option is
           supported only for the LUKS2 type.

       <b>--disable-locks</b>
           Disable lock protection for metadata on disk. This option is
           valid only for LUKS2 and ignored for other formats.

           <b>WARNING: </b>Do not use this option unless you run cryptsetup in
           a restricted environment where locking is impossible to
           perform (where /run directory cannot be used).

       <b>--external-tokens-path </b><i>absolute_path</i>
           Override system directory path where cryptsetup searches for
           external token handlers (or token plugins). It must be
           absolute path (starting with '/' character).

       <b>--header &lt;device or file storing the LUKS header&gt;</b>
           Use a detached (separated) metadata device or file where the
           LUKS header is stored. This option allows one to store
           ciphertext and LUKS header on different devices.

           For commands that change the LUKS header (e.g. <i>luksAddKey</i>),
           specify the device or file with the LUKS header directly as
           the LUKS device.

       <b>--help, -?</b>
           Show help text and default parameters.

       <b>--key-description &lt;text&gt;</b>
           Set key description in keyring that will be used for
           passphrase retrieval.

       <b>--key-file, -d </b><i>name</i>
           Read the passphrase from file.

           If the name given is "-", then the passphrase will be read
           from stdin. In this case, reading will not stop at newline
           characters.

           See section <i>NOTES ON PASSPHRASE PROCESSING</i> in <a href="cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a>
           for more information.

       <b>--keyfile-offset </b><i>value</i>
           Skip <i>value</i> bytes at the beginning of the key file.

       <b>--keyfile-size, -l </b><i>value</i>
           Read a maximum of <i>value</i> bytes from the key file. The default
           is to read the whole file up to the compiled-in maximum that
           can be queried with --help. Supplying more data than the
           compiled-in maximum aborts the operation.

           This option is useful to cut trailing newlines, for example.
           If --keyfile-offset is also given, the size count starts
           after the offset.

       <b>--key-slot, -S &lt;0-N&gt;</b>
           For LUKS operations that add key material, this option allows
           you to specify which key slot is selected for the new key.

           The maximum number of key slots depends on the LUKS version.
           LUKS1 can have up to 8 key slots. LUKS2 can have up to 32 key
           slots based on key slot area size and key size, but a valid
           key slot ID can always be between 0 and 31 for LUKS2.

       <b>--size, -b &lt;number of 512 byte sectors&gt;</b>
           Set the size of the device in sectors of 512 bytes.

       <b>--timeout, -t &lt;number of seconds&gt;</b>
           The number of seconds to wait before timeout on passphrase
           input via terminal. It is relevant every time a passphrase is
           asked. It has no effect if used in conjunction with
           --key-file.

           This option is useful when the system should not stall if the
           user does not input a passphrase, e.g. during boot. The
           default is a value of 0 seconds, which means to wait forever.

       <b>--token-id</b>
           Specify what token to use and allow token PIN prompt to take
           precedence over interactive keyslot passphrase prompt. If
           omitted, all available tokens (not protected by PIN) will be
           checked before proceeding further with passphrase prompt.

       <b>--token-only</b>
           Do not proceed further with action if token based keyslot
           unlock failed. Without the option, action asks for passphrase
           to proceed further.

           It allows LUKS2 tokens protected by PIN to take precedence
           over interactive keyslot passphrase prompt.

       <b>--token-type </b><i>type</i>
           Restrict tokens eligible for operation to specific token
           <i>type</i>. Mostly useful when no --token-id is specified.

           It allows LUKS2 <i>type</i> tokens protected by PIN to take
           precedence over interactive keyslot passphrase prompt.

       <b>--usage</b>
           Show short option help.

       <b>--verify-passphrase, -y</b>
           When interactively asking for a passphrase, ask for it twice
           and complain if both inputs do not match. Ignored on input
           from file or stdin.

       <b>--version, -V</b>
           Show the program version.
