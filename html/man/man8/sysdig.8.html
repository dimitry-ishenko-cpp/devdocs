   <b>NAME</b>
       sysdig - the definitive system and process troubleshooting tool

   <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>sysdig </b>[<i>option</i>]...  [<i>filter</i>]

   <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>Note: if you are interested in an easier to use interface for the</b>
       <b>sysdig functionality, use the csysdig command line utility.</b>

       sysdig is a tool for system troubleshooting, analysis and explo‐
       ration.  It can be used to capture, filter and decode system
       calls and other OS events.  sysdig can be both used to inspect
       live systems, or to generate trace files that can be analyzed at
       a later stage.

       sysdig includes a powerful filtering language, has customizable
       output, and can be extended through Lua scripts, called chisels.

       <b>Output format</b>

       By default, sysdig prints the information for each captured event
       on a single line, with the following format:

       <b>*%evt.num %evt.time %evt.cpu %proc.name (%thread.tid) %evt.dir</b>
       <b>%evt.type %evt.info</b>

       where:

       • evt.num is the incremental event number

       • evt.time is the event timestamp

       • evt.cpu is the CPU number where the event was captured

       • proc.name is the name of the process that generated the event

       • thread.tid id the TID that generated the event, which corre‐
         sponds to the PID for single thread processes

       • evt.dir is the event direction, &gt; for enter events and &lt; for
         exit events

       • evt.type is the name of the event, e.g.  'open' or 'read'

       • evt.args is the list of event arguments.

       The output format can be customized with the -p switch, using any
       of the fields listed by 'sysdig -l'.

       Using -pc or -pcontainer, the default format will be changed to a
       container-friendly one:

       <b>*%evt.num %evt.time %evt.cpu %container.name (%container.id)</b>
       <b>%proc.name (%thread.tid:%thread.vtid) %evt.dir %evt.type %evt.in‐</b>
       <b>fo</b>

       <b>Trace Files</b>

       A trace file can be created using the -w switch:

              $ sysdig -w trace.scap

       The -s switch can be used to specify how many bytes of each data
       buffer should be saved to disk.  And filters can be used to save
       only certain events to disk:

              $ sysdig -s 2000 -w trace.scap proc.name=cat

       Trace files can be read this using the -r switch:

              $ sysdig -r trace.scap

       <b>Filtering</b>

       sysdig filters are specified at the end of the command line.  The
       simplest filter is a basic field-value check:

              $ sysdig proc.name=cat

       The list of available fields can be obtained with 'sysdig -l'.
       Filter expressions can use one of these comparison operators: <i>=</i>,
       <i>!=</i>, <i>&lt;</i>, <i>&lt;=</i>, <i>&gt;</i>, <i>&gt;=</i>, <i>contains</i>, <i>icontains</i>, <i>in</i> and <i>exists</i>.  e.g.

              $ sysdig fd.name contains /etc $ sysdig "evt.type in (
              'select', 'poll' )" $ sysdig proc.name exists

       Multiple checks can be combined through brackets and the follow‐
       ing boolean operators: <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>not</i>.  e.g.

              $ sysdig "not (fd.name contains /proc or fd.name contains
              /dev)"

       <b>Chisels</b>

       sysdig's chisels are little scripts that analyze the sysdig event
       stream to perform useful actions.  To get the list of available
       chisels, type

              $ sysdig -cl

       To get details about a specific chisel, type

              $ sysdig -i spy_ip

       To run one of the chisels, you use the -c flag, e.g.

              $ sysdig -c topfiles_bytes

       If a chisel needs arguments, you specify them after the chisel
       name:

              $ sysdig -c spy_ip 192.168.1.157

       If a chisel has more than one argument, specify them after the
       chisel name, enclosed in quotes:

              $ sysdig -c chisel_name "arg1 arg2 arg3"

       Chisels can be combined with filters:

              $ sysdig -c topfiles_bytes "not fd.name contains /dev"

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--print-ascii </b>Only print the text portion of data buffers,
       and echo end-of-lines.  This is useful to only display human-
       readable data.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--print-base64 </b>Print data buffers in base64.  This is useful
       for encoding binary data that needs to be used over media de‐
       signed to handle textual data (i.e., terminal or json).

       <b>-c </b><i>chiselname chiselargs</i>, <b>--chisel</b>=<i>chiselname chiselargs</i> run the
       specified chisel.  If the chisel require arguments, they must be
       specified in the command line after the name.

       <b>-C </b><i>filesize</i> Break a capture into separate files, and limit the
       size of each file based on the specified number of megabytes.
       The units of <i>filesize</i> are millions of bytes (10^6, not 2^20).
       Use in conjunction with <b>-W </b>to enable automatic file rotation.
       Otherwise, new files will continue to be created until the cap‐
       ture is manually stopped.

       Files will have the name specified by <b>-w </b>with a counter added
       starting at 0.

       <b>-cl</b>, <b>--list-chisels </b>lists the available chisels.  Sysdig looks
       for chisels in the following directories: ./chisels, ~/.chisels
       and /usr/share/sysdig/chisels.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--displayflt </b>Make the given filter a display one.  Setting
       this option causes the events to be filtered after being parsed
       by the state system.  Events are normally filtered before being
       analyzed, which is more efficient, but can cause state (e.g.  FD
       names) to be lost.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--debug </b>Capture events about sysdig itself, display internal
       events in addition to system events, and print additional logging
       on standard error.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--exclude-users </b>Don't create the user/group tables by query‐
       ing the OS when sysdig starts.  This also means that no user or
       group info will be written to the tracefile by the <b>-w </b>flag.  The
       user/group tables are necessary to use filter fields like
       user.name or group.name.  However, creating them can increase
       sysdig's startup time.  Moreover, they contain information that
       could be privacy sensitive.

       <b>-e </b><i>numevents</i> Break a capture into separate files, and limit the
       size of each file based on the specified number of events.  Use
       in conjunction with <b>-W </b>to enable automatic file rotation.  Other‐
       wise, new files will continue to be created until the capture is
       manually stopped.

       Files will have the name specified by <b>-w </b>with a counter added
       starting at 0.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fatfile </b>Enable fatfile mode.  When writing in fatfile mode,
       the output file will contain events that will be invisible when
       reading the file, but that are necessary to fully reconstruct the
       state.  Fatfile mode is useful when saving events to disk with an
       aggressive filter.  The filter could drop events that would cause
       the state to be updated (e.g.  clone() or open()).  With fatfile
       mode, those events are still saved to file, but 'hidden' so that
       they won't appear when reading the file.  Be aware that using
       this flag might generate substantially bigger traces files.

       <b>--filter-proclist </b>apply the filter to the process table.  A full
       dump of /proc is typically included in any trace file to make
       sure all the state required to decode events is in the file.
       This could cause the file to contain unwanted or sensitive infor‐
       mation.  Using this flag causes the command line filter to be ap‐
       plied to the /proc dump as well.

       <b>-G </b><i>numseconds</i> Break a capture into separate files, and limit the
       size of each file based on the specified number of seconds.  Use
       in conjunction with <b>-W </b>to enable automatic file rotation.  Other‐
       wise, new files will continue to be created until the capture is
       manually stopped.

       Files will have the name specified by <b>-w </b>which should include a
       time format as defined by strftime(3).  If no time format is
       specified, a counter will be used.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help </b>Print this page

       <b>-H </b><i>pluginname</i>[:<i>initconfig</i>], <b>--plugin </b><i>pluginname</i>[:<i>initconfig</i>] Reg‐
       isters a plugin, using the passed init config if present.  A path
       can also be used as pluginname.  The format of initconf is con‐
       trolled by the plugin, refer to each plugin's documentation to
       learn about it.

       <b>-I </b><i>pluginname</i>[:<i>openparams</i>], <b>--input </b><i>pluginname</i>[:<i>openparams</i>] Cap‐
       ture events using the plugin with name pluginname, passing to the
       plugin the openparams string as parameters.  The format of in‐
       putargs is controller by the plugin, refer to each plugin's docu‐
       mentation to learn about it.  The event sources available for
       capture vary depending on which plugins have been installed.  You
       can list the plugins that have been loaded by using the -Il flag.

       <b>-Il</b>, <b>--list-inputs </b>List the loaded plugins.  Sysdig looks for
       plugins in the following directories: ./plugins, ~/.plugins,
       /usr/share/sysdig/plugins.

       <b>--plugin-config-file </b>Load the plugin configuration from a Falco-
       compatible yaml config file.  Mixing this option with '-H' or
       '-I' is unsupported.  See the plugin section in &lt;https://fal‐
       co.org/docs/configuration/&gt; for additional informations.

       <b>-i <i>chiselname</i></b>, <b>--chisel-info=</b>_chiselname_ Get a longer descrip‐
       tion and the arguments associated with a chisel found in the -cl
       option list.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--json </b>Emit output as json, data buffer encoding will depend
       from the print format selected.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--k8s-api </b>Enable Kubernetes support by connecting to the API
       server specified as argument.  E.g.  "&lt;http://admin:pass‐
       word@127.0.0.1:8080&gt;".  The API server can also be specified via
       the environment variable SYSDIG_K8S_API.

       <b>-K </b><i>btfile | certfile:keyfile[#password][:cacertfile]</i>, <b>--k8s-api-</b>
       <b>cert=</b>_btfile | certfile:keyfile[#password][:cacertfile]_ Use the
       provided files names to authenticate user and (optionally) verify
       the K8S API server identity.  Each entry must specify full (ab‐
       solute, or relative to the current directory) path to the respec‐
       tive file.  Private key password is optional (needed only if key
       is password protected).  CA certificate is optional.  For all
       files, only PEM file format is supported.  Specifying CA certifi‐
       cate only is obsoleted - when single entry is provided for this
       option, it will be interpreted as the name of a file containing
       bearer token.  Note that the format of this command-line option
       prohibits use of files whose names contain ':' or '#' characters
       in the file name.  Option can also be provided via the environ‐
       ment variable SYSDIG_K8S_API_CERT.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--list-events </b>List the events that the engine supports

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list </b>List the fields that can be used for filtering and
       output formatting.  Use -lv to get additional information for
       each field.

       <b>--list-markdown </b>Like -l, but produces markdown output

       <b>-m </b><i>url[,marathon-url]</i>, <b>--mesos-api=</b>_url[,marathon-url]_ Enable
       Mesos support by connecting to the API server specified as argu‐
       ment (e.g.  &lt;http://admin:password@127.0.0.1:5050&gt;).  Mesos url
       is required.  Marathon url is optional, defaulting to auto-follow
       - if Marathon API server is not provided, sysdig will attempt to
       retrieve (and subsequently follow, if it migrates) the location
       of Marathon API server from the Mesos master.  Note that, with
       auto-follow, sysdig will likely receive a cluster internal IP ad‐
       dress for Marathon API server, so running sysdig with Marathon
       auto-follow from a node that is not part of Mesos cluster may not
       work.  Additionally, running sysdig with Mesos support on a node
       that has no containers managed by Mesos is of limited use be‐
       cause, although cluster metadata will be collected, there will be
       no Mesos/Marathon filtering capability.  The API servers can also
       be specified via the environment variable SYSDIG_MESOS_API.

       <b>-M </b><i>num_seconds</i> Stop collecting after reaching

       <b>-n </b><i>num</i>, <b>--numevents</b>=<i>num</i>
       Stop capturing after <i>num</i> events

       <b>--page-faults </b>Capture user/kernel major/minor page faults

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--progress</b>
       Print progress on stderr while processing trace files.

       <b>-p </b><i>outputformat</i>, <b>--print</b>=<i>outputformat</i>
       Specify the format to be used when printing the events.  With -pc
       or -pcontainer will use a container-friendly format.  With -pk or
       -pkubernetes will use a kubernetes-friendly format.  With -pm or
       -pmesos will use a mesos-friendly format.  Specifying <b>-pp </b>on the
       command line will cause sysdig to print the default command line
       format and exit.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
       Don't print events on the screen.  Useful when dumping to disk.

       <b>-r </b><i>readfile</i>, <b>--read</b>=<i>readfile</i>
       Read the events from <i>readfile</i>.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--resolve-ports </b>Resolve port numbers to names.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--summary</b>
       print the event summary (i.e.  the list of the top events) when
       the capture ends.

       <b>-s </b><i>len</i>, <b>--snaplen</b>=<i>len</i>
       Capture the first <i>len</i> bytes of each I/O buffer.  By default, the
       first 80 bytes are captured.  Use this option with caution, it
       can generate huge trace files.

       <b>-t </b><i>timetype</i>, <b>--timetype</b>=<i>timetype</i>
       Change the way event time is displayed.  Accepted values are <b>h</b>
       for human-readable string, <b>a </b>for absolute timestamp from epoch, <b>r</b>
       for relative time from the first displayed event, <b>d </b>for delta be‐
       tween event enter and exit, and <b>D </b>for delta from the previous
       event.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--force-tracers-capture</b>
       Tell the driver to make sure full buffers are captured from
       /dev/null, to make sure that tracers are completely captured.
       Note that sysdig will enable extended /dev/null capture by itself
       after detecting that tracers are written there, but that could
       result in the truncation of some tracers at the beginning of the
       capture.  This option allows preventing that.

       <b>--unbuffered</b>
       Turn off output buffering.  This causes every single line emitted
       by sysdig to be flushed, which generates higher CPU usage but is
       useful when piping sysdig's output into another process or into a
       script.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
       Verbose output.  This flag will cause the full content of text
       and binary buffers to be printed on screen, instead of being
       truncated to 40 characters.  Note that data buffers length is
       still limited by the snaplen (refer to the -s flag documentation)
       -v will also make sysdig print some summary information at the
       end of the capture.

       <b>--version</b>
       Print version number.

       <b>-w </b><i>writefile</i>, <b>--write</b>=<i>writefile</i>
       Write the captured events to <i>writefile</i>.

       <b>-W </b><i>num</i>
       Turn on file rotation for continuous capture, and limit the num‐
       ber of files created to the specified number.  Once the cap is
       reached, older files will be overwritten (ring buffer).  Use in
       conjunction with the <b>-C </b>/ <b>-G </b>/ <b>-e </b>options to limit the size of
       each file based on number of megabytes, seconds, and/or events
       (respectively).

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--print-hex</b>
       Print data buffers in hex.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--print-hex-ascii</b>
       Print data buffers in hex and ASCII.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--compress</b>
       Used with <b>-w</b>, enables compression for tracefiles.

   <b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Capture all the events from the live system and print them to
       screen

              $ sysdig

       Capture all the events from the live system and save them to disk

              $ sysdig -w dumpfile.scap

       Capture all the events in the latest 24 hours and save them to
       disk organized in files containing 1 hour of system activity each

              $ sysdig -G 3600 -W 24 -w dumpfile.scap

       Read events from a file and print them to screen

              $ sysdig -r dumpfile.scap

              cleandump.scap

       Print all the open system calls invoked by cat

              $ sysdig proc.name=cat and evt.type=open

       Print the name of the files opened by cat

              $ sysdig -p"%evt.arg.name" proc.name=cat and evt.type=open

       List the available chisels

              $ sysdig -cl

   <b>BUGS</b>
       • sysdig and its chisels are designed to be used with LuaJIT in
         Lua 5.1 mode.  While it is possible to use sysdig with LuaJIT
         in Lua 5.2 mode or regular Lua, some chisels may not work as
         expected.
