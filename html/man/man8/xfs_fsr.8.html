DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>xfs_fsr</i> is applicable only to XFS filesystems.

       <i>xfs_fsr</i> improves the organization of mounted filesystems.  The
       reorganization algorithm operates on one file at a time,
       compacting or otherwise improving the layout of the file extents
       (contiguous blocks of file data).

       The following options are accepted by <i>xfs_fsr</i>.  The <b>-m</b>, <b>-t</b>, and
       <b>-f </b>options have no meaning if any filesystems or files are
       specified on the command line.

       <b>-m </b><i>mtab</i>
              Use this file for the list of filesystems to reorganize.
              The default is to use <i>/etc/mtab</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>seconds</i>
              How long to reorganize.  The default is 7200 seconds (2
              hours).

       <b>-p </b><i>passes</i>
              Number of passes before terminating global re-org.  The
              default is 10 passes.

       <b>-f </b><i>leftoff</i>
              Use this file instead of <i>/var/tmp/.fsrlast</i> to read the
              state of where to start and as the file to store the state
              of where reorganization left off.

       <b>-v     </b>Verbose.  Print cryptic information about each file being
              reorganized.

       <b>-d     </b>Debug.  Print even more cryptic information.

       <b>-g     </b>Print to syslog (default if stdout not a tty).

       <b>-V     </b>Prints the version number and exits.

       When invoked with no arguments <i>xfs_fsr</i> reorganizes all regular
       files in all mounted filesystems.  <i>xfs_fsr</i> makes many cycles over
       <i>/etc/mtab</i> each time making a single pass over each XFS
       filesystem.  Each pass goes through and selects files that have
       the largest number of extents.  It attempts to defragment the top
       10% of these files on each pass.

       It runs for up to two hours after which it records the filesystem
       where it left off, so it can start there the next time.  This
       information is stored in the file <i>/var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs.</i>  If the
       information found here is somehow inconsistent or out of date it
       is ignored and reorganization starts at the beginning of the
       first filesystem found in <i>/etc/mtab</i>.

       <i>xfs_fsr</i> can be called with one or more arguments naming
       filesystems (block device name), and files to reorganize.  In
       this mode <i>xfs_fsr</i> does not read or write <i>/var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs</i>
       nor does it run for a fixed time interval.  It makes one pass
       through each specified regular file and all regular files in each
       specified filesystem.  A command line name referring to a
       symbolic link (except to a file system device), FIFO, or UNIX
       domain socket generates a warning message, but is otherwise
       ignored.  While traversing the filesystem these types of files
       are silently skipped.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/mtab
              contains default list of filesystems to reorganize.
       /var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs
              records the state where reorganization left off.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>xfs_fsr</i> improves the layout of extents for each file by copying
       the entire file to a temporary location and then interchanging
       the data extents of the target and temporary files in an atomic
       manner.  This method requires that enough free disk space be
       available to copy any given file and that the space be less
       fragmented than the original file.  It also requires the owner of
       the file to have enough remaining filespace quota to do the copy
       on systems running quotas.  <i>xfs_fsr</i> generates a warning message
       if space is not sufficient to improve the target file.

       A temporary file used in improving a file given on the command
       line is created in the same parent directory of the target file
       and is prefixed by the string '<b>.fsr</b>'.  The temporary files used
       in improving an entire XFS device are stored in a directory at
       the root of the target device and use the same naming scheme.
       The temporary files are unlinked upon creation so data will not
       be readable by any other process.

       <i>xfs_fsr</i> does not operate on files that are currently mapped in
       memory.  A 'file busy' error can be seen for these files if the
       verbose flag (<b>-v</b>) is set.

       Files marked as no-defrag will be skipped. The <a href="xfs_io.8.html">xfs_io(8)</a> chattr
       command with the f attribute can be used to set or clear this
       flag. Files and directories created in a directory with the
       no-defrag flag will inherit the attribute.

       An entry in <i>/etc/mtab</i> or the file specified using the <b>-m </b>option
       must have the <b>rw </b>option specified for read and write access.  If
       this option is not present, then <i>xfs_fsr</i> skips the filesystem
       described by that line.  See the <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a> reference page for more
       details.

       In general we do not foresee the need to run <i>xfs_fsr</i> on system
       partitions such as <i>/</i>, <i>/boot</i> and <i>/usr</i> as in general these will not
       suffer from fragmentation.  There are also issues with
       defragmenting files <b>lilo</b>(8) uses to boot your system. It is
       recommended that these files should be flagged as no-defrag with
       the <a href="xfs_io.8.html">xfs_io(8)</a> chattr command. Should these files be moved by
       <i>xfs_fsr</i> then you must rerun <i>lilo</i> before you reboot or you may
       have an unbootable system.
