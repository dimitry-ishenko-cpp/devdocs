NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dmfilemapd — device-mapper filemap monitoring daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dmfilemapd </b><i>file_descriptor group_id abs_path</i> <b>inode</b>|<b>path</b>
       [<i>foreground</i> [<i>verbose</i>]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The  dmfilemapd daemon monitors groups of <a href="dmstats.8.html">dmstats(8)</a> regions that
       correspond to the extents of a file, adding and removing  regions
       to reflect the changing state of the file on-disk.

       The daemon is normally launched automatically by the <b>dmstats cre‐</b>
       <b>ate </b>command, but can be run manually, either to create a new dae‐
       mon  where one did not previously exist, or to change the options
       previously used, by killing the existing daemon  and  starting  a
       new one.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>file_descriptor</i>
              Specify the file descriptor number for the file to be mon‐
              itored.  The file descriptor must reference a regular
              file, open for reading, in a local file system that sup‐
              ports the FIEMAP ioctl, and that returns data describing
              the physical location of extents.

              The process that executes <b>dmfilemapd </b>is responsible for
              opening the file descriptor that is handed to the daemon.

       <i>group_id</i>
              The <b>dmstats </b>group identifier of the group that <b>dmfilemapd</b>
              should update. The group must exist and it should corre‐
              spond to a set of regions created by a previous filemap
              operation.

       <i>abs_path</i>
              The absolute path to the file being monitored, at the time
              that it was opened. The use of <i>abs_path</i> by the daemon dif‐
              fers, depending on the filemap following mode in use; see
              <b>MODES </b>and the <i>mode</i> option for more information.

       <b>inode</b>|<b>path</b>
              The filemap monitoring mode the daemon.  Use either <b>inode</b>
              (<b>DM_FILEMAP_FOLLOW_INODE</b>), or <b>path </b>(<b>DM_FILEMAP_FOL‐</b>
              <b>LOW_PATH</b>), to enable follow-inode or follow-path mode re‐
              spectively.

       [<i>foreground</i>]
              If set to 1, disable forking and allow the daemon to run
              in the foreground.

       [<i>verbose</i>]
              Control daemon logging. If set to zero, the daemon will
              close all stdio streams and run silently. If <b>verbose </b>is a
              number between 1 and 3, stdio will be retained and the
              daemon will log messages to stdout and stderr that match
              the specified verbosity level.
</pre> <h2>
MODES </h2>
<pre>
       The file map monitoring daemon can monitor files in two distinct
       ways: the mode affects the behaviour of the daemon when a file
       under monitoring is renamed or unlinked, and the conditions which
       cause the daemon to terminate.

       In both modes, the daemon will always shut down when the group
       being monitored is deleted.

       <b>Follow inode</b>

       The daemon follows the inode of the file, as it was at the time
       the daemon started. The file descriptor referencing the file is
       kept open at all times, and the daemon will exit when it detects
       that the file has been unlinked and it is the last holder of a
       reference to the file.

       This mode is useful if the file is expected to be renamed, or
       moved within the file system, while it is being monitored.

       <b>Follow path</b>

       The daemon follows the path that was given on the daemon command
       line. The file descriptor referencing the file is re-opened on
       each iteration of the daemon, and the daemon will exit if no file
       exists at this location (a tolerance is allowed so that a brief
       delay between removal and replacement is permitted).

       This mode is useful if the file is updated by unlinking the orig‐
       inal and placing a new file at the same path.
</pre> <h2>
LIMITATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The daemon attempts to maintain good synchronisation between the
       file extents and the regions contained in the group, however,
       since the daemon can only react to new allocations once they have
       been written, there are inevitably some IO events that cannot be
       counted when a file is growing, particularly if the file is being
       extended by a single thread writing beyond EOF (for example, the
       <b>dd </b>program).

       There is a further loss of events in that there is currently no
       way to atomically resize a <b>dmstats </b>region and preserve its cur‐
       rent counter values. This affects files when they grow by extend‐
       ing the final extent, rather than allocating a new extent: any
       events that had accumulated in the region between any prior oper‐
       ation and the resize are lost.

       File mapping is currently most effective in cases where the ma‐
       jority of IO does not trigger extent allocation. Future updates
       may address these limitations when kernel support is available.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Normally the daemon is started automatically by the <b>dmstats cre‐</b>
       <b>ate </b>or <b>update_filemap </b>commands but it can be run manually for de‐
       bugging or testing purposes.

       Start the daemon in the background, in follow-path mode
       # <b>dmfilemapd 3 0 /srv/images/vm.img path 0 0 3&lt; /srv/im‐</b>
       <b>ages/vm.img</b>

       Start the daemon in follow-inode mode, disable forking and enable
       verbose logging
       # <b>dmfilemapd 3 0 /var/tmp/data inode 1 3 3&lt; /var/tmp/data</b>
       Starting dmfilemapd with fd=3, group_id=0 mode=inode, path=/var/tmp/data
       dm version   [ opencount flush ]   [16384] (*1)
       dm info   (253:0) [ opencount flush ]   [16384] (*1)

       Read alias 'data' from aux_data
