NAME </h2>
<pre>
       key.dns_resolver - upcall for request-key to handle dns_resolver
       keys
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/sbin/key.dns_resolver </b>&lt;key&gt;
       <b>/sbin/key.dns_resolver </b>--dump-config [-c &lt;configfile&gt;]
       <b>/sbin/key.dns_resolver </b>-D [-v] [-v] [-c &lt;configfile&gt;] &lt;desc&gt;
       &lt;calloutinfo&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This program is invoked by request-key on behalf of the kernel
       when kernel services (such as NFS, CIFS and AFS) want to perform
       a hostname lookup and the kernel does not have the key cached.
       It is not ordinarily intended to be called directly.

       There program has internal parameters that can be changed with a
       configuration file (see key.dns_resolver.conf(5) for more
       information).  The default configuration file is in /etc, but
       this can be overridden with the <b>-c </b>flag.

       The program can be called in debugging mode to test its
       functionality by passing a <b>-D </b>or <b>--debug </b>flag on the command
       line.  For this to work, the key description and the callout
       information must be supplied.  Verbosity can be increased by
       supplying one or more <b>-v </b>flags.

       The program may also be called with <b>--dump-config </b>to show the
       values that configurable parameters will have after parsing the
       config file.
