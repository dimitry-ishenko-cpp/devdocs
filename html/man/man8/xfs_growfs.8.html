NAME </h2>
<pre>
       xfs_growfs - expand an XFS filesystem
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_growfs </b>[ <b>-dilnrx </b>] [ <b>-D </b><i>size</i> ] [ <b>-e </b><i>rtextsize</i> ] [ <b>-L </b><i>size</i> ] [
       <b>-m </b><i>maxpct</i> ] [ <b>-t </b><i>mtab</i> ] [ <b>-R </b><i>size</i> ] [ <i>mount-point</i> | <i>block-device</i>
       ]

       <b>xfs_growfs -V</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_growfs </b>expands an existing XFS filesystem (see <a href="../man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a>).  The
       <i>mount-point</i> argument is the pathname of the directory where the
       filesystem is mounted. The <i>block-device</i> argument is the device
       name of a mounted XFS filesystem.  The filesystem must be mounted
       to be grown (see <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>).  The existing contents of the
       filesystem are undisturbed, and the added space becomes available
       for additional file storage.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d | -D </b><i>size</i>
              Specifies that the data section of the filesystem should
              be resized. If the <b>-D </b><i>size</i> option is given, the data
              section is changed to that <i>size</i>, otherwise the data
              section is grown to the largest size possible with the <b>-d</b>
              option. The size is expressed in filesystem blocks. A
              filesystem with only 1 AG cannot be shrunk further, and a
              filesystem cannot be shrunk to the point where it would
              only have 1 AG.

       <b>-e     </b>Allows the real-time extent size to be specified. In
              <b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) this is specified with <b>-r extsize=</b><i>nnnn</i>.

       <b>-i     </b>The new log is an internal log (inside the data section).
              <b>[NOTE: This option is not implemented]</b>

       <b>-l | -L </b><i>size</i>
              Specifies that the log section of the filesystem should be
              grown, shrunk, or moved. If the <b>-L </b><i>size</i> option is given,
              the log section is changed to be that <i>size</i>, if possible.
              The size is expressed in filesystem blocks.  The size of
              an internal log must be smaller than the size of an
              allocation group (this value is printed at <a href="mkfs.8.html">mkfs(8)</a> time).
              If neither <b>-i </b>nor <b>-x </b>is given with <b>-l</b>, the log continues
              to be internal or external as it was before.  <b>[NOTE: These</b>
              <b>options are not implemented]</b>

       <b>-m     </b>Specify a new value for the maximum percentage of space in
              the filesystem that can be allocated as inodes. In
              <b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) this is specified with <b>-i maxpct=</b><i>nn</i>.

       <b>-n     </b>Specifies that no change to the filesystem is to be made.
              The filesystem geometry is printed, and argument checking
              is performed, but no growth occurs.  <b>See output examples</b>
              <b>below.</b>

       <b>-r | -R </b><i>size</i>
              Specifies that the real-time section of the filesystem
              should be grown. If the <b>-R </b><i>size</i> option is given, the real-
              time section is grown to that size, otherwise the real-
              time section is grown to the largest size possible with
              the <b>-r </b>option. The size is expressed in filesystem blocks.
              The filesystem does not need to have contained a real-time
              section before the <b>xfs_growfs </b>operation.

       <b>-t     </b>Specifies an alternate mount table file (default is
              <i>/proc/mounts</i> if it exists, else <i>/etc/mtab</i>).  This is used
              when working with filesystems mounted without writing to
              <i>/etc/mtab</i> file - refer to <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> for further details.

       <b>-V     </b>Prints the version number and exits. The <i>mount-point</i>
              argument is not required with <b>-V</b>.

       <b>xfs_growfs </b>is most often used in conjunction with logical volumes
       (see <a href="../man4/md.4.html">md(4)</a> and <a href="lvm.8.html">lvm(8)</a> on Linux).  However, it can also be used on
       a regular disk partition, for example if a partition has been
       enlarged while retaining the same starting block.
</pre> <h2>
PRACTICAL USE </h2>
<pre>
       Filesystems normally occupy all of the space on the device where
       they reside. In order to grow a filesystem, it is necessary to
       provide added space for it to occupy. Therefore there must be at
       least one spare new disk partition available. Adding the space is
       often done through the use of a logical volume manager.
