NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stap-exporter - systemtap-prometheus interoperation mechanism
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>stap-exporter </b>[ <i>OPTIONS</i> ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stap-exporter</i> runs a set of systemtap scripts and relays their
       procfs outputs to remote HTTP clients on demand.  This makes
       systemtap scripts directly usable as individual prometheus
       exporters.  This is assisted by a set of macros provided in the
       <b>prometheus.stpm </b>tapset file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>stap-exporter</i> program supports the following options.

       <b>-p --port PORT</b>
              Listen to the specified TCP port for HTTP requests. Port
              9900 is used by default.

       <b>-k --keepalive KEEPALIVE</b>
              Scripts that run longer than KEEPALIVE seconds beyond the
              last request are shut down.  There is no timeout by
              default, so once started, scripts are kept running.

       <b>-s --scripts SCRIPTS</b>
              Search the directory SCRIPTS for <b>*.stp </b>files to be
              exposed.  The default is given in the <b>stappaths.7 </b>man
              page.

       <b>-h --help</b>
              Print help message.
</pre> <h2>
OPERATION </h2>
<pre>
       Upon startup, <i>stap-exporter</i> searches the directory specified by
       the <b>-s </b>directory for files named <b>*.stp</b>.  The name of each file
       becomes available as a URL component for subsequent GET HTTP
       requests.  For example, when an HTTP client asks for <b>/foo.stp</b>,
       and the <b>foo.stp </b>script (executable / shell-script) was known,
       then it is spawned with additional <i>stap</i> options to set a module
       name.  This predictable module name makes it possible for stap-
       exporter to transcribe a procfs file from that running script to
       HTTP clients.

       After a configurable period of disuse (<b>-k </b>or <b>--keepalive </b>option),
       a systemtap script is terminated.  It will be restarted again if
       a client requests.

       All files whose name includes the substring <b>autostart </b>are started
       immediately (and restarted if they stop), rather than on-demand.
       These are excluded from keepalive considerations.  Scripts that
       may be too slow to start or wish to report long-term statistics
       are candidates for this treatment.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       Suppose that <b>example.stp </b>contains the following script.  It
       counts read syscalls on a per-thread &amp; per-cpu basis.

              global arr%

              probe syscall.read {
                  arr[tid(), cpu()]++
              }

              probe prometheus {
                  @prometheus_dump_array2(arr, "count", "tid", "cpu")
              }

       The <i>prometheus_dump_array</i> macros are used to produce metrics from
       an array.  Systemtap provides a <i>prometheus_dump_arrayN</i> macro for
       all N from 1 to 8.  The first argument of the macros represents
       an array with N-element keys.  The second argument represents the
       name of the metric. The remaining N arguments represent the names
       of the metric's labels.

       One may launch stap-exporter as root, or equivalent <i>stapdev</i> priv‐
       ileges, then after a brief delay, use any web client to fetch da‐
       ta:

              # stap-exporter -p 9999 -k 60 -c . &amp;

              $ curl <a href="http://localhost:9999/example.stp">http://localhost:9999/example.stp</a>
              Refresh page to access metrics.  [...]

              $ curl <a href="http://localhost:9999/example.stp">http://localhost:9999/example.stp</a>
              count{tid="12614",cpu="0"} 9
              count{tid="12170",cpu="3"} 107
              count{tid="1802",cpu="0"} 33687
              count{tid="12617",cpu="1"} 99
              [...]

       The same URL may be added to a Prometheus server's scrape_config
       section, or a Performance Co-Pilot pmdaprometheus config.d direc‐
       tory, to collect this data into a monitoring system.
</pre> <h2>
SAFETY AND SECURITY </h2>
<pre>
       The stap-exporter server does not enforce any particular security
       mechanisms.  Therefore, deployment in an untrusted environment
       needs to consider:

       script selection
              Since systemtap scripts are run under the privileges of
              the stap-exporter process (probably <i>root</i>), the system ad‐
              ministrator must select only safe &amp; robust scripts.  Check
              the scripts installed by default before activating the
              service.  Scripts cannot take input from the web clients.

       TCP/IP firewalling
              Since stap-exporter exposes the selected TCP/HTTP port to
              all interfaces on the host, it may be necessary to add a
              firewall.  It is unlikely to be appropriate to expose such
              a service to an untrusted network.

       HTTP filtering
              Since stap-exporter exposes the configured systemtap
              scripts to all HTTP clients without authentication, it may
              be necessary to protect it from abuse even on mostly
              trusted networks.  An HTTP proxy may be used to impose
              URL- or client- or usage- or authentication-dependent fil‐
              ters.

       HTTPS  Since stap-exporter speaks only plain HTTP, an HTTP proxy
              may be used to support HTTPS secure protocols.
