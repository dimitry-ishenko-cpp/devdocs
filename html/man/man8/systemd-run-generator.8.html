NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-run-generator - Generator for invoking commands specified
       on the kernel command line as system service
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-run-generator
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-run-generator is a generator that reads the kernel
       command line and understands three options:

       If the <b>systemd.run= </b>option is specified and followed by a command
       line, a unit named kernel-command-line.service is generated for
       it and booted into. The service has <i>Type=oneshot</i> set, and has
       <i>SuccessAction=exit</i> and <i>FailureAction=exit</i> configured by default,
       thus ensuring that the system is shut down as soon as the command
       completes. The exit status of the command line is propagated to
       the invoking container manager, if this applies (which might
       propagate this further, to the calling shell — e.g.
       <b>systemd-nspawn</b>(7) does this). If this option is used multiple
       times the unit file will contain multiple <i>ExecStart=</i> lines, to
       execute all commands in order. The command is started as regular
       service, i.e. with <i>DefaultDependencies=</i> on.

       Use <b>systemd.run_success_action= </b>and <b>systemd.run_failure_action=</b>
       to tweak how to react to the process completing. In particular
       assigning "none" will leave the system running after the command
       completes. For further details on supported arguments, see
       <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>.

       systemd-run-generator implements <a href="../man7/systemd.generator.7.html">systemd.generator(7)</a>.

EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       Use a command like the following to add a user to the user
       database inside a container run with <b>systemd-nspawn</b>(7):

           # systemd-nspawn -D mycontainer -b systemd.run='"adduser test"'

       (Note the requirement for double quoting in the command line
       above. The first level of quoting ('') is processed and removed
       by the command shell used to invoke <b>systemd-nspawn</b>. The second
       level of quoting ("") is propagated to the kernel command line of
       the container and processed and removed by <b>systemd-run-generator</b>.
       Both together make sure both words of the specified command line
       <b>adduser test </b>end up in the generated unit file together and are
       neither split apart by the command shell nor by the generator.)
