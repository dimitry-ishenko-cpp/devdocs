NAME </h2>
<pre>
       e2mmpstatus - Check MMP status of an ext4 file system
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>e2mmpstatus </b>[<b>-i</b>] &lt;<i>file</i>system<i>&gt;</i>
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-i     </b>prints out the MMP information rather than check it.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>e2mmpstatus </b>is used to check Multiple-Mount Protection (MMP)
       status of an ext4 file system with the <b>mmp </b>feature enabled.  The
       specified <i>file system</i> can be a device name (e.g.  <i>/dev/hdc1</i>,
       <i>/dev/sdb2</i>), or an ext4 file system label or UUID, for example
       <b>UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd </b>or <b>LABEL=root</b>.  By
       default, the <b>e2mmpstatus </b>program checks whether it is safe to
       mount the file system without taking the risk of mounting it more
       than once.

       MMP (multiple-mount protection) is a feature that adds protection
       against the file system being modified simultaneously by more
       than one node.  It is NOT safe to mount a file system when one of
       the following conditions is true:
            1. e2fsck is running on the file system.
            2. the file system is in use by another node.
            3. The MMP block is corrupted or cannot be read for some
       reason.
       The <b>e2mmpstatus </b>program might wait for some time to see whether
       the MMP block is being updated by any node during this period.
       The time taken depends on how frequently the MMP block is being
       written by the other node.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT CODE </h2>
<pre>
       The exit code returned by <b>e2mmpstatus </b>is 0 when it is safe to
       mount the file system, 1 when the MMP block shows the file system
       is in use on another node and it is NOT safe to mount the file
       system, and 2 if some other failure occurred that prevents the
       check from properly detecting the current MMP status.
