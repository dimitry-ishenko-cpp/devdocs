NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pwhistory_helper - Helper binary that transfers password hashes
       from passwd or shadow to opasswd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pwhistory_helper </b>[...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>pwhistory_helper</i> is a helper program for the <i>pam_pwhistory</i> module
       that transfers password hashes from passwd or shadow file to the
       opasswd file and checks a password supplied by user against the
       existing hashes in the opasswd file.

       The purpose of the helper is to enable tighter confinement of
       login and password changing services. The helper is thus called
       only when SELinux is enabled on the system.

       The interface of the helper - command line options, and
       input/output data format are internal to the <i>pam_pwhistory</i> module
       and it should not be called directly from applications.
