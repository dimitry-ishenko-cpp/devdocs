</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="pkgtorrent-service.8.html">pkgtorrent-service(8)</a> Is a python WSGI web application that can
       generate BitTorrent files for binary files available from the web
       server.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       The program should installed on a site local <b>yum </b>mirror and must
       be configured before use. See <a href="../man5/pkgtorrent-service.conf.5.html">pkgtorrent-service.conf(5)</a> for more
       information.
</pre> <h2>
USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The primary use case for this service is implemented in
       <a href="../man1/yum-torrent.1.html">yum-torrent(1)</a>.

       There is a secondary interface to assist with simple file
       downloads involving a single path.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
              $ curl <a href="#">http://example.com/<b>path/to/large/file </b>&gt; <b>file</b></a>

       can be converted to using BitTorrent with:

              $ curl <a href="#">http://example.com/<b>path</b>/torrent_service/single/<b>path/to/large/file </b>&gt; <b>file</b>.torrent</a>
              $ btclient <b>file</b>.torrent

       Note the repetition of <b>path </b>before the service name, and the
       addition of <b>torrent_service/single </b>to pass control to the single
       path mode.  Simple file mode supports simple globbing, so you can
       specify ...<b>/directory/*.foo</b>.  If the path resolves to only one
       file, the multi-file support in the .torrent file is skipped,
       making the downloaded file easier to handle.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /var/lib/torrent_service/trackers
              The service needs to include one or more BitTorrent
              tracker servers.  The format is one "announce" URL per
              line. Example: <b>http://example.com:6969/announce </b>This text
              file is scanned each minute for updates.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The service makes extensive use of cache files. The files are
       relatively small. It is recommended you periodically clean these
       caches for files not used in the past month or so.

       /var/cache/torrent_service/info/<b>input_digest</b>
              This directory caches <i>info_hashes</i> for the previously
              requested path digests.  These are used with the current
              list of trackers to generate .torrent files in constant
              time.

       /var/cache/torrent_service/pieces/path/to/file/<i>blocksize</i>
              Every file within a torrent is represented by a list of
              SHA1 digests, one for each <i>blocksize</i> of the file.  The
              SHA1 list is expensive to generate.  The same binaries may
              be downloaded in different permutations by different
              clients.  The cache is invalidated if the original file
              has a different mtime or is a different size.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Single file mode should be called simple.
