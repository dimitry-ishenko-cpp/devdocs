       rpm-plugin-dbus-announce - DBus plugin for the RPM Package Manag‐
       er
</pre> <h2>
Description </h2>
<pre>
       The plugin writes basic information about rpm transactions to the
       system dbus - like packages installed or removed.  Other programs
       can subscribe to the signals to be notified of the packages on
       the system change.
</pre> <h2>
DBus Signals </h2>
<pre>
       Sends <b>StartTransaction </b>and <b>EndTransaction </b>messages from the
       <b>/org/rpm/Transaction </b>object with the <b>org.rpm.Transaction </b>inter‐
       face.

       The signal passes the DB cookie as a string and the transaction
       id as an unsigned 32 bit integer.
