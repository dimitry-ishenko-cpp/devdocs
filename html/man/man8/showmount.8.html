</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       showmount - show mount information for an NFS server
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>showmount [ -adehv ] [ --all ] [ --directories ] [ --exports ]</b>
       <b>[ --help ] [ --version ] [ host ]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>showmount </b>queries the mount daemon on a remote host for
       information about the state of the NFS server on that machine.
       With no options <b>showmount </b>lists the set of clients who are
       mounting from that host.  The output from <b>showmount </b>is designed
       to appear as though it were processed through ``sort -u''.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a </b>or <b>--all</b>
              List both the client hostname or IP address and mounted
              directory in host:dir format. This info should not be
              considered reliable. See the notes on rmtab in
              <a href="rpc.mountd.8.html">rpc.mountd(8)</a>.

       <b>-d </b>or <b>--directories</b>
              List only the directories mounted by some client.

       <b>-e </b>or <b>--exports</b>
              Show the NFS server's export list.

       <b>-h </b>or <b>--help</b>
              Provide a short help summary.

       <b>-v </b>or <b>--version</b>
              Report the current version number of the program.

       <b>--no-headers</b>
              Suppress the descriptive headings from the output.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The completeness and accuracy of the information that <b>showmount</b>
       displays varies according to the NFS server's implementation.

       Because <b>showmount </b>sorts and uniqs the output, it is impossible to
       determine from the output whether a client is mounting the same
       directory more than once.

       <b>showmount </b>works by contacting the server's MNT service directly.
       NFSv4-only servers have no need to advertise their exported root
       filehandles via this method, and may not expose their MNT service
       to clients.
