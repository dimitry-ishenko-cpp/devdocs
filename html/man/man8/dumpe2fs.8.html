</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dumpe2fs - dump ext2/ext3/ext4 file system information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dumpe2fs </b>[ <b>-bfghixV </b>] [ <b>-o superblock=</b><i>superblock</i> ] [ <b>-o</b>
       <b>blocksize=</b><i>blocksize</i> ] <i>device</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dumpe2fs </b>prints the super block and blocks group information for
       the file system present on <i>device.</i>

       <b>Note: </b>When used with a mounted file system, the printed
       information may be old or inconsistent.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-b     </b>print the blocks which are reserved as bad in the file
              system.

       <b>-o superblock=</b><i>superblock</i>
              use the block <i>superblock</i> when examining the file system.
              This option is not usually needed except by a file system
              wizard who is examining the remains of a very badly
              corrupted file system.

       <b>-o blocksize=</b><i>blocksize</i>
              use blocks of <i>blocksize</i> bytes when examining the file
              system.  This option is not usually needed except by a
              file system wizard who is examining the remains of a very
              badly corrupted file system.

       <b>-f     </b>force dumpe2fs to display a file system even though it may
              have some file system feature flags which dumpe2fs may not
              understand (and which can cause some of dumpe2fs's display
              to be suspect).

       <b>-g     </b>display the group descriptor information in a machine
              readable colon-separated value format.  The fields
              displayed are the group number; the number of the first
              block in the group; the superblock location (or -1 if not
              present); the range of blocks used by the group
              descriptors (or -1 if not present); the block bitmap
              location; the inode bitmap location; and the range of
              blocks used by the inode table.

       <b>-h     </b>only display the superblock information and not any of the
              block group descriptor detail information.

       <b>-i     </b>display the file system data from an image file created by
              <b>e2image</b>, using <i>device</i> as the pathname to the image file.

       <b>-m     </b>If the <b>mmp </b>feature is enabled on the file system, check if
              <i>device</i> is in use by another node, see <a href="e2mmpstatus.8.html">e2mmpstatus(8)</a> for
              full details.  If used together with the <b>-i </b>option, only
              the MMP block information is printed.

       <b>-x     </b>print the detailed group information block numbers in
              hexadecimal format

       <b>-V     </b>print the version number of <b>dumpe2fs </b>and exit.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT CODE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dumpe2fs </b>exits with a return code of 0 if the operation completed
       without errors.  It will exit with a non-zero return code if
       there are any errors, such as problems reading a valid
       superblock, bad checksums, or if the device is in use by another
       node and <b>-m </b>is specified.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       You may need to know the physical file system structure to
       understand the output.
