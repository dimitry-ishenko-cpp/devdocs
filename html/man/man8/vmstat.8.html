NAME </h2>
<pre>
       vmstat - Report virtual memory statistics
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>vmstat </b>[<i>option</i> ...] [<i>delay</i> [<i>count</i>]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>vmstat </b>reports information about processes, memory, paging, block
       IO, traps, disks and cpu activity.

       The first report produced gives averages since the last reboot.
       Additional reports give information on a sampling period of
       length <i>delay</i>.  The process and memory reports are instantaneous
       in either case.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>delay</i>  The <i>delay</i> between updates in seconds.  If no <i>delay</i> is
              specified, only one report is printed with the average
              values since boot.

       <i>count</i>  Number of updates.  In absence of <i>count</i>, when <i>delay</i> is
              defined, default is infinite.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--active</b>
              Display active and  inactive memory, given a 2.5.41 kernel
              or better.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--forks</b>
              The <b>-f </b>switch displays the number of forks since boot.
              This includes the fork, vfork, and clone system calls, and
              is equivalent to the total number of tasks created.  Each
              process is represented by one or more tasks, depending on
              thread usage.  This display does not repeat.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--slabs</b>
              Displays slabinfo.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--one-header</b>
              Display the header only once rather than periodically.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stats</b>
              Displays a table of various event counters and memory
              statistics.  This display does not repeat.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--disk</b>
              Report disk statistics (2.5.70 or above required).

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--disk-sum</b>
              Report some summary statistics about disk activity.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--partition </b><i>device</i>
              Detailed statistics about partition (2.5.70 or above
              required).

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--unit </b><i>character</i>
              Switches outputs between 1000 (<i>k</i>), 1024 (<i>K</i>), 1000000 (<i>m</i>),
              or 1048576 (<i>M</i>) bytes.  Note this does not change the swap
              (si/so) or block (bi/bo) fields.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timestamp</b>
              Append timestamp to each line

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wide</b>
              Wide output mode (useful for systems with higher amount of
              memory, where the default output mode suffers from
              unwanted column breakage).  The output is wider than 80
              characters per line.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--no-first</b>
              Omits first report with statistics since system boot.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display help and exit.

NOTES </h2>

       standard users.  Mount options for <i>/proc</i> such as <i>subset=pid</i> may
       also impact what is visible.
