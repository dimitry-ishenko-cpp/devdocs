NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_unix - Module for traditional password authentication
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_unix.so </b>[...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is the standard Unix authentication module. It uses standard
       calls from the system's libraries to retrieve and set account
       information as well as authentication. Usually this is obtained
       from the /etc/passwd and the /etc/shadow file as well if shadow
       is enabled.

       The account component performs the task of establishing the
       status of the user's account and password based on the following
       <i>shadow</i> elements: expire, last_change, max_change, min_change,
       warn_change. In the case of the latter, it may offer advice to
       the user on changing their password or, through the
       <b>PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD </b>return, delay giving service to the user until
       they have established a new password. The entries listed above
       are documented in the <a href="../man5/shadow.5.html">shadow(5)</a> manual page. Should the user's
       record not contain one or more of these entries, the
       corresponding <i>shadow</i> check is not performed.

       The authentication component performs the task of checking the
       users credentials (password). The default action of this module
       is to not permit the user access to a service if their official
       password is blank.

       A helper binary, <a href="unix_chkpwd.8.html">unix_chkpwd(8)</a>, is provided to check the user's
       password when it is stored in a read protected database. This
       binary is very simple and will only check the password of the
       user invoking it. It is called transparently on behalf of the
       user by the authenticating component of this module. In this way
       it is possible for applications like <b>xlock</b>(1) to work without
       being setuid-root. The module, by default, will temporarily turn
       off SIGCHLD handling for the duration of execution of the helper
       binary. This is generally the right thing to do, as many
       applications are not prepared to handle this signal from a child
       they didn't know was <b>fork()</b>d. The <b>noreap </b>module argument can be
       used to suppress this temporary shielding and may be needed for
       use with certain applications.

       The maximum length of a password supported by the pam_unix module
       via the helper binary is <i>PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE</i> - currently 512 bytes.
       The rest of the password provided by the conversation function to
       the module will be ignored.

       The password component of this module performs the task of
       updating the user's password. The default encryption hash is
       taken from the <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>variable from <i>/etc/login.defs</i>

       The session component of this module logs when a user logins or
       leave the system.

       Remaining arguments, supported by others functions of this
       module, are silently ignored. Other arguments are logged as
       errors through <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debug</b>
           Turns on debugging via <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.

       <b>audit</b>
           A little more extreme than debug.

       <b>quiet</b>
           Turns off informational messages namely messages about
           session open and close via <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.

       <b>nullok</b>
           The default action of this module is to not permit the user
           access to a service if their official password is blank. The
           <b>nullok </b>argument overrides this default.

       <b>nullresetok</b>
           Allow users to authenticate with blank password if password
           reset is enforced even if <b>nullok </b>is not set. If password
           reset is not required and <b>nullok </b>is not set the
           authentication with blank password will be denied.

       <b>try_first_pass</b>
           Before prompting the user for their password, the module
           first tries the previous stacked module's password in case
           that satisfies this module as well.

       <b>use_first_pass</b>
           The argument <b>use_first_pass </b>forces the module to use a
           previous stacked modules password and will never prompt the
           user - if no password is available or the password is not
           appropriate, the user will be denied access.

       <b>nodelay</b>
           This argument can be used to discourage the authentication
           component from requesting a delay should the authentication
           as a whole fail. The default action is for the module to
           request a delay-on-failure of the order of two second.

       <b>use_authtok</b>
           When password changing enforce the module to set the new
           password to the one provided by a previously stacked <b>password</b>
           module (this is used in the example of the stacking of the
           <b>pam_passwdqc </b>module documented below).

       <b>authtok_type=</b><i>type</i>
           This argument can be used to modify the password prompt when
           changing passwords to include the type of the password. Empty
           by default.

       <b>nis</b>
           NIS RPC is used for setting new passwords.

       <b>remember=</b><i>n</i>
           The last <i>n</i> passwords for each user are saved in
           /etc/security/opasswd in order to force password change
           history and keep the user from alternating between the same
           password too frequently. The MD5 password hash algorithm is
           used for storing the old passwords. Instead of this option
           the <b>pam_pwhistory </b>module should be used.

       <b>shadow</b>
           Try to maintain a shadow based system.

       <b>md5</b>
           When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the
           MD5 algorithm.

       <b>bigcrypt</b>
           When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the
           DEC C2 algorithm.

       <b>sha256</b>
           When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the
           SHA256 algorithm. The SHA256 algorithm must be supported by
           the <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a> function.

       <b>sha512</b>
           When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the
           SHA512 algorithm. The SHA512 algorithm must be supported by
           the <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a> function.

       <b>blowfish</b>
           When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the
           blowfish algorithm. The blowfish algorithm must be supported
           by the <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a> function.

       <b>gost_yescrypt</b>
           When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the
           gost-yescrypt algorithm. The gost-yescrypt algorithm must be
           supported by the <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a> function.

       <b>yescrypt</b>
           When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the
           yescrypt algorithm. The yescrypt algorithm must be supported
           by the <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a> function.

       <b>rounds=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the optional number of rounds of the SHA256, SHA512,
           blowfish, gost-yescrypt, and yescrypt password hashing
           algorithms to <i>n</i>.

       <b>broken_shadow</b>
           Ignore errors reading shadow information for users in the
           account management module.

       <b>minlen=</b><i>n</i>
           Set a minimum password length of <i>n</i> characters. The max. for
           DES crypt based passwords are 8 characters.

       <b>no_pass_expiry</b>
           When set ignore password expiration as defined by the <i>shadow</i>
           entry of the user. The option has an effect only in case
           <i>pam_unix</i> was not used for the authentication or it returned
           authentication failure meaning that other authentication
           source or method succeeded. The example can be public key
           authentication in <i>sshd</i>. The module will return <b>PAM_SUCCESS</b>
           instead of eventual <b>PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD </b>or
           <b>PAM_AUTHTOK_EXPIRED</b>.

       Invalid arguments are logged with <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.
