NAME </h2>
<pre>
       yum-cron - an interface to conveniently call yum from cron
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>yum-cron </b>[config-file]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>yum-cron </b>is an alternate interface to yum that is optimised to be
       convenient to call from cron.  It provides methods to keep
       repository metadata up to date, and to check for, download, and
       apply updates.  Rather than accepting many different command line
       arguments, the different functions of yum-cron can be accessed
       through config files.

       <i>config-file</i> is used to optionally specify the path to the
       configuration file to use.  If it is not given, the default
       configuration file will be used.  It is useful to be able to
       specify different configuration files for different use cases.
       For example, one configuration file might be set to update the
       repository metadata, and a line could be added to the crontab to
       run yum-cron frequently using this file.  Then, another
       configuration file might be set to install updates, and yum-cron
       could be run from cron using this file just once each day.
