NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cryptsetup-repair - repair the device metadata
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cryptsetup </b><i>repair</i> <b>[&lt;options&gt;] &lt;device&gt;</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Tries to repair the device metadata if possible. Currently
       supported only for LUKS device type.

       This command is useful to fix some known benign LUKS metadata
       header corruptions. Only basic corruptions of unused keyslot are
       fixable. This command will only change the LUKS header, not any
       key-slot data. You may enforce LUKS version by adding --type
       option.

       It also repairs (upgrades) LUKS2 reencryption metadata by adding
       a metadata digest that protects it against malicious changes.

       If LUKS2 reencryption was interrupted in the middle of writing
       reencryption segment the repair command can be used to perform
       reencryption recovery so that reencryption can continue later.
       Repairing reencryption requires verification of reencryption
       keyslot so passphrase or keyfile is needed.

       <b>&lt;options&gt; </b>can be [--timeout, --verify-passphrase,
       --disable-locks, --type, --header, --key-file, --keyfile-size,
       --keyfile-offset, --key-slot].

       <b>WARNING: </b>Always create a binary backup of the original header
       before calling this command.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--batch-mode, -q</b>
           Suppresses all confirmation questions. Use with care!

           If the --verify-passphrase option is not specified, this
           option also switches off the passphrase verification.

       <b>--debug or --debug-json</b>
           Run in debug mode with full diagnostic logs. Debug output
           lines are always prefixed by <b>#</b>.

           If --debug-json is used, additional LUKS2 JSON data
           structures are printed.

       <b>--disable-locks</b>
           Disable lock protection for metadata on disk. This option is
           valid only for LUKS2 and ignored for other formats.

           <b>WARNING: </b>Do not use this option unless you run cryptsetup in
           a restricted environment where locking is impossible to
           perform (where /run directory cannot be used).

       <b>--header &lt;device or file storing the LUKS header&gt;</b>
           Use a detached (separated) metadata device or file where the
           LUKS header is stored. This option allows one to store
           ciphertext and LUKS header on different devices.

           For commands that change the LUKS header (e.g. <i>luksAddKey</i>),
           specify the device or file with the LUKS header directly as
           the LUKS device.

       <b>--help, -?</b>
           Show help text and default parameters.

       <b>--key-file, -d </b><i>name</i>
           Read the passphrase from file.

           If the name given is "-", then the passphrase will be read
           from stdin. In this case, reading will not stop at newline
           characters.

           See section <i>NOTES ON PASSPHRASE PROCESSING</i> in <a href="cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a>
           for more information.

       <b>--keyfile-offset </b><i>value</i>
           Skip <i>value</i> bytes at the beginning of the key file.

       <b>--keyfile-size, -l </b><i>value</i>
           Read a maximum of <i>value</i> bytes from the key file. The default
           is to read the whole file up to the compiled-in maximum that
           can be queried with --help. Supplying more data than the
           compiled-in maximum aborts the operation.

           This option is useful to cut trailing newlines, for example.
           If --keyfile-offset is also given, the size count starts
           after the offset.

       <b>--key-slot, -S &lt;0-N&gt;</b>
           For LUKS operations that add key material, this option allows
           you to specify which key slot is selected for the new key.

           The maximum number of key slots depends on the LUKS version.
           LUKS1 can have up to 8 key slots. LUKS2 can have up to 32 key
           slots based on key slot area size and key size, but a valid
           key slot ID can always be between 0 and 31 for LUKS2.

       <b>--timeout, -t &lt;number of seconds&gt;</b>
           The number of seconds to wait before timeout on passphrase
           input via terminal. It is relevant every time a passphrase is
           asked. It has no effect if used in conjunction with
           --key-file.

           This option is useful when the system should not stall if the
           user does not input a passphrase, e.g. during boot. The
           default is a value of 0 seconds, which means to wait forever.

       <b>--type &lt;device-type&gt;</b>
           Specifies required device type, for more info read <i>BASIC</i>
           <i>ACTIONS</i> section in <a href="cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a>.

       <b>--usage</b>
           Show short option help.

       <b>--verify-passphrase, -y</b>
           When interactively asking for a passphrase, ask for it twice
           and complain if both inputs do not match. Ignored on input
           from file or stdin.

       <b>--version, -V</b>
           Show the program version.
