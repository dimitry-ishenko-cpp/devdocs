NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stap-server - systemtap compile server management
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       [ <b>service </b>] <b>stap-server </b>{ <b>start </b>| <b>stop </b>| <b>restart </b>| <b>condrestart </b>|
       <b>try-restart </b>| <b>force-reload </b>| <b>status </b>} [ <i>options</i> ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A systemtap compile server listens for connections from stap
       clients on a secure SSL network port and accepts requests to run
       the <i>stap</i> front end. Each server advertises its presence and
       configuration on the local network using mDNS (<i>avahi</i>) allowing
       for automatic detection by clients.

       The stap-server script aims to provide:

       •   management of systemtap compile servers as a service.

       •   convenient control over configured servers and individual
           (ad-hoc) servers.
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       One of the actions below must be specified:

       <b>start  </b>Start servers. The specified servers are started.  If no
              server is specified, the configured servers are started.
              If no servers are configured, a server for the kernel
              release and architecture of the host is started.  If a
              specified server is already started, this action will be
              ignored for that server. If a server fails to start, this
              action fails.

       <b>stop   </b>Stop server(s). The specified servers are stopped.  If no
              server is specified, all currently running servers are
              stopped.  If a specified server is not running, this
              action will be successful for that server. If a server
              fails to stop, this action fails.

       <b>restart</b>
              Stop and restart servers. The specified servers are
              stopped and restarted.  If no server is specified, all
              currently running servers are stopped and restarted. If no
              servers are running, this action behaves like <i>start</i>.

       <b>condrestart</b>
              Stop and restart servers. The specified servers are
              stopped and restarted.  If a specified server is not
              running, it is not started. If no server is specified, all
              currently running servers are stopped and restarted.  If
              no servers are running, none will be started.

       <b>try-restart</b>
              This action is identical to <i>condrestart</i>.

       <b>force-reload</b>
              Stop all running servers, reload config files and restart
              the service as if <i>start</i> was specified.

       <b>status </b>Print information about running servers. Information about
              the specified server(s) will be printed. If no server is
              specified, information about all running servers will be
              printed.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are used to provide additional
       configuration and to specify servers to be managed:

       <b>-c </b><i>configfile</i>
              This option specifies a global configuration file in
              addition to the default global configuration file
              described below. This file will be processed after the
              default global configuration file. If the <b>-c </b>option is
              specified more than once, the last configuration file
              specified will be used.

       <b>-a </b><i>architecture</i>
              This option specifies the target architecture of the
              server and is analogous to the <b>-a </b>option of <i>stap</i>. See the
              <a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> manual page for more details.  The default
              architecture is the architecture of the host.

       <b>-r </b><i>kernel-release</i>
              This option specifies a target kernel release of the
              server and is analogous to the <b>-r </b>option of <i>stap</i>.  See the
              <a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> manual page for more details.  The default release
              is that of the currently running kernel.  A server can
              handle multiple releases by specifying multiple <b>-r </b>flags.

       <b>-I </b><i>path</i>
              This option specifies an additional path to be searched by
              the server(s) for tapsets and is analogous to the <b>-I</b>
              option of <i>stap</i>.  See the <a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> manual page for more
              details.

       <b>-R </b><i>path</i>
              This option specifies the location of the systemtap
              runtime to be used by the server(s) and is analogous to
              the <b>-R </b>option of <i>stap</i>.  See the <a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> manual page for
              more details.

       <b>-B </b><i>options</i>
              This option specifies options to be passed to <i>make</i> when
              building systemtap modules and is analogous to the <b>-B</b>
              option of <i>stap</i>.  See the <a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> manual page for more
              details.

       <b>-i     </b>This option is a shortcut which specifies a server that
              handles every release installed in <i>/lib/modules/</i>.

       <b>-n </b><i>nickname</i>
              This option allows the specification of a server
              configuration by nickname.  When <b>-n </b>is specified, a
              currently running server with the given nickname will be
              searched for. If no currently running server with the
              given nickname is found, a server configuration with the
              given nickname will be searched for in the configuration
              files for default servers, or the path configured in the
              global configuration file or the configuration file
              specified by the <b>-c </b>option. If a server configuration for
              the given nickname is found, the <b>-a</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-I</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-B </b>and <b>-u</b>
              options for that server will be used as if they were
              specified on the command line. If no configuration with
              the given nickname is found, and the action is <i>start</i> (or
              an action behaving like <i>start</i> (see <b>ARGUMENTS</b>), the server
              will be started with the given nickname.  If no
              configuration with the given nickname is found, and the
              action is not <i>start</i> (or an action behaving like <i>start</i>), it
              is an error. If a nickname is not specified for a server
              which is being started, its nickname will be its process
              id.

       <b>-p </b><i>pid</i> This option allows the specification of a server
              configuration by process id.  When <b>-p </b>is specified, a
              currently running server with the given process id will be
              searched for. If no such server is found, it is an error.
              If a server with the given process id is found, the <b>-a</b>,
              <b>-r</b>, <b>-I</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-B </b>and <b>-u </b>options for that server will be used
              as if they were specified on the command line.

       <b>-u </b><i>user-name</i>
              Each systemtap compile server is normally run by the user
              name <i>stap-server</i> (for the initscript) or as the user
              invoking <i>stap-server</i>, unless otherwise configured (see
              <b>FILES</b>). This option specifies the user name used to run
              the server(s). The user name specified must be a member of
              the group <i>stap-server</i>.

       <b>--log </b><i>logfile</i>
              This option allows the specification of a separate log
              file for each server.  Each --log option is added to a
              list which will be applied, in turn, to each server
              specified. If more servers are specified than --log
              options, the default log file (see <b>FILES</b>) will be used for
              subsequent servers.

       <b>--port </b><i>port-number</i>
              This option allows the specification of a specific network
              port for each server. Each --port option is added to a
              list which will be applied, in turn, to each server
              specified. If more servers are specified than --port
              options, a randomly selected port is used for subsequent
              servers.

       <b>--ssl </b><i>certificate-db-path</i>
              This option allows the specification of a separate NSS
              certificate database for each server. Each --ssl option is
              added to a list which will be applied, in turn, to each
              server specified. If more servers are specified than --ssl
              options, the default certificate database (see <b>FILES</b>) for
              subsequent servers.

       <b>--max-threads </b><i>threads</i>
              This option allows the specification of the maximum number
              of worker threads to handle concurrent requests. If
              <i>threads</i> == 0, each request will be handled on the main
              thread, serially.  The default is the number of available
              processor cores.

       <b>--max-request-size </b><i>size</i>
              This options allows the specification of the maximum size
              of an uncompressed client request. The arguement <i>size</i> is
              specified in bytes. The default is the 50000 bytes.

       <b>--max-compressed-request </b><i>size</i>
              This options allows the specification of the maximum size
              of a compressed client request. The arguement <i>size</i> is
              specified in bytes. The default is the 5000 bytes.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Configuration files allow us to:

       •   specify global configuration of logging, server configuration
           files, status files and other global parameters.

       •   specify which servers are to be started by default.
</pre> <h2>
Global Configuration </h2>
<pre>
       The Global Configuration file contains variable assignments used
       to configure the overall operation of the service.  Each line
       beginning with a '#' character is ignored. All other lines must
       be of the form <i>VARIABLE=VALUE</i>. This is not a shell script. The
       entire contents of the line after the = will be assigned as-is to
       the variable.

       The following variables may be assigned:

       <b>CONFIG_PATH</b>
              Specifies the absolute path of the directory containing
              the default server configurations.

       <b>STAT_PATH</b>
              Specifies the absolute path of the running server status
              directory.

       <b>LOG_FILE</b>
              Specifies the absolute path of the log file.

       <b>STAP_USER</b>
              Specifies the userid which will be used to run the
              server(s) (default: for the initscript <i>stap-server</i>,
              otherwise the user running <i>stap-server</i>).

       Here is an example of a Global Configuration file:

              CONFIG_PATH=~&lt;user&gt;/my-stap-server-configs
              LOG_FILE=/tmp/stap-server/log
</pre> <h2>
Individual Server Configuration </h2>
<pre>
       Each server configuration file configures a server to be started
       when no server is specified for the <i>start</i> action, or an action
       behaving like the <i>start</i> action (see <i>ARGUMENTS</i>). Each configura‐
       tion file contains variable assignments used to configure an in‐
       dividual server.

       Each line beginning with a '#' character is ignored. All other
       lines must be of the form <i>VARIABLE=VALUE</i>. This is not a shell
       script. The entire contents of the line after the = will be as‐
       signed as-is to the variable.

       Each configuration file must have a filename suffix of <i>.conf</i>. See
       <a href="../man7/stappaths.7.html">stappaths(7)</a> for the default location of these files.  This de‐
       fault location can be overridden in the global configuration file
       using the <b>-c </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>).

       The following variables may be assigned:

       <b>ARCH   </b>Specifies the target architecture for this server and cor‐
              responds to the <b>-a </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>). If <b>ARCH </b>is not
              set, the architecture of the host will be used.

       <b>RELEASE</b>
              Specifies a kernel release for this server and corresponds
              to the <b>-r </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>). If <b>RELEASE </b>is not set, the
              release of the kernel running on the host will be used.

       <b>BUILD  </b>Specifies options to be passed to the <i>make</i> process used by
              <i>systemtap</i> to build kernel modules.  This an array variable
              with each element corresponding to a <b>-B </b>option (see <i>OP‐</i>
              <i>TIONS</i>). Using the form <b>BUILD=STRING </b>clears the array and
              sets the first element to <b>STRING</b>. Using the form
              <b>BUILD+=STRING </b>adds <b>STRING </b>as an additional element to the
              array.

       <b>INCLUDE</b>
              Specifies a list of directories to be searched by the
              server for tapsets.  This is an array variable with each
              element corresponding to a <b>-I </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>). Using
              the form <b>INCLUDE=PATH </b>clears the array and sets the first
              element to <b>PATH</b>. Using the form <b>INCLUDE+=PATH </b>adds <b>PATH </b>as
              an additional element to the array.

       <b>RUNTIME</b>
              Specifies the directory which contains the systemtap run‐
              time code to be used by this server and corresponds to the
              <b>-R </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>).

       <b>USER   </b>Specifies the user name to be used to run this server and
              corresponds to the <b>-u </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>).

       <b>NICKNAME</b>
              Specifies the nickname to be used to refer to this server
              and corresponds to the <b>-n </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>).

       <b>LOG    </b>Specifies the location of the log file to be used by this
              server and corresponds to the <b>--log </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>).

       <b>PORT   </b>Specifies the network port to be used by this server and
              corresponds to the <b>--port </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>).

       <b>SSL    </b>Specifies the location of the NSS certificate database to
              be used by this server and corresponds to the <b>--ssl </b>option
              (see <i>OPTIONS</i>).

       <b>MAXTHREADS</b>
              Specifies the maximum number of worker threads to handle
              concurrent requests to be used by this server and corre‐
              sponds to the <b>--max-threads </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>).

       <b>MAXREQSIZE</b>
              Specifies the maximum size of an uncompressed client re‐
              quest, to be used by this server and correspnds to the
              <b>--max-request-size </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>).

       <b>MAXCOMPRESSEDREQ</b>
              Specifies the maximum size of an compressed client re‐
              quest, to be used by this server and correspnds to the
              <b>--max-compressed-request </b>option (see <i>OPTIONS</i>).

       Here is an example of a server configuration file:

              ARCH=
              USER=
              RELEASE=
              NICKNAME=native

       By keeping the ARCH, USER, and RELEASE fields blank, they will
       default to the current arch and release and use the default user.

       A more specific example:

              ARCH=i386
              RELEASE=2.6.18-128.el5
              PORT=5001
              LOG=/path/to/log/file

       And here is a more complicated example:

              USER=serveruser
              RELEASE=/kernels/2.6.18-92.1.18.el5/build
              INCLUDE=/mytapsets
              INCLUDE+=/yourtapsets
              BUILD='VARIABLE1=VALUE1 VARIABLE2=VALUE2'
              DEFINE=STP_MAXMEMORY=1024
              DEFINE+=DEBUG_TRANS
              RUNTIME=/myruntime
              NICKNAME=my-server
              SSL=/path/to/NSS/certificate/database
</pre> <h2>
SERVER AUTHENTICATION </h2>
<pre>
       The security of the SSL network connection between the client and
       server depends on the proper management of server certificates.

       The trustworthiness of a given systemtap compile server can not
       be determined automatically without a trusted certificate author‐
       ity issuing systemtap compile server certificates. This is not
       practical in everyday use and so, clients must authenticate
       servers against their own database of trusted server certifi‐
       cates. In this context, establishing a given server as trusted by
       a given client means adding that server's certificate to the
       client's database of trusted servers.

       For the <i>stap-server</i> initscript, on the local host, this is han‐
       dled automatically.  When the <i>systemtap-server</i> package is in‐
       stalled, the server's certificate for the default user
       (<i>stap-server</i>) is automatically generated and installed. This
       means that servers started by the <i>stap-server</i> initscript, with
       the default user, are automatically trusted by clients on the lo‐
       cal host, both as an SSL peer and as a systemtap module signer.

       Furthermore, when stap is invoked by an unprivileged user (not
       root, not a member of the group stapdev, but a member of the
       group stapusr and possibly the group stapsys), the options
       <i>--use-server</i> and <i>--privilege</i> are automatically added to the spec‐
       ified options.  This means that unprivileged users on the local
       host can use a server on the local host in unprivileged mode with
       no further setup or options required. Normal users (those in none
       of the SystemTap groups) can also use compile-servers through the
       <i>--use-server</i> and <i>--privilege</i> options. But they will of course be
       unable to load the module (the <i>-p4</i> option can be used to stop
       short of loading).

       In order to use a server running on another host, that server's
       certificate must be installed on the client's host.  See the
       <i>--trust-servers</i> option in the <a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> manual page for more de‐
       tails and README.unprivileged in the systemtap sources for more
       details.

<pre>
       See the <a href="../man3/stapex.3stap.html">stapex(3stap)</a> manual page for a collection of sample <i>sys‐</i>
       <i>temtap</i> scripts.

       To start the configured servers, or the default server, if none
       are configured:

        <b>$ [ service ] stap-server start</b>

       To start a server that handles all kernel versions installed in
       /lib/modules:

        <b>$ [ service ] stap-server start -i</b>

       To obtain information about the running server(s):

        <b>$ [ service ] stap-server status</b>

       To start a server like another one, except targeting a different
       architecture, by referencing the first server's nickname:

        <b>$ [ service ] stap-server start -n </b><i>NICKNAME</i> <b>-a </b><i>ARCH</i>

       To start a server for a kernel release not installed (cross-com‐
       piling)

        <b>$ [ service ] stap-server start -a </b><i>ARCH</i> <b>-r </b><i>/BUILDDIR</i>

       To stop one of the servers by referencing its process id (ob‐
       tained by running <b>stap-server status</b>):

        <b>$ [ service ] stap-server stop -p </b><i>PID</i>

       To run a script using a compile server:

        <b>$ stap SCRIPT --use-server</b>

       To run a script as an unprivileged user using a compile server:

        <b>$ stap SCRIPT</b>

       To stop all running servers:

        <b>$ [ service ] stap-server stop</b>

       To restart servers after a global configuration change and/or
       when default servers have been added, changed, or removed:

        <b>$ [ service ] stap-server force-reload</b>

SAFETY AND SECURITY </h2>
<pre>
       Systemtap is an administrative tool.  It exposes kernel internal
       data structures and potentially private user information.  See
       the <a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> manual page for additional information on safety and
       security.

       As a network server, stap-server should be activated with care in
       order to limit the potential effects of bugs or mischevious
       users.  Consider the following prophylactic measures.

       1      Run stap-server as an unprivileged user, never as root.

              When invoked as a service (i.e. <b>service stap-server </b>...),
              each server is run, by default, as the user <i>stap-server</i>.
              When invoked directly (i.e. <b>stap-server </b>...), each server
              is run, by default, as the invoking user. In each case,
              another user may be selected by using the <i>-u</i> option on in‐
              vocation, by specifying <i>STAP_USER=</i>username in the global
              configuration file or by specifying <i>USER=</i>username in an
              individual server configuration file. The invoking user
              must have authority to run processes as another user.  See
              <i>CONFIGURATION</i>.

              The selected user must have write access to the server log
              file.  The location of the server log file may be changed
              by setting <i>LOG_FILE=</i>path in the global configuration file.
              See <i>CONFIGURATION</i>.

              The selected user must have read/write access to the di‐
              rectory containing the server status files.  The location
              of the server status files may be changed by setting
              <i>STAT_PATH=</i>path in the global configuration file.  See <i>CON‐</i>
              <i>FIGURATION</i>.

              The selected user must have read/write access to the up‐
              robes.ko build directory and its files.

              Neither form of stap-server will run if the selected user
              is root.

       2      Run stap-server requests with resource limits that impose
              maximum cpu time, file size, memory consumption, in order
              to bound the effects of processing excessively large or
              bogus inputs.

              When the user running the server is <i>stap-server</i>, each
              server request is run with limits specified in <i>~stap-serv‐</i>
              <i>er/.systemtap/rc</i> otherwise, no limits are imposed.

       3      Run stap-server with a TMPDIR environment variable that
              points to a separate and/or quota-enforced directory, in
              order to prevent filling up of important filesystems.

              The default TMPDIR is <i>/tmp/</i>.

       4      Activate network firewalls to limit stap client connec‐
              tions to relatively trustworthy networks.

              For automatic selection of servers by clients, <i>avahi</i> must
              be installed on both the server and client hosts and <i>mDNS</i>
              messages must be allowed through the firewall.

       The systemtap compile server and its related utilities use the
       Secure Socket Layer (SSL) as implemented by Network Security Ser‐
       vices (NSS) for network security. NSS is also used for the gener‐
       ation and management of certificates. The related certificate
       databases must be protected in order to maintain the security of
       the system.  Use of the utilities provided will help to ensure
       that the proper protection is maintained. The systemtap client
       will check for proper access permissions before making use of any
       certificate database.
