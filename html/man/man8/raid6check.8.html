NAME </h2>
<pre>
       raid6check - check MD RAID6 device for errors <i>aka</i> Linux Software
       RAID
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>raid6check </b><i>&lt;raid6 device&gt; &lt;start stripe&gt; &lt;number of stripes&gt;</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       RAID6 devices in which one single component drive has errors can
       use the double parity in order to find out which component drive.
       The "raid6check" tool checks, for each stripe, the double parity
       consistency, reports mismatches and, if possible, which component
       drive has the mismatch.  Since it works at stripe level, it can
       report different drives with mismatches at different stripes.

       "raid6check" requires a non-degraded RAID6 MD device as first
       parameter, a starting stripe (usually 0) and the number of
       stripes to be checked.  If this third parameter is also 0, it
       will check the array up to the end.

       "raid6check" will start printing information about the RAID6,
       then for each stripe, it will report the parity rotation status.
       In case of parity mismatches, "raid6check" reports, if possible,
       which component drive could be responsible. Otherwise it reports
       that it is not possible to find the component drive.

       If the given MD device is not a RAID6, "raid6check" will, of
       course, not continue.

       If the RAID6 MD device is degraded, "raid6check" will report an
       error and it will not proceed further.

       No write operations are performed on the array or the components.
       Furthermore, the checked array can be online and in use during
       the operation of "raid6check".

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
         <b>raid6check /dev/md0 0 0</b>
       This will check /dev/md0 from start to end.

         <b>raid6check /dev/md3 0 1</b>
       This will check the first stripe of /dev/md3.

         <b>raid6check /dev/md1 1000 0</b>
       This will check /dev/md1 from stripe 1000 up to the end.

         <b>raid6check /dev/m127 128 256</b>
       This will check 256 stripes of /dev/md127 starting from stripe
       128.

         <b>raid6check /dev/md0 0 0 | grep -i error &gt; md0_err.log</b>
       This will check /dev/md0 completely and create a log file only
       with errors, if any.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       "raid6check" uses directly the component drives as found in /dev.
       Furthermore, the sysfs interface is needed in order to find out
       the RAID6 parameters.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Negative parameters can lead to unexpected results.

       It is not clear what will happen if the RAID6 MD device gets
       degraded during the check.
