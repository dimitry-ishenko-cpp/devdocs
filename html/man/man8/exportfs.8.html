DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       An NFS server maintains a table of local physical file systems
       that are accessible to NFS clients.  Each file system in this
       table is  referred to as an <i>exported file system</i>, or <i>export</i>, for
       short.

       The <b>exportfs </b>command maintains the current table of exports for
       the NFS server.  The master export table is kept in a file named
       <i>/var/lib/nfs/etab</i>.  This file is read by <b>rpc.mountd </b>when a client
       sends an NFS MOUNT request.

       Normally the master export table is initialized with the contents
       of <i>/etc/exports</i> and files under <i>/etc/exports.d</i> by invoking
       <b>exportfs -a</b>.  However, a system administrator can choose to add
       or delete exports without modifying <i>/etc/exports</i> or files under
       <i>/etc/exports.d</i> by using the <b>exportfs </b>command.

       <b>exportfs </b>and its partner program <b>rpc.mountd </b>work in one of two
       modes: a legacy mode which applies to 2.4 and earlier versions of
       the Linux kernel, and a new mode which applies to 2.6 and later
       versions, providing the <b>nfsd </b>virtual filesystem has been mounted
       at <i>/proc/fs/nfsd</i> or <i>/proc/fs/nfs</i>.  On 2.6 kernels, if this
       filesystem is not mounted, the legacy mode is used.

       In the new mode, <b>exportfs </b>does not give any information to the
       kernel, but provides it only to <b>rpc.mountd </b>through the
       <i>/var/lib/nfs/etab</i> file.  <b>rpc.mountd </b>then manages kernel requests
       for information about exports, as needed.

       In the legacy mode, exports which identify a specific host,
       rather than a subnet or netgroup, are entered directly into the
       kernel's export table, as well as being written to
       <i>/var/lib/nfs/etab</i>.  Further, exports listed in <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i>
       which match a non host-specific export request will cause an
       appropriate export entry for the host given in <i>rmtab</i> to be added
       to the kernel's export table.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d kind  or  --debug kind</b>
              Turn on debugging. Valid kinds are: all, auth, call,
              general and parse.  Debugging can also be turned on by
              setting <b>debug= </b>in the <b>[exportfs] </b>section of <i>/etc/nfs.conf</i>.

       <b>-a     </b>Export or unexport all directories.

       <b>-o </b><i>options,...</i>
              Specify a list of export options in the same manner as in
              <a href="../man5/exports.5.html">exports(5)</a>.

       <b>-i     </b>Ignore the <i>/etc/exports</i> file and files under
              <i>/etc/exports.d</i> directory.  Only default options and
              options given on the command line are used.

       <b>-r     </b>Reexport all directories, synchronizing <i>/var/lib/nfs/etab</i>
              with <i>/etc/exports</i> and files under <i>/etc/exports.d</i>.  This
              option removes entries in <i>/var/lib/nfs/etab</i> which have
              been deleted from <i>/etc/exports</i> or files under
              <i>/etc/exports.d</i>, and removes any entries from the kernel
              export table which are no longer valid.

       <b>-u     </b>Unexport one or more directories.

       <b>-f     </b>If <i>/proc/fs/nfsd</i> or <i>/proc/fs/nfs</i> is mounted, flush
              everything out of the kernel's export table.  Fresh
              entries for active clients are added to the kernel's
              export table by <b>rpc.mountd </b>when they make their next NFS
              mount request.

       <b>-v     </b>Be verbose. When exporting or unexporting, show what's
              going on. When displaying the current export list, also
              display the list of export options.

       <b>-s     </b>Display the current export list suitable for /etc/exports.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>[exportfs] </b>section of the <i>/etc/nfs.conf</i> configuration file
       can contain a <b>debug </b>value, which can be one or more from the list
       <b>general</b>, <b>call</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>parse</b>, <b>all</b>.  When a list is given, the
       members should be comma-separated.

       <b>exportfs </b>will also recognize the <b>state-directory-path </b>value from
       both the <b>[mountd] </b>section and the <b>[exportd] </b>section
</pre> <h2>
DISCUSSION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Exporting Directories</b>
       The first synopsis shows how to invoke <b>exportfs </b>when adding new
       entries to the export table.  When using <b>exportfs -a</b>, all exports
       listed in <i>/etc/exports</i> and files under <i>/etc/exports.d</i> are added
       to <i>/var/lib/nfs/etab</i>.  The kernel's export table is also updated
       as needed.

       The <i>host:/path</i> argument specifies a local directory to export,
       along with the client or clients who are permitted to access it.
       See <a href="../man5/exports.5.html">exports(5)</a> for a description of supported options and access
       list formats.

       IPv6 presentation addresses contain colons, which are already
       used to separate the "host" and "path" command line arguments.
       When specifying a client using a raw IPv6 address, enclose the
       address in square brackets.  For IPv6 network addresses, place
       the prefix just after the closing bracket.

       To export a directory to the world, simply specify <i>:/path</i>.

       The export options for a particular host/directory pair derive
       from several sources.  The default export options are
       <b>sync,ro,root_squash,wdelay</b>.  These can be overridden by entries
       in <i>/etc/exports</i> or files under <i>/etc/exports.d</i>.

       A system administrator may override options from these sources
       using the <b>-o </b>command-line option on <b>exportfs</b>.  This option takes
       a comma-separated list of options in the same fashion as one
       would specify them in <i>/etc/exports</i>.  In this way <b>exportfs </b>can be
       used to modify the export options of an already exported
       directory.

   <b>Unexporting Directories</b>
       The third synopsis shows how to unexport a currently exported
       directory.  When using <b>exportfs -ua</b>, all entries listed in
       <i>/var/lib/nfs/etab</i> are removed from the kernel export tables, and
       the file is cleared. This effectively shuts down all NFS
       activity.

       To remove an export, specify a <i>host:/path</i> pair. This deletes the
       specified entry from <i>/var/lib/nfs/etab</i> and removes the
       corresponding kernel entry (if any).

   <b>Dumping the Export Table</b>
       Invoking <b>exportfs </b>without options shows the current list of
       exported file systems.  Adding the <b>-v </b>option causes <b>exportfs </b>to
       display the export options for each export.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following adds all directories listed in <i>/etc/exports</i> and
       files under <i>/etc/exports.d</i> to <i>/var/lib/nfs/etab</i> and pushes the
       resulting export entries into the kernel:

       <b># exportfs -a</b>

       To export the <i>/usr/tmp</i> directory to host <b>django</b>, allowing
       insecure file locking requests from clients:

       <b># exportfs -o insecure_locks django:/usr/tmp</b>

       To unexport the <i>/usr/tmp</i> directory:

       <b># exportfs -u django:/usr/tmp</b>

       To unexport all exports listed in <i>/etc/exports</i> and files under
       <i>/etc/exports.d</i>:

       <b># exportfs -au</b>

       To export the <i>/usr/tmp</i> directory to IPv6 link-local clients:

       <b># exportfs [fe80::]/64:/usr/tmp</b>
</pre> <h2>
USAGE NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Exporting to IP networks or DNS and NIS domains does not enable
       clients from these groups to access NFS immediately.  Rather,
       these sorts of exports are hints to <a href="rpc.mountd.8.html">rpc.mountd(8)</a> to grant any
       mount requests from these clients.  This is usually not a
       problem, because any existing mounts are preserved in <i>rmtab</i>
       across reboots.

       When unexporting a network or domain entry, any current exports
       to members of this group will be checked against the remaining
       valid exports and if they themselves are no longer valid they
       will be removed.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/exports</i>
              input file listing exports, export options, and access
              control lists

       <i>/etc/exports.d</i>
              directory where extra input files are stored.  <b>Note: </b>only
              files that end with <i>.exports</i> are used.

       <i>/var/lib/nfs/etab</i>
              master table of exports

       <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i>
              table of clients accessing server's exports
