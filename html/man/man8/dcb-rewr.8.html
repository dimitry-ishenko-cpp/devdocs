DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dcb rewr </b>is used to configure the rewrite table, in the DCB (Data
       Center Bridging) subsystem.  The rewrite table is used to rewrite
       certain values in the packet headers, based on packet priority.

       DCB rewrite entries are, like DCB APP entries, 3-tuples of
       selector, protocol ID, and priority. Selector is an enumeration
       that picks one of the prioritization namespaces. Currently, only
       the DSCP and PCP selector namespaces are supported by dcb rewr.

       The rewrite table is a list of DCB rewrite rules, that applies to
       packets with matching priority.  Notably, it is valid to have
       conflicting rewrite assignment for the same selector and
       priority. For example, the set of two rewrite entries (DSCP, 10,
       1) and (DSCP, 11, 1), where packets with priority 1 should have
       its DSCP value rewritten to both 10 and 11, form a well-defined
       rewrite table.  <b>dcb rewr </b>tool allows low-level management of the
       rewrite table by adding and deleting individual rewrite 3-tuples
       through <b>add </b>and <b>del </b>commands. On the other hand, the command
       <b>replace </b>does what one would typically want in this
       situation--first adds the new configuration, and then removes the
       obsolete one, so that only one rewrite rule is in effect for a
       given selector and priority.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>show   </b>Display all entries with a given selector. When no
              selector is given, shows all rewrite table entries
              categorized per selector.

       <b>flush  </b>Remove all entries with a given selector. When no selector
              is given, removes all rewrite table entries.

       <b>add</b>
       <b>del    </b>Add and, respectively, remove individual rewrite 3-tuples
              to and from the DCB rewrite table.

       <b>replace</b>
              Take the list of entries mentioned as parameter, and add
              those that are not present in the rewrite table yet. Then
              remove those entries, whose selector and priority have
              been mentioned as parameter, but not with the exact same
              protocol ID. This has the effect of, for the given
              selector and priority, causing that the table only
              contains the protocol ID (or ID's) given as parameter.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following table shows parameters in a way that they would be
       used with <b>add</b>, <b>del </b>and <b>replace </b>commands. For <b>show </b>and <b>flush</b>, the
       parameter name is to be used as a simple keyword without further
       arguments.

       <b>prio-dscp </b><i>DSCP-MAP</i>
              <i>DSCP-MAP</i> uses the array parameter syntax, see <a href="dcb.8.html">dcb(8)</a> for
              details. Keys are priorities, values are DSCP points for
              traffic with matching priority. DSCP points can be written
              either directly as numeric values, or using symbolic names
              specified in <b>/etc/iproute2/rt_dsfield </b>(however note that
              the file specifies full 8-bit dsfield values, whereas <b>dcb</b>
              <b>rewr </b>will only use the higher six bits).  <b>dcb rewr show</b>
              will similarly format DSCP values as symbolic names if
              possible. The command line option <b>-N </b>turns the show
              translation off.

       <b>prio-pcp </b><i>PCP-MAP</i>
              <i>PCP-MAP</i> uses the array parameter syntax, see <a href="dcb.8.html">dcb(8)</a> for
              details. Keys are priorities. Values are PCP/DEI for
              traffic with matching priority. PCP/DEI values are written
              as a combination of numeric- and symbolic values, to
              accommodate for both. PCP always in numeric form e.g 0 ..
              7 and DEI in symbolic form e.g 'de' (drop-eligible),
              indicating that the DEI bit is 1 or 'nd' (not-drop-
              eligible), indicating that the DEI bit is 0.  In
              combination 1:2de translates to a mapping of priority 1 to
              PCP=2 and DEI=1.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE &amp; USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Add a rule to rewrite DSCP to 0, 24 and 48 for traffic with
       priority 0, 3 and 6, respectively:

       # dcb rewr add dev eth0 prio-dscp 0:0 3:24 6:48

       Add a rule to rewrite DSCP to 25 for traffic with priority 3:

       # dcb rewr add dev eth0 prio-dscp 3:25
       # dcb rewr show dev eth0 prio-dscp
       prio-dscp 0:0 3:CS3 3:25 6:CS6
       # dcb -N rewr show dev eth0 prio-dscp
       prio-dscp 0:0 3:24 3:25 6:48

       Reconfigure the table so that only one rule exists for rewriting
       traffic with priority 3.

       # dcb rewr replace dev eth0 prio-dscp 3:26
       # dcb rewr -N show dev eth0 prio-dscp
       prio-dscp 0:0 3:26 6:48

       Flush all DSCP rules:

       # dcb rewr flush dev eth0 prio-dscp
       # dcb rewr show dev eth0 prio-dscp
       (nothing)

       Add a rule to rewrite PCP to 1 and DEI to 0 for traffic with
       priority 1 and a rule to rewrite PCP to 2 and DEI to 1 for
       traffic with priority 2:

       # dcb rewr add dev eth0 prio-pcp 1:1nd 2:2de
       # dcb rewr show dev eth0 prio-pcp
       prio-pcp 1:1nd 2:2de

EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive integer
       upon failure.
