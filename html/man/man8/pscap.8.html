NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pscap - a program to see capabilities
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pscap [ -a | -p pid ]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pscap </b>is a program that prints out a report of process
       capabilities. If the application has any capabilities, it will be
       in the report with the exception of init. By giving the -a
       command line option, init will be included, too. By giving a pid
       with the -p command line option, only the process specified with
       the pid is reported. If a process is not in the report, it has
       dropped all capabilities. If the process has partial
       capabilities, it is further examined to see if it has an open-
       ended bounding set. If this is found to be true, a '+' symbol is
       added. If the process has ambient capabilities, a '@' symbols is
       added.

       The command name in the output may be followed by an asterisk
       mark (*). This mark denotes processes which run in child user
       namespaces (relative to the user namespace of pscap itself).
