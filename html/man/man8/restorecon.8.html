</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page describes the <b>restorecon </b>program.

       This program is primarily used to set the security context
       (extended attributes) on one or more files.

       It can also be run at any other time to correct inconsistent
       labels, to add support for newly-installed policy or, by using
       the <b>-n </b>option, to passively check whether the file contexts are
       all set as specified by the active policy (default behavior).

       If a file object does not have a context, <b>restorecon </b>will write
       the default context to the file object's extended attributes. If
       a file object has a context, <b>restorecon </b>will only modify the type
       portion of the security context.  The <b>-F </b>option will force a
       replacement of the entire context.

       If a file is labeled with <b>customizable </b>SELinux type (for list of
       customizable types see
       /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/contexts/customizable_types),
       restorecon won't reset the label unless the -F option is used.

       It is the same executable as <b>setfiles </b>but operates in a slightly
       different manner depending on its argv[0].
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-e </b><i>directory</i>
              exclude a directory (repeat the option to exclude more
              than one directory, Requires full path).

       <b>-f </b><i>infilename</i>
              <i>infilename</i> contains a list of files to be processed. Use
              “<b>-</b>” for <b>stdin</b>.

       <b>-F     </b>Force reset of context to match file_context for
              customizable files, and the default file context, changing
              the user, role, range portion as well as the type.

       <b>-h, -? </b>display usage information and exit.

       <b>-i     </b>ignore files that do not exist.

       <b>-I     </b>ignore digest to force checking of labels even if the
              stored SHA1 digest matches the specfiles SHA1 digest. The
              digest will then be updated provided there are no errors.
              See the <b>NOTES </b>section for further details.

       <b>-D     </b>Set or update any directory SHA1 digests. Use this option
              to enable usage of the <i>security.sehash</i> extended attribute.

       <b>-m     </b>do not read <b>/proc/mounts </b>to obtain a list of non-seclabel
              mounts to be excluded from relabeling checks.  Setting
              this option is useful where there is a non-seclabel fs
              mounted with a seclabel fs mounted on a directory below
              this.

       <b>-n     </b>don't change any file labels (passive check).  To display
              the files whose labels would be changed, add <b>-v</b>.

       <b>-o </b><i>outfilename</i>
              Deprecated - This option is no longer supported.

       <b>-p     </b>show progress by printing the number of files in 1k blocks
              unless relabeling the entire OS, that will then show the
              approximate percentage complete. Note that the <b>-p </b>and <b>-v</b>
              options are mutually exclusive.

       <b>-R, -r </b>change files and directories file labels recursively
              (descend directories).

       <b>-v     </b>show changes in file labels. Multiple -v options increase
              the verbosity. Note that the <b>-v </b>and <b>-p </b>options are
              mutually exclusive.

       <b>-W     </b>display warnings about entries that had no matching files
              by outputting the <a href="../man3/selabel_stats.3.html">selabel_stats(3)</a> results.

       <b>-0     </b>the separator for the input items is assumed to be the
              null character (instead of the white space).  The quotes
              and the backslash characters are also treated as normal
              characters that can form valid input.  This option finally
              also disables the end of file string, which is treated
              like any other argument.  Useful when input items might
              contain white space, quote marks or backslashes.  The
              <b>-print0 </b>option of GNU <b>find </b>produces input suitable for
              this mode.

       <b>-x     </b>prevent <b>restorecon </b>from crossing file system boundaries.

       <b>-T </b><i>nthreads</i>
              use up to <i>nthreads</i> threads.  Specify 0 to create as many
              threads as there are available CPU cores; 1 to use only a
              single thread (default); or any positive number to use the
              given number of threads (if possible).
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
              <i>pathname</i> ...  The pathname for the file(s) to be
              relabeled.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       1.  <b>restorecon </b>by default does not operate recursively on
           directories. Paths leading up the final component of the
           file(s) are canonicalized using <a href="../man3/realpath.3.html">realpath(3)</a> before labeling.

       2.  If the <i>pathname</i> specifies the root directory and the <b>-vR </b>or
           <b>-vr </b>options are set and the audit system is running, then an
           audit event is automatically logged stating that a "mass
           relabel" took place using the message label <b>FS_RELABEL</b>.

       3.  To improve performance when relabeling file systems
           recursively (i.e. the <b>-R </b>or <b>-r </b>option is set), the <b>-D </b>option
           to <b>restorecon </b>will cause it to store a SHA1 digest of the
           default specfiles set in an extended attribute named
           <i>security.sehash</i> on each directory specified in <i>pathname</i> ...
           once the relabeling has been completed successfully. These
           digests will be checked should <b>restorecon -D </b>be rerun with
           the same <i>pathname</i> parameters. See <a href="../man3/selinux_restorecon.3.html">selinux_restorecon(3)</a> for
           further details.

           The <b>-I </b>option will ignore the SHA1 digest from each directory
           specified in <i>pathname</i> ...  and provided the <b>-n </b>option is NOT
           set and recursive mode is set, files will be relabeled as
           required with the digests then being updated provided there
           are no errors.
