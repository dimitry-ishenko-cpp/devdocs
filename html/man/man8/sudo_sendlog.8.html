</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sudo_sendlog </b>can be used to send the existing <b>sudoers </b>I/O log
       <i>path</i> to a remote log server such as <i>sudo_logsrvd</i>(8) for central
       storage.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--accept-only</b>
               Only send the accept event, not the I/O associated with
               the log.  This can be used to test the logging of accept
               events without any associated I/O.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--ca-bundle</b>
               The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM
               format, to use instead of the system's default
               certificate authority database when authenticating the
               log server.  The default is to use the system's default
               certificate authority database.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cert</b>
               The path to the client's certificate file in PEM format.
               This setting is required when the connection to the
               remote log server is secured with TLS.

       <b>--help  </b>Display a short help message to the standard output and
               exit.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--host</b>
               Connect to the specified <i>host</i> instead of localhost.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--iolog-id</b>
               Use the specified <i>iolog-id</i> when restarting a log
               transfer.  The <i>iolog-id</i> is reported by the server when it
               creates the remote I/O log.  This option may only be used
               in conjunction with the <b>-r </b>option.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--key</b>
               The path to the client's private key file in PEM format.
               This setting is required when the connection to the
               remote log server is secured with TLS.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-verify</b>
               If specified, the server's certificate will not be
               verified during the TLS handshake.  By default,
               <b>sudo_sendlog </b>verifies that the server's certificate is
               valid and that it contains either the server's host name
               or its IP address.  This setting is only supported when
               the connection to the remote log server is secured with
               TLS.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--port</b>
               Use the specified network <i>port</i> when connecting to the log
               server instead of the default, port 30344.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--restart</b>
               Restart an interrupted connection to the log server.  The
               specified <i>restart-point</i> is used to tell the server the
               point in time at which to continue the log.  The
               <i>restart-point</i> is specified in the form
               “seconds,nanoseconds” and is usually the last commit
               point received from the server.  The <b>-i </b>option must also
               be specified when restarting a transfer.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--reject</b>
               Send a reject event for the command using the specified
               <i>reject-reason</i>, even though it was actually accepted
               locally.  This can be used to test the logging of reject
               events; no I/O will be sent.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stop-after</b>
               Stop sending log records and close the connection when
               <i>stop-point</i> is reached.  This can be used for testing
               purposes to send a partial I/O log to the server.
               Partial logs can be restarted using the <b>-r </b>option.  The
               <i>stop-point</i> is an elapsed time specified in the form
               “seconds,nanoseconds”.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--test</b>
               Open <i>number</i> simultaneous connections to the log server
               and send the specified I/O log file on each one.  This
               option is useful for performance testing.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Print the <b>sudo_sendlog </b>version and exit.

   <b>Debugging sendlog</b>
       <b>sudo_sendlog </b>supports a flexible debugging framework that is
       configured via <i>Debug</i> lines in the <i>sudo.conf</i>(5) file.

       For more information on configuring <i>sudo.conf</i>(5), refer to its
       manual.
