NAME </h2>
<pre>
       netcap - a program to see capabilities
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>netcap</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>netcap </b>is a program that prints out a report of process
       capabilities. If the application is using tcp, udp, raw, or
       packet family of sockets AND has any capabilities, it will be in
       the report. If the process has partial capabilities, it is
       further examined to see if it has an open-ended bounding set. If
       this is found to be true, a '+' symbol is added.  If the process
       has ambient capabilities, a '@' symbols is added.

       Some directories in the /proc file system are readonly by root.
       The program will try to access and report what it can. But if
       nothing comes out, try changing to the root user and re-run this
       program.
