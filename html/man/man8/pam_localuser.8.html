</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_localuser - require users to be listed in /etc/passwd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_localuser.so </b>[debug] [file=<i>/path/passwd</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       pam_localuser is a PAM module to help implementing site-wide
       login policies, where they typically include a subset of the
       network's users and a few accounts that are local to a particular
       workstation. Using pam_localuser and pam_wheel or pam_listfile is
       an effective way to restrict access to either local users and/or
       a subset of the network's users.

       This could also be implemented using pam_listfile.so and a very
       short awk script invoked by cron, but it's common enough to have
       been separated out.
