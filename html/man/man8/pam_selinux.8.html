       pam_selinux - PAM module to set the default security context

SYNOPSIS </h2>

       <b>pam_selinux.so </b>[open] [close] [restore] [nottys] [debug]
                      [verbose] [select_context] [env_params]

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       pam_selinux is a PAM module that sets up the default SELinux
       security context for the next executed process.

       When a new session is started, the open_session part of the
       module computes and sets up the execution security context used
       for the next <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> call, the file security context for the
       controlling terminal, and the security context used for creating
       a new kernel keyring.

       When the session is ended, the close_session part of the module
       restores old security contexts that were in effect before the
       change made by the open_session part of the module.

       Adding pam_selinux into the PAM stack might disrupt behavior of
       other PAM modules which execute applications. To avoid that,
       <i>pam_selinux.so open</i> should be placed after such modules in the
       PAM stack, and <i>pam_selinux.so close</i> should be placed before them.
       When such a placement is not feasible, <i>pam_selinux.so restore</i>
       could be used to temporary restore original security contexts.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>open</b>
           Only execute the open_session part of the module.

       <b>close</b>
           Only execute the close_session part of the module.

       <b>restore</b>
           In open_session part of the module, temporarily restore the
           security contexts as they were before the previous call of
           the module. Another call of this module without the restore
           option will set up the new security contexts again.

       <b>nottys</b>
           Do not setup security context of the controlling terminal.

       <b>debug</b>
           Turn on debug messages via <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.

       <b>verbose</b>
           Attempt to inform the user when security context is set.

       <b>select_context</b>
           Attempt to ask the user for a custom security context role.
           If MLS is on, ask also for sensitivity level.

       <b>env_params</b>
           Attempt to obtain a custom security context role from PAM
           environment. If MLS is on, obtain also sensitivity level.
           This option and the select_context option are mutually
           exclusive. The respective PAM environment variables are
           <i>SELINUX_ROLE_REQUESTED</i>, <i>SELINUX_LEVEL_REQUESTED</i>, and
           <i>SELINUX_USE_CURRENT_RANGE</i>. The first two variables are self
           describing and the last one if set to 1 makes the PAM module
           behave as if the use_current_range was specified on the
           command line of the module.

       <b>use_current_range</b>
           Use the sensitivity level of the current process for the user
           context instead of the default level. Also suppresses asking
           of the sensitivity level from the user or obtaining it from
           PAM environment.
