NAME </h2>
<pre>
       umount.nfs, umount.nfs4 - unmount a Network File System
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>umount.nfs </b><i>dir</i> <b>[-fvnrlh ]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>umount.nfs </b>and <b>umount.nfs4 </b>are a part of <a href="../man5/nfs.5.html">nfs(5)</a> utilities
       package, which provides NFS client functionality.

       <b>umount.nfs4 </b>and <b>umount.nfs </b>are meant to be used by the <a href="umount.8.html">umount(8)</a>
       command for unmounting NFS shares. This subcommand, however, can
       also be used as a standalone command with limited functionality.

       <i>dir</i> is the directory on which the file system is mounted.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-f     </b>Force unmount the file system in case of unreachable NFS
              system.

       <b>-v     </b>Be verbose.

       <b>-n     </b>Do not update <i>/etc/mtab.</i>  By default, an entry is created
              in <i>/etc/mtab</i> for every mounted file system. Use this
              option to skip deleting an entry.

       <b>-r     </b>In case unmounting fails, try to mount read-only.

       <b>-l     </b>Lazy unmount. Detach the file system from the file system
              hierarchy now, and cleanup all references to the file
              system as soon as it is not busy anymore.

       <b>-h     </b>Print help message.
