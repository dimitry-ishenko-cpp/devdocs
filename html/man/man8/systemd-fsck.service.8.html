DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-fsck@.service, systemd-fsck-root.service, and
       systemd-fsck-usr.service are services responsible for file system
       checks. They are instantiated for each device that is configured
       for file system checking.  systemd-fsck-root.service and
       systemd-fsck-usr.service are responsible for file system checks
       on the root and /usr file system, respectively, but only if the
       root filesystem was not checked in the initrd.
       systemd-fsck@.service is used for all other file systems and for
       the root file system in the initrd.

       These services are started at boot if <b>passno </b>in /etc/fstab for
       the file system is set to a value greater than zero, but only if
       it is also configured to be mounted at boot (i.e. without
       "noauto" option). The file system check for root is performed
       before the other file systems. Other file systems may be checked
       in parallel, except when they are on the same rotating disk.

       systemd-fsck does not know any details about specific
       filesystems, and simply executes file system checkers specific to
       each filesystem type (fsck.<i>type</i>). These checkers will decide if
       the filesystem should actually be checked based on the time since
       last check, number of mounts, unclean unmount, etc.

       systemd-fsck-root.service and systemd-fsck-usr.service will
       activate reboot.target if <b>fsck </b>returns the "System should reboot"
       condition, or emergency.target if <b>fsck </b>returns the "Filesystem
       errors left uncorrected" condition.

       systemd-fsck@.service will fail if <b>fsck </b>returns with either
       "System should reboot" or "Filesystem errors left uncorrected"
       conditions. For filesystems listed in /etc/fstab without "nofail"
       or "noauto" options, "local-fs.target" will then activate
       emergency.target.
</pre> <h2>
KERNEL COMMAND LINE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-fsck </b>understands these kernel command line parameters:

       <i>fsck.mode=</i>
           One of "auto", "force", "skip". Controls the mode of
           operation. The default is "auto", and ensures that file
           system checks are done when the file system checker deems
           them necessary.  "force" unconditionally results in full file
           system checks.  "skip" skips any file system checks.

           Added in version 186.

       <i>fsck.repair=</i>
           One of "preen", "yes", "no". Controls the mode of operation.
           The default is "preen", and will automatically repair
           problems that can be safely fixed.  "yes" will answer yes to
           all questions by fsck and "no" will answer no to all
           questions.

           Added in version 213.
