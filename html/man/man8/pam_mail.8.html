</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_mail - Inform about available mail
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_mail.so </b>[close] [debug] [dir=<i>maildir</i>] [empty] [hash=<i>count</i>]
                   [noenv] [nopen] [quiet] [standard]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_mail PAM module provides the "you have new mail" service
       to the user. It can be plugged into any application that has
       credential or session hooks. It gives a single message indicating
       the <i>newness</i> of any mail it finds in the user's mail folder. This
       module also sets the PAM environment variable, <b>MAIL</b>, to the
       user's mail directory.

       If the mail spool file (be it /var/mail/$USER or a pathname given
       with the <b>dir= </b>parameter) is a directory then pam_mail assumes it
       is in the <i>Maildir</i> format.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>close</b>
           Indicate if the user has any mail also on logout.

       <b>debug</b>
           Print debug information.

       <b>dir=</b><i>maildir</i>
           Look for the user's mail in an alternative location defined
           by maildir/&lt;login&gt;. The default location for mail is
           /var/mail/&lt;login&gt;. Note, if the supplied maildir is prefixed
           by a '~', the directory is interpreted as indicating a file
           in the user's home directory.

       <b>empty</b>
           Also print message if user has no mail.

       <b>hash=</b><i>count</i>
           Mail directory hash depth. For example, a <i>hashcount</i> of 2
           would make the mail file be /var/spool/mail/u/s/user.

       <b>noenv</b>
           Do not set the <b>MAIL </b>environment variable.

       <b>nopen</b>
           Don't print any mail information on login. This flag is
           useful to get the <b>MAIL </b>environment variable set, but to not
           display any information about it.

       <b>quiet</b>
           Only report when there is new mail.

       <b>standard</b>
           Old style "You have..." format which doesn't show the mail
           spool being used. This also implies "empty".
</pre> <h2>
