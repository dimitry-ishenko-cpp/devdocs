NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-oomd.service, systemd-oomd - A userspace out-of-memory
       (OOM) killer
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-oomd.service

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-oomd
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-oomd </b>is a system service that uses cgroups-v2 and
       pressure stall information (PSI) to monitor and take corrective
       action before an OOM occurs in the kernel space.

       You can enable monitoring and actions on units by setting
       <i>ManagedOOMSwap=</i> and <i>ManagedOOMMemoryPressure=</i> in the unit
       configuration, see <a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)</a>.  <b>systemd-oomd</b>
       retrieves information about such units from <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> when it
       starts and watches for subsequent changes.

       Cgroups of units with <i>ManagedOOMSwap=</i> or
       <i>ManagedOOMMemoryPressure=</i> set to <b>kill </b>will be monitored.
       <b>systemd-oomd </b>periodically polls PSI statistics for the system and
       those cgroups to decide when to take action. If the configured
       limits are exceeded, <b>systemd-oomd </b>will select a cgroup to
       terminate, and send <b>SIGKILL </b>to all processes in it. Note that
       only descendant cgroups are eligible candidates for killing; the
       unit with its property set to <b>kill </b>is not a candidate (unless one
       of its ancestors set their property to <b>kill</b>). Also only leaf
       cgroups and cgroups with memory.oom.group set to <b>1 </b>are eligible
       candidates; see <i>OOMPolicy=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>.

       <a href="../man1/oomctl.1.html">oomctl(1)</a> can be used to list monitored cgroups and pressure
       information.

       See <a href="../man5/oomd.conf.5.html">oomd.conf(5)</a> for more information about the configuration of
       this service.
</pre> <h2>
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The system must be running systemd with a full unified cgroup
       hierarchy for the expected cgroups-v2 features. Furthermore,
       memory accounting must be turned on for all units monitored by
       <b>systemd-oomd</b>. The easiest way to turn on memory accounting is by
       ensuring the value for <i>DefaultMemoryAccounting=</i> is set to <b>true </b>in
       <a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)</a>.

       The kernel must be compiled with PSI support. This is available
       in Linux 4.20 and above.

       It is highly recommended for the system to have swap enabled for
       <b>systemd-oomd </b>to function optimally. With swap enabled, the system
       spends enough time swapping pages to let <b>systemd-oomd </b>react.
       Without swap, the system enters a livelocked state much more
       quickly and may prevent <b>systemd-oomd </b>from responding in a
       reasonable amount of time. See <b>"In defence of swap: common</b>
       <b>misconceptions"</b>[1] for more details on swap. Any swap-based
       actions on systems without swap will be ignored. While
       <b>systemd-oomd </b>can perform pressure-based actions on such a system,
       the pressure increases will be more abrupt and may require more
       tuning to get the desired thresholds and behavior.

       Be aware that if you intend to enable monitoring and actions on
       user.slice, user-$UID.slice, or their ancestor cgroups, it is
       highly recommended that your programs be managed by the systemd
       user manager to prevent running too many processes under the same
       session scope (and thus avoid a situation where memory intensive
       tasks trigger <b>systemd-oomd </b>to kill everything under the cgroup).
       If you're using a desktop environment like GNOME or KDE, it
       already spawns many session components with the systemd user
       manager.
</pre> <h2>
USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>ManagedOOMSwap=</i> works with the system-wide swap values, so
       setting it on the root slice -.slice, and allowing all descendant
       cgroups to be eligible candidates may make the most sense.

       <i>ManagedOOMMemoryPressure=</i> tends to work better on the cgroups
       below the root slice. For units which tend to have processes that
       are less latency sensitive (e.g.  system.slice), a higher limit
       like the default of 60% may be acceptable, as those processes can
       usually ride out slowdowns caused by lack of memory without
       serious consequences. However, something like user@$UID.service
       may prefer a much lower value like 40%.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--dry-run</b>
           Do a dry run of <b>systemd-oomd</b>: when a kill is triggered, print
           it to the log instead of killing the cgroup.

           Added in version 253.

           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.
