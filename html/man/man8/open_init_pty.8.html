SYNOPSIS </h2>

       <b>open_init_pty </b><i>SCRIPT</i> [[<i>ARGS</i>]...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Run a program under a pseudo terminal. This is used by <b>run_init</b>
       to run actually run the program after setting up the proper
       context. This program acquires a new Pseudo terminal, forks a
       child process that binds to the pseudo terminal, and then sits
       around and connects the physical terminal it was invoked upon
       with the pseudo terminal, passing keyboard input into to the
       child process, and passing the output of the child process to the
       physical terminal.

       It sets up the pseudo terminal properly based on the physical
       terminal attributes, and then sets the user's terminal to RAW
       mode, taking care to reset it on exit.
