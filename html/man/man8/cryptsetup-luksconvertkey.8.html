NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cryptsetup-luksConvertKey - converts an existing LUKS2 keyslot to
       new PBKDF parameters
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cryptsetup </b><i>luksConvertKey</i> <b>[&lt;options&gt;] &lt;device&gt;</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Converts an existing LUKS2 keyslot to new PBKDF parameters. The
       passphrase for keyslot to be converted must be supplied
       interactively or via --key-file. If no --pbkdf parameters are
       specified LUKS2 default PBKDF values will apply.

       If a keyslot is specified (via --key-slot), the passphrase for
       that keyslot must be given. If no keyslot is specified and there
       is still a free keyslot, then the new parameters will be put into
       a free keyslot before the keyslot containing the old parameters
       is purged. If there is no free keyslot, then the keyslot with the
       old parameters is overwritten directly.

       <b>WARNING: </b>If a keyslot is overwritten, a media failure during this
       operation can cause the overwrite to fail after the old
       parameters have been wiped and make the LUKS container
       inaccessible.

       <b>&lt;options&gt; </b>can be [--key-file, --keyfile-offset, --keyfile-size,
       --key-slot, --hash, --header, --disable-locks, --iter-time,
       --pbkdf, --pbkdf-force-iterations, --pbkdf-memory,
       --pbkdf-parallel, --keyslot-cipher, --keyslot-key-size,
       --timeout, --verify-passphrase].
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--batch-mode, -q</b>
           Suppresses all confirmation questions. Use with care!

           If the --verify-passphrase option is not specified, this
           option also switches off the passphrase verification.

       <b>--debug or --debug-json</b>
           Run in debug mode with full diagnostic logs. Debug output
           lines are always prefixed by <b>#</b>.

           If --debug-json is used, additional LUKS2 JSON data
           structures are printed.

       <b>--disable-locks</b>
           Disable lock protection for metadata on disk. This option is
           valid only for LUKS2 and ignored for other formats.

           <b>WARNING: </b>Do not use this option unless you run cryptsetup in
           a restricted environment where locking is impossible to
           perform (where /run directory cannot be used).

       <b>--force-password</b>
           Do not use password quality checking for new LUKS passwords.

           This option is ignored if cryptsetup is built without
           password quality checking support.

           For more info about password quality check, see the manual
           page for <b>pwquality.conf</b>(5) and <b>passwdqc.conf</b>(5).

       <b>--hash, -h </b><i>&lt;hash-spec&gt;</i>
           The specified hash is used for PBKDF2 and AF splitter.

       <b>--header &lt;device or file storing the LUKS header&gt;</b>
           Use a detached (separated) metadata device or file where the
           LUKS header is stored. This option allows one to store
           ciphertext and LUKS header on different devices.

           For commands that change the LUKS header (e.g. <i>luksAddKey</i>),
           specify the device or file with the LUKS header directly as
           the LUKS device.

       <b>--help, -?</b>
           Show help text and default parameters.

       <b>--iter-time, -i &lt;number of milliseconds&gt;</b>
           The number of milliseconds to spend with PBKDF passphrase
           processing. Specifying 0 as parameter selects the compiled-in
           default.

       <b>--key-file, -d </b><i>name</i>
           Read the passphrase from file.

           If the name given is "-", then the passphrase will be read
           from stdin. In this case, reading will not stop at newline
           characters.

           See section <i>NOTES ON PASSPHRASE PROCESSING</i> in <a href="cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a>
           for more information.

       <b>--keyfile-offset </b><i>value</i>
           Skip <i>value</i> bytes at the beginning of the key file.

       <b>--keyfile-size, -l </b><i>value</i>
           Read a maximum of <i>value</i> bytes from the key file. The default
           is to read the whole file up to the compiled-in maximum that
           can be queried with --help. Supplying more data than the
           compiled-in maximum aborts the operation.

           This option is useful to cut trailing newlines, for example.
           If --keyfile-offset is also given, the size count starts
           after the offset.

       <b>--key-slot, -S &lt;0-N&gt;</b>
           For LUKS operations that add key material, this option allows
           you to specify which key slot is selected for the new key.

           The maximum number of key slots depends on the LUKS version.
           LUKS1 can have up to 8 key slots. LUKS2 can have up to 32 key
           slots based on key slot area size and key size, but a valid
           key slot ID can always be between 0 and 31 for LUKS2.

       <b>--keyslot-cipher &lt;cipher-spec&gt;</b>
           This option can be used to set specific cipher encryption for
           the LUKS2 keyslot area.

       <b>--keyslot-key-size &lt;bits&gt;</b>
           This option can be used to set specific key size for the
           LUKS2 keyslot area.

       <b>--new-keyfile-offset </b><i>value</i>
           Skip <i>value</i> bytes at the start when adding a new passphrase
           from key file.

       <b>--new-keyfile-size </b><i>value</i>
           Read a maximum of <i>value</i> bytes when adding a new passphrase
           from key file. The default is to read the whole file up to
           the compiled-in maximum length that can be queried with
           --help. Supplying more than the compiled in maximum aborts
           the operation. When --new-keyfile-offset is also given,
           reading starts after the offset.

       <b>--pbkdf &lt;PBKDF spec&gt;</b>
           Set Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) algorithm
           for LUKS keyslot. The PBKDF can be: <i>pbkdf2</i> (for PBKDF2
           according to RFC2898), <i>argon2i</i> for Argon2i or <i>argon2id</i> for
           Argon2id (see Argon2
           &lt;<a href="https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Argon2">https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Argon2</a>&gt; for more info).

           For LUKS1, only PBKDF2 is accepted (no need to use this
           option). The default PBKDF for LUKS2 is set during
           compilation time and is available in <i>cryptsetup --help</i>
           output.

           A PBKDF is used for increasing dictionary and brute-force
           attack cost for keyslot passwords. The parameters can be
           time, memory and parallel cost.

           For PBKDF2, only time cost (number of iterations) applies.
           For Argon2i/id, there is also memory cost (memory required
           during the process of key derivation) and parallel cost
           (number of threads that run in parallel during the key
           derivation.

           Note that increasing memory cost also increases time, so the
           final parameter values are measured by a benchmark. The
           benchmark tries to find iteration time (<i>--iter-time</i>) with
           required memory cost <i>--pbkdf-memory</i>. If it is not possible,
           the memory cost is decreased as well. The parallel cost
           <i>--pbkdf-parallel</i> is constant and is checked against available
           CPU cores.

           You can see all PBKDF parameters for particular LUKS2 keyslot
           with <a href="cryptsetup-luksdump.8.html">cryptsetup-luksDump(8)</a> command.

           <b>NOTE: </b>If you do not want to use benchmark and want to specify
           all parameters directly, use <i>--pbkdf-force-iterations</i> with
           <i>--pbkdf-memory</i> and <i>--pbkdf-parallel</i>. This will override the
           values without benchmarking. Note it can cause extremely long
           unlocking time or cause out-of-memory conditions with
           unconditional process termination. Use only in specific
           cases, for example, if you know that the formatted device
           will be used on some small embedded system.

           <b>MINIMAL AND MAXIMAL PBKDF COSTS: </b>For <b>PBKDF2</b>, the minimum
           iteration count is 1000 and maximum is 4294967295 (maximum
           for 32bit unsigned integer). Memory and parallel costs are
           unused for PBKDF2. For <b>Argon2i </b>and <b>Argon2id</b>, minimum
           iteration count (CPU cost) is 4 and maximum is 4294967295
           (maximum for 32bit unsigned integer). Minimum memory cost is
           32 KiB and maximum is 4 GiB. (Limited by addressable memory
           on some CPU platforms.) If the memory cost parameter is
           benchmarked (not specified by a parameter) it is always in
           range from 64 MiB to 1 GiB. The parallel cost minimum is 1
           and maximum 4 (if enough CPUs cores are available, otherwise
           it is decreased).

       <b>--pbkdf-force-iterations &lt;num&gt;</b>
           Avoid PBKDF benchmark and set time cost (iterations)
           directly. It can be used for LUKS/LUKS2 device only. See
           <i>--pbkdf</i> option for more info.

       <b>--pbkdf-memory &lt;number&gt;</b>
           Set the memory cost for PBKDF (for Argon2i/id the number
           represents kilobytes). Note that it is maximal value, PBKDF
           benchmark or available physical memory can decrease it. This
           option is not available for PBKDF2.

       <b>--pbkdf-parallel &lt;number&gt;</b>
           Set the parallel cost for PBKDF (number of threads, up to 4).
           Note that it is maximal value, it is decreased automatically
           if CPU online count is lower. This option is not available
           for PBKDF2.

       <b>--timeout, -t &lt;number of seconds&gt;</b>
           The number of seconds to wait before timeout on passphrase
           input via terminal. It is relevant every time a passphrase is
           asked. It has no effect if used in conjunction with
           --key-file.

           This option is useful when the system should not stall if the
           user does not input a passphrase, e.g. during boot. The
           default is a value of 0 seconds, which means to wait forever.

       <b>--usage</b>
           Show short option help.

       <b>--verify-passphrase, -y</b>
           When interactively asking for a passphrase, ask for it twice
           and complain if both inputs do not match. Ignored on input
           from file or stdin.

       <b>--version, -V</b>
           Show the program version.
