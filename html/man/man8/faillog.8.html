</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       faillog - display faillog records or set login failure limits
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>faillog </b>[<i>options</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>faillog </b>displays the contents of the failure log database
       (/var/log/faillog). It can also set the failure counters and
       limits. When <b>faillog </b>is run without arguments, it only displays
       the faillog records of the users who had a login failure.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The options which apply to the <b>faillog </b>command are:

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Display (or act on) faillog records for all users having an
           entry in the faillog database.

           The range of users can be restricted with the <b>-u </b>option.

           In display mode, this is still restricted to existing users
           but forces the display of the faillog entries even if they
           are empty.

           With the <b>-l</b>, <b>-m</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-t </b>options, the users' records are
           changed, even if the user does not exist on the system. This
           is useful to reset records of users that have been deleted or
           to set a policy in advance for a range of users.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help message and exit.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--lock-secs </b><i>SEC</i>
           Lock account for <i>SEC</i> seconds after failed login.

           Write access to /var/log/faillog is required for this option.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--maximum </b><i>MAX</i>
           Set the maximum number of login failures after the account is
           disabled to <i>MAX</i>.

           Selecting a <i>MAX</i> value of 0 has the effect of not placing a
           limit on the number of failed logins.

           The maximum failure count should always be 0 for <i>root</i> to
           prevent a denial of services attack against the system.

           Write access to /var/log/faillog is required for this option.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--reset</b>
           Reset the counters of login failures.

           Write access to /var/log/faillog is required for this option.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root </b><i>CHROOT_DIR</i>
           Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use the
           configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only
           absolute paths are supported.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--time </b><i>DAYS</i>
           Display faillog records more recent than <i>DAYS</i>.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user </b><i>LOGIN</i>|<i>RANGE</i>
           Display faillog record or maintains failure counters and
           limits (if used with <b>-l</b>, <b>-m </b>or <b>-r </b>options) only for the
           specified user(s).

           The users can be specified by a login name, a numerical user
           ID, or a <i>RANGE</i> of users. This <i>RANGE</i> of users can be specified
           with a min and max values (<i>UID_MIN-UID_MAX</i>), a max value
           (<i>-UID_MAX</i>), or a min value (<i>UID_MIN-</i>).

       When none of the <b>-l</b>, <b>-m</b>, or <b>-r </b>options are used, <b>faillog </b>displays
       the faillog record of the specified user(s).
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>faillog </b>only prints out users with no successful login since the
       last failure. To print out a user who has had a successful login
       since their last failure, you must explicitly request the user
       with the <b>-u </b>flag, or print out all users with the <b>-a </b>flag.
</pre> <h2>
