NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rpm-plugins - Plugins for the RPM Package Manager
</pre> <h2>
Description </h2>
<pre>
       RPM plugins provide functionality that is not suited to be used
       everywhere.  They may not be built or shipped on some platforms
       or may not be installed or be disabled on some systems.

       This allows plugins to interface with systems that may not ac‐
       ceptable as a dependency for RPM and to provide functionality
       that may be unwanted under some circumstances.

       For now the plugin API is internal only.  So there is a limited
       number of plugins in the RPM sources.
</pre> <h2>
Configuration </h2>
<pre>
       Some plugins can be configured by specific macros or influenced
       by command line parameters.  But most can only be turned on or
       off.  See the plugin's man page for details.

       Plugins are controlled by a macro <i>%__transaction_NAME</i> which is
       set to the location of the plugin file.  Undefining the macro or
       setting it to <i>%{nil}</i> will prevent the plugin from being run.

       This can be done on the RPM command line e.g. with <b>--unde‐</b>
       <b>fine=__transaction_syslog</b>.  To disable a plugin permantently drop
       a file in <i>/etc/rpm/</i> that contains

       __transaction_NAME %{nil}

       Another option is to remove the plugin from the system if it is
       packaged in its own sub package.

       For some operations it may be desirable to disable all plugins at
       once.  This can be done by passing <b>--noplugins </b>to <b>rpm </b>at the com‐
       mand line.
