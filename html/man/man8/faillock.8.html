</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       faillock - Tool for displaying and modifying the authentication
       failure record files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>faillock </b>[--dir <i>/path/to/tally-directory</i>] [--user <i>username</i>]
                [--reset]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pam_faillock.so</i> module maintains a list of failed
       authentication attempts per user during a specified interval and
       locks the account in case there were more than <i>deny</i> consecutive
       failed authentications. It stores the failure records into
       per-user files in the tally directory.

       The <b>faillock </b>command is an application which can be used to
       examine and modify the contents of the tally files. It can
       display the recent failed authentication attempts of the <i>username</i>
       or clear the tally files of all or individual <i>usernames</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--conf </b><i>/path/to/config-file</i>
           The file where the configuration is located. The default is
           /etc/security/faillock.conf.

       <b>--dir </b><i>/path/to/tally-directory</i>
           The directory where the user files with the failure records
           are kept.

           The priority to set this option is to use the value provided
           from the command line. If this isn't provided, then the value
           from the configuration file is used. Finally, if neither of
           them has been provided, then /var/run/faillock is used.

       <b>--user </b><i>username</i>
           The user whose failure records should be displayed or
           cleared.

       <b>--reset</b>
           Instead of displaying the user's failure records, clear them.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /var/run/faillock/*
