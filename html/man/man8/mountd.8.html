NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rpc.mountd - NFS mount daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/usr/sbin/rpc.mountd [</b><i>options</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>rpc.mountd </b>daemon implements the server side of the NFS MOUNT
       protocol, an NFS side protocol used by NFS version 2 [RFC1094]
       and NFS version 3 [RFC1813].  It also responds to requests from
       the Linux kernel to authenticate clients and provides details of
       access permissions.

       The NFS server (<i>nfsd</i>) maintains a cache of authentication and
       authorization information which is used to identify the source of
       each request, and then what access permissions that source has to
       any local filesystem.  When required information is not found in
       the cache, the server sends a request to <b>mountd </b>to fill in the
       missing information.  Mountd uses a table of information stored
       in <b>/var/lib/nfs/etab </b>and maintained by <a href="exportfs.8.html">exportfs(8)</a>, possibly
       based on the contents of <a href="../man5/exports.5.html">exports(5)</a>, to respond to each request.

   <b>Mounting exported NFS File Systems</b>
       The NFS MOUNT protocol has several procedures.  The most
       important of these are MNT (mount an export) and UMNT (unmount an
       export).

       A MNT request has two arguments: an explicit argument that
       contains the pathname of the root directory of the export to be
       mounted, and an implicit argument that is the sender's IP
       address.

       When receiving a MNT request from an NFS client, <b>rpc.mountd</b>
       checks both the pathname and the sender's IP address against its
       export table.  If the sender is permitted to access the requested
       export, <b>rpc.mountd </b>returns an NFS file handle for the export's
       root directory to the client.  The client can then use the root
       file handle and NFS LOOKUP requests to navigate the directory
       structure of the export.

   <b>The rmtab File</b>
       The <b>rpc.mountd </b>daemon registers every successful MNT request by
       adding an entry to the <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i> file.  When receivng a
       UMNT request from an NFS client, <b>rpc.mountd </b>simply removes the
       matching entry from <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i>, as long as the access
       control list for that export allows that sender to access the
       export.

       Clients can discover the list of file systems an NFS server is
       currently exporting, or the list of other clients that have
       mounted its exports, by using the <a href="showmount.8.html">showmount(8)</a> command.
       <a href="showmount.8.html">showmount(8)</a> uses other procedures in the NFS MOUNT protocol to
       report information about the server's exported file systems.

       Note, however, that there is little to guarantee that the
       contents of <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i> are accurate.  A client may
       continue accessing an export even after invoking UMNT.  If the
       client reboots without sending a UMNT request, stale entries
       remain for that client in <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i>.

   <b>Mounting File Systems with NFSv4</b>
       Version 4 (and later) of NFS does not use a separate NFS MOUNT
       protocol.  Instead mounting is performed using regular NFS
       requests handled by the NFS server in the Linux kernel (<i>nfsd</i>).
       Consequently <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i> is not updated to reflect any
       NFSv4 activity.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d kind  or  --debug kind</b>
              Turn on debugging. Valid kinds are: all, auth, call,
              general and parse.

       <b>-l </b>or <b>--log-auth</b>
              Enable logging of responses to authentication and access
              requests from nfsd.  Each response is then cached by the
              kernel for 30 minutes (or as set by <b>--ttl </b>below), and will
              be refreshed after 15 minutes (half the ttl time) if the
              relevant client remains active.  Note that <b>-l </b>is
              equivalent to <b>-d auth </b>and so can be enabled in
              <b>/etc/nfs.conf </b>with <b>"debug = auth" </b>in the <b>[mountd] </b>section.

              <b>rpc.mountd </b>will always log authentication responses to
              MOUNT requests when NFSv3 is used, but to get similar logs
              for NFSv4, this option is required.

       <b>-i </b>or <b>--cache-use-ipaddr</b>
              Normally each client IP address is matched against each
              host identifier (name, wildcard, netgroup etc) found in
              <b>/etc/exports </b>and a combined identity is formed from all
              matching identifiers.  Often many clients will map to the
              same combined identity so performing this mapping reduces
              the number of distinct access details that the kernel
              needs to store.  Specifying the <b>-i </b>option suppresses this
              mapping so that access to each filesystem is requested and
              cached separately for each client IP address.  Doing this
              can increase the burden of updating the cache slightly,
              but can make the log messages produced by the <b>-l </b>option
              easier to read.

       <b>-T  or  --ttl</b>
              Provide a time-to-live (TTL) for cached information given
              to the kernel.  The kernel will normally request an update
              if the information is needed after half of this time has
              expired.  Increasing the provided number, which is in
              seconds, reduces the rate of cache update requests, and
              this is particularly noticeable when these requests are
              logged with <b>-l</b>.  However increasing also means that
              changes to hostname to address mappings can take longer to
              be noticed.  The default TTL is 1800 (30 minutes).

       <b>-F  or  --foreground</b>
              Run in foreground (do not daemonize)

       <b>-h  or  --help</b>
              Display usage message.

       <b>-o num  or  --descriptors num</b>
              Set the limit of the number of open file descriptors to
              num. The default is to leave the limit unchanged.

       <b>-N mountd-version  or  --no-nfs-version mountd-version</b>
              This option can be used to request that <b>rpc.mountd </b>do not
              offer certain versions of NFS. The current version of
              <b>rpc.mountd </b>can support both NFS version 2, 3 and 4. If the
              either one of these version should not be offered,
              <b>rpc.mountd </b>must be invoked with the option <b>--no-nfs-</b>
              <b>version &lt;vers&gt; .</b>

       <b>-n  or  --no-tcp</b>
              Don't advertise TCP for mount.

       <b>-p num  or  -P num  or  --port num</b>
              Specifies the port number used for RPC listener sockets.
              If this option is not specified, <b>rpc.mountd </b>will try to
              consult <i>/etc/services</i>, if gets port succeed, set the same
              port for all listener socket, otherwise chooses a random
              ephemeral port for each listener socket.

              This option can be used to fix the port value of
              <b>rpc.mountd</b>'s listeners when NFS MOUNT requests must
              traverse a firewall between clients and servers.

       <b>-H  prog or  --ha-callout prog</b>
              Specify a high availability callout program.  This program
              receives callouts for all MOUNT and UNMOUNT requests.
              This allows <b>rpc.mountd </b>to be used in a High Availability
              NFS (HA-NFS) environment.

              The callout program is run with 4 arguments.  The first is
              <b>mount </b>or <b>unmount </b>depending on the reason for the callout.
              The second will be the name of the client performing the
              mount.  The third will be the path that the client is
              mounting.  The last is the number of concurrent mounts
              that we believe the client has of that path.

              This callout is not needed with 2.6 and later kernels.
              Instead, mount the nfsd filesystem on <i>/proc/fs/nfsd</i>.

       <b>-s, --state-directory-path </b><i>directory</i>
              Specify a directory in which to place state information
              (etab and rmtab).  If this option is not specified the
              default of <i>/var/lib/nfs</i> is used.

       <b>-r, --reverse-lookup</b>
              <b>rpc.mountd </b>tracks IP addresses in the <i>rmtab</i> file.  When a
              DUMP request is made (by someone running <b>showmount -a</b>, for
              instance), it returns IP addresses instead of hostnames by
              default. This option causes <b>rpc.mountd </b>to perform a
              reverse lookup on each IP address and return that hostname
              instead.  Enabling this can have a substantial negative
              effect on performance in some situations.

       <b>-t N </b>or <b>--num-threads=N </b>or <b>--num-threads N</b>
              This option specifies the number of worker threads that
              rpc.mountd spawns.  The default is 1 thread, which is
              probably enough.  More threads are usually only needed for
              NFS servers which need to handle mount storms of hundreds
              of NFS mounts in a few seconds, or when your DNS server is
              slow or unreliable.

       <b>-u  or  --no-udp</b>
              Don't advertise UDP for mounting

       <b>-V version  or  --nfs-version version</b>
              This option can be used to request that <b>rpc.mountd </b>offer
              certain versions of NFS. The current version of <b>rpc.mountd</b>
              can support both NFS version 2 and the newer version 3.

       <b>-v  or  --version</b>
              Print the version of <b>rpc.mountd </b>and exit.

       <b>-g  or  --manage-gids</b>
              Accept requests from the kernel to map user id numbers
              into  lists of group id numbers for use in access control.
              An NFS request will normally (except when using Kerberos
              or other cryptographic authentication) contains a user-id
              and a list of group-ids.  Due to a limitation in the NFS
              protocol, at most 16 groups ids can be listed.  If you use
              the <b>-g </b>flag, then the list of group ids received from the
              client will be replaced by a list of group ids determined
              by an appropriate lookup on the server. Note that the
              'primary' group id is not affected so a <b>newgroup </b>command
              on the client will still be effective.  This function
              requires a Linux Kernel with version at least 2.6.21.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE </h2>
<pre>
       Many of the options that can be set on the command line can also
       be controlled through values set in the <b>[mountd] </b>or, in some
       cases, the <b>[nfsd] </b>sections of the <i>/etc/nfs.conf</i> configuration
       file.  Values recognized in the <b>[mountd] </b>section include <b>manage-</b>
       <b>gids</b>, <b>cache-use-ipaddr</b>, <b>descriptors</b>, <b>port</b>, <b>threads</b>, <b>ttl</b>, <b>reverse-</b>
       <b>lookup</b>, and <b>state-directory-path</b>, <b>ha-callout </b>which each have the
       same effect as the option with the same name.

       The values recognized in the <b>[nfsd] </b>section include <b>TCP</b>, <b>UDP</b>,
       <b>vers3</b>, and <b>vers4 </b>which each have the same meaning as given by
       <a href="rpc.nfsd.8.html">rpc.nfsd(8)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
TCP_WRAPPERS SUPPORT </h2>
<pre>
       You can protect your <b>rpc.mountd </b>listeners using the <b>tcp_wrapper</b>
       library or <a href="iptables.8.html">iptables(8)</a>.

       Note that the <b>tcp_wrapper </b>library supports only IPv4 networking.

       Add the hostnames of NFS peers that are allowed to access
       <b>rpc.mountd </b>to <i>/etc/hosts.allow</i>.  Use the daemon name <b>mountd </b>even
       if the <b>rpc.mountd </b>binary has a different name.

       Hostnames used in either access file will be ignored when they
       can not be resolved into IP addresses.  For further information
       see the <b>tcpd</b>(8) and <b>hosts_access</b>(5) man pages.

   <b>IPv6 and TI-RPC support</b>
       TI-RPC is a pre-requisite for supporting NFS on IPv6.  If TI-RPC
       support is built into <b>rpc.mountd</b>, it attempts to start listeners
       on network transports marked 'visible' in <i>/etc/netconfig</i>.  As
       long as at least one network transport listener starts
       successfully, <b>rpc.mountd </b>will operate.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/exports</i>
              input file for <b>exportfs</b>, listing exports, export options,
              and access control lists

       <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i>
              table of clients accessing server's exports
