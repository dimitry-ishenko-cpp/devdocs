NAME </h2>

       mariadbd - the MariaDB server (mysqld is now a symlink to
       mariadbd)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>mysqld [</b><i>options</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mysqld</b>, also known as MariaDB Server, is the main program that
       does most of the work in a MariaDB installation. MariaDB Server
       manages access to the MariaDB data directory that contains
       databases and tables. The data directory is also the default
       location for other information such as log files and status
       files.

       When MariaDB server starts, it listens for network connections
       from client programs and manages access to databases on behalf of
       those clients.

       The <b>mysqld </b>program has many options that can be specified at
       startup. For a complete list of options, run this command:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqld --verbose --help</b>

       MariaDB Server also has a set of system variables that affect its
       operation as it runs. System variables can be set at server
       startup, and many of them can be changed at runtime to effect
       dynamic server reconfiguration. MariaDB Server also has a set of
       status variables that provide information about its operation.
       You can monitor these status variables to access runtime
       performance characteristics.

       For a full description of MariaDB Server command options, system
       variables, and status variables, see the MariaDB Knowledge Base.
