NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lsblk - list block devices
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lsblk </b>[options] [<i>device</i>...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lsblk </b>lists information about all available or the specified
       block devices. The <b>lsblk </b>command reads the <b>sysfs </b>filesystem and
       <b>udev db </b>to gather information. If the udev db is not available or
       <b>lsblk </b>is compiled without udev support, then it tries to read
       LABELs, UUIDs and filesystem types from the block device. In this
       case root permissions are necessary.

       By default, the command prints all block devices (except RAM
       disks) in a tree-like format. The same device can be repeated in
       the tree if it relates to other devices. The <b>--merge </b>option is
       recommended for more complicated setups to gather groups of
       devices and describe complex N:M relationships.

       The tree-like output (or <b>children[] </b>array in the JSON output) is
       enabled only if NAME column it present in the output or when
       <b>--tree </b>command line option is used. See also <b>--nodeps </b>and <b>--list</b>
       to control the tree formatting.

       The default output, as well as the default output from options
       like <b>--fs </b>and <b>--topology</b>, is subject to change. So whenever
       possible, you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts.
       Always explicitly define expected columns by using <b>--output</b>
       <i>columns-list</i> and <b>--list </b>in environments where a stable output is
       required.

       Use <b>lsblk --list-columns </b>to get a list of all available columns.

       Note that <b>lsblk </b>might be executed in time when <b>udev </b>does not have
       all information about recently added or modified devices yet. In
       this case it is recommended to use <b>udevadm settle </b>before <b>lsblk </b>to
       synchronize with udev.

       The relationship between block devices and filesystems is not
       always one-to-one. The filesystem may use more block devices, or
       the same filesystem may be accessible by more paths. This is the
       reason why <b>lsblk </b>provides MOUNTPOINT and MOUNTPOINTS (pl.)
       columns. The column MOUNTPOINT displays only one mount point
       (usually the last mounted instance of the filesystem), and the
       column MOUNTPOINTS displays by multi-line cell all mount points
       associated with the device.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--noempty</b>
           Don’t print empty devices.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Disable all built-in filters and list all empty devices and
           RAM disk devices too.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--bytes</b>
           Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable
           format.

           By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and
           unit prefixes are in power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of
           symbols are exhibited truncated in order to reach a better
           readability, by exhibiting alone the first letter of them;
           examples: "1 KiB" and "1 MiB" are respectively exhibited as
           "1 K" and "1 M", then omitting on purpose the mention "iB",
           which is part of these abbreviations.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--list-columns</b>
           List the available columns, use with <b>--json </b>or <b>--raw </b>to get
           output in machine-readable format.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--discard</b>
           Print information about the discarding capabilities (TRIM,
           UNMAP) for each device.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--nodeps</b>
           Do not print holder devices or slaves. For example, <b>lsblk</b>
           <b>--nodeps /dev/sda </b>prints information about the sda device
           only.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--dedup </b><i>column</i>
           Use <i>column</i> as a de-duplication key to de-duplicate output
           tree. If the key is not available for the device, or the
           device is a partition and parental whole-disk device provides
           the same key than the device is always printed.

           The usual use case is to de-duplicate output on system
           multi-path devices, for example by <b>-E WWN</b>.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--exclude </b><i>list</i>
           Exclude the devices specified by the comma-separated <i>list</i> of
           major device numbers. Note that RAM disks (major=1) are
           excluded by default if <b>--all </b>is not specified. The filter is
           applied to the top-level devices only. This may be confusing
           for <b>--list </b>output format where hierarchy of the devices is
           not obvious.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--fs</b>
           Output info about filesystems. This option is equivalent to
           <b>-o NAME,FSTYPE,FSVER,LABEL,UUID,FSAVAIL,FSUSE%,MOUNTPOINTS</b>.
           The authoritative information about filesystems and raids is
           provided by the <a href="blkid.8.html">blkid(8)</a> command.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--include </b><i>list</i>
           Include devices specified by the comma-separated <i>list</i> of
           major device numbers. The filter is applied to the top-level
           devices only. This may be confusing for <b>--list </b>output format
           where hierarchy of the devices is not obvious.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ascii</b>
           Use ASCII characters for tree formatting.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--json</b>
           Use JSON output format. It’s strongly recommended to use
           <b>--output </b>and also <b>--tree </b>if necessary. Note that <b>children[]</b>
           is used only if NAME column or <b>--tree </b>is used.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
           Produce output in the form of a list. The output does not
           provide information about relationships between devices and
           since version 2.34 every device is printed only once if
           <b>--pairs </b>or <b>--raw </b>not specified (the parsable outputs are
           maintained in backwardly compatible way).

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--merge</b>
           Group parents of sub-trees to provide more readable output
           for RAIDs and Multi-path devices. The tree-like output is
           required.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--perms</b>
           Output info about device owner, group and mode. This option
           is equivalent to <b>-o NAME,SIZE,OWNER,GROUP,MODE</b>.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--nvme</b>
           Output info about NVMe devices only.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--virtio</b>
           Output info about virtio devices only.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noheadings</b>
           Do not print a header line.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output </b><i>list</i>
           Specify which output columns to print. Use <b>--list-columns </b>to
           get a list of all supported columns. The columns may affect
           tree-like output. The default is to use tree for the column
           'NAME' (see also <b>--tree</b>).

           The default list of columns may be extended if <i>list</i> is
           specified in the format <i>+list</i> (e.g., <b>lsblk -o +UUID</b>).

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--output-all</b>
           Output all available columns.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--pairs</b>
           Produce output in the form of key="value" pairs. The output
           lines are still ordered by dependencies. All potentially
           unsafe value characters are hex-escaped (\x&lt;code&gt;). See also
           option <b>--shell</b>.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--paths</b>
           Print full device paths.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--filter </b><i>expr</i>
           Print only the devices that meet the conditions specified by
           the expr. The filter is assessed prior to lsblk collecting
           data for all output columns. Only the necessary data for the
           lazy evaluation of the expression is retrieved from the
           system. This approach can enhance performance when compared
           to post-filtering, as commonly done by tools such as grep(1).

           This feature is EXPERIMENTAL. See also <a href="../man5/scols-filter.5.html">scols-filter(5)</a>. For
           example exclude sda  and sdb, but print everything else ('!~'
           is a negative regular expression matching operator):

              lsblk --filter 'NAME !~ "sd[ab]"'

       <b>--highlight </b><i>expr</i>
           Colorize lines matching the expression. This feature is
           EXPERIMENTAL. See also <a href="../man5/scols-filter.5.html">scols-filter(5)</a>.

       <b>--ct </b><i>name</i> [: <i>param</i> [: <i>function</i> ]]
           Define a custom counter. The counters are printed after the
           standard output. The <i>name</i> is the custom name of the counter,
           the optional <i>param</i> is the name of the column to be used for
           the counter, and the optional <i>function</i> specifies the
           aggregation function, supported functions are: count, min,
           max, or sum. The default is count.

           If the <i>param</i> is not specified, then the counter counts the
           number of lines. This feature is EXPERIMENTAL. See also
           <b>--ct-filter</b>.

           For example, <b>--ct MyCounter:SIZE:sum </b>will count the summary
           for SIZE from all lines; and to count the number of SATA
           disks, it is possible to use:

              lsblk --ct-filter 'TYPE=="disk" &amp;&amp; TRAN=="sata"' --ct "Number of SATA devices"

       <b>--ct-filter </b><i>expr</i>
           Define a restriction for the next counter. This feature is
           EXPERIMENTAL. See also <b>--ct </b>and <a href="../man5/scols-filter.5.html">scols-filter(5)</a>. For example,
           aggregate sizes by device type:

              lsblk --ct-filter 'TYPE=="part"' --ct Partitions:SIZE:sum \
                    --ct-filter 'TYPE=="disk"' --ct WholeDisks:SIZE:sum

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
           Produce output in raw format. The output lines are still
           ordered by dependencies. All potentially unsafe characters
           are hex-escaped (\x&lt;code&gt;) in the NAME, KNAME, LABEL,
           PARTLABEL and MOUNTPOINT columns.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--scsi</b>
           Output info about SCSI devices only. All partitions, slaves
           and holder devices are ignored.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--inverse</b>
           Print dependencies in inverse order. If the <b>--list </b>output is
           requested then the lines are still ordered by dependencies.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--tree</b>[<b>=</b><i>column</i>]
           Force tree-like output format. If <i>column</i> is specified, then a
           tree is printed in the column. The default is NAME column.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--topology</b>
           Output info about block-device topology. This option is
           equivalent to

           <b>-o</b>
           <b>NAME,ALIGNMENT,MIN-IO,OPT-IO,PHY-SEC,LOG-SEC,ROTA,SCHED,RQ-SIZE,RA,WSAME</b>.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--width </b><i>number</i>
           Specifies output width as a number of characters. The default
           is the number of the terminal columns, and if not executed on
           a terminal, then output width is not restricted at all by
           default. This option also forces <b>lsblk </b>to assume that
           terminal control characters and unsafe characters are not
           allowed. The expected use-case is for example when <b>lsblk </b>is
           used by the <a href="../man1/watch.1.html">watch(1)</a> command.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--sort </b><i>column</i>
           Sort output lines by <i>column</i>. This option enables <b>--list</b>
           output format by default. It is possible to use the option
           <b>--tree </b>to force tree-like output and than the tree branches
           are sorted by the <i>column</i>.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--shell</b>
           The column name will be modified to contain only characters
           allowed for shell variable identifiers, for example, MIN_IO
           and FSUSE_PCT instead of MIN-IO and FSUSE%. This is usable,
           for example, with <b>--pairs</b>. Note that this feature has been
           automatically enabled for <b>--pairs </b>in version 2.37, but due to
           compatibility issues, now it’s necessary to request this
           behavior by <b>--shell</b>.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--zoned</b>
           Print the zone related information for each device.

       <b>--sysroot </b><i>directory</i>
           Gather data for a Linux instance other than the instance from
           which the <b>lsblk </b>command is issued. The specified directory is
           the system root of the Linux instance to be inspected. The
           real device nodes in the target directory can be replaced by
           text files with udev attributes.

           enables <b>libblkid </b>debug output.

       <b>LIBMOUNT_DEBUG</b>=all
           enables <b>libmount </b>debug output.

       <b>LIBSMARTCOLS_DEBUG</b>=all
           enables <b>libsmartcols </b>debug output.

       <b>LIBSMARTCOLS_DEBUG_PADDING</b>=on

</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       For partitions, some information (e.g., queue attributes) is
       inherited from the parent device.

       The <b>lsblk </b>command needs to be able to look up each block device
       by major:minor numbers, which is done by using <i>/sys/dev/block</i>.
       This sysfs block directory appeared in kernel 2.6.27 (October
       2008). In case of problems with a new enough kernel, check that
       <b>CONFIG_SYSFS </b>was enabled at the time of the kernel build.
