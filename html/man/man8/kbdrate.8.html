NAME </h2>
<pre>
       kbdrate - reset the keyboard repeat rate and delay time
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>kbdrate </b>[<i>options</i>...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>kbdrate </b>is used to change the keyboard repeat rate and delay
       time. The delay is the amount of time that a key must be
       depressed before it will start to repeat.

       Using <b>kbdrate </b>without any options will reset the repeat rate to
       10.9 characters per second (cps) and the delay to 250
       milliseconds (ms) for Intel- and M68K-based systems.  These are
       the IBM defaults. On SPARC-based systems it will reset the repeat
       rate to 5 cps and the delay to 200 ms.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-r</b>, <b>--rate</b>=<i>NUMBER</i>
              Change the keyboard repeat rate to <i>NUMBER</i> cps. For Intel-
              based systems, the allowable range is from 2.0 to 30.0
              cps.  Only certain, specific values are possible, and the
              program will select the nearest possible value to the one
              specified. The possible values are given, in characters
              per second, as follows: 2.0, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 3.0, 3.3,
              3.7, 4.0, 4.3, 4.6, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.7, 7.5, 8.0, 8.6,
              9.2, 10.0, 10.9, 12.0, 13.3, 15.0, 16.0, 17.1, 18.5, 20.0,
              21.8, 24.0, 26.7, 30.0.  For SPARC-based systems, the
              allowable range is from 0 (no repeat) to 50 cps.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--delay</b>=<i>NUMBER</i>
              Change the delay to <i>NUMBER</i> milliseconds.  For Intel-based
              systems, the allowable range is from 250 to 1000 ms, in
              250 ms steps. For SPARC systems, possible values are
              between 10 ms and 1440 ms, in 10 ms steps.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>
              Silent. No messages are printed.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display a help text.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display a version number and exit.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Not all keyboards support all rates.

       Not all keyboards have the rates mapped in the same way.

       Setting the repeat rate on the Gateway AnyKey keyboard does not
       work.  If someone with a Gateway figures out how to program the
       keyboard, please send mail to util-linux@math.uio.no.

       All this is very architecture dependent.  Nowadays <b>kbdrate </b>first
       tries the KDKBDREP and KIOCSRATE ioctls.  (The former usually
       works on an m68k/i386 machine, the latter for SPARC.)  When these
       ioctls fail an ioport interface.
