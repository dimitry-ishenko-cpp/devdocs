</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lspci - list all PCI devices
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lspci </b>[<b>options</b>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lspci </b>is a utility for displaying information about PCI buses in
       the system and devices connected to them.

       By default, it shows a brief list of devices. Use the options
       described below to request either a more verbose output or output
       intended for parsing by other programs.

       If you are going to report bugs in PCI device drivers or in <i>lspci</i>
       itself, please include output of "lspci -vvx" or even better
       "lspci -vvxxx" (however, see below for possible caveats).

       Some parts of the output, especially in the highly verbose modes,
       are probably intelligible only to experienced PCI hackers. For
       exact definitions of the fields, please consult either the PCI
       specifications or the <b>header.h </b>and <b>/usr/include/linux/pci.h</b>
       include files.

       Access to some parts of the PCI configuration space is restricted
       to root on many operating systems, so the features of <i>lspci</i>
       available to normal users are limited. However, <i>lspci</i> tries its
       best to display as much as available and mark all other
       information with <i>&lt;access denied&gt;</i> text.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Basic display modes</b>
       <b>-m     </b>Dump PCI device data in a backward-compatible machine
              readable form.  See below for details.

       <b>-mm    </b>Dump PCI device data in a machine readable form for easy
              parsing by scripts.  See below for details.

       <b>-t     </b>Show a tree-like diagram containing all buses, bridges,
              devices and connections between them.

   <b>Display options</b>
       <b>-v     </b>Be verbose and display detailed information about all
              devices.

       <b>-vv    </b>Be very verbose and display more details. This level
              includes everything deemed useful.

       <b>-vvv   </b>Be even more verbose and display everything we are able to
              parse, even if it doesn't look interesting at all (e.g.,
              undefined memory regions).

       <b>-k     </b>Show kernel drivers handling each device and also kernel
              modules capable of handling it.  Turned on by default when
              <b>-v </b>is given in the normal mode of output.  (Currently
              works only on Linux with kernel 2.6 or newer.)

       <b>-x     </b>Show hexadecimal dump of the standard part of the
              configuration space (the first 64 bytes or 128 bytes for
              CardBus bridges).

       <b>-xxx   </b>Show hexadecimal dump of the whole PCI configuration
              space. It is available only to root as several PCI devices
              <b>crash </b>when you try to read some parts of the config space
              (this behavior probably doesn't violate the PCI standard,
              but it's at least very stupid). However, such devices are
              rare, so you needn't worry much.

       <b>-xxxx  </b>Show hexadecimal dump of the extended (4096-byte) PCI
              configuration space available on PCI-X 2.0 and PCI Express
              buses.

       <b>-b     </b>Bus-centric view. Show all IRQ numbers and addresses as
              seen by the cards on the PCI bus instead of as seen by the
              kernel.

       <b>-D     </b>Always show PCI domain numbers. By default, lspci
              suppresses them on machines which have only domain 0.

       <b>-P     </b>Identify PCI devices by path through each bridge, instead
              of by bus number.

       <b>-PP    </b>Identify PCI devices by path through each bridge, showing
              the bus number as well as the device number.

   <b>Options to control resolving ID's to names</b>
       <b>-n     </b>Show PCI vendor and device codes as numbers instead of
              looking them up in the PCI ID list.

       <b>-nn    </b>Show PCI vendor and device codes as both numbers and
              names.

       <b>-q     </b>Use DNS to query the central PCI ID database if a device
              is not found in the local <b>pci.ids </b>file. If the DNS query
              succeeds, the result is cached in <b>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pci-ids</b>
              and it is recognized in subsequent runs even if <b>-q </b>is not
              given any more. Please use this switch inside automated
              scripts only with caution to avoid overloading the
              database servers.

       <b>-qq    </b>Same as <b>-q</b>, but the local cache is reset.

       <b>-Q     </b>Query the central database even for entries which are
              recognized locally.  Use this if you suspect that the
              displayed entry is wrong.

   <b>Options for selection of devices</b>
       <b>-s [[[[&lt;domain&gt;]:]&lt;bus&gt;]:][&lt;device&gt;][.[&lt;func&gt;]]</b>
              Show only devices in the specified domain (in case your
              machine has several host bridges, they can either share a
              common bus number space or each of them can address a PCI
              domain of its own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff),
              bus (0 to ff), device (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7).
              Each component of the device address can be omitted or set
              to "*", both meaning "any value". All numbers are
              hexadecimal.  E.g., "0:" means all devices on bus 0, "0"
              means all functions of device 0 on any bus, "0.3" selects
              third function of device 0 on all buses and ".4" shows
              only the fourth function of each device.

       <b>-d [&lt;vendor&gt;]:[&lt;device&gt;][:&lt;class&gt;[:&lt;prog-if&gt;]]</b>
              Show only devices with specified vendor, device, class ID,
              and programming interface.  The ID's are given in
              hexadecimal and may be omitted or given as "*", both
              meaning "any value". The class ID can contain "x"
              characters which stand for "any digit".

   <b>Other options</b>
       <b>-i &lt;file&gt;</b>
              Use <b>&lt;file&gt; </b>as the PCI ID list instead of
              /usr/local/share/pci.ids.

       <b>-p &lt;file&gt;</b>
              Use <b>&lt;file&gt; </b>as the map of PCI ID's handled by kernel
              modules. By default, lspci uses
              /lib/modules/<i>kernel_version</i>/modules.pcimap.  Applies only
              to Linux systems with recent enough module tools.

       <b>-M     </b>Invoke bus mapping mode which performs a thorough scan of
              all PCI devices, including those behind misconfigured
              bridges, etc. This option gives meaningful results only
              with a direct hardware access mode, which usually requires
              root privileges.  By default, the bus mapper scans domain.
              You can use the <b>-s </b>option to select a different domain.

       <b>--version</b>
              Shows <i>lspci</i> version. This option should be used stand-
              alone.

   <b>PCI access options</b>
       The PCI utilities use the PCI library to talk to PCI devices (see
       <a href="../man7/pcilib.7.html">pcilib(7)</a> for details). You can use the following options to
       influence its behavior:

       <b>-A &lt;method&gt;</b>
              The library supports a variety of methods to access the
              PCI hardware.  By default, it uses the first access method
              available, but you can use this option to override this
              decision. See <b>-A help </b>for a list of available methods and
              their descriptions.

       <b>-O &lt;param&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              The behavior of the library is controlled by several named
              parameters.  This option allows one to set the value of
              any of the parameters. Use <b>-O help </b>for a list of known
              parameters and their default values.

       <b>-H1    </b>Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration
              mechanism 1.  (This is a shorthand for <b>-A intel-conf1</b>.)

       <b>-H2    </b>Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration
              mechanism 2.  (This is a shorthand for <b>-A intel-conf2</b>.)

       <b>-F &lt;file&gt;</b>
              Instead of accessing real hardware, read the list of
              devices and values of their configuration registers from
              the given file produced by an earlier run of lspci -x.
              This is very useful for analysis of user-supplied bug
              reports, because you can display the hardware
              configuration in any way you want without disturbing the
              user with requests for more dumps.

       <b>-G     </b>Increase debug level of the library.
</pre> <h2>
MACHINE READABLE OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       If you intend to process the output of lspci automatically,
       please use one of the machine-readable output formats (<b>-m</b>, <b>-vm</b>,
       <b>-vmm</b>) described in this section. All other formats are likely to
       change between versions of lspci.

       All numbers are always printed in hexadecimal. If you want to
       process numeric ID's instead of names, please add the <b>-n </b>switch.

   <b>Simple format (-m)</b>
       In the simple format, each device is described on a single line,
       which is formatted as parameters suitable for passing to a shell
       script, i.e., values separated by whitespaces, quoted and escaped
       if necessary.  Some of the arguments are positional: slot, class,
       vendor name, device name, subsystem vendor name and subsystem
       name (the last two are empty if the device has no subsystem); the
       remaining arguments are option-like:

       <b>-r</b><i>rev</i>  Revision number.

       <b>-p</b><i>progif</i>
              Programming interface.

       The relative order of positional arguments and options is
       undefined.  New options can be added in future versions, but they
       will always have a single argument not separated from the option
       by any spaces, so they can be easily ignored if not recognized.

   <b>Verbose format (-vmm)</b>
       The verbose output is a sequence of records separated by blank
       lines.  Each record describes a single device by a sequence of
       lines, each line containing a single `<i>tag</i>: <i>value</i>' pair. The <i>tag</i>
       and the <i>value</i> are separated by a single tab character.  Neither
       the records nor the lines within a record are in any particular
       order.  Tags are case-sensitive.

       The following tags are defined:

       <b>Slot   </b>The name of the slot where the device resides
              ([<i>domain</i>:]<i>bus</i>:<i>device</i>.<i>function</i>).  This tag is always the
              first in a record.

       <b>Class  </b>Name of the class.

       <b>Vendor </b>Name of the vendor.

       <b>Device </b>Name of the device.

       <b>SVendor</b>
              Name of the subsystem vendor (optional).

       <b>SDevice</b>
              Name of the subsystem (optional).

       <b>PhySlot</b>
              The physical slot where the device resides (optional,
              Linux only).

       <b>Rev    </b>Revision number (optional).

       <b>ProgIf </b>Programming interface (optional).

       <b>Driver </b>Kernel driver currently handling the device (optional,
              Linux only).

       <b>Module </b>Kernel module reporting that it is capable of handling the
              device (optional, Linux only). Multiple lines with this
              tag can occur.

       <b>NUMANode</b>
              NUMA node this device is connected to (optional, Linux
              only).

       <b>IOMMUGroup</b>
              IOMMU group that this device is part of (optional, Linux
              only).

       New tags can be added in future versions, so you should silently
       ignore any tags you don't recognize.

   <b>Backward-compatible verbose format (-vm)</b>
       In this mode, lspci tries to be perfectly compatible with its old
       versions.  It's almost the same as the regular verbose format,
       but the <b>Device </b>tag is used for both the slot and the device name,
       so it occurs twice in a single record. Please avoid using this
       format in any new code.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/usr/local/share/pci.ids</b>
              A list of all known PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes
              and subclasses). Maintained at <a href="https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/">https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/</a>,
              use the <b>update-pciids </b>utility to download the most recent
              version.

       <b>/usr/local/share/pci.ids.gz</b>
              If lspci is compiled with support for compression, this
              file is tried before pci.ids.

       <b>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pci-ids</b>
              All ID's found in the DNS query mode are cached in this
              file.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Sometimes, lspci is not able to decode the configuration
       registers completely.  This usually happens when not enough
       documentation was available to the authors.  In such cases, it at
       least prints the <b>&lt;?&gt; </b>mark to signal that there is potentially
       something more to say. If you know the details, patches will be
       of course welcome.

       Access to the extended configuration space is currently supported
       only by the <b>linux_sysfs </b>back-end.
