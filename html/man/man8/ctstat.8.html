NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lnstat - unified linux network statistics
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lnstat </b>[<i>options</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>lnstat </b>command.

       <b>lnstat </b>is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for
       the old rtstat program. It is commonly used to periodically print
       a selection of statistical values exported by the kernel.  In
       addition to routing cache statistics, it supports any kind of
       statistics the linux kernel exports via a file in
       /proc/net/stat/.

       Each file in /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the
       column names.  These names are used by <b>lnstat </b>as keys for
       selecting which statistics to print. For every CPU present in the
       system, a line follows which lists the actual values for each
       column of the file. <b>lnstat </b>sums these values up (which in fact
       are counters) before printing them. After each interval, only the
       difference to the last value is printed.

       Files and columns may be selected by using the <b>-f </b>and <b>-k</b>
       parameters. By default, all columns of all files are printed.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       lnstat supports the following options.

       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Show summary of options.

       <b>-V, --version</b>
              Show version of program.

       <b>-c, --count &lt;count&gt;</b>
              Print &lt;count&gt; number of intervals.

       <b>-d, --dump</b>
              Dump list of available files/keys.

       <b>-f, --file &lt;file&gt;</b>
              Statistics file to use, may be specified multiple times.
              By default all files in /proc/net/stat are scanned.

       <b>-i, --interval &lt;intv&gt;</b>
              Set interval to 'intv' seconds.

       <b>-j, --json</b>
              Display results in JSON format

       <b>-k, --keys k,k,k,...</b>
              Display only keys specified. Each key <b>k </b>is of the form
              <b>[file:]key</b>. If <b>&lt;file&gt; </b>is given, the search for the given
              key is limited to that file. Otherwise the first file
              containing the searched key is being used.

       <b>-s, --subject [0-2]</b>
              Specify display of subject/header. '0' means no header at
              all, '1' prints a header only at start of the program and
              '2' prints a header every 20 lines.

       <b>-w, --width n,n,n,...</b>
              Width for each field.
