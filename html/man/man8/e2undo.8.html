NAME </h2>
<pre>
       e2undo - Replay an undo log for an ext2/ext3/ext4 file system
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>e2undo </b>[ <b>-f </b>] [ <b>-h </b>] [ <b>-n </b>] [ <b>-o </b><i>offset</i> ] [ <b>-v </b>] [ <b>-z </b><i>undo_file</i> ]
       <i>undo_log device</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>e2undo </b>will replay the undo log <i>undo_log</i> for an ext2/ext3/ext4
       file system found on <i>device</i>.  This can be used to undo a failed
       operation by an e2fsprogs program.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-f     </b>Normally, <b>e2undo </b>will check the file system superblock to
              make sure the undo log matches with the file system on the
              device.  If they do not match, <b>e2undo </b>will refuse to apply
              the undo log as a safety mechanism.  The <b>-f </b>option
              disables this safety mechanism.

       <b>-h     </b>Display a usage message.

       <b>-n     </b>Dry-run; do not actually write blocks back to the file
              system.

       <b>-o </b><i>offset</i>
              Specify the file system's <i>offset</i> (in bytes) from the
              beginning of the device or file.

       <b>-v     </b>Report which block we're currently replaying.

       <b>-z </b><i>undo_file</i>
              Before overwriting a file system block, write the old
              contents of the block to an undo file.  This undo file can
              be used with e2undo(8) to restore the old contents of the
              file system should something go wrong.  If the empty
              string is passed as the undo_file argument, the undo file
              will be written to a file named e2undo-<i>device</i>.e2undo in
              the directory specified via the <i>E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR</i>
              environment variable.

              WARNING: The undo file cannot be used to recover from a
              power or system crash.
