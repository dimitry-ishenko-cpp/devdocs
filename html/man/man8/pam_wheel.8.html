</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_wheel - Only permit root access to members of group wheel
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_wheel.so </b>[debug] [deny] [group=<i>name</i>] [root_only] [trust]
                    [use_uid]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_wheel PAM module is used to enforce the so-called <i>wheel</i>
       group. By default it permits access to the target user if the
       applicant user is a member of the <i>wheel</i> group. If no group with
       this name exist, the module is using the group with the group-ID
       <b>0</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debug</b>
           Print debug information.

       <b>deny</b>
           Reverse the sense of the auth operation: if the user is
           trying to get UID 0 access and is a member of the wheel group
           (or the group of the <b>group </b>option), deny access. Conversely,
           if the user is not in the group, return PAM_IGNORE (unless
           <b>trust </b>was also specified, in which case we return
           PAM_SUCCESS).

       <b>group=</b><i>name</i>
           Instead of checking the wheel or GID 0 groups, use the <i>name</i>
           group to perform the authentication.

       <b>root_only</b>
           The check for wheel membership is done only when the target
           user UID is 0.

       <b>trust</b>
           The pam_wheel module will return PAM_SUCCESS instead of
           PAM_IGNORE if the user is a member of the wheel group (thus
           with a little play stacking the modules the wheel members may
           be able to su to root without being prompted for a passwd).

       <b>use_uid</b>
           The check will be done against the real uid of the calling
           process, instead of trying to obtain the user from the login
           session associated with the terminal in use.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>auth </b>and <b>account </b>module types are provided.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           Authentication failure.

       PAM_BUF_ERR
           Memory buffer error.

       PAM_IGNORE
           The return value should be ignored by PAM dispatch.

       PAM_PERM_DENY
           Permission denied.

       PAM_SERVICE_ERR
           Cannot determine the user name.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           Success.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           User not known.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The root account gains access by default (rootok), only wheel
       members can become root (wheel) but Unix authenticate non-root
       applicants.

           su      auth     sufficient     pam_rootok.so
           su      auth     required       pam_wheel.so
           su      auth     required       pam_unix.so
