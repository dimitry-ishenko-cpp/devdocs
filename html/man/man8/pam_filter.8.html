NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_filter - PAM filter module
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_filter.so </b>[debug] [new_term] [non_term] run1|run2 <i>filter</i>
                     [<i>...</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This module is intended to be a platform for providing access to
       all of the input/output that passes between the user and the
       application. It is only suitable for tty-based and (stdin/stdout)
       applications.

       To function this module requires <i>filters</i> to be installed on the
       system. The single filter provided with the module simply
       transposes upper and lower case letters in the input and output
       streams. (This can be very annoying and is not kind to termcap
       based editors).

       Each component of the module has the potential to invoke the
       desired filter. The filter is always <b>execv</b>(2) with the privilege
       of the calling application and <i>not</i> that of the user. For this
       reason it cannot usually be killed by the user without closing
       their session.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debug</b>
           Print debug information.

       <b>new_term</b>
           The default action of the filter is to set the <i>PAM_TTY</i> item
           to indicate the terminal that the user is using to connect to
           the application. This argument indicates that the filter
           should set <i>PAM_TTY</i> to the filtered pseudo-terminal.

       <b>non_term</b>
           don't try to set the <i>PAM_TTY</i> item.

       <b>runX</b>
           In order that the module can invoke a filter it should know
           when to invoke it. This argument is required to tell the
           filter when to do this.

           Permitted values for <i>X</i> are <i>1</i> and <i>2</i>. These indicate the
           precise time that the filter is to be run. To understand this
           concept it will be useful to have read the <a href="../man3/pam.3.html">pam(3)</a> manual
           page. Basically, for each management group there are up to
           two ways of calling the module's functions. In the case of
           the <i>authentication</i> and <i>session</i> components there are actually
           two separate functions. For the case of authentication, these
           functions are <a href="../man3/pam_authenticate.3.html">pam_authenticate(3)</a> and <a href="../man3/pam_setcred.3.html">pam_setcred(3)</a>, here
           <b>run1 </b>means run the filter from the <b>pam_authenticate </b>function
           and <b>run2 </b>means run the filter from <b>pam_setcred</b>. In the case
           of the session modules, <i>run1</i> implies that the filter is
           invoked at the <a href="../man3/pam_open_session.3.html">pam_open_session(3)</a> stage, and <i>run2</i> for
           <a href="../man3/pam_close_session.3.html">pam_close_session(3)</a>.

           For the case of the account component. Either <i>run1</i> or <i>run2</i>
           may be used.

           For the case of the password component, <i>run1</i> is used to
           indicate that the filter is run on the first occasion of
           <a href="../man3/pam_chauthtok.3.html">pam_chauthtok(3)</a> (the <i>PAM_PRELIM_CHECK</i> phase) and <i>run2</i> is
           used to indicate that the filter is run on the second
           occasion (the <i>PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK</i> phase).

       <b>filter</b>
           The full pathname of the filter to be run and any command
           line arguments that the filter might expect.
</pre> <h2>
MODULE TYPES PROVIDED </h2>
<pre>
       All module types (<b>auth</b>, <b>account</b>, <b>password </b>and <b>session</b>) are
       provided.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_SUCCESS
           The new filter was set successfully.

       PAM_ABORT
           Critical error, immediate abort.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to see how to
       configure login to transpose upper and lower case letters once
       the user has logged in:

                   session required pam_filter.so run1 /lib/security/pam_filter/upperLOWER
