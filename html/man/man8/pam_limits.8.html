NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_limits - PAM module to limit resources
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_limits.so </b>[conf=<i>/path/to/limits.conf</i>] [debug] [set_all]
                     [utmp_early] [noaudit]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_limits PAM module sets limits on the system resources
       that can be obtained in a user-session. Users of <i>uid=0</i> are
       affected by this limits, too.

       By default limits are taken from the /etc/security/limits.conf
       config file. Then individual *.conf files from the
       /etc/security/limits.d/ directory are read. The files are parsed
       one after another in the order of "C" locale. The effect of the
       individual files is the same as if all the files were
       concatenated together in the order of parsing. If a config file
       is explicitly specified with a module option then the files in
       the above directory are not parsed.

       The module must not be called by a multithreaded application.

       If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will
       report when it denies access based on limit of maximum number of
       concurrent login sessions.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>conf=</b><i>/path/to/limits.conf</i>
           Indicate an alternative limits.conf style configuration file
           to override the default.

       <b>debug</b>
           Print debug information.

       <b>set_all</b>
           Set the limits for which no value is specified in the
           configuration file to the one from the process with the PID
           1. Please note that if the init process is systemd these
           limits will not be the kernel default limits and this option
           should not be used.

       <b>utmp_early</b>
           Some broken applications actually allocate a utmp entry for
           the user before the user is admitted to the system. If some
           of the services you are configuring PAM for do this, you can
           selectively use this module argument to compensate for this
           behavior and at the same time maintain system-wide
           consistency with a single limits.conf file.

       <b>noaudit</b>
           Do not report exceeded maximum logins count to the audit
           subsystem.
</pre> <h2>

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/security/limits.conf
           Default configuration file
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       For the services you need resources limits (login for example)
       put a the following line in /etc/pam.d/login as the last line for
       that service (usually after the pam_unix session line):

           #%PAM-1.0
           #
           # Resource limits imposed on login sessions via pam_limits
           #
           session  required  pam_limits.so

       Replace "login" for each service you are using this module.
