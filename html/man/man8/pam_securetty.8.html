NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_securetty - Limit root login to special devices
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_securetty.so </b>[debug]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       pam_securetty is a PAM module that allows root logins only if the
       user is logging in on a "secure" tty, as defined by the listing
       in the securetty file. pam_securetty checks at first, if
       /etc/securetty exists. If not and it was built with vendordir
       support, it will use /securetty. pam_securetty also checks that
       the securetty files are plain files and not world writable. It
       will also allow root logins on the tty specified with <b>console=</b>
       switch on the kernel command line and on ttys from the
       /sys/class/tty/console/active.

       This module has no effect on non-root users and requires that the
       application fills in the <b>PAM_TTY </b>item correctly.

       For canonical usage, should be listed as a <b>required</b>
       authentication method before any <b>sufficient </b>authentication
       methods.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debug</b>
           Print debug information.

       <b>noconsole</b>
           Do not automatically allow root logins on the kernel console
           device, as specified on the kernel command line or by the sys
           file, if it is not also specified in the securetty file.
</pre> <h2>
MODULE TYPES PROVIDED </h2>
<pre>
       Only the <b>auth </b>module type is provided.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_SUCCESS
           The user is allowed to continue authentication. Either the
           user is not root, or the root user is trying to log in on an
           acceptable device.

       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           Authentication is rejected. Either root is attempting to log
           in via an unacceptable device, or the securetty file is world
           writable or not a normal file.

       PAM_BUF_ERR
           Memory buffer error.

       PAM_CONV_ERR
           The conversation method supplied by the application failed to
           obtain the username.

       PAM_INCOMPLETE
           The conversation method supplied by the application returned
           PAM_CONV_AGAIN.

       PAM_SERVICE_ERR
           An error occurred while the module was determining the user's
           name or tty, or the module could not open the securetty file.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           The module could not find the user name in the /etc/passwd
           file to verify whether the user had a UID of 0. Therefore,
           the results of running this module are ignored.
