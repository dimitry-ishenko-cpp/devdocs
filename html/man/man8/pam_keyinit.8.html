NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_keyinit - Kernel session keyring initialiser module
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_keyinit.so </b>[debug] [force] [revoke]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_keyinit PAM module ensures that the invoking process has
       a session keyring other than the user default session keyring.

       The module checks to see if the process's session keyring is the
       <a href="../man7/user-session-keyring.7.html">user-session-keyring(7)</a>, and, if it is, creates a new
       <a href="../man7/session-keyring.7.html">session-keyring(7)</a> with which to replace it. If a new session
       keyring is created, it will install a link to the <a href="../man7/user-keyring.7.html">user-keyring(7)</a>
       in the session keyring so that keys common to the user will be
       automatically accessible through it. The session keyring of the
       invoking process will thenceforth be inherited by all its
       children unless they override it.

       In order to allow other PAM modules to attach tokens to the
       keyring, this module provides both an <i>auth</i> (limited to
       <a href="../man3/pam_setcred.3.html">pam_setcred(3)</a> and a <i>session</i> component. The session keyring is
       created in the module called. Moreover this module should be
       included as early as possible in a PAM configuration.

       This module is intended primarily for use by login processes. Be
       aware that after the session keyring has been replaced, the old
       session keyring and the keys it contains will no longer be
       accessible.

       This module should not, generally, be invoked by programs like
       <b>su</b>, since it is usually desirable for the key set to percolate
       through to the alternate context. The keys have their own
       permissions system to manage this.

       The keyutils package is used to manipulate keys more directly.
       This can be obtained from:

       <b>Keyutils</b>[1]
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debug</b>
           Log debug information with <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.

       <b>force</b>
           Causes the session keyring of the invoking process to be
           replaced unconditionally.

       <b>revoke</b>
           Causes the session keyring of the invoking process to be
           revoked when the invoking process exits if the session
           keyring was created for this process in the first place.
</pre> <h2>
MODULE TYPES PROVIDED </h2>
<pre>
       Only the <b>session </b>module type is provided.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_SUCCESS
           This module will usually return this value

       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           Authentication failure.

       PAM_BUF_ERR
           Memory buffer error.

       PAM_IGNORE
           The return value should be ignored by PAM dispatch.

       PAM_SERVICE_ERR
           Cannot determine the user name.

       PAM_SESSION_ERR
           This module will return this value if its arguments are
           invalid or if a system error such as ENOMEM occurs.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           User not known.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Add this line to your login entries to start each login session
       with its own session keyring:

           session  required  pam_keyinit.so

       This will prevent keys from one session leaking into another
       session for the same user.
