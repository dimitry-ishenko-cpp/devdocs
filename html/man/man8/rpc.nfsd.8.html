NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rpc.nfsd - NFS server process
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd [</b><i>options</i><b>] nproc</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>rpc.nfsd </b>program implements the user level part of the NFS
       service. The main functionality is handled by the <b>nfsd </b>kernel
       module. The user space program merely specifies what sort of
       sockets the kernel service should listen on, what NFS versions it
       should support, and how many kernel threads it should use.

       The <b>rpc.mountd </b>server provides an ancillary service needed to
       satisfy mount requests by NFS clients.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d  or  --debug</b>
              enable logging of debugging messages

       <b>-H  or  --host hostname</b>
              specify a particular hostname (or address) that NFS
              requests will be accepted on. By default, <b>rpc.nfsd </b>will
              accept NFS requests on all known network addresses.  Note
              that <b>lockd </b>(which performs file locking services for NFS)
              may still accept request on all known network addresses.
              This may change in future releases of the Linux Kernel.
              This option can be used multiple times to listen to more
              than one interface.

       <b>-S  or  --scope scope</b>
              NFSv4.1 and later require the server to report a "scope"
              which is used by the clients to detect if two connections
              are to the same server.  By default Linux NFSD uses the
              host name as the scope.

              It is particularly important for high-availablity
              configurations to ensure that all potential server nodes
              report the same server scope.

       <b>-p  or  --port port</b>
              specify a different port to listen on for NFS requests. By
              default, <b>rpc.nfsd </b>will listen on port 2049.

       <b>-r  or  --rdma</b>
              specify that NFS requests on the standard RDMA port
              ("nfsrdma", port 20049) should be honored.

       <b>--rdma=</b><i>port</i>
              Listen for RDMA requests on an alternate port - may be a
              number or a name listed in <b>/etc/services</b>.

       <b>-N  or  --no-nfs-version vers</b>
              This option can be used to request that <b>rpc.nfsd </b>does not
              offer certain versions of NFS. The current version of
              <b>rpc.nfsd </b>can support major NFS versions 3,4 and the minor
              versions 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2.

       <b>-s  or  --syslog</b>
              By default, <b>rpc.nfsd </b>logs error messages (and debug
              messages, if enabled) to stderr. This option makes
              <b>rpc.nfsd </b>log these messages to syslog instead. Note that
              errors encountered during option processing will still be
              logged to stderr regardless of this option.

       <b>-t  or  --tcp</b>
              Instruct the kernel nfs server to open and listen on a TCP
              socket. This is the default.

       <b>-T  or  --no-tcp</b>
              Instruct the kernel nfs server not to open and listen on a
              TCP socket.

       <b>-u  or  --udp</b>
              Instruct the kernel nfs server to open and listen on a UDP
              socket.

       <b>-U  or  --no-udp</b>
              Instruct the kernel nfs server not to open and listen on a
              UDP socket. This is the default.

       <b>-V  or  --nfs-version vers</b>
              This option can be used to request that <b>rpc.nfsd </b>offer
              certain versions of NFS. The current version of <b>rpc.nfsd</b>
              can support major NFS versions 3,4 and the minor versions
              4.0, 4.1 and 4.2.

       <b>-L  or  --lease-time seconds</b>
              Set the lease-time used for NFSv4.  This corresponds to
              how often clients need to confirm their state with the
              server. Valid range is from 10 to 3600 seconds.

       <b>-G  or  --grace-time seconds</b>
              Set the grace-time used for NFSv4 and NLM (for NFSv2 and
              NFSv3).  New file open requests (NFSv4) and new file locks
              (NLM) will not be allowed until after this time has passed
              to allow clients to recover state.

       <i>nproc</i>  specify the number of NFS server threads. By default,
              eight threads are started. However, for optimum
              performance several threads should be used. The actual
              figure depends on the number of and the work load created
              by the NFS clients, but a useful starting point is eight
              threads. Effects of modifying that number can be checked
              using the <a href="nfsstat.8.html">nfsstat(8)</a> program.

       Note that if the NFS server is already running, then the options
       for specifying host, port, and protocol will be ignored.  The
       number of processes given will be the only option considered, and
       the number of active <b>nfsd </b>processes will be increased or
       decreased to match this number.  In particular <b>rpc.nfsd 0 </b>will
       stop all threads and thus close any open connections.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE </h2>
<pre>
       Many of the options that can be set on the command line can also
       be controlled through values set in the <b>[nfsd] </b>section of the
       <i>/etc/nfs.conf</i> configuration file.  Values recognized include:

       <b>threads</b>
              The number of threads to start.

       <b>host   </b>A host name, or comma separated list of host names, that
              <i>rpc.nfsd</i> will listen on.  Use of the <b>--host </b>option
              replaces all host names listed here.

       <b>scope  </b>Set the server scope.

       <b>grace-time</b>
              The grace time, for both NFSv4 and NLM, in seconds.

       <b>lease-time</b>
              The lease time for NFSv4, in seconds.

       <b>port   </b>Set the port for TCP/UDP to bind to.

       <b>rdma   </b>Enable RDMA port (with "on" or "yes" etc) on the standard
              port ("nfsrdma", port 20049).

       <b>rdma-port</b>
              Set an alternate RDMA port.

       <b>UDP    </b>Enable (with "on" or "yes" etc) or disable ("off", "no")
              UDP support.

       <b>TCP    </b>Enable or disable TCP support.

       <b>vers3</b>

       <b>vers4  </b>Enable or disable <b>all </b>NFSv4 versions.  All versions are
              normally enabled by default.

       <b>vers4.1</b>

       <b>vers4.2</b>
              Setting these to "off" or similar will disable the
              selected minor versions.  Setting to "on" will enable
              them.  The default values are determined by the kernel,
              and usually minor versions default to being enabled once
              the implementation is sufficiently complete.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       If the program is built with TI-RPC support, it will enable any
       protocol and address family combinations that are marked visible
       in the <b>netconfig </b>database.
