CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       List of the requirements for links and system settings to run the
       margining test.

       <b>BIOS settings </b>(depends on the system, relevant for server
       baseboards with Xeon CPUs):

       •  Turn off PCIe Leaky Bucket Feature, Re-Equalization and Link
          Degradation;

       •  Set Error Thresholds to 0;

       •  Intel VMD for NVMe SSDs - in case of strange behavior of the
          <b>pcilmr, </b>try to run it with the VMD turned off.

       <b>Device (link) requirements:</b>

              <i>Configured by the user before running the utility, the</i>
              <i>utility does not change them:</i>

              •  The current Link data rate must be 16.0 GT/s or higher
                 (right now utility supports 16 GT/s and 32 GT/s Links);

              •  Link Downstream Component must be at D0 Power
                 Management State.

              <i>Configured by the utility during operation, utility set</i>
              <i>them to their original state after receiving the results:</i>

              •  The ASPM must be disabled in both the Downstream Port
                 and Upstream Port;

              •  The Hardware Autonomous Speed Disable bit of the Link
                 Control 2 register must be Set in both the Downstream
                 Port and Upstream Port;

              •  The Hardware Autonomous Width Disable bit of the Link
                 Control register must be Set in both the Downstream
                 Port and Upstream Port.

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcilmr </b>utility allows you to take advantage of the PCIe Lane
       Margining at the Receiver capability which is mandatory for all
       Ports supporting a data rate of 16.0 GT/s or higher, including
       Pseudo Ports (Retimers). Lane Margining at Receiver enables
       system software to obtain the margin information of a given
       Receiver while the Link is in the L0 state. The margin
       information includes both voltage and time, in either direction
       from the current Receiver position. Margining support for timing
       is required, while support for voltage is optional at 16.0 GT/s
       and required at 32.0 GT/s and higher data rates. Also,
       independent time margining and independent voltage margining is
       optional.

       Utility allows to get an approximation of the eye margin diagram
       in the form of a rhombus (by four points). Lane Margining at the
       Receiver capability enables users to margin PCIe links without a
       hardware debugger and without the need to stop the target system.
       Utility can be useful to debug link issues due to receiver
       margins.

       <b>pcilmr </b>requires root privileges (to access Extended Configuration
       Space), but during our testing there were no problems with the
       devices and they successfully returned to their normal initial
       state after the end of testing.
</pre> <h2>
RESULTS GRADING </h2>
<pre>
       The PCIe specification provides reference values for the eye
       diagram, which are also used by the <b>pcilmr </b>to evaluate the
       results, but it seems that it makes sense to contact the
       manufacturer of a particular device for references.

       The utility uses values set in PCIe Base Spec Rev. 5.0 Section
       8.4.2 as the default eye width and height minimum references.
       Recommended values were taken from the PCIe Architecture PHY Test
       Spec Rev 5.0 (Transmitter Electrical Compliance).

       Reference grading values currently used by the utility are
       presented in the table below:

       ┌─────┬─────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐
       │     │  <b>16 GT/s </b>│<b>(Gen 4)    </b>│   <b>32 GT/s </b>│<b>(Gen 5)    </b>│
       │     │    <b>EW    </b>│   <b>EH     </b>│   <b>EW      </b>│   <b>EH     </b>│
       ├─────┼──────────┼──────────┼───────────┼──────────┤
       │ <b>Min </b>│ 18.75 ps │  15 mV   │ 9.375 ps  │  15 mV   │
       │     │ 30% UI   │          │ 30% UI    │          │
       ├─────┼──────────┼──────────┼───────────┼──────────┤
       │ <b>Rec </b>│ 23.75 ps │  21 mV   │10.157 ps  │19.75 mV  │
       │     │ 38% UI   │          │33% UI     │          │
       └─────┴──────────┴──────────┴───────────┴──────────┘

       <b>pcilmr </b>uses full eye width and height values to grade lanes.
       However, it is possible that device supports only one side
       margining. In such cases by default utility will calculate EW or
       EH as a double one side result.

       If info for specific device is available, you can configure
       grading criteria and tweak utility behavior in one-side only
       cases for your device using <i>-g</i> link specific option (see below).
</pre> <h2>
HARDWARE QUIRKS SUPPORT </h2>
<pre>
       Thanks to testing or directly from the manufacturer's
       documentation, we know that some devices require special
       treatment during the margining.  Utility detects such devices
       based on their Vendor ID - Device ID pair.  Right now the list of
       special devices is hardcoded in <i>margin_hw</i> file. For such devices
       utility can automatically adjust port margining parameters or
       grading options.

       For example, for Ice Lake CPUs RC ports <b>pcilmr </b>will change device
       MaxVoltageOffset value and will force the use of '<i>one side is the</i>
       <i>whole</i>' grading mode.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Device Specifier</b>
       <b>You can specify Downstream or Upstream Port of the Link.</b>

       <b>&lt;device/component&gt;</b>
              [<i>&lt;domain&gt;</i>:]<i>&lt;bus&gt;</i>:<i>&lt;dev&gt;</i>.<i>&lt;func&gt;</i> (see <a href="lspci.8.html">lspci(8)</a>)

   <b>Utility Modes</b>
       <b>--margin </b><i>&lt;downstream component&gt; ...</i>
              Margin selected Links.

       <b>--full </b>Margin all ready for testing (in a meaning similar to the
              <b>--scan </b>option) Links in the system (one by one).

       <b>--scan </b>Scan for Links with negotiated speed 16 GT/s or higher.
              Mark "Ready" those of them in which at least one of the
              Link sides have Margining Ready bit set meaning that these
              Links are ready for testing and you can run utility on
              them.

   <b>Margining Common (for all specified links) options</b>
       <b>-c </b>Print Device Lane Margining Capabilities only. Do not run
       margining.

       <b>-e </b><i>&lt;errors&gt;</i>
              Specify Error Count Limit for margining.
              Default: 4.

       <b>-o </b><i>&lt;directory&gt;</i>
              Save margining results in csv form into the specified
              directory. Utility will generate file with the name in
              form of "lmr_<i>&lt;port&gt;</i>_Rx<i>#</i>_<i>&lt;timestamp&gt;</i>.csv" for each
              successfully tested receiver.

       <b>-d </b><i>&lt;time&gt;</i>
              Specify dwell time in seconds for the margining step.
              Default: 1 s

   <b>Margining Link specific options</b>
       <b>-l </b><i>&lt;lane&gt;</i><b>[</b><i>,&lt;lane&gt;...</i><b>]</b>
              ®.br Remember that Device may use Lane Reversal for Lane
              numbering. However, utility uses logical lane numbers in
              arguments and for logging. Utility will automatically
              determine Lane Reversal and tune its calls.
              Default: all link lanes.

       <b>-r </b><i>&lt;recvn&gt;</i><b>[</b><i>,&lt;recvn&gt;...</i><b>]</b>
              Specify Receivers to select margining targets.
              Default: all available Receivers (including Retimers).

       <b>-p </b><i>&lt;parallel_lanes&gt;</i>
              Specify number of lanes to margin simultaneously.
              According to spec it's possible for Receiver to margin up
              to MaxLanes + 1 lanes simultaneously, but during testing,
              performing margining on several lanes simultaneously led
              to results that were different from sequential margining,
              so this feature requires additional verification and <i>-p</i>
              option right now is for experiments mostly.
              Default: 1.

       <b>Use only one of -T/-t options at the same time (same for -V/-v).</b>
       <b>Without these options utility will use MaxSteps from Device</b>
       <b>capabilities as test limit.</b>

       <b>-T     </b>Time Margining will continue until the Error Count is no
              more than an Error Count Limit. Use this option to find
              Link limit.

       <b>-t </b><i>&lt;steps&gt;</i>
              Specify maximum number of steps for Time Margining.

       <b>-V     </b>Same as <i>-T</i> option, but for Voltage.

       <b>-v </b><i>&lt;steps&gt;</i>
              Specify maximum number of steps for Voltage Margining.

       <b>-g </b><i>&lt;recvn&gt;</i><b>t=</b><i>&lt;criteria&gt;</i><b>{%|ps}[,f]</b>

          <i>&lt;recvn&gt;</i><b>t=f[,</b><i>&lt;criteria&gt;</i><b>{%|ps}]</b>

          <i>&lt;recvn&gt;</i><b>v=</b><i>&lt;criteria&gt;</i><b>[,f]</b>

          <i>&lt;recvn&gt;</i><b>v=f[,</b><i>&lt;criteria&gt;</i><b>]</b>
              Specify pass/fail grading criteria for eye width (timing -
              t) or height (voltage - v) for one of the link receivers.
              For EW you must choose one of the units (% UI or ps), for
              EH mV is used.
              Additional flag <i>f</i> is for situations when port doesn't
              support two side independent margining. In such cases by
              default utility will calculate EW or EH as a double one
              side result. You can add <i>f</i> flag for <i>-g</i> option to tell the
              utility that the result in one direction is actually the
              measurement of the full eye and it does not need to be
              multiplied. This is so called '<i>one side is the whole</i>'
              grading mode.
