       systemd-boot-random-seed.service - Refresh boot loader random
       seed at boot

SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-boot-random-seed.service
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-boot-random-seed.service is a system service that
       automatically refreshes the boot loader random seed stored in the
       EFI System Partition (ESP), from the Linux kernel entropy pool.
       The boot loader random seed is primarily consumed and updated by
       <a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a> from the UEFI environment (or <a href="../man7/systemd-stub.7.html">systemd-stub(7)</a> if
       the former is not used, but the latter is), and passed as initial
       RNG seed to the OS. It is an effective way to ensure the OS comes
       up with a random pool that is fully initialized.

       The service also automatically generates a 'system token' to
       store in an EFI variable in the system's NVRAM. The boot loader
       may then combine the on-disk random seed and the system token by
       cryptographic hashing, and pass it to the OS it boots as
       initialization seed for its entropy pool. Note: the random seed
       stored in the ESP is refreshed on <i>every</i> reboot ensuring that
       multiple subsequent boots will boot with different seeds. On the
       other hand, the system token is generated randomly <i>once</i>, and then
       persistently stored in the system's EFI variable storage,
       ensuring the same disk image won't result in the same series of
       boot loader seed values if used on multiple systems in parallel.

       The systemd-boot-random-seed.service unit invokes the <b>bootctl</b>
       <b>random-seed </b>command, which updates the random seed in the ESP,
       and initializes the system token if it's not initialized yet. The
       service is conditionalized so that it is run only when a boot
       loader is used that implements the <b>Boot Loader Interface</b>[1].

       For further details see <a href="../man1/bootctl.1.html">bootctl(1)</a>, regarding the command this
       service invokes.

       Note the relationship between systemd-boot-random-seed.service
       and <a href="systemd-random-seed.8.html">systemd-random-seed(8)</a>. The former maintains the random seed
       consumed and updated by the boot environment (i.e. by
       <a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a> or <a href="../man7/systemd-stub.7.html">systemd-stub(7)</a>), the latter maintains a
       random seed consumed and updated by the OS itself. The former
       ensures that the OS has a filled entropy pool already during
       earliest boot when regular disk access is not available yet (i.e.
       when the OS random seed cannot be loaded yet). The latter is
       processed much later, once writable disk access is available.
       Thus it cannot be used to seed the initial boot phase, but
       typically has much higher quality of entropy. Both files are
       consumed and updated at boot, but at different times.
       Specifically:

        1. In UEFI mode, the <a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a> or <a href="../man7/systemd-stub.7.html">systemd-stub(7)</a>
           components load the boot loader random seed from the ESP,
           hash it with available entropy and the system token, and then
           update it on disk. A derived seed is passed to the kernel
           which writes it to its entropy pool.

        2. In userspace the systemd-random-seed.service service loads
           the OS random seed, writes it to the kernel entropy pool, and
           then updates it on disk with a new value derived from the
           kernel entropy pool.

        3. In userspace the systemd-boot-random-seed.service service
           updates the boot loader random seed with a new value derived
           from the kernel entropy pool.

       This logic should ensure that the kernel's entropy pool is seeded
       during earliest bool already, if possible, but the highest
       quality entropy is propagated back to both on-disk seeds.
