SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>iptraf-ng </b>{ [ <b>-f </b>] [ { <b>-i </b><i>iface</i> | <b>-g </b>| <b>-d </b><i>iface</i> | <b>-s </b><i>iface</i> | <b>-z</b>
       <i>iface</i> | <b>-l </b><i>iface</i> } [ <b>-t </b><i>timeout</i> ] [ <b>-B </b>[ <b>-L </b><i>logfile</i> ] ] ] | [ <b>-h</b>
       ] }
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>iptraf-ng </b>is an ncurses-based IP LAN monitor that generates
       various network statistics including TCP info, UDP counts, ICMP
       and OSPF information, Ethernet load info, node stats, IP checksum
       errors, and others.

       If the <b>iptraf-ng </b>command is issued without any command-line
       options, the program comes up in interactive mode, with the
       various facilities accessed through the main menu.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       These options can also be supplied to the command:

       <b>-i </b><i>iface</i>
              immediately start the IP traffic monitor on the specified
              interface, or all interfaces if "-i all" is specified

       <b>-g     </b>immediately start the general interface statistics

       <b>-d </b><i>iface</i>
              allows you to immediately start the detailed on the
              indicated interface (iface)

       <b>-s </b><i>iface</i>
              allows you to immediately monitor TCP and UDP traffic on
              the specified interface (iface)

       <b>-z </b><i>iface</i>
              shows packet counts by size on the specified interface

       <b>-l </b><i>iface</i>
              start the LAN station monitor on the specified interface,
              or all LAN interfaces if "-l all" is specified

       <b>-t </b><i>timeout</i>
              tells IPTraf-ng to run the specified facility for only
              <i>timeout</i> minutes.  This option is used only with one of the
              above parameters.

       <b>-B     </b>redirect standard output to /dev/null, closes standard
              input, and forks the program into the background.  Can be
              used only with one of the facility invocation parameters
              above.  Send the backgrounded process a USR2 signal to
              terminate.

       <b>-L logfile</b>
              allows you to specify an alternate log file name.  The
              default log file name is based on either the interface
              selected (detailed interface statistics, TCP/UDP service
              statistics, packet size breakdown), or the instance of the
              facility (IP traffic monitor, LAN station monitor).  If a
              path is not specified, the log file is placed in
              <b>/var/log/iptraf-ng</b>

       <b>-f     </b>clears all locks and counters, causing this instance of
              IPTraf-ng to think it's the first one running.  This
              should only be used to recover from an abnormal
              termination or system crash.

       <b>-h     </b>shows a command summary
</pre> <h2>
SIGNALS </h2>
<pre>
        SIGUSR1 - rotates log files while program is running
        SIGUSR2 - terminates an IPTraf-ng process running in the
       background.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
        /var/log/iptraf-ng/*.log - log file
        /var/lib/iptraf-ng/* - important IPTraf-ng data files
