NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lvm_import_vdo — utility to import VDO volumes into a new volume
       group.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lvm_import_vdo</b>
              [<i>options</i>] <i>device</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       lvm_import_vdo utility imports VDO volumes created and managed by
       <b>vdo</b>(8) manager into <b>lvm2</b>(8) managed VDO LV. This is realized by
       moving VDO superblock by 2MiB and creating lvm2 metadata at the
       front of this device. The operation is not reversible, thus after
       conversion to lvm2 the access to VDO data is only possible with
       <b>lvm2</b>(8) commands, <b>vdo</b>(8) manager no longer control such volume.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-f</b>|<b>--force</b>
              Bypass some sanity checks.

       <b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b>
              Display the help text.

       <b>-n</b>|<b>--name</b>
              Specifies the name of converted VDO LV. When the name is
              not specified, some automatic name is selected. In case
              the converted VDO volume is already using LV a backend
              device, the name of this LV is used for VDO LV.  In this
              case also the of volume group must stay same.  Automatic
              name may change between releases and currently selects
              "vdolv" as LV name and VG name is selected from sequence
              "vdovg", "vdovg1", ...

       <b>-v</b>|<b>--verbose</b>
              Be more verbose.

       <b>-y</b>|<b>--yes</b>
              Answer "yes" at any prompts.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
              Print verbosely commands without running them.

       <b>--no-snapshot</b>
              With this option conversion tool will not use snapshot
              (COW storage) for conversion in your $TMPDIR filesystem
              and it will directly manipulate with VDO device in-place.
              Warning: the snapshot usage makes the whole conversion
              transactional and the snapshot can be just simply merged
              once the whole conversion has successfully proceeded. In
              the case of error the snapshot is just removed.  Without
              the use of snapshot there is higher risk of problems with
              recoverability in case some unexpected error occurs.

       <b>--vdo-config</b>
              Configuration file for VDO manager. Can be used to specify
              configuration for vdo manager.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       On successful completion, the status code is 0.  A status code of
       1 is used for failure.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Convert VDO volume created by vdo manager into logical volume LV1
       with within volume group VG1.

       # <b>lvm_import_vdo --name VG1/LV1 /dev/mapper/vdo-volume</b>
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>TMPDIR </b>The temporary directory name for mount points. Defaults to
              "<i>/tmp</i>".

       <b>DM_DEV_DIR</b>
              The device directory name.  Defaults to "<i>/dev</i>" and must be
              an absolute path.

       <b>DM_UUID_PREFIX</b>
              Specify uuid prefix for snapshot volume used during vdo
              conversion.

       <b>LVM_BINARY</b>
              Allow to overide command called from lvm. Defaults to
              "<i>lvm</i>".

       <b>VDO_BINARY</b>
              Allow to overide command called from vdo. Defaults to
              "<i>vdo</i>".
