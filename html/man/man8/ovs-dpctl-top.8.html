NAME </h2>

       <b>ovs-dpctl-top </b>- Top like behavior for ovs-dpctl dump-flows
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ovs-dpctl-top </b>[-h] [-v] [-f FLOWFILES] [-V] [-s] [--host HOST]
       [-a | --accumulate] [--accumulate-decay ACCUMULATEDECAY] [-d
       DELAY]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This program summarizes <b>ovs-dpctl </b>flow content by aggregating the
       number of packets, total bytes and occurrence of the following
       fields:

              - Datapath in_port

              - Ethernet type

              - Source and destination MAC addresses

              - IP protocol

              - Source and destination IPv4 addresses

              - Source and destination IPv6 addresses

              - UDP and TCP destination port

              - Tunnel source and destination addresses

   <b>Output shows four values:</b>
              - FIELDS: the flow fields for example in_port(1).

              - COUNT: the number of lines in the dump-flow output
              contain the flow field.

              - PACKETS: the total number of packets containing the flow
              field.

              - BYTES: the total number of bytes containing the flow
              field.  If units are not present then values are in bytes.

              - AVERAGE: the average packets size (BYTES/PACKET).

   <b>Top Behavior</b>
       While in top mode, the default behavior, the following single
       character commands are supported:

              a - toggles top in accumulate and live mode.  Accumulate
              mode is described below.

              s - toggles which column is used to sort content in
              decreasing order.  A DESC title is placed over the column.

              _ - a space indicating to collect dump-flow content again

              h - halt output.  Any character will restart sampling

              f - cycle through flow fields

              q - q for quit.

   <b>Accumulate Mode</b>
       There are two supported modes: live and accumulate.  The default
       is live.  The parameter <b>--accumulate  </b>or the 'a' character in top
       mode enables the latter.  In live mode, recent dump-flow content
       is presented.  Where as accumulate mode keeps track of the prior
       historical information until the flow is reset not when the flow
       is purged.  Reset flows are determined when the packet count for
       a flow has decreased from its previous sample.  There is one
       caveat, eventually the system will run out of memory if, after
       the accumulate-decay period any flows that have not been
       refreshed are purged.  The goal here is to free memory of flows
       that are not active.  Statistics are not decremented.  Their
       purpose is to reflect the overall history of the flow fields.

   <b>Debugging Errors</b>
       Parsing errors are counted and displayed in the status line at
       the beginning of the output.  Use the <b>--verbose </b>option with
       <b>--script to see what output was not parsed, like this:</b>

       $ ovs-dpctl dump-flows | ovs-dpctl-top <b>--script --verbose</b>

       Error messages will identify content that failed to parse.

   <b>Access Remote Hosts</b>
       The <b>--host </b>must follow the format user@hostname.  This script
       simply calls 'ssh user@Hostname' without checking for login
       credentials therefore public keys should be installed on the
       system identified by hostname, such as:

       $ ssh-copy-id user@hostname

       Consult ssh-copy-id man pages for more details.

   <b>Expected usage</b>
       $ ovs-dpctl-top

       or to run as a script:

       $ ovs-dpctl dump-flows &gt; dump-flows.log

       $ ovs-dpctl-top <b>--script --flow-file </b>dump-flows.log

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show this help message and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              show program's version number and exit.

       <b>-f </b>FLOWFILES, <b>--flow-file </b>FLOWFILES
              file containing flows from ovs-dpctl dump-flow.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              enable debug level verbosity.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--script</b>
              Run from a script (no user interface).

       <b>--host </b>HOST
              Specify a user@host for retrieving flows see Accessing
              Remote Hosts for more information.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--accumulate</b>
              Accumulate dump-flow content.

       <b>--accumulate-decay </b>ACCUMULATEDECAY
              Decay old accumulated flows.  The default is 5 minutes. A
              value of 0 disables decay.

       <b>-d </b>DELAY, <b>--delay </b>DELAY
              Delay in milliseconds to collect dump-flow content (sample
              rate).
