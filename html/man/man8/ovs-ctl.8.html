</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>ovs-ctl </b>program starts, stops, and checks the status of Open
       vSwitch daemons.  It is not meant to be invoked directly by
       system administrators but to be called internally by system
       startup scripts.

       Each <b>ovs-ctl </b>command is described separately below.

   <b>The start command</b>
       The <b>start </b>command starts Open vSwitch.  It performs the following
       tasks:

       1. Loads the Open vSwitch kernel module.  If this fails, and the
          Linux bridge module is loaded but no bridges exist, it tries
          to unload the bridge module and tries loading the Open vSwitch
          kernel module again.  (This is because the Open vSwitch kernel
          module cannot coexist with the Linux bridge module before
          2.6.37.)

       The <b>start </b>command skips the following steps if <b>ovsdb-server </b>is
       already running:

       2. If the Open vSwitch database file does not exist, it creates
          it.  If the database does exist, but it has an obsolete
          version, it upgrades it to the latest schema.

       3. Starts <b>ovsdb-server</b>, unless the <b>--no-ovsdb-server </b>command
          option is given.

       4. Initializes a few values inside the database.

       5. If the <b>--delete-bridges </b>option was used, deletes all of the
          bridges from the database.

       6. If the <b>--delete-transient-ports </b>option was used, deletes all
          ports that have <b>other_config:transient </b>set to true.

       The <b>start </b>command skips the following step if <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is
       already running, or if the <b>--no-ovs-vswitchd </b>command option is
       given:

       7. Starts <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

   <b>Options</b>
       Several command-line options influence the <b>start </b>command’s
       behavior.  Some form of the following option should ordinarily be
       specified:

       • <b>--system-id=&lt;uuid&gt; </b>or <b>--system-id=random</b>

         This specifies a unique system identifier to store into
         <b>external-ids:system-id </b>in the database’s <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table.
         Remote managers that talk to the Open vSwitch database server
         over network protocols use this value to identify and
         distinguish Open vSwitch instances, so it should be unique (at
         least) within OVS instances that will connect to a single
         controller.

         When <b>random </b>is specified, <b>ovs-ctl </b>will generate a random ID
         that persists from one run to another (stored in a file).  When
         another string is specified <b>ovs-ctl </b>uses it literally.

       The following options should be specified if the defaults are not
       suitable:

       • <b>--system-type=&lt;type&gt; </b>or <b>--system-version=&lt;version&gt;</b>

         Sets the value to store in the <b>system-type </b>and <b>system-version</b>
         columns, respectively, in the database’s <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table.
         Remote managers may use these values too determine the kind of
         system to which they are connected (primarily for display to
         human administrators).

         When not specified, <b>ovs-ctl </b>uses values from the optional
         <b>system-type.conf </b>and <b>system-version.conf </b>files (see <i>Files</i>) or
         it uses the <b>lsb_release </b>program, if present, to provide
         reasonable defaults.

       The following options are also likely to be useful:

       • <b>--external-id="&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;"</b>

         Sets <b>external-ids:&lt;name&gt; </b>to &lt;value&gt; in the database’s
         <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table.  Specifying this option multiple times adds
         multiple key-value pairs.

       • <b>--delete-bridges</b>

         Ordinarily Open vSwitch bridges persist from one system boot to
         the next, as long as the database is preserved.  Some
         environments instead expect to re-create all of the bridges and
         other configuration state on every boot.  This option supports
         that, by deleting all Open vSwitch bridges after starting
         <b>ovsdb-server </b>but before starting <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

       • <b>--delete-transient-ports</b>

         Deletes all ports that have <b>other_config:transient </b>set to <b>true</b>.
         This is important on certain environments where some ports are
         going to be recreated after reboot, but other ports need to be
         persisted in the database.

       • <b>--ovs-user=user[:group]</b>

         Ordinarily Open vSwitch daemons are started as the user
         invoking the ovs-ctl command.  Some system administrators would
         prefer to have the various daemons spawn as different users in
         their environments.  This option allows passing the <b>--user</b>
         option to the <b>ovsdb-server </b>and <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>daemons, allowing
         them to change their privilege levels.

       The following options are less important:

       • <b>--no-monitor</b>

         By default <b>ovs-ctl </b>passes <b>--monitor </b>to <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>and
         <b>ovsdb-server</b>, requesting that it spawn a process monitor which
         will restart the daemon if it crashes.  This option suppresses
         that behavior.

       • <b>--daemon-cwd=&lt;directory&gt;</b>

         Specifies the current working directory that the OVS daemons
         should run from.  The default is <b>/ </b>(the root directory) if this
         option is not specified.  (This option is useful because most
         systems create core files in a process’s current working
         directory and because a file system that is in use as a
         process’s current working directory cannot be unmounted.)

       • <b>--no-force-corefiles</b>

         By default, <b>ovs-ctl </b>enables core dumps for the OVS daemons.
         This option disables that behavior.

       • <b>--no-mlockall</b>

         By default <b>ovs-ctl </b>passes <b>--mlockall </b>to <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>,
         requesting that it lock all of its virtual memory, preventing
         it from being paged to disk.  This option suppresses that
         behavior.

       • <b>--no-self-confinement</b>

         Disable self-confinement for <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>and <b>ovsdb-server</b>
         daemons.  This flag may be used when, for example, OpenFlow
         controller creates its Unix Domain Socket outside OVS run
         directory and OVS needs to connect to it.  It is better to
         stick with the default behavior and not to use this flag,
         unless:

         • You have Open vSwitch running under SELinux or AppArmor
           Mandatory Access Control that would prevent OVS from messing
           with sockets outside ordinary OVS directories.

         • You believe that relying on protocol handshakes (e.g.
           OpenFlow) is enough to prevent OVS to adversely interact with
           other daemons running on your system.

         • You don’t have much worries of remote OVSDB exploits in the
           first place, because, perhaps, OVSDB manager is running on
           the same host as OVS and share similar attack vectors.

       • <b>--ovsdb-server-priority=&lt;niceness&gt; </b>or
         <b>--ovs-vswitchd-priority=&lt;niceness&gt;</b>

         Sets the <a href="../man1/nice.1.html">nice(1)</a> level used for each daemon.  All of them
         default to <b>-10</b>.

       • <b>--ovsdb-server-wrapper=&lt;wrapper&gt; </b>or
         <b>--ovs-vswitchd-wrapper=&lt;wrapper&gt;</b>

         Configures the specified daemon to run under &lt;wrapper&gt;, which
         is one of the following:

         • <b>valgrind</b>: Run the daemon under <a href="../man1/valgrind.1.html">valgrind(1)</a>, if it is
           installed, logging to <b>&lt;daemon&gt;.valgrind.log.&lt;pid&gt; </b>in the log
           directory.

         • <b>strace</b>: Run the daemon under <a href="../man1/strace.1.html">strace(1)</a>, if it is installed,
           logging to <b>&lt;daemon&gt;.strace.log.&lt;pid&gt; </b>in the log directory.

         • <b>glibc</b>: Enable GNU C library features designed to find memory
           errors.

         By default, no wrapper is used.

         Each of the wrappers can expose bugs in Open vSwitch that lead
         to incorrect operation, including crashes.  The <b>valgrind </b>and
         <b>strace </b>wrappers greatly slow daemon operations so they should
         not be used in production.  They also produce voluminous logs
         that can quickly fill small disk partitions.  The <b>glibc </b>wrapper
         is less resource-intensive but still somewhat slows the
         daemons.

       The following options control file locations.  They should only
       be used if the default locations cannot be used.  See <b>FILES</b>,
       below, for more information.

       • <b>--db-file=&lt;file&gt;</b>

         Overrides the file name for the OVS database.

       • <b>--db-sock=&lt;socket&gt;</b>

         Overrides the file name for the Unix domain socket used to
         connect to <b>ovsdb-server</b>.

       • <b>--db-schema=&lt;schema&gt;</b>

         Overrides the file name for the OVS database schema.

       • <b>--extra-dbs=&lt;file&gt;</b>

         Adds &lt;file&gt; as an extra database for <b>ovsdb-server </b>to serve out.
         Multiple space-separated file names may also be specified.
         &lt;file&gt; should begin with <b>/</b>; if it does not, then it will be
         taken as relative to &lt;dbdir&gt;.

   <b>The stop command</b>
       The <b>stop </b>command stops the <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>and <b>ovsdb-server </b>daemons.
       It does not unload the Open vSwitch kernel modules. It can take
       the same <b>--no-ovsdb-server </b>and <b>--no-ovs-vswitchd </b>options as that
       of the <b>start </b>command.

       This command does nothing and finishes successfully if the OVS
       daemons aren’t running.

   <b>The restart command</b>
       The <b>restart </b>command performs a <b>stop </b>followed by a <b>start </b>command.
       The command can take the same options as that of the <b>start</b>
       command. In addition, it saves and restores OpenFlow flows for
       each individual bridge.

   <b>The status command</b>
       The <b>status </b>command checks whether the OVS daemons <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
       and <b>ovsdb-server </b>are running and prints messages with that
       information.  It exits with status 0 if the daemons are running,
       1 otherwise.

   <b>The version command</b>
       The <b>version </b>command runs <b>ovsdb-server --version </b>and <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
       <b>--version</b>.

   <b>The force-reload-kmod command</b>
       The <b>force-reload-kmod </b>command allows upgrading the Open vSwitch
       kernel module without rebooting.  It performs the following
       tasks:

       1. Gets a list of OVS “internal” interfaces, that is, network
          devices implemented by Open vSwitch.  The most common examples
          of these are bridge “local ports”.

       2. Saves the OpenFlow flows of each bridge.

       3. Stops the Open vSwitch daemons, as if by a call to <b>ovs-ctl</b>
          <b>stop</b>.

       4. Saves the kernel configuration state of the OVS internal
          interfaces listed in step 1, including IP and IPv6 addresses
          and routing table entries.

       5. Unloads the Open vSwitch kernel module (including the bridge
          compatibility module if it is loaded).

       6. Starts OVS back up, as if by a call to <b>ovs-ctl start</b>.  This
          reloads the kernel module, restarts the OVS daemons and
          finally restores the saved OpenFlow flows.

       7. Restores the kernel configuration state that was saved in step
          4.

       8. Checks for daemons that may need to be restarted because they
          have packet sockets that are listening on old instances of
          Open vSwitch kernel interfaces and, if it finds any, prints a
          warning on stdout.  DHCP is a common example: if the ISC DHCP
          client is running on an OVS internal interface, then it will
          have to be restarted after completing the above procedure.
          (It would be nice if <b>ovs-ctl </b>could restart daemons
          automatically, but the details are far too specific to a
          particular distribution and installation.)

       <b>force-kmod-reload </b>internally stops and starts OVS, so it accepts
       all of the options accepted by the <b>start </b>command except for the
       <b>--no-ovs-vswitchd </b>option.

   <b>The load-kmod command</b>
       The <b>load-kmod </b>command loads the openvswitch kernel modules if
       they are not already loaded.  This operation also occurs as part
       of the <b>start </b>command.  The motivation for providing the <b>load-kmod</b>
       command is to allow errors when loading modules to be handled
       separately from other errors that may occur when running the
       <b>start </b>command.

       By default the <b>load-kmod </b>command attempts to load the <b>openvswitch</b>
       kernel module.

   <b>The enable-protocol command</b>
       The <b>enable-protocol </b>command checks for rules related to a
       specified protocol in the system’s <a href="iptables.8.html">iptables(8)</a> configuration.  If
       there are no rules specifically related to that protocol, then it
       inserts a rule to accept the specified protocol.

       More specifically:

       • If <b>iptables </b>is not installed or not enabled, this command does
         nothing, assuming that lack of filtering means that the
         protocol is enabled.

       • If the <b>INPUT </b>chain has a rule that matches the specified
         protocol, then this command does nothing, assuming that
         whatever rule is installed reflects the system administrator’s
         decisions.

       • Otherwise, this command installs a rule that accepts traffic of
         the specified protocol.

       This command normally completes successfully, even if it does
       nothing.  Only the failure of an attempt to insert a rule
       normally causes it to return an exit code other than 0.

       The following options control the protocol to be enabled:

       • <b>--protocol=&lt;protocol&gt;</b>

         The name of the IP protocol to be enabled, such as <b>gre </b>or <b>tcp</b>.
         The default is <b>gre</b>.

       • <b>--sport=&lt;sport&gt; </b>or <b>--dport=&lt;dport&gt;</b>

         TCP or UDP source or destination port to match.  These are
         optional and allowed only with <b>--protocol=tcp </b>or
         <b>--protocol=udp</b>.

   <b>The delete-transient-ports command</b>
       Deletes all ports that have the <b>other_config:transient </b>value set
       to true.

   <b>The help command</b>
       Prints a usage message and exits successfully.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to the options listed for each command above, these
       options control the behavior of several <b>ovs-ctl </b>commands.

       By default, <b>ovs-ctl </b>controls the <b>ovsdb-server </b>and <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
       daemons.  The following options restrict that control to exclude
       one or the other:

       • <b>--no-ovsdb-server</b>

         Specifies that the <b>ovs-ctl </b>commands <b>start</b>, <b>stop</b>, and <b>restart</b>
         should not modify the running status of <b>ovsdb-server</b>.

       • <b>--no-ovs-vswitchd</b>

         Specifies that the <b>ovs-ctl </b>commands <b>start</b>, <b>stop</b>, and <b>restart</b>
         should not modify the running status of <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.  It is an
         error to include this option with the <b>force-reload-kmod</b>
         command.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ovs-ctl </b>exits with status 0 on success and nonzero on failure.
       The <b>start </b>command is considered to succeed if OVS is already
       started; the <b>stop </b>command is considered to succeed if OVS is
       already stopped.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables affect <b>ovs-ctl</b>:

       • <b>PATH</b>

         <b>ovs-ctl </b>does not hardcode the location of any of the programs
         that it runs.  <b>ovs-ctl </b>will add the &lt;sbindir&gt; and &lt;bindir&gt; that
         were specified at <b>configure </b>time to <b>PATH</b>, if they are not
         already present.

       • <b>OVS_LOGDIR</b>, <b>OVS_RUNDIR</b>, <b>OVS_DBDIR</b>, <b>OVS_SYSCONFDIR</b>,
         <b>OVS_PKGDATADIR</b>, <b>OVS_BINDIR</b>, <b>OVS_SBINDIR</b>

         Setting one of these variables in the environment overrides the
         respective <b>configure </b>option, both for <b>ovs-ctl </b>itself and for
         the other Open vSwitch programs that it runs.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ovs-ctl </b>uses the following files:

       • <b>ovs-lib</b>

         Shell function library used internally by <b>ovs-ctl</b>.  It must be
         installed in the same directory as <b>ovs-ctl</b>.

       • <b>&lt;logdir&gt;/&lt;daemon&gt;.log</b>

         Per-daemon logfiles.

       • <b>&lt;rundir&gt;/&lt;daemon&gt;.pid</b>

         Per-daemon pidfiles to track whether a daemon is running and
         with what process ID.

       • <b>&lt;pkgdatadir&gt;/vswitch.ovsschema</b>

         The OVS database schema used to initialize the database (use
         <b>--db-schema </b>to override this location).

       • <b>&lt;dbdir&gt;/conf.db</b>

         The OVS database (use <b>--db-file </b>to override this location).

       • <b>&lt;rundir&gt;/openvswitch/db.sock</b>

         The Unix domain socket used for local communication with
         <b>ovsdb-server </b>(use <b>--db-sock </b>to override this location).

       • <b>&lt;sysconfdir&gt;/openvswitch/system-id.conf</b>

         The persistent system UUID created and read by
         <b>--system-id=random</b>.

       • <b>&lt;sysconfdir&gt;/openvswitch/system-type.conf </b>and
         <b>&lt;sysconfdir&gt;/openvswitch/system-version.conf</b>

         The <b>system-type </b>and <b>system-version </b>values stored in the
         database’s <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table when not specified as a
         command-line option.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       The file <b>debian/openvswitch-switch.init </b>in the Open vSwitch
       source distribution is a good example of how to use <b>ovs-ctl</b>.
