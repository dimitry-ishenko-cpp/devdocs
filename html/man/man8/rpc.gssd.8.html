INTRODUCTION </h2>
<pre>
       The RPCSEC_GSS protocol, defined in RFC 5403, is used to provide
       strong security for RPC-based protocols such as NFS.

       Before exchanging RPC requests using RPCSEC_GSS, an RPC client
       must establish a GSS <i>security context</i>.  A security context is
       shared state on each end of a network transport that enables GSS-
       API security services.

       Security contexts are established using <i>security credentials</i>.  A
       credential grants temporary access to a secure network service,
       much as a railway ticket grants temporary access to use a rail
       service.

       A user typically obtains a credential by providing a password to
       the <b>kinit</b>(1) command, or via a PAM library at login time.  A
       credential acquired with a <i>user principal</i> is known as a <i>user</i>
       <i>credential</i> (see <b>kerberos</b>(1) for more on principals).

       Certain operations require a credential that represents no
       particular user or represents the host itself.  This kind of
       credential is called a <i>machine credential</i>.

       A host establishes its machine credential using a <i>service</i>
       <i>principal</i> whose encrypted password is stored in a local file
       known as a <i>keytab</i>.  A machine credential remains effective
       without user intervention as long as the host can renew it.

       Once obtained, credentials are typically stored in local
       temporary files with well-known pathnames.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       To establish GSS security contexts using these credential files,
       the Linux kernel RPC client depends on a userspace daemon called
       <b>rpc.gssd</b>.  The <b>rpc.gssd </b>daemon uses the rpc_pipefs filesystem to
       communicate with the kernel.

   <b>User Credentials</b>
       When a user authenticates using a command such as <b>kinit</b>(1), the
       resulting credential is stored in a file with a well-known name
       constructed using the user's UID.

       To interact with an NFS server on behalf of a particular
       Kerberos-authenticated user, the Linux kernel RPC client requests
       that <b>rpc.gssd </b>initialize a security context with the credential
       in that user's credential file.

       Typically, credential files are placed in <i>/tmp</i>.  However,
       <b>rpc.gssd </b>can search for credential files in more than one
       directory.  See the description of the <b>-d </b>option for details.

   <b>Machine Credentials</b>
       <b>rpc.gssd </b>searches the default keytab, <i>/etc/krb5.keytab</i>, in the
       following order for a principal and password to use when
       establishing the machine credential.  For the search, rpc.gssd
       replaces &lt;hostname&gt; and &lt;REALM&gt; with the local system's hostname
       and Kerberos realm.

          &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;$@&lt;REALM&gt;
          root/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
          nfs/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
          host/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
          root/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
          nfs/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
          host/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;

       rpc.gssd selects one of the &lt;anyname&gt; entries if it does not find
       a service principal matching the local hostname, e.g. if DHCP
       assigns the local hostname dynamically.  The &lt;anyname&gt; facility
       enables the use of the same keytab on multiple systems.  However,
       using the same service principal to establish a machine
       credential on multiple hosts can create unwanted security
       exposures and is therefore not recommended.

       Note that &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;$@&lt;REALM&gt; is a user principal that enables
       Kerberized NFS when the local system is joined to an Active
       Directory domain using Samba.  The keytab provides the password
       for this principal.

       You can specify a different keytab by using the <b>-k </b>option if
       <i>/etc/krb5.keytab</i> does not exist or does not provide one of these
       principals.

   <b>Credentials for UID 0</b>
       UID 0 is a special case.  By default <b>rpc.gssd </b>uses the system's
       machine credentials for UID 0 accesses that require GSS
       authentication.  This limits the privileges of the root user when
       accessing network resources that require authentication.

       Specify the <b>-n </b>option when starting <b>rpc.gssd </b>if you'd like to
       force the root user to obtain a user credential rather than use
       the local system's machine credential.

       When <b>-n </b>is specified, the kernel continues to request a GSS
       context established with a machine credential for NFSv4
       operations, such as SETCLIENTID or RENEW, that manage state.  If
       <b>rpc.gssd </b>cannot obtain a machine credential (say, the local
       system has no keytab), NFSv4 operations that require machine
       credentials will fail.

   <b>Encryption types</b>
       A realm administrator can choose to add keys encoded in a number
       of different encryption types to the local system's keytab.  For
       instance, a host/ principal might have keys for the <b>aes256-cts-</b>
       <b>hmac-sha1-96</b>, <b>aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96</b>, <b>des3-cbc-sha1</b>, and
       <b>arcfour-hmac </b>encryption types.  This permits <b>rpc.gssd </b>to choose
       an appropriate encryption type that the target NFS server
       supports.

       These encryption types are stronger than legacy single-DES
       encryption types.  To interoperate in environments where servers
       support only weak encryption types, you can restrict your client
       to use only single-DES encryption types by specifying the <b>-l</b>
       option when starting <b>rpc.gssd</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-D     </b>The server name passed to GSSAPI for authentication is
              normally the name exactly as requested.  e.g. for NFS it
              is the server name in the "servername:/path" mount
              request.  Only if this servername appears to be an IP
              address (IPv4 or IPv6) or an unqualified name (no dots)
              will a reverse DNS lookup will be performed to get the
              canoncial server name.

              If <b>-D </b>is present, a reverse DNS lookup will <i>always</i> be
              used, even if the server name looks like a canonical name.
              So it is needed if partially qualified, or non canonical
              names are regularly used.

              Using <b>-D </b>can introduce a security vulnerability, so it is
              recommended that <b>-D </b>not be used, and that canonical names
              always be used when requesting services.

       <b>-f     </b>Runs <b>rpc.gssd </b>in the foreground and sends output to stderr
              (as opposed to syslogd)

       <b>-n     </b>When specified, UID 0 is forced to obtain user credentials
              which are used instead of the local system's machine
              credentials.

       <b>-k </b><i>keytab</i>
              Tells <b>rpc.gssd </b>to use the keys found in <i>keytab</i> to obtain
              machine credentials.  The default value is
              <i>/etc/krb5.keytab</i>.

       <b>-l     </b>When specified, restricts <b>rpc.gssd </b>to sessions to weak
              encryption types such as <b>des-cbc-crc</b>.  This option is
              available only when the local system's Kerberos library
              supports settable encryption types.

       <b>-p </b><i>path</i>
              Tells <b>rpc.gssd </b>where to look for the rpc_pipefs
              filesystem.  The default value is <i>/var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs</i>.

       <b>-d </b><i>search-path</i>
              This option specifies a colon separated list of
              directories that <b>rpc.gssd </b>searches for credential files.
              The default value is <i>/tmp:/run/user/%U</i>.  The literal
              sequence "%U" can be specified to substitue the UID of the
              user for whom credentials are being searched.

       <b>-M     </b>By default, machine credentials are stored in files in the
              first directory in the credential directory search path
              (see the <b>-d </b>option).  When <b>-M </b>is set, <b>rpc.gssd </b>stores
              machine credentials in memory instead.

       <b>-v     </b>Increases the verbosity of the output (can be specified
              multiple times).

       <b>-r     </b>If the RPCSEC_GSS library supports setting debug level,
              increases the verbosity of the output (can be specified
              multiple times).

       <b>-R </b><i>realm</i>
              Kerberos tickets from this <i>realm</i> will be preferred when
              scanning available credentials cache files to be used to
              create a context.  By default, the default realm, as
              configured in the Kerberos configuration file, is
              preferred.

       <b>-t </b><i>timeout</i>
              Timeout, in seconds, for kernel GSS contexts. This option
              allows you to force new kernel contexts to be negotiated
              after <i>timeout</i> seconds, which allows changing Kerberos
              tickets and identities frequently.  The default is no
              explicit timeout, which means the kernel context will live
              the lifetime of the Kerberos service ticket used in its
              creation.

       <b>-T </b><i>timeout</i>
              Timeout, in seconds, to create an RPC connection with a
              server while establishing an authenticated gss context for
              a user.  The default timeout is set to 5 seconds.  If you
              get messages like "WARNING: can't create tcp rpc_clnt to
              server %servername% for user with uid %uid%: RPC: Remote
              system error - Connection timed out", you should consider
              an increase of this timeout.

       <b>-U </b><i>timeout</i>
              Timeout, in seconds, for upcall threads.  Threads
              executing longer than <i>timeout</i> seconds will cause an error
              message to be logged.  The default <i>timeout</i> is 30 seconds.
              The minimum is 5 seconds.  The maximum is 600 seconds.

       <b>-C     </b>In addition to logging an error message for threads that
              have timed out, the thread will be canceled and an error
              of -ETIMEDOUT will be reported to the kernel.

       <b>-H     </b>Avoids setting $HOME to "/". This allows rpc.gssd to read
              per user k5identity files versus trying to read
              /.k5identity for each user.

              If <b>-H </b>is not set, rpc.gssd will use the first match found
              in /var/kerberos/krb5/user/$EUID/client.keytab and will
              not use a principal based on host and/or service
              parameters listed in $HOME/.k5identity.

CONFIGURATION FILE </h2>
<pre>
       Many of the options that can be set on the command line can also
       be controlled through values set in the <b>[gssd] </b>section of the
       <i>/etc/nfs.conf</i> configuration file.  Values recognized include:

       <b>verbosity</b>
              Value which is equivalent to the number of <b>-v</b>.

       <b>rpc-verbosity</b>
              Value which is equivalent to the number of <b>-r</b>.

       <b>use-memcache</b>
              A Boolean flag equivalent to <b>-M</b>.

       <b>use-machine-creds</b>
              A Boolean flag. Setting to <b>false </b>is equivalent to giving
              the <b>-n </b>flag.

       <b>avoid-dns</b>
              Setting to <b>false </b>is equivalent to providing the <b>-D </b>flag.

       <b>limit-to-legacy-enctypes</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-l</b>.

       <b>allowed-enctypes</b>
              Allows you to restrict <b>rpc.gssd </b>to using a subset of the
              encryption types permitted by the kernel and the krb5
              libraries.  This is useful if you need to interoperate
              with an NFS server that does not have support for the
              newer SHA2 and Camellia encryption types, for example.
              This configuration file option does not have an equivalent
              command-line option.

       <b>context-timeout</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-t</b>.

       <b>rpc-timeout</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-T</b>.

       <b>keytab-file</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-k</b>.

       <b>cred-cache-directory</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-d</b>.

       <b>preferred-realm</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-R</b>.

       <b>upcall-timeout</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-U</b>.

       <b>cancel-timed-out-upcalls</b>
              Setting to <b>true </b>is equivalent to providing the <b>-C </b>flag.

       <b>set-home</b>
              Setting to <b>false </b>is equivalent to providing the <b>-H </b>flag.

       In addtion, the following value is recognized from the <b>[general]</b>
       section:

       <b>pipefs-directory</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-p</b>.
