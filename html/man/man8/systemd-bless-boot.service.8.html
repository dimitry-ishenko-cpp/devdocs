NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-bless-boot.service, systemd-bless-boot - Mark current
       boot process as successful
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-bless-boot.service

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-bless-boot
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-bless-boot.service is a system service that marks the
       current boot process as successful. It's automatically pulled
       into the initial transaction when <a href="systemd-bless-boot-generator.8.html">systemd-bless-boot-generator(8)</a>
       detects that <a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a> style boot counting is used.

       Internally, the service operates based on the <i>LoaderBootCountPath</i>
       EFI variable (of the vendor UUID
       <b>4a67b082-0a4c-41cf-b6c7-440b29bb8c4f</b>), which is passed from the
       boot loader to the OS. It contains a file system path (relative
       to the EFI system partition) of the <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[1]
       compliant boot loader entry file or unified kernel image file
       that was used to boot up the system.  <b>systemd-bless-boot.service</b>
       removes the two 'tries done' and 'tries left' numeric boot
       counters from the filename, which indicates to future invocations
       of the boot loader that the entry has completed booting
       successfully at least once. (This service will hence rename the
       boot loader entry file or unified kernel image file on the first
       successful boot.)
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-bless-boot executable may also be
       invoked from the command line, taking one of the following
       command arguments:

       <b>status</b>
           The current status of the boot loader entry file or unified
           kernel image file is shown. This outputs one of "good",
           "bad", "indeterminate", "clean", depending on the state and
           previous invocations of the command. The string
           "indeterminate" is shown initially after boot, before it has
           been marked as "good" or "bad". The string "good" is shown
           after the boot was marked as "good" with the <b>good </b>command
           below, and "bad" conversely after the <b>bad </b>command was
           invoked. The string "clean" is returned when boot counting is
           currently not in effect.

           This command is implied if no command argument is specified.

           Added in version 240.

       <b>good</b>
           When invoked, the current boot loader entry file or unified
           kernel image file will be marked as "good", executing the
           file rename operation described above. This command is
           intended to be invoked at the end of a successful boot. The
           systemd-bless-boot.service unit invokes this command.

           Added in version 240.

       <b>bad</b>
           When called the 'tries left' counter in the boot loader entry
           file name or unified kernel image file name is set to zero,
           marking the boot loader entry or kernel image as "bad", so
           that the boot loader won't consider it anymore on future
           boots (at least as long as there are other entries available
           that are not marked "bad" yet). This command is normally not
           executed, but can be used to instantly put an end to the boot
           counting logic if a problem is detected and persistently mark
           the boot entry as bad.

           Added in version 240.

       <b>indeterminate</b>
           This command undoes any marking of the current boot loader
           entry file or unified kernel image file as good or bad. This
           is implemented by renaming the boot loader entry file or
           unified kernel image file back to the path encoded in the
           <i>LoaderBootCountPath</i> EFI variable.

           Added in version 240.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.
