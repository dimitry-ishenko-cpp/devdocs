NAME </h2>
<pre>
       augenrules - a script that merges component audit rule files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>augenrules </b>[<i>--check</i>] [<i>--load</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>augenrules </b>is a script that merges all component audit rules
       files, found in the audit rules directory, <i>/etc/audit/rules.d</i>,
       placing the merged file in <i>/etc/audit/audit.rules</i>. Component
       audit rule files, must end in <i>.rules</i> in order to be processed.
       All other files in <i>/etc/audit/rules.d</i> are ignored.

       The files are concatenated in order, based on their natural sort
       (see -v option of ls(1)) and stripped of empty and comment (#)
       lines.

       The last processed -<i>D</i> directive without an option, if present, is
       always emitted as the first line in the resultant file. Those
       with an option are replicated in place.  The last processed -<i>b</i>
       directive, if present, is always emitted as the second line in
       the resultant file.  The last processed -<i>f</i> directive, if present,
       is always emitted as the third line in the resultant file.  The
       last processed -<i>e</i> directive, if present, is always emitted as the
       last line in the resultant file.

       The generated file is only copied to <i>/etc/audit/audit.rules</i>, if
       it differs.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--check</b>

              overwriting audit.rules.

       <b>--load </b>load old or newly built rules into the kernel.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/audit/rules.d/ /etc/audit/audit.rules
