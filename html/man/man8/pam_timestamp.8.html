</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_timestamp - Authenticate using cached successful
       authentication attempts
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pam_timestamp.so </b>[timestampdir=<i>directory</i>]
                        [timestamp_timeout=<i>number</i>] [verbose] [debug]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       In a nutshell, <i>pam_timestamp</i> caches successful authentication
       attempts, and allows you to use a recent successful attempt as
       the basis for authentication. This is similar mechanism which is
       used in <b>sudo</b>.

       When an application opens a session using <i>pam_timestamp</i>, a
       timestamp file is created in the <i>timestampdir</i> directory for the
       user. When an application attempts to authenticate the user, a
       <i>pam_timestamp</i> will treat a sufficiently recent timestamp file as
       grounds for succeeding.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>timestampdir=</b><i>directory</i>
           Specify an alternate directory where <i>pam_timestamp</i> creates
           timestamp files.

       <b>timestamp_timeout=</b><i>number</i>
           How long should <i>pam_timestamp</i> treat timestamp as valid after
           their last modification date (in seconds). Default is 300
           seconds.

       <b>verbose</b>
           Attempt to inform the user when access is granted.

       <b>debug</b>
           Turns on debugging messages sent to <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
MODULE TYPES PROVIDED </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>auth </b>and <b>session </b>module types are provided.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           The module was not able to retrieve the user name or no valid
           timestamp file was found.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           Everything was successful.

       PAM_SESSION_ERR
           Timestamp file could not be created or updated.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Users can get confused when they are not always asked for
       passwords when running a given program. Some users reflexively
       begin typing information before noticing that it is not being
       asked for.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
           auth sufficient pam_timestamp.so verbose
           auth required   pam_unix.so

           session required pam_unix.so
           session optional pam_timestamp.so
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
