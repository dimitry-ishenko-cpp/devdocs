</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dnf-automatic - DNF Automatic
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dnf-automatic [&lt;config file&gt;]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Alternative CLI to <b>dnf upgrade </b>with specific facilities to make
       it suitable to be executed automatically and regularly from
       systemd timers, cron jobs and similar.

       The operation of the tool is usually controlled by the
       configuration file or the function-specific timer units (see
       below). The command only accepts a single optional argument
       pointing to the config file, and some control arguments intended
       for use by the services that back the timer units. If no
       configuration file is passed from the command line,
       <b>/etc/dnf/automatic.conf </b>is used.

       The tool synchronizes package metadata as needed and then checks
       for updates available for the given system and then either exits,
       downloads the packages or downloads and applies the packages. The
       outcome of the operation is then reported by a selected
       mechanism, for instance via the standard output, email or MOTD
       messages.

       The systemd timer unit <b>dnf-automatic.timer </b>will behave as the
       configuration file specifies (see below) with regard to whether
       to download and apply updates. Some other timer units are
       provided which override the configuration file with some standard
       behaviours:

       • dnf-automatic-notifyonly

       • dnf-automatic-download

       • dnf-automatic-install

       Regardless of the configuration file settings, the first will
       only notify of available updates. The second will download, but
       not install them. The third will download and install them.
</pre> <h2>
RUN DNF-AUTOMATIC </h2>
<pre>
       You can select one that most closely fits your needs, customize
       <b>/etc/dnf/automatic.conf </b>for any specific behaviors, and enable
       the timer unit.

       For example: <b>systemctl enable --now</b>
       <b>dnf-automatic-notifyonly.timer</b>
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The configuration file is separated into topical sections.

   <b>[commands] section</b>
       Setting the mode of operation of the program.

       <b>apply_updates</b>
              boolean, default: False

              Whether packages comprising the available updates should
              be applied by <b>dnf-automatic.timer</b>, i.e. installed via RPM.
              Implies <b>download_updates</b>. Note that if this is set to
              <b>False</b>, downloaded packages will be left in the cache till
              the next successful DNF transaction. Note that the other
              timer units override this setting.

       <b>download_updates</b>
              boolean, default: False

              Whether packages comprising the available updates should
              be downloaded by <b>dnf-automatic.timer</b>. Note that the other
              timer units override this setting.

       <b>network_online_timeout</b>
              time in seconds, default: 60

              Maximal time dnf-automatic will wait until the system is
              online. 0 means that network availability detection will
              be skipped.

       <b>random_sleep</b>
              time in seconds, default: 0

              Maximal random delay before downloading.  Note that, by
              default, the <b>systemd </b>timers also apply a random delay of
              up to 1 hour.

       <b>upgrade_type</b>
              either one of <b>default</b>, <b>security</b>, default: <b>default</b>

              What kind of upgrades to look at. <b>default </b>signals looking
              for all available updates, <b>security </b>only those with an
              issued security advisory.

       <b>reboot </b>either one of <b>never</b>, <b>when-changed</b>, <b>when-needed</b>, default:
              <b>never</b>

              When the system should reboot following upgrades. <b>never</b>
              does not reboot the system. <b>when-changed </b>triggers a reboot
              after any upgrade. <b>when-needed </b>triggers a reboot only when
              rebooting is necessary to apply changes, such as when
              systemd or the kernel is upgraded.

       <b>reboot_command</b>
              string, default: <b>shutdown -r +5 'Rebooting after applying</b>
              <b>package updates'</b>

              Specify the command to run to trigger a reboot of the
              system. For example, to skip the 5-minute delay and wall
              message, use <b>shutdown -r</b>
