SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sudoreplay </b>[<b>-FhnRS</b>] [<b>-d </b><i>dir</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-m </b><i>num</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>num</i>]
       ID[<i>@offset</i>]

       <b>sudoreplay </b>[<b>-h</b>] [<b>-d </b><i>dir</i>] <b>-l </b>[search expression]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sudoreplay </b>plays back or lists the output logs created by <b>sudo</b>.
       When replaying, <b>sudoreplay </b>can play the session back in real-
       time, or the playback speed may be adjusted (faster or slower)
       based on the command line options.

       The <i>ID</i> should either be a six character sequence of digits and
       upper case letters, e.g., “0100A5” or a path name.  The <i>ID</i> may
       include an optional <i>@offset</i> suffix which may be used to start
       replaying at a specific time offset.  The <i>@offset</i> is specified as
       a number in seconds since the start of the session with an
       optional decimal fraction.

       Path names may be relative to the I/O log directory
       <i>/var/log/sudo-io</i> (unless overridden by the <b>-d </b>option) or fully
       qualified, beginning with a ‘/’ character.  When a command is run
       via <b>sudo </b>with <i>log_output</i> enabled in the <i>sudoers</i> file, a “TSID=ID”
       string is logged via <i>syslog</i>(3) or to the <b>sudo </b>log file.  The <i>ID</i>
       may also be determined using <b>sudoreplay</b>'s list mode.

       In list mode, <b>sudoreplay </b>can be used to find the ID of a session
       based on a number of criteria such as the user, tty, or command
       run.

       In replay mode, if the standard input and output are connected to
       a terminal and the <b>-n </b>option is not specified, <b>sudoreplay </b>will
       operate interactively.  In interactive mode, <b>sudoreplay </b>will
       attempt to adjust the terminal size to match that of the session
       and write directly to the terminal (not all terminals support
       this).  Additionally, it will poll the keyboard and act on the
       following keys:

       ‘<b>\n</b>’ or ‘<b>\r</b>’  Skip to the next replay event; useful for long
                     pauses.

       ‘ ’ (space)   Pause output; press any key to resume.

       ‘&lt;’           Reduce the playback speed by one half.

       ‘&gt;’           Double the playback speed.

       The session can be interrupted via control-C.  When the session
       has finished, the terminal is restored to its original size if it
       was changed during playback.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-d </b><i>dir</i>, <b>--directory</b>=<i>dir</i>
               Store session logs in <i>dir</i> instead of the default,
               <i>/var/log/sudo-io</i>.

       <b>-f </b><i>filter</i>, <b>--filter</b>=<i>filter</i>
               Select which I/O type(s) to display.  By default,
               <b>sudoreplay </b>will display the command's standard output,
               standard error, and tty output.  The <i>filter</i> argument is a
               comma-separated list, consisting of one or more of
               following: <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>, <i>stderr</i>, <i>ttyin</i>, and <i>ttyout</i>.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--follow</b>
               Enable “follow mode”.  When replaying a session,
               <b>sudoreplay </b>will ignore end-of-file and keep replaying
               until the log is complete.  This can be used to replay a
               session that is still in progress, similar to “tail -f”.
               An I/O log file is considered to be complete when the
               write bits have been cleared on the session's timing
               file.  Versions of <b>sudo </b>prior to 1.9.1 do not clear the
               write bits upon completion.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               Display a short help message to the standard output and
               exit.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list </b>[<i>search expression</i>]
               Enable “list mode”.  In this mode, <b>sudoreplay </b>will list
               available sessions in a format similar to the <b>sudo </b>log
               file format, sorted by file name (or sequence number).
               Any control characters present in the log data are
               formatted in octal with a leading ‘#’ character.  For
               example, a horizontal tab is displayed as ‘#011’ and an
               embedded carriage return is displayed as ‘#015’.  Space
               characters in the command name and arguments are also
               formatted in octal.

               If a <i>search expression</i> is specified, it will be used to
               restrict the IDs that are displayed.  An expression is
               composed of the following predicates:

               command <i>pattern</i>
                       Evaluates to true if the command run matches the
                       POSIX extended regular expression <i>pattern</i>.

               cwd <i>directory</i>
                       Evaluates to true if the command was run with the
                       specified current working directory.

               fromdate <i>date</i>
                       Evaluates to true if the command was run on or
                       after <i>date</i>.  See “Date and time format” for a
                       description of supported date and time formats.

               group <i>runas_group</i>
                       Evaluates to true if the command was run with the
                       specified <i>runas_group</i>.  Unless a <i>runas_group</i> was
                       explicitly specified when <b>sudo </b>was run this field
                       will be empty in the log.

               host <i>hostname</i>
                       Evaluates to true if the command was run on the
                       specified <i>hostname</i>.

               runas <i>runas_user</i>
                       Evaluates to true if the command was run as the
                       specified <i>runas_user</i>.  By default, <b>sudo </b>runs
                       commands as the <b>root </b>user.

               todate <i>date</i>
                       Evaluates to true if the command was run on or
                       prior to <i>date</i>.  See “Date and time format” for a
                       description of supported date and time formats.

               tty <i>tty name</i>
                       Evaluates to true if the command was run on the
                       specified terminal device.  The <i>tty name</i> should
                       be specified without the <i>/dev/</i> prefix, e.g.,
                       <i>tty01</i> instead of <i>/dev/tty01</i>.

               user <i>user name</i>
                       Evaluates to true if the ID matches a command run
                       by <i>user name</i>.

               Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique
               string.

               Predicates may be combined using <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, and <i>!</i> operators
               as well as ‘(’ and ‘)’ grouping (parentheses must
               generally be escaped from the shell).  The <i>and</i> operator
               is optional, adjacent predicates have an implied <i>and</i>
               unless separated by an <i>or</i>.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--max-wait </b><i>max_wait</i>
               Specify an upper bound on how long to wait between key
               presses or output data.  By default, <b>sudoreplay </b>will
               accurately reproduce the delays between key presses or
               program output.  However, this can be tedious when the
               session includes long pauses.  When the <b>-m </b>option is
               specified, <b>sudoreplay </b>will limit these pauses to at most
               <i>max_wait</i> seconds.  The value may be specified as a
               floating point number, e.g., <i>2.5</i>.  A <i>max_wait</i> of zero or
               less will eliminate the pauses entirely.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--non-interactive</b>
               Do not prompt for user input or attempt to re-size the
               terminal.  The session is written to the standard output,
               not directly to the user's terminal.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--no-resize</b>
               Do not attempt to re-size the terminal to match the
               terminal size of the session.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--suspend-wait</b>
               Wait while the command was suspended.  By default,
               <b>sudoreplay </b>will ignore the time interval between when the
               command was suspended and when it was resumed.  If the <b>-S</b>
               option is specified, <b>sudoreplay </b>will wait instead.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--speed </b><i>speed_factor</i>
               This option causes <b>sudoreplay </b>to adjust the number of
               seconds it will wait between key presses or program
               output.  This can be used to slow down or speed up the
               display.  For example, a <i>speed_factor</i> of <i>2</i> would make the
               output twice as fast whereas a <i>speed_factor</i> of <i>.5</i> would
               make the output twice as slow.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Print the <b>sudoreplay </b>versions version number and exit.

   <b>Date and time format</b>
       The time and date may be specified multiple ways, common formats
       include:

       HH:MM:SS am MM/DD/CCYY timezone
               24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm.

       HH:MM:SS am Month, Day Year timezone
               24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm, and month and
               day names may be abbreviated.  Month and day of the week
               names must be specified in English.

       CCYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
               ISO time format

       DD Month CCYY HH:MM:SS
               The month name may be abbreviated.

       Either time or date may be omitted, the am/pm and timezone are
       optional.  If no date is specified, the current day is assumed;
       if no time is specified, the first second of the specified date
       is used.  The less significant parts of both time and date may
       also be omitted, in which case zero is assumed.

       The following are all valid time and date specifications:

       now     The current time and date.

       tomorrow
               Exactly one day from now.

       yesterday
               24 hours ago.

       2 hours ago
               2 hours ago.

       next Friday
               The first second of the Friday in the next (upcoming)
               week.  Not to be confused with “this Friday” which would
               match the Friday of the current week.

       last week
               The current time but 7 days ago.  This is equivalent to
               “a week ago”.

       a fortnight ago
               The current time but 14 days ago.

       10:01 am 9/17/2009
               10:01 am, September 17, 2009.

       10:01 am
               10:01 am on the current day.

       10      10:00 am on the current day.

       9/17/2009
               00:00 am, September 17, 2009.

       10:01 am Sep 17, 2009
               10:01 am, September 17, 2009.

       Relative time specifications do not always work as expected.  For
       example, the “next” qualifier is intended to be used in
       conjunction with a day such as “next Monday”.  When used with
       units of weeks, months, years, etc the result will be one more
       than expected.  For example, “next week” will result in a time
       exactly two weeks from now, which is probably not what was
       intended.  This will be addressed in a future version of
       <b>sudoreplay</b>.

   <b>Debugging sudoreplay</b>
       <b>sudoreplay </b>versions 1.8.4 and higher support a flexible debugging
       framework that is configured via <i>Debug</i> lines in the <i>sudo.conf</i>(5)
       file.

       For more information on configuring <i>sudo.conf</i>(5), refer to its
       manual.
