</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>numastat </b>with no command options or arguments at all, displays
       per-node NUMA hit and miss system statistics from the kernel
       memory allocator.  This default <b>numastat </b>behavior is strictly
       compatible with the previous long-standing <b>numastat </b>perl script,
       written by Andi Kleen.  The default <b>numastat </b>statistics shows
       per-node numbers (in units of pages of memory) in these
       categories:

       <b>numa_hit </b>is memory successfully allocated on this node as
       intended.

       <b>numa_miss </b>is memory allocated on this node despite the process
       preferring some different node. Each <i>numa_miss</i> has a <i>numa_foreign</i>
       on another node.

       <b>numa_foreign </b>is memory intended for this node, but actually
       allocated on some different node.  Each <i>numa_foreign</i> has a
       <i>numa_miss</i> on another node.

       <b>interleave_hit </b>is interleaved memory successfully allocated on
       this node as intended.

       <b>local_node </b>is memory allocated on this node while a process was
       running on it.

       <b>other_node </b>is memory allocated on this node while a process was
       running on some other node.

       Any supplied options or arguments with the <b>numastat </b>command will
       significantly change both the content and the format of the
       display.  Specified options will cause display units to change to
       megabytes of memory, and will change other specific behaviors of
       <b>numastat </b>as described below.

       Memory usage information reflects the resident pages on the
       system.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-c     </b>Minimize table display width by dynamically shrinking
              column widths based on data contents.  With this option,
              amounts of memory will be rounded to the nearest megabyte
              (rather than the usual display with two decimal places).
              Column width and inter-column spacing will be somewhat
              unpredictable with this option, but the more dense display
              will be very useful on systems with many NUMA nodes.

       <b>-m     </b>Show the meminfo-like system-wide memory usage
              information.  This option produces a per-node breakdown of
              memory usage information similar to that found in
              /proc/meminfo.

       <b>-n     </b>Show the original <b>numastat </b>statistics info.  This will
              show the same information as the default <b>numastat </b>behavior
              but the units will be megabytes of memory, and there will
              be other formatting and layout changes versus the original
              <b>numastat </b>behavior.

       <b>-p </b>&lt;<b>PID</b>&gt; or &lt;<b>pattern</b>&gt;
              Show per-node memory allocation information for the
              specified PID or pattern.  If the -p argument is only
              digits, it is assumed to be a numerical PID.  If the
              argument characters are not only digits, it is assumed to
              be a text fragment pattern to search for in process
              command lines.  For example, <b>numastat -p qemu </b>will attempt
              to find and show information for processes with "qemu" in
              the command line.  Any command line arguments remaining
              after <b>numastat </b>option flag processing is completed, are
              assumed to be additional &lt;<b>PID</b>&gt; or &lt;<b>pattern</b>&gt; process
              specifiers.  In this sense, the <b>-p </b>option flag is
              optional: <b>numastat qemu </b>is equivalent to <b>numastat -p qemu</b>

       <b>-s[&lt;node&gt;]</b>
              Sort the table data in descending order before displaying
              it, so the biggest memory consumers are listed first.
              With no specified &lt;node&gt;, the table will be sorted by the
              total column.  If the optional &lt;node&gt; argument is
              supplied, the data will be sorted by the &lt;node&gt; column.
              Note that &lt;node&gt; must follow the <b>-s </b>immediately with no
              intermediate white space (e.g., <b>numastat -s2</b>). Because <b>-s</b>
              can allow an optional argument, it must always be the last
              option character in a compound option character string.
              For example, instead of <b>numastat -msc </b>(which probably will
              not work as you expect), use <b>numastat -mcs</b>

       <b>-v     </b>Make some reports more verbose.  In particular, process
              information for multiple processes will display detailed
              information for each process.  Normally when per-node
              information for multiple processes is displayed, only the
              total lines are shown.

       <b>-V     </b>Display <b>numastat </b>version information and exit.

       <b>-z     </b>Skip display of table rows and columns of only zero
              valuess.  This can be used to greatly reduce the amount of
              uninteresting zero data on systems with many NUMA nodes.
              Note that when rows or columns of zeros are still
              displayed with this option, that probably means there is
              at least one value in the row or column that is actually
              non-zero, but rounded to zero for display.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>numastat </b>attempts to fold each table display so it will be
       conveniently readable on the output terminal.  Normally a
       terminal width of 80 characters is assumed.  When the <b>resize</b>
       command is available, <b>numastat </b>attempts to dynamically determine
       and fine tune the output tty width from <b>resize </b>output.  If
       <b>numastat </b>output is not to a tty, very long output lines can be
       produced, depending on how many NUMA nodes are present.  In all
       cases, output width can be explicitly specified via the
       <b>NUMASTAT_WIDTH </b>environment variable.  For example,
       <b>NUMASTAT_WIDTH=100  numastat</b>.  On systems with many NUMA nodes,
       <b>numastat -c -z .... </b>can be very helpful to selectively reduce the
       amount of displayed information.

AUTHORS </h2>
<pre>
       The original <b>numastat </b>perl script was written circa 2003 by Andi
       Kleen &lt;andi.kleen@intel.com&gt;.  The current <b>numastat </b>program was
       written in 2012 by Bill Gray &lt;bgray@redhat.com&gt; to be compatible
       by default with the original, and to add options to display per-
       node system memory usage and per-node process memory allocation.
