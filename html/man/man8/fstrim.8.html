NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fstrim - discard unused blocks on a mounted filesystem
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>fstrim </b>[<b>-Aav</b>] [<b>-o </b><i>offset</i>] [<b>-l </b><i>length</i>] [<b>-m </b><i>minimum-size</i>]
       [<i>mountpoint</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>fstrim </b>is used on a mounted filesystem to discard (or "trim")
       blocks which are not in use by the filesystem. This is useful for
       solid-state drives (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage.

       By default, <b>fstrim </b>will discard all unused blocks in the
       filesystem. Options may be used to modify this behavior based on
       range or size, as explained below.

       The <i>mountpoint</i> argument is the pathname of the directory where
       the filesystem is mounted and is required when <i>-A, -a, --fstab,</i>
       <i>or --all are unspecified.</i>

       <i>Running</i> <b>fstrim </b><i>frequently, or even using</i> <b>mount -o discard</b><i>, might</i>
       <i>negatively affect the lifetime of poor-quality SSD devices. For</i>
       <i>most desktop and server systems a sufficient trimming frequency</i>
       <i>is once a week. Note that not all devices support a queued trim,</i>
       <i>so each trim command incurs a performance penalty on whatever</i>
       <i>else might be trying to use the disk at the time.</i>
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>offset</i>, <i>length</i>, and <i>minimum-size</i> arguments may be followed by
       the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so
       on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional,
       e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes KB
       (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and
       YB.

       <b>-A, --fstab</b>
           Trim all mounted filesystems mentioned in <i>/etc/fstab</i> on
           devices that support the discard operation. The root
           filesystem is determined from kernel command line if missing
           in the file. The other supplied options, like <b>--offset</b>,
           <b>--length </b>and <b>--minimum</b>, are applied to all these devices.
           Errors from filesystems that do not support the discard
           operation, read-only devices, autofs and read-only
           filesystems are silently ignored. Filesystems with
           "X-fstrim.notrim" mount option are skipped.

       <b>-a, --all</b>
           Trim all mounted filesystems on devices that support the
           discard operation. The other supplied options, like <b>--offset</b>,
           <b>--length </b>and <b>--minimum</b>, are applied to all these devices.
           Errors from filesystems that do not support the discard
           operation, read-only devices and read-only filesystems are
           silently ignored.

       <b>-n, --dry-run</b>
           This option does everything apart from actually call <b>FITRIM</b>
           ioctl.

       <b>-o, --offset </b><i>offset</i>
           Byte offset in the filesystem from which to begin searching
           for free blocks to discard. The default value is zero,
           starting at the beginning of the filesystem.

       <b>-l, --length </b><i>length</i>
           The number of bytes (after the starting point) to search for
           free blocks to discard. If the specified value extends past
           the end of the filesystem, <b>fstrim </b>will stop at the filesystem
           size boundary. The default value extends to the end of the
           filesystem.

       <b>-I, --listed-in </b><i>list</i>
           Specifies a colon-separated list of files in fstab or kernel
           mountinfo format. All missing or empty files are silently
           ignored. The evaluation of the <i>list</i> stops after first
           non-empty file. For example:

           <b>--listed-in /etc/fstab:/proc/self/mountinfo</b>.

           Filesystems with "X-fstrim.notrim" mount option in fstab are
           skipped.

       <b>-m, --minimum </b><i>minimum-size</i>
           Minimum contiguous free range to discard, in bytes. (This
           value is internally rounded up to a multiple of the
           filesystem block size.) Free ranges smaller than this will be
           ignored and <b>fstrim </b>will adjust the minimum if it’s smaller
           than the device’s minimum, and report that
           (fstrim_range.minlen) back to userspace. By increasing this
           value, the <b>fstrim </b>operation will complete more quickly for
           filesystems with badly fragmented freespace, although not all
           blocks will be discarded. The default value is zero,
           discarding every free block.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--types </b><i>list</i>
           Specifies allowed or forbidden filesystem types when used
           with <b>--all </b>or <b>--fstab</b>. The <i>list</i> is a comma-separated list of
           the filesystem names. The <i>list</i> follows how <b>mount -t </b>evaluates
           type patterns. Only specified filesystem types are allowed.
           All specified types are forbidden if the list is prefixed by
           "no" or each filesystem prefixed by "no" is forbidden. If the
           option is not used, then all filesystems (except "autofs")
           are allowed.

       <b>-v, --verbose</b>
           Verbose execution. With this option <b>fstrim </b>will output the
           number of bytes passed from the filesystem down the block
           stack to the device for potential discard. This number is a
           maximum discard amount from the storage device’s perspective,
           because <i>FITRIM</i> ioctl called repeated will keep sending the
           same sectors for discard repeatedly.

           <b>fstrim </b>will report the same potential discard bytes each
           time, but only sectors which had been written to between the
           discards would actually be discarded by the storage device.
           Further, the kernel block layer reserves the right to adjust
           the discard ranges to fit raid stripe geometry, non-trim
           capable devices in a LVM setup, etc. These reductions would
           not be reflected in fstrim_range.len (the <b>--length </b>option).

       <b>--quiet-unsupported</b>
           Suppress error messages if trim operation (ioctl) is
           unsupported. This option is meant to be used in <b>systemd</b>
           service file or in <a href="cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> scripts to hide warnings that are
           result of known problems, such as NTFS driver reporting <i>Bad</i>
           <i>file descriptor</i> when device is mounted read-only, or lack of
           file system support for ioctl <i>FITRIM</i> call. This option also
           cleans exit status when unsupported filesystem specified on
           <b>fstrim </b>command line.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>

       64
           some filesystem discards have succeeded, some failed

       The command <b>fstrim --all </b>returns 0 (all succeeded), 32 (all
       failed) or 64 (some failed, some succeeded).
