NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rpmgraph - Display RPM Package Dependency Graph
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>rpmgraph </b><i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>rpmgraph </b>uses <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> arguments to generate a package depen‐
       dency graph.  Each <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> argument is read and added to an
       rpm transaction set.  The elements of the transaction set are
       partially ordered using a topological sort.  The partially or‐
       dered elements are then printed to standard output.

       Nodes in the dependency graph are package names, and edges in the
       directed graph point to the parent of each node.  The parent node
       is defined as the last predecessor of a package when partially
       ordered using the package dependencies as a relation.  That means
       that the parent of a given package is the package's last prereq‐
       uisite.

       The output is in <b>dot</b>(1) directed graph format, and can be dis‐
       played or printed using the <b>dotty </b>graph editor from the <b>graphviz</b>
       package.  There are no <b>rpmgraph </b>specific options, only common <b>rpm</b>
       options.  See the <b>rpmgraph </b>usage message for what is currently
       implemented.
