</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big
       tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at <i>/</i>. These files can be spread
       out over several devices. The <b>mount </b>command serves to attach the
       filesystem found on some device to the big file tree. Conversely,
       the <a href="umount.8.html">umount(8)</a> command will detach it again. The filesystem is
       used to control how data is stored on the device or provided in a
       virtual way by network or other services.

       The standard form of the <b>mount </b>command is:

          <b>mount -t </b><i>type device dir</i>

       This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on <i>device</i>
       (which is of type <i>type</i>) at the directory <i>dir</i>. The option <b>-t </b><i>type</i>
       is optional. The <b>mount </b>command is usually able to detect a
       filesystem. The root permissions are necessary to mount a
       filesystem by default. See section "Non-superuser mounts" below
       for more details. The previous contents (if any) and owner and
       mode of <i>dir</i> become invisible, and as long as this filesystem
       remains mounted, the pathname <i>dir</i> refers to the root of the
       filesystem on <i>device</i>.

       If only the directory or the device is given, for example:

          <b>mount </b><i>/dir</i>

       then <b>mount </b>looks for a mountpoint (and if not found then for a
       device) in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file. It’s possible to use the <b>--target</b>
       or <b>--source </b>options to avoid ambiguous interpretation of the
       given argument. For example:

          <b>mount --target </b><i>/mountpoint</i>

       The same filesystem may be mounted more than once, and in some
       cases (e.g., network filesystems) the same filesystem may be
       mounted on the same mountpoint multiple times. The <b>mount </b>command
       does not implement any policy to control this behavior. All
       behavior is controlled by the kernel and it is usually specific
       to the filesystem driver. The exception is <b>--all</b>, in this case
       already mounted filesystems are ignored (see <b>--all </b>below for more
       details).

   <b>Listing the mounts</b>
       The listing mode is maintained for backward compatibility only.

       For more robust and customizable output use <a href="findmnt.8.html">findmnt(8)</a>,
       <b>especially in your scripts</b>. Note that control characters in the
       mountpoint name are replaced with '?'.

       The following command lists all mounted filesystems (of type
       <i>type</i>):

          <b>mount </b>[<b>-l</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>type</i>]

       The option <b>-l </b>adds labels to this listing. See below.

   <b>Indicating the device and filesystem</b>
       Most devices are indicated by a filename (of a block special
       device), like <i>/dev/sda1</i>, but there are other possibilities. For
       example, in the case of an NFS mount, <i>device</i> may look like
       <i>knuth.cwi.nl:/dir</i>.

       The device names of disk partitions are unstable; hardware
       reconfiguration, and adding or removing a device can cause
       changes in names. This is the reason why it’s strongly
       recommended to use filesystem or partition identifiers like UUID
       or LABEL. Currently supported identifiers (tags):

       LABEL=<i>label</i>
           Human readable filesystem identifier. See also <b>-L</b>.

       UUID=<i>uuid</i>
           Filesystem universally unique identifier. The format of the
           UUID is usually a series of hex digits separated by hyphens.
           See also <b>-U</b>.

           Note that <b>mount </b>uses UUIDs as strings. The UUIDs from the
           command line or from <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a> are not converted to internal
           binary representation. The string representation of the UUID
           should be based on lower case characters.

       PARTLABEL=<i>label</i>
           Human readable partition identifier. This identifier is
           independent on filesystem and does not change by <b>mkfs </b>or
           <b>mkswap </b>operations. It’s supported for example for GUID
           Partition Tables (GPT).

       PARTUUID=<i>uuid</i>
           Partition universally unique identifier. This identifier is
           independent on filesystem and does not change by <b>mkfs </b>or
           <b>mkswap </b>operations. It’s supported for example for GUID
           Partition Tables (GPT).

       ID=<i>id</i>
           Hardware block device ID as generated by udevd. This
           identifier is usually based on WWN (unique storage
           identifier) and assigned by the hardware manufacturer. See <b>ls</b>
           <b>/dev/disk/by-id </b>for more details, this directory and running
           udevd is required. This identifier is not recommended for
           generic use as the identifier is not strictly defined and it
           depends on udev, udev rules and hardware.

       The command <b>lsblk --fs </b>provides an overview of filesystems,
       LABELs and UUIDs on available block devices. The command <b>blkid -p</b>
       <b>&lt;device&gt; </b>provides details about a filesystem on the specified
       device.

       Don’t forget that there is no guarantee that UUIDs and labels are
       really unique, especially if you move, share or copy the device.
       Use <b>lsblk -o +UUID,PARTUUID </b>to verify that the UUIDs are really
       unique in your system.

       The recommended setup is to use tags (e.g. <b>UUID</b>=<i>uuid</i>) rather than
       <i>/dev/disk/by-{label,uuid,id,partuuid,partlabel}</i> udev symlinks in
       the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file. Tags are more readable, robust and portable.
       The <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> command internally uses udev symlinks, so the use of
       symlinks in <i>/etc/fstab</i> has no advantage over tags. For more
       details see <a href="../man3/libblkid.3.html">libblkid(3)</a>.

       The <i>proc</i> filesystem is not associated with a special device, and
       when mounting it, an arbitrary keyword - for example, <i>proc</i> - can
       be used instead of a device specification. (The customary choice
       <i>none</i> is less fortunate: the error message 'none already mounted'
       from <b>mount </b>can be confusing.)

   <b>The files /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts</b>
       The file <i>/etc/fstab</i> (see <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a>), may contain lines describing
       what devices are usually mounted where, using which options. The
       default location of the <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a> file can be overridden with the
       <b>--fstab </b><i>path</i> command-line option (see below for more details).

       The command

          <b>mount -a </b>[<b>-t </b><i>type</i>] [<b>-O </b><i>optlist</i>]

       (usually given in a bootscript) causes all filesystems mentioned
       in <i>fstab</i> (of the proper type and/or having or not having the
       proper options) to be mounted as indicated, except for those
       whose line contains the <b>noauto </b>keyword. Adding the <b>-F </b>option will
       make <b>mount </b>fork, so that the filesystems are mounted in parallel.

       When mounting a filesystem mentioned in <i>fstab</i> or <i>mtab</i>, it
       suffices to specify on the command line only the device, or only
       the mount point.

       The programs <b>mount </b>and <a href="umount.8.html">umount(8)</a> traditionally maintained a list
       of currently mounted filesystems in the file <i>/etc/mtab</i>. The
       support for regular classic <i>/etc/mtab</i> is completely disabled at
       compile time by default, because on current Linux systems it is
       better to make <i>/etc/mtab</i> a symlink to <i>/proc/mounts</i> instead. The
       regular <i>mtab</i> file maintained in userspace cannot reliably work
       with namespaces, containers and other advanced Linux features. If
       the regular <i>mtab</i> support is enabled, then it’s possible to use
       the file as well as the symlink.

       If no arguments are given to <b>mount</b>, the list of mounted
       filesystems is printed.

       If you want to override mount options from <i>/etc/fstab</i>, you have
       to use the <b>-o </b>option:

          <b>mount </b><i>device</i>|<i>dir</i> <b>-o </b><i>options</i>

       and then the mount options from the command line will be appended
       to the list of options from <i>/etc/fstab</i>. This default behaviour
       can be changed using the <b>--options-mode </b>command-line option. The
       usual behavior is that the last option wins if there are
       conflicting ones.

       The <b>mount </b>program does not read the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file if both
       <i>device</i> (or LABEL, UUID, ID, PARTUUID or PARTLABEL) and <i>dir</i> are
       specified. For example, to mount device <b>foo </b>at <b>/dir</b>:

          <b>mount /dev/foo /dir</b>

       This default behaviour can be changed by using the
       <b>--options-source-force </b>command-line option to always read
       configuration from <i>fstab</i>. For non-root users <b>mount </b>always reads
       the <i>fstab</i> configuration.

   <b>Non-superuser mounts</b>
       Normally, only the superuser can mount filesystems. However, when
       <i>fstab</i> contains the <b>user </b>option on a line, anybody can mount the
       corresponding filesystem.

       Thus, given a line

          <b>/dev/cdrom /cd iso9660 ro,user,noauto,unhide</b>

       any user can mount the iso9660 filesystem found on an inserted
       CDROM using the command:

          <b>mount /cd</b>

       Note that <b>mount </b>is very strict about non-root users and all paths
       specified on command line are verified before <i>fstab</i> is parsed or
       a helper program is executed. It’s strongly recommended to use a
       valid mountpoint to specify filesystem, otherwise <b>mount </b>may fail.
       For example it’s a bad idea to use NFS or CIFS source on command
       line.

       Since util-linux 2.35, <b>mount </b>does not exit when user permissions
       are inadequate according to libmount’s internal security rules.
       Instead, it drops suid permissions and continues as regular
       non-root user. This behavior supports use-cases where root
       permissions are not necessary (e.g., fuse filesystems, user
       namespaces, etc).

       For more details, see <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a>. Only the user that mounted a
       filesystem can unmount it again. If any user should be able to
       unmount it, then use <b>users </b>instead of <b>user </b>in the <i>fstab</i> line. The
       <b>owner </b>option is similar to the <b>user </b>option, with the restriction
       that the user must be the owner of the special file. This may be
       useful e.g. for <i>/dev/fd</i> if a login script makes the console user
       owner of this device. The <b>group </b>option is similar, with the
       restriction that the user must be a member of the group of the
       special file.

       The <b>user </b>mount option is accepted if no username is specified. If
       used in the format <b>user=someone</b>, the option is silently ignored
       and visible only for external mount helpers (/sbin/mount.&lt;type&gt;)
       for compatibility with some network filesystems.

   <b>Bind mount operation</b>
       Remount part of the file hierarchy somewhere else. The call is:

          <b>mount --bind </b><i>olddir newdir</i>

       or by using this <i>fstab</i> entry:

          <b>/</b><i>olddir</i> <b>/</b><i>newdir</i> <b>none bind</b>

       After this call the same contents are accessible in two places.

       It is important to understand that "bind" does not create any
       second-class or special node in the kernel VFS. The "bind" is
       just another operation to attach a filesystem. There is nowhere
       stored information that the filesystem has been attached by a
       "bind" operation. The <i>olddir</i> and <i>newdir</i> are independent and the
       <i>olddir</i> may be unmounted.

       One can also remount a single file (on a single file). It’s also
       possible to use a bind mount to create a mountpoint from a
       regular directory, for example:

          <b>mount --bind foo foo</b>

       The bind mount call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem,
       not possible submounts. The entire file hierarchy including
       submounts can be attached a second place by using:

          <b>mount --rbind </b><i>olddir newdir</i>

       Note that the filesystem mount options maintained by the kernel
       will remain the same as those on the original mount point. The
       userspace mount options (e.g., _netdev) will not be copied by
       <b>mount </b>and it’s necessary to explicitly specify the options on the
       <b>mount </b>command line.

       Since util-linux 2.27 <b>mount </b>permits changing the mount options by
       passing the relevant options along with <b>--bind</b>. For example:

          <b>mount -o bind,ro foo foo</b>

       This feature is not supported by the Linux kernel; it is
       implemented in userspace by an additional <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> remounting
       system call. This solution is not atomic.

       The alternative (classic) way to create a read-only bind mount is
       to use the remount operation, for example:

          <b>mount --bind </b><i>olddir newdir</i>

          <b>mount -o remount,bind,ro </b><i>olddir newdir</i>

       Note that a read-only bind will create a read-only mountpoint
       (VFS entry), but the original filesystem superblock will still be
       writable, meaning that the <i>olddir</i> will be writable, but the
       <i>newdir</i> will be read-only.

       It’s also possible to change nosuid, nodev, noexec, noatime,
       nodiratime, relatime and nosymfollow VFS entry flags via a
       "remount,bind" operation. The other flags (for example
       filesystem-specific flags) are silently ignored. The classic
       <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> system call does not allow to change mount options
       recursively (for example with <b>-o rbind,ro</b>). The recursive
       semantic is possible with a new <a href="../man2/mount_setattr.2.html">mount_setattr(2)</a> kernel system
       call and it’s supported since libmount from util-linux v2.39 by a
       new experimental "recursive" option argument (e.g. <b>-o</b>
       <b>rbind,ro=recursive</b>). For more details see the
       <b>FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS </b>section.

       Since util-linux 2.31, <b>mount </b>ignores the <b>bind </b>flag from
       <i>/etc/fstab</i> on a <b>remount </b>operation (if <b>-o remount </b>is specified on
       command line). This is necessary to fully control mount options
       on remount by command line. In previous versions the bind flag
       has been always applied and it was impossible to re-define mount
       options without interaction with the bind semantic. This <b>mount</b>
       behavior does not affect situations when "remount,bind" is
       specified in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file.

       Since util-linux 2.39, <b>mount </b>may use the new kernel mount API if
       it is available. This new kernel interface provides a more
       precise way to work with mountpoint attributes. For example, the
       <b>-o bind,rw </b>operation will create a read-write node even if the
       original node was read-only. This was impossible with the old
       classic mount(2) syscall, where the read-only VFS flag was
       inherited from the original node.

   <b>The move operation</b>
       Move a <b>mounted tree </b>to another place (atomically). The call is:

          <b>mount --move </b><i>olddir newdir</i>

       This will cause the contents which previously appeared under
       <i>olddir</i> to now be accessible under <i>newdir</i>. The physical location
       of the files is not changed. Note that <i>olddir</i> has to be a
       mountpoint.

       Note also that moving a mount residing under a shared mount is
       invalid and unsupported. Use <b>findmnt -o TARGET,PROPAGATION </b>to see
       the current propagation flags.

   <b>Shared subtree operations</b>
       Since Linux 2.6.15 it is possible to mark a mount and its
       submounts as shared, private, slave or unbindable. A shared mount
       provides the ability to create mirrors of that mount such that
       mounts and unmounts within any of the mirrors propagate to the
       other mirror. A slave mount receives propagation from its master,
       but not vice versa. A private mount carries no propagation
       abilities. An unbindable mount is a private mount which cannot be
       cloned through a bind operation. The detailed semantics are
       documented in <i>Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt</i> file in
       the kernel source tree; see also <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>.

       Supported operations are:

           mount --make-shared mountpoint
           mount --make-slave mountpoint
           mount --make-private mountpoint
           mount --make-unbindable mountpoint

       The following commands allow one to recursively change the type
       of all the mounts under a given mountpoint.

           mount --make-rshared mountpoint
           mount --make-rslave mountpoint
           mount --make-rprivate mountpoint
           mount --make-runbindable mountpoint

       <b>mount does not read fstab</b>(5) when a <b>--make-</b>* operation is
       requested. All necessary information has to be specified on the
       command line.

       Note that the Linux kernel does not allow changing multiple
       propagation flags with a single <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> system call, and the
       flags cannot be mixed with other mount options and operations.

       Since util-linux 2.23 the <b>mount </b>command can be used to do more
       propagation (topology) changes by one <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> call and do it
       also together with other mount operations. The propagation flags
       are applied by additional <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> system calls when the
       preceding mount operations were successful. Note that this use
       case is not atomic. It is possible to specify the propagation
       flags in <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a> as mount options (<b>private</b>, <b>slave</b>, <b>shared</b>,
       <b>unbindable</b>, <b>rprivate</b>, <b>rslave</b>, <b>rshared</b>, <b>runbindable</b>).

       For example:

           mount --make-private --make-unbindable /dev/sda1 /foo

       is the same as:

           mount /dev/sda1 /foo
           mount --make-private /foo
           mount --make-unbindable /foo
</pre> <h2>
COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The full set of mount options used by an invocation of <b>mount </b>is
       determined by first extracting the mount options for the
       filesystem from the <i>fstab</i> table, then applying any options
       specified by the <b>-o </b>argument, and finally applying a <b>-r </b>or <b>-w</b>
       option, when present.

       The <b>mount </b>command does not pass all command-line options to the
       <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>suffix</i> mount helpers. The interface between <b>mount </b>and
       the mount helpers is described below in the <b>EXTERNAL HELPERS</b>
       section.

       Command-line options available for the <b>mount </b>command are:

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in <i>fstab</i>
           (except for those whose line contains the <b>noauto </b>keyword).
           The filesystems are mounted following their order in <i>fstab</i>.
           The <b>mount </b>command compares filesystem source, target (and fs
           root for bind mount or btrfs) to detect already mounted
           filesystems. The kernel table with already mounted
           filesystems is cached during <b>mount --all</b>. This means that all
           duplicated <i>fstab</i> entries will be mounted.

           The correct functionality depends on <i>/proc</i> (to detect already
           mounted filesystems) and on <i>/sys</i> (to evaluate filesystem tags
           like UUID= or LABEL=). It’s strongly recommended to mount
           <i>/proc</i> and <i>/sys</i> filesystems before <b>mount -a </b>is executed, or
           keep /proc and /sys at the beginning of <i>fstab</i>.

           The option <b>--all </b>is possible to use for remount operation
           too. In this case all filters (<b>-t </b>and <b>-O</b>) are applied to the
           table of already mounted filesystems.

           Since version 2.35 it is possible to use the command line
           option <b>-o </b>to alter mount options from <i>fstab</i> (see also
           <b>--options-mode</b>).

           Note that it is a bad practice to use <b>mount -a </b>for <i>fstab</i>
           checking. The recommended solution is <b>findmnt --verify</b>.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--bind</b>
           Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are
           available in both places). See above, under <b>Bind mount</b>
           <b>operation</b>.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--no-canonicalize</b>
           Don’t canonicalize paths. The <b>mount </b>command canonicalizes all
           paths (from the command line or <i>fstab</i>) by default. This
           option can be used together with the <b>-f </b>flag for already
           canonicalized absolute paths. The option is designed for
           mount helpers which call <b>mount -i</b>. It is strongly recommended
           to not use this command-line option for normal mount
           operations.

           Note that <b>mount </b>does not pass this option to the
           <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>type</i> helpers.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fork</b>
           (Used in conjunction with <b>-a</b>.) Fork off a new incarnation of
           <b>mount </b>for each device. This will do the mounts on different
           devices or different NFS servers in parallel. This has the
           advantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts proceed in
           parallel. A disadvantage is that the order of the mount
           operations is undefined. Thus, you cannot use this option if
           you want to mount both <i>/usr</i> and <i>/usr/spool</i>.

       <b>-f, --fake</b>
           Causes everything to be done except for the mount-related
           system calls. The <b>--fake </b>option was originally designed to
           write an entry to <i>/etc/mtab</i> without actually mounting.

           The <i>/etc/mtab</i> is no longer maintained in userspace, and
           starting from version 2.39, the mount operation can be a
           complex chain of operations with dependencies between the
           syscalls. The <b>--fake </b>option forces libmount to skip all mount
           source preparation, mount option analysis, and the actual
           mounting process.

           The difference between fake and non-fake execution is huge.
           This is the reason why the <b>--fake </b>option has minimal
           significance for the current <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> implementation and it
           is maintained mostly for backward compatibility.

       <b>-i, --internal-only</b>
           Don’t call the <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>filesystem</i> helper even if it
           exists.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--label </b><i>label</i>
           Mount the partition that has the specified <i>label</i>.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--show-labels</b>
           Add the labels in the mount output. <b>mount </b>must have
           permission to read the disk device (e.g. be set-user-ID root)
           for this to work. One can set such a label for ext2, ext3 or
           ext4 using the <a href="e2label.8.html">e2label(8)</a> utility, or for XFS using
           <a href="xfs_admin.8.html">xfs_admin(8)</a>, or for reiserfs using <b>reiserfstune</b>(8).

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--move</b>
           Move a subtree to some other place. See above, the subsection
           <b>The move operation</b>.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mkdir</b>[=<i>mode</i>]
           Allow to make a target directory (mountpoint) if it does not
           exist yet. Alias to "-o X-mount.mkdir[=mode]", the default
           mode is 0755. For more details see <b>X-mount.mkdir </b>below.

       <b>--map-groups</b>, <b>--map-users </b><i>inner</i>:_outer_:_count_
           Add the specified user/group mapping to an <b>X-mount.idmap </b>map.
           These options can be given multiple times to build up
           complete mappings for users and groups. For more details see
           <b>X-mount.idmap </b>below.

       <b>--map-users </b>/proc/<i>PID</i>/ns/user
           Use the specified user namespace for user and group mapping
           in an id-mapped mount. This is an alias for "-o
           X-mount.idmap=/proc/<i>PID</i>/ns/user" and cannot be used twice nor
           together with the <i>inner</i>:_outer_:_count_ option format above.
           For more details see <b>X-mount.idmap </b>below.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-mtab</b>
           Mount without writing in <i>/etc/mtab</i>. This is necessary for
           example when <i>/etc</i> is on a read-only filesystem.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--namespace </b><i>ns</i>
           Perform the mount operation in the mount namespace specified
           by <i>ns</i>. <i>ns</i> is either PID of process running in that namespace
           or special file representing that namespace.

           <b>mount </b>switches to the mount namespace when it reads
           <i>/etc/fstab</i>, writes <i>/etc/mtab: (or writes to _/run/mount</i>) and
           calls <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a>, otherwise it runs in the original mount
           namespace. This means that the target namespace does not have
           to contain any libraries or other requirements necessary to
           execute the <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> call.

           See <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a> for more information.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--test-opts </b><i>opts</i>
           Limit the set of filesystems to which the <b>-a </b>option applies.
           In this regard it is like the <b>-t </b>option except that <b>-O </b>is
           useless without <b>-a</b>. For example, the command

           <b>mount -a -O no_netdev</b>

           mounts all filesystems except those which have the option
           <i>netdev</i> specified in the options field in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file.

           It is different from <b>-t </b>in that each option is matched
           exactly; a leading <b>no </b>at the beginning of one option does not
           negate the rest.

           The <b>-t </b>and <b>-O </b>options are cumulative in effect; that is, the
           command

           <b>mount -a -t ext2 -O  _netdev</b>

           mounts all ext2 filesystems with the _netdev option, not all
           filesystems that are either ext2 or have the _netdev option
           specified.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--options </b><i>opts</i>
           Use the specified mount options. The <i>opts</i> argument is a
           comma-separated list. For example:

           <b>mount LABEL=mydisk -o noatime,nodev,nosuid</b>

           Note that the order of the options matters, as the last
           option wins if there are conflicting ones. The options from
           the command line also overwrite options from fstab by
           default.

           For more details, see the <b>FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT</b>
           <b>OPTIONS </b>and <b>FILESYSTEM-SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS </b>sections.

       <b>--onlyonce</b>
           Forces <b>mount </b>command to check if the filesystem is already
           mounted. This behavior is the default for <b>--all</b>; otherwise,
           it depends on the kernel filesystem driver. Some filesystems
           may be mounted more than once on the same mount point (e.g.
           tmpfs).

       <b>--options-mode </b><i>mode</i>
           Controls how to combine options from <i>fstab</i>/<i>mtab</i> with options
           from the command line. <i>mode</i> can be one of <b>ignore</b>, <b>append</b>,
           <b>prepend </b>or <b>replace</b>. For example, <b>append </b>means that options
           from <i>fstab</i> are appended to options from the command line. The
           default value is <b>prepend </b>— it means command line options are
           evaluated after <i>fstab</i> options. Note that the last option wins
           if there are conflicting ones.

       <b>--options-source </b><i>source</i>
           Source of default options. <i>source</i> is a comma-separated list
           of <b>fstab</b>, <b>mtab </b>and <b>disable</b>. <b>disable </b>disables <b>fstab </b>and <b>mtab</b>
           and enables <b>--options-source-force</b>. The default value is
           <b>fstab,mtab</b>.

       <b>--options-source-force</b>
           Use options from <i>fstab</i>/<i>mtab</i> even if both <i>device</i> and <i>dir</i> are
           specified.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--rbind</b>
           Remount a subtree and all possible submounts somewhere else
           (so that its contents are available in both places). See
           above, the subsection <b>Bind mount operation</b>.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--read-only</b>
           Mount the filesystem read-only. A synonym is <b>-o ro</b>.

           Note that, depending on the filesystem type, state and kernel
           behavior, the system may still write to the device. For
           example, ext3 and ext4 will replay the journal if the
           filesystem is dirty. To prevent this kind of write access,
           you may want to mount an ext3 or ext4 filesystem with the
           <b>ro,noload </b>mount options or set the block device itself to
           read-only mode, see the <a href="blockdev.8.html">blockdev(8)</a> command.

       <b>-s</b>
           Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than failing. This will
           ignore mount options not supported by a filesystem type. Not
           all filesystems support this option. Currently it’s supported
           by the <b>mount.nfs </b>mount helper only.

       <b>--source </b><i>device</i>
           If only one argument for the <b>mount </b>command is given, then the
           argument might be interpreted as the target (mountpoint) or
           source (device). This option allows you to explicitly define
           that the argument is the mount source.

       <b>--target </b><i>directory</i>
           If only one argument for the mount command is given, then the
           argument might be interpreted as the target (mountpoint) or
           source (device). This option allows you to explicitly define
           that the argument is the mount target.

       <b>--target-prefix </b><i>directory</i>
           Prepend the specified directory to all mount targets. This
           option can be used to follow <i>fstab</i>, but mount operations are
           done in another place, for example:

           <b>mount --all --target-prefix /chroot -o X-mount.mkdir</b>

           mounts all from system <i>fstab</i> to <i>/chroot</i>, all missing
           mountpoint are created (due to X-mount.mkdir). See also
           <b>--fstab </b>to use an alternative <i>fstab</i>.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--fstab </b><i>path</i>
           Specifies an alternative <i>fstab</i> file. If <i>path</i> is a directory,
           then the files in the directory are sorted by <a href="../man3/strverscmp.3.html">strverscmp(3)</a>;
           files that start with "." or without an <i>.fstab</i> extension are
           ignored. The option can be specified more than once. This
           option is mostly designed for initramfs or chroot scripts
           where additional configuration is specified beyond standard
           system configuration.

           Note that <b>mount </b>does not pass the option <b>--fstab </b>to the
           <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>type</i> helpers, meaning that the alternative <i>fstab</i>
           files will be invisible for the helpers. This is no problem
           for normal mounts, but user (non-root) mounts always require
           <i>fstab</i> to verify the user’s rights.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--types </b><i>fstype</i>
           The argument following the <b>-t </b>is used to indicate the
           filesystem type. The filesystem types which are currently
           supported depend on the running kernel. See <i>/proc/filesystems</i>
           and <i>/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs</i> for a complete list of
           the filesystems. The most common are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs,
           btrfs, vfat, sysfs, proc, nfs and cifs.

           The programs <b>mount </b>and <a href="umount.8.html">umount(8)</a> support filesystem subtypes.
           The subtype is defined by a '.subtype' suffix. For example
           'fuse.sshfs'. It’s recommended to use subtype notation rather
           than add any prefix to the mount source (for example
           'sshfs#example.com' is deprecated).

           If no <b>-t </b>option is given, or if the <b>auto </b>type is specified,
           <b>mount </b>will try to guess the desired type. <b>mount </b>uses the
           <a href="../man3/libblkid.3.html">libblkid(3)</a> library for guessing the filesystem type; if that
           does not turn up anything that looks familiar, <b>mount </b>will try
           to read the file <i>/etc/filesystems</i>, or, if that does not
           exist, <i>/proc/filesystems</i>. All of the filesystem types listed
           there will be tried, except for those that are labeled
           "nodev" (e.g. <i>devpts</i>, <i>proc</i> and <i>nfs</i>). If <i>/etc/filesystems</i> ends
           in a line with a single *, mount will read <i>/proc/filesystems</i>
           afterwards. While trying, all filesystem types will be
           mounted with the mount option <b>silent</b>.

           The <b>auto </b>type may be useful for user-mounted floppies.
           Creating a file <i>/etc/filesystems</i> can be useful to change the
           probe order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos or ext3 before
           ext2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader.

           More than one type may be specified in a comma-separated
           list, for the <b>-t </b>option as well as in an <i>/etc/fstab</i> entry.
           The list of filesystem types for the <b>-t </b>option can be
           prefixed with <b>no </b>to specify the filesystem types on which no
           action should be taken. The prefix <b>no </b>has no effect when
           specified in an <i>/etc/fstab</i> entry.

           The prefix <b>no </b>can be meaningful with the <b>-a </b>option. For
           example, the command

           <b>mount -a -t nomsdos,smbfs</b>

           mounts all filesystems except those of type <i>msdos</i> and <i>smbfs</i>.

           For most types all the <b>mount </b>program has to do is issue a
           simple <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> system call, and no detailed knowledge of the
           filesystem type is required. For a few types however (like
           nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) an ad hoc code is necessary.
           The nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems have a
           separate mount program. In order to make it possible to treat
           all types in a uniform way, <b>mount </b>will execute the program
           <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>type</i> (if that exists) when called with type <i>type</i>.
           Since different versions of the <b>smbmount </b>program have
           different calling conventions, <b>/sbin/mount.smbfs </b>may have to
           be a shell script that sets up the desired call.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--uuid </b><i>uuid</i>
           Mount the partition that has the specified <i>uuid</i>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Verbose mode.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--rw</b>, <b>--read-write</b>
           Mount the filesystem read/write. Read-write is the kernel
           default and the <b>mount </b>default is to try read-only if the
           previous <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> syscall with read-write flags on
           write-protected devices failed.

           A synonym is <b>-o rw</b>.

           Note that specifying <b>-w </b>on the command line forces <b>mount </b>to
           never try read-only mount on write-protected devices or
           already mounted read-only filesystems.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Some of these options are only useful when they appear in the
       <i>/etc/fstab</i> file.

       Some of these options could be enabled or disabled by default in
       the system kernel. To check the current setting see the options
       in <i>/proc/mounts</i>. Note that filesystems also have per-filesystem
       specific default mount options (see for example <b>tune2fs -l </b>output
       for ext<i>N</i> filesystems).

       The options <b>nosuid</b>, <b>noexec</b>, <b>nodiratime</b>, <b>relatime</b>, <b>noatime</b>,
       <b>strictatime</b>, and <b>nosymfollow </b>are interpreted only by the abstract
       VFS kernel layer and applied to the mountpoint node rather than
       to the filesystem itself. Try:

              findmnt -o TARGET,VFS-OPTIONS,FS-OPTIONS

       to get a complete overview of filesystems and VFS options.

       The read-only setting (<b>ro </b>or <b>rw</b>) is interpreted by VFS and the
       filesystem and depends on how the option is specified on the
       <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> command line. The default is to interpret it on the
       filesystem level. The operation "-o bind,remount,ro" is applied
       only to the VFS mountpoint, and operation "-o remount,ro" is
       applied to VFS and filesystem superblock. This semantic allows
       create a read-only mountpoint but keeps the filesystem writable
       from another mountpoint.

       Since v2.39 libmount can use a new kernel mount interface to set
       the VFS options recursive. For backward compatibility, this
       feature is not enabled by default, although recursive operation
       (e.g. rbind) has been requested. The new option argument
       "recursive" could be specified, for example:

              mount -orbind,ro=recursive,noexec=recursive,nosuid /foo /bar

       recursively binds filesystems from /foo to /bar, /bar, and all
       submounts will be read-only and noexec, but only /bar itself will
       be "nosuid". The "recursive" optional argument for VFS mount
       options is an EXPERIMENTAL feature.

       The following options apply to any filesystem that is being
       mounted (but not every filesystem actually honors them - e.g.,
       the <b>sync </b>option today has an effect only for ext2, ext3, ext4,
       fat, vfat, ufs and xfs):

       <b>async</b>
           All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously. (See
           also the <b>sync </b>option.)

       <b>atime</b>
           Do not use the <b>noatime </b>feature, so the inode access time is
           controlled by kernel defaults. See also the descriptions of
           the <b>relatime </b>and <b>strictatime </b>mount options.

       <b>noatime</b>
           Do not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g. for
           faster access on the news spool to speed up news servers).
           This works for all inode types (directories too), so it
           implies <b>nodiratime</b>.

       <b>auto</b>
           Can be mounted with the <b>-a </b>option.

       <b>noauto</b>
           Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the <b>-a </b>option will not
           cause the filesystem to be mounted).

       <b>context=</b><i>context</i>, <b>fscontext=</b><i>context</i>, <b>defcontext=</b><i>context</i>, and
       <b>rootcontext=</b><i>context</i>
           The <b>context= </b>option is useful when mounting filesystems that
           do not support extended attributes, such as a floppy or hard
           disk formatted with VFAT, or systems that are not normally
           running under SELinux, such as an ext3 or ext4 formatted disk
           from a non-SELinux workstation. You can also use <b>context= </b>on
           filesystems you do not trust, such as a floppy. It also helps
           in compatibility with xattr-supporting filesystems on earlier
           2.4.&lt;x&gt; kernel versions. Even where xattrs are supported, you
           can save time not having to label every file by assigning the
           entire disk one security context.

           A commonly used option for removable media is
           <b>context="system_u:object_r:removable_t</b>.

           The <b>fscontext= </b>option works for all filesystems, regardless
           of their xattr support. The fscontext option sets the
           overarching filesystem label to a specific security context.
           This filesystem label is separate from the individual labels
           on the files. It represents the entire filesystem for certain
           kinds of permission checks, such as during mount or file
           creation. Individual file labels are still obtained from the
           xattrs on the files themselves. The context option actually
           sets the aggregate context that fscontext provides, in
           addition to supplying the same label for individual files.

           You can set the default security context for unlabeled files
           using <b>defcontext= </b>option. This overrides the value set for
           unlabeled files in the policy and requires a filesystem that
           supports xattr labeling.

           The <b>rootcontext= </b>option allows you to explicitly label the
           root inode of a FS being mounted before that FS or inode
           becomes visible to userspace. This was found to be useful for
           things like stateless Linux. The special value <b>@target </b>can be
           used to assign the current context of the target mountpoint
           location.

           Note that the kernel rejects any remount request that
           includes the context option, <b>even </b>when unchanged from the
           current context.

           <b>Warning: the </b><i>context</i> <b>value might contain commas</b>, in which
           case the value has to be properly quoted, otherwise <b>mount</b>
           will interpret the comma as a separator between mount
           options. Don’t forget that the shell strips off quotes and
           thus <b>double quoting is required</b>. For example:

                  mount -t tmpfs none /mnt -o \
                  'context="system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0:c127,c456",noexec'

       For more details, see <a href="selinux.8.html">selinux(8)</a>.

       <b>defaults</b>
           Use the default options: <b>rw</b>, <b>suid</b>, <b>dev</b>, <b>exec</b>, <b>auto</b>, <b>nouser</b>,
           and <b>async</b>.

           Note that the real set of all default mount options depends
           on the kernel and filesystem type. See the beginning of this
           section for more details.

       <b>dev</b>
           Interpret character or block special devices on the
           filesystem.

       <b>nodev</b>
           Do not interpret character or block special devices on the
           filesystem.

       <b>diratime</b>
           Update directory inode access times on this filesystem. This
           is the default. (This option is ignored when <b>noatime </b>is set.)

       <b>nodiratime</b>
           Do not update directory inode access times on this
           filesystem. (This option is implied when <b>noatime </b>is set.)

       <b>dirsync</b>
           All directory updates within the filesystem should be done
           synchronously. This affects the following system calls:
           <a href="../man2/creat.2.html">creat(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/link.2.html">link(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/unlink.2.html">unlink(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/symlink.2.html">symlink(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/rmdir.2.html">rmdir(2)</a>,
           <a href="../man2/mknod.2.html">mknod(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename(2)</a>.

       <b>exec</b>
           Permit execution of binaries and other executable files.

       <b>noexec</b>
           Do not permit direct execution of any binaries on the mounted
           filesystem.

       <b>group</b>
           Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem if one of that
           user’s groups matches the group of the device. This option
           implies the options <b>nosuid </b>and <b>nodev </b>(unless overridden by
           subsequent options, as in the option line <b>group,dev,suid</b>).

       <b>iversion</b>
           Every time the inode is modified, the i_version field will be
           incremented.

       <b>noiversion</b>
           Do not increment the i_version inode field.

       <b>mand</b>
           Allow mandatory locks on this filesystem. See <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>. This
           option was deprecated in Linux 5.15.

       <b>nomand</b>
           Do not allow mandatory locks on this filesystem.

       <b>_netdev</b>
           The filesystem resides on a device that requires network
           access (used to prevent the system from attempting to mount
           these filesystems until the network has been enabled on the
           system).

       <b>nofail</b>
           Do not report errors for this device if it does not exist.

       <b>relatime</b>
           Update inode access times relative to modify or change time.
           Access time is only updated if the previous access time was
           earlier than or equal to the current modify or change time.
           (Similar to <b>noatime</b>, but it doesn’t break <b>mutt</b>(1) or other
           applications that need to know if a file has been read since
           the last time it was modified.)

           Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior
           provided by this option (unless <b>noatime </b>was specified), and
           the <b>strictatime </b>option is required to obtain traditional
           semantics. In addition, since Linux 2.6.30, the file’s last
           access time is always updated if it is more than 1 day old.

       <b>norelatime</b>
           Do not use the <b>relatime </b>feature. See also the <b>strictatime</b>
           mount option.

       <b>strictatime</b>
           Allows to explicitly request full atime updates. This makes
           it possible for the kernel to default to <b>relatime </b>or <b>noatime</b>
           but still allow userspace to override it. For more details
           about the default system mount options see <i>/proc/mounts</i>.

       <b>nostrictatime</b>
           Use the kernel’s default behavior for inode access time
           updates.

       <b>lazytime</b>
           Only update times (atime, mtime, ctime) on the in-memory
           version of the file inode.

           This mount option significantly reduces writes to the inode
           table for workloads that perform frequent random writes to
           preallocated files.

           The on-disk timestamps are updated only when:

           •   the inode needs to be updated for some change unrelated
               to file timestamps

           •   the application employs <a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/syncfs.2.html">syncfs(2)</a>, or <a href="../man2/sync.2.html">sync(2)</a>

           •   an undeleted inode is evicted from memory

           •   more than 24 hours have passed since the inode was
               written to disk.

       <b>nolazytime</b>
           Do not use the lazytime feature.

       <b>suid</b>
           Honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file capabilities
           when executing programs from this filesystem.

       <b>nosuid</b>
           Do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file
           capabilities when executing programs from this filesystem. In
           addition, SELinux domain transitions require permission
           <i>nosuid_transition</i>, which in turn needs also policy capability
           <i>nnp_nosuid_transition</i>.

       <b>silent</b>
           Turn on the silent flag.

       <b>loud</b>
           Turn off the silent flag.

       <b>owner</b>
           Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem if that user
           is the owner of the device. This option implies the options
           <b>nosuid </b>and <b>nodev </b>(unless overridden by subsequent options, as
           in the option line <b>owner,dev,suid</b>).

       <b>remount</b>
           Attempt to remount an already-mounted filesystem. This is
           commonly used to change the mount flags for a filesystem,
           especially to make a readonly filesystem writable. It does
           not change device or mount point.

           The remount operation together with the <b>bind </b>flag has special
           semantics. See above, the subsection <b>Bind mount operation</b>.

           The default kernel behavior for VFS mount flags
           (nodev,nosuid,noexec,ro) is to reset all unspecified flags on
           remount. That’s why <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> tries to keep the current
           setting according to <i>fstab</i> or <i>/proc/self/mountinfo</i>. This
           default behavior is possible to change by <b>--options-mode</b>. The
           recursive change of the mount flags (supported since v2.39 on
           systems with <a href="../man2/mount_setattr.2.html">mount_setattr(2)</a> syscall), for example, <b>mount -o</b>
           <b>remount,ro=recursive</b>, do not use "reset-unspecified"
           behavior, and it works as a simple add/remove operation and
           unspecified flags are not modified.

           The remount functionality follows the standard way the <b>mount</b>
           command works with options from <i>fstab</i>. This means that <b>mount</b>
           does not read <i>fstab</i> (or <i>mtab</i>) only when both <i>device</i> and <i>dir</i>
           are specified.

           <b>mount -o remount,rw /dev/foo /dir</b>

           After this call all old mount options are replaced and
           arbitrary stuff from <i>fstab</i> (or <i>mtab</i>) is ignored, except the
           <b>loop= </b>option which is internally generated and maintained by
           the <b>mount </b>command.

           <b>mount -o remount,rw /dir</b>

           After this call, <b>mount </b>reads <i>fstab</i> and merges these options
           with the options from the command line (<b>-o</b>). If no mountpoint
           is found in <i>fstab</i>, then it defaults to mount options from
           <i>/proc/self/mountinfo</i>.

           <b>mount </b>allows the use of <b>--all </b>to remount all already mounted
           filesystems which match a specified filter (<b>-O </b>and <b>-t</b>). For
           example:

           <b>mount --all -o remount,ro -t vfat</b>

           remounts all already mounted vfat filesystems in read-only
           mode. Each of the filesystems is remounted by <b>mount -o</b>
           <b>remount,ro </b><i>/dir</i> semantic. This means the <b>mount </b>command reads
           <i>fstab</i> or <i>mtab</i> and merges these options with the options from
           the command line.

       <b>ro</b>
           Mount the filesystem read-only.

       <b>rw</b>
           Mount the filesystem read-write.

       <b>sync</b>
           All I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously. In
           the case of media with a limited number of write cycles (e.g.
           some flash drives), <b>sync </b>may cause life-cycle shortening.

       <b>user</b>
           Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem. The name of
           the mounting user is written to the <i>mtab</i> file (or to the
           private libmount file in <i>/run/mount</i> on systems without a
           regular <i>mtab</i>) so that this same user can unmount the
           filesystem again. This option implies the options <b>noexec</b>,
           <b>nosuid</b>, and <b>nodev </b>(unless overridden by subsequent options,
           as in the option line <b>user,exec,dev,suid</b>).

       <b>nouser</b>
           Forbid an ordinary user to mount the filesystem. This is the
           default; it does not imply any other options.

       <b>users</b>
           Allow any user to mount and to unmount the filesystem, even
           when some other ordinary user mounted it. This option implies
           the options <b>noexec</b>, <b>nosuid</b>, and <b>nodev </b>(unless overridden by
           subsequent options, as in the option line
           <b>users,exec,dev,suid</b>).

       <b>X-</b>*
           All options prefixed with "X-" are interpreted as comments or
           as userspace application-specific options. These options are
           not stored in user space (e.g., <i>mtab</i> file), nor sent to the
           mount.<i>type</i> helpers nor to the <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> system call. The
           suggested format is <b>X-</b><i>appname</i>.<i>option</i>.

       <b>x-</b>*
           The same as <b>X-</b>* options, but stored permanently in user
           space. This means the options are also available for
           <a href="umount.8.html">umount(8)</a> or other operations. Note that maintaining mount
           options in user space is tricky, because it’s necessary use
           libmount-based tools and there is no guarantee that the
           options will be always available (for example after a move
           mount operation or in unshared namespace).

           Note that before util-linux v2.30 the x-* options have not
           been maintained by libmount and stored in user space
           (functionality was the same as for X-* now), but due to the
           growing number of use-cases (in initrd, systemd etc.) the
           functionality has been extended to keep existing <i>fstab</i>
           configurations usable without a change.

       <b>X-mount.auto-fstypes</b>=<i>list</i>
           Specifies allowed or forbidden filesystem types for automatic
           filesystem detection.

           The <i>list</i> is a comma-separated list of the filesystem names.
           The automatic filesystem detection is triggered by the "auto"
           filesystem type or when the filesystem type is not specified.

           The <i>list</i> follows how mount evaluates type patterns (see <b>-t</b>
           for more details). Only specified filesystem types are
           allowed, or all specified types are forbidden if the list is
           prefixed by "no".

           For example, X-mount.auto-fstypes="ext4,btrfs" accepts only
           ext4 and btrfs, and X-mount.auto-fstypes="novfat,xfs" accepts
           all filesystems except vfat and xfs.

           Note that comma is used as a separator between mount options,
           it means that auto-fstypes values have to be properly quoted,
           don’t forget that the shell strips off quotes and thus double
           quoting is required. For example:

          mount -t auto -o’X-mount.auto-fstypes="noext2,ext3"'
          /dev/sdc1 /mnt/test

       <b>X-mount.mkdir</b>[=<i>mode</i>]
           Allow to make a target directory (mountpoint) if it does not
           exist yet. The optional argument <i>mode</i> specifies the
           filesystem access mode used for <a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir(2)</a> in octal notation.
           The default mode is 0755. This functionality is supported
           only for root users or when <b>mount </b>is executed without suid
           permissions. The option is also supported as <b>x-mount.mkdir</b>,
           but this notation is deprecated since v2.30. See also <b>--mkdir</b>
           command line option.

       <b>X-mount.subdir=</b><i>directory</i>
           Allow mounting sub-directory from a filesystem instead of the
           root directory. For now, this feature is implemented by
           temporary filesystem root directory mount in unshared
           namespace and then bind the sub-directory to the final mount
           point and umount the root of the filesystem. The
           sub-directory mount shows up atomically for the rest of the
           system although it is implemented by multiple <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a>
           syscalls.

           Note that this feature will not work in session with an
           unshared private mount namespace (after <b>unshare --mount</b>) on
           old kernels or with <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> without support for
           file-descriptors-based mount kernel API. In this case, you
           need <b>unshare --mount --propagation shared</b>.

           This feature is EXPERIMENTAL.

       <b>X-mount.owner</b>=<i>username</i>|<i>UID</i>, <b>X-mount.group</b>=<i>group</i>|<i>GID</i>
           Set <i>mountpoint</i>'s ownership after mounting. Names resolved in
           the target mount namespace, see <b>-N</b>.

       <b>X-mount.mode</b>=<i>mode</i>
           Set <i>mountpoint</i>'s mode after mounting.

       <b>X-mount.idmap</b>=<i>id-type</i>:<i>id-mount</i>:<i>id-host</i>:<i>id-range</i>
       [<i>id-type</i>:<i>id-mount</i>:<i>id-host</i>:<i>id-range</i>], <b>X-mount.idmap</b>=<i>file</i>
           Use this option to create an idmapped mount. An idmapped
           mount allows to change ownership of all files located under a
           mount according to the ID-mapping associated with a user
           namespace. The ownership change is tied to the lifetime and
           localized to the relevant mount. The relevant ID-mapping can
           be specified in two ways:

           •   A user can specify the ID-mapping directly.

               The ID-mapping must be specified using the syntax
               <i>id-type</i>:<i>id-mount</i>:<i>id-host</i>:<i>id-range</i>. Specifying <b>u </b>as the
               <i>id-type</i> prefix creates a UID-mapping, <b>g </b>creates a
               GID-mapping and omitting <i>id-type</i> or specifying <b>b </b>creates
               both a UID- and GID-mapping. The <i>id-mount</i> parameter
               indicates the starting ID in the new mount. The <i>id-host</i>
               parameter indicates the starting ID in the filesystem.
               The <i>id-range</i> parameter indicates how many IDs are to be
               mapped. It is possible to specify multiple ID-mappings.
               The individual ID-mappings must be separated by spaces.

               For example, the ID-mapping <b>X-mount.idmap=u:1000:0:1</b>
               <b>g:1001:1:2 5000:1000:2 </b>creates an idmapped mount where
               UID 0 is mapped to UID 1000, GID 1 is mapped to GUID
               1001, GID 2 is mapped to GID 1002, UID and GID 1000 are
               mapped to 5000, and UID and GID 1001 are mapped to 5001
               in the mount.

               When an ID-mapping is specified directly a new user
               namespace will be allocated with the requested
               ID-mapping. The newly created user namespace will be
               attached to the mount.

           •   A user can specify a user namespace file.

               The user namespace will then be attached to the mount and
               the ID-mapping of the user namespace will become the
               ID-mapping of the mount.

               For example, <b>X-mount.idmap=/proc/PID/ns/user </b>will attach
               the user namespace of the process PID to the mount.

       <b>nosymfollow</b>
           Do not follow symlinks when resolving paths. Symlinks can
           still be created, and <a href="../man1/readlink.1.html">readlink(1)</a>, <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink(2)</a>, <a href="../man1/realpath.1.html">realpath(1)</a>,
           and <a href="../man3/realpath.3.html">realpath(3)</a> all still work properly.

       Note that some of the pages listed above might be available only
       after you install the respective userland tools.

       The following options apply only to certain filesystems. We sort
       them by filesystem. All options follow the <b>-o </b>flag.

       What options are supported depends a bit on the running kernel.
       Further information may be available in filesystem-specific files
       in the kernel source subdirectory <i>Documentation/filesystems</i>.

   <b>Mount options for adfs</b>
       <b>uid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>gid=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the owner and group of the files in the filesystem
           (default: uid=gid=0).

       <b>ownmask=</b><i>value</i> and <b>othmask=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the permission mask for ADFS 'owner' permissions and
           'other' permissions, respectively (default: 0700 and 0077,
           respectively). See also
           <i>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/adfs.rst</i>.

   <b>Mount options for affs</b>
       <b>uid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>gid=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the owner and group of the root of the filesystem
           (default: uid=gid=0, but with option <b>uid </b>or <b>gid </b>without
           specified value, the UID and GID of the current process are
           taken).

       <b>setuid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>setgid=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the owner and group of all files.

       <b>mode=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the mode of all files to <i>value</i> &amp; 0777 disregarding the
           original permissions. Add search permission to directories
           that have read permission. The value is given in octal.

       <b>protect</b>
           Do not allow any changes to the protection bits on the
           filesystem.

       <b>usemp</b>
           Set UID and GID of the root of the filesystem to the UID and
           GID of the mount point upon the first sync or umount, and
           then clear this option. Strange...

       <b>verbose</b>
           Print an informational message for each successful mount.

       <b>prefix=</b><i>string</i>
           Prefix used before volume name, when following a link.

       <b>volume=</b><i>string</i>
           Prefix (of length at most 30) used before '/' when following
           a symbolic link.

       <b>reserved=</b><i>value</i>
           (Default: 2.) Number of unused blocks at the start of the
           device.

       <b>root=</b><i>value</i>
           Give explicitly the location of the root block.

       <b>bs=</b><i>value</i>
           Give blocksize. Allowed values are 512, 1024, 2048, 4096.

       <b>grpquota</b>|<b>noquota</b>|<b>quota</b>|<b>usrquota</b>
           These options are accepted but ignored. (However, quota
           utilities may react to such strings in <i>/etc/fstab</i>.)

   <b>Mount options for debugfs</b>
       The debugfs filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally
       mounted on <i>/sys/kernel/debug</i>. As of kernel version 3.4, debugfs
       has the following options:

       <b>uid=</b><i>n</i><b>, gid=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the owner and group of the mountpoint.

       <b>mode=</b><i>value</i>
           Sets the mode of the mountpoint.

   <b>Mount options for devpts</b>
       The devpts filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally
       mounted on <i>/dev/pts</i>. In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a
       process opens <i>/dev/ptmx</i>; the number of the pseudo terminal is
       then made available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave
       can be accessed as <i>/dev/pts/</i>&lt;number&gt;.

       <b>uid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>gid=</b><i>value</i>
           This sets the owner or the group of newly created pseudo
           terminals to the specified values. When nothing is specified,
           they will be set to the UID and GID of the creating process.
           For example, if there is a tty group with GID 5, then <b>gid=5</b>
           will cause newly created pseudo terminals to belong to the
           tty group.

       <b>mode=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the mode of newly created pseudo terminals to the
           specified value. The default is 0600. A value of <b>mode=620 </b>and
           <b>gid=5 </b>makes "mesg y" the default on newly created pseudo
           terminals.

       <b>newinstance</b>
           Create a private instance of the devpts filesystem, such that
           indices of pseudo terminals allocated in this new instance
           are independent of indices created in other instances of
           devpts.

           All mounts of devpts without this <b>newinstance </b>option share
           the same set of pseudo terminal indices (i.e., legacy mode).
           Each mount of devpts with the <b>newinstance </b>option has a
           private set of pseudo terminal indices.

           This option is mainly used to support containers in the Linux
           kernel. It is implemented in Linux kernel versions starting
           with 2.6.29. Further, this mount option is valid only if
           <b>CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES </b>is enabled in the kernel
           configuration.

           To use this option effectively, <i>/dev/ptmx</i> must be a symbolic
           link to <i>pts/ptmx</i>. See <i>Documentation/filesystems/devpts.txt</i> in
           the Linux kernel source tree for details.

       <b>ptmxmode=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the mode for the new <i>ptmx</i> device node in the devpts
           filesystem.

           With the support for multiple instances of devpts (see
           <b>newinstance </b>option above), each instance has a private <i>ptmx</i>
           node in the root of the devpts filesystem (typically
           <i>/dev/pts/ptmx</i>).

           For compatibility with older versions of the kernel, the
           default mode of the new <i>ptmx</i> node is 0000. <b>ptmxmode=</b><i>value</i>
           specifies a more useful mode for the <i>ptmx</i> node and is highly
           recommended when the <b>newinstance </b>option is specified.

           This option is only implemented in Linux kernel versions
           starting with 2.6.29. Further, this option is valid only if
           <b>CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES </b>is enabled in the kernel
           configuration.

   <b>Mount options for fat</b>
       (Note: <i>fat</i> is not a separate filesystem, but a common part of the
       <i>msdos</i>, <i>umsdos</i> and <i>vfat</i> filesystems.)

       <b>blocksize=</b>{<b>512</b>|<b>1024</b>|<b>2048</b>}
           Set blocksize (default 512). This option is obsolete.

       <b>uid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>gid=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the owner and group of all files. (Default: the UID and
           GID of the current process.)

       <b>umask=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that are <b>not</b>
           present). The default is the umask of the current process.
           The value is given in octal.

       <b>dmask=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the umask applied to directories only. The default is the
           umask of the current process. The value is given in octal.

       <b>fmask=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the umask applied to regular files only. The default is
           the umask of the current process. The value is given in
           octal.

       <b>allow_utime=</b><i>value</i>
           This option controls the permission check of mtime/atime.

           <b>20</b>
               If current process is in group of file’s group ID, you
               can change timestamp.

           <b>2</b>
               Other users can change timestamp.

       The default is set from 'dmask' option. (If the directory is
       writable, <a href="../man2/utime.2.html">utime(2)</a> is also allowed. I.e. ~dmask &amp; 022)

       Normally <a href="../man2/utime.2.html">utime(2)</a> checks that the current process is owner of the
       file, or that it has the <b>CAP_FOWNER </b>capability. But FAT
       filesystems don’t have UID/GID on disk, so the normal check is
       too inflexible. With this option you can relax it.

       <b>check=</b><i>value</i>
           Three different levels of pickiness can be chosen:

           <b>r</b>[<b>elaxed</b>]
               Upper and lower case are accepted and equivalent, long
               name parts are truncated (e.g. <i>verylongname.foobar</i>
               becomes <i>verylong.foo</i>), leading and embedded spaces are
               accepted in each name part (name and extension).

           <b>n</b>[<b>ormal</b>]
               Like "relaxed", but many special characters (*, ?, &lt;,
               spaces, etc.) are rejected. This is the default.

           <b>s</b>[<b>trict</b>]
               Like "normal", but names that contain long parts or
               special characters that are sometimes used on Linux but
               are not accepted by MS-DOS (+, =, etc.) are rejected.

       <b>codepage=</b><i>value</i>
           Sets the codepage for converting to shortname characters on
           FAT and VFAT filesystems. By default, codepage 437 is used.

       <b>conv=</b><i>mode</i>
           This option is obsolete and may fail or be ignored.

       <b>cvf_format=</b><i>module</i>
           Forces the driver to use the CVF (Compressed Volume File)
           module cvf<i>_module</i> instead of auto-detection. If the kernel
           supports <b>kmod</b>, the <b>cvf_format=</b><i>xxx</i> option also controls
           on-demand CVF module loading. This option is obsolete.

       <b>cvf_option=</b><i>option</i>
           Option passed to the CVF module. This option is obsolete.

       <b>debug</b>
           Turn on the <i>debug</i> flag. A version string and a list of
           filesystem parameters will be printed (these data are also
           printed if the parameters appear to be inconsistent).

       <b>discard</b>
           If set, causes discard/TRIM commands to be issued to the
           block device when blocks are freed. This is useful for SSD
           devices and sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs.

       <b>dos1xfloppy</b>
           If set, use a fallback default BIOS Parameter Block
           configuration, determined by backing device size. These
           static parameters match defaults assumed by DOS 1.x for 160
           kiB, 180 kiB, 320 kiB, and 360 kiB floppies and floppy
           images.

       <b>errors=</b>{<b>panic</b>|<b>continue</b>|<b>remount-ro</b>}
           Specify FAT behavior on critical errors: panic, continue
           without doing anything, or remount the partition in read-only
           mode (default behavior).

       <b>fat=</b>{<b>12</b>|<b>16</b>|<b>32</b>}
           Specify a 12, 16 or 32 bit fat. This overrides the automatic
           FAT type detection routine. Use with caution!

       <b>iocharset=</b><i>value</i>
           Character set to use for converting between 8 bit characters
           and 16 bit Unicode characters. The default is iso8859-1. Long
           filenames are stored on disk in Unicode format.

       <b>nfs=</b>{<b>stale_rw</b>|<b>nostale_ro</b>}
           Enable this only if you want to export the FAT filesystem
           over NFS.

           <b>stale_rw</b>: This option maintains an index (cache) of directory
           inodes which is used by the nfs-related code to improve
           look-ups. Full file operations (read/write) over NFS are
           supported but with cache eviction at NFS server, this could
           result in spurious <b>ESTALE </b>errors.

           <b>nostale_ro</b>: This option bases the inode number and file
           handle on the on-disk location of a file in the FAT directory
           entry. This ensures that <b>ESTALE </b>will not be returned after a
           file is evicted from the inode cache. However, it means that
           operations such as rename, create and unlink could cause file
           handles that previously pointed at one file to point at a
           different file, potentially causing data corruption. For this
           reason, this option also mounts the filesystem readonly.

           To maintain backward compatibility, <b>-o nfs </b>is also accepted,
           defaulting to <b>stale_rw</b>.

       <b>tz=UTC</b>
           This option disables the conversion of timestamps between
           local time (as used by Windows on FAT) and UTC (which Linux
           uses internally). This is particularly useful when mounting
           devices (like digital cameras) that are set to UTC in order
           to avoid the pitfalls of local time.

       <b>time_offset=</b><i>minutes</i>
           Set offset for conversion of timestamps from local time used
           by FAT to UTC. I.e., <i>minutes</i> will be subtracted from each
           timestamp to convert it to UTC used internally by Linux. This
           is useful when the time zone set in the kernel via
           <a href="../man2/settimeofday.2.html">settimeofday(2)</a> is not the time zone used by the filesystem.
           Note that this option still does not provide correct time
           stamps in all cases in presence of DST - time stamps in a
           different DST setting will be off by one hour.

       <b>quiet</b>
           Turn on the <i>quiet</i> flag. Attempts to chown or chmod files do
           not return errors, although they fail. Use with caution!

       <b>rodir</b>
           FAT has the <b>ATTR_RO </b>(read-only) attribute. On Windows, the
           <b>ATTR_RO </b>of the directory will just be ignored, and is used
           only by applications as a flag (e.g. it’s set for the
           customized folder).

           If you want to use <b>ATTR_RO </b>as read-only flag even for the
           directory, set this option.

       <b>showexec</b>
           If set, the execute permission bits of the file will be
           allowed only if the extension part of the name is .EXE, .COM,
           or .BAT. Not set by default.

       <b>sys_immutable</b>
           If set, <b>ATTR_SYS </b>attribute on FAT is handled as <b>IMMUTABLE</b>
           flag on Linux. Not set by default.

       <b>flush</b>
           If set, the filesystem will try to flush to disk more early
           than normal. Not set by default.

       <b>usefree</b>
           Use the "free clusters" value stored on <b>FSINFO</b>. It’ll be used
           to determine number of free clusters without scanning disk.
           But it’s not used by default, because recent Windows don’t
           update it correctly in some case. If you are sure the "free
           clusters" on <b>FSINFO </b>is correct, by this option you can avoid
           scanning disk.

       <b>dots</b>, <b>nodots</b>, <b>dotsOK=</b>[<b>yes</b>|<b>no</b>]
           Various misguided attempts to force Unix or DOS conventions
           onto a FAT filesystem.

   <b>Mount options for hfs</b>
       <b>creator=</b><i>cccc</i><b>, type=</b><i>cccc</i>
           Set the creator/type values as shown by the MacOS finder used
           for creating new files. Default values: '????'.

       <b>uid=</b><i>n</i><b>, gid=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the owner and group of all files. (Default: the UID and
           GID of the current process.)

       <b>dir_umask=</b><i>n</i><b>, file_umask=</b><i>n</i><b>, umask=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the umask used for all directories, all regular files, or
           all files and directories. Defaults to the umask of the
           current process.

       <b>session=</b><i>n</i>
           Select the CDROM session to mount. Defaults to leaving that
           decision to the CDROM driver. This option will fail with
           anything but a CDROM as underlying device.

       <b>part=</b><i>n</i>
           Select partition number n from the device. Only makes sense
           for CDROMs. Defaults to not parsing the partition table at
           all.

       <b>quiet</b>
           Don’t complain about invalid mount options.

   <b>Mount options for hpfs</b>
       <b>uid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>gid=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the owner and group of all files. (Default: the UID and
           GID of the current process.)

       <b>umask=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that are <b>not</b>
           present). The default is the umask of the current process.
           The value is given in octal.

       <b>case=</b>{<b>lower</b>|<b>asis</b>}
           Convert all files names to lower case, or leave them.
           (Default: <b>case=lower</b>.)

       <b>conv=</b><i>mode</i>
           This option is obsolete and may fail or being ignored.

       <b>nocheck</b>
           Do not abort mounting when certain consistency checks fail.

   <b>Mount options for iso9660</b>
       ISO 9660 is a standard describing a filesystem structure to be
       used on CD-ROMs. (This filesystem type is also seen on some DVDs.
       See also the <i>udf</i> filesystem.)

       Normal <i>iso9660</i> filenames appear in an 8.3 format (i.e., DOS-like
       restrictions on filename length), and in addition all characters
       are in upper case. Also there is no field for file ownership,
       protection, number of links, provision for block/character
       devices, etc.

       Rock Ridge is an extension to iso9660 that provides all of these
       UNIX-like features. Basically there are extensions to each
       directory record that supply all of the additional information,
       and when Rock Ridge is in use, the filesystem is
       indistinguishable from a normal UNIX filesystem (except that it
       is read-only, of course).

       <b>norock</b>
           Disable the use of Rock Ridge extensions, even if available.
           Cf. <b>map</b>.

       <b>nojoliet</b>
           Disable the use of Microsoft Joliet extensions, even if
           available. Cf. <b>map</b>.

       <b>check=</b>{<b>r</b>[<b>elaxed</b>]|<b>s</b>[<b>trict</b>]}
           With <b>check=relaxed</b>, a filename is first converted to lower
           case before doing the lookup. This is probably only
           meaningful together with <b>norock </b>and <b>map=normal</b>. (Default:
           <b>check=strict</b>.)

       <b>uid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>gid=</b><i>value</i>
           Give all files in the filesystem the indicated user or group
           id, possibly overriding the information found in the Rock
           Ridge extensions. (Default: <b>uid=0,gid=0</b>.)

       <b>map=</b>{<b>n</b>[<b>ormal</b>]|<b>o</b>[<b>ff</b>]|<b>a</b>[<b>corn</b>]}
           For non-Rock Ridge volumes, normal name translation maps
           upper to lower case ASCII, drops a trailing ';1', and
           converts ';' to '.'. With <b>map=off </b>no name translation is
           done. See <b>norock</b>. (Default: <b>map=normal</b>.) <b>map=acorn </b>is like
           <b>map=normal </b>but also apply Acorn extensions if present.

       <b>mode=</b><i>value</i>
           For non-Rock Ridge volumes, give all files the indicated
           mode. (Default: read and execute permission for everybody.)
           Octal mode values require a leading 0.

       <b>unhide</b>
           Also show hidden and associated files. (If the ordinary files
           and the associated or hidden files have the same filenames,
           this may make the ordinary files inaccessible.)

       <b>block=</b>{<b>512</b>|<b>1024</b>|<b>2048</b>}
           Set the block size to the indicated value. (Default:
           <b>block=1024</b>.)

       <b>conv=</b><i>mode</i>
           This option is obsolete and may fail or being ignored.

       <b>cruft</b>
           If the high byte of the file length contains other garbage,
           set this mount option to ignore the high order bits of the
           file length. This implies that a file cannot be larger than
           16 MB.

       <b>session=</b><i>x</i>
           Select number of session on a multisession CD.

       <b>sbsector=</b><i>xxx</i>
           Session begins from sector xxx.

       The following options are the same as for vfat and specifying
       them only makes sense when using discs encoded using Microsoft’s
       Joliet extensions.

       <b>iocharset=</b><i>value</i>
           Character set to use for converting 16 bit Unicode characters
           on CD to 8 bit characters. The default is iso8859-1.

       <b>utf8</b>
           Convert 16 bit Unicode characters on CD to UTF-8.

   <b>Mount options for jfs</b>
       <b>iocharset=</b><i>name</i>
           Character set to use for converting from Unicode to ASCII.
           The default is to do no conversion. Use <b>iocharset=utf8 </b>for
           UTF8 translations. This requires <b>CONFIG_NLS_UTF8 </b>to be set in
           the kernel <i>.config</i> file.

       <b>resize=</b><i>value</i>
           Resize the volume to <i>value</i> blocks. JFS only supports growing
           a volume, not shrinking it. This option is only valid during
           a remount, when the volume is mounted read-write. The <b>resize</b>
           keyword with no value will grow the volume to the full size
           of the partition.

       <b>nointegrity</b>
           Do not write to the journal. The primary use of this option
           is to allow for higher performance when restoring a volume
           from backup media. The integrity of the volume is not
           guaranteed if the system abnormally ends.

       <b>integrity</b>
           Default. Commit metadata changes to the journal. Use this
           option to remount a volume where the <b>nointegrity </b>option was
           previously specified in order to restore normal behavior.

       <b>errors=</b>{<b>continue</b>|<b>remount-ro</b>|<b>panic</b>}
           Define the behavior when an error is encountered. (Either
           ignore errors and just mark the filesystem erroneous and
           continue, or remount the filesystem read-only, or panic and
           halt the system.)

       <b>noquota</b>|<b>quota</b>|<b>usrquota</b>|<b>grpquota</b>
           These options are accepted but ignored.

   <b>Mount options for msdos</b>
       See mount options for fat. If the <i>msdos</i> filesystem detects an
       inconsistency, it reports an error and sets the file system
       read-only. The filesystem can be made writable again by
       remounting it.

   <b>Mount options for ncpfs</b>
       Just like <i>nfs</i>, the <i>ncpfs</i> implementation expects a binary argument
       (a <i>struct ncp_mount_data</i>) to the <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> system call. This
       argument is constructed by <b>ncpmount</b>(8) and the current version of
       <b>mount </b>(2.12) does not know anything about ncpfs.

   <b>Mount options for ntfs</b>
       <b>iocharset=</b><i>name</i>
           Character set to use when returning file names. Unlike VFAT,
           NTFS suppresses names that contain nonconvertible characters.
           Deprecated.

       <b>nls=</b><i>name</i>
           New name for the option earlier called <i>iocharset</i>.

       <b>utf8</b>
           Use UTF-8 for converting file names.

       <b>uni_xlate=</b>{<b>0</b>|<b>1</b>|<b>2</b>}
           For 0 (or 'no' or 'false'), do not use escape sequences for
           unknown Unicode characters. For 1 (or 'yes' or 'true') or 2,
           use vfat-style 4-byte escape sequences starting with ":".
           Here 2 gives a little-endian encoding and 1 a byteswapped
           bigendian encoding.

       <b>posix=[0|1]</b>
           If enabled (posix=1), the filesystem distinguishes between
           upper and lower case. The 8.3 alias names are presented as
           hard links instead of being suppressed. This option is
           obsolete.

       <b>uid=</b><i>value</i>, <b>gid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>umask=</b><i>value</i>
           Set the file permission on the filesystem. The umask value is
           given in octal. By default, the files are owned by root and
           not readable by somebody else.

   <b>Mount options for overlay</b>
       Since Linux 3.18 the overlay pseudo filesystem implements a union
       mount for other filesystems.

       An overlay filesystem combines two filesystems - an <b>upper</b>
       filesystem and a <b>lower </b>filesystem. When a name exists in both
       filesystems, the object in the upper filesystem is visible while
       the object in the lower filesystem is either hidden or, in the
       case of directories, merged with the upper object.

       The lower filesystem can be any filesystem supported by Linux and
       does not need to be writable. The lower filesystem can even be
       another overlayfs. The upper filesystem will normally be writable
       and if it is it must support the creation of trusted.* extended
       attributes, and must provide a valid d_type in readdir responses,
       so NFS is not suitable.

       A read-only overlay of two read-only filesystems may use any
       filesystem type. The options <b>lowerdir </b>and <b>upperdir </b>are combined
       into a merged directory by using:

              mount -t overlay  overlay  \
                -olowerdir=/lower,upperdir=/upper,workdir=/work  /merged

       <b>lowerdir=</b><i>directory</i>
           Any filesystem, does not need to be on a writable filesystem.

       <b>upperdir=</b><i>directory</i>
           The upperdir is normally on a writable filesystem.

       <b>workdir=</b><i>directory</i>
           The workdir needs to be an empty directory on the same
           filesystem as upperdir.

       <b>userxattr</b>
           Use the "<b>user.overlay.</b>" xattr namespace instead of
           "<b>trusted.overlay.</b>". This is useful for unprivileged mounting
           of overlayfs.

       <b>redirect_dir=</b>{<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b>follow</b>|<b>nofollow</b>}
           If the <i>redirect_dir</i> feature is enabled, then the directory
           will be copied up (but not the contents). Then the
           "{<b>trusted</b>|<b>user</b>}.overlay.redirect" extended attribute is set
           to the path of the original location from the root of the
           overlay. Finally the directory is moved to the new location.

           <b>on</b>
               Redirects are enabled.

           <b>off</b>
               Redirects are not created and only followed if
               "redirect_always_follow" feature is enabled in the
               kernel/module config.

           <b>follow</b>
               Redirects are not created, but followed.

           <b>nofollow</b>
               Redirects are not created and not followed (equivalent to
               "redirect_dir=off" if "redirect_always_follow" feature is
               not enabled).

       <b>index=</b>{<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>}
           Inode index. If this feature is disabled and a file with
           multiple hard links is copied up, then this will "break" the
           link. Changes will not be propagated to other names referring
           to the same inode.

       <b>uuid=</b>{<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>}
           Can be used to replace UUID of the underlying filesystem in
           file handles with null, and effectively disable UUID checks.
           This can be useful in case the underlying disk is copied and
           the UUID of this copy is changed. This is only applicable if
           all lower/upper/work directories are on the same filesystem,
           otherwise it will fallback to normal behaviour.

       <b>nfs_export=</b>{<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>}
           When the underlying filesystems supports NFS export and the
           "nfs_export" feature is enabled, an overlay filesystem may be
           exported to NFS.

           With the "nfs_export" feature, on copy_up of any lower
           object, an index entry is created under the index directory.
           The index entry name is the hexadecimal representation of the
           copy up origin file handle. For a non-directory object, the
           index entry is a hard link to the upper inode. For a
           directory object, the index entry has an extended attribute
           "{<b>trusted</b>|<b>user</b>}.overlay.upper" with an encoded file handle of
           the upper directory inode.

           When encoding a file handle from an overlay filesystem
           object, the following rules apply

               •   For a non-upper object, encode a lower file handle
                   from lower inode

               •   For an indexed object, encode a lower file handle
                   from copy_up origin

               •   For a pure-upper object and for an existing
                   non-indexed upper object, encode an upper file handle
                   from upper inode

           The encoded overlay file handle includes

               •   Header including path type information (e.g.
                   lower/upper)

               •   UUID of the underlying filesystem

               •   Underlying filesystem encoding of underlying inode

           This encoding format is identical to the encoding format of
           file handles that are stored in extended attribute
           "{<b>trusted</b>|<b>user</b>}.overlay.origin". When decoding an overlay
           file handle, the following steps are followed

               •   Find underlying layer by UUID and path type
                   information.

               •   Decode the underlying filesystem file handle to
                   underlying dentry.

               •   For a lower file handle, lookup the handle in index
                   directory by name.

               •   If a whiteout is found in index, return <b>ESTALE</b>. This
                   represents an overlay object that was deleted after
                   its file handle was encoded.

               •   For a non-directory, instantiate a disconnected
                   overlay dentry from the decoded underlying dentry,
                   the path type and index inode, if found.

               •   For a directory, use the connected underlying decoded
                   dentry, path type and index, to lookup a connected
                   overlay dentry.

           Decoding a non-directory file handle may return a
           disconnected dentry. copy_up of that disconnected dentry will
           create an upper index entry with no upper alias.

           When overlay filesystem has multiple lower layers, a middle
           layer directory may have a "redirect" to lower directory.
           Because middle layer "redirects" are not indexed, a lower
           file handle that was encoded from the "redirect" origin
           directory, cannot be used to find the middle or upper layer
           directory. Similarly, a lower file handle that was encoded
           from a descendant of the "redirect" origin directory, cannot
           be used to reconstruct a connected overlay path. To mitigate
           the cases of directories that cannot be decoded from a lower
           file handle, these directories are copied up on encode and
           encoded as an upper file handle. On an overlay filesystem
           with no upper layer this mitigation cannot be used NFS export
           in this setup requires turning off redirect follow (e.g.
           "<i>redirect_dir=nofollow</i>").

           The overlay filesystem does not support non-directory
           connectable file handles, so exporting with the <i>subtree_check</i>
           exportfs configuration will cause failures to lookup files
           over NFS.

           When the NFS export feature is enabled, all directory index
           entries are verified on mount time to check that upper file
           handles are not stale. This verification may cause
           significant overhead in some cases.

           Note: the mount options <i>index=off,nfs_export=on</i> are
           conflicting for a read-write mount and will result in an
           error.

       <b>xino=</b>{<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b>auto</b>}
           The "xino" feature composes a unique object identifier from
           the real object st_ino and an underlying fsid index. The
           "xino" feature uses the high inode number bits for fsid,
           because the underlying filesystems rarely use the high inode
           number bits. In case the underlying inode number does
           overflow into the high xino bits, overlay filesystem will
           fall back to the non xino behavior for that inode.

           For a detailed description of the effect of this option
           please refer to
           <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html">https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html</a>

       <b>metacopy=</b>{<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>}
           When metadata only copy up feature is enabled, overlayfs will
           only copy up metadata (as opposed to whole file), when a
           metadata specific operation like chown/chmod is performed.
           Full file will be copied up later when file is opened for
           WRITE operation.

           In other words, this is delayed data copy up operation and
           data is copied up when there is a need to actually modify
           data.

       <b>volatile</b>
           Volatile mounts are not guaranteed to survive a crash. It is
           strongly recommended that volatile mounts are only used if
           data written to the overlay can be recreated without
           significant effort.

           The advantage of mounting with the "volatile" option is that
           all forms of sync calls to the upper filesystem are omitted.

           In order to avoid a giving a false sense of safety, the
           syncfs (and fsync) semantics of volatile mounts are slightly
           different than that of the rest of VFS. If any writeback
           error occurs on the upperdir’s filesystem after a volatile
           mount takes place, all sync functions will return an error.
           Once this condition is reached, the filesystem will not
           recover, and every subsequent sync call will return an error,
           even if the upperdir has not experience a new error since the
           last sync call.

           When overlay is mounted with "volatile" option, the directory
           "$workdir/work/incompat/volatile" is created. During next
           mount, overlay checks for this directory and refuses to mount
           if present. This is a strong indicator that user should throw
           away upper and work directories and create fresh one. In very
           limited cases where the user knows that the system has not
           crashed and contents of upperdir are intact, The "volatile"
           directory can be removed.

   <b>Mount options for reiserfs</b>
       Reiserfs is a journaling filesystem.

       <b>conv</b>
           Instructs version 3.6 reiserfs software to mount a version
           3.5 filesystem, using the 3.6 format for newly created
           objects. This filesystem will no longer be compatible with
           reiserfs 3.5 tools.

       <b>hash=</b>{<b>rupasov</b>|<b>tea</b>|<b>r5</b>|<b>detect</b>}
           Choose which hash function reiserfs will use to find files
           within directories.

           <b>rupasov</b>
               A hash invented by Yury Yu. Rupasov. It is fast and
               preserves locality, mapping lexicographically close file
               names to close hash values. This option should not be
               used, as it causes a high probability of hash collisions.

           <b>tea</b>
               A Davis-Meyer function implemented by Jeremy
               Fitzhardinge. It uses hash permuting bits in the name. It
               gets high randomness and, therefore, low probability of
               hash collisions at some CPU cost. This may be used if
               <b>EHASHCOLLISION </b>errors are experienced with the r5 hash.

           <b>r5</b>
               A modified version of the rupasov hash. It is used by
               default and is the best choice unless the filesystem has
               huge directories and unusual file-name patterns.

           <b>detect</b>
               Instructs <b>mount </b>to detect which hash function is in use
               by examining the filesystem being mounted, and to write
               this information into the reiserfs superblock. This is
               only useful on the first mount of an old format
               filesystem.

       <b>hashed_relocation</b>
           Tunes the block allocator. This may provide performance
           improvements in some situations.

       <b>no_unhashed_relocation</b>
           Tunes the block allocator. This may provide performance
           improvements in some situations.

       <b>noborder</b>
           Disable the border allocator algorithm invented by Yury Yu.
           Rupasov. This may provide performance improvements in some
           situations.

       <b>nolog</b>
           Disable journaling. This will provide slight performance
           improvements in some situations at the cost of losing
           reiserfs’s fast recovery from crashes. Even with this option
           turned on, reiserfs still performs all journaling operations,
           save for actual writes into its journaling area.
           Implementation of <i>nolog</i> is a work in progress.

       <b>notail</b>
           By default, reiserfs stores small files and 'file tails'
           directly into its tree. This confuses some utilities such as
           <b>lilo</b>(8). This option is used to disable packing of files into
           the tree.

       <b>replayonly</b>
           Replay the transactions which are in the journal, but do not
           actually mount the filesystem. Mainly used by <i>reiserfsck</i>.

       <b>resize=</b><i>number</i>
           A remount option which permits online expansion of reiserfs
           partitions. Instructs reiserfs to assume that the device has
           <i>number</i> blocks. This option is designed for use with devices
           which are under logical volume management (LVM). There is a
           special <i>resizer</i> utility which can be obtained from
           ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfsprogs.

       <b>user_xattr</b>
           Enable Extended User Attributes. See the <a href="../man1/attr.1.html">attr(1)</a> manual page.

       <b>acl</b>
           Enable POSIX Access Control Lists. See the <a href="../man5/acl.5.html">acl(5)</a> manual
           page.

       <b>barrier=none </b>/ <b>barrier=flush</b>
           This disables / enables the use of write barriers in the
           journaling code. <b>barrier=none </b>disables, <b>barrier=flush </b>enables
           (default). This also requires an IO stack which can support
           barriers, and if reiserfs gets an error on a barrier write,
           it will disable barriers again with a warning. Write barriers
           enforce proper on-disk ordering of journal commits, making
           volatile disk write caches safe to use, at some performance
           penalty. If your disks are battery-backed in one way or
           another, disabling barriers may safely improve performance.

   <b>Mount options for ubifs</b>
       UBIFS is a flash filesystem which works on top of UBI volumes.
       Note that <b>atime </b>is not supported and is always turned off.

       The device name may be specified as

          <b>ubiX_Y</b>
              UBI device number <b>X</b>, volume number <b>Y</b>

          <b>ubiY</b>
              UBI device number <b>0</b>, volume number <b>Y</b>

          <b>ubiX:NAME</b>
              UBI device number <b>X</b>, volume with name <b>NAME</b>

          <b>ubi:NAME</b>
              UBI device number <b>0</b>, volume with name <b>NAME</b>

       Alternative <b>! </b>separator may be used instead of <b>:</b>.

       The following mount options are available:

       <b>bulk_read</b>
           Enable bulk-read. VFS read-ahead is disabled because it slows
           down the filesystem. Bulk-Read is an internal optimization.
           Some flashes may read faster if the data are read at one go,
           rather than at several read requests. For example, OneNAND
           can do "read-while-load" if it reads more than one NAND page.

       <b>no_bulk_read</b>
           Do not bulk-read. This is the default.

       <b>chk_data_crc</b>
           Check data CRC-32 checksums. This is the default.

       <b>no_chk_data_crc</b>
           Do not check data CRC-32 checksums. With this option, the
           filesystem does not check CRC-32 checksum for data, but it
           does check it for the internal indexing information. This
           option only affects reading, not writing. CRC-32 is always
           calculated when writing the data.

       <b>compr=</b>{<b>none</b>|<b>lzo</b>|<b>zlib</b>}
           Select the default compressor which is used when new files
           are written. It is still possible to read compressed files if
           mounted with the <b>none </b>option.

   <b>Mount options for udf</b>
       UDF is the "Universal Disk Format" filesystem defined by OSTA,
       the Optical Storage Technology Association, and is often used for
       DVD-ROM, frequently in the form of a hybrid UDF/ISO-9660
       filesystem. It is, however, perfectly usable by itself on disk
       drives, flash drives and other block devices. See also <i>iso9660</i>.

       <b>uid=</b>
           Make all files in the filesystem belong to the given user.
           uid=forget can be specified independently of (or usually in
           addition to) uid=&lt;user&gt; and results in UDF not storing uids
           to the media. In fact the recorded uid is the 32-bit overflow
           uid -1 as defined by the UDF standard. The value is given as
           either &lt;user&gt; which is a valid user name or the corresponding
           decimal user id, or the special string "forget".

       <b>gid=</b>
           Make all files in the filesystem belong to the given group.
           gid=forget can be specified independently of (or usually in
           addition to) gid=&lt;group&gt; and results in UDF not storing gids
           to the media. In fact the recorded gid is the 32-bit overflow
           gid -1 as defined by the UDF standard. The value is given as
           either &lt;group&gt; which is a valid group name or the
           corresponding decimal group id, or the special string
           "forget".

       <b>umask=</b>
           Mask out the given permissions from all inodes read from the
           filesystem. The value is given in octal.

       <b>mode=</b>
           If <b>mode= </b>is set the permissions of all non-directory inodes
           read from the filesystem will be set to the given mode. The
           value is given in octal.

       <b>dmode=</b>
           If <b>dmode= </b>is set the permissions of all directory inodes read
           from the filesystem will be set to the given dmode. The value
           is given in octal.

       <b>bs=</b>
           Set the block size. Default value prior to kernel version
           2.6.30 was 2048. Since 2.6.30 and prior to 4.11 it was
           logical device block size with fallback to 2048. Since 4.11
           it is logical block size with fallback to any valid block
           size between logical device block size and 4096.

   <b>Mount options for ufs</b>
       <b>ufstype=</b><i>value</i>
           UFS is a filesystem widely used in different operating
           systems. The problem are differences among implementations.
           Features of some implementations are undocumented, so its
           hard to recognize the type of ufs automatically. That’s why
           the user must specify the type of ufs by mount option.
           Possible values are:

           <b>old</b>
               Old format of ufs, this is the default, read only. (Don’t
               forget to give the <b>-r </b>option.)

           <b>44bsd</b>
               For filesystems created by a BSD-like system (NetBSD,
               FreeBSD, OpenBSD).

           <b>ufs2</b>
               Used in FreeBSD 5.x supported as read-write.

           <b>5xbsd</b>
               Synonym for ufs2.

           <b>sun</b>
               For filesystems created by SunOS or Solaris on Sparc.

           <b>sunx86</b>
               For filesystems created by Solaris on x86.

           <b>hp</b>
               For filesystems created by HP-UX, read-only.

           <b>nextstep</b>
               For filesystems created by NeXTStep (on NeXT station)
               (currently read only).

           <b>nextstep-cd</b>
               For NextStep CDROMs (block_size == 2048), read-only.

           <b>openstep</b>
               For filesystems created by OpenStep (currently read
               only). The same filesystem type is also used by macOS.

       <b>onerror=</b><i>value</i>
           Set behavior on error:

           <b>panic</b>
               If an error is encountered, cause a kernel panic.

           [<b>lock</b>|<b>umount</b>|<b>repair</b>]
               These mount options don’t do anything at present; when an
               error is encountered only a console message is printed.

   <b>Mount options for umsdos</b>
       See mount options for msdos. The <b>dotsOK </b>option is explicitly
       killed by <i>umsdos</i>.

   <b>Mount options for vfat</b>
       First of all, the mount options for <i>fat</i> are recognized. The
       <b>dotsOK </b>option is explicitly killed by <i>vfat</i>. Furthermore, there
       are

       <b>uni_xlate</b>
           Translate unhandled Unicode characters to special escaped
           sequences. This lets you backup and restore filenames that
           are created with any Unicode characters. Without this option,
           a '?' is used when no translation is possible. The escape
           character is ':' because it is otherwise invalid on the vfat
           filesystem. The escape sequence that gets used, where u is
           the Unicode character, is: ':', (u &amp; 0x3f), ((u&gt;&gt;6) &amp; 0x3f),
           (u&gt;&gt;12).

       <b>posix</b>
           Allow two files with names that only differ in case. This
           option is obsolete.

       <b>nonumtail</b>
           First try to make a short name without sequence number,
           before trying <i>name~num.ext</i>.

       <b>utf8</b>
           UTF8 is the filesystem safe 8-bit encoding of Unicode that is
           used by the console. It can be enabled for the filesystem
           with this option or disabled with utf8=0, utf8=no or
           utf8=false. If <i>uni_xlate</i> gets set, UTF8 gets disabled.

       <b>shortname=</b><i>mode</i>
           Defines the behavior for creation and display of filenames
           which fit into 8.3 characters. If a long name for a file
           exists, it will always be the preferred one for display.
           There are four <i>mode</i>s:

           <b>lower</b>
               Force the short name to lower case upon display; store a
               long name when the short name is not all upper case.

           <b>win95</b>
               Force the short name to upper case upon display; store a
               long name when the short name is not all upper case.

           <b>winnt</b>
               Display the short name as is; store a long name when the
               short name is not all lower case or all upper case.

           <b>mixed</b>
               Display the short name as is; store a long name when the
               short name is not all upper case. This mode is the
               default since Linux 2.6.32.

   <b>Mount options for usbfs</b>
       <b>devuid=</b><i>uid</i> and <b>devgid=</b><i>gid</i> and <b>devmode=</b><i>mode</i>
           Set the owner and group and mode of the device files in the
           usbfs filesystem (default: uid=gid=0, mode=0644). The mode is
           given in octal.

       <b>busuid=</b><i>uid</i> and <b>busgid=</b><i>gid</i> and <b>busmode=</b><i>mode</i>
           Set the owner and group and mode of the bus directories in
           the usbfs filesystem (default: uid=gid=0, mode=0555). The
           mode is given in octal.

       <b>listuid=</b><i>uid</i> and <b>listgid=</b><i>gid</i> and <b>listmode=</b><i>mode</i>
           Set the owner and group and mode of the file <i>devices</i>
           (default: uid=gid=0, mode=0444). The mode is given in octal.
</pre> <h2>
DM-VERITY SUPPORT </h2>
<pre>
       The device-mapper verity target provides read-only transparent
       integrity checking of block devices using kernel crypto API. The
       <b>mount </b>command can open the dm-verity device and do the integrity
       verification before the device filesystem is mounted. Requires
       libcryptsetup with in libmount (optionally via <a href="../man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen(3)</a>). If
       libcryptsetup supports extracting the root hash of an already
       mounted device, existing devices will be automatically reused in
       case of a match. Mount options for dm-verity:

       <b>verity.hashdevice=</b><i>path</i>
           Path to the hash tree device associated with the source
           volume to pass to dm-verity.

       <b>verity.roothash=</b><i>hex</i>
           Hex-encoded hash of the root of <i>verity.hashdevice</i>. Mutually
           exclusive with <i>verity.roothashfile.</i>

       <b>verity.roothashfile=</b><i>path</i>
           Path to file containing the hex-encoded hash of the root of
           <i>verity.hashdevice.</i> Mutually exclusive with <i>verity.roothash.</i>

       <b>verity.hashoffset=</b><i>offset</i>
           If the hash tree device is embedded in the source volume,
           <i>offset</i> (default: 0) is used by dm-verity to get to the tree.

       <b>verity.fecdevice=</b><i>path</i>
           Path to the Forward Error Correction (FEC) device associated
           with the source volume to pass to dm-verity. Optional.
           Requires kernel built with <b>CONFIG_DM_VERITY_FEC</b>.

       <b>verity.fecoffset=</b><i>offset</i>
           If the FEC device is embedded in the source volume, <i>offset</i>
           (default: 0) is used by dm-verity to get to the FEC area.
           Optional.

       <b>verity.fecroots=</b><i>value</i>
           Parity bytes for FEC (default: 2). Optional.

       <b>verity.roothashsig=</b><i>path</i>
           Path to <b>pkcs7</b>(1ssl) signature of root hash hex string.
           Requires crypt_activate_by_signed_key() from cryptsetup and
           kernel built with <b>CONFIG_DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG</b>. For
           device reuse, signatures have to be either used by all mounts
           of a device or by none. Optional.

       <b>verity.oncorruption=</b><i>ignore</i>|<i>restart</i>|<i>panic</i>
           Instruct the kernel to ignore, reboot or panic when
           corruption is detected. By default the I/O operation simply
           fails. Requires Linux 4.1 or newer, and libcrypsetup 2.3.4 or
           newer. Optional.

       Supported since util-linux v2.35.

       For example commands:

           mksquashfs /etc /tmp/etc.raw
           veritysetup format /tmp/etc.raw /tmp/etc.verity --root-hash-file=/tmp/etc.roothash
           openssl smime -sign -in /tmp/etc.roothash -nocerts -inkey private.key \
           -signer private.crt -noattr -binary -outform der -out /tmp/etc.roothash.p7s
           mount -o verity.hashdevice=/tmp/etc.verity,verity.roothashfile=/tmp/etc.roothash,\
           verity.roothashsig=/tmp/etc.roothash.p7s /tmp/etc.raw /mnt

       create squashfs image from <i>/etc</i> directory, verity hash device and
       mount verified filesystem image to <i>/mnt</i>. The kernel will verify
       that the root hash is signed by a key from the kernel keyring if
       roothashsig is used.
</pre> <h2>
LOOP-DEVICE SUPPORT </h2>
<pre>
       One further possible type is a mount via the loop device. For
       example, the command

          <b>mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -t vfat -o loop=/dev/loop3</b>

       will set up the loop device <i>/dev/loop3</i> to correspond to the file
       <i>/tmp/disk.img</i>, and then mount this device on <i>/mnt</i>.

       If no explicit loop device is mentioned (but just an option '<b>-o</b>
       <b>loop</b>' is given), then <b>mount </b>will try to find some unused loop
       device and use that, for example

          <b>mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -o loop</b>

       The <b>mount </b>command <b>automatically </b>creates a loop device from a
       regular file if a filesystem type is not specified or the
       filesystem is known for libblkid, for example:

          <b>mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt</b>

          <b>mount -t ext4 /tmp/disk.img /mnt</b>

       This type of mount knows about three options, namely <b>loop</b>, <b>offset</b>
       and <b>sizelimit</b>, that are really options to <a href="losetup.8.html">losetup(8)</a>. (These
       options can be used in addition to those specific to the
       filesystem type.)

       Since Linux 2.6.25 auto-destruction of loop devices is supported,
       meaning that any loop device allocated by <b>mount </b>will be freed by
       <b>umount </b>independently of <i>/etc/mtab</i>.

       You can also free a loop device by hand, using <b>losetup -d </b>or
       <b>umount -d</b>.

       Since util-linux v2.29, <b>mount </b>re-uses the loop device rather than
       initializing a new device if the same backing file is already
       used for some loop device with the same offset and sizelimit.
       This is necessary to avoid a filesystem corruption.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mount </b>has the following exit status values (the bits can be
       ORed):

       <b>0</b>
           success

       <b>1</b>
           incorrect invocation or permissions

       <b>2</b>
           system error (out of memory, cannot fork, no more loop
           devices)

       <b>4</b>
           internal <b>mount </b>bug

       <b>8</b>
           user interrupt

       <b>16</b>
           problems writing or locking <i>/etc/mtab</i>

       <b>32</b>
           mount failure

       <b>64</b>
           some mount succeeded

           The command <b>mount -a </b>returns 0 (all succeeded), 32 (all
           failed), or 64 (some failed, some succeeded).

       <b>126</b>
           failed to execute external /sbin/mount.&lt;type&gt; mount helper
           (since util-linux v2.41)
</pre> <h2>
EXTERNAL HELPERS </h2>
<pre>
       The syntax of external mount helpers is:

       <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>suffix spec dir</i> [<b>-sfnv</b>] [<b>-N </b><i>namespace</i>] [<b>-o </b><i>options</i>]
       [<b>-t </b><i>type</i><b>.</b><i>subtype</i>]

       where the <i>suffix</i> is the filesystem type and the <b>-sfnvoN </b>options
       have the same meaning as the normal mount options. The <b>-t </b>option
       is used for filesystems with subtypes support (for example
       <b>/sbin/mount.fuse -t fuse.sshfs</b>).

       The command <b>mount </b>does not pass the mount options <b>unbindable</b>,
       <b>runbindable</b>, <b>private</b>, <b>rprivate</b>, <b>slave</b>, <b>rslave</b>, <b>shared</b>, <b>rshared</b>,
       <b>auto</b>, <b>noauto</b>, <b>comment</b>, <b>x-</b>*, <b>loop</b>, <b>offset </b>and <b>sizelimit </b>to the
       mount.&lt;suffix&gt; helpers. All other options are used in a
       comma-separated list as an argument to the <b>-o </b>option.

       The exit status value of the helper is returned as the exit
       status of <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>. The value 126 is sed if the mount helper
       program is found, but the execl() failed.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       A <b>mount </b>command existed in Version 5 AT&amp;T UNIX.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       It is possible for a corrupted filesystem to cause a crash.

       Some Linux filesystems don’t support <b>-o sync </b>and <b>-o dirsync </b>(the
       ext2, ext3, ext4, fat and vfat filesystems <i>do</i> support synchronous
       updates (a la BSD) when mounted with the <b>sync </b>option).

       The <b>-o remount </b>may not be able to change mount parameters (all
       <i>ext2fs</i>-specific parameters, except <b>sb</b>, are changeable with a
       remount, for example, but you can’t change <b>gid </b>or <b>umask </b>for the
       <i>fatfs</i>).

       It is possible that the files <i>/etc/mtab</i> and <i>/proc/mounts</i> don’t
       match on systems with a regular <i>mtab</i> file. The first file is
       based only on the <b>mount </b>command options, but the content of the
       second file also depends on the kernel and others settings (e.g.
       on a remote NFS server — in certain cases the <b>mount </b>command may
       report unreliable information about an NFS mount point and the
       <i>/proc/mount</i> file usually contains more reliable information.)
       This is another reason to replace the <i>mtab</i> file with a symlink to
       the <i>/proc/mounts</i> file.

       Checking files on NFS filesystems referenced by file descriptors
       (i.e. the <b>fcntl </b>and <b>ioctl </b>families of functions) may lead to
       inconsistent results due to the lack of a consistency check in
       the kernel even if the <b>noac </b>mount option is used.

       The <b>loop </b>option with the <b>offset </b>or <b>sizelimit </b>options used may
       fail when using older kernels if the <b>mount </b>command can’t confirm
       that the size of the block device has been configured as
       requested. This situation can be worked around by using the
       <a href="losetup.8.html">losetup(8)</a> command manually before calling <b>mount </b>with the
       configured loop device.
