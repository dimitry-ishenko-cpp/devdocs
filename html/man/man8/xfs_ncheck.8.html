NAME </h2>
<pre>
       xfs_ncheck - generate pathnames from i-numbers for XFS
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_ncheck </b>[ <b>-i </b><i>ino</i> ] ... [ <b>-f </b>] [ <b>-s </b>] [ <b>-l </b><i>logdev</i> ] <i>device</i>
       <b>xfs_ncheck -V</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xfs_ncheck </b>with no <b>-i </b>arguments generates an inode number and
       pathname list of all files on the given filesystem. Names of
       directory files are followed by <b>/.</b>.  The output is not sorted in
       any particular order.  The filesystem to be examined is specified
       by the <i>device</i> argument, which should be the disk or volume device
       for the filesystem.  Filesystems stored in files can also be
       checked, using the <b>-f </b>flag.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-f       </b>Specifies that the filesystem image to be processed is
                stored in a regular file at <i>device</i> (see the <b>mkfs.xfs -d</b>
                <i>file</i> option). This might happen if an image copy of a
                filesystem has been made into an ordinary file.

       <b>-l </b><i>logdev</i>
                Specifies the device where the filesystem's external log
                resides.  Only for those filesystems which use an
                external log. See the <b>mkfs.xfs -l </b>option, and refer to
                <a href="../man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a> for a detailed description of the XFS log.

       <b>-s       </b>Limits the report to special files and files with
                setuserid mode.  This option may be used to detect
                violations of security policy.

       <b>-i </b><i>ino</i>   Limits the report to only those files whose inode
                numbers follow.  May be given multiple times to select
                multiple inode numbers.

       <b>-V       </b>Prints the version number and exits.

       If the filesystem is seriously corrupted, or very busy and looks
       like it is corrupt, a message of the form that would be generated
       by the <a href="xfs_db.8.html">xfs_db(8)</a> "check" command may appear.

       <b>xfs_ncheck </b>is only useful with XFS filesystems.
