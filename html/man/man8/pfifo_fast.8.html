</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pfifo_fast - three-band first in, first out queue
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       pfifo_fast is the default qdisc of each interface.

       Whenever an interface is created, the pfifo_fast qdisc is
       automatically used as a queue. If another qdisc is attached, it
       preempts the default pfifo_fast, which automatically returns to
       function when an existing qdisc is detached.

       In this sense this qdisc is magic, and unlike other qdiscs.
</pre> <h2>
ALGORITHM </h2>
<pre>
       The algorithm is very similar to that of the classful <a href="tc-prio.8.html">tc-prio(8)</a>
       qdisc.  <b>pfifo_fast </b>is like three <a href="tc-pfifo.8.html">tc-pfifo(8)</a> queues side by side,
       where packets can be enqueued in any of the three bands based on
       their Type of Service bits or assigned priority.

       Not all three bands are dequeued simultaneously - as long as
       lower bands have traffic, higher bands are never dequeued. This
       can be used to prioritize interactive traffic or penalize 'lowest
       cost' traffic.

       Each band can be txqueuelen packets long, as configured with
       <a href="ip.8.html">ip(8)</a>.  Additional packets coming in are not enqueued but are
       instead dropped.

       See <a href="tc-prio.8.html">tc-prio(8)</a> for complete details on how TOS bits are
       translated into bands.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
       txqueuelen
              The length of the three bands depends on the interface
              txqueuelen, as specified with <a href="ip.8.html">ip(8)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Does not maintain statistics and does not show up in tc qdisc ls.
       This is because it is the automatic default in the absence of a
       configured qdisc.
