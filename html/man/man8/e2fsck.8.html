</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>e2fsck </b>is used to check the ext2/ext3/ext4 family of file
       systems.  For ext3 and ext4 file systems that use a journal, if
       the system has been shut down uncleanly without any errors,
       normally, after replaying the committed transactions in the
       journal, the file system should be marked as clean.  Hence, for
       file systems that use journaling, <b>e2fsck </b>will normally replay the
       journal and exit, unless its superblock indicates that further
       checking is required.

       <i>device</i> is a block device (e.g., <i>/dev/sdc1</i>) or file containing the
       file system.

       Note that in general it is not safe to run <b>e2fsck </b>on mounted file
       systems.  The only exception is if the <b>-n </b>option is specified,
       and <b>-c</b>, <b>-l</b>, or <b>-L </b>options are <i>not</i> specified.  However, even if it
       is safe to do so, the results printed by <b>e2fsck </b>are not valid if
       the file system is mounted.  If <b>e2fsck </b>asks whether or not you
       should check a file system which is mounted, the only correct
       answer is ``no''.  Only experts who really know what they are
       doing should consider answering this question in any other way.

       If <b>e2fsck </b>is run in interactive mode (meaning that none of <b>-y</b>,
       <b>-n</b>, or <b>-p </b>are specified), the program will ask the user to fix
       each problem found in the file system.  A response of 'y' will
       fix the error; 'n' will leave the error unfixed; and 'a' will fix
       the problem and all subsequent problems; pressing Enter will
       proceed with the default response, which is printed before the
       question mark.  Pressing Control-C terminates e2fsck immediately.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a     </b>This option does the same thing as the <b>-p </b>option.  It is
              provided for backwards compatibility only; it is suggested
              that people use <b>-p </b>option whenever possible.

       <b>-b </b><i>superblock</i>
              Instead of using the normal superblock, use an alternative
              superblock specified by <i>superblock</i>.  This option is
              normally used when the primary superblock has been
              corrupted.  The location of backup superblocks is
              dependent on the file system's blocksize, the number of
              blocks per group, and features such as <b>sparse_super</b>.

              Additional backup superblocks can be determined by using
              the <b>mke2fs </b>program using the <b>-n </b>option to print out where
              the superblocks exist, supposing <b>mke2fs </b>is supplied with
              arguments that are consistent with the file system's
              layout (e.g. blocksize, blocks per group, <b>sparse_super</b>,
              etc.).

              If an alternative superblock is specified and the file
              system is not opened read-only, e2fsck will make sure that
              the primary superblock is updated appropriately upon
              completion of the file system check.

       <b>-B </b><i>blocksize</i>
              Normally, <b>e2fsck </b>will search for the superblock at various
              different block sizes in an attempt to find the
              appropriate block size.  This search can be fooled in some
              cases.  This option forces <b>e2fsck </b>to only try locating the
              superblock at a particular blocksize.  If the superblock
              is not found, <b>e2fsck </b>will terminate with a fatal error.

       <b>-c     </b>This option causes <b>e2fsck </b>to use <a href="badblocks.8.html">badblocks(8)</a> program to
              do a read-only scan of the device in order to find any bad
              blocks.  If any bad blocks are found, they are added to
              the bad block inode to prevent them from being allocated
              to a file or directory.  If this option is specified
              twice, then the bad block scan will be done using a non-
              destructive read-write test.

       <b>-C </b><i>fd</i>  This option causes <b>e2fsck </b>to write completion information
              to the specified file descriptor so that the progress of
              the file system check can be monitored.  This option is
              typically used by programs which are running <b>e2fsck</b>.  If
              the file descriptor number is negative, then absolute
              value of the file descriptor will be used, and the
              progress information will be suppressed initially.  It can
              later be enabled by sending the <b>e2fsck </b>process a SIGUSR1
              signal.  If the file descriptor specified is 0, <b>e2fsck</b>
              will print a completion bar as it goes about its business.
              This requires that e2fsck is running on a video console or
              terminal.

       <b>-d     </b>Print debugging output (useless unless you are debugging
              <b>e2fsck</b>).

       <b>-D     </b>Optimize directories in file system.  This option causes
              e2fsck to try to optimize all directories, either by re-
              indexing them if the file system supports directory
              indexing, or by sorting and compressing directories for
              smaller directories, or for file systems using traditional
              linear directories.

              Even without the <b>-D </b>option, <b>e2fsck </b>may sometimes optimize
              a few directories --- for example, if directory indexing
              is enabled and a directory is not indexed and would
              benefit from being indexed, or if the index structures are
              corrupted and need to be rebuilt.  The <b>-D </b>option forces
              all directories in the file system to be optimized.  This
              can sometimes make them a little smaller and slightly
              faster to search, but in practice, you should rarely need
              to use this option.

              The <b>-D </b>option will detect directory entries with duplicate
              names in a single directory, which e2fsck normally does
              not enforce for performance reasons.

       <b>-E </b><i>extended_options</i>
              Set e2fsck extended options.  Extended options are comma
              separated, and may take an argument using the equals ('=')
              sign.  The following options are supported:

                   <b>ea_ver=</b><i>extended_attribute_version</i>
                          Set the version of the extended attribute
                          blocks which <b>e2fsck </b>will require while
                          checking the file system.  The version number
                          may be 1 or 2.  The default extended attribute
                          version format is 2.

                   <b>journal_only</b>
                          Only replay the journal if required, but do
                          not perform any further checks or repairs.

                   <b>fragcheck</b>
                          During pass 1, print a detailed report of any
                          discontiguous blocks for files in the file
                          system.

                   <b>discard</b>
                          Attempt to discard free blocks and unused
                          inode blocks after the full file system check
                          (discarding blocks is useful on solid state
                          devices and sparse / thin-provisioned
                          storage).  Note that discard is done in pass 5
                          AFTER the file system has been fully checked
                          and only if it does not contain recognizable
                          errors.  However there might be cases where
                          <b>e2fsck </b>does not fully recognize a problem and
                          hence in this case this option may prevent you
                          from further manual data recovery.

                   <b>nodiscard</b>
                          Do not attempt to discard free blocks and
                          unused inode blocks.  This option is exactly
                          the opposite of discard option.  This is set
                          as default.

                   <b>no_optimize_extents</b>
                          Do not offer to optimize the extent tree by
                          eliminating unnecessary width or depth.  This
                          can also be enabled in the options section of
                          <b>/etc/e2fsck.conf</b>.

                   <b>optimize_extents</b>
                          Offer to optimize the extent tree by
                          eliminating unnecessary width or depth.  This
                          is the default unless otherwise specified in
                          <b>/etc/e2fsck.conf</b>.

                   <b>inode_count_fullmap</b>
                          Trade off using memory for speed when checking
                          a file system with a large number of hard-
                          linked files.  The amount of memory required
                          is proportional to the number of inodes in the
                          file system.  For large file systems, this can
                          be gigabytes of memory.  (For example, a 40 TB
                          file system with 2.8 billion inodes will
                          consume an additional 5.7 GB memory if this
                          optimization is enabled.)  This optimization
                          can also be enabled in the options section of
                          <b>/etc/e2fsck.conf</b>.

                   <b>no_inode_count_fullmap</b>
                          Disable the <b>inode_count_fullmap </b>optimization.
                          This is the default unless otherwise specified
                          in <b>/etc/e2fsck.conf</b>.

                   <b>readahead_kb</b>
                          Use this many KiB of memory to pre-fetch
                          metadata in the hopes of reducing e2fsck
                          runtime.  By default, this is set to the size
                          of two block groups' inode tables (typically
                          4 MiB on a regular ext4 file system); if this
                          amount is more than 1/50th of total physical
                          memory, readahead is disabled.  Set this to
                          zero to disable readahead entirely.

                   <b>bmap2extent</b>
                          Convert block-mapped files to extent-mapped
                          files.

                   <b>fixes_only</b>
                          Only fix damaged metadata; do not optimize
                          htree directories or compress extent trees.
                          This option is incompatible with the -D and -E
                          bmap2extent options.

                   <b>check_encoding</b>
                          Force verification of encoded filenames in
                          case-insensitive directories.  This is the
                          default mode if the file system has the strict
                          flag enabled.

                   <b>unshare_blocks</b>
                          If the file system has shared blocks, with the
                          shared blocks read-only feature enabled, then
                          this will unshare all shared blocks and unset
                          the read-only feature bit.  If there is not
                          enough free space then the operation will
                          fail.  If the file system does not have the
                          read-only feature bit, but has shared blocks
                          anyway, then this option will have no effect.
                          Note when using this option, if there is no
                          free space to clone blocks, there is no prompt
                          to delete files and instead the operation will
                          fail.

                          Note that unshare_blocks implies the "-f"
                          option to ensure that all passes are run.
                          Additionally, if "-n" is also specified,
                          e2fsck will simulate trying to allocate enough
                          space to deduplicate.  If this fails, the exit
                          code will be non-zero.

       <b>-f     </b>Force checking even if the file system seems clean.

       <b>-F     </b>Flush the file system device's buffer caches before
              beginning.  Only really useful for doing <b>e2fsck </b>time
              trials.

       <b>-j </b><i>external-journal</i>
              Set the pathname where the external-journal for this file
              system can be found.

       <b>-k     </b>When combined with the <b>-c </b>option, any existing bad blocks
              in the bad blocks list are preserved, and any new bad
              blocks found by running <a href="badblocks.8.html">badblocks(8)</a> will be added to the
              existing bad blocks list.

       <b>-l </b><i>filename</i>
              Add the block numbers listed in the file specified by
              <i>filename</i> to the list of bad blocks.  The format of this
              file is the same as the one generated by the <a href="badblocks.8.html">badblocks(8)</a>
              program.  Note that the block numbers are based on the
              blocksize of the file system.  Hence, <a href="badblocks.8.html">badblocks(8)</a> must be
              given the blocksize of the file system in order to obtain
              correct results.  As a result, it is much simpler and
              safer to use the <b>-c </b>option to <b>e2fsck</b>, since it will assure
              that the correct parameters are passed to the <b>badblocks</b>
              program.

       <b>-L </b><i>filename</i>
              Set the bad blocks list to be the list of blocks specified
              by <i>filename</i>.  (This option is the same as the <b>-l </b>option,
              except the bad blocks list is cleared before the blocks
              listed in the file are added to the bad blocks list.)

       <b>-n     </b>Open the file system read-only, and assume an answer of
              `no' to all questions.  Allows <b>e2fsck </b>to be used non-
              interactively.  This option may not be specified at the
              same time as the <b>-p </b>or <b>-y </b>options.

       <b>-p     </b>Automatically repair ("preen") the file system.  This
              option will cause <b>e2fsck </b>to automatically fix any file
              system problems that can be safely fixed without human
              intervention.  If <b>e2fsck </b>discovers a problem which may
              require the system administrator to take additional
              corrective action, <b>e2fsck </b>will print a description of the
              problem and then exit with the value 4 logically or'ed
              into the exit code.  (See the <b>EXIT CODE </b>section.)  This
              option is normally used by the system's boot scripts.  It
              may not be specified at the same time as the <b>-n </b>or <b>-y</b>
              options.

       <b>-r     </b>This option does nothing at all; it is provided only for
              backwards compatibility.

       <b>-t     </b>Print timing statistics for <b>e2fsck</b>.  If this option is
              used twice, additional timing statistics are printed on a
              pass by pass basis.

       <b>-v     </b>Verbose mode.

       <b>-V     </b>Print version information and exit.

       <b>-y     </b>Assume an answer of `yes' to all questions; allows <b>e2fsck</b>
              to be used non-interactively.  This option may not be
              specified at the same time as the <b>-n </b>or <b>-p </b>options.

       <b>-z </b><i>undo_file</i>
              Before overwriting a file system block, write the old
              contents of the block to an undo file.  This undo file can
              be used with <a href="e2undo.8.html">e2undo(8)</a> to restore the old contents of the
              file system should something go wrong.  If the empty
              string is passed as the undo_file argument, the undo file
              will be written to a file named e2fsck-<i>device</i>.e2undo in
              the directory specified via the <i>E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR</i>
              environment variable.

              WARNING: The undo file cannot be used to recover from a
              power or system crash.

SIGNALS </h2>
<pre>
       The following signals have the following effect when sent to
       <b>e2fsck</b>.

       <b>SIGUSR1</b>
              This signal causes <b>e2fsck </b>to start displaying a completion
              bar or emitting progress information.  (See discussion of
              the <b>-C </b>option.)

       <b>SIGUSR2</b>
              This signal causes <b>e2fsck </b>to stop displaying a completion
              bar or emitting progress information.
</pre> <h2>
REPORTING BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Almost any piece of software will have bugs.  If you manage to
       find a file system which causes <b>e2fsck </b>to crash, or which <b>e2fsck</b>
       is unable to repair, please report it to the author.

       Please include as much information as possible in your bug
       report.  Ideally, include a complete transcript of the <b>e2fsck</b>
       run, so I can see exactly what error messages are displayed.
       (Make sure the messages printed by <b>e2fsck </b>are in English; if your
       system has been configured so that <b>e2fsck</b>'s messages have been
       translated into another language, please set the <b>LC_ALL</b>
       environment variable to <b>C </b>so that the transcript of e2fsck's
       output will be useful to me.)  If you have a writable file system
       where the transcript can be stored, the <a href="../man1/script.1.html">script(1)</a> program is a
       handy way to save the output of <b>e2fsck </b>to a file.

       It is also useful to send the output of <a href="dumpe2fs.8.html">dumpe2fs(8)</a>.  If a
       specific inode or inodes seems to be giving <b>e2fsck </b>trouble, try
       running the <a href="debugfs.8.html">debugfs(8)</a> command and send the output of the
       <b>stat</b>(1u) command run on the relevant inode(s).  If the inode is a
       directory, the <b>debugfs </b><i>dump</i> command will allow you to extract the
       contents of the directory inode, which can sent to me after being
       first run through <b>uuencode</b>(1).  The most useful data you can send
       to help reproduce the bug is a compressed raw image dump of the
       file system, generated using <a href="e2image.8.html">e2image(8)</a>.  See the <a href="e2image.8.html">e2image(8)</a> man
       page for more details.

       Always include the full version string which <b>e2fsck </b>displays when
       it is run, so I know which version you are running.
