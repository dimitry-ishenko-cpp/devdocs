Name </h2>
<pre>
       groff_tmac - macro files in the GNU <i>roff</i> typesetting system
</pre> <h2>
Description </h2>
<pre>
       Definitions of macros, strings, and registers for use in a
       <i>roff</i>(7) document can be collected into <i>macro files</i>, <i>roff</i> input
       files designed to produce no output themselves but instead ease
       the preparation of other <i>roff</i> documents.  There is no syntactical
       difference between a macro file and any other <i>roff</i> document; only
       its purpose distinguishes it.  When a macro file is installed at
       a standard location, named according to a certain convention, and
       suitable for use by a general audience, it is termed a <i>macro</i>
       <i>package</i>.  The “tmac” name originated in early Unix culture as an
       abbreviation of “<i>troff</i> macros”.

       Macro packages can be loaded by supplying the <b>-m </b>option to
       <i>troff</i>(1) or a <i>groff</i> front end.  A macro file's name must have the
       form name<i>.tmac</i> (or <i>tmac.</i>name) and be placed in a “<i>tmac</i> directory”
       to be loadable with the “<b>-m </b><i>name</i>” option.  Section “Environment”
       of <i>troff</i>(1) lists these directories.  Alternatively, a <i>groff</i>
       document requiring a macro file can load it with the <b>mso </b>(“macro
       source”) request.

       Macro files are named for their most noteworthy application, but
       a macro file need not define any macros.  It can restrict itself
       to defining registers and strings or invoking other <i>groff</i>
       requests.  It can even be empty.

       Encode macro files in ISO 646 (“ASCII”) or either of CCSID (“code
       page”) 1047 (on EBCDIC systems) or ISO Latin-1 (8859-1)
       (otherwise).  <i>soelim</i>(1) by design does not interpret <b>mso</b>
       requests, and the encodings used by documents employing a macro
       file can vary.

Macro packages </h2>
<pre>
       Macro packages come in two varieties; those that assume
       responsibility for page layout and other critical functions
       (“major” or “full-service”) and those that do not (“supplemental”
       or “auxiliary”).  GNU <i>roff</i> provides most major macro packages
       found in AT&amp;T and BSD Unix systems, an additional full-service
       package, and many supplemental packages.  Multiple full-service
       macro packages cannot be used by the same document.  Auxiliary
       packages can, in general, be freely combined, though attention to
       their use of the <i>groff</i> language name spaces for identifiers
       (particularly registers, macros, strings, and diversions) should
       be paid.  Name space management was a significant challenge in
       AT&amp;T <i>troff</i>; <i>groff</i>'s support for arbitrarily long identifiers
       affords few excuses for name collisions, apart from attempts at
       compatibility with the demands of historical documents.

   <b>Man pages</b>
       Two full-service macro packages are specialized for formatting
       Unix reference manuals; they do not support features like
       footnotes or multiple columnation.

       <i>an</i>     constructs man pages in a format introduced by Seventh
              Edition Unix (1979).  Its macro interface is small, and
              the package widely used; see <i>groff_man</i>(7).

       <i>doc</i>    constructs man pages in a format introduced by 4.3BSD-Reno
              (1990).  It provides many more features than <i>an</i>, but is
              also larger, more complex, and not as widely adopted; see
              <i>groff_mdoc</i>(7).

       Because readers of man pages often do not know in advance which
       macros are used to format a given document, a wrapper is
       available.

       <i>andoc</i>  recognizes a document's use of <i>an</i> or <i>doc</i> and loads the
              corresponding macro package.  Multiple man pages, in
              either format, can be handled; <i>andoc</i> reloads each macro
              package as necessary.

   <b>Full-service packages</b>
       The following packages each support composition of documents of
       any kind, from single-page memos to lengthy monographs.  They are
       similar in functionality; select one that suits your taste.

       <i>me</i>     originates in 2BSD (1978); see <i>groff_me</i>(7).

       <i>mm</i>     originates in Programmer's Workbench (PWB) Unix 1.0
              (1977); see <i>groff_mm</i>(7).

       <i>mom</i>    was contributed to <i>groff</i> in 2002, and freely exercises its
              many extended features.  See <i>groff_mom</i>(7).

       <i>ms</i>     originates in Sixth Edition Unix (1975); see <i>groff_ms</i>(7).

   <b>Localization packages</b>
       For Western languages, the localization file sets the hyphenation
       mode and loads hyphenation patterns and exceptions.  Localization
       files can also adjust the date format and provide translations of
       strings used by some of the full-service macro packages; alter
       the input encoding (see the next section); and change the amount
       of additional inter-sentence space.  For Eastern languages, the
       localization file defines character classes and sets flags on
       them.  By default, <i>troffrc</i> loads the localization file for
       English.

       <i>trans</i>  loads localized strings used by various macro packages
              after their localized forms have been prepared by a
              localization macro file.

       <i>groff</i> provides the following localization files.

       <i>cs</i>     Czech; localizes <i>man</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>mm</i>, <i>mom</i>, and <i>ms</i>.  Sets the input
              encoding to Latin-2 by loading <i>latin2.tmac</i>.

       <i>de</i>
       <i>den</i>    German; localizes <i>man</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>mm</i>, <i>mom</i>, and <i>ms</i>.  Sets the
              input encoding to Latin-1 by loading <i>latin1.tmac</i>.

              <i>de.tmac</i> selects hyphenation patterns for traditional
              orthography, and <i>den.tmac</i> does the same for the new
              orthography (“Rechtschreibreform”).

       <i>en</i>     English.

       <i>es</i>     Spanish; localizes <i>man</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>mm</i>, <i>mom</i>, and <i>ms</i>.  Sets the
              input encoding to Latin-9 by loading <i>latin9.tmac</i>.

       <i>fr</i>     French; localizes <i>man</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>mm</i>, <i>mom</i>, and <i>ms</i>.  Sets the
              input encoding to Latin-9 by loading <i>latin9.tmac</i>.

       <i>it</i>     Italian; localizes <i>man</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>mm</i>, <i>mom</i>, and <i>ms</i>.

       <i>ja</i>     Japanese.

       <i>ru</i>     Russian; localizes <i>man</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>mm</i>, <i>mom</i>, and <i>ms</i>.  Sets the
              input encoding to KOI8-R by loading <i>koi8-r.tmac</i>.

       <i>sv</i>     Swedish; localizes <i>man</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>mm</i>, <i>mom</i>, and <i>ms</i>.  Sets the
              input encoding to Latin-1 by loading <i>latin1.tmac</i>.  Some of
              the localization of the <i>mm</i> package is handled separately;
              see <i>groff_mmse</i>(7).

       <i>zh</i>     Chinese.

   <b>Input encodings</b>
       A document that requires one of the following encodings can load
       a corresponding macro file.

       <i>latin1</i>
       <i>latin2</i>
       <i>latin5</i>
       <i>latin9</i> support the ISO 8859 Latin-1, Latin-2, Latin-5, and
              Latin-9 encodings

       <i>cp1047</i> supports EBCDIC-based systems using CCSID 1047.

       <i>koi8-r</i> supports the KOI8-R encoding.  KOI8-R code points in the
              range 0x80–0x9F are not valid input on systems using ISO
              character codings natively; see section “Identifiers” in
              <i>groff</i>(7).  This should be no impediment to practical
              documents, as these KOI8-R code points do not encode
              letters, but box-drawing symbols and characters that are
              better obtained via special character escape sequences;
              see <i>groff_char</i>(7).

       Because different input character codes constitute valid GNU
       <i>troff</i> input on ISO and EBCDIC systems, the <i>latin</i> and <i>koi8-r</i> macro
       files cannot be used on EBCDIC systems, and <i>cp1047</i> cannot be used
       on ISO systems.

   <b>Auxiliary packages</b>
       The macro packages in this section are not intended for stand-
       alone use, but can add functionality to any other macro package
       or to plain (“raw”) <i>groff</i> documents.

       <i>62bit</i>  provides macros for addition, multiplication, and division
              of 62-bit integers (allowing safe multiplication of signed
              31-bit integers, for example).

       <i>hdtbl</i>  allows the generation of tables using a syntax similar to
              the HTML table model.  This Heidelberger table macro
              package is not a preprocessor, which can be useful if the
              contents of table entries are determined by macro calls or
              string interpolations.  Compare to <i>tbl</i>(1).  It works only
              with the <b>ps </b>and <b>pdf </b>output devices.  See <i>groff_hdtbl</i>(7).

       <i>papersize</i>
              enables the paper format to be set on the command line
              with the “<b>-d paper=</b><i>fmt</i>” option to <i>troff</i>.  Valid <i>fmt</i>s are
              the ISO and DIN formats “<b>A0</b>–<b>A6</b>”, “<b>B0</b>–<b>B6</b>”, “<b>C0</b>–<b>C6</b>”, and
              “<b>D0</b>–<b>D6</b>”; the U.S. formats “<b>letter</b>”, “<b>legal</b>”, “<b>tabloid</b>”,
              “<b>ledger</b>”, “<b>statement</b>”, and “<b>executive</b>”; and the envelope
              formats “<b>com10</b>”, “<b>monarch</b>”, and “<b>DL</b>”.  All formats, even
              those for envelopes, are in portrait orientation: the
              longer measurement is vertical.  Appending “l” (ell) to
              any of these denotes landscape orientation instead.  This
              macro file assumes one-inch horizontal margins, and sets
              registers recognized by the <i>groff man</i>, <i>mdoc</i>, <i>mm</i>, <i>mom</i>, and
              <i>ms</i> packages to configure them accordingly.  If you want
              different margins, you will need to use those packages'
              facilities, or <i>troff</i> <b>ll </b>and/or <b>po </b>requests, to adjust
              them.  An output device typically requires command-line
              options <b>-p </b>and <b>-l </b>to override the paper dimensions and
              orientation, respectively, defined in its <i>DESC</i> file; see
              subsection “Paper format” of <i>groff</i>(1).  This macro file is
              normally loaded at startup by the <i>troffrc</i> file when
              formatting for a typesetter (but not a terminal).

       <i>pdfpic</i> provides a single macro, <b>PDFPIC</b>, to include a PDF graphic
              in a document using features of the <b>pdf </b>output driver.
              For other output devices, <b>PDFPIC </b>calls <b>PSPIC</b>, with which
              it shares an interface (see below).  This macro file is
              normally loaded at startup by the <i>troffrc</i> file.

       <i>pic</i>    supplies definitions of the macros <b>PS</b>, <b>PE</b>, and <b>PF</b>, usable
              with the <i>pic</i>(1) preprocessor.  They center each picture.
              Use it if your document does not use a full-service macro
              package, or that package does not supply working <i>pic</i> macro
              definitions.  Except for <i>man</i> and <i>mdoc</i>, those provided with
              <i>groff</i> already do so (exception: <i>mm</i> employs the name <b>PF </b>for
              a different purpose).

       <i>pspic</i>  provides a macro, <b>PSPIC</b>, that includes a PostScript
              graphic in a document.  The <b>ps</b>, <b>dvi</b>, <b>html</b>, and <b>xhtml</b>
              output devices support such inclusions; for all other
              drivers, the image is replaced with a rectangular border
              of the same size.  <i>pspic.tmac</i> is loaded at startup by the
              <i>troffrc</i> file.

              Its syntax is as follows.

                     <b>.PSPIC </b>[<b>-L</b>|<b>-R</b>|<b>-C</b>|<b>-I </b><i>n</i>] <i>file</i> [<i>width</i> [<i>height</i>]]

              <i>file</i> is the name of the PostScript file; <i>width</i> and <i>height</i>
              give the desired width and height of the image.  If
              neither a <i>width</i> nor a <i>height</i> argument is specified, the
              image's natural width (as given in the file's bounding
              box) or the current line length is used as the width,
              whatever is smaller.  The <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> arguments may
              have scaling units attached; the default scaling unit
              is <b>i</b>.  <b>PSPIC </b>scales the graphic uniformly in the
              horizontal and vertical directions so that it is no more
              than <i>width</i> wide and <i>height</i> high.  Option <b>-C </b>centers the
              graphic horizontally; this is the default.  <b>-L </b>and <b>-R</b>
              left- and right-align the graphic, respectively.  <b>-I</b>
              indents the graphic by <i>n</i> (with a default scaling unit
              of <b>m</b>).

              To use <b>PSPIC </b>within a diversion, we recommend extending it
              with the following code, assuring that the diversion's
              width completely covers the image's width.

                     .am PSPIC
                     .  vpt 0
                     \h'(\\n[ps-offset]u + \\n[ps-deswid]u)'
                     .  sp -1
                     .  vpt 1
                     ..

              Failure to load <b>PSPIC</b>'s image argument is not an error.
              (The <b>psbb </b>request does issue an error diagnostic.)  To
              make such a failure fatal, append to the <b>pspic*error-hook</b>
              macro.

                     .am pspic*error-hook
                     .  ab
                     ..

       <i>ptx</i>    provides a macro, <b>xx</b>, to format permuted index entries as
              produced by the GNU <i>ptx</i>(1) program.  If your formatting
              needs differ, copy the macro into your document and adapt
              it.

       <i>rfc1345</i>
              defines special character escape sequences named for the
              glyph mnemonics specified in RFC 1345 and the digraph
              table of the Vim text editor.  See <i>groff_rfc1345</i>(7).

       <i>sboxes</i> offers an interface to the “<b>pdf: background</b>” device
              control command supported by <i>gropdf</i>(1).  Using this
              package, <i>groff ms</i> documents can draw colored rectangles
              beneath any output.

              <b>.BOXSTART SHADED </b><i>color</i> <b>OUTLINED </b><i>color</i> <b>INDENT </b><i>size</i> <b>WEIGHT </b><i>size</i>
                     begins a box, where the argument after <b>SHADED </b>gives
                     the fill color and that after <b>OUTLINED </b>the border
                     color.  Omit the former to get a borderless filled
                     box and the latter for a border with no fill.  The
                     specified <b>WEIGHT </b>is used if the box is <b>OUTLINED</b>.

                     <b>INDENT </b>precedes a value that leaves a gap between
                     the border and the contents inside the box.

                     Each <i>color</i> must be a defined <i>groff</i> color name, and
                     each <i>size</i> a valid <i>groff</i> numeric expression.  The
                     keyword/value pairs can be specified in any order.

              Boxes can be stacked, so you can start a box within
              another box; usually the later boxes would be smaller than
              the containing box, but this is not enforced.  When using
              <b>BOXSTART</b>, the left position is the current indent minus
              the <b>INDENT </b>in the command, and the right position is the
              left position (calculated above) plus the current line
              length and twice the indent.

              <b>.BOXSTOP</b>
                     takes no parameters.  It closes the most recently
                     started box at the current vertical position after
                     adding its <b>INDENT </b>spacing.

              Your <i>groff</i> documents can conditionally exercise the <i>sboxes</i>
              macros.  The register <b>GSBOX </b>is defined if the package is
              loaded, and interpolates a true value if the <b>pdf </b>output
              device is in use.

              <i>sboxes</i> furthermore hooks into the <i>groff_ms</i>(7) package to
              receive notifications when footnotes are growing, so that
              it can close boxes on a page before footnotes are printed.
              When that condition obtains, <i>sboxes</i> will close open boxes
              two points above the footnote separator and re-open them
              on the next page.  (This amount probably will not match
              the box's <b>INDENT</b>.)

              See “Using PDF boxes with <i>groff</i> and the <i>ms</i> macros”
              ⟨file:///usr/local/share/doc/groff-1.23.0/msboxes.pdf⟩ for
              a demonstration.

       <i>trace</i>  aids the debugging of <i>groff</i> documents by tracing macro
              calls.  See <i>groff_trace</i>(7).

       <i>www</i>    defines macros corresponding to HTML elements.  See
              <i>groff_www</i>(7).
</pre> <h2>
Naming </h2>
<pre>
       AT&amp;T <i>nroff</i> and <i>troff</i> were implemented before the conventions of
       the modern C <i>getopt</i>(3) call evolved, and used a naming scheme for
       macro packages that looks oddly terse to modern eyes.  The
       formatter's <b>-m </b>option was the main means of loading a macro
       package, and its argument had to follow immediately without
       intervening space.  This looked like a long option name preceded
       by a single minus—a sensation in the computer stone age.  Macro
       packages therefore came to be known by names that started with
       the letter “m”, which was omitted from the name of the macro file
       as stored on disk.  For example, the manuscript macro package was
       stored as <i>tmac.s</i> and loaded with the option <b>-ms</b>.  It has since
       become conventional in operating systems to use a suffixed file
       name extension to suggest a file type or format, thus we see <i>roff</i>
       documents with names ending in <i>.man</i>, <i>.me</i>, and so on.

       <i>groff</i> commands permit space between an option and its argument.
       The syntax “<b>groff -m s</b>” makes the macro file name more clear but
       may surprise users familiar with the original convention, unaware
       that the package's “real” name was “s” all along.  For such
       packages of long pedigree, <i>groff</i> accommodates different users'
       expectations by supplying wrapper macro files that load the
       desired file with <b>mso </b>requests.  Thus, all of “<b>groff -m s</b>”,
       “<b>groff -m ms</b>”, “<b>groff -ms</b>”, and “<b>groff -mms</b>” serve to load the
       manuscript macros.
</pre> <h2>
Inclusion </h2>
<pre>
       The traditional method of employing a macro package is to specify
       the “<b>-m </b><i>package</i>” option to the formatter, which then reads
       <i>package</i>'s macro file prior to any input files.  Historically,
       <i>package</i> was sought in a file named <i>tmac.</i>package (that is, with a
       “<b>tmac.</b>” prefix).  GNU <i>troff</i> searches for package<i>.tmac</i> in the
       macro path; if not found, it looks for <i>tmac.</i>package instead, and
       vice versa.

       Alternatively, one could include a macro file with the request
       “<b>so </b><i>file-name</i>”; the argument is resolved as <i>fopen</i>(3) would, from
       the current working directory of the formatter.  This approach
       was inadequate to locate macro packages, since systems stored
       them in varying locations.  GNU <i>troff</i> offers an improved feature
       in the similar request “<b>mso </b><i>package-file-name</i>”, which searches
       the macro path for <i>package-file-name</i>.  Because its argument is a
       file name, its “<b>.tmac</b>” component must be included for the file to
       be found.

       If a sourced file requires preprocessing, for example if it
       includes <i>tbl</i> tables or <i>eqn</i> equations, the preprocessor <i>soelim</i>(1)
       must be used.  This can be achieved with a pipeline or by
       specifying the <b>-s </b>option to <i>groff</i>(1).  <i>man</i>(1) librarian programs
       typically run <i>soelim</i> automatically.  (As a rule, macro packages
       themselves do not require preprocessing.)

Writing macros </h2>
<pre>
       A <i>roff</i>(7) document is a text file that is enriched by predefined
       formatting constructs, such as requests, escape sequences,
       strings, numeric registers, and macros from a macro package.
       <i>roff</i>(7) describes these elements.

       To give a document a personal style, it is most useful to extend
       the existing elements by defining some macros for repeating
       tasks; the best place for this is near the beginning of the
       document or in a separate file.

       Macros without arguments are just like strings.  But the full
       power of macros occurs when arguments are passed with a macro
       call.  Within the macro definition, the arguments are available
       as the escape sequences <b>\$1</b>, ..., <b>\$9</b>, <b>\$[</b>...<b>]</b>, <b>\$*</b>, and <b>\$@</b>, the
       name under which the macro was called is in <b>\$0</b>, and the number
       of arguments is in register <b>\n[.$]</b>; see <i>groff</i>(7).

   <b>Drafting macros</b>
       Temporarily disabling the escape mechanism can ease macro
       composition; bracket a macro definition with <b>eo </b>and <b>ec </b>requests.
              .eo
              .ds midpart was called with the following
              .de print_args
              \f[I]\$0\f[] \*[midpart] \n[.$] arguments:
              \$*
              ..
              .ec

       This drafting procedure has limitations; it is unsuitable for a
       macro that requires certain interpolations at the time it is
       defined, or for indirect definitions of identifiers.  See section
       “Copy mode” of <i>groff</i>(7).  In such cases, you might define and
       test the macro with the escape character doubled before escape
       sequences that are interpreted even in copy mode, then bracket it
       with <b>eo </b>and <b>ec </b>requests, un-double the escape characters, then
       test again.

   <b>Tips for macro definitions</b>
       •  Use only control lines in macro definitions; that is, start
          every input line with a control character.  <i>groff</i>'s <b>nop</b>
          request makes use of text lines unnecessary.

                 .de Text
                 .  if (\\n[.$] == 0) \
                 .    return
                 .  nop \&amp;\\$*\&amp;
                 ..

       •  Write a comment macro that works in both draft and non-draft
          modes; since the escape character is disabled in draft mode,
          trouble might occur when comment escape sequences are used.
          For example, the following macro ignores its arguments, so
          calling it is a harmless (if somewhat busy) null operation.

                 .de c
                 ..
                 .c This is my comment.

       •  Comment lengthy macro definitions.

       •  Use empty requests, and indentation after control characters,
          to clarify a macro's structure.
