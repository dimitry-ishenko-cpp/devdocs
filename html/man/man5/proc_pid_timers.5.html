DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/timers</i> (since Linux 3.10)
              A list of the POSIX timers for this process.  Each timer
              is listed with a line that starts with the string "ID:".
              For example:

                  ID: 1
                  signal: 60/00007fff86e452a8
                  notify: signal/pid.2634
                  ClockID: 0
                  ID: 0
                  signal: 60/00007fff86e452a8
                  notify: signal/pid.2634
                  ClockID: 1

              The lines shown for each timer have the following
              meanings:

              <i>ID</i>     The ID for this timer.  This is not the same as the
                     timer ID returned by <a href="../man2/timer_create.2.html">timer_create(2)</a>; rather, it is
                     the same kernel-internal ID that is available via
                     the <i>si_timerid</i> field of the <i>siginfo_t</i> structure
                     (see <a href="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2)</a>).

              <i>signal</i> This is the signal number that this timer uses to
                     deliver notifications followed by a slash, and then
                     the <i>sigev_value</i> value supplied to the signal
                     handler.  Valid only for timers that notify via a
                     signal.

              <i>notify</i> The part before the slash specifies the mechanism
                     that this timer uses to deliver notifications, and
                     is one of "thread", "signal", or "none".
                     Immediately following the slash is either the
                     string "tid" for timers with <b>SIGEV_THREAD_ID</b>
                     notification, or "pid" for timers that notify by
                     other mechanisms.  Following the "." is the PID of
                     the process (or the kernel thread ID of the thread)
                     that will be delivered a signal if the timer
                     delivers notifications via a signal.

              <i>ClockID</i>
                     This field identifies the clock that the timer uses
                     for measuring time.  For most clocks, this is a
                     number that matches one of the user-space <b>CLOCK_*</b>
                     constants exposed via <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.
                     <b>CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID </b>timers display with a
                     value of -6 in this field.  <b>CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID</b>
                     timers display with a value of -2 in this field.

              This file is available only when the kernel was configured
              with <b>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</b>.
