NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb - Debian binary package format
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>filename</i><b>.deb</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>.deb </b>format is the Debian binary package file format.  It is
       understood since dpkg 0.93.76, and is generated by default since
       dpkg 1.2.0 and 1.1.1elf (i386/ELF builds).

       The format described here is used since Debian 0.93; details of
       the old format are described in <a href="deb-old.5.html">deb-old(5)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The file is an <b>ar </b>archive with a magic value of <b>!&lt;arch&gt;</b>.  Only
       the common <b>ar </b>archive format is supported, with no long file name
       extensions, but with file names containing an optional trailing
       slash, which limits their length to 15 characters (from the 16
       allowed).  File sizes are limited to 10 ASCII decimal digits,
       allowing for up to approximately 9536.74 MiB member files.

       The <b>tar </b>archives currently allowed are, the old-style (v7)
       format, the pre-POSIX ustar format, a subset of the GNU format
       (new style long pathnames and long linknames, supported since
       dpkg 1.4.1.17; large file metadata since dpkg 1.18.24), and the
       POSIX ustar format (long names supported since dpkg 1.15.0).
       Unrecognized tar typeflags are considered an error.  Each tar
       entry size inside a tar archive is limited to 11 ASCII octal
       digits, allowing for up to 8 GiB tar entries.  The GNU large file
       metadata support permits 95-bit tar entry sizes and negative
       timestamps, and 63-bit UID, GID and device numbers.

       The first member is named <b>debian-binary </b>and contains a series of
       lines, separated by newlines.  Currently only one line is
       present, the format version number, <b>2.0 </b>at the time this manual
       page was written.  Programs which read new-format archives should
       be prepared for the minor number to be increased and new lines to
       be present, and should ignore these if this is the case.

       If the major number has changed, an incompatible change has been
       made and the program should stop.  If it has not, then the
       program should be able to safely continue, unless it encounters
       an unexpected member in the archive (except at the end), as
       described below.

       The second required member is named <b>control.tar</b>.  It is a tar
       archive containing the package control information, either not
       compressed (supported since dpkg 1.17.6), or compressed with gzip
       (with <b>.gz </b>extension) or xz (with <b>.xz </b>extension, supported since
       1.17.6), zstd (with <b>.zst </b>extension, supported since dpkg
       1.21.18), as a series of plain files, of which the file <b>control</b>
       is mandatory and contains the core control information, the
       <b>md5sums</b>, <b>conffiles</b>, <b>triggers</b>, <b>shlibs </b>and <b>symbols </b>files contain
       optional control information, and the <b>preinst</b>, <b>postinst</b>, <b>prerm</b>
       and <b>postrm </b>files are optional maintainer scripts.  The control
       tarball may optionally contain an entry for ‘<b>.</b>’, the current
       directory.

       The third, last required member is named <b>data.tar</b>.  It contains
       the filesystem as a tar archive, either not compressed (supported
       since dpkg 1.10.24), or compressed with gzip (with <b>.gz</b>
       extension), xz (with <b>.xz </b>extension, supported since dpkg 1.15.6),
       zstd (with <b>.zst </b>extension, supported since dpkg 1.21.18), bzip2
       (with <b>.bz2 </b>extension, supported since dpkg 1.10.24) or lzma (with
       <b>.lzma </b>extension, supported since dpkg 1.13.25).

       These members must occur in this exact order.  Current
       implementations should ignore any additional members after
       <b>data.tar</b>.  Further members may be defined in the future, and (if
       possible) will be placed after these three.  Any additional
       members that may need to be inserted after <b>debian-binary </b>and
       before <b>control.tar </b>or <b>data.tar </b>and which should be safely ignored
       by older programs, will have names starting with an underscore,
       ‘<b>_</b>’.

       Those new members which won't be able to be safely ignored will
       be inserted before <b>data.tar </b>with names starting with something
       other than underscores, or will (more likely) cause the major
       version number to be increased.
