NAME </h2>
<pre>
       time.conf - configuration file for the pam_time module
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_time PAM module does not authenticate the user, but
       instead it restricts access to a system and or specific
       applications at various times of the day and on specific days or
       over various terminal lines. This module can be configured to
       deny access to (individual) users based on their name, the time
       of day, the day of week, the service they are applying for and
       their terminal from which they are making their request.

       For this module to function correctly there must be a correctly
       formatted /etc/security/time.conf file present. White spaces are
       ignored and lines maybe extended with '\' (escaped newlines).
       Text following a '#' is ignored to the end of the line.

       The syntax of the lines is as follows:

       <i>services</i>;<i>ttys</i>;<i>users</i>;<i>times</i>

       In words, each rule occupies a line, terminated with a newline or
       the beginning of a comment; a '<b>#</b>'. It contains four fields
       separated with semicolons, '<b>;</b>'.

       The first field, the <i>services</i> field, is a logic list of PAM
       service names that the rule applies to.

       The second field, the <i>tty</i> field, is a logic list of terminal
       names that this rule applies to.

       The third field, the <i>users</i> field, is a logic list of users or a
       netgroup of users to whom this rule applies.

       A logic list namely means individual tokens that are optionally
       prefixed with '!' (logical not) and separated with '&amp;' (logical
       and) and '|' (logical or).

       For these items the simple wildcard '*' may be used only once.
       With netgroups no wildcards or logic operators are allowed.

       The <i>times</i> field is used to indicate the times at which this rule
       applies. The format here is a logic list of day/time-range
       entries. The days are specified by a sequence of two character
       entries, MoTuSa for example is Monday Tuesday and Saturday. Note
       that repeated days are unset MoMo = no day, and MoWk = all
       weekdays bar Monday. The two character combinations accepted are
       Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su Wk Wd Al, the last two being week-end days
       and all 7 days of the week respectively. As a final example, AlFr
       means all days except Friday.

       Each day/time-range can be prefixed with a '!' to indicate
       "anything but". The time-range part is two 24-hour times HHMM,
       separated by a hyphen, indicating the start and finish time (if
       the finish time is smaller than the start time it is deemed to
       apply on the following day).

       For a rule to be active, ALL of service+ttys+users must be
       satisfied by the applying process.

       Note, currently there is no daemon enforcing the end of a
       session. This needs to be remedied.

       Poorly formatted rules are logged as errors using <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       These are some example lines which might be specified in
       /etc/security/time.conf.

       All users except for <i>root</i> are denied access to console-login at
       all times:

           login ; tty* &amp; !ttyp* ; !root ; !Al0000-2400

       Games (configured to use PAM) are only to be accessed out of
       working hours. This rule does not apply to the user <i>waster</i>:

           games ; * ; !waster ; Wd0000-2400 | Wk1800-0800
