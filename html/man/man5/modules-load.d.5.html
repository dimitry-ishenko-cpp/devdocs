NAME </h2>
<pre>
       modules-load.d - Configure kernel modules to load at boot
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
           /etc/modules-load.d/*.conf
           /run/modules-load.d/*.conf
           /usr/local/lib/modules-load.d/*.conf
           /usr/lib/modules-load.d/*.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="../man8/systemd-modules-load.service.8.html">systemd-modules-load.service(8)</a> reads files from the above
       directories which contain kernel modules to load during boot in a
       static list. Each configuration file is named in the style of
       /etc/modules-load.d/<i>program</i>.conf. Note that it is usually a
       better idea to rely on the automatic module loading by PCI IDs,
       USB IDs, DMI IDs or similar triggers encoded in the kernel
       modules themselves instead of static configuration like this. In
       fact, most modern kernel modules are prepared for automatic
       loading already.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The configuration files should simply contain a list of kernel
       module names to load, separated by newlines. Empty lines and
       lines whose first non-whitespace character is # or ; are ignored.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE </h2>
<pre>
       Configuration files are read from directories in /etc/, /run/,
       /usr/local/lib/, and /usr/lib/, in order of precedence, as listed
       in the SYNOPSIS section above. Files must have the ".conf"
       extension. Files in /etc/ override files with the same name in
       /run/, /usr/local/lib/, and /usr/lib/. Files in /run/ override
       files with the same name under /usr/.

       All configuration files are sorted by their filename in
       lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they
       reside in. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry
       in the file with the lexicographically latest name will take
       precedence. Thus, the configuration in a certain file may either
       be replaced completely (by placing a file with the same name in a
       directory with higher priority), or individual settings might be
       changed (by specifying additional settings in a file with a
       different name that is ordered later).

       Packages should install their configuration files in /usr/lib/
       (distribution packages) or /usr/local/lib/ (local installs) [1].
       Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may
       use this logic to override the configuration files installed by
       vendor packages.

       It is recommended to prefix all filenames with a two-digit number
       and a dash to simplify the ordering. It is recommended to use the
       range 10-40 for configuration files in /usr/ and the range 60-90
       for configuration files in /etc/ and /run/, to make sure that
       local and transient configuration files will always take priority
       over configuration files shipped by the OS vendor.

       If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file
       supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink
       to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with the
       same filename as the vendor configuration file. If the vendor
       configuration file is included in the initrd image, the image has
       to be regenerated.

EXAMPLE </h2>

       <b>Example 1. /etc/modules-load.d/virtio-net.conf example:</b>

           # Load virtio-net.ko at boot
           virtio-net

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
        1. ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£ Please note that those configuration files must
           be available at all times. If /usr/local/ is a separate
           partition, it may not be available during early boot, and
           must not be used for configuration.
