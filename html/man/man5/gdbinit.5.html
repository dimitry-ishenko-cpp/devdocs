NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gdbinit - GDB initialization scripts
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ~/.config/gdb/gdbinit

       ~/.gdbinit

       ./.gdbinit
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These files contain GDB commands to automatically execute during
       GDB startup.  The lines of contents are canned sequences of
       commands, described in the GDB manual in node "Sequences" --
       shell command "info -f gdb -n Sequences".

       Please read more in the GDB manual in node "Startup" -- shell
       command "info -f gdb -n Startup".

       <b>(not enabled with "--with-system-gdbinit" during compilation)</b>
           System-wide initialization file.  It is executed unless user
           specified GDB option "-nx" or "-n".  See more in the GDB
           manual in node "System-wide configuration" -- shell command
           "info -f gdb -n 'System-wide configuration'".

       <b>(not enabled with "--with-system-gdbinit-dir" during compilation)</b>
           System-wide initialization directory.  All files in this
           directory are executed on startup unless user specified GDB
           option "-nx" or "-n", as long as they have a recognized file
           extension.  See more in the GDB manual in node "System-wide
           configuration" -- shell command "info -f gdb -n 'System-wide
           configuration'".

       [1m~/.config/gdb/gdbinit[24m or <i>~/.gdbinit</i>
           User initialization file.  It is executed unless user
           specified GDB options "-nx", "-n" or "-nh".

       <b>.gdbinit</b>
           Initialization file for current directory.  It may need to be
           enabled with GDB security command "set auto-load
           local-gdbinit".  See more in the GDB manual in node "Init
           File in the Current Directory" -- shell command "info -f gdb
           -n 'Init File in the Current Directory'".

       The full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
       If the "info" and "gdb" programs and GDB's Texinfo documentation
       are properly installed at your site, the command

               info gdb

       should give you access to the complete manual.
