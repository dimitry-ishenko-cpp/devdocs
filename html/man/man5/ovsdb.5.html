</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       OVSDB, the Open vSwitch Database, is a database system whose
       network protocol is specified by RFC 7047.  The RFC does not
       specify an on-disk storage format.  The OVSDB implementation in
       Open vSwitch implements two storage formats: one for standalone
       (and active-backup) databases, and the other for clustered
       databases.  This manpage documents both of these formats.

       Most users do not need to be concerned with this specification.
       Instead, to manipulate OVSDB files, refer to <a href="../man1/ovsdb-tool.1.html">ovsdb-tool(1)</a>.  For
       an introduction to OVSDB as a whole, read <a href="../man7/ovsdb.7.html">ovsdb(7)</a>.

       OVSDB files explicitly record changes that are implied by the
       database schema.  For example, the OVSDB “garbage collection”
       feature means that when a client removes the last reference to a
       garbage-collected row, the database server automatically removes
       that row.  The database file explicitly records the deletion of
       the garbage-collected row, so that the reader does not need to
       infer it.

       OVSDB files do not include the values of ephemeral columns.

       Standalone and clustered database files share the common
       structure described here.  They are text files encoded in UTF-8
       with LF (U+000A) line ends, organized as append-only series of
       records.  Each record consists of 2 lines of text.

       The first line in each record has the format <b>OVSDB &lt;magic&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;length&gt; &lt;hash&gt;</b>, where &lt;magic&gt; is <b>JSON </b>for standalone databases
       or <b>CLUSTER </b>for clustered databases, &lt;length&gt; is a positive
       decimal integer, and &lt;hash&gt; is a SHA-1 checksum expressed as 40
       hexadecimal digits.  Words in the first line must be separated by
       exactly one space.

       The second line must be exactly <i>length</i> bytes long (including the
       LF) and its SHA-1 checksum (including the LF) must match <i>hash</i>
       exactly.  The line’s contents must be a valid JSON object as
       specified by RFC 4627.  Strings in the JSON object must be valid
       UTF-8.  To ensure that the second line is exactly one line of
       text, the OVSDB implementation expresses any LF characters within
       a JSON string as <b>\n</b>.  For the same reason, and to save space, the
       OVSDB implementation does not “pretty print” the JSON object with
       spaces and LFs.  (The OVSDB implementation tolerates LFs when
       reading an OVSDB database file, as long as <i>length</i> and <i>hash</i> are
       correct.)

   <b>JSON Notation</b>
       We use notation from RFC 7047 here to describe the JSON data in
       records.  In addition to the notation defined there, we add the
       following:

       <b>&lt;raw-uuid&gt;</b>
              A 36-character JSON string that contains a UUID in the
              format described by RFC 4122, e.g.
              <b>"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"</b>

   <b>Standalone Format</b>
       The first record in a standalone database contains the JSON
       schema for the database, as specified in RFC 7047.  Only this
       record is mandatory (a standalone file that contains only a
       schema represents an empty database).

       The second and subsequent records in a standalone database are
       transaction records.  Each record may have the following optional
       special members, which do not have any semantics but are often
       useful to administrators looking through a database log with
       <b>ovsdb-tool show-log</b>:

       <b>"_date": &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              The time at which the transaction was committed, as an
              integer number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
              Early versions of OVSDB counted seconds instead of
              milliseconds; these can be detected by noticing that their
              values are less than 2**32.

              OVSDB always writes a <b>_date </b>member.

       <b>"_comment": &lt;string&gt;</b>
              A JSON string that specifies the comment provided in a
              transaction <b>comment </b>operation.  If a transaction has
              multiple <b>comment </b>operations, OVSDB concatenates them into
              a single <b>_comment </b>member, separated by a new-line.

              OVSDB only writes a <b>_comment </b>member if it would be a
              nonempty string.

       Each of these records also has one or more additional members,
       each of which maps from the name of a database table to a
       &lt;table-txn&gt;:

       <b>&lt;table-txn&gt;</b>
              A JSON object that describes the effects of a transaction
              on a database table.  Its names are &lt;raw-uuid&gt;s for rows
              in the table and its values are &lt;row-txn&gt;s.

       <b>&lt;row-txn&gt;</b>
              Either <b>null</b>, which indicates that the transaction deleted
              this row, or a JSON object that describes how the
              transaction inserted or modified the row, whose names are
              the names of columns and whose values are &lt;value&gt;s that
              give the column’s new value.

              For new rows, the OVSDB implementation omits columns whose
              values have the default values for their types defined in
              RFC 7047 section 5.2.1; for modified rows, the OVSDB
              implementation omits columns whose values are unchanged.

   <b>Clustered Format</b>
       The clustered format has the following additional notation:

       <b>&lt;uint64&gt;</b>
              A JSON integer that represents a 64-bit unsigned integer.
              The OVS JSON implementation only supports integers in the
              range -2**63 through 2**63-1, so 64-bit unsigned integer
              values from 2**63 through 2**64-1 are expressed as
              negative numbers.

       <b>&lt;address&gt;</b>
              A JSON string that represents a network address to support
              clustering, in the <b>&lt;protocol&gt;:&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt; </b>syntax described
              in <a href="../man1/ovsdb-tool.1.html">ovsdb-tool(1)</a>.

       <b>&lt;servers&gt;</b>
              A JSON object whose names are &lt;raw-uuid&gt;s that identify
              servers and whose values are &lt;address&gt;es that specify
              those servers’ addresses.

       <b>&lt;cluster-txn&gt;</b>
              A JSON array with two elements:

              1. The first element is either a &lt;database-schema&gt; or
                 <b>null</b>.  A &lt;database-schema&gt; element is always present in
                 the first record of a clustered database to indicate
                 the database’s initial schema.  If it is not <b>null </b>in a
                 later record, it indicates a change of schema for the
                 database.

              2. The second element is either a transaction record in
                 the format described under <b>Standalone Format </b>above, or
                 <b>null</b>.

              When a schema is present, the transaction record is
              relative to an empty database.  That is, a schema change
              effectively resets the database to empty and the
              transaction record represents the full database contents.
              This allows readers to be ignorant of the full semantics
              of schema change.

       The first record in a clustered database contains the following
       members, all of which are required, except <b>prev_election_timer</b>:

       <b>"server_id": &lt;raw-uuid&gt;</b>
              The server’s own UUID, which must be unique within the
              cluster.

       <b>"local_address": &lt;address&gt;</b>
              The address on which the server listens for connections
              from other servers in the cluster.

       <b>"name": &lt;id&gt;</b>
              The database schema name.  It is only important when a
              server is in the process of joining a cluster: a server
              will only join a cluster if the name matches.  (If the
              database schema name were unique, then we would not also
              need a cluster ID.)

       <b>"cluster_id": &lt;raw-uuid&gt;</b>
              The cluster’s UUID.  The all-zeros UUID is not a valid
              cluster ID.

       <b>"prev_term": &lt;uint64&gt; and "prev_index": &lt;uint64&gt;</b>
              The Raft term and index just before the beginning of the
              log.

       <b>"prev_servers": &lt;servers&gt;</b>
              The set of one or more servers in the cluster at index
              “prev_index” and term “prev_term”.  It might not include
              this server, if it was not the initial server in the
              cluster.

       <b>"prev_election_timer": &lt;uint64&gt;</b>
              The election base time before the beginning of the log.
              If not exist, the default value 1000 ms is used as if it
              exists this record.

       <b>"prev_data": &lt;json-value&gt; and "prev_eid": &lt;raw-uuid&gt;</b>
              A snapshot of the data in the database at index
              “prev_index” and term “prev_term”, and the entry ID for
              that data.  The snapshot must contain a schema.

       The second and subsequent records, if present, in a clustered
       database represent changes to the database, to the cluster state,
       or both.  There are several types of these records.  The most
       important types of records directly represent persistent state
       described in the Raft specification:

       <b>Entry  </b>A Raft log entry.

       <b>Term   </b>The start of a new term.

       <b>Vote   </b>The server’s vote for a leader in the current term.

       The following additional types of records aid debugging and
       troubleshooting, but they do not affect correctness.

       <b>Leader </b>Identifies a newly elected leader for the current term.

       <b>Commit Index</b>
              An update to the server’s <b>commit_index</b>.

       <b>Note   </b>A human-readable description of some event.

       The table below identifies the members that each type of record
       contains.  “yes” indicates that a member is required, “?” that it
       is optional, blank that it is forbidden, and [1] that <b>data </b>and
       <b>eid </b>must be either both present or both absent.

       The members are:

       <b>"comment": &lt;string&gt;</b>
              A human-readable string giving an administrator more
              information about the reason a record was emitted.

       <b>"term": &lt;uint64&gt;</b>
              The term in which the activity occurred.

       <b>"index": &lt;uint64&gt;</b>
              The index of a log entry.

       <b>"servers": &lt;servers&gt;</b>
              Server configuration in a log entry.

       <b>"election_timer": &lt;uint64&gt;</b>
              Leader election timeout base value in a log entry.

       <b>"data": &lt;json-value&gt;</b>
              The data in a log entry.

       <b>"eid": &lt;raw-uuid&gt;</b>
              Entry ID in a log entry.

       <b>"vote": &lt;raw-uuid&gt;</b>
              The server ID for which this server voted.

       <b>"leader": &lt;raw-uuid&gt;</b>
              The server ID of the server.  Emitted by both leaders and
              followers when a leader is elected.

       <b>"commit_index": &lt;uint64&gt;</b>
              Updated <b>commit_index </b>value.

       <b>"note": &lt;string&gt;</b>
              One of a few special strings indicating important events.
              The currently defined strings are:

              <b>"transfer leadership"</b>
                     This server transferred leadership to a different
                     server (with details included in <b>comment</b>).

              <b>"left" </b>This server finished leaving the cluster.  (This
                     lets subsequent readers know that the server is not
                     part of the cluster and should not attempt to
                     connect to it.)

   <b>Joining a Cluster</b>
       In addition to general format for a clustered database, there is
       also a special case for a database file created by <b>ovsdb-tool</b>
       <b>join-cluster</b>.  Such a file contains exactly one record, which
       conveys the information passed to the <b>join-cluster </b>command.  It
       has the following members:

       <b>"server_id": &lt;raw-uuid&gt; and "local_address": &lt;address&gt; and</b>
       <b>"name": &lt;id&gt;</b>
              These have the same semantics described above in the
              general description of the format.

       <b>"cluster_id": &lt;raw-uuid&gt;</b>
              This is provided only if the user gave the <b>--cid </b>option to
              <b>join-cluster</b>.  It has the same semantics described above.

       <b>"remote_addresses"; [&lt;address&gt;*]</b>
              One or more remote servers to contact for joining the
              cluster.

       When the server successfully joins the cluster, the database file
       is replaced by one described in <i>Clustered Format</i>.
