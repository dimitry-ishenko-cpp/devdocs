NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-buildinfo - Debian build information file format
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>filename</i><b>.buildinfo</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Each Debian source package build can record the build information
       in a <b>.buildinfo </b>control file, which contains a number of fields
       in <a href="deb822.5.html">deb822(5)</a> format.

       Each field begins with a tag, such as <b>Source </b>or <b>Binary </b>(case
       insensitive), followed by a colon, and the body of the field
       (case sensitive unless stated otherwise).  Fields are delimited
       only by field tags.  In other words, field text may be multiple
       lines in length, but the installation tools will generally join
       lines when processing the body of the field (except in case of
       the multiline fields <b>Binary-Only-Changes</b>, <b>Installed-Build-</b>
       <b>Depends</b>, <b>Environment</b>, <b>Checksums-Md5</b>, <b>Checksums-Sha1 </b>and
       <b>Checksums-Sha256</b>, see below).

       The control data might be enclosed in an OpenPGP ASCII Armored
       signature, as specified in RFC4880.

       The name of the <b>.buildinfo </b>file will depend on the type of build
       and will be as specific as necessary but not more; the name will
       be:

       <i>source-name</i><b>_</b><i>binary-version</i><b>_</b><i>arch</i><b>.buildinfo</b>
           for a build that includes <b>any</b>

       <i>source-name</i><b>_</b><i>binary-version</i><b>_all.buildinfo</b>
           otherwise for a build that includes <b>all</b>

       <i>source-name</i><b>_</b><i>source-version</i><b>_source.buildinfo</b>
           otherwise for a build that includes <b>source</b>
</pre> <h2>
FIELDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Format: </b><i>format-version</i> (required)
           The value of this field declares the format version of the
           file.  The syntax of the field value is a version number with
           a major and minor component.  Backward incompatible changes
           to the format will bump the major version, and backward
           compatible changes (such as field additions) will bump the
           minor version.  The current format version is <b>1.0</b>.

       <b>Source: </b><i>source-name</i> [<b>(</b><i>source-version</i><b>)</b>] (required)
           The name of the source package.  If the source version
           differs from the binary version, then the <i>source-name</i> will be
           followed by a <i>source-version</i> in parenthesis.  This can happen
           when the build is for a binary-only non-maintainer upload.

       <b>Binary: </b><i>binary-package-list</i> (required in context)
           This folded field is a space-separated list of binary
           packages built.  If the build is source-only, then the field
           is omitted (since dpkg 1.20.0).

       <b>Architecture: </b><i>arch-list</i> (required)
           This space-separated field lists the architectures of the
           files currently being built.  Common architectures are <b>amd64</b>,
           <b>armel</b>, <b>i386</b>, etc.  Note that the <b>all </b>value is meant for
           packages that are architecture independent.  If the source
           for the package is also being built, the special entry <b>source</b>
           is also present.  Architecture wildcards must never be
           present in the list.

       <b>Version: </b><i>version-string</i> (required)
           Typically, this is the original package's version number in
           whatever form the program's author uses.  It may also include
           a Debian revision number (for non-native packages).  The
           exact format and sorting algorithm are described in
           <a href="../man7/deb-version.7.html">deb-version(7)</a>.

       <b>Binary-Only-Changes:</b>
        <i>changelog-entry</i>
           This multiline field contains the concatenated text of the
           changelog entry for a binary-only non-maintainer upload
           (binNMU) if that is the case.  To make this a valid multiline
           field empty lines are replaced with a single full stop (‘.’)
           and all lines are indented by one space character.  The exact
           content depends on the changelog format.

       <b>Checksums-Md5: </b>(required, weak)
       <b>Checksums-Sha1: </b>(required, weak)
       <b>Checksums-Sha256: </b>(required, strong)
        <i>checksum size filename</i>
           These multiline fields contain a list of files with a
           checksum and size for each one.  These fields have the same
           syntax and differ only in the checksum algorithm used: MD5
           for <b>Checksums-Md5</b>, SHA-1 for <b>Checksums-Sha1 </b>and SHA-256 for
           <b>Checksums-Sha256</b>.

           <b>Note</b>: The MD5 and SHA-1 checksums are considered weak, and
           should never be assumed to be sufficient for secure
           verification.

           The first line of the field value (the part on the same line
           as the field name followed by a colon) is always empty.  The
           content of the field is expressed as continuation lines, one
           line per file.  Each line consists of space-separated entries
           describing the file: the checksum, the file size, and the
           file name.

           These fields list all files that make up the build.

       <b>Build-Origin: </b><i>name</i>
           The name of the distribution this package is originating
           from.

       <b>Build-Architecture: </b><i>arch</i> (required)
           The Debian architecture for the installation the packages is
           being built in.  Common architectures are <b>amd64</b>, <b>armel</b>, <b>i386</b>,
           etc.

       <b>Build-Date: </b><i>build-date</i>
           The date the package was built.  It must be in the same
           format as the date in a <a href="deb-changelog.5.html">deb-changelog(5)</a> entry.

       <b>Build-Kernel-Version: </b><i>build-kernel-version</i>
           The release and version (in an unspecified format) of the
           kernel running on the build system.  This field is only going
           to be present if the builder has explicitly requested it, to
           avoid leaking possibly sensitive information.

       <b>Build-Path: </b><i>build-path</i>
           The absolute build path, which correspond to the unpacked
           source tree.  This field is only going to be present if the
           vendor has allowed it via some pattern match to avoid leaking
           possibly sensitive information.

           On Debian and derivatives only build paths starting with
           <i>/build/</i> will emit this field.

       <b>Build-Tainted-By:</b>
        <i>taint-reason-list</i>
           This folded field contains a space-separated list of non-
           exhaustive reason tags (formed by alphanumeric and dash
           characters) which identify why the current build has been
           tainted (since dpkg 1.19.5).

           On Debian and derivatives the following reason tags can be
           emitted:

           <b>merged-usr-via-aliased-dirs</b>
               The system has a merged <i>/usr</i> via aliased directories
               (previously known as <b>merged-usr-via-symlinks</b>).  This will
               confuse <b>dpkg-query</b>, <b>dpkg-statoverride</b>, <b>dpkg-trigger</b>,
               <b>update-alternatives </b>and any other tool using pathnames as
               keys into their databases, as it creates filesystem
               aliasing problems, and messes with the understanding of
               the filesystem that <b>dpkg </b>has recorded in its database.
               For build systems that hardcode pathnames to specific
               binaries or libraries on the resulting artifacts, it can
               also produce packages that will be incompatible with
               non-/usr-merged filesystems.

           <b>usr-local-has-configs</b>
               The system has configuration files under <i>/usr/local/etc</i>.

           <b>usr-local-has-includes</b>
               The system has header files under <i>/usr/local/include</i>.

           <b>usr-local-has-programs</b>
               The system has programs under <i>/usr/local/bin</i> or
               <i>/usr/local/sbin</i>.

           <b>usr-local-has-libraries</b>
               The system has libraries, either static or shared under
               <i>/usr/local/lib</i>.

           <b>can-execute-cross-built-programs</b>
               The system can execute cross built programs, either
               directly or via some emulation layer.

               Since dpkg 1.21.10.

       <b>Installed-Build-Depends: </b>(required)
        <i>package-list</i>
           The list of installed and configured packages that might
           affect the package build process.

           The list consists of each package name, optionally arch-
           qualified for foreign architectures, with an exact version
           restriction, separated by commas.

           The list includes all essential packages, packages listed in
           <b>Build-Depends</b>, <b>Build-Depends-Arch</b>, <b>Build-Depends-Indep </b>source
           control fields, any vendor specific builtin dependencies, and
           all their recursive dependencies.  On Debian and derivatives
           the dependency builtin is <b>build-essential</b>.

           For dependencies coming from the source control fields, all
           dependency alternatives and all providers of virtual packages
           depended on will be included.

       <b>Environment:</b>
        <i>variable-list</i>
           The list of environment variables that are known to affect
           the package build process, with each environment variable
           followed by an equal sign (‘=’) and the variable's quoted
           value, using double quotes (‘"’), and backslashes escaped
           (‘\\’).
