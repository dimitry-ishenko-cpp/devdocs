</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/anacrontab - configuration file for Anacron
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>/etc/anacrontab</i> configuration file describes the jobs
       controlled by <a href="../man8/anacron.8.html">anacron(8)</a>.  It can contain three types of lines:
       job-description lines, environment assignments, or empty lines.

       Job-description lines can have the following format:

          period in days   delay in minutes   job-identifier   command

       The <i>period in days</i> variable specifies the frequency of execution
       of a job in days.  This variable can be represented by an integer
       or a macro (@daily, @weekly, @monthly), where @daily denotes the
       same value as the integer 1, @weekly the same as 7, and @monthly
       specifies that the job is run once a month, independent on the
       length of the month.

       The <i>delay in minutes</i> variable specifies the number of minutes
       anacron waits, if necessary, before executing a job.  This
       variable is represented by an integer where 0 means no delay.

       The <i>job-identifier</i> variable specifies a unique name of a job
       which is used in the log files.

       The <i>command</i> variable specifies the command to execute.  The
       command can either be a command such as <b>ls /proc &gt;&gt; /tmp/proc </b>or
       a command to execute a custom script.

       Environment assignment lines can have the following format:

          VAR=VALUE

       Any spaces around <i>VAR</i> are removed.  No spaces around <i>VALUE</i> are
       allowed (unless you want them to be part of the value).  The
       specified assignment takes effect from the next line until the
       end of the file, or to the next assignment of the same variable.

       The <i>START_HOURS_RANGE</i> variable defines an interval (in hours)
       when scheduled jobs can be run.  In case this time interval is
       missed, for example, due to a power down, then scheduled jobs are
       not executed that day.

       The <i>RANDOM_DELAY</i> variable denotes the maximum number of minutes
       that will be added to the delay in minutes variable which is
       specified for each job.  A <i>RANDOM_DELAY</i> set to 12 would therefore
       add, randomly, between 0 and 12 minutes to the delay in minutes
       for each job in that particular anacrontab.  When set to 0, no
       random delay is added.

       If <i>MAILTO</i> is defined (and non-empty), mail is sent to the
       specified address, otherwise, system user is used.

       If <i>MAILFROM</i> is defined (and non-empty), it is used as the
       envelope sender address, otherwise, system user is used.

       (Note: Both <i>MAILFROM</i> and <i>MAILTO</i> variables are expanded, so
       setting them as in the following example works as expected:
       MAILFROM=cron-$USER@cron.com ($USER is replaced by the system
       user) )

       If <i>NO_MAIL_OUTPUT</i> is defined (and non-empty), the standard output
       and error descriptors of job processes are not redirected and e-
       mailed.

       Empty lines are either blank lines, line containing white spaces
       only, or lines with white spaces followed by a '#' followed by an
       arbitrary comment.

       You can continue a line onto the next line by adding a '\' at the
       end of it.

       In case you want to disable Anacron, add a line with <i>0anacron</i>
       which is the name of the script running the Anacron into the
       <i>/etc/cron.hourly/jobs.deny</i> file.

EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       This example shows how to set up an Anacron job similar in
       functionality to <i>/etc/crontab</i> which starts all regular jobs
       between 6:00 and 8:00 <i>only.</i>  A <i>RANDOM_DELAY</i> which can be 30
       minutes at the most is specified.  Jobs will run serialized in a
       queue where each job is started only after the previous one is
       finished.

       # environment variables
       SHELL=/bin/sh
       PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
       MAILTO=root
       RANDOM_DELAY=30
       # Anacron jobs will start between 6am and 8am.
       START_HOURS_RANGE=6-8
       # delay will be 5 minutes + RANDOM_DELAY for cron.daily
       1         5    cron.daily          nice run-parts /etc/cron.daily
       7         0    cron.weekly         nice run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
       @monthly  0    cron.monthly        nice run-parts /etc/cron.monthly
