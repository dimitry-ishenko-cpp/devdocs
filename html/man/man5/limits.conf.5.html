NAME </h2>
<pre>
       limits.conf - configuration file for the pam_limits module
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pam_limits.so</i> module applies ulimit limits, nice priority and
       number of simultaneous login sessions limit to user login
       sessions. This description of the configuration file syntax
       applies to the /etc/security/limits.conf file and *.conf files in
       the /etc/security/limits.d directory.

       The syntax of the lines is as follows:

       <i>&lt;domain&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;value&gt;</i>

       The fields listed above should be filled as follows:

       <b>&lt;domain&gt;</b>

           •   a username

           •   a groupname, with <b>@group </b>syntax. This should not be
               confused with netgroups.

           •   the wildcard <b>*</b>, for default entry.

           •   the wildcard <b>%</b>, for maxlogins limit only, can also be
               used with <b>%group </b>syntax. If the <b>% </b>wildcard is used alone
               it is identical to using <b>* </b>with maxsyslogins limit. With
               a group specified after <b>% </b>it limits the total number of
               logins of all users that are member of the group.

           •   an uid range specified as <i>&lt;min_uid&gt;</i><b>:</b><i>&lt;max_uid&gt;</i>. If min_uid
               is omitted, the match is exact for the max_uid. If
               max_uid is omitted, all uids greater than or equal
               min_uid match.

           •   a gid range specified as <b>@</b><i>&lt;min_gid&gt;</i><b>:</b><i>&lt;max_gid&gt;</i>. If min_gid
               is omitted, the match is exact for the max_gid. If
               max_gid is omitted, all gids greater than or equal
               min_gid match. For the exact match all groups including
               the user's supplementary groups are examined. For the
               range matches only the user's primary group is examined.

           •   a gid specified as <b>%:</b><i>&lt;gid&gt;</i> applicable to maxlogins limit
               only. It limits the total number of logins of all users
               that are member of the group with the specified gid.

       <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>

           <b>hard</b>
               for enforcing <b>hard </b>resource limits. These limits are set
               by the superuser and enforced by the Kernel. The user
               cannot raise his requirement of system resources above
               such values.

           <b>soft</b>
               for enforcing <b>soft </b>resource limits. These limits are ones
               that the user can move up or down within the permitted
               range by any pre-existing <b>hard </b>limits. The values
               specified with this token can be thought of as <i>default</i>
               values, for normal system usage.

           <b>-</b>
               for enforcing both <b>soft </b>and <b>hard </b>resource limits
               together.

               Note, if you specify a type of '-' but neglect to supply
               the item and value fields then the module will never
               enforce any limits on the specified user/group etc. .

       <b>&lt;item&gt;</b>

           <b>core</b>
               limits the core file size (KB)

           <b>data</b>
               maximum data size (KB)

           <b>fsize</b>
               maximum filesize (KB)

           <b>memlock</b>
               maximum locked-in-memory address space (KB)

           <b>nofile</b>
               maximum number of open file descriptors

           <b>rss</b>
               maximum resident set size (KB) (Ignored in Linux 2.4.30
               and higher)

           <b>stack</b>
               maximum stack size (KB)

           <b>cpu</b>
               maximum CPU time (minutes)

           <b>nproc</b>
               maximum number of processes

           <b>as</b>
               address space limit (KB)

           <b>maxlogins</b>
               maximum number of logins for this user (this limit does
               not apply to user with <i>uid=0</i>)

           <b>maxsyslogins</b>
               maximum number of all logins on system; user is not
               allowed to log-in if total number of all user logins is
               greater than specified number (this limit does not apply
               to user with <i>uid=0</i>)

           <b>nonewprivs</b>
               value of 0 or 1; if set to 1 disables acquiring new
               privileges by invoking prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)

           <b>priority</b>
               the priority to run user process with (negative values
               boost process priority)

           <b>locks</b>
               maximum locked files (Linux 2.4 and higher)

           <b>sigpending</b>
               maximum number of pending signals (Linux 2.6 and higher)

           <b>msgqueue</b>
               maximum memory used by POSIX message queues (bytes)
               (Linux 2.6 and higher)

           <b>nice</b>
               maximum nice priority allowed to raise to (Linux 2.6.12
               and higher) values: [-20,19]

           <b>rtprio</b>
               maximum realtime priority allowed for non-privileged
               processes (Linux 2.6.12 and higher)

       All items support the values <i>-1</i>, <i>unlimited</i> or <i>infinity</i> indicating
       no limit, except for <b>priority</b>, <b>nice</b>, and <b>nonewprivs</b>. If <b>nofile </b>is
       to be set to one of these values, it will be set to the contents
       of /proc/sys/fs/nr_open instead (see setrlimit(3)).

       If a hard limit or soft limit of a resource is set to a valid
       value, but outside of the supported range of the local system,
       the system may reject the new limit or unexpected behavior may
       occur. If the control value <i>required</i> is used, the module will
       reject the login if a limit could not be set.

       In general, individual limits have priority over group limits, so
       if you impose no limits for <i>admin</i> group, but one of the members
       in this group have a limits line, the user will have its limits
       set according to this line.

       Also, please note that all limit settings are set <i>per login</i>. They
       are not global, nor are they permanent; existing only for the
       duration of the session. One exception is the <i>maxlogin</i> option,
       this one is system wide. But there is a race, concurrent logins
       at the same time will not always be detect as such but only
       counted as one.

       In the <i>limits</i> configuration file, the '<b>#</b>' character introduces a
       comment - after which the rest of the line is ignored.

       The pam_limits module does report configuration problems found in
       its configuration file and errors via <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.
