DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/</i>
              There is a numerical subdirectory for each running
              process; the subdirectory is named by the process ID.
              Each <i>/proc/</i>pid subdirectory contains the pseudo-files and
              directories described below.

              The files inside each <i>/proc/</i>pid directory are normally
              owned by the effective user and effective group ID of the
              process.  However, as a security measure, the ownership is
              made <i>root:root</i> if the process's "dumpable" attribute is
              set to a value other than 1.

              Before Linux 4.11, <i>root:root</i> meant the "global" root user
              ID and group ID (i.e., UID 0 and GID 0 in the initial user
              namespace).  Since Linux 4.11, if the process is in a
              noninitial user namespace that has a valid mapping for
              user (group) ID 0 inside the namespace, then the user
              (group) ownership of the files under <i>/proc/</i>pid is instead
              made the same as the root user (group) ID of the
              namespace.  This means that inside a container, things
              work as expected for the container "root" user.

              The process's "dumpable" attribute may change for the
              following reasons:

              •  The attribute was explicitly set via the <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>
                 <b>PR_SET_DUMPABLE </b>operation.

              •  The attribute was reset to the value in the file
                 <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i> (described below), for the
                 reasons described in <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>.

              Resetting the "dumpable" attribute to 1 reverts the
              ownership of the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/*</i> files to the process's
              effective UID and GID.  Note, however, that if the
              effective UID or GID is subsequently modified, then the
              "dumpable" attribute may be reset, as described in
              <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>.  Therefore, it may be desirable to reset the
              "dumpable" attribute <i>after</i> making any desired changes to
              the process's effective UID or GID.

       <i>/proc/self/</i>
              This directory refers to the process accessing the <i>/proc</i>
              filesystem, and is identical to the <i>/proc</i> directory named
              by the process ID of the same process.
