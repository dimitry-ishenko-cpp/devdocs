NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-metadata - Information about an application or runtime
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Flatpak uses metadata files to describe applications and
       runtimes. The metadata file for a deployed application or runtime
       is placed in the toplevel deploy directory. For example, the
       metadata for the locally installed application
       org.gnome.Calculator is in
       ~/.local/share/flatpak/app/org.gnome.Calculator/current/active/metadata.

       Most aspects of the metadata configuration can be overridden when
       launching applications, either temporarily via options of the
       flatpak run command, or permanently with the flatpak override
       command.

       A metadata file describing the effective configuration is
       available inside the running sandbox at /.flatpak-info. For
       compatibility with older Flatpak versions,
       /run/user/$UID/flatpak-info is a symbolic link to the same file.
</pre> <h2>
FILE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The metadata file is using the same .ini file format that is used
       for systemd unit files or application .desktop files.

   <b>[Application] or [Runtime]</b>
       Metadata for applications starts with an [Application] group,
       metadata for runtimes with a [Runtime] group.

       The following keys can be present in these groups:

       <b>name </b>(string)
           The name of the application or runtime. This key is
           mandatory.

       <b>runtime </b>(string)
           The fully qualified name of the runtime that is used by the
           application. This key is mandatory for applications.

       <b>sdk </b>(string)
           The fully qualified name of the sdk that matches the runtime.
           Available since 0.1.

       <b>command </b>(string)
           The command to run. Only relevant for applications. Available
           since 0.1.

       <b>required-flatpak </b>(string list)
           The required version of Flatpak to run this application or
           runtime. For applications, this was available since 0.8.0.
           For runtimes, this was available since 0.9.1, and backported
           to 0.8.3 for the 0.8.x branch.

           Flatpak after version 1.4.3 and 1.2.5 support multiple
           versions here. This can be useful if you need to support
           features that are backported to a previous stable series. For
           example if you want to use a feature added in 1.6.0 that was
           also backported to 1.4.4 you would use 1.6.0;1.4.4;. Note
           that older versions of flatpak will just use the first
           element in the list, so make that the largest version.

       <b>tags </b>(string list)
           Tags to include in AppStream XML. Typical values in use on
           Flathub include <b>beta</b>, <b>stable</b>, <b>proprietary </b>and
           <b>upstream-maintained</b>. Available since 0.4.12.

   <b>[Context]</b>
       This group determines various system resources that may be shared
       with the application when it is run in a flatpak sandbox.

       All keys in this group (and the group itself) are optional.

       <b>shared </b>(list)
           List of subsystems to share with the host system. Possible
           subsystems: network, ipc. Available since 0.3.

       <b>sockets </b>(list)
           List of well-known sockets to make available in the sandbox.
           Possible sockets: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio,
           session-bus, system-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent,
           inherit-wayland-socket. When making a socket available,
           flatpak also sets well-known environment variables like
           DISPLAY or DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS to let the application
           find sockets that are not in a fixed location. Available
           since 0.3.

       <b>devices </b>(list)
           List of devices to make available in the sandbox. Possible
           values:

           <b>dri</b>
               Graphics direct rendering (/dev/dri). Available since
               0.3.

           <b>input</b>
               Input devices (/dev/input). Available since 1.15.6.

           <b>kvm</b>
               Virtualization (/dev/kvm). Available since 0.6.12.

           <b>all</b>
               All device nodes in /dev, but not /dev/shm (which is
               separately specified). Available since 0.6.6.

           <b>shm</b>
               Access to the host /dev/shm (/dev/shm). Available since
               1.6.1.

       <b>filesystems </b>(list)
           List of filesystem subsets to make available to the
           application. Possible values:

           <b>home</b>
               The entire home directory. Available since 0.3.

           <b>home/</b><i>path</i>
               Alias for ~/path Available since 1.10. For better
               compatibility with older Flatpak versions, prefer to
               write this as ~/path.

           <b>host</b>
               The entire host file system, except for directories that
               are handled specially by Flatpak. In particular, this
               shares /home, /media, /opt, /run/media and /srv if they
               exist.

               /dev is not shared: use <b>devices=all; </b>instead.

               Parts of /sys are always shared. This option does not
               make additional files in /sys available.

               Additionally, this keyword provides all of the same
               directories in /run/host as the <b>host-os </b>and <b>host-etc</b>
               keywords. If this keyword is used in conjunction with one
               of the <b>host- </b>keywords, whichever access level is higher
               (more permissive) will be used for the directories in
               /run/host: for example, host:rw;host-os:ro; is equivalent
               to host:rw;.

               These other reserved directories are currently excluded:
               /app, /bin, /boot, /efi, /etc, /lib, /lib32, /lib64,
               /proc, /root, /run, /sbin, /tmp, /usr, /var.

               Available since 0.3.

           <b>host-os</b>
               The host operating system's libraries, executables and
               static data from /usr and the related directories /bin,
               /lib, /lib32, /lib64, /sbin. Additionally, this keyword
               provides access to a subset of /etc that is associated
               with packaged libraries and executables, even if the
               <b>host-etc </b>keyword was not used: /etc/ld.so.cache, (used by
               the dynamic linker) and /etc/alternatives (on operating
               systems that use it, such as Debian).

               To avoid conflicting with the Flatpak runtime, these are
               mounted in the sandbox at /run/host/usr,
               /run/host/etc/ld.so.cache and so on.

               Available since 1.7.

           <b>host-etc</b>
               The host operating system's configuration from /etc.

               To avoid conflicting with the Flatpak runtime, this is
               mounted in the sandbox at /run/host/etc.

               Available since 1.7.

           <b>xdg-desktop</b>, <b>xdg-documents</b>, <b>xdg-download</b>, <b>xdg-music</b>,

           <b>xdg-cache</b>, <b>xdg-config</b>, <b>xdg-data</b>
               Directories defined by the <b>freedesktop.org Base Directory</b>
               <b>Specification</b>[2]. Available since 0.6.14.

           <b>xdg-cache/</b><i>path</i>, <b>xdg-config/</b><i>path</i>, <b>xdg-data/</b><i>path</i>
               Subdirectories of directories defined by the
               freedesktop.org Base Directory Specification. Available
               since 0.6.14.

           <b>xdg-run/</b><i>path</i>
               Subdirectories of the <b>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR </b>defined by the
               freedesktop.org Base Directory Specification. Note that
               <b>xdg-run </b>on its own is not supported. Available since
               0.4.13.

           <b>/</b><i>path</i>
               An arbitrary absolute path. Available since 0.3.

           <b>~/</b><i>path</i>
               An arbitrary path relative to the home directory.
               Available since 0.3.

           <b>~</b>
               The same as <b>home</b>. Available since 1.10. For better
               compatibility with older Flatpak versions, prefer to
               write this as <b>home</b>.

           One of the above followed by <b>:ro</b>
               Make the given directory available read-only.

           One of the above followed by <b>:rw</b>
               Make the given directory available read/write. This is
               the default.

           One of the above followed by <b>:create</b>
               Make the given directory available read/write, and create
               it if it does not already exist.

       <b>persistent </b>(list)
           List of homedir-relative paths to make available at the
           corresponding path in the per-application home directory,
           allowing the locations to be used for persistent data when
           the application does not have access to the real homedir. For
           instance making ".myapp" persistent would make "~/.myapp" in
           the sandbox a bind mount to "~/.var/app/org.my.App/.myapp",
           thus allowing an unmodified application to save data in the
           per-application location. Available since 0.3.

       <b>features </b>(list)
           List of features available or unavailable to the application,
           currently from the following list:

           <b>devel</b>
               Allow system calls used by development-oriented tools
               such as <b>perf</b>, <b>strace </b>and <b>gdb</b>. Available since 0.6.10.

           <b>multiarch</b>
               Allow running multilib/multiarch binaries, for example
               i386 binaries in an x86_64 environment. Available since
               0.6.12.

           <b>bluetooth</b>
               Allow the application to use bluetooth (AF_BLUETOOTH)
               sockets. Note, for bluetooth to fully work you must also
               have network access. Available since 0.11.8.

           <b>canbus</b>
               Allow the application to use canbus (AF_CAN) sockets.
               Note, for this work you must also have network access.
               Available since 1.0.3.

           <b>per-app-dev-shm</b>
               Share a single instance of /dev/shm between all instances
               of this application run by the same user ID, including
               sub-sandboxes. If the application has the <b>shm </b>device
               permission in its <b>devices </b>list, then this feature flag is
               ignored. Available since 1.12.0.

           A feature can be prefixed with <b>!  </b>to indicate the absence of
           that feature, for example <b>!devel </b>if development and debugging
           are not allowed.

       <b>unset-environment </b>(list)
           A list of names of environment variables to unset. Note that
           environment variables to set to a value (possibly empty)
           appear in the [Environment] group instead.

   <b>[Instance]</b>
       This group only appears in /.flatpak-info for a running app, and
       not in the metadata files written by application authors. It is
       filled in by Flatpak itself.

       <b>instance-id </b>(string)
           The ID of the running instance. This number is used as the
           name of the directory in <b>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</b>/.flatpak where
           Flatpak stores information about this instance.

       <b>instance-path </b>(string)
           The absolute path on the host system of the app's persistent
           storage area in $HOME/.var.

       <b>app-path </b>(string)
           The absolute path on the host system of the app's app files,
           as mounted at /app inside the container. Available since
           0.6.10.

           Since 1.12.0, if <b>flatpak run </b>was run with the <b>--app-path</b>
           option, this key gives the absolute path of whatever files
           were mounted on /app, even if that differs from the app's
           normal app files.

           If <b>flatpak run </b>was run with <b>--app-path= </b>(resulting in an
           empty directory being mounted on /app), the value is set to
           the empty string.

       <b>original-app-path </b>(string)
           If <b>flatpak run </b>was run with the <b>--app-path </b>option, this key
           gives the absolute path of the app's original files, as
           mounted at /run/parent/app inside the container. Available
           since 1.12.0.

           If this key is missing, the app files are given by <b>app-path</b>.

       <b>app-commit </b>(string)
           The commit ID of the application that is running. The
           filename of a deployment of this commit can be found in
           <b>original-app-path </b>if present, or <b>app-path </b>otherwise.

       <b>app-extensions </b>(list of strings)
           A list of app extensions that are mounted into the running
           instance. The format for each list item is
           <b>EXTENSION_ID=COMMIT</b>. If <b>original-app-path </b>is present, the
           extensions are mounted below /run/parent/app; otherwise, they
           are mounted below /app.

       <b>branch </b>(string)
           The branch of the app, for example stable. Available since
           0.6.10.

       <b>arch </b>(string)
           The architecture of the running instance.

       <b>flatpak-version </b>(string)
           The version number of the Flatpak version that ran this app.
           Available since 0.6.11.

       <b>runtime-path </b>(string)
           The absolute path on the host system of the app's runtime
           files, as mounted at /usr inside the container. Available
           since 0.6.10.

           Since 1.12.0, if <b>flatpak run </b>was run with the <b>--usr-path</b>
           option, this key gives the absolute path of whatever files
           were mounted on /usr, even if that differs from the app's
           normal runtime files.

       <b>original-runtime-path </b>(string)
           If <b>flatpak run </b>was run with the <b>--runtime-path </b>option, this
           key gives the absolute path of the app's original runtime, as
           mounted at /run/parent/usr inside the container. Available
           since 1.12.0.

           If this key is missing, the runtime files are given by
           <b>runtime-path</b>.

       <b>runtime-commit </b>(string)
           The commit ID of the runtime that is used. The filename of a
           deployment of this commit can be found in

           running instance. The format for each list item is
           <b>EXTENSION_ID=COMMIT</b>. If <b>original-app-path </b>is present, the
           extensions are mounted below /run/parent/usr; otherwise, they
           are mounted below /usr.

       <b>extra-args </b>(string)
           Extra arguments that were passed to flatpak run.

       <b>sandbox </b>(boolean)
           Whether the <b>--sandbox </b>option was passed to flatpak run.

       <b>build </b>(boolean)
           Whether this instance was created by flatpak build.

       <b>session-bus-proxy </b>(boolean)
           True if this app cannot access the D-Bus session bus directly
           (either it goes via a proxy, or it cannot access the session
           bus at all). Available since 0.8.0.

       <b>system-bus-proxy </b>(boolean)
           True if this app cannot access the D-Bus system bus directly
           (either it goes via a proxy, or it cannot access the system
           bus at all). Available since 0.8.0.

   <b>[Session Bus Policy]</b>
       If the <b>sockets </b>key is not allowing full access to the D-Bus
       session bus, then flatpak provides filtered access.

       The default policy for the session bus only allows the
       application to own its own application ID, its subnames and its
       own application id as a subname of "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2". For
       instance if the app is called "org.my.App", it can only own
       "org.my.App", "org.my.App.*" and
       "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.org.my.App". It is only allowed to talk
       to names matching those patterns, plus the bus itself
       (org.freedesktop.DBus) and the portal APIs (bus names of the form
       org.freedesktop.portal.*).

       Additionally the app is always allowed to reply to messages sent
       to it, and emit broadcast signals (but these will not reach other
       sandboxed apps unless they are allowed to talk to your app.

       If the [Session Bus Policy] group is present, it provides policy
       for session bus access.

       Each key in this group has the form of a D-Bus bus name or prefix
       thereof, for example <b>org.gnome.SessionManager </b>or
       <b>org.freedesktop.portal.*</b>

       The possible values for entry are, in increasing order or access:

       <b>none</b>
           The bus name or names in question is invisible to the
           application. Available since 0.2.

       <b>see</b>
           The bus name or names can be enumerated by the application.
           Available since 0.2.

       <b>talk</b>
           The application can send messages/ and receive replies and
           signals from the bus name or names. Available since 0.2.

       <b>own</b>
           The application can own the bus name or names (as well as all
           the above). Available since 0.2.

   <b>[System Bus Policy]</b>
       If the <b>sockets </b>key is not allowing full access to the D-Bus
       system bus, then flatpak does not make the system bus available
       unless the [System Bus Policy] group is present and provides a
       policy for filtered access. Available since 0.2.

       Entries in this group have the same form as for the [Session Bus
       Policy] group. However, the app has no permissions by default.

   <b>[Environment]</b>
       The [Environment] group specifies environment variables to set
       when running the application. Available since 0.3.

       Entries in this group have the form <b>VAR=VALUE </b>where <b>VAR </b>is the
       name of an environment variable to set.

       Note that environment variables can also be unset (removed from
       the environment) by listing them in the <b>unset-environment </b>entry
       of the [Context] group.

   <b>[Extension NAME]</b>
       Runtimes and applications can define extension points, which
       allow optional, additional runtimes to be mounted at a specified
       location inside the sandbox when they are present on the system.
       Typical uses for extension points include translations for
       applications, or debuginfo for sdks. The name of the extension
       point is specified as part of the group heading. Since 0.11.4,
       the name may optionally include a tag in the NAME in the name@tag
       ref syntax if you wish to use different configurations (eg,
       versions) of the same extension concurrently. The "tag" is
       effectively ignored, but is necessary in order to allow the same
       extension name to be specified more than once.

       <b>directory </b>(string)
           The relative path at which the extension will be mounted in
           the sandbox. If the extension point is for an application,
           the path is relative to /app, otherwise it is relative to
           /usr. This key is mandatory. Available since 0.1.

       <b>version </b>(string)
           The branch to use when looking for the extension. If this is
           not specified, it defaults to the branch of the application
           or runtime that the extension point is for. Available since
           0.4.1.

       <b>versions </b>(string)
           The branches to use when looking for the extension. If this
           is not specified, it defaults to the branch of the
           application or runtime that the extension point is for.
           Available since 0.9.1, and backported to the 0.8.x branch in
           0.8.4.

       <b>add-ld-path </b>(string)
           A path relative to the extension point directory that will be
           appended to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Available since 0.9.1, and
           backported to the 0.8.x branch in 0.8.3.

       <b>merge-dirs </b>(string)
           A list of relative paths of directories below the extension
           point directory that will be merged. Available since 0.9.1,
           and backported to the 0.8.x branch in 0.8.3.

       <b>download-if </b>(string)
           A condition that must be true for the extension to be
           auto-downloaded. As of 1.1.1 this supports multiple
           conditions separated by semi-colons.

           These are the supported conditions:

           <b>active-gl-driver</b>
               Is true if the name of the active GL driver matches the
               extension point basename. Available since 0.9.1, and
               backported to the 0.8.x branch in 0.8.3.

           <b>active-gtk-theme</b>
               Is true if the name of the current GTK theme (via
               org.gnome.desktop.interface GSetting) matches the
               extension point basename. Added 0.10.1.

           <b>have-intel-gpu</b>
               Is true if the i915 kernel module is loaded. Added
               0.10.1.

           <b>have-kernel-module-*</b>
               Is true if the suffix (case-sensitive) is found in
               /proc/modules. For example have-kernel-module-nvidia.
               Added 1.13.1.

           <b>on-xdg-desktop-*</b>
               Is true if the suffix (case-insensitively) is in the
               XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP env var. For example
               on-xdg-desktop-GNOME-classic. Added 1.1.1.

       <b>autoprune-unless </b>(string)
           A condition that must be false for the extension to be
           considered unused when pruning. For example, <b>flatpak</b>
           <b>uninstall --unused </b>and <b>flatpak update </b>use this information.
           The only currently recognized value is active-gl-driver,
           which is true if the name of the active GL driver matches the
           extension point basename. Available since 0.11.8.

       <b>enable-if </b>(string)
           A condition that must be true for the extension to be
           enabled. As of 1.1.1 this supports multiple conditions
           separated by semi-colons. See <b>download-if </b>for available
           conditions.

       <b>subdirectory-suffix </b>(string)
           A suffix that gets appended to the directory name. This is
           very useful when the extension point naming scheme is
           "reversed". For example, an extension point for GTK+ themes
           would be /usr/share/themes/$NAME/gtk-3.0, which could be
           achieved using subdirectory-suffix=gtk-3.0. Available since
           0.9.1, and backported to the 0.8.x branch in 0.8.3.

       <b>subdirectories </b>(boolean)
           If this key is set to true, then flatpak will look for
           extensions whose name is a prefix of the extension point
           name, and mount them at the corresponding name below the
           subdirectory. Available since 0.1.

       <b>no-autodownload </b>(boolean)
           Whether to automatically download extensions matching this
           extension point when updating or installing a 'related'
           application or runtime. Available since 0.6.7.

       <b>locale-subset </b>(boolean)
           If set, then the extensions are partially downloaded by
           default, based on the currently configured locales. This
           means that the extension contents should be a set of
           directories with the language code as name. Available since
           0.9.13 (and 0.6.6 for any extensions called *.Locale)

       <b>autodelete </b>(boolean)
           Whether to automatically delete extensions matching this
           extension point when deleting a 'related' application or
           runtime. Available since 0.6.7.

       <b>collection-id </b>(string)
           The ID of the collection that this extension point belongs
           to. If this is unspecified, it defaults to the collection ID
           of the application or runtime that the extension point is
           for. Currently, extension points must be in the same
           collection as the application or runtime that they are for.
           Available since 0.99.1.

   <b>[ExtensionOf]</b>
       This optional group may be present if the runtime is an
       extension.

       <b>ref </b>(string)
           The ref of the runtime or application that this extension
           belongs to. Available since 0.9.1.

       <b>runtime </b>(string)
           The runtime this extension will be inside of. If it is an app
           extension, this is the app's runtime; otherwise, this is
           identical to ref, without the runtime/ prefix. Available
           since 1.5.0.

       <b>priority </b>(integer)
           The priority to give this extension when looking for the best
           match. Default is 0. Available since 0.9.1, and backported to
           the 0.8.x branch in 0.8.3.

       <b>tag </b>(string)
           The tag name to use when searching for this extension's mount
           point in the parent flatpak. Available since 0.11.4.

   <b>[Extra Data]</b>
       This optional group may be present if the runtime or application
       uses extra data that gets downloaded separately. The data in this
       group gets merged into the repository summary, with the
       xa.extra-data-sources key.

       If multiple extra data sources are present, their uri, size and
       checksum keys are grouped together by using the same suffix. If
       only one extra data source is present, the suffix can be omitted.

       <b>NoRuntime </b>(boolean)
           Whether to mount the runtime while running the
           /app/bin/apply_extra script. Defaults to true, i.e. not
           mounting the runtime. Available since 0.9.1, and backported
           to the 0.8.x branch in 0.8.4.

       <b>uri</b><i>X</i> (string)
           The uri for extra data source <i>X</i>. The only supported uri
           schemes are http and https. Available since 0.6.13.

       <b>size</b><i>X</i> (integer)
           The size for extra data source <i>X</i>. Available since 0.6.13.

       <b>checksum</b><i>X</i> (string)
           The sha256 sum for extra data source <i>X</i>. Available since
           0.6.13.

   <b>[Policy SUBSYSTEM]</b>
       Subsystems can define their own policies to be placed in a group
       whose name has this form. Their values are treated as lists, in
       which items can have their meaning negated by prepending ! to the
       value. They are not otherwise parsed by Flatpak. Available since
       0.6.13.
