NAME </h2>

</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="yum-torrent.conf.5.html">yum-torrent.conf(5)</a> is the configuration file for <a href="../man1/yum-torrent.1.html">yum-torrent(1)</a>
       Yum plugin to download and seed packages via BitTorrent.  This
       configuration specifies which BitTorrent client to use, how to
       interact with it, and a number of timing parameters.  Of
       particular note is the <b>{seed_time} </b>substitution.  The benefit of
       using BitTorrent is partially attributable to clients contining
       to seed their torrents some time after they have completed their
       download.  <a href="../man1/yum-torrent.1.html">yum-torrent(1)</a> employs an exponential decay algorithm
       seeded from the hostname and torrent info_hash.  All clients will
       seed for at least <b>seed_min </b>After that, the number of seeders will
       decay as the probability of other hosts also needing the same set
       of packages will also decrease.

[main] OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>service</b>
              A specific relative path on the http repository where the
              <a href="../man8/pkgtorrent-service.8.html">pkgtorrent-service(8)</a> is configured. See also
              <a href="pkgtorrent-service.conf.5.html">pkgtorrent-service.conf(5)</a> for more. Defaults to
              <b>/yum/torrent_service</b>

       <b>client </b>Fully qualified path to BitTorrent client that accepts a
              single positional torrent filename that will download into
              the current working directory.  Required.

       <b>options</b>
              Additional command line parameters passed to <b>client </b>on
              startup.  A substitution named <b>{seed_time} </b>is available.
              This is measured in seconds and can be used to instruct
              the BitTorrent client to seed for a variable time once the
              download is completed.

       <b>complete</b>
              The text to match anywhere from the logged stdout of the
              <b>client </b>signaling the package files have been downloaded.
              This allows the client to continue to run and seed the
              torrent file for others.
</pre> <h2>
[timeouts] OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       All the values in this section are positive integers measured in
       seconds.

       <b>download</b>
              The maximum time to wait for the message <b>complete </b>to
              appear in the log file.  If a download with the plugin
              fails for any reason <b>yum </b>will not find the downloaded rpm
              files in <b>/var/cache/yum </b>directory. It will fall back on
              the internal download mechanism.

       <b>seed_min</b>
              The minimum value for <b>{seed_time}</b>. Default 900 (15
              minutes).  It is recommended you set this to the same time
              as your configuration management interval.

       <b>seed_max</b>
              The maximum value for <b>{seed_time}</b>. Default 86400 (1 day).

       <b>nullfile</b>
              Delete the padding nullfiles after this time period.

       <b>cache  </b>At the end of each run, <b>/var/cache/yum_torrent </b>is
              examined. Any files not touched in this time period are
              deleted, and empty directories are removed.  Note: If yum
              is not run for an extended period, this garbage collection
              will not happen.
