NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-split - Debian multi-part binary package format
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>filename</i><b>.deb</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The multi-part <b>.deb </b>format is used to split big packages into
       smaller pieces to ease transport in small media.
</pre> <h2>
FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The file is an <b>ar </b>archive with a magic value of <b>!&lt;arch&gt;</b>.  The
       file names might contain a trailing slash (since dpkg 1.15.6).

       The first member is named <b>debian-split </b>and contains a series of
       lines, separated by newlines.  Currently eight lines are present:

       •   The format version number, <b>2.1 </b>at the time this manual page
           was written.

       •   The package name.

       •   The package version.

       •   The md5sum of the package.

       •   The total size of the package.

       •   The maximum part size.

       •   The current part number, followed by a slash and the total
           amount of parts (as in ‘1/10’).

       •   The package architecture (since dpkg 1.16.1).

       Programs which read multi-part archives should be prepared for
       the minor format version number to be increased and additional
       lines to be present, and should ignore these if this is the case.

       If the major format version number has changed, an incompatible
       change has been made and the program should stop.  If it has not,
       then the program should be able to safely continue, unless it
       encounters an unexpected member in the archive (except at the
       end), as described below.

       The second, last required member is named <b>data.</b><i>N</i>, where <i>N</i> denotes
       the part number.  It contains the raw part data.

       These members must occur in this exact order.  Current
       implementations should ignore any additional members after
       <b>data.</b><i>N</i>.  Further members may be defined in the future, and (if
       possible) will be placed after these two.
