</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ltrace.conf </b>- Configuration file for <a href="../man1/ltrace.1.html">ltrace(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page describes <b>ltrace.conf</b>, a file that describes
       prototypes of functions in binaries for <a href="../man1/ltrace.1.html">ltrace(1)</a> to use.  Ltrace
       needs this information to display function call arguments.

       Each line of a configuration file describes at most a single
       item.  Lines composed entirely of white space are ignored, as are
       lines starting with semicolon or hash characters (comment lines).
       Described items can be either function prototypes, or definitions
       of type aliases.
</pre> <h2>
PROTOTYPES </h2>
<pre>
       A prototype describes return type and parameter types of a single
       function.  The syntax is as follows:

              [<b>function</b>] <i>LENS NAME</i> <b>(</b>[<i>LENS</i>{,<i>LENS</i>}]<b>);</b>

       <i>NAME</i> is the (mangled) name of a symbol.  In the elementary case,
       <i>LENS</i> is simply a type.  Both lenses and types are described
       below.  The <b>function </b>keyword, if present, has no effect.  It can
       be used to force a line to be interpreted as a function prototype
       when the return type is a keyword that would start a different
       type of line (such as <b>import</b>).

       For example, a simple function prototype might look like this:

              <b>int </b>kill<b>(int,int);</b>

       Despite the apparent similarity with C, <b>ltrace.conf </b>is really its
       own language that's only somewhat inspired by C.
</pre> <h2>
TYPES </h2>
<pre>
       Ltrace understands a range of primitive types.  Those are
       interpreted according to C convention native on a given
       architecture.  E.g. <b>ulong </b>is interpreted as 4-byte unsigned
       integer on 32-bit GNU/Linux machine, but 8-byte unsigned integer
       on 64-bit GNU/Linux machine.

       <b>void   </b>Denotes that a function does not return anything.  Can be
              also used to construct a generic pointer, i.e. pointer-
              sized number formatted in hexadecimal format.

       <b>char   </b>8-bit quantity rendered as a character

       <b>ushort,short</b>
              Denotes unsigned or signed short integer.

       <b>uint,int</b>
              Denotes unsigned or signed integer.

       <b>ulong,long</b>
              Denotes unsigned or signed long integer.

       <b>float  </b>Denotes floating point number with single precision.

       <b>double </b>Denotes floating point number with double precision.

       Besides primitive types, the following composed types are
       possible:

       <b>struct(</b>[<i>LENS</i>{,<i>LENS</i>}]<b>)</b>
              Describes a structure with given types as fields, e.g.
              <b>struct(int,int,float)</b>.

              Alignment is computed as customary on the architecture.
              Custom alignment (e.g. packed structs) and bit-fields are
              not supported.  It's also not possible to differentiate
              between structs and non-POD C++ classes, for arches where
              it makes a difference.

       <b>array(</b><i>LENS</i><b>,</b><i>EXPR</i><b>)</b>
              Describes array of length <i>EXPR</i>, which is composed of types
              described by <i>LENS</i>, e.g. <b>array(int, </b>6<b>)</b>.

              Note that in C, arrays in role of function argument decay
              into pointers.  Ltrace currently handles this
              automatically, but for full formal correctness, any such
              arguments should be described as pointers to arrays.

       <i>LENS</i><b>*  </b>Describes a pointer to a given type, e.g. <b>char* </b>or <b>int***</b>.
              Note that the former example actually describes a pointer
              to a character, not a string.  See below for <b>string </b>lens,
              which is applicable to these cases.
</pre> <h2>
LENSES </h2>
<pre>
       Lenses change the way that types are described.  In the simplest
       case, a lens is directly a type.  Otherwise a type is decorated
       by the lens.  Ltrace understands the following lenses:

       <b>oct(</b><i>TYPE</i><b>)</b>
              The argument, which should be an integer type, is
              formatted in base-8.

       <b>hex(</b><i>TYPE</i><b>)</b>
              The argument, which should be an integer or floating point
              type, is formatted in base-16.  Floating point arguments
              are converted to double and then displayed using the <b>%a</b>
              fprintf modifier.

       <b>hide(</b><i>TYPE</i><b>)</b>
              The argument is not shown in argument list.

       <b>bool(</b><i>TYPE</i><b>)</b>
              Arguments with zero value are shown as "false", others are
              shown as "true".

       <b>bitvec(</b><i>TYPE</i><b>)</b>
              Underlying argument is interpreted as a bit vector and a
              summary of bits set in the vector is displayed.  For
              example if bits 3,4,5 and 7 of the bit vector are set,
              ltrace shows &lt;3-5,7&gt;.  Empty bit vector is displayed as
              &lt;&gt;.  If there are more bits set than unset, inverse is
              shown instead: e.g. ~&lt;0&gt; when a number 0xfffffffe is
              displayed.  Full set is thus displayed ~&lt;&gt;.

              If the underlying type is integral, then bits are shown in
              their natural big-endian order, with LSB being bit 0.
              E.g. <b>bitvec(ushort) </b>with value 0x0102 would be displayed
              as &lt;1,8&gt;, irrespective of underlying byte order.

              For other data types (notably structures and arrays), the
              underlying data is interpreted byte after byte.  Bit 0 of
              first byte has number 0, bit 0 of second byte number 8,
              and so on.  Thus <b>bitvec(struct(int)) </b>is endian sensitive,
              and will show bytes comprising the integer in their memory
              order.  Pointers are first dereferenced, thus
              <b>bitvec(array(char, </b>32<b>)*) </b>is actually a pointer to 256-bit
              bit vector.

       <b>string(</b><i>TYPE</i><b>)</b>
       <b>string[</b><i>EXPR</i><b>]</b>
       <b>string</b>
              The first form of the argument is canonical, the latter
              two are syntactic sugar.  In the canonical form, the
              function argument is formatted as string.  The <i>TYPE</i> can
              have either of the following forms: <i>X</i><b>*</b>, or <b>array(</b><i>X</i><b>,</b><i>EXPR</i><b>)</b>,
              or <b>array(</b><i>X</i><b>,</b><i>EXPR</i><b>)*</b>.  <i>X</i> is either <b>char </b>for normal strings,
              or an integer type for wide-character strings.

              If an array is given, the length will typically be a <b>zero</b>
              expression (but doesn't have to be).  Using argument that
              is plain array (i.e. not a pointer to array) makes sense
              e.g. in C structs, in cases like <b>struct(string(array(char,</b>
              6<b>)))</b>, which describes the C type <b>struct {char </b>s<b>[</b>6<b>];}</b>.

              Because simple C-like strings are pretty common, there are
              two shorthand forms.  The first shorthand form (with
              brackets) means the same as <b>string(array(char, </b><i>EXPR</i><b>)*)</b>.
              Plain <b>string </b>without an argument is then taken to mean the
              same as <b>string[zero]</b>.

              Note that <b>char* </b>by itself describes a pointer to a char.
              Ltrace will dereference the pointer, and read and display
              the single character that it points to.

       <b>enum(</b><i>NAME</i>[<b>=</b><i>VALUE</i>]{,<i>NAME</i>[<b>=</b><i>VALUE</i>]}<b>)</b>
       <b>enum[</b><i>TYPE</i><b>](</b><i>NAME</i>[<b>=</b><i>VALUE</i>]{,<i>NAME</i>[<b>=</b><i>VALUE</i>]}<b>)</b>
              This describes an enumeration lens.  If an argument has
              any of the given values, it is instead shown as the
              corresponding <i>NAME</i>.  If a <i>VALUE</i> is omitted, the next
              consecutive value following after the previous <i>VALUE</i> is
              taken instead.  If the first <i>VALUE</i> is omitted, it's <b>0 </b>by
              default.

              <i>TYPE</i>, if given, is the underlying type.  It is thus
              possible to create enums over shorts or longs—arguments
              that are themselves plain, non-enum types in C, but whose
              values can be meaningfully described as enumerations.  If
              omitted, <i>TYPE</i> is taken to be <b>int</b>.
</pre> <h2>
TYPE ALIASES </h2>
<pre>
       A line in config file can, instead of describing a prototype,
       create a type alias.  Instead of writing the same enum or struct
       on many places (and possibly updating when it changes), one can
       introduce a name for such type, and later just use that name:

              <b>typedef </b><i>NAME</i> <b>= </b><i>LENS</i><b>;</b>
</pre> <h2>
IMPORT DIRECTIVES </h2>
<pre>
       It's possible for config files to import definitions from other
       config files.  A line of the form:

              <b>import "</b><i>FILENAME</i><b>";</b>

       will make all definitions from <i>FILENAME</i>.conf available in the
       current file.  The imported file is searched for in the same
       directories as when looking up a config file corresponding to a
       library; see <a href="../man1/ltrace.1.html">ltrace(1)</a> for details.
</pre> <h2>
RECURSIVE STRUCTURES </h2>
<pre>
       Ltrace allows you to express recursive structures.  Such
       structures are expanded to the depth described by the parameter
       -A.  To declare a recursive type, you first have to introduce the
       type to ltrace by using forward declaration.  Then you can use
       the type in other type definitions in the usual way:

              <b>typedef </b><i>NAME</i> <b>= struct;</b>
              <b>typedef </b><i>NAME</i> <b>= struct(</b><i>NAME</i> can be used here<b>)</b>

       For example, consider the following singy-linked structure and a
       function that takes such list as an argument:

              <b>typedef </b>int_list <b>= struct;</b>
              <b>typedef </b>int_list <b>= struct(int, </b>int_list<b>*);</b>
              <b>void </b>ll<b>(</b>int_list<b>*);</b>

       Such declarations might lead to an output like the following:

              ll({ 9, { 8, { 7, { 6, ... } } } }) = &lt;void&gt;

       Ltrace detects recursion and will not expand already-expanded
       structures.  Thus a doubly-linked list would look like the
       following:

              <b>typedef </b>int_list <b>= struct;</b>
              <b>typedef </b>int_list <b>= struct(int, </b>int_list<b>*, </b>int_list<b>*);</b>

       With output e.g. like:

              ll({ 9, { 8, { 7, { 6, ..., ... }, recurse^ }, recurse^ },
              nil })

       The "recurse^" tokens mean that given pointer points to a
       structure that was expanded in the previous layer.  Simple
       "recurse" would mean that it points back to this object.  E.g.
       "recurse^^^" means it points to a structure three layers up.  For
       doubly-linked list, the pointer to the previous element is of
       course the one that has been just expanded in the previous round,
       and therefore all of them are either recurse^, or nil.  If the
       next and previous pointers are swapped, the output adjusts
       correspondingly:

              ll({ 9, nil, { 8, recurse^, { 7, recurse^, { 6, ..., ... }
              } } })
</pre> <h2>
EXPRESSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Ltrace has support for some elementary expressions.  Each
       expression can be either of the following:

       <i>NUM</i>    An integer number.

       <b>arg</b><i>NUM</i> Value of <i>NUM</i>-th argument.  The expression has the same
              value as the corresponding argument.  <b>arg1 </b>refers to the
              first argument, <b>arg0 </b>to the return value of the given
              function.

       <b>retval </b>Return value of function, same as <b>arg0</b>.

       <b>elt</b><i>NUM</i> Value of <i>NUM</i>-th element of the surrounding structure type.
              E.g.  <b>struct(ulong,array(int,elt1)) </b>describes a structure
              whose first element is a length, and second element an
              array of ints of that length.

       <b>zero</b>
       <b>zero(</b><i>EXPR</i><b>)</b>
              Describes array which extends until the first element,
              whose each byte is 0.  If an expression is given, that is
              the maximum length of the array.  If NUL terminator is not
              found earlier, that's where the array ends.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETER PACKS </h2>
<pre>
       Sometimes the actual function prototype varies slightly depending
       on the exact parameters given.  For example, the number and types
       of printf parameters are not known in advance, but ltrace might
       be able to determine them in runtime.  This feature has wider
       applicability, but currently the only parameter pack that ltrace
       supports is printf-style format string itself:

       <b>format </b>When <b>format </b>is seen in the parameter list, the underlying
              string argument is parsed, and GNU-style format specifiers
              are used to determine what the following actual arguments
              are.  E.g. if the format string is "%s %d\n", it's as if
              the <b>format </b>was replaced by <b>string, string, int</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       C functions often use one or more arguments for returning values
       back to the caller.  The caller provides a pointer to storage,
       which the called function initializes.  Ltrace has some support
       for this idiom.

       When a traced binary hits a function call, ltrace first fetches
       all arguments.  It then displays <i>left</i> portion of the argument
       list.  Only when the function returns does ltrace display <i>right</i>
       portion as well.  Typically, left portion takes up all the
       arguments, and right portion only contains return value.  But
       ltrace allows you to configure where exactly to put the dividing
       line by means of a <b>+ </b>operator placed in front of an argument:

              <b>int </b>asprintf<b>(+string*, format);</b>

       Here, the first argument to asprintf is denoted as return
       argument, which means that displaying the whole argument list is
       delayed until the function returns:

              a.out-&gt;asprintf( &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
              libc.so.6-&gt;malloc(100)                   = 0x245b010
              [... more calls here ...]
              &lt;... asprintf resumed&gt; "X=1", "X=%d", 1) = 5

       It is currently not possible to have an "inout" argument that
       passes information in both directions.
</pre> <h2>

       In the following, the first is the C prototype, and following
       that is ltrace configuration line.
