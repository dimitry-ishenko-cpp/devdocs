DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cmdline</i>
              This read-only file holds the complete command line for
              the process, unless the process is a zombie.  In the
              latter case, there is nothing in this file: that is, a
              read on this file will return 0 characters.

              For processes which are still running, the command-line
              arguments appear in this file in the same layout as they
              do in process memory: If the process is well-behaved, it
              is a set of strings separated by null bytes ('\0'), with a
              further null byte after the last string.

              This is the common case, but processes have the freedom to
              override the memory region and break assumptions about the
              contents or format of the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cmdline</i> file.

              If, after an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, the process modifies its <i>argv</i>
              strings, those changes will show up here.  This is not the
              same thing as modifying the <i>argv</i> array.

              Furthermore, a process may change the memory location that
              this file refers via <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> operations such as
              <b>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</b>.

              Think of this file as the command line that the process
              wants you to see.
