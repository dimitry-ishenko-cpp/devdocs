</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ausearch-expression - audit search expression format
</pre> <h2>
OVERVIEW </h2>
<pre>
       This man page describes the format of "ausearch expressions".
       Parsing and evaluation of these expressions is provided by
       libauparse and is common to applications that use this library.
</pre> <h2>
LEXICAL STRUCTURE </h2>
<pre>
       White space (ASCII space, tab and new-line characters) between
       tokens is ignored.  The following tokens are recognized:

       Punctuation
              <b>( ) \</b>

       Logical operators
              <b>! &amp;&amp; ||</b>

       Comparison operators
              <b>&lt; &lt;= == &gt; &gt;= !== i= i!= r= r!=</b>

       Unquoted strings
              Any non-empty sequence of ASCII letters, digits, and the <b>_</b>
              symbol.

       Quoted strings
              A sequence of characters surrounded by the <b>" </b>quotes.  The
              <b>\ </b>character starts an escape sequence.  The only defined
              escape sequences are <b>\\ </b>and <b>\"</b>.  The semantics of other
              escape sequences is undefined.

       Regexps
              A sequence of characters surrounded by the <b>/ </b>characters.
              The <b>\ </b>character starts an escape sequence.  The only
              defined escape sequences are <b>\\ </b>and <b>\/</b>.  The semantics of
              other escape sequences is undefined.

       Anywhere an unquoted string is valid, a quoted string is valid as
       well, and vice versa.  In particular, field names may be
       specified using quoted strings, and field values may be specified
       using unquoted strings.
</pre> <h2>
EXPRESSION SYNTAX </h2>
<pre>
       The primary expression has one of the following forms:

              <i>field comparison-operator value</i>

              <b>\regexp </b><i>string-or-regexp</i>

       <i>field</i> is either a string, which specifies the first field with
       that name within the current audit record, or the <b>\ </b>escape
       character followed by a string, which specifies a virtual field
       with the specified name (virtual fields are defined in a later
       section).

       <i>field</i> is a string.  <i>operator</i> specifies the comparison to perform

       <b>r= r!= </b>Get the "raw" string of <i>field</i>, and compare it to <i>value</i>.
              For fields in audit records, the "raw" string is the exact
              string stored in the audit record (with all escaping and
              unprintable character encoding left alone); applications
              can read the "raw" string using <a href="../man3/auparse_get_field_str.3.html">auparse_get_field_str(3)</a>.
              Each virtual field may define a "raw" string.  If <i>field</i> is
              not present or does not define a "raw" string, the result
              of the comparison is <b>false </b>(regardless of the operator).

       <b>i= i!= </b>Get the "interpreted" string of <i>field</i>, and compare it to
              <i>value</i>.  For fields in audit records, the "interpreted"
              string is an "user-readable" interpretation of the field
              value; applications can read the "interpreted" string
              using <a href="../man3/auparse_interpret_field.3.html">auparse_interpret_field(3)</a>.  Each virtual field may
              define an "interpreted" string.  If <i>field</i> is not present
              or does not define an "interpreted" string, the result of
              the comparison is <b>false </b>(regardless of the operator).

       <b>&lt; &lt;= == &gt; &gt;= !==</b>
              Evaluate the "value" of <i>field</i>, and compare it to <i>value</i>.  A
              "value" may be defined for any field or virtual field, but
              no "value" is currently defined for any audit record
              field.  The rules of parsing <i>value</i> for comparing it with
              the "value" of <i>field</i> are specific for each <i>field</i>.  If
              <i>field</i> is not present, the result of the comparison is
              <b>false </b>(regardless of the operator).  If <i>field</i> does not
              define a "value", an error is reported when parsing the
              expression.

       In the special case of <b>\regexp </b><i>regexp-or-string</i>, the current
       audit record is taken as a string (without interpreting field
       values), and matched against <i>regexp-or-string</i>.  <i>regexp-or-string</i>
       is an extended regular expression, using a string or regexp token
       (in other words, delimited by <b>" </b>or <b>/</b>).

       If <i>E1</i> and <i>E2</i> are valid expressions, then <b>!  </b><i>E1</i>, <i>E1</i> <b>&amp;&amp; </b><i>E2</i>, and <i>E1</i>
       <b>|| </b><i>E2</i> are valid expressions as well, with the usual C semantics
       and evaluation priorities.  Note that <b>!  </b><i>field op value</i> is
       interpreted as <b>!(</b><i>field op value</i><b>)</b>, not as <b>(!</b><i>field</i><b>) </b><i>op value</i>.
</pre> <h2>
VIRTUAL FIELDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following virtual fields are defined:

       <b>\timestamp</b>
              The value is the timestamp of the current event.  <i>value</i>
              must be formatted as:

                   ts:seconds.milli

              where <i>seconds</i> and <i>milli</i> are decimal numbers specifying the
              seconds   and   milliseconds   part   of   the  timestamp,
              respectively.

       <b>\timestamp_ex</b>
              This is similar to <b>\timestamp </b>but also includes the
              event's serial number.  <i>value</i> must be formatted as:

                   ts:seconds.milli:serial

              where <i>serial</i> is a decimal number  specifying  the  event's
              serial number.

       <b>\record_type</b>
              The value is the type of the current record.  <i>value</i> is
              either the record type name, or a decimal number
              specifying the type.
</pre> <h2>
SEMANTICS </h2>
<pre>
       The expression as a whole applies to a single record.  The
       expression is <b>true </b>for a specified event if it is <b>true </b>for any
       record associated with the event.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       As a demonstration of the semantics of handling missing fields,
       the following expression is <b>true </b>if <i>field</i> is present:

              <b>(</b><i>field</i> <b>r= "") || (</b><i>field</i> <b>r!= "")</b>

       and the same expression surrounded by <b>!( </b>and <b>) </b>is <b>true </b>if <i>field</i>
       is not present.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       New escape sequences for quoted strings may be defined.

       For currently defined virtual fields that do not define a "raw"
       or "interpreted" string, the definition may be added.  Therefore,
       don't rely on the fact that comparing the "raw" or "interpreted"
       string of the field with any value is <b>false</b>.

       New formats of value constants for the <b>\timestamp </b>virtual field
       may be added.
