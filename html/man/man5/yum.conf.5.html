</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       yum.conf - redirecting to DNF Configuration Reference
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>DNF</i> by default uses the global configuration file at
       <b>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf </b>and all *.repo files found under
       <b>/etc/yum.repos.d</b>. The latter is typically used for repository
       configuration and takes precedence over global configuration.

       The configuration file has INI format consisting of section
       declaration and <b>name=value </b>options below each on separate line.
       There are two types of sections in the configuration files: main
       and repository. Main section defines all global configuration
       options and should be only one.

       The repository sections define the configuration for each (remote
       or local) repository. The section name of the repository in
       brackets serve as repo ID reference and should be unique across
       configuration files. The allowed characters of repo ID string are
       lower and upper case alphabetic letters, digits, <b>-</b>, <b>_</b>, <b>.  </b>and <b>:</b>.
       The minimal repository configuration file should aside from repo
       ID consists of <i>baseurl</i>, <i>metalink</i> or <i>mirrorlist</i> option definition.
</pre> <h2>
DISTRIBUTION-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Configuration options, namely <i>best</i> and <i>skip_if_unavailable</i>, can
       be set in the DNF configuration file by your distribution to
       override the DNF defaults.
</pre> <h2>
[MAIN] OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>allow_vendor_change</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              If disabled dnf will stick to vendor when upgrading or
              downgrading rpms.  Default is <b>True</b>

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This option is currently not supported for <i>downgrade</i>
                 and <i>distro-sync</i> commands

       <b>arch   </b><i>string</i>

              The architecture used for installing packages. By default
              this is auto-detected. Often used together with <i>ignorearch</i>
              option.

       <b>assumeno</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              If enabled dnf will assume <b>No </b>where it would normally
              prompt for confirmation from user input. Default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>assumeyes</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              If enabled dnf will assume <b>Yes </b>where it would normally
              prompt for confirmation from user input (see also
              <i>defaultyes</i>). Default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>autocheck_running_kernel</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Automatic check whether there is installed newer kernel
              module with security update than currently running kernel.
              Default is <b>True</b>.

       <b>basearch</b>
              <i>string</i>

              The base architecture used for installing packages. By
              default this is auto-detected.

       <b>best   </b><i>boolean</i>

              <b>True </b>instructs the solver to either use a package with the
              highest available version or fail. On <b>False</b>, do not fail
              if the latest version cannot be installed and go with the
              lower version. The default is <b>False</b>.  Note this option in
              particular <i>can be set in your configuration file by your</i>
              <i>distribution</i>. Also note that the use of the highest
              available version is only guaranteed for the packages
              directly requested and not for their dependencies.

       <b>cachedir</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Path to a directory used by various DNF subsystems for
              storing cache data.  Has a reasonable root-writable
              default depending on the distribution. DNF needs to be
              able to create files and directories at this location.

       <b>cacheonly</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              If set to <b>True </b>DNF will run entirely from system cache,
              will not update the cache and will use it even in case it
              is expired. Default is <b>False</b>.

              API Notes: Must be set before repository objects are
              created. Plugins must set this in the pre_config hook.
              Later changes are ignored.

       <b>check_config_file_age</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Specifies whether dnf should automatically expire metadata
              of repos, which are older than their corresponding
              configuration file (usually the dnf.conf file and the
              foo.repo file).  Default is <b>True </b>(perform the check).
              Expire of metadata is also affected by metadata age.  See
              also <i>metadata_expire</i>.

       <b>clean_requirements_on_remove</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Remove dependencies that are no longer used during <b>dnf</b>
              <b>remove</b>. A package only qualifies for removal via
              <b>clean_requirements_on_remove </b>if it was installed through
              DNF but not on explicit user request, i.e. it was pulled
              in as a dependency. The default is True.  (<i>installonlypkgs</i>
              are never automatically removed.)

       <b>config_file_path</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Path to the default main configuration file. Default is
              <b>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</b>.

       <b>debuglevel</b>
              <i>integer</i>

              Debug messages output level, in the range 0 to 10. The
              higher the number the more debug output is put to stdout.
              Default is 2.

       <b>debug_solver</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Controls whether the libsolv debug files should be created
              when solving the transaction. The debug files are created
              in the <i>./debugdata</i> directory.  Default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>defaultyes</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              If enabled the default answer to user confirmation prompts
              will be <b>Yes</b>. Not to be confused with <i>assumeyes</i> which will
              not prompt at all. Default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>diskspacecheck</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Controls whether rpm should check available disk space
              during the transaction.  Default is <b>True</b>.

       <b>errorlevel</b>
              <i>integer</i>

              Error messages output level, in the range 0 to 10. The
              higher the number the more error output is put to stderr.
              Default is 3. This is deprecated in DNF and overwritten by
              -<i>-verbose</i> commandline option.

       <b>exclude_from_weak</b>
              <i>list</i>

              Prevent installing packages as weak dependencies
              (recommends or supplements). The packages can be specified
              by a name or a glob and separated by a comma. Defaults to
              <b>[]</b>.

       <b>exclude_from_weak_autodetect</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              If enabled, dnf will autodetect unmet weak dependencies
              (recommends or supplements) of packages installed on the
              system. Providers of these weak dependencies will not be
              installed by dnf as weak dependencies any more (they will
              still be installed if pulled in as a regular dependency).
              Defaults to <b>true</b>.

       <b>exit_on_lock</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Should the dnf client exit immediately when something else
              has the lock. Default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>gpgkey_dns_verification</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Should the dnf attempt to automatically verify GPG
              verification keys using the DNS system. This option
              requires the unbound python module (python3-unbound) to be
              installed on the client system. This system has two main
              features. The first one is to check if any of the already
              installed keys have been revoked. Automatic removal of the
              key is not yet available, so it is up to the user, to
              remove revoked keys from the system. The second feature is
              automatic verification of new keys when a repository is
              added to the system. In interactive mode, the result is
              written to the output as a suggestion to the user. In
              non-interactive mode (i.e. when -y is used), this system
              will automatically accept keys that are available in the
              DNS and are correctly signed using DNSSEC. It will also
              accept keys that do not exist in the DNS system and their
              NON-existence is cryptographically proven using DNSSEC.
              This is mainly to preserve backward compatibility.
              Default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>group_package_types</b>
              <i>list</i>

              List of the following: optional, default, mandatory. Tells
              dnf which type of packages in groups will be installed
              when 'groupinstall' is called. Default is: <b>default,</b>
              <b>mandatory</b>.

       <b>ignorearch</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              If set to <b>True</b>, RPM will allow attempts to install
              packages incompatible with the CPU's architecture.
              Defaults to <b>False</b>. Often used together with <i>arch</i> option.

       <b>installonlypkgs</b>
              <i>list</i>

              List of provide names of packages that should only ever be
              installed, never upgraded. Kernels in particular fall into
              this category.  These packages are never removed by <b>dnf</b>
              <b>autoremove </b>even if they were installed as dependencies
              (see <i>clean_requirements_on_remove</i> for auto removal
              details).  This option append the list values to the
              default installonlypkgs list used by DNF. The number of
              kept package versions is regulated by <i>installonly_limit</i>.

       <b>installonly_limit</b>
              <i>integer</i>

              Number of <i>installonly packages</i> allowed to be installed
              concurrently. Defaults to 3. The minimal number of
              installonly packages is 2. Value 0 means unlimited number
              of installonly packages. Value 1 is explicitly not allowed
              since it complicates kernel upgrades due to protection of
              the running kernel from removal.

       <b>installroot</b>
              <i>string</i>

              The root of the filesystem for all packaging operations.
              It requires an absolute path. See also <i>--installroot</i>
              <i>commandline option</i>.

       <b>install_weak_deps</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              When this option is set to True and a new package is about
              to be installed, all packages linked by weak dependency
              relation (Recommends or Supplements flags) with this
              package will be pulled into the transaction.  Default is
              <b>True</b>.

       <b>keepcache</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Keeps downloaded packages in the cache when set to True.
              Even if it is set to False and packages have not been
              installed they will still persist until next successful
              transaction. The default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>logdir </b><i>string</i>

              Directory where the log files will be stored. Default is
              <b>/var/log</b>.

       <b>logfilelevel</b>
              <i>integer</i>

              Log file messages output level, in the range 0 to 10. The
              higher the number the more debug output is put to logs.
              Default is 9.

              This option controls dnf.log, dnf.librepo.log and
              hawkey.log. Although dnf.librepo.log and hawkey.log are
              affected only by setting the logfilelevel to 10.

       <b>log_compress</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              When set to <b>True</b>, log files are compressed when they are
              rotated. Default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>log_rotate</b>
              <i>integer</i>

              Log files are rotated <b>log_rotate </b>times before being
              removed. If <b>log_rotate </b>is <b>0</b>, the rotation is not
              performed.  Default is <b>4</b>.

       <b>log_size</b>
              storage size

              Log  files are rotated when they grow bigger than log_size
              bytes. If log_size is 0, the rotation is not performed.
              The default is 1 MB. Valid units are 'k', 'M', 'G'.

              The size applies for individual log files, not the sum of
              all log files.  See also <i>log_rotate</i>.

       <b>metadata_timer_sync</b>
              time in seconds

              The minimal period between two consecutive <b>makecache timer</b>
              runs. The command will stop immediately if it's less than
              this time period since its last run. Does not affect
              simple <b>makecache </b>run. Use <b>0 </b>to completely disable
              automatic metadata synchronizing. The default corresponds
              to three hours. The value is rounded to the next commenced
              hour.

       <b>module_obsoletes</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              This option controls whether dnf should apply modular
              obsoletes when possible. Default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>module_platform_id</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Set this to $name:$stream to override PLATFORM_ID detected
              from <b>/etc/os-release</b>.  It is necessary to perform a system
              upgrade and switch to a new platform.

       <b>module_stream_switch</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              This option controls whether it's possible to switch
              enabled streams of a module. Default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>multilib_policy</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Controls how multilib packages are treated during install
              operations. Can either be <b>"best" </b>(the default) for the
              depsolver to prefer packages which best match the system's
              architecture, or <b>"all" </b>to install packages for all
              available architectures.

       <b>obsoletes</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              This option only has affect during an install/update. It
              enables dnf's obsoletes processing logic, which means it
              makes dnf check whether any dependencies of given package
              are no longer required and removes them.  Useful when
              doing distribution level upgrades.  Default is 'true'.

              Command-line option: <i>--obsoletes</i>

       <b>optional_metadata_types</b>
              <i>list</i>

              List of metadata types to be loaded in addition to
              <b>primary</b>, <b>modules</b>, <b>comps</b>, <b>updateinfo </b>and <b>presto</b>, which are
              loaded always.

              Note that the list can be extended by individual commands
              to explicitly request loading specific metadata type.

              Currently only <b>filelists </b>value is supported. Default is an
              empty list.

       <b>persistdir</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Directory where DNF stores its persistent data between
              runs. Default is <b>"/var/lib/dnf"</b>.

       <b>pluginconfpath</b>
              <i>list</i>

              List of directories that are searched for plugin
              configurations to load. All configuration files found in
              these directories, that are named same as a plugin, are
              parsed. The default path is <b>/etc/dnf/plugins</b>.

       <b>pluginpath</b>
              <i>list</i>

              List of directories that are searched for plugins to load.
              Plugins found in <i>any of the directories</i> in this
              configuration option are used. The default contains a
              Python version-specific path.

       <b>plugins</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Controls whether the plugins are enabled. Default is <b>True</b>.

       <b>protected_packages</b>
              <i>list</i>

              List of packages that DNF should never completely remove.
              They are protected via Obsoletes as well as user/plugin
              removals.

              The default is: <b>dnf</b>, <b>glob:/etc/yum/protected.d/*.conf </b>and
              <b>glob:/etc/dnf/protected.d/*.conf</b>. So any packages which
              should be protected can do so by including a file in
              <b>/etc/dnf/protected.d </b>with their package name in it.

              DNF will protect also the package corresponding to the
              running version of the kernel. See also
              <i>protect_running_kernel</i> option.

       <b>protect_running_kernel</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Controls whether the package corresponding to the running
              version of kernel is protected from removal. Default is
              <b>True</b>.

       <b>releasever</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Used for substitution of <b>$releasever </b>in the repository
              configuration.

              The <b>$releasever_major </b>and <b>$releasever_minor </b>variables will
              be automatically derived from <b>$releasever </b>by splitting it
              on the first <b>.</b>. For example, if <b>$releasever </b>is set to
              <b>1.23</b>, then <b>$releasever_major </b>will be <b>1 </b>and
              <b>$releasever_minor </b>will be <b>23</b>.

              See also <i>repo variables</i>.

       <b>reposdir</b>
              <i>list</i>

              DNF searches for repository configuration files in the
              paths specified by <b>reposdir</b>. The behavior of <b>reposdir</b>
              could differ when it is used along with -<i>-installroot</i>
              option.

       <b>rpmverbosity</b>
              <i>string</i>

              RPM debug scriptlet output level. One of: <b>critical</b>,
              <b>emergency</b>, <b>error</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info </b>or <b>debug</b>. Default is <b>info</b>.

       <b>strict </b><i>boolean</i>

              If disabled, all unavailable packages or packages with
              broken dependencies given to DNF command will be skipped
              without raising the error causing the whole operation to

              The <b>nocrypto </b>option will also set the <b>_RPMVSF_NOSIGNATURES</b>
              and <b>_RPMVSF_NODIGESTS </b>VS flags. The <b>test </b>option provides a
              transaction check without performing the transaction. It
              includes downloading of packages, gpg keys check
              (including permanent import of additional keys if
              necessary), and rpm check to prevent file conflicts.  The
              <b>nocaps </b>is supported with rpm-4.14 or later. When <b>nocaps </b>is
              used but rpm doesn't support it, DNF only reports it as an
              invalid tsflag.

       <b>upgrade_group_objects_upgrade</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Set this to False to disable the automatic running of
              <b>group upgrade </b>when running the <b>upgrade </b>command. Default is
              <b>True </b>(perform the operation).

       <b>varsdir</b>
              <i>list</i>

              List of directories where variables definition files are
              looked for. Defaults to <b>"/etc/dnf/vars", "/etc/yum/vars"</b>.
              See <i>variable files</i> in Configuration reference.

       <b>zchunk </b><i>boolean</i>

              Enables or disables the use of repository metadata
              compressed using the zchunk format (if available). Default
              is <b>True</b>.

</pre> <h2>
REPO OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>baseurl</b>
              <i>list</i>

              List of URLs for the repository. Defaults to <b>[]</b>.

              URLs are tried in the listed order (equivalent to yum's
              "failovermethod=priority" behaviour).

       <b>cost   </b><i>integer</i>

              The relative cost of accessing this repository, defaulting
              to 1000. This value is compared when the priorities of two
              repositories are the same. The repository with <i>the lowest</i>
              <i>cost</i> is picked. It is useful to make the library prefer
              on-disk repositories to remote ones.

       <b>enabled</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Include this repository as a package source. The default
              is True.

       <b>gpgkey </b><i>list</i> of strings

              URLs of a GPG key files that can be used for signing
              metadata and packages of this repository, empty by
              default. If a file can not be verified using the already
              imported keys, import of keys from this option is
              attempted and the keys are then used for verification.

       <b>metalink</b>
              <i>string</i>

              URL of a metalink for the repository. Defaults to <b>None</b>.

       <b>mirrorlist</b>
              <i>string</i>

              URL of a mirrorlist for the repository. Defaults to <b>None</b>.

       <b>module_hotfixes</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Set this to True to disable module RPM filtering and make
              all RPMs from the repository available. The default is
              False.  This allows user to create a repository with
              cherry-picked hotfixes that are included in a package set
              on a modular system.

       <b>name   </b><i>string</i>

              A human-readable name of the repository. Defaults to the
              ID of the repository.

       <b>priority</b>
              <i>integer</i>

              The priority value of this repository, default is 99. If
              there is more than one candidate package for a particular
              operation, the one from a repo with <i>the lowest priority</i>
              <i>value</i> is picked, possibly despite being less convenient
              otherwise (e.g. by being a lower version).

       <b>type   </b><i>string</i>

              Type of repository metadata. Supported values are: <b>rpm-md</b>.
              Aliases for <b>rpm-md</b>: <b>rpm</b>, <b>repomd</b>, <b>rpmmd</b>, <b>yum</b>, <b>YUM</b>.
</pre> <h2>
REPO VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       Right side of every repo option can be enriched by the following
       variables:

       <b>$arch</b>
          Refers to the system’s CPU architecture e.g, aarch64, i586,
          i686 and x86_64.

       <b>$basearch</b>
          Refers to the base architecture of the system. For example,
          i686 and i586 machines both have a base architecture of i386,
          and AMD64 and Intel64 machines have a base architecture of
          x86_64.

       <b>$releasever</b>
          Refers to the release version of operating system which DNF
          derives from information available in RPMDB.

       <b>$releasever_major</b>
          Major version of <b>$releasever</b>, i.e. the component of
          <b>$releasever </b>occurring before the first <b>.</b>.

       <b>$releasever_minor</b>
          Minor version of <b>$releasever</b>, i.e. the component of
          <b>$releasever </b>occurring after the first <b>.</b>.

       In addition to these hard coded variables, user-defined ones can
       also be used. They can be defined either via <i>variable files</i>, or
       by using special environmental variables. The names of these
       variables must be prefixed with DNF_VAR_ and they can only
       consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores:

          $ DNF_VAR_MY_VARIABLE=value

       To use such variable in your repository configuration remove the
       prefix. E.g.:

          [myrepo]
          baseurl=https://example.site/pub/fedora/$MY_VARIABLE/releases/$releasever

       Note that it is not possible to override the <b>arch </b>and <b>basearch</b>
       variables using either variable files or environmental variables.

       Although users are encouraged to use named variables, the
       numbered environmental variables <b>DNF0 </b>- <b>DNF9 </b>are still supported:

          $ DNF1=value

          [myrepo]
          baseurl=https://example.site/pub/fedora/$DNF1/releases/$releasever

       A limited form of shell-like parameter expansion is supported for
       variables.

       <b>${my_variable:-word} </b>If <b>my_variable </b>is unset or empty, then <b>word</b>
       will be substituted. Otherwise, the value of <b>my_variable </b>will be
       substituted.

       <b>${my_variable:+word} </b>If <b>my_variable </b>is set and not empty, then
       <b>word </b>will be substituted. Otherwise, the empty string will be
       substituted.

       Parameter expansions can be nested up to a maximum depth of 32.
       For example:

          ${my_defined_variable:+${my_undefined_variable:-foobar}}

       will evaluate to <b>foobar</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS FOR BOTH [MAIN] AND REPO </h2>
<pre>
       Some options can be applied in either the main section, per
       repository, or in a combination. The value provided in the main
       section is used for all repositories as the default value, which
       repositories can then override in their configuration.

       <b>bandwidth</b>
              storage size

              Total bandwidth available for downloading. Meaningful when
              used with the <i>throttle option</i>. Storage size is in bytes by
              default but can be specified with a unit of storage. Valid
              units are 'k', 'M', 'G'.

       <b>countme</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              When enabled, one (and only one) HTTP GET request for the
              metalink file will be selected at random every week to
              carry a special URL flag.

              This flag allows the repository provider to estimate the
              number of systems consuming the repository, by counting
              such requests over a week's time.  This method is more
              accurate than just counting unique IP addresses (which is
              subject to both overcounting and undercounting due to
              short DHCP leases and NAT, respectively).

              This is <i>not</i> an out-of-band HTTP request made for this
              purpose alone.  Only requests initiated by DNF during
              normal operation, such as to check for metadata updates,
              can get this flag.

              The flag is a simple "countme=N" parameter appended to the
              metalink URL where N is an integer representing the age
              "bucket" this system belongs to.  Four buckets are
              defined, based on how many full weeks have passed since
              the installation of a system:
                        ┌────────┬──────────────────────────┐
                        │ bucket │ system age               │
                        ├────────┼──────────────────────────┤
                        │ 1      │ first week               │
                        ├────────┼──────────────────────────┤
                        │ 2      │ first month (2 - 4       │

                        ├────────┼──────────────────────────┤

                        └────────┴──────────────────────────┘

              This number is meant to help distinguish short-lived
              (throwaway) machines from long-term installs and get a
              better picture of how systems are used over time.

              To determine a system's installation time ("epoch"), the
              <a href="machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a> file's modification time is used as the
              single source of truth.  This file is semantically tied to
              the system's lifetime as it's typically populated at
              installation time or during the first boot by an installer
              tool or init system (such as <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>), respectively,
              and remains unchanged.

              If the file is empty or missing (such as in containers),
              the time of the very first request made using the expanded
              metalink URL (i.e. with any repository variables such as
              <b>$releasever </b>substituted) that carried the flag is declared
              as the epoch.

              If no metalink URL is defined for this repository but a
              mirrorlist URL is, the latter is used for this purpose
              instead.

              Default is False.

       <b>deltarpm</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              When enabled, DNF will save bandwidth by downloading much
              smaller delta RPM files, rebuilding them to RPM locally.
              However, this is quite CPU and I/O intensive. Default is
              False. It requires <i>/usr/bin/applydeltarpm</i> on the system.

       <b>deltarpm_percentage</b>
              <i>integer</i>

              When the relative size of delta vs pkg is larger than
              this, delta is not used.  Default value is 75 (Deltas must
              be at least 25% smaller than the pkg).  Use <i>0</i> to turn off
              delta rpm processing. Local repositories (with <i>file://</i>
              baseurl) have delta rpms turned off by default.

       <b>enablegroups</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Determines whether DNF will allow the use of package
              groups for this repository. Default is True (package
              groups are allowed).

       <b>excludepkgs</b>
              <i>list</i>

              Exclude packages of this repository, specified by a name
              or a glob and separated by a comma, from all operations.
              Can be disabled using <b>--disableexcludes </b>command line
              switch.  Defaults to <b>[]</b>.

       <b>fastestmirror</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              If enabled a metric is used to find the fastest available
              mirror. This overrides the order provided by the
              mirrorlist/metalink file itself. This file is often
              dynamically generated by the server to provide the best
              download speeds and enabling fastestmirror overrides this.
              The default is False.

       <b>gpgcheck</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Whether to perform GPG signature check on packages found
              in this repository.  The default is False.

              This option can only be used to strengthen the active RPM
              security policy set with the <b>%_pkgverify_level </b>macro (see
              the <b>/usr/lib/rpm/macros </b>file for details).  That means, if
              the macro is set to 'signature' or 'all' and this option
              is False, it will be overridden to True during DNF
              runtime, and a warning will be printed.  To squelch the
              warning, make sure this option is True for every enabled
              repository, and also enable <i>localpkg_gpgcheck</i>.

       <b>includepkgs</b>
              <i>list</i>

              Include packages of this repository, specified by a name
              or a glob and separated by a comma, in all operations.
              Inverse of <i>excludepkgs</i>, DNF will exclude any package in
              the repository that doesn't match this list. This works in
              conjunction with <b>excludepkgs </b>and doesn't override it, so
              if you 'excludepkgs=*.i386' and 'includepkgs=python*' then
              only packages starting with python that do not have an
              i386 arch will be seen by DNF in this repo.  Can be
              disabled using <b>--disableexcludes </b>command line switch.
              Defaults to <b>[]</b>.

       <b>ip_resolve</b>
              IP address type

              Determines how DNF resolves host names. Set this to
              '4'/'IPv4' or '6'/'IPv6' to resolve to IPv4 or IPv6
              addresses only. By default, DNF resolves to either
              addresses.

       <b>localpkg_gpgcheck</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Whether to perform a GPG signature check on local packages
              (packages in a file, not in a repository).  The default is
              False.  This option is subject to the active RPM security
              policy (see <i>gpgcheck</i> for more details).

       <b>max_parallel_downloads</b>
              <i>integer</i>

              Maximum number of simultaneous package downloads. Defaults
              to 3. Maximum of 20.

       <b>metadata_expire</b>
              time in seconds

              The period after which the remote repository is checked
              for metadata update and in the positive case the local
              metadata cache is updated. The default corresponds to 48
              hours. Set this to <b>-1 </b>or <b>never </b>to make the repo never
              considered expired. Expire of metadata can be also
              triggered by change of timestamp of configuration files
              (<b>dnf.conf</b>, <b>&lt;repo&gt;.repo</b>). See also <i>check_config_file_age</i>.

       <b>minrate</b>
              storage size

              This sets the low speed threshold in bytes per second. If
              the server is sending data at the same or slower speed
              than this value for at least <i>timeout option</i> seconds, DNF
              aborts the connection. The default is 1000. Valid units
              are 'k', 'M', 'G'.

       <b>password</b>
              <i>string</i>

              The password to use for connecting to a repository with
              basic HTTP authentication. Empty by default.

       <b>proxy  </b><i>string</i>

              URL of a proxy server to connect through. Set to an empty
              string in the repository configuration to disable proxy
              setting inherited from the main section. The expected
              format of this option is
              <b>&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;ip-or-hostname&gt;[:port]</b>.  (For backward
              compatibility, '_none_' can be used instead of the empty
              string.)

              Note: The curl environment variables (such as <b>http_proxy</b>)
              are effective if this option is unset (or '_none_' is set
              in the repository configuration). See the <b>curl </b>man page
              for details.

       <b>proxy_username</b>
              <i>string</i>

              The username to use for connecting to the proxy server.
              Empty by default.

       <b>proxy_password</b>
              <i>string</i>

              The password to use for connecting to the proxy server.
              Empty by default.

       <b>proxy_auth_method</b>
              <i>string</i>

              The authentication method used by the proxy server. Valid
              values are

              Defaults to <b>any</b>

       <b>proxy_sslcacert</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Path to the file containing the certificate authorities to
              verify proxy SSL certificates.  Empty by default - uses
              system default.

       <b>proxy_sslverify</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              When enabled, proxy SSL certificates are verified. If the
              client can not be authenticated, connecting fails and the
              repository is not used any further. If <b>False</b>, SSL
              connections can be used, but certificates are not
              verified. Default is <b>True</b>.

       <b>proxy_sslclientcert</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Path to the SSL client certificate used to connect to
              proxy server.  Empty by default.

       <b>proxy_sslclientkey</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Path to the SSL client key used to connect to proxy
              server.  Empty by default.

       <b>repo_gpgcheck</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              Whether to perform GPG signature check on this
              repository's metadata. The default is False.  Note that
              GPG keys for this check are stored separately from GPG
              keys used in package signature verification. Furthermore,
              they are also stored separately for each repository.

              This means that dnf may ask to import the same key
              multiple times. For example, when a key was already
              imported for package signature verification and this
              option is turned on, it may be needed to import it again
              for the repository.

       <b>retries</b>
              <i>integer</i>

              Set the number of total retries for downloading packages.
              The number is accumulative, so e.g. for <i>retries=10</i>, dnf
              will fail after any package download fails for eleventh
              time. Setting this to <i>0</i> makes dnf try forever. Default is
              <i>10</i>.

       <b>skip_if_unavailable</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              If enabled, DNF will continue running and disable the
              repository that couldn't be synchronized for any reason.
              This option doesn't affect skipping of unavailable
              packages after dependency resolution. To check
              inaccessibility of repository use it in combination with
              <i>refresh command line option</i>. The default is <b>False</b>.  Note
              this option in particular <i>can be set in your configuration</i>
              <i>file by your distribution</i>.

       <b>sslcacert</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Path to the file containing the certificate authorities to
              verify SSL certificates.  Empty by default - uses system
              default.

       <b>sslverify</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              When enabled, remote SSL certificates are verified. If the
              client can not be authenticated, connecting fails and the
              repository is not used any further. If <b>False</b>, SSL
              connections can be used, but certificates are not
              verified. Default is <b>True</b>.

       <b>sslverifystatus</b>
              <i>boolean</i>

              When enabled, revocation status of the server certificate
              is verified using the "Certificate Status Request" TLS
              extension (aka. OCSP stapling). Default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>sslclientcert</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Path to the SSL client certificate used to connect to
              remote sites.  Empty by default.

       <b>sslclientkey</b>
              <i>string</i>

              Path to the SSL client key used to connect to remote
              sites.  Empty by default.

       <b>throttle</b>
              storage size

              Limits the downloading speed. It might be an absolute
              value or a percentage, relative to the value of the
              <i>bandwidth option</i> option. <b>0 </b>means no throttling (the
              default). The absolute value is in bytes by default but
              can be specified with a unit of storage. Valid units are
              'k', 'M', 'G'.

       <b>timeout</b>
              time in seconds

              Number of seconds to wait for a connection before timing
              out. Used in combination with <i>minrate option</i> option.
              Defaults to 30 seconds.

       <b>username</b>
              <i>string</i>

              The username to use for connecting to repo with basic HTTP
              authentication. Empty by default.

       <b>user_agent</b>
              <i>string</i>

              The User-Agent string to include in HTTP requests sent by
              DNF.  Defaults to

                 libdnf (NAME VERSION_ID; VARIANT_ID; OS.BASEARCH)

              where NAME, VERSION_ID and VARIANT_ID are OS identifiers
              read from the <a href="os-release.5.html">os-release(5)</a> file, and OS and BASEARCH are
              the canonical OS name and base architecture, respectively.
              Example:

                 libdnf (Fedora 31; server; Linux.x86_64)
