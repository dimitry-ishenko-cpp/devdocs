NAME </h2>
<pre>
       semanage.conf - global configuration file for the SELinux
       Management library
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>semanage.conf </b>file is usually located under the directory
       /etc/selinux and it is used for run-time configuration of the
       behavior of the SELinux Management library.

       Each line should contain a configuration parameter followed by
       the equal sign ("=") and then followed by the configuration value
       for that parameter. Anything after the "#" symbol is ignored
       similarly to empty lines.

       The following parameters are allowed:

              <b>module-store</b>
                     Specify how the SELinux Management library should
                     interact with the SELinux policy store. When set to
                     "direct", the SELinux Management library writes to
                     the SELinux policy module store directly (this is
                     the default setting).  Otherwise a socket path or a
                     server name can be used for the argument.  If the
                     argument begins with "/" (as in "/foo/bar"), it
                     represents the path to a named socket that should
                     be used to connect the policy management server.
                     If the argument does not begin with a "/" (as in
                     "example.com:4242"), it should be interpreted as
                     the name of a remote policy management server to be
                     used through a TCP connection (default port is 4242
                     unless a different one is specified after the
                     server name using the colon to separate the two
                     fields).

              <b>root   </b>Specify an alternative root path to use for the
                     store. The default is "/"

              <b>store-root</b>
                     Specify an alternative store_root path to use. The
                     default is "/var/lib/selinux"

              <b>compiler-directory</b>
                     Specify an alternative directory that contains HLL
                     to CIL compilers. The default value is
                     "/usr/libexec/selinux/hll".

              <b>ignore-module-cache</b>
                     Whether or not to ignore the cache of CIL modules
                     compiled from HLL. It can be set to either "true"
                     or "false" and is set to "false" by default.  If
                     the cache is ignored, then all CIL modules are
                     recompiled from their HLL modules.

              <b>policy-version</b>
                     When generating the policy, by default <b>semanage</b>
                     will set the policy version to
                     POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX, as defined in
                     &lt;sepol/policydb/policydb.h&gt;. Change this setting if
                     a different version needs to be set for the policy.

              <b>target-platform</b>
                     The target platform to generate policies for. Valid
                     values are "selinux" and "xen", and is set to
                     "selinux" by default.

              <b>expand-check</b>
                     Whether or not to check "neverallow" rules when
                     executing all <b>semanage </b>command. It can be set to
                     either "0" (disabled) or "1" (enabled) and by
                     default it is enabled. There might be a large
                     penalty in execution time if this option is
                     enabled.

              <b>file-mode</b>
                     By default the permission mode for the run-time
                     policy files is set to 0644.

              <b>save-previous</b>
                     It controls whether the previous module directory
                     is saved after a successful commit to the policy
                     store and it can be set to either "true" or
                     "false". By default it is set to "false" (the
                     previous version is deleted).

              <b>save-linked</b>
                     It controls whether the previously linked module is
                     saved (with name "base.linked") after a successful
                     commit to the policy store.  It can be set to
                     either "true" or "false" and by default it is set
                     to "false" (the previous module is deleted).

              <b>ignoredirs</b>
                     List, separated by ";",  of directories to ignore
                     when setting up users homedirs.  Some distributions
                     use this to stop labeling /root as a homedir.

              <b>usepasswd</b>
                     Whether or not to enable the use getpwent() to
                     obtain a list of home directories to label. It can
                     be set to either "true" or "false".  By default it
                     is set to "true".

              <b>disable-genhomedircon</b>
                     It controls whether or not the genhomedircon
                     function is executed when using the <b>semanage</b>
                     command and it can be set to either "false" or
                     "true". By default the genhomedircon functionality
                     is enabled (equivalent to this option set to
                     "false").

              <b>handle-unknown</b>
                     This option overrides the kernel behavior for
                     handling permissions defined in the kernel but
                     missing from the actual policy.  It can be set to
                     "deny", "reject" or "allow". By default the setting
                     from the policy is taken.

              <b>bzip-blocksize</b>
                     It should be in the range 0-9. A value of 0 means
                     no compression. By default the bzip block size is
                     set to 9 (actual block size value is obtained after
                     multiplication by 100000).

              <b>bzip-small</b>
                     When set to "true", the bzip algorithm shall try to
                     reduce its system memory usage. It can be set to
                     either "true" or "false" and by default it is set
                     to "false".

              <b>remove-hll</b>
                     When set to "true", HLL files will be removed after
                     compilation into CIL. In order to delete HLL files
                     already compiled into CIL, modules will need to be
                     recompiled with the <b>ignore-module-cache </b>option set
                     to 'true' or using the <b>ignore-module-cache </b>option
                     with semodule. The remove-hll option can be set to
                     either "true" or "false" and by default it is set
                     to "false".

                     Please note that since this option deletes all HLL
                     files, an updated HLL compiler will not be able to
                     recompile the original HLL file into CIL.  In order
                     to compile the original HLL file into CIL, the same
                     HLL file will need to be reinstalled.

              <b>optimize-policy</b>
                     When set to "true", the kernel policy will be
                     optimized upon rebuilds.  It can be set to either
                     "true" or "false" and by default it is set to
                     "false".
