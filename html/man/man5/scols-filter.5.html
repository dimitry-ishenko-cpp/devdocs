DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The filter expression can be used by application linked with
       libsmartcols to filter output data. The application can use the
       filter before it gathers all data for the output to reduce
       resources and improve performance. This makes scols filter more
       effective than grep(1) on the complete output. For example

            lsblk --output NAME,LABEL,FSTYPE --filter 'NAME=="sda1"'

       helps lsblk(1) to not read LABELs for all block device from udevd
       or libblkid, but read it only for device sda1.

       The filter can be also used for columns which are not used in the
       output.
</pre> <h2>
SYNTAX NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       An expression consists of holders, params, and operators.

       The currently supported holder type is column name only. The name
       has to be used without quotes. Before evaluation, application map
       column names in the given expression to the output table columns
       and assign column data type to the holder. The default type is
       "string".

       The param is for representing a value directly. The currently
       supported data types are integer, float, string and boolean.

       An operator works with one or two operand(s). An operator has an
       expectation about the data type(s) of its operands. Giving an
       unexpected data type to an operator causes a syntax error. The
       library can cast between data types, the prefferred is always the
       type as specified by param and in case of expression with number
       and float the preferred is the float.

       Operators taking two operands are and, or, eq, ne, le, lt, ge,
       gt, =~, !~. Alphabetically named operators have C-language
       flavored aliases: &amp;&amp;, ||, ==, !=, &lt;, ⇐, &gt;=, and &gt;.

       ! is the only operator that takes one operand. If no operator is
       specified then expression is true if param or holder are not
       empty. For example --filter NAME will return lines where column
       NAME is not empty.

       =~ and !~ is for regular expression matching; if a string at the
       right side matches (or not matches for !~ a regular expression at
       the left side, the result is true. The right side operand must be
       a string literal.

       The precedences within operators is or, and, and eq, ne, le, gt,
       ge, =~, !~, not.
</pre> <h2>
LIMITATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       About float and integer typed values, the filter engine supports
       only non-negative numbers. The integer is unsigned 64-bit number,
       and float is long double. The integer may be followed by the
       multiplicative suffixes KiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB, and YiB
       (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB").
