NAME </h2>
<pre>
       /proc/pid/exe - symbolic link to program pathname
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/exe</i>
              Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link
              containing the actual pathname of the executed command.
              This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally;
              attempting to open it will open the executable.  You can
              even type <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/exe</i> to run another copy of the same
              executable that is being run by process <i>pid</i>.  If the
              pathname has been unlinked, the symbolic link will contain
              the string ' (deleted)' appended to the original pathname.
              In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic
              link are not available if the main thread has already
              terminated (typically by calling <a href="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit(3)</a>).

              Permission to dereference or read (<a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink(2)</a>) this
              symbolic link is governed by a ptrace access mode
              <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS </b>check; see <a href="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>.

              Under Linux 2.0 and earlier, <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/exe</i> is a pointer to
              the binary which was executed, and appears as a symbolic
              link.  A <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink(2)</a> call on this file under Linux 2.0
              returns a string in the format:

                  [device]:inode

              For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device
              major 03 (IDE, MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition
              on the first drive).

              <a href="../man1/find.1.html">find(1)</a> with the <i>-inum</i> option can be used to locate the
              file.
