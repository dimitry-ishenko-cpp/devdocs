       /proc/scsi/ - SCSI
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/scsi/</i>
              A directory with the <i>scsi</i> mid-level pseudo-file and
              various SCSI low-level driver directories, which contain a
              file for each SCSI host in this system, all of which give
              the status of some part of the SCSI IO subsystem.  These
              files contain ASCII structures and are, therefore,
              readable with <a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat(1)</a>.

              You can also write to some of the files to reconfigure the
              subsystem or switch certain features on or off.

       <i>/proc/scsi/scsi</i>
              This is a listing of all SCSI devices known to the kernel.
              The listing is similar to the one seen during bootup.
              scsi currently supports only the <i>add-single-device</i> command
              which allows root to add a hotplugged device to the list
              of known devices.

              The command

                  echo 'scsi add-single-device 1 0 5 0' &gt; /proc/scsi/scsi

              will cause host scsi1 to scan on SCSI channel 0 for a
              device on ID 5 LUN 0.  If there is already a device known
              on this address or the address is invalid, an error will
              be returned.

       <i>/proc/scsi/</i>drivername<i>/</i>
              <i>drivername</i> can currently be NCR53c7xx, aha152x, aha1542,
              aha1740, aic7xxx, buslogic, eata_dma, eata_pio, fdomain,
              in2000, pas16, qlogic, scsi_debug, seagate, t128, u15-24f,
              ultrastore, or wd7000.  These directories show up for all
              drivers that registered at least one SCSI HBA.  Every
              directory contains one file per registered host.  Every
              host-file is named after the number the host was assigned
              during initialization.

              Reading these files will usually show driver and host
              configuration, statistics, and so on.

              Writing to these files allows different things on
              different hosts.  For example, with the <i>latency</i> and
              <i>nolatency</i> commands, root can switch on and off command
              latency measurement code in the eata_dma driver.  With the
              <i>lockup</i> and <i>unlock</i> commands, root can control bus lockups
              simulated by the scsi_debug driver.
