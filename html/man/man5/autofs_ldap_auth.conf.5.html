NAME </h2>
<pre>
       autofs_ldap_auth.conf - autofs LDAP authentication configuration
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       LDAP authenticated binds, TLS encrypted connections and
       certification may be used by setting appropriate values in the
       autofs authentication configuration file and configuring the LDAP
       client with appropriate settings.  The default location of this
       file is <b>@mapdir@/autofs_ldap_auth.conf</b>.  If this file exists it
       will be used to establish whether TLS or authentication should be
       used.

       An example of this file is:

         &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
         &lt;autofs_ldap_sasl_conf
                 usetls="yes"
                 tlsrequired="no"
                 authrequired="no"
                 authtype="DIGEST-MD5"
                 user="xyz"
                 secret="abc"
         /&gt;

       If TLS encryption is to be used the location of the Certificate
       Authority certificate must be set within the LDAP client configu‐
       ration in order to validate the server certificate. If, in addi‐
       tion, a certified connection is to be used then the client cer‐
       tificate and private key file locations must also be configured
       within the LDAP client.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       This files contains a single XML element, as shown in the example
       above, with several attributes.

       The possible attributes are:

       <b>usetls="yes"|"no"</b>
              Determines whether an encrypted connection to the ldap
              server should be attempted.

       <b>tlsrequired="yes"|"no"</b>
              This flag tells whether the ldap connection must be en‐
              crypted. If set to "yes", the automounter will fail to
              start if an encrypted connection cannot be established.

       <b>authrequired="yes"|"no"|"autodetect"|"simple"</b>
              This option tells whether an authenticated connection to
              the ldap server is required in order to perform ldap
              queries. If the flag is set to yes, only sasl authenticat‐
              ed connections will be allowed. If it is set to no then
              authentication is not needed for ldap server connections.
              If it is set to autodetect then the ldap server will be
              queried to establish a suitable sasl authentication mecha‐
              nism. If no suitable mechanism can be found, connections
              to the ldap server are made without authentication. Final‐
              ly, if it is set to simple, then simple authentication
              will be used instead of SASL.

       <b>authtype="GSSAPI"|"LOGIN"|"PLAIN"|"ANONYMOUS"|"DIGEST-</b>
       <b>MD5"|"SCRAM-SHA-1"|"EXTERNAL"</b>
              This attribute can be used to specify a preferred authen‐
              tication mechanism.  In normal operations, the automounter
              will attempt to authenticate to the ldap server using the
              list of supportedSASLmechanisms obtained from the directo‐
              ry server.  Explicitly setting the authtype will bypass
              this selection and only try the mechanism specified. The
              EXTERNAL mechanism may be used to authenticate using a
              client certificate and requires that authrequired set to
              "yes" if using SSL or usetls, tlsrequired and authrequired
              all set to "yes" if using TLS, in addition to authtype be‐
              ing set to EXTERNAL.

              If using authtype EXTERNAL two additional configuration
              entries are required:

              <b>external_cert="&lt;client certificate path&gt;"</b>

              This specifies the path of the file containing the client
              certificate.

              <b>external_key="&lt;client certificate key path&gt;"</b>

              This specifies the path of the file containing the client
              certificate key.

              These two configuration entries are mandatory when using
              the EXTERNAL method as the HOME environment variable can‐
              not be assumed to be set or, if it is, to be set to the
              location we expect.

       <b>user="&lt;username&gt;"</b>
              This attribute holds the authentication identity used by
              authentication mechanisms that require it.  Legal values
              for this attribute include any printable characters that
              can be used by the selected authentication mechanism.

       <b>secret="&lt;password&gt;"</b>
              This attribute holds the secret used by authentication
              mechanisms that require it. Legal values for this at‐
              tribute include any printable characters that can be used
              by the selected authentication mechanism.

       <b>encoded_secret="&lt;base64 encoded password&gt;"</b>
              This attribute holds the base64 encoded secret used by au‐
              thentication mechanisms that require it. If this entry is
              present as well as the secret entry this value will take
              precedence.

       <b>clientprinc="&lt;GSSAPI client principal&gt;"</b>
              When using GSSAPI authentication, this attribute is con‐
              sulted to determine the principal name to use when authen‐
              ticating to the directory server. By default, this will be
              set to "autofsclient/&lt;fqdn&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;.

       <b>credentialcache="&lt;external credential cache path&gt;"</b>
              When using GSSAPI authentication, this attribute can be
              used to specify an externally configured credential cache
              that is used during authentication.  By default, autofs
              will setup a memory based credential cache.
