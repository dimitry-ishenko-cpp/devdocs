NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dnf4-transaction-json - DNF Stored Transaction JSON

       The stored transaction format is considered unstable and may
       change in an incompatible way at any time. It will work if the
       same version of dnf is used to store and replay (or between
       versions as long as it stays the same).
</pre> <h2>
TOP-LEVEL OBJECT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>version</b>
              Type: string

              The version of the stored transaction format, in the form
              <b>MAJOR.MINOR</b>.

              <b>MAJOR </b>version denotes backwards incompatible changes (old
              dnf won't work with new transaction JSON).

              <b>MINOR </b>version denotes extending the format without
              breaking backwards compatibility (old dnf can work with
              new transaction JSON).
