NAME </h2>
<pre>
       request-key.conf - Instantiation handler configuration file
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These files are used by the /sbin/request-key program to
       determine which program it should run to instantiate a key.

       request-key looks for the best match, reading all the following
       files:

                   /etc/request-key.d/*.conf
                   /etc/request-key.conf

       If it doesn't find a match, it will return an error and the
       kernel will automatically negate the key.

       The best match is defined as the line with the shortest wildcard
       skips, ranking the columns in order left to right.  If two lines
       have the same length skips, then the first read is the one taken.

       In the files, any blank line or line beginning with a hash mark
       '#' is considered to be a comment and ignored.

       All other lines are assumed to be command lines with a number of
       white space separated fields:

       &lt;op&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;description&gt; &lt;callout-info&gt; &lt;prog&gt; &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt; ...

       The first four fields are used to match the parameters passed to
       request-key by the kernel. <i>op</i> is the operation type; currently
       the only supported operation is "create".

       <i>type</i>, <i>description</i> and <i>callout-info</i> match the three parameters
       passed to <b>keyctl request2 </b>or the <b>request_key() </b>system call.  Each
       of these may contain one asterisk '*' character as a wildcard
       anywhere within the string.

       Should a match be made, the program specified by &lt;prog&gt; will be
       exec'd. This must have a fully qualified path name. argv[0] will
       be set from the part of the program name that follows the last
       slash '/' character.

       If the program name is prefixed with a pipe bar character '|',
       then the program will be forked and exec'd attached to three
       pipes. The callout information will be piped to it on it's stdin
       and the intended payload data will be retrieved from its stdout.
       Anything sent to stderr will be posted in syslog. If the program
       exits 0, then /sbin/request-key will attempt to instantiate the
       key with the data read from stdout. If it fails in any other way,
       then request-key will attempt to execute the appropriate 'negate'
       operation command.

       The program arguments can be substituted with various macros.
       Only complete argument substitution is supported - macro
       substitutions can't be embedded. All macros begin with a percent
       character '%'. An argument beginning with two percent characters
       will have one of them discarded.

       The following macros are supported:

              %o    Operation type
              %k    Key ID
              %t    Key type
              %d    Key description
              %c    Callout information
              %u    Key UID
              %g    Key GID
              %T    Requestor's thread keyring
              %P    Requestor's process keyring
              %S    Requestor's session keyring

       There's another macro substitution too that permits the
       interpolation of the contents of a key:

              %{&lt;type&gt;:&lt;description&gt;}

       This performs a lookup for a key of the given type and
       description on the requestor's keyrings, and if found,
       substitutes the contents for the macro. If not found an error
       will be logged and the key under construction will be negated.

EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       A basic file will be installed in the /etc. This will contain two
       debugging lines that can be used to test the installation:

              create user debug:* negate /bin/keyctl negate %k 30 %S
              create user debug:loop:* * |/bin/cat
              create user debug:* *
              /usr/share/keyutils/request-key-debug.sh %k %d %c %S
              negate * * * /bin/keyctl negate %k 30 %S

       This is set up so that something like:

              keyctl request2 user debug:xxxx negate

       will create a negative user-defined key, something like:

              keyctl request2 user debug:yyyy spoon

       will create an instantiated user-defined key with "Debug spoon"
       as the payload, and something like:

              keyctl request2 user debug:loop:zzzz abcdefghijkl

       will create an instantiated user-defined key with the callout
       information as the payload.
