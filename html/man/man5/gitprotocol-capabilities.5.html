NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gitprotocol-capabilities - Protocol v0 and v1 capabilities
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;over-the-wire-protocol&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
           <b>Note</b>

           this document describes capabilities for versions 0 and 1 of
           the pack protocol. For version 2, please refer to the
           <a href="gitprotocol-v2.5.html">gitprotocol-v2(5)</a> doc.

       Servers SHOULD support all capabilities defined in this document.

       On the very first line of the initial server response of either
       receive-pack and upload-pack the first reference is followed by a
       NUL byte and then a list of space delimited server capabilities.
       These allow the server to declare what it can and cannot support
       to the client.

       Client will then send a space separated list of capabilities it
       wants to be in effect. The client MUST NOT ask for capabilities
       the server did not say it supports.

       Server MUST diagnose and abort if capabilities it does not
       understand were sent. Server MUST NOT ignore capabilities that
       client requested and server advertised. As a consequence of these
       rules, server MUST NOT advertise capabilities it does not
       understand.

       The <i>atomic</i>, <i>report-status</i>, <i>report-status-v2</i>, <i>delete-refs</i>, <i>quiet</i>,
       and <i>push-cert</i> capabilities are sent and recognized by the
       receive-pack (push to server) process.

       The <i>ofs-delta</i> and <i>side-band-64k</i> capabilities are sent and
       recognized by both upload-pack and receive-pack protocols. The
       <i>agent</i> and <i>session-id</i> capabilities may optionally be sent in both
       protocols.

       All other capabilities are only recognized by the upload-pack
       (fetch from server) process.
</pre> <h2>
MULTI_ACK </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>multi_ack</i> capability allows the server to return "ACK obj-id
       continue" as soon as it finds a commit that it can use as a
       common base, between the client’s wants and the client’s have
       set.

       By sending this early, the server can potentially head off the
       client from walking any further down that particular branch of
       the client’s repository history. The client may still need to
       walk down other branches, sending have lines for those, until the
       server has a complete cut across the DAG, or the client has said
       "done".

       Without multi_ack, a client sends have lines in --date-order
       until the server has found a common base. That means the client
       will send have lines that are already known by the server to be
       common, because they overlap in time with another branch on which
       the server hasn’t found a common base yet.

       For example suppose the client has commits in caps that the
       server doesn’t and the server has commits in lower case that the
       client doesn’t, as in the following diagram:

              +---- u ---------------------- x
             /              +----- y
            /              /
           a -- b -- c -- d -- E -- F
              \
               +--- Q -- R -- S

       If the client wants x,y and starts out by saying have F,S, the
       server doesn’t know what F,S is. Eventually the client says "have
       d" and the server sends "ACK d continue" to let the client know
       to stop walking down that line (so don’t send c-b-a), but it’s
       not done yet, it needs a base for x. The client keeps going with
       S-R-Q, until a gets reached, at which point the server has a
       clear base and it all ends.

       Without multi_ack the client would have sent that c-b-a chain
       anyway, interleaved with S-R-Q.
</pre> <h2>
MULTI_ACK_DETAILED </h2>
<pre>
       This is an extension of multi_ack that permits the client to
       better understand the server’s in-memory state. See
       <a href="gitprotocol-pack.5.html">gitprotocol-pack(5)</a>, section "Packfile Negotiation" for more
       information.
</pre> <h2>
NO-DONE </h2>
<pre>
       This capability should only be used with the smart HTTP protocol.
       If multi_ack_detailed and no-done are both present, then the
       sender is free to immediately send a pack following its first
       "ACK obj-id ready" message.

       Without no-done in the smart HTTP protocol, the server session
       would end and the client has to make another trip to send "done"
       before the server can send the pack. no-done removes the last
       round and thus slightly reduces latency.
</pre> <h2>
THIN-PACK </h2>
<pre>
       A thin pack is one with deltas which reference base objects not
       contained within the pack (but are known to exist at the
       receiving end). This can reduce the network traffic
       significantly, but it requires the receiving end to know how to
       "thicken" these packs by adding the missing bases to the pack.

       The upload-pack server advertises <i>thin-pack</i> when it can generate
       and send a thin pack. A client requests the <i>thin-pack</i> capability
       when it understands how to "thicken" it, notifying the server
       that it can receive such a pack. A client MUST NOT request the
       <i>thin-pack</i> capability if it cannot turn a thin pack into a
       self-contained pack.

       Receive-pack, on the other hand, is assumed by default to be able
       to handle thin packs, but can ask the client not to use the
       feature by advertising the <i>no-thin</i> capability. A client MUST NOT
       send a thin pack if the server advertises the <i>no-thin</i> capability.

       The reasons for this asymmetry are historical. The receive-pack
       program did not exist until after the invention of thin packs, so
       historically the reference implementation of receive-pack always
       understood thin packs. Adding <i>no-thin</i> later allowed receive-pack
       to disable the feature in a backwards-compatible manner.
</pre> <h2>
SIDE-BAND, SIDE-BAND-64K </h2>
<pre>
       This capability means that the server can send, and the client
       can understand, multiplexed progress reports and error info
       interleaved with the packfile itself.

       These two options are mutually exclusive. A modern client always
       favors <i>side-band-64k</i>.

       Either mode indicates that the packfile data will be streamed
       broken up into packets of up to either 1000 bytes in the case of
       <i>side_band</i>, or 65520 bytes in the case of <i>side_band_64k</i>. Each
       packet is made up of a leading 4-byte pkt-line length of how much
       data is in the packet, followed by a 1-byte stream code, followed
       by the actual data.

       The stream code can be one of:

           1 - pack data
           2 - progress messages
           3 - fatal error message just before stream aborts

       The "side-band-64k" capability came about as a way for newer
       clients that can handle much larger packets to request packets
       that are actually crammed nearly full, while maintaining backward
       compatibility for the older clients.

       Further, with side-band and its up to 1000-byte messages, it’s
       actually 999 bytes of payload and 1 byte for the stream code.
       With side-band-64k, same deal, you have up to 65519 bytes of data
       and 1 byte for the stream code.

       The client MUST send only one of "side-band" and "side-
       band-64k". The server MUST diagnose it as an error if client
       requests both.
</pre> <h2>
OFS-DELTA </h2>
<pre>
       The server can send, and the client can understand, PACKv2 with
       delta referring to its base by position in pack rather than by an
       obj-id. That is, they can send/read OBJ_OFS_DELTA (aka type 6) in
       a packfile.
</pre> <h2>
AGENT </h2>
<pre>
       The server may optionally send a capability of the form <b>agent=X</b>
       to notify the client that the server is running version <b>X</b>. The
       client may optionally return its own agent string by responding
       with an <b>agent=Y </b>capability (but it MUST NOT do so if the server
       did not mention the agent capability). The <b>X </b>and <b>Y </b>strings may
       contain any printable ASCII characters except space (i.e., the
       byte range 32 &lt; x &lt; 127), and are typically of the form
       "package/version" (e.g., "git/1.8.3.1"). The agent strings are
       purely informative for statistics and debugging purposes, and
       MUST NOT be used to programmatically assume the presence or
       absence of particular features.
</pre> <h2>
OBJECT-FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       This capability, which takes a hash algorithm as an argument,
       indicates that the server supports the given hash algorithms. It
       may be sent multiple times; if so, the first one given is the one
       used in the ref advertisement.

       When provided by the client, this indicates that it intends to
       use the given hash algorithm to communicate. The algorithm
       provided must be one that the server supports.

       If this capability is not provided, it is assumed that the only
       supported algorithm is SHA-1.
</pre> <h2>
SYMREF </h2>
<pre>
       This parameterized capability is used to inform the receiver
       which symbolic ref points to which ref; for example,
       "symref=HEAD:refs/heads/master" tells the receiver that HEAD
       points to master. This capability can be repeated to represent
       multiple symrefs.

       Servers SHOULD include this capability for the HEAD symref if it
       is one of the refs being sent.

       Clients MAY use the parameters from this capability to select the
       proper initial branch when cloning a repository.
</pre> <h2>
SHALLOW </h2>
<pre>
       This capability adds "deepen", "shallow" and "unshallow" commands
       to the fetch-pack/upload-pack protocol so clients can request
       shallow clones.
</pre> <h2>
DEEPEN-SINCE </h2>
<pre>
       This capability adds "deepen-since" command to
       fetch-pack/upload-pack protocol so the client can request shallow
       clones that are cut at a specific time, instead of depth.
       Internally it’s equivalent of doing "rev-list
       --max-age=&lt;timestamp&gt;" on the server side. "deepen-since" cannot
       be used with "deepen".
</pre> <h2>
DEEPEN-NOT </h2>
<pre>
       This capability adds "deepen-not" command to
       fetch-pack/upload-pack protocol so the client can request shallow
       clones that are cut at a specific revision, instead of depth.
       Internally it’s equivalent of doing "rev-list --not &lt;rev&gt;" on the
       server side. "deepen-not" cannot be used with "deepen", but can
       be used with "deepen-since".
</pre> <h2>
DEEPEN-RELATIVE </h2>
<pre>
       If this capability is requested by the client, the semantics of
       "deepen" command is changed. The "depth" argument is the depth
       from the current shallow boundary, instead of the depth from
       remote refs.
</pre> <h2>
NO-PROGRESS </h2>
<pre>
       The client was started with "git clone -q" or something similar,
       and doesn’t want that side band 2. Basically the client just says
       "I do not wish to receive stream 2 on sideband, so do not send it
       to me, and if you did, I will drop it on the floor anyway".
       However, the sideband channel 3 is still used for error
       responses.
</pre> <h2>
INCLUDE-TAG </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>include-tag</i> capability is about sending annotated tags if we
       are sending objects they point to. If we pack an object to the
       client, and a tag object points exactly at that object, we pack
       the tag object too. In general this allows a client to get all
       new annotated tags when it fetches a branch, in a single network
       connection.

       Clients MAY always send include-tag, hardcoding it into a request
       when the server advertises this capability. The decision for a
       client to request include-tag only has to do with the client’s
       desires for tag data, whether or not a server had advertised
       objects in the refs/tags/* namespace.

       Servers MUST pack the tags if their referent is packed and the
       client has requested include-tags.

       Clients MUST be prepared for the case where a server has ignored
       include-tag and has not actually sent tags in the pack. In such
       cases the client SHOULD issue a subsequent fetch to acquire the
       tags that include-tag would have otherwise given the client.

       The server SHOULD send include-tag, if it supports it, regardless
       of whether or not there are tags available.
</pre> <h2>
REPORT-STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The receive-pack process can receive a <i>report-status</i> capability,
       which tells it that the client wants a report of what happened
       after a packfile upload and reference update. If the pushing
       client requests this capability, after unpacking and updating
       references the server will respond with whether the packfile
       unpacked successfully and if each reference was updated
       successfully. If any of those were not successful, it will send
       back an error message. See <a href="gitprotocol-pack.5.html">gitprotocol-pack(5)</a> for example
       messages.
</pre> <h2>
REPORT-STATUS-V2 </h2>
<pre>
       Capability <i>report-status-v2</i> extends capability <i>report-status</i> by
       adding new "option" directives in order to support reference
       rewritten by the "proc-receive" hook. The "proc-receive" hook may
       handle a command for a pseudo-reference which may create or
       update a reference with different name, new-oid, and old-oid.
       While the capability <i>report-status</i> cannot report for such case.
       See <a href="gitprotocol-pack.5.html">gitprotocol-pack(5)</a> for details.
</pre> <h2>
DELETE-REFS </h2>
<pre>
       If the server sends back the <i>delete-refs</i> capability, it means
       that it is capable of accepting a zero-id value as the target
       value of a reference update. It is not sent back by the client,
       it simply informs the client that it can be sent zero-id values
       to delete references.
</pre> <h2>
QUIET </h2>
<pre>
       If the receive-pack server advertises the <i>quiet</i> capability, it is
       capable of silencing human-readable progress output which
       otherwise may be shown when processing the received pack. A
       send-pack client should respond with the <i>quiet</i> capability to
       suppress server-side progress reporting if the local progress
       reporting is also being suppressed (e.g., via <b>push -q</b>, or if
       stderr does not go to a tty).
</pre> <h2>
ATOMIC </h2>
<pre>
       If the server sends the <i>atomic</i> capability it is capable of
       accepting atomic pushes. If the pushing client requests this
       capability, the server will update the refs in one atomic
       transaction. Either all refs are updated or none.
</pre> <h2>
PUSH-OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       If the server sends the <i>push-options</i> capability it is able to
       accept push options after the update commands have been sent, but
       before the packfile is streamed. If the pushing client requests
       this capability, the server will pass the options to the pre- and
       post- receive hooks that process this push request.
</pre> <h2>
ALLOW-TIP-SHA1-IN-WANT </h2>
<pre>
       If the upload-pack server advertises this capability, fetch-pack
       may send "want" lines with object names that exist at the server
       but are not advertised by upload-pack. For historical reasons,
       the name of this capability contains "sha1". Object names are
       always given using the object format negotiated through the
       <i>object-format</i> capability.
</pre> <h2>
ALLOW-REACHABLE-SHA1-IN-WANT </h2>
<pre>
       If the upload-pack server advertises this capability, fetch-pack
       may send "want" lines with object names that exist at the server
       but are not advertised by upload-pack. For historical reasons,
       the name of this capability contains "sha1". Object names are
       always given using the object format negotiated through the
       <i>object-format</i> capability.
</pre> <h2>
PUSH-CERT=&lt;NONCE&gt; </h2>
<pre>
       The receive-pack server that advertises this capability is
       willing to accept a signed push certificate, and asks the &lt;nonce&gt;
       to be included in the push certificate. A send-pack client MUST
       NOT send a push-cert packet unless the receive-pack server
       advertises this capability.
</pre> <h2>
FILTER </h2>
<pre>
       If the upload-pack server advertises the <i>filter</i> capability,
       fetch-pack may send "filter" commands to request a partial clone
       or partial fetch and request that the server omit various objects
       from the packfile.
</pre> <h2>
SESSION-ID=&lt;SESSION-ID&gt; </h2>
<pre>
       The server may advertise a session ID that can be used to
       identify this process across multiple requests. The client may
       advertise its own session ID back to the server as well.

       Session IDs should be unique to a given process. They must fit
       within a packet-line, and must not contain non-printable or
       whitespace characters. The current implementation uses trace2
       session IDs (see <b>api-trace2</b>[1] for details), but this may change
       and users of the session ID should not rely on this fact.
