NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sysstat - sysstat configuration file.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This file is read by <a href="../man8/sa1.8.html">sa1(8)</a> and <a href="../man8/sa2.8.html">sa2(8)</a> shell scripts from the
       sysstat's set of tools.  It consists of a sequence of shell
       variable assignments used to configure sysstat logging.  The
       variables and their meanings are:

       <b>COMPRESSAFTER</b>
              Number of days after which daily data files are to be
              compressed.  The compression program is given in the <b>ZIP</b>
              variable.

       <b>DELAY_RANGE</b>
              Tell <b>sa2 </b>script to wait for a random delay in the
              indicated range before running.  This delay is expressed
              in seconds, and is aimed at preventing a massive I/O burst
              at the same time on VM sharing the same storage area.  A
              value of 0 means that <b>sa2 </b>script will generate its reports
              files immediately.

       <b>HISTORY</b>
              The number of days during which a daily data file or a
              report should be kept. Data files or reports older than
              this number of days will be removed by the <a href="../man8/sa2.8.html">sa2(8)</a> shell
              script.  Data files and reports are normally saved in the
              /var/log/sa directory, under the name <i>saDD</i> (for data
              files) or <i>sarDD</i> (for reports), where the <i>DD</i> parameter
              indicates the current day.

              The number of files actually kept in the /var/log/sa
              directory may be slightly higher than the <b>HISTORY </b>value
              due to the way the <b>sa2 </b>script figures out which files are
              to be removed (see below "How the <a href="../man8/sa2.8.html">sa2(8)</a> script applies
              <b>HISTORY </b>value"). Using a value of 28 keeps a whole month's
              worth of data. If you set <b>HISTORY </b>to a value greater than
              28 then you should consider using <b>sadc</b>'s option <b>-D </b>to
              prevent older data files from being overwritten (see
              <a href="../man8/sadc.8.html">sadc(8)</a> manual page). In this latter case data files are
              named <i>saYYYYMMDD</i> and reports <i>sarYYYYMMDD</i>, where <i>YYYY</i>
              stands for the current year, <i>MM</i> for the current month and
              <i>DD</i> for the current day.

              How the <a href="../man8/sa2.8.html">sa2(8)</a> script applies <b>HISTORY </b>value

              The <b>sa2 </b>script uses the <b>find </b>command with the <b>-mtime</b>
              option to figure out which files are to be removed. The
              <b>find </b>command interprets this value as "N 24 hour periods",
              ignoring any fractional part. This means that the last
              modified time of a given <i>sa[r]DD</i> data or report file,
              using a <b>HISTORY </b>of 1, has to have been modified at least
              two days ago before it will be removed. And for a <b>HISTORY</b>
              of 28 that would mean 29 days ago.

              To figure out how a <b>HISTORY </b>of 28 is applied in practice,
              we need to consider that the <b>sa2 </b>script that issues the
              <b>find </b>command to remove the old files typically runs just
              before midnight on a given system, and since the first
              record from <b>sadc </b>can also be written to the previous day's
              data file (thereby moving its modification time up a bit),
              the <b>sa2 </b>script will leave 30 files untouched. So for a
              setting of 28, and counting the data file of the current
              day, there will always be 31 files (or 30 files, depending
              on the number of days in a month) in the /var/log/sa
              directory during the majority of a given day.  E.g.:

              April 30th: 31 files (Apr 30th-1st, Mar 31th)
              May 1st: 30 files (May 1st, Apr 30th-2nd)

              Yet we can note the following exceptions (as inspected at
              Noon of the given day):

              February 28th: 31 files (Feb 28th-1st, Jan 31st, 30th &amp;
              29th)
              March 1st: 30 files (Mar 1st, Feb 28th-2nd, Jan 31st &amp;
              30th)
              March 2nd: 29 files (Mar 1st &amp; 2nd, Feb 28th-3rd, Jan.
              31st)
              March 3rd: 28 files (Mar 1st-3rd, Feb 28th-4th)
              March 4th - March 28th: 28 files
              March 29th: 29 files
              March 30th: 30 files
              March 31st: 31 files

              (Determining the number of files in March on a leap year
              is left as an exercise for the reader).

              Things are simpler if you use the <i>sa[r]YYYYMMDD</i> name
              format.  Apply the same logic as above in this case and
              you will find that there are always <b>HISTORY </b>+ 3 files in
              the <i>/var/log/sa</i> directory during the majority of a given
              day.

       <b>REPEAT_HEADER</b>
              Maximum number of lines after which a header will be
              inserted in the report generated by <b>sa2 </b>script. By default
              there is only a header at the beginning of each report and
              it is not repeated afterwards.

       <b>REPORTS</b>
              Set this variable to <b>false </b>to prevent the <b>sa2 </b>script from
              generating reports (the <i>sarDD</i> files).

       <b>SA_DIR </b>Directory where the standard system activity daily data
              and report files are saved. Its default value is
              <i>/var/log/sa</i>.

       <b>SADC_OPTIONS</b>
              Options that should be passed to <a href="../man8/sadc.8.html">sadc(8)</a>.  With these
              options (see <a href="../man8/sadc.8.html">sadc(8)</a> manual page), you can select some
              additional data which are going to be saved in daily data
              files.  These options are used only when a new data file
              is created. They will be ignored with an already existing
              one.

       <b>UMASK  </b>The <b>sa1 </b>and <b>sa2 </b>scripts generate system activity data and
              report files in the <i>/var/log/sa</i> directory. By default the
              files are created with umask 0022 and are therefore
              readable for all users. Change this variable to restrict
              the permissions on the files (e.g. use 0027 to adhere to
              more strict security standards).

       <b>YESTERDAY</b>
              By default <b>sa2 </b>script generates yesterday's summary, since
              the <b>cron </b>job usually runs right after midnight. If you
              want <b>sa2 </b>to generate the summary of the same day (for
              example when cron job runs at 23:53) set this variable to
              <b>no</b>.

       <b>ZIP    </b>Program used to compress data and report files.
