NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gitprotocol-common - Things common to various protocols
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;over-the-wire-protocol&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This document defines things common to various over-the-wire
       protocols and file formats used in Git.
</pre> <h2>
ABNF NOTATION </h2>
<pre>
       ABNF notation as described by RFC 5234 is used within the
       protocol documents, except the following replacement core rules
       are used:

             HEXDIG    =  DIGIT / "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f"

       We also define the following common rules:

             NUL       =  %x00
             zero-id   =  40*"0"
             obj-id    =  40*(HEXDIGIT)

             refname  =  "HEAD"
             refname /=  "refs/" &lt;see discussion below&gt;

       A refname is a hierarchical octet string beginning with "refs/"
       and not violating the <i>git-check-ref-format</i> command’s validation
       rules. More specifically, they:

        1. They can include slash <b>/ </b>for hierarchical (directory)
           grouping, but no slash-separated component can begin with a
           dot <b>.</b>.

        2. They must contain at least one <b>/</b>. This enforces the presence
           of a category like <b>heads/</b>, <b>tags/ </b>etc. but the actual names
           are not restricted.

        3. They cannot have two consecutive dots <b>..  </b>anywhere.

        4. They cannot have ASCII control characters (i.e. bytes whose
           values are lower than \040, or \177 <b>DEL</b>), space, tilde <b>~</b>,
           caret <b>^</b>, colon <b>:</b>, question-mark <b>?</b>, asterisk <b>*</b>, or open
           bracket <b>[ </b>anywhere.

        5. They cannot end with a slash <b>/ </b>or a dot <b>.</b>.

        6. They cannot end with the sequence <b>.lock</b>.

        7. They cannot contain a sequence <b>@{</b>.

        8. They cannot contain a <b>\\</b>.
</pre> <h2>
PKT-LINE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       Much (but not all) of the payload is described around pkt-lines.

       A pkt-line is a variable length binary string. The first four
       bytes of the line, the pkt-len, indicates the total length of the
       line, in hexadecimal. The pkt-len includes the 4 bytes used to
       contain the length’s hexadecimal representation.

       A pkt-line MAY contain binary data, so implementors MUST ensure
       pkt-line parsing/formatting routines are 8-bit clean.

       A non-binary line SHOULD BE terminated by an LF, which if present
       MUST be included in the total length. Receivers MUST treat
       pkt-lines with non-binary data the same whether or not they
       contain the trailing LF (stripping the LF if present, and not
       complaining when it is missing).

       The maximum length of a pkt-line’s data component is 65516 bytes.
       Implementations MUST NOT send pkt-line whose length exceeds 65520
       (65516 bytes of payload + 4 bytes of length data).

       Implementations SHOULD NOT send an empty pkt-line ("0004").

       A pkt-line with a length field of 0 ("0000"), called a flush-pkt,
       is a special case and MUST be handled differently than an empty
       pkt-line ("0004").

             pkt-line     =  data-pkt / flush-pkt

             data-pkt     =  pkt-len pkt-payload
             pkt-len      =  4*(HEXDIG)
             pkt-payload  =  (pkt-len - 4)*(OCTET)

             flush-pkt    = "0000"

       Examples (as C-style strings):

             pkt-line          actual value
             ---------------------------------
             "0006a\n"         "a\n"
             "0005a"           "a"
             "000bfoobar\n"    "foobar\n"
             "0004"            ""
