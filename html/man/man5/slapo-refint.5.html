NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-refint - Referential Integrity overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Referential Integrity overlay can be used with a backend
       database such as <a href="slapd-mdb.5.html">slapd-mdb(5)</a> to maintain the cohesiveness of a
       schema which utilizes reference attributes.

       Integrity is maintained by updating database records which
       contain the named attributes to match the results of a <b>modrdn </b>or
       <b>delete </b>operation. For example, if the integrity attribute were
       configured as <b>manager</b>, deletion of the record
       "uid=robert,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" would trigger a search
       for all other records which have a <b>manager </b>attribute containing
       that DN. Entries matching that search would have their <b>manager</b>
       attribute removed.  Or, renaming the same record into
       "uid=george,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" would trigger a search
       for all other records which have a <b>manager </b>attribute containing
       that DN.  Entries matching that search would have their <b>manager</b>
       attribute deleted and replaced by the new DN.

       <b>rootdn </b>must be set for the database.  refint runs as the rootdn
       to gain access to make its updates.  <b>rootpw </b>is not needed.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf </b>options apply to the Referential Integrity
       overlay.  They should appear after the <b>overlay </b>directive.

       <b>refint_attributes &lt;attribute&gt; [...]</b>
              Specify one or more attributes for which integrity will be
              maintained as described above.

       <b>refint_nothing &lt;string&gt;</b>
              Specify an arbitrary value to be used as a placeholder
              when the last value would otherwise be deleted from an
              attribute. This can be useful in cases where the schema
              requires the existence of an attribute for which
              referential integrity is enforced. The attempted deletion
              of a required attribute will otherwise result in an Object
              Class Violation, causing the request to fail.  The string
              must be a valid DN.

       <b>refint_modifiersname &lt;DN&gt;</b>
              Specify the DN to be used as the modifiersName of the
              internal modifications performed by the overlay.  It
              defaults to "<i>cn=Referential Integrity Overlay</i>".

       Modifications performed by this overlay are not propagated during
       replication. This overlay must be configured identically on
       replication consumers in order to maintain full synchronization
       with the provider.
