NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-postrm - package post-removal maintainer script
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DEBIAN/postrm</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A package can perform several post-removal actions via maintainer
       scripts, by including an executable <i>postrm</i> file in its control
       archive (i.e. <i>DEBIAN/postrm</i> during package creation).

       The script can be called in the following ways:

       <i>postrm</i> <b>remove</b>
           After the package was removed.

       <i>postrm</i> <b>purge</b>
           After the package was purged.

       <i>old-postrm</i> <b>upgrade </b><i>new-version</i>
           After the package was upgraded.

       <i>new-postrm</i> <b>failed-upgrade </b><i>old-version new-version</i>
           If the above <b>upgrade </b>call fails.

           The <i>new-version</i> is passed only since dpkg 1.18.5.

       <i>postrm</i> <b>disappear </b><i>overwriter-package overwriter-version</i>
           After all of the packages files have been replaced.

       <i>new-postrm</i> <b>abort-install</b>
           If <i>preinst</i> fails during <b>install</b>.

       <i>new-postrm</i> <b>abort-install </b><i>old-version new-version</i>
           If <i>preinst</i> fails during <b>install </b>for an upgrade of a removed
           package.

           The <i>new-version</i> is passed only since dpkg 1.18.5.

       <i>new-postrm</i> <b>abort-upgrade </b><i>old-version new-version</i>
           If <i>preinst</i> fails during <b>upgrade</b>.

           The <i>new-version</i> is passed only since dpkg 1.18.5.
