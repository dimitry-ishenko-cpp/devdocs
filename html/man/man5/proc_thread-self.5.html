DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task/</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This is a directory that contains one subdirectory for
              each thread in the process.  The name of each subdirectory
              is the numerical thread ID (<i>tid</i>) of the thread (see
              <a href="../man2/gettid.2.html">gettid(2)</a>).

              Within each of these subdirectories, there is a set of
              files with the same names and contents as under the
              <i>/proc/</i>pid directories.  For attributes that are shared by
              all threads, the contents for each of the files under the
              <i>task/</i>tid subdirectories will be the same as in the
              corresponding file in the parent <i>/proc/</i>pid directory
              (e.g., in a multithreaded process, all of the <i>task/</i>tid<i>/cwd</i>
              files will have the same value as the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cwd</i> file
              in the parent directory, since all of the threads in a
              process share a working directory).  For attributes that
              are distinct for each thread, the corresponding files
              under <i>task/</i>tid may have different values (e.g., various
              fields in each of the <i>task/</i>tid<i>/status</i> files may be
              different for each thread), or they might not exist in
              <i>/proc/</i>pid at all.

              In a multithreaded process, the contents of the
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task</i> directory are not available if the main
              thread has already terminated (typically by calling
              <a href="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit(3)</a>).

       <i>/proc/</i>tid<i>/</i>
              There  is a numerical subdirectory for each running thread
              that is not a thread group leader (i.e., a thread whose
              thread ID is not the same as its process ID); the
              subdirectory is named by the thread ID.  Each one of these
              subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing
              information about the thread with the thread ID <i>tid</i>.  The
              contents of these directories are the same as the
              corresponding <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task/</i>tid directories.

              The <i>/proc/</i>tid subdirectories are <i>not</i> visible when
              iterating through <i>/proc</i> with <a href="../man2/getdents.2.html">getdents(2)</a> (and thus are <i>not</i>
              visible when one uses <a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls(1)</a> to view the contents of
              <i>/proc</i>).  However, the pathnames of these directories are
              visible to (i.e., usable as arguments in) system calls
              that operate on pathnames.

       <i>/proc/thread-self/</i> (since Linux 3.17)
              This directory refers to the thread accessing the <i>/proc</i>
              filesystem, and is identical to the <i>/proc/self/task/</i>tid
              directory named by the process thread ID (<i>tid</i>) of the same
              thread.
