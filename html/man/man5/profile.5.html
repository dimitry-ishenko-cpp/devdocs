NAME </h2>
<pre>
       profile - Security profile file syntax, and information about
       building new application profiles.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       Using a specific profile:

              <b>firejail --profile=filename.profile</b>

                     Example:
                     $ firejail --appimage
                     --profile=/etc/firejail/kdenlive.profile
                     kdenlive.appimage

              <b>firejail --profile=profile_name</b>

                     Example:
                     $ firejail --appimage --profile=kdenlive
                     kdenlive.appimage

       Building a profile manually:

              Start with the template in
              /usr/share/doc/firejail/profile.template and modify it in
              a text editor.  To integrate the program in your desktop
              environment copy the profile file in ~/.config/firejail
              directory and run "sudo firecfg".

       Aliases and redirections:

              In some cases the same profile can be used for several
              applications.  One such example is LibreOffice.  Build a
              regular profile for the main application, and for the rest
              use /usr/share/doc/firejail/redirect_alias-
              profile.template.

       Running the profile builder:

              <b>firejail --build=appname.profile appname</b>

                     Example:
                     $ firejail --build=blobby.profile blobby

                     Run the program in "firejail --build" and try to
                     exercise as many program features as possible.  The
                     profile is extracted and saved in the current
                     directory. Open it in a text editor and add or
                     remove sandboxing options as necessary. Test again
                     after modifying the profile. To integrate the
                     program in your desktop environment copy the
                     profile file in ~/.config/firejail directory and
                     run "sudo firecfg".
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Several command line options can be passed to the program using
       profile files. Firejail chooses the profile file as follows:

       <b>1. </b>If a profile file is provided by the user with --profile
       option, the profile file is loaded. If a profile name is given,
       it is searched for first in the ~/.config/firejail directory and
       if not found then in /etc/firejail directory. Profile names do
       not include the .profile suffix.  Example:

              $ firejail --profile=/home/netblue/icecat.profile icecat
              Reading profile /home/netblue/icecat.profile
              [...]

              $ firejail --profile=icecat icecat-wrapper.sh
              Reading profile /etc/firejail/icecat.profile
              [...]

       <b>2. </b>If a profile file with the same name as the application is
       present in ~/.config/firejail directory or in /etc/firejail, the
       profile is loaded. ~/.config/firejail takes precedence over
       /etc/firejail. Example:

              $ firejail icecat
              Command name #icecat#
              Found icecat profile in /home/netblue/.config/firejail
              directory
              Reading profile
              /home/netblue/.config/firejail/icecat.profile
              [...]

       <b>3. </b>Use a default.profile file if the sandbox is started by a
       regular user, or a server.profile file if the sandbox is started
       by root. Firejail looks for these files in ~/.config/firejail
       directory, followed by /etc/firejail directory.  To disable
       default profile loading, use --noprofile command option. Example:

              $ firejail
              Reading profile /etc/firejail/default.profile
              Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
              Child process initialized
              [...]

              $ firejail --noprofile
              Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
              Child process initialized
              [...]
</pre> <h2>
Templates </h2>
<pre>
       In /usr/share/doc/firejail there are two templates to write new
       profiles.
              profile.template - for regular profiles
              redirect_alias-profile.template - for aliasing/redirecting
              profiles
</pre> <h2>
Scripting </h2>
<pre>
       Scripting commands:

       <b>File and directory names</b>
              File and directory names containing spaces are supported.
              The space character ' ' should not be escaped.

              Example: "blacklist ~/My Virtual Machines"

       <b># this is a comment</b>
              Example:

              # disable networking
              net none # this command creates an empty network namespace

       <b>?CONDITIONAL: profile line</b>
              Conditionally add profile line.

              Example: "?HAS_APPIMAGE: whitelist
              ${HOME}/special/appimage/dir"

              This example will load the whitelist profile line only if
              the --appimage option has been specified on the command
              line.

              Currently the only conditionals supported this way are
              HAS_APPIMAGE, HAS_NET, HAS_NODBUS, HAS_NOSOUND,
              HAS_PRIVATE and HAS_X11. The conditionals ALLOW_TRAY,
              BROWSER_DISABLE_U2F and BROWSER_ALLOW_DRM can be enabled
              or disabled globally in Firejail's configuration file.

              The profile line may be any profile line that you would
              normally use in a profile <b>except </b>for "quiet" and "include"
              lines.

              Note: When using one or more conditionals and <b>--profile</b>,
              it is recommended that the relevant option(s) (such as
              <b>--appimage</b>) be specified before <b>--profile</b>, so that their
              respective conditional(s) (such as <b>?HAS_APPIMAGE</b>) inside
              of the profile evaluate to true.

       <b>include other.profile</b>
              Include other.profile file.

              Example: "include /etc/firejail/disable-common.inc"

              The file name can be prefixed with a macro such as ${HOME}
              or ${CFG}.  ${HOME} is expanded as user home directory,
              and ${CFG} is expanded as Firejail system configuration
              directory - in most cases /etc/firejail or
              /usr/local/etc/firejail.

              Example: "include ${HOME}/myprofiles/profile1" will load
              "~/myprofiles/profile1" file.

              Example: "include ${CFG}/firefox.profile" will load
              "/etc/firejail/firefox.profile" file.

              The file name may also be just the name without the
              leading directory components.  In this case, first the
              user config directory (${HOME}/.config/firejail) is
              searched for the file name and if not found then the
              system configuration directory is search for the file
              name.  Note: Unlike the --profile option which takes a
              profile name without the '.profile' suffix, include must
              be given the full file name.

              Example: "include firefox.profile" will load
              "${HOME}/.config/firejail/firefox.profile" file and if it
              does not exist "${CFG}/firefox.profile" will be loaded.

              System configuration files in ${CFG} are overwritten
              during software installation.  Persistent configuration at
              system level is handled in ".local" files. For every
              profile file in ${CFG} directory, the user can create a
              corresponding .local file storing modifications to the
              persistent configuration. Persistent .local files are
              included at the start of regular profile files.

       <b>noblacklist file_name</b>
              If the file name matches file_name, the file will not be
              blacklisted in any blacklist commands that follow.

              Example: "noblacklist ${HOME}/.mozilla"

       <b>nowhitelist file_name</b>
              If the file name matches file_name, the file will not be
              whitelisted in any whitelist commands that follow.

              Example: "nowhitelist ~/.config"

       <b>ignore </b>Ignore command.

              Example: "ignore seccomp"
              Example: "ignore net eth0"

       <b>quiet  </b>Disable Firejail's output. This should be the first
              uncommented command in the profile file.

              Example: "quiet"
</pre> <h2>
Filesystem </h2>
<pre>
       These profile entries define a chroot filesystem built on top of
       the existing host filesystem. Each line describes a
       file/directory that is inaccessible (<b>blacklist</b>), a read-only file
       or directory (<b>read-only</b>), a tmpfs mounted on top of an existing
       directory (<b>tmpfs</b>), or mount-bind a directory or file on top of
       another directory or file (<b>bind</b>).  Use <b>private </b>to set private
       mode.  File globbing is supported, and PATH and HOME directories
       are searched, see the <b>firejail FILE GLOBBING </b>section for more
       details.  Examples:

       <b>blacklist file_or_directory</b>
              Blacklist directory or file. Examples:

              blacklist /usr/bin
              blacklist /usr/bin/gcc*
              blacklist ${PATH}/ifconfig
              blacklist ${HOME}/.ssh

       <b>blacklist-nolog file_or_directory</b>
              When --tracelog flag is set, blacklisting generates syslog
              messages if the sandbox tries to access the file or
              directory.  blacklist-nolog command disables syslog
              messages for this particular file or directory. Examples:

              blacklist-nolog /usr/bin
              blacklist-nolog /usr/bin/gcc*

       <b>bind directory1,directory2</b>
              Mount-bind directory1 on top of directory2. This option is
              only available when running as root.

       <b>bind file1,file2</b>
              Mount-bind file1 on top of file2. This option is only
              available when running as root.

       <b>disable-mnt</b>
              Disable /mnt, /media, /run/mount and /run/media access.

       <b>keep-config-pulse</b>
              Disable automatic ~/.config/pulse init, for complex setups
              such as remote pulse servers or non-standard socket paths.

       <b>keep-dev-shm</b>
              /dev/shm directory is untouched (even with private-dev).

       <b>keep-shell-rc</b>
              Do not copy shell rc files (such as ~/.bashrc and
              ~/.zshrc) from /etc/skel.

       <b>keep-var-tmp</b>
              /var/tmp directory is untouched.

       <b>mkdir directory</b>
              Create a directory in user home, under /tmp, or under
              /run/user/&lt;UID&gt; before the sandbox is started.  The
              directory is created if it doesn't already exist.

              Use this command for whitelisted directories you need to
              preserve when the sandbox is closed. Without it, the
              application will create the directory, and the directory
              will be deleted when the sandbox is closed. Subdirectories
              are recursively created. Example from firefox profile:

              mkdir ~/.mozilla
              whitelist ~/.mozilla
              mkdir ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox
              whitelist ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox

              For files in /run/user/&lt;PID&gt; use ${RUNUSER} macro:

              mkdir ${RUNUSER}/firejail-testing

       <b>mkfile file</b>
              Similar to mkdir, this command creates an empty file in
              user home, or /tmp, or under /run/user/&lt;UID&gt; before the
              sandbox is started. The file is created if it doesn't
              already exist.

       <b>noexec file_or_directory</b>
              Remount the file or the directory noexec, nodev and
              nosuid.

       <b>private</b>
              Mount new /root and /home/user directories in temporary
              filesystems. All modifications are discarded when the
              sandbox is closed.

       <b>private directory</b>
              Use directory as user home.  --private and
              --private=directory cannot be used together.

              Bug: Even with this enabled, some commands (such as mkdir,
              mkfile and private-cache) will still operate on the
              original home directory.  Workaround: Disable the
              incompatible commands, such as by using "ignore mkdir" and
              "ignore mkfile".  For details, see #903 
              ⟨<a href="https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/903">https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/903</a>⟩

       <b>private-bin file,file</b>
              Build a new /bin in a temporary filesystem, and copy the
              programs in the list.  The files in the list must be
              expressed as relative to the /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin,
              /usr/sbin, or /usr/local/bin directories.  The same
              directory is also bind-mounted over /sbin, /usr/bin and
              /usr/sbin.  Multiple private-bin commands are allowed and
              they accumulate.

       <b>private-cache</b>
              Mount an empty temporary filesystem on top of the .cache
              directory in user home. All modifications are discarded
              when the sandbox is closed.

       <b>private-cwd</b>
              Set working directory inside jail to the home directory,
              and failing that, the root directory.

       <b>private-cwd directory</b>
              Set working directory inside the jail. Full directory path
              is required. Symbolic links are not allowed.

       <b>private-dev</b>
              Create a new /dev directory. Only disc, dri, dvb, hidraw,
              null, full, zero, tty, pts, ptmx, random, snd, urandom,
              video, log, shm and usb devices are available.  Use the
              options no3d, nodvd, nosound, notv, nou2f and novideo for
              additional restrictions.

       <b>private-etc file,directory</b>
              Build a new /etc in a temporary filesystem, and copy the
              files and directories in the list.  The files and
              directories in the list must be expressed as relative to
              the /etc directory, and must not contain the / character
              (e.g., /etc/foo must be expressed as foo, but /etc/foo/bar
              -- expressed as foo/bar -- is disallowed).  All
              modifications are discarded when the sandbox is closed.
              Multiple private-etc commands are allowed and they
              accumulate.

       <b>private-home file,directory</b>
              Build a new user home in a temporary filesystem, and copy
              the files and directories in the list in the new home.
              The files and directories in the list must be expressed as
              relative to the current user's home directory.  All
              modifications are discarded when the sandbox is closed.

       <b>private-opt file,directory</b>
              Build a new /opt in a temporary filesystem, and copy the
              files and directories in the list.  The files and
              directories in the list must be expressed as relative to
              the /opt directory, and must not contain the / character
              (e.g., /opt/foo must be expressed as foo, but /opt/foo/bar
              -- expressed as foo/bar -- is disallowed).  All
              modifications are discarded when the sandbox is closed.

       <b>private-srv file,directory</b>
              Build a new /srv in a temporary filesystem, and copy the
              files and directories in the list.  The files and
              directories in the list must be expressed as relative to
              the /srv directory, and must not contain the / character
              (e.g., /srv/foo must be expressed as foo, but /srv/foo/bar
              -- expressed as foo/bar -- is disallowed).  All
              modifications are discarded when the sandbox is closed.

       <b>private-tmp</b>
              Mount an empty temporary filesystem on top of /tmp
              directory whitelisting /tmp/.X11-unix.

       <b>read-only file_or_directory</b>
              Make directory or file read-only.

       <b>read-write file_or_directory</b>
              Make directory or file read-write.

       <b>tmpfs directory</b>
              Mount an empty tmpfs filesystem on top of directory.
              Directories outside user home or not owned by the user are
              not allowed. Sandboxes running as root are exempt from
              these restrictions.

       <b>tracelog</b>
              Blacklist violations logged to syslog.

       <b>whitelist file_or_directory</b>
              Whitelist directory or file. A temporary file system is
              mounted on the top directory, and the whitelisted files
              are mount-binded inside. Modifications to whitelisted
              files are persistent, everything else is discarded when
              the sandbox is closed. The top directory can be all
              directories in / (except /proc and /sys), /sys/module,
              /run/user/$UID, $HOME and all directories in /usr.

              Symbolic link handling: with the exception of user home,
              both the link and the real file should be in the same top
              directory. For user home, both the link and the real file
              should be owned by the user.

       <b>whitelist-ro file_or_directory</b>
              Equivalent to "whitelist file_or_directory" followed by
              "read-only file_or_directory"

       <b>writable-etc</b>
              Mount /etc directory read-write.

       <b>writable-run-user</b>
              Disable the default blacklisting of run/user/$UID/systemd
              and /run/user/$UID/gnupg.

       <b>writable-var</b>
              Mount /var directory read-write.

       <b>writable-var-log</b>
              Use the real /var/log directory, not a clone. By default,
              a tmpfs is mounted on top of /var/log directory, and a
              skeleton filesystem is created based on the original
              /var/log.

Security filters </h2>
<pre>
       The following security filters are currently implemented:

       <b>allow-debuggers</b>
              Allow tools such as strace and gdb inside the sandbox by

DBus filtering </h2>
<pre>
       Access to the session and system DBus UNIX sockets can be
       allowed, filtered or disabled. To disable the abstract sockets
       (and force applications to use the filtered UNIX socket) you
       would need to request a new network namespace using --net
       command. Another option is to remove unix from the --protocol
       set.

       Filtering requires installing the xdg-dbus-proxy utility. Filter
       rules can be specified for well-known DBus names, but they are
       also propagated to the owning unique name, too. The permissions
       are "sticky" and are kept even if the corresponding well-known
       name is released (however, applications rarely release well-known
       names in practice). Names may have a .* suffix to match all names
       underneath them, including themselves (e.g. "foo.bar.*" matches
       "foo.bar", "foo.bar.baz" and "foo.bar.baz.quux", but not
       "foobar"). For more information, see xdg-dbus-proxy(1).

       <b>dns address</b>
              Set a DNS server for the sandbox. Up to three DNS servers
              can be defined.

       <b>hostname name</b>
              Set a hostname for the sandbox.

       <b>hosts-file file</b>
              Use file as /etc/hosts.

       <b>ip address</b>
              Assign IP addresses to the last network interface defined
              by a net command. A default gateway is assigned by
              default.

              Example:
              net eth0
              ip 10.10.20.56

       <b>ip none</b>
              No IP address and no default gateway are configured for
              the last interface defined by a net command. Use this
              option in case you intend to start an external DHCP client
              in the sandbox.

              Example:
              net eth0
              ip none

       <b>ip dhcp</b>
              Acquire an IP address and default gateway for the last
              interface defined by a net command, as well as set the DNS
              servers according to the DHCP response.  This command
              requires the ISC dhclient DHCP client to be installed and
              will start it automatically inside the sandbox.

              Example:
              net br0
              ip dhcp

              This command should not be used in conjunction with the
              dns command if the DHCP server is set to configure DNS
              servers for the clients, because the manually specified
              DNS servers will be overwritten.

              The DHCP client will NOT release the DHCP lease when the
              sandbox terminates.  If your DHCP server requires leases
              to be explicitly released, consider running a DHCP client
              and releasing the lease manually in conjunction with the
              net none command.

       <b>ip6 address</b>
              Assign IPv6 addresses to the last network interface
              defined by a net command.

              Example:
              net eth0
              ip6 2001:0db8:0:f101::1/64

       <b>ip6 dhcp</b>
              Acquire an IPv6 address and default gateway for the last
              interface defined by a net command, as well as set the DNS
              servers according to the DHCP response.  This command
              requires the ISC dhclient DHCP client to be installed and
              will start it automatically inside the sandbox.

              Example:
              net br0
              ip6 dhcp

              This command should not be used in conjunction with the
              dns command if the DHCP server is set to configure DNS
              servers for the clients, because the manually specified
              DNS servers will be overwritten.

              The DHCP client will NOT release the DHCP lease when the
              sandbox terminates.  If your DHCP server requires leases
              to be explicitly released, consider running a DHCP client
              and releasing the lease manually.

       <b>iprange address,address</b>
              Assign an IP address in the provided range to the last
              network interface defined by a net command.  A default
              gateway is assigned by default.

              Example:

              net eth0
              iprange 192.168.1.150,192.168.1.160

       <b>mac address</b>
              Assign MAC addresses to the last network interface defined
              by a net command.

       <b>mtu number</b>
              Assign a MTU value to the last network interface defined
              by a net command.

       <b>net bridge_interface</b>
              Enable a new network namespace and connect it to this
              bridge interface.  Unless specified with option --ip and
              --defaultgw, an IP address and a default gateway will be
              assigned automatically to the sandbox. The IP address is
              verified using ARP before assignment. The address
              configured as default gateway is the bridge device IP
              address. Up to four --net bridge devices can be defined.
              Mixing bridge and macvlan devices is allowed.

       <b>net ethernet_interface|wireless_interface</b>
              Enable a new network namespace and connect it to this
              ethernet interface using the standard Linux macvlan or
              ipvlan driver. Unless specified with option --ip and
              --defaultgw, an IP address and a default gateway will be
              assigned automatically to the sandbox. The IP address is
              verified using ARP before assignment. The address
              configured as default gateway is the default gateway of
              the host. Up to four --net devices can be defined. Mixing
              bridge and macvlan devices is allowed.

       <b>net none</b>
              Enable a new, unconnected network namespace. The only
              interface available in the new namespace is a new loopback
              interface (lo).  Use this option to deny network access to

              driver.  If the tap interface is not configured, the
              sandbox will not try to configure the interface inside the
              sandbox.  Please use ip, netmask and defaultgw to specify
              the configuration.

       <b>netfilter</b>
              If a new network namespace is created, enabled default
              network filter.

       <b>netfilter filename</b>
              If a new network namespace is created, enabled the network
              filter in filename.

       <b>netlock</b>
              Generate a custom network filter and enable it.

       <b>netmask address</b>
              Use this option when you want to assign an IP address in a
              new namespace and the parent interface specified by --net
              is not configured. An IP address and a default gateway
              address also have to be added.

       <b>netns namespace</b>
              Run the program in a named, persistent network namespace.
              These can be created and configured using "ip netns".

       <b>veth-name name</b>
              Use this name for the interface connected to the bridge
              for --net=bridge_interface commands, instead of the
              default one.

Other </h2>
<pre>
       <b>deterministic-exit-code</b>
              Always exit firejail with the first child's exit status.
              The default behavior is to use the exit status of the
              final child to exit, which can be nondeterministic.

       <b>deterministic-shutdown</b>
              Always shut down the sandbox after the first child has
              terminated. The default behavior is to keep the sandbox
              alive as long as it contains running processes.

       <b>join-or-start sandboxname</b>
              Join the sandbox identified by name or start a new one.
              Same as "firejail --join=sandboxname" command if sandbox
              with specified name exists, otherwise same as "name
              sandboxname".
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>

              profiles for each application supported by default.

       <b>$HOME/.config/firejail/appname.profile</b>
              User application profiles, will take precedence over the
              global profiles.

       <b>/usr/share/doc/firejail/profile.template</b>
              Template for building new profiles.
