NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-dds - Dynamic Directory Services overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>dds </b>overlay to <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> implements dynamic objects as per RFC
       2589.  The name <b>dds </b>stands for Dynamic Directory Services.  It
       allows one to define dynamic objects, characterized by the
       <b>dynamicObject </b>objectClass.

       Dynamic objects have a limited lifetime, determined by a time-to-
       live (TTL) that can be refreshed by means of a specific <b>refresh</b>
       extended operation.  This operation allows one to set the Client
       Refresh Period (CRP), namely the period between refreshes that is
       required to preserve the dynamic object from expiration.  The
       expiration time is computed by adding the requested TTL to the
       current time.  When dynamic objects reach the end of their
       lifetime without being further refreshed, they are automatically
       deleted.  There is no guarantee of immediate deletion, so clients
       should not count on it.

       Dynamic objects can have subordinates, provided these also are
       dynamic objects.  RFC 2589 does not specify what the behavior of
       a dynamic directory service should be when a dynamic object with
       (dynamic) subordinates expires.  In this implementation, the
       lifetime of dynamic objects with subordinates is prolonged until
       all the dynamic subordinates expire.

       This <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> directive adds the <b>dds </b>overlay to the current
       database:

       <b>overlay dds</b>

       The database must have a <b>rootdn </b>specified, otherwise, the <b>dds</b>
       overlay will not be able to delete expired objects. The <b>dds</b>
       overlay may be used with any backend that implements the <b>add</b>,
       <b>modify</b>, <b>search</b>, and <b>delete </b>operations.  Since its use may result
       in many internal entry lookups, adds and deletes, it should be
       best used in conjunction with backends that have reasonably good
       write performances.

       The config directives that are specific to the <b>dds </b>overlay are
       prefixed by <b>dds-</b>, to avoid potential conflicts with directives
       specific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.

       <b>dds-max-ttl &lt;time&gt;</b>
              Specifies the max TTL value.  This is also the default TTL
              newly created dynamic objects receive, unless
              <b>dds-default-ttl </b>is set.  When the client with a refresh
              extended operation requests a TTL higher than it,
              sizeLimitExceeded is returned.  This value must be between
              86400 (1 day, the default) and 31557600 (1 year plus 6
              hours, as per RFC 2589).

       <b>dds-min-ttl &lt;time&gt;</b>
              Specifies the min TTL value; clients requesting a lower
              TTL by means of the refresh extended operation actually
              obtain this value as CRP.  If set to 0 (the default), no
              lower limit is set.

       <b>dds-default-ttl &lt;time&gt;</b>
              Specifies the default TTL value that newly created dynamic
              objects get.  If set to 0 (the default), the <b>dds-max-ttl</b>
              is used.

       <b>dds-interval &lt;time&gt;</b>
              Specifies the interval between expiration checks; defaults
              to 1 hour.

       <b>dds-tolerance &lt;time&gt;</b>
              Specifies an extra time that is added to the timer that
              actually wakes up the thread that will delete an expired
              dynamic object.  So the nominal lifetime of the entry is
              that specified in the <b>entryTtl </b>attribute, but its lifetime
              will actually be <b>entryTtl + tolerance</b>.  Note that there is
              no guarantee that the lifetime of a dynamic object will be
              <i>exactly</i> the requested TTL; due to implementation details,
              it may be longer, which is allowed by RFC 2589.  By
              default, tolerance is 0.

       <b>dds-max-dynamicObjects &lt;num&gt;</b>
              Specifies the maximum number of dynamic objects that can
              simultaneously exist within a naming context.  This allows
              one to limit the amount of resources (mostly in terms of
              run-queue size) that are used by dynamic objects.  By
              default, no limit is set.

       <b>dds-state {TRUE|false}</b>
              Specifies if the Dynamic Directory Services feature is
              enabled or not.  By default it is; however, a proxy does
              not need to keep track of dynamic objects itself, it only
              needs to inform the frontend that support for dynamic
              objects is available.
</pre> <h2>
ACCESS CONTROL </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>dds </b>overlay restricts the refresh operation by requiring
       <b>manage </b>access to the <b>entryTtl </b>attribute (see <a href="slapd.access.5.html">slapd.access(5)</a> for
       details about the <b>manage </b>access privilege).  Since the <b>entryTtl</b>
       is an operational, NO-USER-MODIFICATION attribute, no direct
       write access to it is possible.  So the <b>dds </b>overlay turns refresh
       extended operation into an internal modification to the value of
       the <b>entryTtl </b>attribute with the <b>relax </b>control set.

       RFC 2589 recommends that anonymous clients should not be allowed
       to refresh a dynamic object.  This can be implemented by
       appropriately crafting access control to obtain the desired
       effect.

       Example: restrict refresh to authenticated clients

              access to attrs=entryTtl
                   by users manage
                   by * read

       Example: restrict refresh to the creator of the dynamic object

              access to attrs=entryTtl
                   by dnattr=creatorsName manage
                   by * read

       Another suggested usage of dynamic objects is to implement
       dynamic meetings; in this case, all the participants to the
       meeting are allowed to refresh the meeting object, but only the
       creator can delete it (otherwise it will be deleted when the TTL
       expires)

       Example: assuming <i>participant</i> is a valid DN-valued attribute,
       allow users to start a meeting and to join it; restrict refresh
       to the participants; restrict delete to the creator

              access to dn.base="cn=Meetings"
                        attrs=children
                   by users write

              access to dn.onelevel="cn=Meetings"
                        attrs=entry
                   by dnattr=creatorsName write
                   by * read

              access to dn.onelevel="cn=Meetings"
                        attrs=participant
                   by dnattr=creatorsName write
                   by users selfwrite
                   by * read

              access to dn.onelevel="cn=Meetings"
                        attrs=entryTtl
                   by dnattr=participant manage
                   by * read
</pre> <h2>
REPLICATION </h2>
<pre>
       This implementation of RFC 2589 provides a restricted
       interpretation of how dynamic objects replicate.  Only the
       provider takes care of handling dynamic object expiration, while
       consumers simply see the dynamic object as a plain object.

       When replicating these objects, one needs to explicitly exclude
       the <b>dynamicObject </b>class and the <b>entryTtl </b>attribute.  This
       implementation of RFC 2589 introduces a new operational
       attribute, <b>entryExpireTimestamp</b>, that contains the expiration
       timestamp.  This must be excluded from replication as well.

       The quick and dirty solution is to set <b>schemacheck=off </b>in the
       syncrepl configuration and, optionally, exclude the operational
       attributes from replication, using

              syncrepl ...
                   exattrs=entryTtl,entryExpireTimestamp

       In any case the overlay must be either statically built in or
       run-time loaded by the consumer, so that it is aware of the
       <b>entryExpireTimestamp </b>operational attribute; however, it must not
       be configured in the shadow database.  Currently, there is no
       means to remove the <b>dynamicObject </b>class from the entry; this may
       be seen as a feature, since it allows one to see the dynamic
       properties of the object.
