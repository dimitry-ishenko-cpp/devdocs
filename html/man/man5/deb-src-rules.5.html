NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-src-rules - Debian source package rules file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debian/rules</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This file contains the instructions necessary to build the binary
       packages from the source package.

       The <i>debian/rules</i> file is an executable Makefile, with a shebang
       that is usually set to "#!/usr/bin/make -f".

       It must support the following make targets:

       <b>clean</b>
           Clean up the source tree, by undoing any change done by any
           of the build and binary targets.  This target will be called
           with root privileges.

       <b>build-indep</b>
           Build architecture independent files required to build any
           architecture independent binary package.  If there are no
           architecture independent binary packages to generate, the
           target must still exist but do nothing.  This target must not
           require root privileges.

       <b>build-arch</b>
           Build architecture dependent files required to build any
           architecture dependent binary package.  If there are no
           architecture dependent binary packages to generate, the
           target must still exist but do nothing.  This target must not
           require root privileges.

       <b>build</b>
           Build architecture independent and dependent files, either by
           depending (at least transitively) on <b>build-indep </b>and/or
           <b>build-arch </b>or by inlining what those targets would do.  This
           target must not require root privileges.

       <b>binary-indep</b>
           Build architecture independent binary packages.  This target
           must depend (at least transitively) on either <b>build-indep </b>or
           <b>build</b>.  This target will be called with root privileges.

       <b>binary-arch</b>
           Build architecture dependent binary packages.  This target
           must depend (at least transitively) on either <b>build-arch </b>or
           <b>build</b>.  This target will be called with root privileges.

       <b>binary</b>
           Build architecture independent and dependent binary packages,
           either by depending (at least transitively) on <b>binary-indep</b>
           and/or <b>binary-arch </b>or by inlining what those targets would
           do.  This target will be called with root privileges.
