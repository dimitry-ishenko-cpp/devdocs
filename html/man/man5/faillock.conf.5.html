</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       faillock.conf - pam_faillock configuration file
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>faillock.conf </b>provides a way to configure the default settings
       for locking the user after multiple failed authentication
       attempts. This file is read by the <i>pam_faillock</i> module and is the
       preferred method over configuring <i>pam_faillock</i> directly.

       The file has a very simple <i>name = value</i> format with possible
       comments starting with <i>#</i> character. The whitespace at the
       beginning of line, end of line, and around the <i>=</i> sign is ignored.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dir=</b><i>/path/to/tally-directory</i>
           The directory where the user files with the failure records
           are kept. The default is /var/run/faillock.

           Note: These files will disappear after reboot on systems
           configured with directory /var/run/faillock mounted on
           virtual memory.

       <b>audit</b>
           Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not
           found.

       <b>silent</b>
           Don't print informative messages to the user. Please note
           that when this option is not used there will be difference in
           the authentication behavior for users which exist on the
           system and non-existing users.

       <b>no_log_info</b>
           Don't log informative messages via <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.

       <b>local_users_only</b>
           Only track failed user authentications attempts for local
           users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP,
           etc.) users. The <a href="../man8/faillock.8.html">faillock(8)</a> command will also no longer
           track user failed authentication attempts. Enabling this
           option will prevent a double-lockout scenario where a user is
           locked out locally and in the centralized mechanism.

       <b>nodelay</b>
           Don't enforce a delay after authentication failures.

       <b>deny=</b><i>n</i>
           Deny access if the number of consecutive authentication
           failures for this user during the recent interval exceeds <i>n</i>.
           The default is 3.

       <b>fail_interval=</b><i>n</i>
           The length of the interval during which the consecutive
           authentication failures must happen for the user account lock
           out is <i>n</i> seconds. The default is 900 (15 minutes).

       <b>unlock_time=</b><i>n</i>
           The access will be re-enabled after <i>n</i> seconds after the lock
           out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value <i>never</i> - the
           access will not be re-enabled without resetting the faillock
           entries by the <a href="../man8/faillock.8.html">faillock(8)</a> command. The default is 600 (10
           minutes).

           Note that the default directory that <i>pam_faillock</i> uses is
           usually cleared on system boot so the access will be also
           re-enabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a
           different tally directory must be set with the <b>dir </b>option.

           Also note that it is usually undesirable to permanently lock
           out users as they can become easily a target of denial of
           service attack unless the usernames are random and kept
           secret to potential attackers.

       <b>even_deny_root</b>
           Root account can become locked as well as regular accounts.

       <b>root_unlock_time=</b><i>n</i>
           This option implies <b>even_deny_root </b>option. Allow access after
           <i>n</i> seconds to root account after the account is locked. In
           case the option is not specified the value is the same as of
           the <b>unlock_time </b>option.

       <b>admin_group=</b><i>name</i>
           If a group name is specified with this option, members of the
           group will be handled by this module the same as the root
           account (the options <b>even_deny_root </b>and <b>root_unlock_time </b>will
           apply to them. By default the option is not set.
