DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_score_adj</i> (since Linux 2.6.36)
              This file can be used to adjust the badness heuristic used
              to select which process gets killed in out-of-memory
              conditions.

              The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate
              task ranging from 0 (never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to
              determine which process is targeted.  The units are
              roughly a proportion along that range of allowed memory
              the process may allocate from, based on an estimation of
              its current memory and swap use.  For example, if a task
              is using all allowed memory, its badness score will be
              1000.  If it is using half of its allowed memory, its
              score will be 500.

              There is an additional factor included in the badness
              score: root processes are given 3% extra memory over other
              tasks.

              The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context in
              which the OOM-killer was called.  If it is due to the
              memory assigned to the allocating task's cpuset being
              exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mems
              assigned to that cpuset (see <a href="../man7/cpuset.7.html">cpuset(7)</a>).  If it is due to
              a mempolicy's node(s) being exhausted, the allowed memory
              represents the set of mempolicy nodes.  If it is due to a
              memory limit (or swap limit) being reached, the allowed
              memory is that configured limit.  Finally, if it is due to
              the entire system being out of memory, the allowed memory
              represents all allocatable resources.

              The value of <i>oom_score_adj</i> is added to the badness score
              before it is used to determine which task to kill.
              Acceptable values range from -1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to
              +1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX).  This allows user space to
              control the preference for OOM-killing, ranging from
              always preferring a certain task or completely disabling
              it from OOM-killing.  The lowest possible value, -1000, is
              equivalent to disabling OOM-killing entirely for that
              task, since it will always report a badness score of 0.

              Consequently, it is very simple for user space to define
              the amount of memory to consider for each task.  Setting
              an <i>oom_score_adj</i> value of +500, for example, is roughly
              equivalent to allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the
              same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller
              resources to use at least 50% more memory.  A value of
              -500, on the other hand, would be roughly equivalent to
              discounting 50% of the task's allowed memory from being
              considered as scoring against the task.

              For backward compatibility with previous kernels,
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_adj</i> can still be used to tune the badness
              score.  Its value is scaled linearly with <i>oom_score_adj</i>.

              Writing to <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_score_adj</i> or <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_adj</i>
              will change the other with its scaled value.

              The <a href="../man1/choom.1.html">choom(1)</a> program provides a command-line interface for
              adjusting the <i>oom_score_adj</i> value of a running process or
              a newly executed command.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_adj</i> (since Linux 2.6.11)
              This file can be used to adjust the score used to select
              which process should be killed in an out-of-memory (OOM)
              situation.  The kernel uses this value for a bit-shift
              operation of the process's <i>oom_score</i> value: valid values
              are in the range -16 to +15, plus the special value -17,
              which disables OOM-killing altogether for this process.  A
              positive score increases the likelihood of this process
              being killed by the OOM-killer; a negative score decreases
              the likelihood.

              The default value for this file is 0; a new process
              inherits its parent's <i>oom_adj</i> setting.  A process must be
              privileged (<b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b>) to update this file,
              although a process can always increase its own <i>oom_adj</i>
              setting (since Linux 2.6.20).

              Since Linux 2.6.36, use of this file is deprecated in
              favor of <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_score_adj</i>, and finally removed in
              Linux 3.7.
