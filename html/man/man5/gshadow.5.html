NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gshadow - shadowed group file
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/gshadow contains the shadowed information for group
       accounts.

       This file must not be readable by regular users if password
       security is to be maintained.

       Each line of this file contains the following colon-separated
       fields:

       <b>group name</b>
           It must be a valid group name, which exist on the system.

       <b>encrypted password</b>
           Refer to <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a> for details on how this string is
           interpreted.

           If the password field contains some string that is not a
           valid result of <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a>, for instance ! or *, users will not
           be able to use a unix password to access the group (but group
           members do not need the password).

           The password is used when a user who is not a member of the
           group wants to gain the permissions of this group (see
           <a href="../man1/newgrp.1.html">newgrp(1)</a>).

           This field may be empty, in which case only the group members
           can gain the group permissions.

           A password field which starts with an exclamation mark means
           that the password is locked. The remaining characters on the
           line represent the password field before the password was
           locked.

           This password supersedes any password specified in
           /etc/group.

       <b>administrators</b>
           It must be a comma-separated list of user names.

           Administrators can change the password or the members of the
           group.

           Administrators also have the same permissions as the members
           (see below).

       <b>members</b>
           It must be a comma-separated list of user names.

           Members can access the group without being prompted for a
           password.

           You should use the same list of users as in /etc/group.
