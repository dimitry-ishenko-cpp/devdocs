NAME </h2>

       /proc/pid/oom_score - OOM-killer score
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_score</i> (since Linux 2.6.11)
              This file displays the current score that the kernel gives
              to this process for the purpose of selecting a process for
              the OOM-killer.  A higher score means that the process is
              more likely to be selected by the OOM-killer.  The basis
              for this score is the amount of memory used by the
              process, with increases (+) or decreases (-) for factors
              including:

              •  whether the process is privileged (-).

              Before Linux 2.6.36 the following factors were also used
              in the calculation of oom_score:

              •  whether the process creates a lot of children using
                 <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> (+);

              •  whether the process has been running a long time, or
                 has used a lot of CPU time (-);

              •  whether the process has a low nice value (i.e., &gt; 0)
                 (+); and

              •  whether the process is making direct hardware access
                 (-).

              The <i>oom_score</i> also reflects the adjustment specified by
              the <i>oom_score_adj</i> or <i>oom_adj</i> setting for the process.
