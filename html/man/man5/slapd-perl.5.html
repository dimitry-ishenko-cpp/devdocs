NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapd-perl - Perl backend to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Perl backend to <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> works by embedding a <b>perl</b>(1)
       interpreter into <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a>.  Any perl database section of the
       configuration file <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> must then specify what Perl
       module to use.  <b>Slapd </b>then creates a new Perl object that handles
       all the requests for that particular instance of the backend.

       You will need to create a method for each one of the following
       actions:

         * new        # creates a new object,
         * search     # performs the ldap search,
         * compare    # does a compare,
         * modify     # modifies an entry,
         * add        # adds an entry to backend,
         * modrdn     # modifies an entry's rdn,
         * delete     # deletes an ldap entry,
         * config     # module-specific config directives,
         * init       # called after backend is initialized.

       Unless otherwise specified, the methods return the result code
       which will be returned to the client.  Unimplemented actions can
       just return unwillingToPerform (53).

       <b>new    </b>This method is called when the configuration file
              encounters a <b>perlmod </b>line.  The module in that line is
              then effectively `use'd into the perl interpreter, then
              the <b>new </b>method is called to create a new object.  Note
              that multiple instances of that object may be
              instantiated, as with any perl object.  The <b>new </b>method
              receives the class name as argument.

       <b>search </b>This method is called when a search request comes from a
              client.  It arguments are as follows:
                * object reference
                * base DN
                * scope
                * alias dereferencing policy
                * size limit
                * time limit
                * filter string
                * attributes only flag (1 for yes)
                * list of attributes to return (may be empty)

       Return value: (resultcode, ldif-entry, ldif-entry, ...)

       <b>compare</b>
              This method is called when a compare request comes from a
              client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * attribute assertion string

       <b>modify </b>This method is called when a modify request comes from a
              client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * a list formatted as follows
                  ({ "ADD" | "DELETE" | "REPLACE" },
                   attributetype, value...)...

       <b>add    </b>This method is called when a add request comes from a
              client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * entry in string format

       <b>modrdn </b>This method is called when a modrdn request comes from a
              client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * new rdn
                * delete old dn flag (1 means yes)

       <b>delete </b>This method is called when a delete request comes from a
              client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn

       <b>config </b>This method is called once for each perlModuleConfig line
              in the <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> configuration file.  Its arguments
              are as follows.
                * object reference
                * array of arguments on line

       Return value: nonzero if this is not a valid option.

       <b>init   </b>This method is called after backend is initialized.  Its
              argument is as follows.
                * object reference

       Return value: nonzero if initialization failed.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf </b>options apply to the PERL backend database.
       That is, they must follow a "database perl" line and come before
       any subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database
       options are described in the <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> manual page.

       <b>perlModulePath /path/to/libs</b>
              Add the path to the @INC variable.

       <b>perlModule ModName</b>
              `Use' the module name ModName from ModName.pm

       <b>filterSearchResults</b>
              Search results are candidates that need to be filtered
              (with the filter in the search request), rather than
              search results to be returned directly to the client.

       <b>perlModuleConfig &lt;arguments&gt;</b>
              Invoke the module's config method with the given
              arguments.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       There is an example Perl module `SampleLDAP' in the
       slapd/back-perl/ directory in the OpenLDAP source tree.
</pre> <h2>
ACCESS CONTROL </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>perl </b>backend does not honor any of the access control
       semantics described in <a href="slapd.access.5.html">slapd.access(5)</a>; all access control is
       delegated to the underlying PERL scripting.  Only <b>read (=r)</b>
       access to the <b>entry </b>pseudo-attribute and to the other attribute
       values of the entries returned by the <b>search </b>operation is
       honored, which is performed by the frontend.
</pre> <h2>
WARNING </h2>
<pre>
       The interface of this backend to the perl module MAY change.  Any
       suggestions would greatly be appreciated.

       Note: in previous versions, any unrecognized lines in the
       slapd.conf file were passed to the perl module's config method.
       This behavior is deprecated (but still allowed for backward
       compatibility), and the perlModuleConfig directive should instead
       be used to invoke the module's config method. This compatibility
       feature will be removed at some future date.
