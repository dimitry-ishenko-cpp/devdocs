NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapd.conf - configuration file for slapd, the stand-alone LDAP
       daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The file <b>ETCDIR/slapd.conf </b>contains configuration information for
       the <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> daemon.  This configuration file is also used by the
       SLAPD tools <a href="../man8/slapacl.8.html">slapacl(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapadd.8.html">slapadd(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapauth.8.html">slapauth(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapcat.8.html">slapcat(8)</a>,
       <a href="../man8/slapdn.8.html">slapdn(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapindex.8.html">slapindex(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapmodify.8.html">slapmodify(8)</a>, and <a href="../man8/slaptest.8.html">slaptest(8)</a>.

       The <b>slapd.conf </b>file consists of a series of global configuration
       options that apply to <b>slapd </b>as a whole (including all backends),
       followed by zero or more database backend definitions that
       contain information specific to a backend instance.  The
       configuration options are case-insensitive; their value, on a
       case by case basis, may be case-sensitive.

       The general format of <b>slapd.conf </b>is as follows:

           # comment - these options apply to every database
           &lt;global configuration options&gt;
           # first database definition &amp; configuration options
           database &lt;backend 1 type&gt;
           &lt;configuration options specific to backend 1&gt;
           # subsequent database definitions &amp; configuration options
           ...

       As many backend-specific sections as desired may be included.
       Global options can be overridden in a backend (for options that
       appear more than once, the last appearance in the <b>slapd.conf </b>file
       is used).

       If a line begins with white space, it is considered a
       continuation of the previous line.  No physical line should be
       over 2000 bytes long.

       Blank lines and comment lines beginning with a `#' character are
       ignored.  Note: continuation lines are unwrapped before comment
       processing is applied.

       Arguments on configuration lines are separated by white space. If
       an argument contains white space, the argument should be enclosed
       in double quotes.  If an argument contains a double quote (`"')
       or a backslash character (`\'), the character should be preceded
       by a backslash character.

       The specific configuration options available are discussed below
       in the Global Configuration Options, General Backend Options, and
       General Database Options.  Backend-specific options are discussed
       in the <b>slapd-&lt;backend&gt;</b>(5) manual pages.  Refer to the "OpenLDAP
       Administrator's Guide" for more details on the slapd
       configuration file.
</pre> <h2>
GLOBAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Options described in this section apply to all backends, unless
       specifically overridden in a backend definition. Arguments that
       should be replaced by actual text are shown in brackets &lt;&gt;.

       <b>access to &lt;what&gt; [ by &lt;who&gt; &lt;access&gt; &lt;control&gt; ]+</b>
              Grant access (specified by &lt;access&gt;) to a set of entries
              and/or attributes (specified by &lt;what&gt;) by one or more
              requestors (specified by &lt;who&gt;).  If no access controls
              are present, the default policy allows anyone and everyone
              to read anything but restricts updates to rootdn.  (e.g.,
              "access to * by * read").  The rootdn can always read and
              write EVERYTHING!  See <a href="slapd.access.5.html">slapd.access(5)</a> and the "OpenLDAP's
              Administrator's Guide" for details.

       <b>allow &lt;features&gt;</b>
              Specify a set of features (separated by white space) to
              allow (default none).  <b>bind_v2 </b>allows acceptance of LDAPv2
              bind requests.  Note that <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> does not truly
              implement LDAPv2 (RFC 1777), now Historic (RFC 3494).
              <b>bind_anon_cred </b>allows anonymous bind when credentials are
              not empty (e.g.  when DN is empty).  <b>bind_anon_dn </b>allows
              unauthenticated (anonymous) bind when DN is not empty.
              <b>update_anon </b>allows unauthenticated (anonymous) update
              operations to be processed (subject to access controls and
              other administrative limits).  <b>proxy_authz_anon </b>allows
              unauthenticated (anonymous) proxy authorization control to
              be processed (subject to access controls, authorization
              and other administrative limits).

       <b>argsfile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              The (absolute) name of a file that will hold the <b>slapd</b>
              server's command line (program name and options).

       <b>attributeoptions [option-name]...</b>
              Define tagging attribute options or option tag/range
              prefixes.  Options must not end with `-', prefixes must
              end with `-'.  The `lang-' prefix is predefined.  If you
              use the <b>attributeoptions </b>directive, `lang-' will no longer
              be defined and you must specify it explicitly if you want
              it defined.

              An attribute description with a tagging option is a
              subtype of that attribute description without the option.
              Except for that, options defined this way have no special
              semantics.  Prefixes defined this way work like the
              `lang-' options: They define a prefix for tagging options
              starting with the prefix.  That is, if you define the
              prefix `x-foo-', you can use the option `x-foo-bar'.
              Furthermore, in a search or compare, a prefix or range
              name (with a trailing `-') matches all options starting
              with that name, as well as the option with the range name
              sans the trailing `-'.  That is, `x-foo-bar-' matches
              `x-foo-bar' and `x-foo-bar-baz'.

              RFC 4520 reserves options beginning with `x-' for private
              experiments.  Other options should be registered with
              IANA, see RFC 4520 section 3.5.  OpenLDAP also has the
              `binary' option built in, but this is a transfer option,
              not a tagging option.

       <b>attributetype ( &lt;oid&gt; [NAME &lt;name&gt;] [DESC &lt;description&gt;]</b>
              <b>[OBSOLETE] [SUP &lt;oid&gt;] [EQUALITY &lt;oid&gt;] [ORDERING &lt;oid&gt;]</b>
              <b>[SUBSTR &lt;oid&gt;] [SYNTAX &lt;oidlen&gt;] [SINGLE-VALUE]</b>
              <b>[COLLECTIVE] [NO-USER-MODIFICATION]</b>
              <b>[USAGE &lt;attributeUsage&gt;] )</b>
              Specify an attribute type using the LDAPv3 syntax defined
              in RFC 4512.  The slapd parser extends the RFC 4512
              definition by allowing string forms as well as numeric
              OIDs to be used for the attribute OID and attribute syntax
              OID.  (See the <b>objectidentifier </b>description.)

       <b>authid-rewrite&lt;cmd&gt; &lt;args&gt;</b>
              Used by the authentication framework to convert simple
              user names to an LDAP DN used for authorization purposes.
              Its purpose is analogous to that of <b>authz-regexp </b>(see
              below).  The prefix <i>authid-</i> is followed by a set of rules
              analogous to those described in <a href="slapo-rwm.5.html">slapo-rwm(5)</a> for data
              rewriting (replace the <i>rwm-</i> prefix with <i>authid-</i>).
              <b>authid-rewrite&lt;cmd&gt; </b>and <b>authz-regexp </b>rules should not be
              intermixed.

       <b>authz-policy &lt;policy&gt;</b>
              Used to specify which rules to use for Proxy
              Authorization.  Proxy authorization allows a client to
              authenticate to the server using one user's credentials,
              but specify a different identity to use for authorization
              and access control purposes. It essentially allows user A
              to login as user B, using user A's password.  The <b>none</b>
              flag disables proxy authorization. This is the default
              setting.  The <b>from </b>flag will use rules in the <i>authzFrom</i>
              attribute of the authorization DN.  The <b>to </b>flag will use
              rules in the <i>authzTo</i> attribute of the authentication DN.
              The <b>any </b>flag, an alias for the deprecated value of <b>both</b>,
              will allow any of the above, whatever succeeds first
              (checked in <b>to</b>, <b>from </b>sequence.  The <b>all </b>flag requires both
              authorizations to succeed.

              The rules are mechanisms to specify which identities are
              allowed to perform proxy authorization.  The <i>authzFrom</i>
              attribute in an entry specifies which other users are
              allowed to proxy login to this entry. The <i>authzTo</i>
              attribute in an entry specifies which other users this
              user can authorize as.  Use of <i>authzTo</i> rules can be easily
              abused if users are allowed to write arbitrary values to
              this attribute.  In general the <i>authzTo</i> attribute must be
              protected with ACLs such that only privileged users can
              modify it.  The value of <i>authzFrom</i> and <i>authzTo</i> describes
              an <b>identity </b>or a set of identities; it can take five
              forms:

                     <b>ldap:///&lt;base&gt;??[&lt;scope&gt;]?&lt;filter&gt;</b>
                     <b>dn[.&lt;dnstyle&gt;]:&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
                     <b>u[.&lt;mech&gt;[/&lt;realm&gt;]]:&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
                     <b>group[/objectClass[/attributeType]]:&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
                     <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>

                     <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt;:={exact|onelevel|children|subtree|regex}</b>

              The first form is a valid LDAP <b>URI </b>where the
              <i>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</i>, the <i>&lt;attrs&gt;</i> and the <i>&lt;extensions&gt;</i> portions
              must be absent, so that the search occurs locally on
              either <i>authzFrom</i> or <i>authzTo</i>.

              The second form is a <b>DN</b>.  The optional <b>dnstyle </b>modifiers
              <i>exact</i>, <i>onelevel</i>, <i>children</i>, and <i>subtree</i> provide exact,
              onelevel, children and subtree matches, which cause
              <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> to be normalized according to the DN
              normalization rules.  The special <b>dnstyle </b>modifier <i>regex</i>
              causes the <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> to be treated as a POSIX
              (''extended'') regular expression, as discussed in
              <a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex(7)</a> and/or <b>re_format</b>(7).  A pattern of <i>*</i> means any
              non-anonymous DN.

              The third form is a SASL <b>id</b>.  The optional fields <i>&lt;mech&gt;</i>
              and <i>&lt;realm&gt;</i> allow specification of a SASL <b>mechanism</b>, and
              eventually a SASL <b>realm</b>, for those mechanisms that support
              one.  The need to allow the specification of a mechanism
              is still debated, and users are strongly discouraged to
              rely on this possibility.

              The fourth form is a group specification.  It consists of
              the keyword <b>group</b>, optionally followed by the
              specification of the group <b>objectClass </b>and <b>attributeType</b>.
              The <b>objectClass </b>defaults to <i>groupOfNames</i>.  The
              <b>attributeType </b>defaults to <i>member</i>.  The group with DN
              <b>&lt;pattern&gt; </b>is searched with base scope, filtered on the
              specified <b>objectClass</b>.  The values of the resulting
              <b>attributeType </b>are searched for the asserted DN.

              The fifth form is provided for backwards compatibility.
              If no identity type is provided, i.e. only <b>&lt;pattern&gt; </b>is
              present, an <i>exact DN</i> is assumed; as a consequence,
              <b>&lt;pattern&gt; </b>is subjected to DN normalization.

              Since the interpretation of <i>authzFrom</i> and <i>authzTo</i> can
              impact security, users are strongly encouraged to
              explicitly set the type of identity specification that is
              being used.  A subset of these rules can be used as third
              arg in the <b>authz-regexp </b>statement (see below);
              significantly, the <i>URI</i>, provided it results in exactly one
              entry, and the <i>dn.exact:&lt;dn&gt;</i> forms.

       <b>authz-regexp &lt;match&gt; &lt;replace&gt;</b>
              Used by the authentication framework to convert simple
              user names, such as provided by SASL subsystem, or
              extracted from certificates in case of cert-based SASL
              EXTERNAL, or provided within the RFC 4370 "proxied
              authorization" control, to an LDAP DN used for
              authorization purposes.  Note that the resulting DN need
              not refer to an existing entry to be considered valid.
              When an authorization request is received from the SASL
              subsystem, the SASL <b>USERNAME</b>, <b>REALM</b>, and <b>MECHANISM </b>are
              taken, when available, and combined into a name of the
              form

                     <b>UID=&lt;username&gt;[[,CN=&lt;realm&gt;],CN=&lt;mechanism&gt;],CN=auth</b>

              This name is then compared against the <b>match </b>POSIX
              (''extended'') regular expression, and if the match is
              successful, the name is replaced with the <b>replace </b>string.
              If there are wildcard strings in the <b>match </b>regular
              expression that are enclosed in parenthesis, e.g.

                     <b>UID=([^,]*),CN=.*</b>

              then the portion of the name that matched the wildcard
              will be stored in the numbered placeholder variable $1. If
              there are other wildcard strings in parenthesis, the
              matching strings will be in $2, $3, etc. up to $9. The
              placeholders can then be used in the <b>replace </b>string, e.g.

                     <b>UID=$1,OU=Accounts,DC=example,DC=com</b>

              The replaced name can be either a DN, i.e. a string
              prefixed by "dn:", or an LDAP URI.  If the latter, the
              server will use the URI to search its own database(s) and,
              if the search returns exactly one entry, the name is
              replaced by the DN of that entry.   The LDAP URI must have
              no hostport, attrs, or extensions components, but the
              filter is mandatory, e.g.

                     <b>ldap:///OU=Accounts,DC=example,DC=com??one?(UID=$1)</b>

              The protocol portion of the URI must be strictly <b>ldap</b>.
              Note that this search is subject to access controls.
              Specifically, the authentication identity must have "auth"
              access in the subject.

              Multiple <b>authz-regexp </b>options can be given in the
              configuration file to allow for multiple matching and
              replacement patterns. The matching patterns are checked in
              the order they appear in the file, stopping at the first
              successful match.

       <b>concurrency &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify a desired level of concurrency.  Provided to the
              underlying thread system as a hint.  The default is not to
              provide any hint. This setting is only meaningful on some
              platforms where there is not a one to one correspondence
              between user threads and kernel threads.

       <b>conn_max_pending &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum number of pending requests for an
              anonymous session.  If requests are submitted faster than
              the server can process them, they will be queued up to
              this limit. If the limit is exceeded, the session is
              closed. The default is 100.

       <b>conn_max_pending_auth &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum number of pending requests for an
              authenticated session.  The default is 1000.

       <b>defaultsearchbase &lt;dn&gt;</b>
              Specify a default search base to use when client submits a
              non-base search request with an empty base DN.  Base
              scoped search requests with an empty base DN are not
              affected.

       <b>disallow &lt;features&gt;</b>
              Specify a set of features (separated by white space) to
              disallow (default none).  <b>bind_anon </b>disables acceptance of
              anonymous bind requests.  Note that this setting does not
              prohibit anonymous directory access (See "require authc").
              <b>bind_simple </b>disables simple (bind) authentication.
              <b>tls_2_anon </b>disables forcing session to anonymous status
              (see also <b>tls_authc</b>) upon StartTLS operation receipt.
              <b>tls_authc </b>disallows the StartTLS operation if
              authenticated (see also <b>tls_2_anon</b>).
              <b>proxy_authz_non_critical </b>disables acceptance of the
              proxied authorization control (RFC4370) with criticality
              set to FALSE.  <b>dontusecopy_non_critical </b>disables
              acceptance of the dontUseCopy control (a work in progress)
              with criticality set to FALSE.

       <b>ditcontentrule ( &lt;oid&gt; [NAME &lt;name&gt;] [DESC &lt;description&gt;]</b>
              <b>[OBSOLETE] [AUX &lt;oids&gt;] [MUST &lt;oids&gt;] [MAY &lt;oids&gt;]</b>
              <b>[NOT &lt;oids&gt;] )</b>
              Specify an DIT Content Rule using the LDAPv3 syntax
              defined in RFC 4512.  The slapd parser extends the RFC
              4512 definition by allowing string forms as well as
              numeric OIDs to be used for the attribute OID and
              attribute syntax OID.  (See the <b>objectidentifier</b>
              description.)

       <b>gentlehup { on | off }</b>
              A SIGHUP signal will only cause a 'gentle' shutdown-
              attempt: <b>Slapd </b>will stop listening for new connections,
              but will not close the connections to the current clients.
              Future write operations return unwilling-to-perform,
              though.  Slapd terminates when all clients have closed
              their connections (if they ever do), or - as before - if
              it receives a SIGTERM signal.  This can be useful if you
              wish to terminate the server and start a new <b>slapd </b>server
              <b>with another database, </b>without disrupting the currently
              active clients.  The default is off.  You may wish to use
              <b>idletimeout </b>along with this option.

       <b>idletimeout &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly
              closing an idle client connection.  A setting of 0
              disables this feature.  The default is 0. You may also
              want to set the <b>writetimeout </b>option.

       <b>include &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Read additional configuration information from the given
              file before continuing with the next line of the current
              file.

       <b>index_hash64 { on | off }</b>
              Use a 64 bit hash for indexing. The default is to use 32
              bit hashes.  These hashes are used for equality and
              substring indexing. The 64 bit version may be needed to
              avoid index collisions when the number of indexed values
              exceeds ~64 million. (Note that substring indexing
              generates multiple index values per actual attribute
              value.)  Indices generated with 32 bit hashes are
              incompatible with the 64 bit version, and vice versa. Any
              existing databases must be fully reloaded when changing
              this setting. This directive is only supported on 64 bit
              CPUs.

       <b>index_intlen &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the key length for ordered integer indices. The
              most significant bytes of the binary integer will be used
              for index keys. The default value is 4, which provides
              exact indexing for 31 bit values.  A floating point
              representation is used to index too large values.

       <b>index_substr_if_maxlen &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum length for subinitial and subfinal
              indices. Only this many characters of an attribute value
              will be processed by the indexing functions; any excess
              characters are ignored. The default is 4.

       <b>index_substr_if_minlen &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the minimum length for subinitial and subfinal
              indices. An attribute value must have at least this many
              characters in order to be processed by the indexing
              functions. The default is 2.

       <b>index_substr_any_len &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the length used for subany indices. An attribute
              value must have at least this many characters in order to
              be processed. Attribute values longer than this length
              will be processed in segments of this length. The default
              is 4. The subany index will also be used in subinitial and
              subfinal index lookups when the filter string is longer
              than the <i>index_substr_if_maxlen</i> value.

       <b>index_substr_any_step &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the steps used in subany index lookups. This value
              sets the offset for the segments of a filter string that
              are processed for a subany index lookup. The default is 2.
              For example, with the default values, a search using this
              filter "cn=*abcdefgh*" would generate index lookups for
              "abcd", "cdef", and "efgh".

       Note: Indexing support depends on the particular backend in use.
       Also, changing these settings will generally require deleting any
       indices that depend on these parameters and recreating them with
       <a href="../man8/slapindex.8.html">slapindex(8)</a>.

       <b>ldapsyntax ( &lt;oid&gt; [DESC &lt;description&gt;] [X-SUBST &lt;substitute-</b>
              <b>syntax&gt;] )</b>
              Specify an LDAP syntax using the LDAPv3 syntax defined in
              RFC 4512.  The slapd parser extends the RFC 4512
              definition by allowing string forms as well as numeric
              OIDs to be used for the syntax OID.  (See the
              <b>objectidentifier </b>description.)  The slapd parser also
              honors the <b>X-SUBST </b>extension (an OpenLDAP-specific
              extension), which allows one to use the <b>ldapsyntax</b>
              statement to define a non-implemented syntax along with
              another syntax, the extension value <i>substitute-syntax</i>, as
              its temporary replacement.  The <i>substitute-syntax</i> must be
              defined.  This allows one to define attribute types that
              make use of non-implemented syntaxes using the correct
              syntax OID.  Unless <b>X-SUBST </b>is used, this configuration
              statement would result in an error, since no handlers
              would be associated to the resulting syntax structure.

       <b>listener-threads &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the number of threads to use for the connection
              manager.  The default is 1 and this is typically adequate
              for up to 16 CPU cores.  The value should be set to a
              power of 2.

       <b>localSSF &lt;SSF&gt;</b>
              Specifies the Security Strength Factor (SSF) to be given
              local LDAP sessions, such as those to the ldapi://
              listener.  For a description of SSF values, see <b>sasl-</b>
              <b>secprops</b>'s <b>minssf </b>option description.  The default is 71.

       <b>logfile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specify a file for recording slapd debug messages. These
              messages are unrelated to messages exposed by the <b>loglevel</b>
              configuration parameter. This setting only affects the
              slapd daemon and has no effect on the command line tools.
              By default these messages only go to stderr and are not
              recorded anywhere else.  Specifying a logfile copies
              messages to both stderr and the logfile.

       <b>logfile-format debug | syslog-utc | syslog-localtime</b>
              Specify the prefix format for messages written to the
              logfile. The debug format is the normal format used for
              slapd debug messages, with a timestamp in hexadecimal,
              followed by a thread ID.  The other options are to use
              syslog(3) style prefixes, with timestamps either in UTC or
              in the local timezone. The default is debug format.

       <b>logfile-only on | off</b>
              Specify that debug messages should only go to the
              configured logfile, and not to stderr.

       <b>logfile-rotate &lt;max&gt; &lt;Mbytes&gt; &lt;hours&gt;</b>
              Specify automatic rotation for the configured logfile as
              the maximum number of old logfiles to retain, a maximum
              size in megabytes to allow a logfile to grow before
              rotation, and a maximum age in hours for a logfile to be
              used before rotation. The maximum number must be in the
              range 1-99.  Setting Mbytes or hours to zero disables the
              size or age check, respectively.  At least one of Mbytes
              or hours must be non-zero. By default no automatic
              rotation will be performed.

       <b>loglevel &lt;integer&gt; [...]</b>
              Specify the level at which debugging statements and
              operation statistics should be syslogged (currently logged
              to the <b>syslogd</b>(8) LOG_LOCAL4 facility).  They must be
              considered subsystems rather than increasingly verbose log
              levels.  Some messages with higher priority are logged
              regardless of the configured loglevel as soon as any
              logging is configured.  Log levels are additive, and
              available levels are:
                     <b>1      (0x1 trace) </b>trace function calls
                     <b>2      (0x2 packets) </b>debug packet handling
                     <b>4      (0x4 args) </b>heavy trace debugging (function
                            args)
                     <b>8      (0x8 conns) </b>connection management
                     <b>16     (0x10 BER) </b>print out packets sent and
                            received

                     <b>64     (0x40 config) </b>configuration file processing
                     <b>128    (0x80 ACL) </b>access control list processing
                     <b>256    (0x100 stats) </b>connections, LDAP operations,
                            results (recommended)
                     <b>512    (0x200 stats2) </b>stats2 log entries sent

                            whatever log level is set
              The desired log level can be input as a single integer
              that combines the (ORed) desired levels, both in decimal
              or in hexadecimal notation, as a list of integers (that
              are ORed internally), or as a list of the names that are
              shown between parentheses, such that

                  loglevel 129
                  loglevel 0x81
                  loglevel 128 1
                  loglevel 0x80 0x1
                  loglevel acl trace

              are equivalent.  The keyword <b>any </b>can be used as a shortcut
              to enable logging at all levels (equivalent to -1).  The
              keyword <b>none</b>, or the equivalent integer representation,
              causes those messages that are logged regardless of the
              configured loglevel to be logged.  In fact, if loglevel is
              set to 0, no logging occurs, so at least the <b>none </b>level is
              required to have high priority messages logged.

              Note that the <b>packets</b>, <b>BER</b>, and <b>parse </b>levels are only
              available as debug output on stderr, and are not sent to
              syslog.

              The loglevel defaults to <b>stats</b>.  This level should usually
              also be included when using other loglevels, to help
              analyze the logs.

       <b>maxfilterdepth &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum depth of nested filters in search
              requests.  The default is 1000.

       <b>moduleload &lt;filename&gt; [&lt;arguments&gt;...]</b>
              Specify the name of a dynamically loadable module to load
              and any additional arguments if supported by the module.
              The filename may be an absolute path name or a simple
              filename. Non-absolute names are searched for in the
              directories specified by the <b>modulepath </b>option. This
              option and the <b>modulepath </b>option are only usable if slapd
              was compiled with --enable-modules.

       <b>modulepath &lt;pathspec&gt;</b>
              Specify a list of directories to search for loadable
              modules. Typically the path is colon-separated but this
              depends on the operating system.  The default is
              MODULEDIR, which is where the standard OpenLDAP install
              will place its modules.

       <b>objectclass ( &lt;oid&gt; [NAME &lt;name&gt;] [DESC &lt;description&gt;] [OBSOLETE]</b>
              <b>[SUP &lt;oids&gt;] [{ ABSTRACT | STRUCTURAL | AUXILIARY }]</b>
              <b>[MUST &lt;oids&gt;] [MAY &lt;oids&gt;] )</b>
              Specify an objectclass using the LDAPv3 syntax defined in
              RFC 4512.  The slapd parser extends the RFC 4512
              definition by allowing string forms as well as numeric
              OIDs to be used for the object class OID.  (See the
              <b>objectidentifier </b>description.)  Object classes are
              "STRUCTURAL" by default.

       <b>objectidentifier &lt;name&gt; { &lt;oid&gt; | &lt;name&gt;[:&lt;suffix&gt;] }</b>
              Define a string name that equates to the given OID. The
              string can be used in place of the numeric OID in
              objectclass and attribute definitions. The name can also
              be used with a suffix of the form ":xx" in which case the
              value "oid.xx" will be used.

       <b>password-hash &lt;hash&gt; [&lt;hash&gt;...]</b>
              This option configures one or more hashes to be used in
              generation of user passwords stored in the userPassword
              attribute during processing of LDAP Password Modify
              Extended Operations (RFC 3062).  The &lt;hash&gt; must be one of
              <b>{SSHA}</b>, <b>{SHA}</b>, <b>{SMD5}</b>, <b>{MD5}</b>, <b>{CRYPT}</b>, and <b>{CLEARTEXT}</b>.
              The default is <b>{SSHA}</b>.

              <b>{SHA} </b>and <b>{SSHA} </b>use the SHA-1 algorithm (FIPS 160-1), the
              latter with a seed.

              <b>{MD5} </b>and <b>{SMD5} </b>use the MD5 algorithm (RFC 1321), the
              latter with a seed.

              <b>{CRYPT} </b>uses the <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a>.

              <b>{CLEARTEXT} </b>indicates that the new password should be
              added to userPassword as clear text.

              Note that this option does not alter the normal user
              applications handling of userPassword during LDAP Add,
              Modify, or other LDAP operations.

       <b>password-crypt-salt-format &lt;format&gt;</b>
              Specify the format of the salt passed to <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a> when
              generating {CRYPT} passwords (see <b>password-hash</b>) during
              processing of LDAP Password Modify Extended Operations
              (RFC 3062).

              This string needs to be in <a href="../man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf(3)</a> format and may
              include one (and only one) %s conversion.  This conversion
              will be substituted with a string of random characters
              from [A-Za-z0-9./].  For example, "%.2s" provides a two
              character salt and "$1$%.8s" tells some versions of
              crypt(3) to use an MD5 algorithm and provides 8 random
              characters of salt.  The default is "%s", which provides
              31 characters of salt.

       <b>pidfile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              The (absolute) name of a file that will hold the <b>slapd</b>
              server's process ID (see <a href="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid(2)</a>).

       <b>pluginlog: &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              The ( absolute ) name of a file that will contain log
              messages from <b>SLAPI </b>plugins. See <a href="slapd.plugin.5.html">slapd.plugin(5)</a> for
              details.

       <b>referral &lt;url&gt;</b>
              Specify the referral to pass back when <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> cannot
              find a local database to handle a request.  If specified
              multiple times, each url is provided.

       <b>require &lt;conditions&gt;</b>
              Specify a set of conditions (separated by white space) to
              require (default none).  The directive may be specified
              globally and/or per-database; databases inherit global
              conditions, so per-database specifications are additive.
              <b>bind </b>requires bind operation prior to directory
              operations.  <b>LDAPv3 </b>requires session to be using LDAP
              version 3.  <b>authc </b>requires authentication prior to
              directory operations.  <b>SASL </b>requires SASL authentication
              prior to directory operations.  <b>strong </b>requires strong
              authentication prior to directory operations.  The strong
              keyword allows protected "simple" authentication as well
              as SASL authentication.  <b>none </b>may be used to require no
              conditions (useful to clear out globally set conditions
              within a particular database); it must occur first in the
              list of conditions.

       <b>reverse-lookup on | off</b>
              Enable/disable client name unverified reverse lookup
              (default is <b>off </b>if compiled with --enable-rlookups).

       <b>rootDSE &lt;file&gt;</b>
              Specify the name of an LDIF(5) file containing user
              defined attributes for the root DSE.  These attributes are
              returned in addition to the attributes normally produced
              by slapd.

              The root DSE is an entry with information about the server
              and its capabilities, in operational attributes.  It has
              the empty DN, and can be read with e.g.:
                  ldapsearch -x -b "" -s base "+"
              See RFC 4512 section 5.1 for details.

       <b>sasl-auxprops &lt;plugin&gt; [...]</b>
              Specify which auxprop plugins to use for authentication
              lookups. The default is empty, which just uses slapd's
              internal support. Usually no other auxprop plugins are
              needed.

       <b>sasl-auxprops-dontusecopy &lt;attr&gt; [...]</b>
              Specify which attribute(s) should be subject to the don't
              use copy control. This is necessary for some SASL
              mechanisms such as OTP to work in a replicated
              environment. The attribute "cmusaslsecretOTP" is the
              default value.

       <b>sasl-auxprops-dontusecopy-ignore on | off</b>
              Used to disable replication of the attribute(s) defined by
              sasl-auxprops-dontusecopy and instead use a local value
              for the attribute. This allows the SASL mechanism to
              continue to work if the provider is offline. This can
              cause replication inconsistency. Defaults to off.

       <b>sasl-host &lt;fqdn&gt;</b>
              Used to specify the fully qualified domain name used for
              SASL processing.

       <b>sasl-realm &lt;realm&gt;</b>
              Specify SASL realm.  Default is empty.

       <b>sasl-cbinding none | tls-unique | tls-endpoint</b>
              Specify the channel-binding type, see also
              LDAP_OPT_X_SASL_CBINDING.  Default is none.

       <b>sasl-secprops &lt;properties&gt;</b>
              Used to specify Cyrus SASL security properties.  The <b>none</b>
              flag (without any other properties) causes the flag
              properties default, "noanonymous,noplain", to be cleared.
              The <b>noplain </b>flag disables mechanisms susceptible to simple
              passive attacks.  The <b>noactive </b>flag disables mechanisms
              susceptible to active attacks.  The <b>nodict </b>flag disables
              mechanisms susceptible to passive dictionary attacks.  The
              <b>noanonymous </b>flag disables mechanisms which support
              anonymous login.  The <b>forwardsec </b>flag require forward
              secrecy between sessions.  The <b>passcred </b>require mechanisms
              which pass client credentials (and allow mechanisms which
              can pass credentials to do so).  The <b>minssf=&lt;factor&gt;</b>
              property specifies the minimum acceptable <i>security</i>
              <i>strength factor</i> as an integer approximate to effective key
              length used for encryption.  0 (zero) implies no
              protection, 1 implies integrity protection only, 128
              allows RC4, Blowfish and other similar ciphers, 256 will
              require modern ciphers.  The default is 0.  The
              <b>maxssf=&lt;factor&gt; </b>property specifies the maximum acceptable
              <i>security strength factor</i> as an integer (see minssf
              description).  The default is INT_MAX.  The
              <b>maxbufsize=&lt;size&gt; </b>property specifies the maximum security
              layer receive buffer size allowed.  0 disables security
              layers.  The default is 65536.

       <b>schemadn &lt;dn&gt;</b>
              Specify the distinguished name for the subschema subentry
              that controls the entries on this server.  The default is
              "cn=Subschema".

       <b>security &lt;factors&gt;</b>
              Specify a set of security strength factors (separated by
              white space) to require (see <b>sasl-secprops</b>'s <b>minssf </b>option
              for a description of security strength factors).  The
              directive may be specified globally and/or per-database.
              <b>ssf=&lt;n&gt; </b>specifies the overall security strength factor.
              <b>transport=&lt;n&gt; </b>specifies the transport security strength
              factor.  <b>tls=&lt;n&gt; </b>specifies the TLS security strength
              factor.  <b>sasl=&lt;n&gt; </b>specifies the SASL security strength
              factor.  <b>update_ssf=&lt;n&gt; </b>specifies the overall security
              strength factor to require for directory updates.
              <b>update_transport=&lt;n&gt; </b>specifies the transport security
              strength factor to require for directory updates.
              <b>update_tls=&lt;n&gt; </b>specifies the TLS security strength factor
              to require for directory updates.  <b>update_sasl=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              specifies the SASL security strength factor to require for
              directory updates.  <b>simple_bind=&lt;n&gt; </b>specifies the security
              strength factor required for <i>simple</i> username/password
              authentication.  Note that the <b>transport </b>factor is measure
              of security provided by the underlying transport, e.g.
              ldapi:// (and eventually IPSEC).  It is not normally used.

       <b>serverID &lt;integer&gt; [&lt;URL&gt;]</b>
              Specify an integer ID from 0 to 4095 for this server. The
              ID may also be specified as a hexadecimal ID by prefixing
              the value with "0x".  Non-zero IDs are required when using
              multi-provider replication and each provider must have a
              unique non-zero ID. Note that this requirement also
              applies to separate providers contributing to a glued set
              of databases.  If the URL is provided, this directive may
              be specified multiple times, providing a complete list of
              participating servers and their IDs. The fully qualified
              hostname of each server should be used in the supplied
              URLs. The IDs are used in the "replica id" field of all
              CSNs generated by the specified server. The default value
              is zero, which is only valid for single provider
              replication.  Example:

            serverID 1 ldap://ldap1.example.com
            serverID 2 ldap://ldap2.example.com

       <b>sizelimit {&lt;integer&gt;|unlimited}</b>

       <b>sizelimit size[.{soft|hard}]=&lt;integer&gt; [...]</b>
              Specify the maximum number of entries to return from a
              search operation.  The default size limit is 500.  Use
              <b>unlimited </b>to specify no limits.  The second format allows
              a fine grain setting of the size limits.  If no special
              qualifiers are specified, both soft and hard limits are
              set.  Extra args can be added on the same line.
              Additional qualifiers are available; see <b>limits </b>for an
              explanation of all of the different flags.

       <b>sockbuf_max_incoming &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum incoming LDAP PDU size for anonymous
              sessions.  The default is 262143.

       <b>sockbuf_max_incoming_auth &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum incoming LDAP PDU size for
              authenticated sessions.  The default is 4194303.

       <b>sortvals &lt;attr&gt; [...]</b>
              Specify a list of multi-valued attributes whose values
              will always be maintained in sorted order. Using this
              option will allow Modify, Compare, and filter evaluations
              on these attributes to be performed more efficiently. The
              resulting sort order depends on the attributes' syntax and
              matching rules and may not correspond to lexical order or
              any other recognizable order.

       <b>tcp-buffer [listener=&lt;URL&gt;] [{read|write}=]&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Specify the size of the TCP buffer.  A global value for
              both read and write TCP buffers related to any listener is
              defined, unless the listener is explicitly specified, or
              either the read or write qualifiers are used.  See <a href="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp(7)</a>
              for details.  Note that some OS-es implement automatic TCP
              buffer tuning.

       <b>threads &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum size of the primary thread pool.  The
              default is 16; the minimum value is 2.

       <b>threadqueues &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the number of work queues to use for the primary
              thread pool.  The default is 1 and this is typically
              adequate for up to 8 CPU cores.  The value should not
              exceed the number of CPUs in the system.

       <b>timelimit {&lt;integer&gt;|unlimited}</b>

       <b>timelimit time[.{soft|hard}]=&lt;integer&gt; [...]</b>
              Specify the maximum number of seconds (in real time) <b>slapd</b>
              will spend answering a search request.  The default time
              limit is 3600.  Use <b>unlimited </b>to specify no limits.  The
              second format allows a fine grain setting of the time
              limits.  Extra args can be added on the same line.  See
              <b>limits </b>for an explanation of the different flags.

       <b>tool-threads &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum number of threads to use in tool mode.
              This should not be greater than the number of CPUs in the
              system.  The default is 1.

       <b>writetimeout &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly
              closing a connection with an outstanding write. This
              allows recovery from various network hang conditions.  A
              writetimeout of 0 disables this feature.  The default is
              0.
</pre> <h2>
TLS OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       If <b>slapd </b>is built with support for Transport Layer Security,
       there are more options you can specify.

       <b>TLSCipherSuite &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt;</b>
              Permits configuring what ciphers will be accepted and the
              preference order.  &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt; should be a cipher
              specification for the TLS library in use (OpenSSL or
              GnuTLS).  This directive is not supported when using
              MbedTLS.  Example:

                     <i>OpenSSL:</i>
                            TLSCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2

                     <i>GnuTLS:</i>
                            TLSCiphersuite SECURE256:!AES-128-CBC

              To check what ciphers a given spec selects in OpenSSL,
              use:

                   openssl ciphers -v &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt;

              With GnuTLS the available specs can be found in the manual
              page of <a href="../man1/gnutls-cli.1.html">gnutls-cli(1)</a> (see the description of the option
              <b>--priority</b>).

              In older versions of GnuTLS, where gnutls-cli does not
              support the option --priority, you can obtain the — more
              limited — list of ciphers by calling:

                   gnutls-cli -l

       <b>TLSCACertificateFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specifies the file that contains certificates for all of
              the Certificate Authorities that <b>slapd </b>will recognize.
              The certificate for the CA that signed the server
              certificate must(GnuTLS)/may(OpenSSL) be included among
              these certificates. If the signing CA was not a top-level
              (root) CA, certificates for the entire sequence of CA's
              from the signing CA to the top-level CA should be present.
              Multiple certificates are simply appended to the file; the
              order is not significant.

       <b>TLSCACertificatePath &lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specifies the path of directories that contain Certificate
              Authority certificates in separate individual files.
              Usually only one of this or the TLSCACertificateFile is
              used. If both are specified, both locations will be used.
              Multiple directories may be specified, separated by a
              semi-colon.

       <b>TLSCertificateFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specifies the file that contains the <b>slapd </b>server
              certificate.

              When using OpenSSL that file may also contain any number
              of intermediate certificates after the server certificate.

       <b>TLSCertificateKeyFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specifies the file that contains the <b>slapd </b>server private
              key that matches the certificate stored in the
              <b>TLSCertificateFile </b>file.  Currently, the private key must
              not be protected with a password, so it is of critical
              importance that it is protected carefully.

       <b>TLSDHParamFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              This directive specifies the file that contains parameters
              for Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange.  This is
              required in order to use a DSA certificate on the server,
              or an RSA certificate missing the "key encipherment" key
              usage.  Note that setting this option may also enable
              Anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchanges in certain non-
              default cipher suites.  Anonymous key exchanges should
              generally be avoided since they provide no actual client
              or server authentication and provide no protection against
              man-in-the-middle attacks.  You should append "!ADH" to
              your cipher suites to ensure that these suites are not
              used.  This directive is not supported when using MbedTLS.

       <b>TLSECName &lt;name&gt;</b>
              Specify the name of the curve(s) to use for Elliptic curve
              Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange.  This option is
              only used for OpenSSL.  This option is not used with
              GnuTLS; the curves may be chosen in the GnuTLS ciphersuite
              specification.

       <b>TLSProtocolMin &lt;major&gt;[.&lt;minor&gt;]</b>
              Specifies minimum SSL/TLS protocol version that will be
              negotiated.  If the server doesn't support at least that
              version, the SSL handshake will fail.  To require TLS 1.x
              or higher, set this option to 3.(x+1), e.g.,

                   TLSProtocolMin 3.2

              would require TLS 1.1.  Specifying a minimum that is
              higher than that supported by the OpenLDAP implementation
              will result in it requiring the highest level that it does
              support.  This directive is ignored with GnuTLS.

       <b>TLSRandFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specifies the file to obtain random bits from when
              /dev/[u]random is not available.  Generally set to the
              name of the EGD/PRNGD socket.  The environment variable
              RANDFILE can also be used to specify the filename.  This
              directive is ignored with GnuTLS.

       <b>TLSVerifyClient &lt;level&gt;</b>
              Specifies what checks to perform on client certificates in
              an incoming TLS session, if any.  The <b>&lt;level&gt; </b>can be
              specified as one of the following keywords:

              <b>never  </b>This is the default.  <b>slapd </b>will not ask the client
                     for a certificate.

              <b>allow  </b>The client certificate is requested.  If no
                     certificate is provided, the session proceeds
                     normally.  If a bad certificate is provided, it
                     will be ignored and the session proceeds normally.

              <b>try    </b>The client certificate is requested.  If no
                     certificate is provided, the session proceeds
                     normally.  If a bad certificate is provided, the
                     session is immediately terminated.

              <b>demand | hard | true</b>
                     These keywords are all equivalent, for
                     compatibility reasons.  The client certificate is
                     requested.  If no certificate is provided, or a bad
                     certificate is provided, the session is immediately
                     terminated.

                     Note that a valid client certificate is required in
                     order to use the SASL EXTERNAL authentication
                     mechanism with a TLS session.  As such, a non-
                     default <b>TLSVerifyClient </b>setting must be chosen to
                     enable SASL EXTERNAL authentication.

       <b>TLSCRLCheck &lt;level&gt;</b>
              Specifies if the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) of the
              CA should be used to verify if the client certificates
              have not been revoked. This requires <b>TLSCACertificatePath</b>
              parameter to be set. This directive is ignored with
              GnuTLS.  <b>&lt;level&gt; </b>can be specified as one of the following
              keywords:

              <b>none   </b>No CRL checks are performed

              <b>peer   </b>Check the CRL of the peer certificate

              <b>all    </b>Check the CRL for a whole certificate chain

       <b>TLSCRLFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specifies a file containing a Certificate Revocation List
              to be used for verifying that certificates have not been
              revoked. This directive is only valid when using GnuTLS.
</pre> <h2>
GENERAL BACKEND OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Options in this section only apply to the configuration file
       section of all instances of the specified backend.  All backends
       may support this class of options, but currently only back-mdb
       does.

       <b>backend &lt;databasetype&gt;</b>
              Mark the beginning of a backend definition. &lt;databasetype&gt;
              should be one of <b>asyncmeta</b>, <b>config</b>, <b>dnssrv</b>, <b>ldap</b>, <b>ldif</b>,
              <b>mdb</b>, <b>meta</b>, <b>monitor</b>, <b>null</b>, <b>passwd</b>, <b>perl</b>, <b>relay</b>, <b>sock</b>, <b>sql</b>,
              or <b>wt</b>.  At present, only back-mdb implements any options
              of this type, so this setting is not needed for any other
              backends.
</pre> <h2>
GENERAL DATABASE OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Options in this section only apply to the configuration file
       section for the database in which they are defined.  They are
       supported by every type of backend.  Note that the <b>database </b>and
       at least one <b>suffix </b>option are mandatory for each database.

       <b>database &lt;databasetype&gt;</b>
              Mark the beginning of a new database instance definition.
              &lt;databasetype&gt; should be one of <b>asyncmeta</b>, <b>config</b>, <b>dnssrv</b>,
              <b>ldap</b>, <b>ldif</b>, <b>mdb</b>, <b>meta</b>, <b>monitor</b>, <b>null</b>, <b>passwd</b>, <b>perl</b>, <b>relay</b>,
              <b>sock</b>, <b>sql</b>, or <b>wt</b>, depending on which backend will serve
              the database.

              LDAP operations, even subtree searches, normally access
              only one database.  That can be changed by gluing
              databases together with the <b>subordinate </b>keyword.  Access
              controls and some overlays can also involve multiple
              databases.

       <b>add_content_acl on | off</b>
              Controls whether Add operations will perform ACL checks on
              the content of the entry being added. This check is off by
              default. See the <a href="slapd.access.5.html">slapd.access(5)</a> manual page for more
              details on ACL requirements for Add operations.

       <b>extra_attrs &lt;attrlist&gt;</b>
              Lists what attributes need to be added to search requests.
              Local storage backends return the entire entry to the
              frontend.  The frontend takes care of only returning the
              requested attributes that are allowed by ACLs.  However,
              features like access checking and so may need specific
              attributes that are not automatically returned by remote
              storage backends, like proxy backends and so on.
              <b>&lt;attrlist&gt; </b>is a list of attributes that are needed for
              internal purposes and thus always need to be collected,
              even when not explicitly requested by clients.

       <b>hidden on | off</b>
              Controls whether the database will be used to answer
              queries. A database that is hidden will never be selected
              to answer any queries, and any suffix configured on the
              database will be ignored in checks for conflicts with
              other databases. By default, hidden is off.

       <b>lastmod on | off</b>
              Controls whether <b>slapd </b>will automatically maintain the
              modifiersName, modifyTimestamp, creatorsName, and
              createTimestamp attributes for entries. It also controls
              the entryCSN and entryUUID attributes, which are needed by
              the syncrepl provider. By default, lastmod is on.

       <b>lastbind on | off</b>
              Controls whether <b>slapd </b>will automatically maintain the
              pwdLastSuccess attribute for entries. By default, lastbind
              is off.

       <b>lastbind-precision &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              If lastbind is enabled, specifies how frequently
              pwdLastSuccess will be updated. More than <b>integer </b>seconds
              must have passed since the last successful bind. In a
              replicated environment with frequent bind activity it may
              be useful to set this to a large value. On a backend, if
              set to <b>0 </b>(the default), the value set on the frontend is
              used.

       <b>limits &lt;selector&gt; &lt;limit&gt; [&lt;limit&gt; [...]]</b>
              Specify time and size limits based on the operation's
              initiator or base DN.  The argument <b>&lt;selector&gt; </b>can be any
              of

                     anonymous | users | [&lt;dnspec&gt;=]&lt;pattern&gt; |
                     group[/oc[/at]]=&lt;pattern&gt;

              with

                     &lt;dnspec&gt; ::= dn[.&lt;type&gt;][.&lt;style&gt;]

                     &lt;type&gt;  ::= self | this

                     &lt;style&gt; ::= exact | base | onelevel | subtree |
                     children | regex | anonymous

              DN type <b>self </b>is the default and means the bound user,
              while <b>this </b>means the base DN of the operation.  The term
              <b>anonymous </b>matches all unauthenticated clients.  The term
              <b>users </b>matches all authenticated clients; otherwise an
              <b>exact </b>dn pattern is assumed unless otherwise specified by
              qualifying the (optional) key string <b>dn </b>with <b>exact </b>or <b>base</b>
              (which are synonyms), to require an exact match; with
              <b>onelevel</b>, to require exactly one level of depth match;
              with <b>subtree</b>, to allow any level of depth match, including
              the exact match; with <b>children</b>, to allow any level of
              depth match, not including the exact match; <b>regex</b>
              explicitly requires the (default) match based on POSIX
              (''extended'') regular expression pattern.  Finally,
              <b>anonymous </b>matches unbound operations; the <b>pattern </b>field is
              ignored.  The same behavior is obtained by using the
              <b>anonymous </b>form of the <b>&lt;selector&gt; </b>clause.  The term <b>group</b>,
              with the optional objectClass <b>oc </b>and attributeType <b>at</b>
              fields, followed by <b>pattern</b>, sets the limits for any DN
              listed in the values of the <b>at </b>attribute (default <b>member</b>)
              of the <b>oc </b>group objectClass (default <b>groupOfNames</b>) whose
              DN exactly matches <b>pattern</b>.

              The currently supported limits are <b>size </b>and <b>time</b>.

              The syntax for time limits is
              <b>time[.{soft|hard}]=&lt;integer&gt;</b>, where <i>integer</i> is the number
              of seconds slapd will spend answering a search request.
              If no time limit is explicitly requested by the client,
              the <b>soft </b>limit is used; if the requested time limit
              exceeds the <b>hard </b>limit, the value of the limit is used
              instead.  If the <b>hard </b>limit is set to the keyword <i>soft</i>,
              the soft limit is used in either case; if it is set to the
              keyword <i>unlimited</i>, no hard limit is enforced.  Explicit
              requests for time limits smaller or equal to the <b>hard</b>
              limit are honored.  If no limit specifier is set, the
              value is assigned to the <b>soft </b>limit, and the <b>hard </b>limit is
              set to <i>soft</i>, to preserve the original behavior.

              The syntax for size limits is
              <b>size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=&lt;integer&gt;</b>, where <i>integer</i> is
              the maximum number of entries slapd will return answering
              a search request.  If no size limit is explicitly
              requested by the client, the <b>soft </b>limit is used; if the
              requested size limit exceeds the <b>hard </b>limit, the value of
              the limit is used instead.  If the <b>hard </b>limit is set to
              the keyword <i>soft</i>, the soft limit is used in either case;
              if it is set to the keyword <i>unlimited</i>, no hard limit is
              enforced.  Explicit requests for size limits smaller or
              equal to the <b>hard </b>limit are honored.  The <b>unchecked</b>
              specifier sets a limit on the number of candidates a
              search request is allowed to examine.  The rationale
              behind it is that searches for non-properly indexed
              attributes may result in large sets of candidates, which
              must be examined by <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> to determine whether they
              match the search filter or not.  The <b>unchecked </b>limit
              provides a means to drop such operations before they are
              even started.  If the selected candidates exceed the
              <b>unchecked </b>limit, the search will abort with <i>Unwilling to</i>
              <i>perform</i>.  If it is set to the keyword <i>unlimited</i>, no limit
              is applied (the default).  If it is set to <i>disabled</i>, the
              search is not even performed; this can be used to disallow
              searches for a specific set of users.  If no limit
              specifier is set, the value is assigned to the <b>soft </b>limit,
              and the <b>hard </b>limit is set to <i>soft</i>, to preserve the
              original behavior.

              In case of no match, the global limits are used.  The
              default values are the same as for <b>sizelimit </b>and
              <b>timelimit</b>; no limit is set on <b>unchecked</b>.

              If <b>pagedResults </b>control is requested, the <b>hard </b>size limit
              is used by default, because the request of a specific page
              size is considered an explicit request for a limitation on
              the number of entries to be returned.  However, the size
              limit applies to the total count of entries returned
              within the search, and not to a single page.  Additional
              size limits may be enforced; the syntax is
              <b>size.pr={&lt;integer&gt;|noEstimate|unlimited}</b>, where <i>integer</i> is
              the max page size if no explicit limit is set; the keyword
              <i>noEstimate</i> inhibits the server from returning an estimate
              of the total number of entries that might be returned
              (note: the current implementation does not return any
              estimate).  The keyword <i>unlimited</i> indicates that no limit
              is applied to the pagedResults control page size.  The
              syntax <b>size.prtotal={&lt;integer&gt;|hard|unlimited|disabled}</b>
              allows one to set a limit on the total number of entries
              that the pagedResults control will return.  By default it
              is set to the <b>hard </b>limit which will use the size.hard
              value.  When set, <i>integer</i> is the max number of entries
              that the whole search with pagedResults control can
              return.  Use <i>unlimited</i> to allow unlimited number of
              entries to be returned, e.g. to allow the use of the
              pagedResults control as a means to circumvent size
              limitations on regular searches; the keyword <i>disabled</i>
              disables the control, i.e. no paged results can be
              returned.  Note that the total number of entries returned
              when the pagedResults control is requested cannot exceed
              the <b>hard </b>size limit of regular searches unless extended by
              the <b>prtotal </b>switch.

              The <b>limits </b>statement is typically used to let an unlimited
              number of entries be returned by searches performed with
              the identity used by the consumer for synchronization
              purposes by means of the RFC 4533 LDAP Content
              Synchronization protocol (see <b>syncrepl </b>for details).

              When using subordinate databases, it is necessary for any
              limits that are to be applied across the parent and its
              subordinates to be defined in both the parent and its
              subordinates. Otherwise the settings on the subordinate
              databases are not honored.

       <b>maxderefdepth &lt;depth&gt;</b>
              Specifies the maximum number of aliases to dereference
              when trying to resolve an entry, used to avoid infinite
              alias loops. The default is 15.

       <b>multiprovider on | off</b>
              This option puts a consumer database into Multi-Provider
              mode.  Update operations will be accepted from any user,
              not just the updatedn.  The database must already be
              configured as a syncrepl consumer before this keyword may
              be set. This mode also requires a <b>serverID </b>(see above) to
              be configured.  By default, multiprovider is off.

       <b>monitoring on | off</b>
              This option enables database-specific monitoring in the
              entry related to the current database in the
              "cn=Databases,cn=Monitor" subtree of the monitor database,
              if the monitor database is enabled.  Currently, only the
              MDB database provides database-specific monitoring.  If
              monitoring is supported by the backend it defaults to on,
              otherwise off.

       <b>overlay &lt;overlay-name&gt;</b>
              Add the specified overlay to this database. An overlay is
              a piece of code that intercepts database operations in
              order to extend or change them. Overlays are pushed onto a
              stack over the database, and so they will execute in the
              reverse of the order in which they were configured and the
              database itself will receive control last of all. See the
              <a href="slapd.overlays.5.html">slapd.overlays(5)</a> manual page for an overview of the
              available overlays.  Note that all of the database's
              regular settings should be configured before any overlay
              settings.

       <b>readonly on | off</b>
              This option puts the database into "read-only" mode.  Any
              attempts to modify the database will return an "unwilling
              to perform" error.  By default, readonly is off.

       <b>restrict &lt;oplist&gt;</b>
              Specify a whitespace separated list of operations that are
              restricted.  If defined inside a database specification,
              restrictions apply only to that database, otherwise they
              are global.  Operations can be any of <b>add</b>, <b>bind</b>, <b>compare</b>,
              <b>delete</b>, <b>extended[=&lt;OID&gt;]</b>, <b>modify</b>, <b>rename</b>, <b>search</b>, or the
              special pseudo-operations <b>read </b>and <b>write</b>, which
              respectively summarize read and write operations.  The use
              of <i>restrict write</i> is equivalent to <i>readonly on</i> (see
              above).  The <b>extended </b>keyword allows one to indicate the
              OID of the specific operation to be restricted.

       <b>rootdn &lt;dn&gt;</b>
              Specify the distinguished name that is not subject to
              access control or administrative limit restrictions for
              operations on this database.  This DN may or may not be
              associated with an entry.  An empty root DN (the default)
              specifies no root access is to be granted.  It is
              recommended that the rootdn only be specified when needed
              (such as when initially populating a database).  If the
              rootdn is within a namingContext (suffix) of the database,
              a simple bind password may also be provided using the
              <b>rootpw </b>directive. Many optional features, including
              syncrepl, require the rootdn to be defined for the
              database.

       <b>rootpw &lt;password&gt;</b>
              Specify a password (or hash of the password) for the
              rootdn.  The password can only be set if the rootdn is
              within the namingContext (suffix) of the database.  This
              option accepts all RFC 2307 userPassword formats known to
              the server (see <b>password-hash </b>description) as well as
              cleartext.  <a href="../man8/slappasswd.8.html">slappasswd(8)</a> may be used to generate a hash
              of a password.  Cleartext and <b>{CRYPT} </b>passwords are not
              recommended.  If empty (the default), authentication of
              the root DN is by other means (e.g. SASL).  Use of SASL is
              encouraged.

       <b>suffix &lt;dn suffix&gt;</b>
              Specify the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to
              this backend database.  Multiple suffix lines can be given
              and at least one is required for each database definition.

              If the suffix of one database is "inside" that of another,
              the database with the inner suffix must come first in the
              configuration file.  You may also want to glue such
              databases together with the <b>subordinate </b>keyword.

       <b>subordinate [advertise]</b>
              Specify that the current backend database is a subordinate
              of another backend database. A subordinate  database may
              have only one suffix. This option may be used to glue
              multiple databases into a single namingContext.  If the
              suffix of the current database is within the namingContext
              of a superior database, searches against the superior
              database will be propagated to the subordinate as well.
              All of the databases associated with a single
              namingContext should have identical rootdns.  Behavior of
              other LDAP operations is unaffected by this setting. In
              particular, it is not possible to use moddn to move an
              entry from one subordinate to another subordinate within
              the namingContext.

              If the optional <b>advertise </b>flag is supplied, the naming
              context of this database is advertised in the root DSE.
              The default is to hide this database context, so that only
              the superior context is visible.

              If the slap tools <a href="../man8/slapcat.8.html">slapcat(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapadd.8.html">slapadd(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapmodify.8.html">slapmodify(8)</a>,
              or <a href="../man8/slapindex.8.html">slapindex(8)</a> are used on the superior database, any
              glued subordinates that support these tools are opened as
              well.

              Databases that are glued together should usually be
              configured with the same indices (assuming they support
              indexing), even for attributes that only exist in some of
              these databases. In general, all of the glued databases
              should be configured as similarly as possible, since the
              intent is to provide the appearance of a single directory.

              Note that the <i>subordinate</i> functionality is implemented
              internally by the <i>glue</i> overlay and as such its behavior
              will interact with other overlays in use. By default, the
              glue overlay is automatically configured as the last
              overlay on the superior backend. Its position on the
              backend can be explicitly configured by setting an <b>overlay</b>
              <b>glue </b>directive at the desired position. This explicit
              configuration is necessary e.g.  when using the <i>syncprov</i>
              overlay, which needs to follow <i>glue</i> in order to work over
              all of the glued databases. E.g.
                   database mdb
                   suffix dc=example,dc=com
                   ...
                   overlay glue
                   overlay syncprov

       <b>sync_use_subentry</b>
              Store the syncrepl contextCSN in a subentry instead of the
              context entry of the database. The subentry's RDN will be
              "cn=ldapsync". By default the contextCSN is stored in the
              context entry.

              Content Synchronization protocol. Refer to the "OpenLDAP
              Administrator's Guide" for detailed information on setting
              up a replicated <b>slapd </b>directory service using the <b>syncrepl</b>
              replication engine.

              <b>rid </b>identifies the current <b>syncrepl </b>directive within the
              replication consumer site.  It is a non-negative integer
              not greater than 999 (limited to three decimal digits).

              <b>provider </b>specifies the replication provider site
              containing the provider content as an LDAP URI. If &lt;port&gt;
              is not given, the standard LDAP port number (389 or 636)
              is used.

              The content of the <b>syncrepl </b>consumer is defined using a
              search specification as its result set. The consumer <b>slapd</b>
              will send search requests to the provider <b>slapd </b>according
              to the search specification. The search specification
              includes <b>searchbase</b>, <b>scope</b>, <b>filter</b>, <b>attrs</b>, <b>attrsonly</b>,
              <b>sizelimit</b>, and <b>timelimit </b>parameters as in the normal
              search specification. The <b>exattrs </b>option may also be used
              to specify attributes that should be omitted from incoming
              entries.  The <b>scope </b>defaults to <b>sub</b>, the <b>filter </b>defaults
              to <b>(objectclass=*)</b>, and there is no default <b>searchbase</b>.
              The <b>attrs </b>list defaults to <b>"*,+" </b>to return all user and
              operational attributes, and <b>attrsonly </b>and <b>exattrs </b>are
              unset by default.  The <b>sizelimit </b>and <b>timelimit </b>only accept
              "unlimited" and positive integers, and both default to
              "unlimited".  The <b>sizelimit </b>and <b>timelimit </b>parameters
              define a consumer requested limitation on the number of
              entries that can be returned by the LDAP Content
              Synchronization operation; these should be left unchanged
              from the default otherwise replication may never succeed.
              Note, however, that any provider-side limits for the
              replication identity will be enforced by the provider
              regardless of the limits requested by the LDAP Content
              Synchronization operation, much like for any other search
              operation.

              The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol has two
              operation types.  In the <b>refreshOnly </b>operation, the next
              synchronization search operation is periodically
              rescheduled at an interval time (specified by <b>interval</b>
              parameter; 1 day by default) after each synchronization
              operation finishes.  In the <b>refreshAndPersist </b>operation, a
              synchronization search remains persistent in the provider
              slapd.  Further updates to the provider will generate
              <b>searchResultEntry </b>to the consumer slapd as the search
              responses to the persistent synchronization search. If the
              initial search fails due to an error, the next
              synchronization search operation is periodically
              rescheduled at an interval time (specified by <b>interval</b>
              parameter; 1 day by default)

              If an error occurs during replication, the consumer will
              attempt to reconnect according to the <b>retry </b>parameter
              which is a list of the &lt;retry interval&gt; and &lt;# of retries&gt;
              pairs.  For example, retry="60 10 300 3" lets the consumer
              retry every 60 seconds for the first 10 times and then
              retry every 300 seconds for the next 3 times before stop
              retrying. The `+' in &lt;# of retries&gt; means indefinite
              number of retries until success.  If no <b>retry </b>is
              specified, by default syncrepl retries every hour forever.

              The schema checking can be enforced at the LDAP Sync
              consumer site by turning on the <b>schemachecking </b>parameter.
              The default is <b>off</b>.  Schema checking <b>on </b>means that
              replicated entries must have a structural objectClass,
              must obey to objectClass requirements in terms of
              required/allowed attributes, and that naming attributes
              and distinguished values must be present.  As a
              consequence, schema checking should be <b>off </b>when partial
              replication is used.

              The <b>network-timeout </b>parameter sets how long the consumer
              will wait to establish a network connection to the
              provider. Once a connection is established, the <b>timeout</b>
              parameter determines how long the consumer will wait for
              the initial Bind request to complete. The defaults for
              these parameters come from <a href="ldap.conf.5.html">ldap.conf(5)</a>.  The
              <b>tcp-user-timeout </b>parameter, if non-zero, corresponds to
              the <b>TCP_USER_TIMEOUT </b>set on the target connections,
              overriding the operating system setting.  Only some
              systems support the customization of this parameter, it is
              ignored otherwise and system-wide settings are used.

              A <b>bindmethod </b>of <b>simple </b>requires the options <b>binddn </b>and
              <b>credentials </b>and should only be used when adequate security
              services (e.g. TLS or IPSEC) are in place.  <b>REMEMBER:</b>
              <b>simple bind credentials must be in cleartext!  </b>A
              <b>bindmethod </b>of <b>sasl </b>requires the option <b>saslmech.</b>
              Depending on the mechanism, an authentication identity
              and/or credentials can be specified using <b>authcid </b>and
              <b>credentials.  </b>The <b>authzid </b>parameter may be used to specify
              an authorization identity.  Specific security properties
              (as with the <b>sasl-secprops </b>keyword above) for a SASL bind
              can be set with the <b>secprops </b>option. A non default SASL
              realm can be set with the <b>realm </b>option.  The identity used
              for synchronization by the consumer should be allowed to
              receive an unlimited number of entries in response to a
              search request.  The provider, other than allowing
              authentication of the syncrepl identity, should grant that
              identity appropriate access privileges to the data that is
              being replicated (<b>access </b>directive), and appropriate time
              and size limits.  This can be accomplished by either
              allowing unlimited <b>sizelimit </b>and <b>timelimit</b>, or by setting
              an appropriate <b>limits </b>statement in the consumer's
              configuration (see <b>sizelimit </b>and <b>limits </b>for details).

              The <b>keepalive </b>parameter sets the values of <i>idle</i>, <i>probes</i>,
              and <i>interval</i> used to check whether a socket is alive; <i>idle</i>
              is the number of seconds a connection needs to remain idle
              before TCP starts sending keepalive probes; <i>probes</i> is the
              maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before
              dropping the connection; <i>interval</i> is interval in seconds
              between individual keepalive probes.  Only some systems
              support the customization of these values; the <b>keepalive</b>
              parameter is ignored otherwise, and system-wide settings
              are used.

              The <b>starttls </b>parameter specifies use of the StartTLS
              extended operation to establish a TLS session before
              Binding to the provider. If the <b>critical </b>argument is
              supplied, the session will be aborted if the StartTLS
              request fails. Otherwise the syncrepl session continues
              without TLS. The <b>tls_reqcert </b>setting defaults to "demand",
              the <b>tls_reqsan </b>setting defaults to "allow", and the other
              TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS
              settings.

              The <b>suffixmassage </b>parameter allows the consumer to pull
              entries from a remote directory whose DN suffix differs
              from the local directory. The portion of the remote
              entries' DNs that matches the <i>searchbase</i> will be replaced
              with the suffixmassage DN.

              Rather than replicating whole entries, the consumer can
              query logs of data modifications. This mode of operation
              is referred to as <i>delta syncrepl</i>. In addition to the above
              parameters, the <b>logbase </b>and <b>logfilter </b>parameters must be
              set appropriately for the log that will be used. The
              <b>syncdata </b>parameter must be set to either "accesslog" if
              the log conforms to the <a href="slapo-accesslog.5.html">slapo-accesslog(5)</a> log format, or
              "changelog" if the log conforms to the obsolete <i>changelog</i>
              format. If the <b>syncdata </b>parameter is omitted or set to
              "default" then the log parameters are ignored.

              The <b>lazycommit </b>parameter tells the underlying database
              that it can store changes without performing a full flush
              after each change. This may improve performance for the
              consumer, while sacrificing safety or durability.

       <b>updatedn &lt;dn&gt;</b>
              This option is only applicable in a replica database.  It
              specifies the DN permitted to update (subject to access
              controls) the replica.  It is only needed in certain push-
              mode replication scenarios.  Generally, this DN <i>should not</i>
              be the same as the <b>rootdn </b>used at the provider.

       <b>updateref &lt;url&gt;</b>
              Specify the referral to pass back when <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> is asked
              to modify a replicated local database.  If specified
              multiple times, each url is provided.
