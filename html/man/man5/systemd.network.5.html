NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd.network - Network configuration
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>network</i>.network
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A plain ini-style text file that encodes network configuration
       for matching network interfaces, used by <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.8.html">systemd-networkd(8)</a>. See
       <a href="../man7/systemd.syntax.7.html">systemd.syntax(7)</a> for a general description of the syntax.

       The main network file must have the extension .network; other
       extensions are ignored. Networks are applied to links whenever
       the links appear.

       The .network files are read from the files located in the system
       network directories /usr/lib/systemd/network and
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/network [1], the volatile runtime network
       directory /run/systemd/network and the local administration
       network directory /etc/systemd/network. All configuration files
       are collectively sorted and processed in alphanumeric order,
       regardless of the directories in which they live. However, files
       with identical filenames replace each other. It is recommended
       that each filename is prefixed with a number smaller than "70"
       (e.g.  10-eth0.network). Otherwise, the default .network files or
       those generated by <a href="../man8/systemd-network-generator.service.8.html">systemd-network-generator.service(8)</a> may take
       precedence over user configured files. Files in /etc/ have the
       highest priority, files in /run/ take precedence over files with
       the same name under /usr/. This can be used to override a
       system-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed.
       As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with
       the same name pointing to /dev/null disables the configuration
       file entirely (it is "masked").

       Along with the network file foo.network, a "drop-in" directory
       foo.network.d/ may exist. All files with the suffix ".conf" from
       this directory will be merged in the alphanumeric order and
       parsed after the main file itself has been parsed. This is useful
       to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify
       the main configuration file. Each drop-in file must have
       appropriate section headers.

       In addition to /etc/systemd/network, drop-in ".d" directories can
       be placed in /usr/lib/systemd/network or /run/systemd/network
       directories. Drop-in files in /etc/ take precedence over those in
       /run/ which in turn take precedence over those in /usr/lib/.
       Drop-in files under any of these directories take precedence over
       the main network file wherever located.
</pre> <h2>
[MATCH] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The network file contains a [Match] section, which determines if
       a given network file may be applied to a given interface; and a
       [Network] section specifying how the interface should be
       configured. The first (in alphanumeric order) of the network
       files that matches a given interface is applied, all later files
       are ignored, even if they match as well.

       Note that any network interfaces that have the <i>ID_NET_MANAGED_BY=</i>
       udev property set will never be matched by any .network files –
       unless the property's value is the string "io.systemd.Network" –
       even if the [Match] section would otherwise match. This may be
       used to exclude specific network interfaces from
       <b>systemd-networkd</b>'s management, while keeping the [Match] section
       generic. The <i>ID_NET_MANAGED_BY=</i> property thus declares intended
       <i>ownership</i> of the device, and permits ensuring that concurrent
       network management implementations do not compete for management
       of specific devices.

       A network file is said to match a network interface if all
       matches specified by the [Match] section are satisfied. When a
       network file does not contain valid settings in [Match] section,
       then the file will match all interfaces and <b>systemd-networkd</b>
       warns about that. Hint: to avoid the warning and to make it clear
       that all interfaces shall be matched, add the following:

           Name=*

       The following keys are accepted:

       <i>MACAddress=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of hardware addresses. The
           acceptable formats are:

           <b>colon-delimited hexadecimal</b>
               Each field must be one byte. E.g.  "12:34:56:78:90:ab" or
               "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF".

               Added in version 250.

           <b>hyphen-delimited hexadecimal</b>
               Each field must be one byte. E.g.  "12-34-56-78-90-ab" or
               "AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF".

               Added in version 250.

           <b>dot-delimited hexadecimal</b>
               Each field must be two bytes. E.g.  "1234.5678.90ab" or
               "AABB.CCDD.EEFF".

               Added in version 250.

           <b>IPv4 address format</b>
               E.g.  "127.0.0.1" or "192.168.0.1".

               Added in version 250.

           <b>IPv6 address format</b>
               E.g.  "2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334" or "::1".

               Added in version 250.

           The total length of each MAC address must be 4 (for IPv4
           tunnel), 6 (for Ethernet), 16 (for IPv6 tunnel), or 20 (for
           InfiniBand). This option may appear more than once, in which
           case the lists are merged. If the empty string is assigned to
           this option, the list of hardware addresses defined prior to
           this is reset. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>PermanentMACAddress=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of hardware's permanent
           addresses. While <i>MACAddress=</i> matches the device's current MAC
           address, this matches the device's permanent MAC address,
           which may be different from the current one. Use full colon-,
           hyphen- or dot-delimited hexadecimal, or IPv4 or IPv6 address
           format. This option may appear more than once, in which case
           the lists are merged. If the empty string is assigned to this
           option, the list of hardware addresses defined prior to this
           is reset. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 245.

       <i>Path=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the
           persistent path, as exposed by the udev property <i>ID_PATH</i>.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>Driver=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the
           driver currently bound to the device, as exposed by the udev
           property <i>ID_NET_DRIVER</i> of its parent device, or if that is
           not set, the driver as exposed by <b>ethtool -i </b>of the device
           itself. If the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is
           inverted.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>Type=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the
           device type, as exposed by <b>networkctl list</b>. If the list is
           prefixed with a "!", the test is inverted. Some valid values
           are "ether", "loopback", "wlan", "wwan". Valid types are
           named either from the udev "DEVTYPE" attribute, or "ARPHRD_"
           macros in linux/if_arp.h, so this is not comprehensive.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>Kind=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the
           device kind, as exposed by <b>networkctl status </b><i>INTERFACE</i> or <b>ip</b>
           <b>-d link show </b><i>INTERFACE</i>. If the list is prefixed with a "!",
           the test is inverted. Some valid values are "bond", "bridge",
           "gre", "tun", "veth". Valid kinds are given by netlink's
           "IFLA_INFO_KIND" attribute, so this is not comprehensive.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>Property=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of udev property names with their
           values after equals sign ("="). If multiple properties are
           specified, the test results are ANDed. If the list is
           prefixed with a "!", the test is inverted. If a value
           contains white spaces, then please quote whole key and value
           pair. If a value contains quotation, then please escape the
           quotation with "\".

           Example: if a .link file has the following:

               Property=ID_MODEL_ID=9999 "ID_VENDOR_FROM_DATABASE=vendor name" "KEY=with \"quotation\""

           then, the .link file matches only when an interface has all
           the above three properties.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>Name=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the
           device name, as exposed by the udev property "INTERFACE", or
           device's alternative names. If the list is prefixed with a
           "!", the test is inverted.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>WLANInterfaceType=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of wireless network type.
           Supported values are "ad-hoc", "station", "ap", "ap-vlan",
           "wds", "monitor", "mesh-point", "p2p-client", "p2p-go",
           "p2p-device", "ocb", and "nan". If the list is prefixed with
           a "!", the test is inverted.

           Added in version 244.

       <i>SSID=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the
           SSID of the currently connected wireless LAN. If the list is
           prefixed with a "!", the test is inverted.

           Added in version 244.

       <i>BSSID=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of hardware address of the
           currently connected wireless LAN. Use full colon-, hyphen- or
           dot-delimited hexadecimal. See the example in <i>MACAddress=</i>.
           This option may appear more than once, in which case the
           lists are merged. If the empty string is assigned to this
           option, the list is reset.

           Added in version 244.

       <i>Host=</i>
           Matches against the hostname or machine ID of the host. See
           <i>ConditionHost=</i> in <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for details. When prefixed
           with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an
           empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is
           cleared.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>Virtualization=</i>
           Checks whether the system is executed in a virtualized
           environment and optionally test whether it is a specific
           implementation. See <i>ConditionVirtualization=</i> in
           <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for details. When prefixed with an
           exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty
           string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>KernelCommandLine=</i>
           Checks whether a specific kernel command line option is set.
           See <i>ConditionKernelCommandLine=</i> in <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for
           details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"), the
           result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the
           previously assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>KernelVersion=</i>
           Checks whether the kernel version (as reported by <b>uname -r</b>)
           matches a certain expression. See <i>ConditionKernelVersion=</i> in
           <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for details. When prefixed with an
           exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty
           string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 237.

       <i>Credential=</i>
           Checks whether the specified credential was passed to the
           systemd-udevd.service service. See <b>System and Service</b>
           <b>Credentials</b>[2] for details. When prefixed with an exclamation
           mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty string is
           assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 252.

       <i>Architecture=</i>
           Checks whether the system is running on a specific
           architecture. See <i>ConditionArchitecture=</i> in <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>
           for details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"),
           the result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the
           previously assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>Firmware=</i>
           Checks whether the system is running on a machine with the
           specified firmware. See <i>ConditionFirmware=</i> in <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>
           for details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"),
           the result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the
           previously assigned value is cleared.

</pre> <h2>
[LINK] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [Link] section accepts the following keys:

       <i>MACAddress=</i>
           The hardware address to set for the device.

           Added in version 218.

       <i>MTUBytes=</i>
           The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the device.
           The usual suffixes K, M, G, are supported and are understood
           to the base of 1024.

           Note that if IPv6 is enabled on the interface, and the MTU is
           chosen below 1280 (the minimum MTU for IPv6) it will
           automatically be increased to this value.

           Added in version 218.

       <i>ARP=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, the ARP (low-level Address
           Resolution Protocol) for this interface is enabled. When
           unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           For example, disabling ARP is useful when creating multiple
           MACVLAN or VLAN virtual interfaces atop a single lower-level
           physical interface, which will then only serve as a
           link/"bridge" device aggregating traffic to the same physical
           link and not participate in the network otherwise. Defaults
           to unset.

           Added in version 232.

       <i>Multicast=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, the multicast flag on the
           device is enabled. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 239.

       <i>AllMulticast=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, the driver retrieves all
           multicast packets from the network. This happens when
           multicast routing is enabled. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 239.

       <i>Promiscuous=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, promiscuous mode of the
           interface is enabled. Defaults to unset.

           If this is set to false for the underlying link of a
           "passthru" mode MACVLAN/MACVTAP, the virtual interface will
           be created with the "nopromisc" flag set.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>Unmanaged=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When "yes", no attempts are made to bring up
           or configure matching links, equivalent to when there are no
           matching network files. Defaults to "no".

           This is useful for preventing later matching network files
           from interfering with certain interfaces that are fully
           controlled by other applications.

           Added in version 233.

       <i>Group=</i>
           Link groups are similar to port ranges found in managed
           switches. When network interfaces are added to a numbered
           group, operations on all the interfaces from that group can
           be performed at once. Takes an unsigned integer in the range
           0...2147483647. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>RequiredForOnline=</i>
           Takes a boolean, a minimum operational state (e.g.,
           "carrier"), or a range of operational state separated with a
           colon (e.g., "degraded:routable"). Please see <a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl(1)</a>
           for possible operational states. When "yes", the network is
           deemed required when determining whether the system is online
           (including when running <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b>). When
           "no", the network is ignored when determining the online
           state. When a minimum operational state and an optional
           maximum operational state are set,
           <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>deems that the interface is
           online when the operational state is in the specified range.

           Defaults to "yes" when <i>ActivationPolicy=</i> is not set, or set
           to "up", "always-up", or "bound". Defaults to "no" when
           <i>ActivationPolicy=</i> is set to "manual" or "down". This is
           forced to "no" when <i>ActivationPolicy=</i> is set to
           "always-down".

           The network will be brought up normally (as configured by
           <i>ActivationPolicy=</i>), but in the event that there is no address
           being assigned by DHCP or the cable is not plugged in, the
           link will simply remain offline and be skipped automatically
           by <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>if "RequiredForOnline=no".

           The boolean value "yes" is translated as follows;

           <b>CAN devices</b>
               "carrier",

               Added in version 256.

           <b>Master devices, e.g. bond or bridge</b>
               "degraded-carrier" with <i>RequiredFamilyForOnline=any</i>,

               Added in version 256.

           <b>Bonding port interfaces</b>
               "enslaved",

               Added in version 256.

           <b>Other interfaces</b>
               "degraded".

               Added in version 236.

           This setting can be overridden by the command line option for
           <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b>. See
           <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service.8.html">systemd-networkd-wait-online.service(8)</a> for more details.

           Added in version 236.

       <i>RequiredFamilyForOnline=</i>
           Takes an address family. When specified, an IP address in the
           given family is deemed required when determining whether the
           link is online (including when running
           <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b>). Takes one of "ipv4", "ipv6",
           "both", or "any". Defaults to "no". Note that this option has
           no effect if "RequiredForOnline=no".

           Added in version 249.

       <i>ActivationPolicy=</i>
           Specifies the policy for <b>systemd-networkd </b>managing the link
           administrative state. Specifically, this controls how
           <b>systemd-networkd </b>changes the network device's "IFF_UP" flag,
           which is sometimes controlled by system administrators by
           running e.g., <b>ip link set dev eth0 up </b>or <b>ip link set dev eth0</b>
           <b>down</b>, and can also be changed with <b>networkctl up eth0 </b>or
           <b>networkctl down eth0</b>.

           Takes one of "up", "always-up", "manual", "always-down",
           "down", or "bound". When "manual", <b>systemd-networkd </b>will not
           change the link's admin state automatically; the system
           administrator must bring the interface up or down manually,
           as desired. When "up" (the default) or "always-up", or "down"
           or "always-down", <b>systemd-networkd </b>will set the link up or
           down, respectively, when the interface is (re)configured.
           When "always-up" or "always-down", <b>systemd-networkd </b>will set
           the link up or down, respectively, any time <b>systemd-networkd</b>
           detects a change in the administrative state. When
           <i>BindCarrier=</i> is also set, this is automatically set to
           "bound" and any other value is ignored.

           When the policy is set to "down" or "manual", the default
           value of <i>RequiredForOnline=</i> is "no". When the policy is set
           to "always-down", the value of <i>RequiredForOnline=</i> forced to
           "no".

           The administrative state is not the same as the carrier
           state, so using "always-up" does not mean the link will never
           lose carrier. The link carrier depends on both the
           administrative state as well as the network device's physical
           connection. However, to avoid reconfiguration failures, when
           using "always-up", <i>IgnoreCarrierLoss=</i> is forced to true.

           Added in version 248.
</pre> <h2>
[SR-IOV] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [SR-IOV] section accepts the following keys. Specify several
       [SR-IOV] sections to configure several SR-IOVs. SR-IOV provides
       the ability to partition a single physical PCI resource into
       virtual PCI functions which can then be injected into a VM. In
       the case of network VFs, SR-IOV improves north-south network
       performance (that is, traffic with endpoints outside the host
       machine) by allowing traffic to bypass the host machine’s network
       stack.

       <i>VirtualFunction=</i>
           Specifies a Virtual Function (VF), lightweight PCIe function
           designed solely to move data in and out. Takes an integer in
           the range 0...2147483646. This option is compulsory.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>VLANId=</i>
           Specifies VLAN ID of the virtual function. Takes an integer
           in the range 1...4095.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>QualityOfService=</i>
           Specifies quality of service of the virtual function. Takes
           an integer in the range 1...4294967294.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>VLANProtocol=</i>
           Specifies VLAN protocol of the virtual function. Takes
           "802.1Q" or "802.1ad".

           Added in version 251.

       <i>MACSpoofCheck=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Controls the MAC spoof checking. When unset,
           the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>QueryReceiveSideScaling=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Toggle the ability of querying the receive
           side scaling (RSS) configuration of the virtual function
           (VF). The VF RSS information like RSS hash key may be
           considered sensitive on some devices where this information
           is shared between VF and the physical function (PF). When
           unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>Trust=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Allows one to set trust mode of the virtual
           function (VF). When set, VF users can set a specific feature
           which may impact security and/or performance. When unset, the
           kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>LinkState=</i>
           Allows one to set the link state of the virtual function
           (VF). Takes a boolean or a special value "auto". Setting to
           "auto" means a reflection of the physical function (PF) link
           state, "yes" lets the VF to communicate with other VFs on
           this host even if the PF link state is down, "no" causes the
           hardware to drop any packets sent by the VF. When unset, the
           kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>MACAddress=</i>
           Specifies the MAC address for the virtual function.

           Added in version 251.
</pre> <h2>
[NETWORK] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [Network] section accepts the following keys:

       <i>Description=</i>
           A description of the device. This is only used for
           presentation purposes.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>DHCP=</i>
           Enables DHCPv4 and/or DHCPv6 client support. Accepts "yes",
           "no", "ipv4", or "ipv6". Defaults to "no".

           Note that DHCPv6 will by default be triggered by Router
           Advertisements, if reception is enabled, regardless of this
           parameter. By explicitly enabling DHCPv6 support here, the
           DHCPv6 client will be started in the mode specified by the
           <i>WithoutRA=</i> setting in the [DHCPv6] section, regardless of the
           presence of routers on the link, or what flags the routers
           pass. See <i>IPv6AcceptRA=</i>.

           Furthermore, note that by default the domain name specified
           through DHCP is not used for name resolution. See option
           <b>UseDomains= </b>below.

           See the [DHCPv4] or [DHCPv6] sections below for further
           configuration options for the DHCP client support.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>DHCPServer=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set to "yes", DHCPv4 server will be
           started. Defaults to "no". Further settings for the DHCP
           server may be set in the [DHCPServer] section described
           below.

           Even if this is enabled, the DHCP server will not be started
           automatically and wait for the persistent storage being ready
           to load/save leases in the storage, unless <i>RelayTarget=</i> or
           <i>PersistLeases=no</i> are specified in the [DHCPServer] section.
           It will be started after
           systemd-networkd-persistent-storage.service is started, which
           calls <b>networkctl persistent-storage yes</b>. See <a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl(1)</a>
           for more details.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>LinkLocalAddressing=</i>
           Enables link-local address autoconfiguration. Accepts a
           boolean, <b>ipv4</b>, and <b>ipv6</b>. An IPv6 link-local address is
           configured when <b>yes </b>or <b>ipv6</b>. An IPv4 link-local address is
           configured when <b>yes </b>or <b>ipv4 </b>and when DHCPv4 autoconfiguration
           has been unsuccessful for some time. (IPv4 link-local address
           autoconfiguration will usually happen in parallel with
           repeated attempts to acquire a DHCPv4 lease).

           Defaults to <b>no </b>when <i>KeepMaster=</i> or <i>Bridge=</i> is set or when the
           specified <i>MACVLAN=</i>/<i>MACVTAP=</i> has <i>Mode=passthru</i>, or <b>ipv6</b>
           otherwise.

           Added in version 219.

       <i>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=</i>
           Specifies how IPv6 link-local address is generated. Takes one
           of "eui64", "none", "stable-privacy" and "random". When
           unset, "stable-privacy" is used if <i>IPv6StableSecretAddress=</i>
           is specified, and if not, "eui64" is used. Note that if
           <i>LinkLocalAddressing=</i> is "no" or "ipv4", then
           <i>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=</i> will be ignored. Also,
           even if <i>LinkLocalAddressing=</i> is "yes" or "ipv6", setting
           <i>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=none</i> disables to configure
           an IPv6 link-local address.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>IPv6StableSecretAddress=</i>
           Takes an IPv6 address. The specified address will be used as
           a stable secret for generating IPv6 link-local address. If
           this setting is specified, and
           <i>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=</i> is unset, then
           <i>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=stable-privacy</i> is implied.
           If this setting is not specified, and "stable-privacy" is set
           to <i>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=</i>, then a stable secret
           address will be generated from the local machine ID and the
           interface name.

           Added in version 249.

       <i>IPv4LLStartAddress=</i>
           Specifies the first IPv4 link-local address to try. Takes an
           IPv4 address for example 169.254.1.2, from the link-local
           address range: 169.254.0.0/16 except for 169.254.0.0/24 and
           169.254.255.0/24. This setting may be useful if the device
           should always have the same address as long as there is no
           address conflict. When unset, a random address will be
           automatically selected. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 252.

       <i>IPv4LLRoute=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, sets up the route needed for
           non-IPv4LL hosts to communicate with IPv4LL-only hosts.
           Defaults to false.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>DefaultRouteOnDevice=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, sets up the IPv4 default
           route bound to the interface. Defaults to false. This is
           useful when creating routes on point-to-point interfaces.
           This is equivalent to e.g. the following,

               ip route add default dev veth99

           or,

               [Route]
               Gateway=0.0.0.0

           Currently, there are no way to specify e.g., the table for
           the route configured by this setting. To configure the
           default route with such an additional property, please use
           the following instead:

               [Route]
               Gateway=0.0.0.0
               Table=1234

           If you'd like to create an IPv6 default route bound to the
           interface, please use the following:

               [Route]
               Gateway=::
               Table=1234

           Added in version 243.

       <i>LLMNR=</i>
           Takes a boolean or "resolve". When true, enables <b>Link-Local</b>
           <b>Multicast Name Resolution</b>[3] on the link. When set to
           "resolve", only resolution is enabled, but not host
           registration and announcement. Defaults to true. This setting
           is read by <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a>.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>MulticastDNS=</i>
           Takes a boolean or "resolve". When true, enables <b>Multicast</b>
           <b>DNS</b>[4] support on the link. When set to "resolve", only
           resolution is enabled, but not host or service registration
           and announcement. Defaults to false. This setting is read by
           <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a>.

           Added in version 229.

       <i>DNSOverTLS=</i>
           Takes a boolean or "opportunistic". When true, enables
           <b>DNS-over-TLS</b>[5] support on the link. When set to
           "opportunistic", compatibility with non-DNS-over-TLS servers
           is increased, by automatically turning off DNS-over-TLS
           servers in this case. This option defines a per-interface
           setting for <a href="resolved.conf.5.html">resolved.conf(5)</a>'s global <i>DNSOverTLS=</i> option.
           Defaults to unset, and the global setting will be used. This
           setting is read by <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a>.

           Added in version 239.

       <i>DNSSEC=</i>
           Takes a boolean or "allow-downgrade". When true, enables
           <b>DNSSEC</b>[6] DNS validation support on the link. When set to
           "allow-downgrade", compatibility with non-DNSSEC capable
           networks is increased, by automatically turning off DNSSEC in
           this case. This option defines a per-interface setting for
           <a href="resolved.conf.5.html">resolved.conf(5)</a>'s global <i>DNSSEC=</i> option. Defaults to unset,
           and the global setting will be used. This setting is read by
           <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a>.

           Added in version 229.

       <i>DNSSECNegativeTrustAnchors=</i>
           A space-separated list of DNSSEC negative trust anchor
           domains. If specified and DNSSEC is enabled, look-ups done
           via the interface's DNS server will be subject to the list of
           negative trust anchors, and not require authentication for
           the specified domains, or anything below it. Use this to
           disable DNSSEC authentication for specific private domains,
           that cannot be proven valid using the Internet DNS hierarchy.
           Defaults to the empty list. This setting is read by
           <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a>.

           Added in version 229.

       <i>LLDP=</i>
           Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet reception. LLDP is
           a link-layer protocol commonly implemented on professional
           routers and bridges which announces which physical port a
           system is connected to, as well as other related data.
           Accepts a boolean or the special value "routers-only". When
           true, incoming LLDP packets are accepted and a database of
           all LLDP neighbors maintained. If "routers-only" is set only
           LLDP data of various types of routers is collected and LLDP
           data about other types of devices ignored (such as stations,
           telephones and others). If false, LLDP reception is disabled.
           Defaults to "routers-only". Use <a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl(1)</a> to query the
           collected neighbor data. LLDP is only available on Ethernet
           links. See <i>EmitLLDP=</i> below for enabling LLDP packet emission
           from the local system.

           Added in version 219.

       <i>EmitLLDP=</i>
           Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet emission. Accepts a
           boolean parameter or the special values "nearest-bridge",
           "non-tpmr-bridge" and "customer-bridge". Defaults to false,
           which turns off LLDP packet emission. If not false, a short
           LLDP packet with information about the local system is sent
           out in regular intervals on the link. The LLDP packet will
           contain information about the local hostname, the local
           machine ID (as stored in <a href="machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a>) and the local
           interface name, as well as the pretty hostname of the system
           (as set in <a href="machine-info.5.html">machine-info(5)</a>). LLDP emission is only available
           on Ethernet links. Note that this setting passes data
           suitable for identification of host to the network and should
           thus not be enabled on untrusted networks, where such
           identification data should not be made available. Use this
           option to permit other systems to identify on which
           interfaces they are connected to this system. The three
           special values control propagation of the LLDP packets. The
           "nearest-bridge" setting permits propagation only to the
           nearest connected bridge, "non-tpmr-bridge" permits
           propagation across Two-Port MAC Relays, but not any other
           bridges, and "customer-bridge" permits propagation until a
           customer bridge is reached. For details about these concepts,
           see <b>IEEE 802.1AB-2016</b>[7]. Note that configuring this setting
           to true is equivalent to "nearest-bridge", the recommended
           and most restricted level of propagation. See <i>LLDP=</i> above for
           an option to enable LLDP reception.

           Added in version 230.

       <i>BindCarrier=</i>
           A link name or a list of link names. When set, controls the
           behavior of the current link. When all links in the list are
           in an operational down state, the current link is brought
           down. When at least one link has carrier, the current
           interface is brought up.

           This forces <i>ActivationPolicy=</i> to be set to "bound".

           Added in version 220.

       <i>Address=</i>
           A static IPv4 or IPv6 address and its prefix length,
           separated by a "/" character. Specify this key more than once
           to configure several addresses. The format of the address
           must be as described in <a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton(3)</a>. This is a short-hand
           for an [Address] section only containing an Address key (see
           below). This option may be specified more than once.

           If the specified address is "0.0.0.0" (for IPv4) or "::" (for
           IPv6), a new address range of the requested size is
           automatically allocated from a system-wide pool of unused
           ranges. Note that the prefix length must be equal or larger
           than 8 for IPv4, and 64 for IPv6. The allocated range is
           checked against all current network interfaces and all known
           network configuration files to avoid address range conflicts.
           The default system-wide pool consists of 192.168.0.0/16,
           172.16.0.0/12 and 10.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, and fd00::/8 for IPv6.
           This functionality is useful to manage a large number of
           dynamically created network interfaces with the same network
           configuration and automatic address range assignment.

           If an empty string is specified, then the all previous
           assignments in both [Network] and [Address] sections are
           cleared.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>Gateway=</i>
           The gateway address, which must be in the format described in
           <a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton(3)</a>. This is a short-hand for a [Route] section only
           containing a <i>Gateway=</i> key. This option may be specified more
           than once.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>DNS=</i>
           A DNS server address, which must be in the format described
           in <a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton(3)</a>. This option may be specified more than once.
           Each address can optionally take a port number separated with
           ":", a network interface name or index separated with "%",
           and a Server Name Indication (SNI) separated with "#". When
           IPv6 address is specified with a port number, then the
           address must be in the square brackets. That is, the
           acceptable full formats are
           "111.222.333.444:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv4 and
           "[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv6. If an
           empty string is assigned, then the all previous assignments
           are cleared. This setting is read by
           <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a>.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>UseDomains=</i>
           Specifies the protocol-independent default value for the same
           settings in [IPv6AcceptRA], [DHCPv4], and [DHCPv6] sections
           below. Takes a boolean, or the special value <b>route</b>. See also
           the same setting in [DHCPv4] below. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 256.

       <i>Domains=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of domains which should be
           resolved using the DNS servers on this link. Each item in the
           list should be a domain name, optionally prefixed with a
           tilde ("~"). The domains with the prefix are called
           "routing-only domains". The domains without the prefix are
           called "search domains" and are first used as search suffixes
           for extending single-label hostnames (hostnames containing no
           dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). If a
           single-label hostname is resolved on this interface, each of
           the specified search domains are appended to it in turn,
           converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one
           of them may be successfully resolved.

           Both "search" and "routing-only" domains are used for routing
           of DNS queries: look-ups for hostnames ending in those
           domains (hence also single label names, if any "search
           domains" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers
           configured for this interface. The domain routing logic is
           particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers
           serving particular private DNS zones on each interface.

           The "routing-only" domain "~."  (the tilde indicating
           definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS
           root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS
           names) has special effect. It causes all DNS traffic which
           does not match another configured domain routing entry to be
           routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This
           setting is useful to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a
           link on which they are connected is available.

           This setting is read by <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a>. "Search
           domains" correspond to the <i>domain</i> and <i>search</i> entries in
           <a href="resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf(5)</a>. Domain name routing has no equivalent in the
           traditional glibc API, which has no concept of domain name
           servers limited to a specific link.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>DNSDefaultRoute=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, this link's configured DNS
           servers are used for resolving domain names that do not match
           any link's configured <i>Domains=</i> setting. If false, this link's
           configured DNS servers are never used for such domains, and
           are exclusively used for resolving names that match at least
           one of the domains configured on this link. If not specified
           defaults to an automatic mode: queries not matching any
           link's configured domains will be routed to this link if it
           has no routing-only domains configured.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>NTP=</i>
           An NTP server address (either an IP address, or a hostname).
           This option may be specified more than once. This setting is
           read by <a href="../man8/systemd-timesyncd.service.8.html">systemd-timesyncd.service(8)</a>.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>IPv4Forwarding=</i>
           Configures IPv4 packet forwarding for the interface. Takes a
           boolean value. This controls the
           net.ipv4.conf.<i>INTERFACE</i>.forwarding sysctl option of the
           network interface. See <b>IP Sysctl</b>[8] for more details about
           the sysctl option. Defaults to true if <i>IPMasquerade=</i> is
           enabled for IPv4, otherwise the value specified to the same
           setting in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a> will be used. If none of them are
           specified, the sysctl option will not be changed.

           To control the global setting, use the same setting in
           <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>.

           Added in version 256.

       <i>IPv6Forwarding=</i>
           Configures IPv6 packet forwarding for the interface. Takes a
           boolean value. This controls the
           net.ipv6.conf.<i>INTERFACE</i>.forwarding sysctl option of the
           network interface. See <b>IP Sysctl</b>[8] for more details about
           the sysctl option. Defaults to true if <i>IPMasquerade=</i> is
           enabled for IPv6 or <i>IPv6SendRA=</i> is enabled, otherwise the
           value specified to the same setting in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a> will
           be used. If none of them are specified, the sysctl option
           will not be changed.

           To control the global setting, use the same setting in
           <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>.

           Added in version 256.

       <i>IPMasquerade=</i>
           Configures IP masquerading for the network interface. If
           enabled, packets forwarded from the network interface will be
           appear as coming from the local host. Typically, this should
           be enabled on the downstream interface of routers. Takes one
           of "ipv4", "ipv6", "both", or "no". Defaults to "no". Note.
           Any positive boolean values such as "yes" or "true" are now
           deprecated. Please use one of the values above. Specifying
           "ipv4" or "both" implies <i>IPv4Forwarding=</i>, unless it is
           explicitly specified. Similarly for <i>IPv6Forwarding=</i> when
           "ipv6" or "both" is specified. These implications are only on
           this interface. Hence, to make the IP packet forwarding
           works, <i>IPv4Forwarding=</i>/<i>IPv6Forwarding=</i> need to be enabled on
           an upstream interface, or globally enabled by specifying them
           in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>. See <i>IPv4Forwarding=</i>/<i>IPv6Forwarding=</i> in
           the above for more details.

           Added in version 219.

       <i>IPv6PrivacyExtensions=</i>
           Configures use of stateless temporary addresses that change
           over time (see <b>RFC 4941</b>[9], Privacy Extensions for Stateless
           Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6). Takes a boolean or the
           special values "prefer-public" and "kernel". When true,
           enables the privacy extensions and prefers temporary
           addresses over public addresses. When "prefer-public",
           enables the privacy extensions, but prefers public addresses
           over temporary addresses. When false, the privacy extensions
           remain disabled. When "kernel", the kernel's default setting
           will be left in place. When unspecified, the value specified
           in the same setting in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>, which defaults to
           "no", will be used.

           Added in version 222.

       <i>IPv6AcceptRA=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Controls IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)
           reception support for the interface. If true, RAs are
           accepted; if false, RAs are ignored. When RAs are accepted,
           they may trigger the start of the DHCPv6 client if the
           relevant flags are set in the RA data, or if no routers are
           found on the link. Defaults to false for bridge devices, when
           IP forwarding is enabled, <i>IPv6SendRA=</i> or <i>KeepMaster=</i> is
           enabled. Otherwise, enabled by default. Cannot be enabled on
           devices aggregated in a bond device or when link-local
           addressing is disabled.

           Further settings for the IPv6 RA support may be configured in
           the [IPv6AcceptRA] section, see below.

           Also see <b>IP Sysctl</b>[8] in the kernel documentation regarding
           "accept_ra", but note that systemd's setting of <b>1 </b>(i.e. true)
           corresponds to kernel's setting of <b>2</b>.

           Note that kernel's implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is
           always disabled, regardless of this setting. If this option
           is enabled, a userspace implementation of the IPv6 RA
           protocol is used, and the kernel's own implementation remains
           disabled, since <b>systemd-networkd </b>needs to know all details
           supplied in the advertisements, and these are not available
           from the kernel if the kernel's own implementation is used.

           Added in version 231.

       <i>IPv6DuplicateAddressDetection=</i>
           Configures the amount of IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection
           (DAD) probes to send. When unset, the kernel's default will
           be used.

           Added in version 228.

       <i>IPv6HopLimit=</i>
           Configures IPv6 Hop Limit. Takes an integer in the range
           1...255. For each router that forwards the packet, the hop
           limit is decremented by 1. When the hop limit field reaches
           zero, the packet is discarded. When unset, the kernel's
           default will be used.

           Added in version 228.

       <i>IPv6RetransmissionTimeSec=</i>
           Configures IPv6 Retransmission Time. The time between
           retransmitted Neighbor Solicitation messages. Used by address
           resolution and the Neighbor Unreachability Detection
           algorithm. A value of zero is ignored and the kernel's
           current value will be used. Defaults to unset, and the
           kernel's current value will be used.

           Added in version 256.

       <i>IPv4ReversePathFilter=</i>
           Configure IPv4 Reverse Path Filtering. If enabled, when an
           IPv4 packet is received, the machine will first check whether
           the <i>source</i> of the packet would be routed through the
           interface it came in. If there is no route to the source on
           that interface, the machine will drop the packet. Takes one
           of "no", "strict", or "loose". When "no", no source
           validation will be done. When "strict", mode each incoming
           packet is tested against the FIB and if the incoming
           interface is not the best reverse path, the packet check will
           fail. By default failed packets are discarded. When "loose",
           mode each incoming packet's source address is tested against
           the FIB. The packet is dropped only if the source address is
           not reachable via any interface on that router. See <b>RFC</b>
           <b>3704</b>[10]. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>IPv4AcceptLocal=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Accept packets with local source addresses.
           In combination with suitable routing, this can be used to
           direct packets between two local interfaces over the wire and
           have them accepted properly. When unset, the kernel's default
           will be used.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>IPv4RouteLocalnet=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the kernel does not consider
           loopback addresses as martian source or destination while
           routing. This enables the use of 127.0.0.0/8 for local
           routing purposes. When unset, the kernel's default will be
           used.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>IPv4ProxyARP=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures proxy ARP for IPv4. Proxy ARP is
           the technique in which one host, usually a router, answers
           ARP requests intended for another machine. By "faking" its
           identity, the router accepts responsibility for routing
           packets to the "real" destination. See <b>RFC 1027</b>[10]. When
           unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 233.

       <i>IPv4ProxyARPPrivateVLAN=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures proxy ARP private VLAN for IPv4,
           also known as VLAN aggregation, private VLAN, source-port
           filtering, port-isolation, or MAC-forced forwarding.

           This variant of the ARP proxy technique will allow the ARP
           proxy to reply back to the same interface.

           See <b>RFC 3069</b>[11]. When unset, the kernel's default will be
           used.

           Added in version 256.

       <i>IPv6ProxyNDP=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures proxy NDP for IPv6. Proxy NDP
           (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) is a technique for IPv6 to
           allow routing of addresses to a different destination when
           peers expect them to be present on a certain physical link.
           In this case a router answers Neighbour Advertisement
           messages intended for another machine by offering its own MAC
           address as destination. Unlike proxy ARP for IPv4, it is not
           enabled globally, but will only send Neighbour Advertisement
           messages for addresses in the IPv6 neighbor proxy table,
           which can also be shown by <b>ip -6 neighbour show proxy</b>.
           systemd-networkd will control the per-interface `proxy_ndp`
           switch for each configured interface depending on this
           option. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 234.

       <i>IPv6ProxyNDPAddress=</i>
           An IPv6 address, for which Neighbour Advertisement messages
           will be proxied. This option may be specified more than once.
           systemd-networkd will add the <i>IPv6ProxyNDPAddress=</i> entries to
           the kernel's IPv6 neighbor proxy table. This setting implies
           <i>IPv6ProxyNDP=yes</i> but has no effect if <i>IPv6ProxyNDP=</i> has been
           set to false. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 233.

       <i>IPv6SendRA=</i>
           Whether to enable or disable Router Advertisement sending on
           a link. Takes a boolean value. When enabled, prefixes
           configured in [IPv6Prefix] sections and routes configured in
           the [IPv6RoutePrefix] sections are distributed as defined in
           the [IPv6SendRA] section. If <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</i> is
           enabled, then the delegated prefixes are also distributed.
           See <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</i> setting and the [IPv6SendRA],
           [IPv6Prefix], [IPv6RoutePrefix], and [DHCPPrefixDelegation]
           sections for more configuration options.

           If enabled, <i>IPv6Forwarding=</i> on this interface is also
           enabled, unless the setting is explicitly specified. See
           <i>IPv6Forwarding=</i> in the above for more details.

           Added in version 247.

       <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</i>
           Takes a boolean value. When enabled, requests subnet prefixes
           on another link via the DHCPv6 protocol or via the 6RD option
           in the DHCPv4 protocol. An address within each delegated
           prefix will be assigned, and the prefixes will be announced
           through IPv6 Router Advertisement if <i>IPv6SendRA=</i> is enabled.
           This behaviour can be configured in the
           [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section. Defaults to disabled.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>IPv6MTUBytes=</i>
           Configures IPv6 maximum transmission unit (MTU). An integer
           greater than or equal to 1280 bytes. When unset, the kernel's
           default will be used.

           Added in version 239.

       <i>KeepMaster=</i>
           Takes a boolean value. When enabled, the current master
           interface index will not be changed, and <i>BatmanAdvanced=</i>,
           <i>Bond=</i>, <i>Bridge=</i>, and <i>VRF=</i> settings are ignored. This may be
           useful when a netdev with a master interface is created by
           another program, e.g.  <a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a>. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>BatmanAdvanced=</i>, <i>Bond=</i>, <i>Bridge=</i>, <i>VRF=</i>
           The name of the B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced, bond, bridge, or VRF
           interface to add the link to. See <a href="systemd.netdev.5.html">systemd.netdev(5)</a>.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>IPoIB=</i>, <i>IPVLAN=</i>, <i>IPVTAP=</i>, <i>MACsec=</i>, <i>MACVLAN=</i>, <i>MACVTAP=</i>, <i>Tunnel=</i>,
       <i>VLAN=</i>, <i>VXLAN=</i>, <i>Xfrm=</i>
           The name of an IPoIB, IPVLAN, IPVTAP, MACsec, MACVLAN,
           MACVTAP, tunnel, VLAN, VXLAN, or Xfrm to be created on the
           link. See <a href="systemd.netdev.5.html">systemd.netdev(5)</a>. This option may be specified
           more than once.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>ActiveSlave=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Specifies the new active slave. The
           "ActiveSlave=" option is only valid for following modes:
           "active-backup", "balance-alb", and "balance-tlb". Defaults
           to false.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>PrimarySlave=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Specifies which slave is the primary device.
           The specified device will always be the active slave while it
           is available. Only when the primary is off-line will
           alternate devices be used. This is useful when one slave is
           preferred over another, e.g. when one slave has higher
           throughput than another. The "PrimarySlave=" option is only
           valid for following modes: "active-backup", "balance-alb",
           and "balance-tlb". Defaults to false.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>ConfigureWithoutCarrier=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Allows networkd to configure a specific link
           even if it has no carrier. Defaults to false. If enabled, and
           the <i>IgnoreCarrierLoss=</i> setting is not explicitly set, then it
           is enabled as well.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>IgnoreCarrierLoss=</i>
           Takes a boolean or a timespan. When true, <b>systemd-networkd</b>
           retains both the static and dynamic configuration of the
           interface even if its carrier is lost. When false,
           <b>systemd-networkd </b>drops both the static and dynamic
           configuration of the interface. When a timespan is specified,
           <b>systemd-networkd </b>waits for the specified timespan, and
           ignores the carrier loss if the link regain its carrier
           within the timespan. Setting 0 seconds is equivalent to "no",
           and "infinite" is equivalent to "yes".

           Setting a finite timespan may be useful when e.g. in the
           following cases:

           •   A wireless interface connecting to a network which has
               multiple access points with the same SSID.

           •   Enslaving a wireless interface to a bond interface, which
               may disconnect from the connected access point and causes
               its carrier to be lost.

           •   The driver of the interface resets when the MTU is
               changed.

           When <i>Bond=</i> is specified to a wireless interface, defaults to
           3 seconds. When the DHCPv4 client is enabled and <i>UseMTU=</i> in
           the [DHCPv4] section enabled, defaults to 5 seconds.
           Otherwise, defaults to the value specified with
           <i>ConfigureWithoutCarrier=</i>. When <i>ActivationPolicy=</i> is set to
           "always-up", this is forced to "yes", and ignored any user
           specified values.

           Added in version 242.

       <i>KeepConfiguration=</i>
           Takes a boolean or one of "static", "dhcp-on-stop", "dhcp".
           When "static", <b>systemd-networkd </b>will not drop static
           addresses and routes on starting up process. When set to
           "dhcp-on-stop", <b>systemd-networkd </b>will not drop addresses and
           routes on stopping the daemon. When "dhcp", the addresses and
           routes provided by a DHCP server will never be dropped even
           if the DHCP lease expires. This is contrary to the DHCP
           specification, but may be the best choice if, e.g., the root
           filesystem relies on this connection. The setting "dhcp"
           implies "dhcp-on-stop", and "yes" implies "dhcp" and
           "static". Defaults to "dhcp-on-stop" when <b>systemd-networkd </b>is
           running in initrd, "yes" when the root filesystem is a
           network filesystem, and "no" otherwise.

           Added in version 243.
</pre> <h2>
[ADDRESS] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       An [Address] section accepts the following keys. Specify several
       [Address] sections to configure several addresses.

       <i>Address=</i>
           As in the [Network] section. This setting is mandatory. Each
           [Address] section can contain one <i>Address=</i> setting.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>Peer=</i>
           The peer address in a point-to-point connection. Accepts the
           same format as the <i>Address=</i> setting.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>Broadcast=</i>
           Takes an IPv4 address or boolean value. The address must be
           in the format described in <a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton(3)</a>. If set to true, then
           the IPv4 broadcast address will be derived from the <i>Address=</i>
           setting. If set to false, then the broadcast address will not
           be set. Defaults to true, except for wireguard interfaces,
           where it default to false.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>Label=</i>
           Specifies the label for the IPv4 address. The label must be a
           7-bit ASCII string with a length of 1...15 characters.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>PreferredLifetime=</i>
           Allows the default "preferred lifetime" of the address to be
           overridden. Only three settings are accepted: "forever",
           "infinity", which is the default and means that the address
           never expires, and "0", which means that the address is
           considered immediately "expired" and will not be used, unless
           explicitly requested. A setting of <b>PreferredLifetime=0 </b>is
           useful for addresses which are added to be used only by a
           specific application, which is then configured to use them
           explicitly.

           Added in version 230.

       <i>Scope=</i>
           The scope of the address, which can be "global" (valid
           everywhere on the network, even through a gateway), "link"
           (only valid on this device, will not traverse a gateway) or
           "host" (only valid within the device itself, e.g. 127.0.0.1)
           or an integer in the range 0...255. Defaults to "global".
           IPv4 only - IPv6 scope is automatically assigned by the
           kernel and cannot be set manually.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>RouteMetric=</i>
           The metric of the prefix route, which is pointing to the
           subnet of the configured IP address, taking the configured
           prefix length into account. Takes an unsigned integer in the
           range 0...4294967295. When unset or set to 0, the kernel's
           default value is used. This setting will be ignored when
           <i>AddPrefixRoute=</i> is false.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>HomeAddress=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Designates this address the "home address"
           as defined in <b>RFC 6275</b>[12]. Supported only on IPv6. Defaults
           to false.

           Added in version 232.

       <i>DuplicateAddressDetection=</i>
           Takes one of "ipv4", "ipv6", "both", or "none". When "ipv4",
           performs IPv4 Address Conflict Detection. See <b>RFC 5227</b>[13].
           When "ipv6", performs IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection. See
           <b>RFC 4862</b>[14]. Defaults to "ipv4" for IPv4 link-local
           addresses, "ipv6" for IPv6 addresses, and "none" otherwise.

           Added in version 232.

       <i>ManageTemporaryAddress=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If true the kernel manage temporary
           addresses created from this one as template on behalf of
           Privacy Extensions <b>RFC 3041</b>[15]. For this to become active,
           the use_tempaddr sysctl setting has to be set to a value
           greater than zero. The given address needs to have a prefix
           length of 64. This flag allows using privacy extensions in a
           manually configured network, just like if stateless
           auto-configuration was active. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 232.

       <i>AddPrefixRoute=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the prefix route for the address
           is automatically added. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 245.

       <i>AutoJoin=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Joining multicast group on ethernet level
           via <b>ip maddr </b>command would not work if we have an Ethernet
           switch that does IGMP snooping since the switch would not
           replicate multicast packets on ports that did not have IGMP
           reports for the multicast addresses. Linux vxlan interfaces
           created via <b>ip link add vxlan </b>or networkd's netdev kind vxlan
           have the group option that enables them to do the required
           join. By extending <b>ip address </b>command with option "autojoin"
           we can get similar functionality for openvswitch (OVS) vxlan
           interfaces as well as other tunneling mechanisms that need to
           receive multicast traffic. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 232.

       <i>NetLabel=label</i>
           This setting provides a method for integrating static and
           dynamic network configuration into Linux <b>NetLabel</b>[16]
           subsystem rules, used by <b>Linux Security Modules (LSMs)</b>[17]
           for network access control. The label, with suitable LSM
           rules, can be used to control connectivity of (for example) a
           service with peers in the local network. At least with
           SELinux, only the ingress can be controlled but not egress.
           The benefit of using this setting is that it may be possible
           to apply interface independent part of NetLabel configuration
           at very early stage of system boot sequence, at the time when
           the network interfaces are not available yet, with
           <b>netlabelctl</b>(8), and the per-interface configuration with
           <b>systemd-networkd </b>once the interfaces appear later. Currently
           this feature is only implemented for SELinux.

           The option expects a single NetLabel label. The label must
           conform to lexical restrictions of LSM labels. When an
           interface is configured with IP addresses, the addresses and
           subnetwork masks will be appended to the <b>NetLabel Fallback</b>
           <b>Peer Labeling</b>[18] rules. They will be removed when the
           interface is deconfigured. Failures to manage the labels will
           be ignored.

               <b>Warning</b>
               Once labeling is enabled for network traffic, a lot of
               LSM access control points in Linux networking stack go
               from dormant to active. Care should be taken to avoid
               getting into a situation where for example remote
               connectivity is broken, when the security policy hasn't
               been updated to consider LSM per-packet access controls
               and no rules would allow any network traffic. Also note
               that additional configuration with <b>netlabelctl</b>(8) is
               needed.
           Example:

               [Address]
               NetLabel=system_u:object_r:localnet_peer_t:s0

           With the example rules applying for interface "eth0", when
           the interface is configured with an IPv4 address of
           10.0.0.123/8, <b>systemd-networkd </b>performs the equivalent of
           <b>netlabelctl </b>operation

               netlabelctl unlbl add interface eth0 address:10.0.0.0/8 label:system_u:object_r:localnet_peer_t:s0

           and the reverse operation when the IPv4 address is
           deconfigured. The configuration can be used with LSM rules;
           in case of SELinux to allow a SELinux domain to receive data
           from objects of SELinux "peer" class. For example:

               type localnet_peer_t;
               allow my_server_t localnet_peer_t:peer recv;

           The effect of the above configuration and rules (in absence
           of other rules as may be the case) is to only allow
           "my_server_t" (and nothing else) to receive data from local
           subnet 10.0.0.0/8 of interface "eth0".

           Added in version 252.

       <i>NFTSet=source</i>:<i>family</i>:<i>table</i>:<i>set</i>
           This setting provides a method for integrating network
           configuration into firewall rules with <b>NFT</b>[19] sets. The
           benefit of using the setting is that static network
           configuration (or dynamically obtained network addresses, see
           similar directives in other sections) can be used in firewall
           rules with the indirection of NFT set types. For example,
           access could be granted for hosts in the local subnetwork
           only. Firewall rules using IP address of an interface are
           also instantly updated when the network configuration
           changes, for example via DHCP.

           This option expects a whitespace separated list of NFT set
           definitions. Each definition consists of a colon-separated
           tuple of source type (one of "address", "prefix" or
           "ifindex"), NFT address family (one of "arp", "bridge",
           "inet", "ip", "ip6", or "netdev"), table name and set name.
           The names of tables and sets must conform to lexical
           restrictions of NFT table names. The type of the element used
           in the NFT filter must match the type implied by the
           directive ("address", "prefix" or "ifindex") and address type
           (IPv4 or IPv6) as shown in the table below.

           <b>Table 1. Defined </b><i>source type</i> values
           ┌─────────────┬─────────────────┬───────────────────┐

           │             │                 │ <b>type name         </b>│
           ├─────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────────────┤

           │ "ifindex"   │ interface index │ "iface_index"     │
           └─────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────────┘

           When an interface is configured with IP addresses, the
           addresses, subnetwork masks or interface index will be
           appended to the NFT sets. The information will be removed
           when the interface is deconfigured.  <b>systemd-networkd </b>only
           inserts elements to (or removes from) the sets, so the
           related NFT rules, tables and sets must be prepared elsewhere
           in advance. Failures to manage the sets will be ignored.

           Example:

               [Address]
               NFTSet=prefix:netdev:filter:eth_ipv4_prefix

           Corresponding NFT rules:

               table netdev filter {
                       set eth_ipv4_prefix {
                               type ipv4_addr
                               flags interval
                       }
                       chain eth_ingress {
                               type filter hook ingress device "eth0" priority filter; policy drop;

[NEIGHBOR] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A [Neighbor] section accepts the following keys. The neighbor
       section adds a permanent, static entry to the neighbor table
       (IPv6) or ARP table (IPv4) for the given hardware address on the
       links matched for the network. Specify several [Neighbor]
       sections to configure several static neighbors.

           field can be used to specify precedence (the first 3 bits)
           and ToS (the next 3 bits). The field can be also used to
           specify Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) (the first
           6 bits) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) (the last
           2 bits). See <b>Type of Service</b>[21] and <b>Differentiated</b>
           <b>services</b>[22] for more details.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>From=</i>
           Specifies the source address prefix to match. Possibly
           followed by a slash and the prefix length.

           Added in version 235.

           Specifies the destination address prefix to match. Possibly
           followed by a slash and the prefix length.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>FirewallMark=</i>
           Specifies the iptables firewall mark value to match (a number
           in the range 1...4294967295). Optionally, the firewall mask
           (also a number between 1...4294967295) can be suffixed with a
           slash ("/"), e.g., "7/255".

           Added in version 235.

       <i>Table=</i>
           Specifies the routing table identifier to look up if the rule
           selector matches. Takes one of predefined names "default",
           "main", and "local", and names defined in <i>RouteTable=</i> in
           <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>, or a number between 1 and 4294967295.
           Defaults to "main".

           Added in version 235.

       <i>Priority=</i>
           Specifies the priority of this rule.  <i>Priority=</i> is an integer
           in the range 0...4294967295. Higher number means lower
           priority, and rules get processed in order of increasing
           number. Defaults to unset, and the kernel will pick a value
           dynamically.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>IncomingInterface=</i>
           Specifies incoming device to match. If the interface is
           loopback, the rule only matches packets originating from this
           host.

           Added in version 236.

       <i>OutgoingInterface=</i>
           Specifies the outgoing device to match. The outgoing
           interface is only available for packets originating from

           Added in version 236.

       <i>L3MasterDevice=</i>
           A boolean. Specifies whether the rule is to direct lookups to
           the tables associated with level 3 master devices (also known
           as Virtual Routing and Forwarding or VRF devices). For
           further details see <b>Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)</b>[23].

           Specifies the source IP port or IP port range match in
           forwarding information base (FIB) rules. A port range is
           specified by the lower and upper port separated by a dash.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>DestinationPort=</i>
           Specifies the destination IP port or IP port range match in

           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>IPProtocol=</i>
           Specifies the IP protocol to match in forwarding information
           base (FIB) rules. Takes IP protocol name such as "tcp", "udp"
           or "sctp", or IP protocol number such as "6" for "tcp" or
           "17" for "udp". Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>Family=</i>
           Takes a special value "ipv4", "ipv6", or "both". By default,
           the address family is determined by the address specified in
           <i>To=</i> or <i>From=</i>. If neither <i>To=</i> nor <i>From=</i> are specified, then
           defaults to "ipv4".

           Added in version 243.

       <i>User=</i>
           Takes a username, a user ID, or a range of user IDs separated
           by a dash. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 245.

       <i>SuppressPrefixLength=</i>
           Takes a number <i>N</i> in the range 0...128 and rejects routing
           decisions that have a prefix length of <i>N</i> or less. Defaults to
           unset.

           Added in version 245.

       <i>SuppressInterfaceGroup=</i>
           Takes an integer in the range 0...2147483647 and rejects
           routing decisions that have an interface with the same group
           id. It has the same meaning as <b>suppress_ifgroup </b>in <b>ip rule</b>.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>Type=</i>
           Specifies Routing Policy Database (RPDB) rule type. Takes one
           of "blackhole", "unreachable" or "prohibit".

           Added in version 248.
</pre> <h2>
[NEXTHOP] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [NextHop] section is used to manipulate entries in the
       kernel's "nexthop" tables. The [NextHop] section accepts the
       following settings. Specify several [NextHop] sections to
       configure several hops.

       <i>Id=</i>
           The id of the next hop. Takes an integer in the range
           1...4294967295. This is mandatory if <i>ManageForeignNextHops=no</i>
           is specified in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>. Otherwise, if unspecified,
           an unused ID will be automatically picked.

           Added in version 244.

       <i>Gateway=</i>
           As in the [Network] section.

           Added in version 244.

       <i>Family=</i>
           Takes one of the special values "ipv4" or "ipv6". By default,
           the family is determined by the address specified in
           <i>Gateway=</i>. If <i>Gateway=</i> is not specified, then defaults to
           "ipv4".

           Added in version 248.

       <i>OnLink=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, the kernel does not have to
           check if the gateway is reachable directly by the current
           machine (i.e., attached to the local network), so that we can
           insert the nexthop in the kernel table without it being
           complained about. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 248.

       <i>Blackhole=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If enabled, packets to the corresponding
           routes are discarded silently, and <i>Gateway=</i> cannot be
           specified. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 248.

       <i>Group=</i>
           Takes a whitespace separated list of nexthop IDs. Each ID
           must be in the range 1...4294967295. Optionally, each nexthop
           ID can take a weight after a colon ("<i>id</i>[:<i>weight</i>]"). The
           weight must be in the range 1...255. If the weight is not
           specified, then it is assumed that the weight is 1. This
           setting cannot be specified with <i>Gateway=</i>, <i>Family=</i>,
           <i>Blackhole=</i>. This setting can be specified multiple times. If
           an empty string is assigned, then the all previous
           assignments are cleared. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 249.
</pre> <h2>
[ROUTE] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [Route] section accepts the following settings. Specify
       several [Route] sections to configure several routes.

       <i>Gateway=</i>
           Takes the gateway address or the special values "_dhcp4" and
           "_ipv6ra". If "_dhcp4" or "_ipv6ra" is set, then the gateway
           address provided by DHCPv4 or IPv6 RA is used.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>GatewayOnLink=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, the kernel does not have to
           check if the gateway is reachable directly by the current
           machine (i.e., attached to the local network), so that we can
           insert the route in the kernel table without it being
           complained about. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 234.

       <i>Destination=</i>
           The destination prefix of the route. Possibly followed by a
           slash and the prefix length. If omitted, a full-length host
           route is assumed.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>Source=</i>
           The source prefix of the route. Possibly followed by a slash
           and the prefix length. If omitted, a full-length host route
           is assumed.

           Added in version 218.

       <i>Metric=</i>
           The metric of the route. Takes an unsigned integer in the
           range 0...4294967295. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's
           default will be used.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>IPv6Preference=</i>
           Specifies the route preference as defined in <b>RFC 4191</b>[24] for
           Router Discovery messages. Which can be one of "low" the
           route has a lowest priority, "medium" the route has a default
           priority or "high" the route has a highest priority.

           Added in version 234.

       <i>Scope=</i>
           The scope of the IPv4 route, which can be "global", "site",
           "link", "host", or "nowhere":

           •   "global" means the route can reach hosts more than one
               hop away.

           •   "site" means an interior route in the local autonomous
               system.

           •   "link" means the route can only reach hosts on the local
               network (one hop away).

           •   "host" means the route will not leave the local machine
               (used for internal addresses like 127.0.0.1).

           •   "nowhere" means the destination doesn't exist.

           For IPv4 route, defaults to "host" if <i>Type=</i> is "local" or
           "nat", and "link" if <i>Type=</i> is "broadcast", "multicast",
           "anycast", or "unicast". In other cases, defaults to
           "global". The value is not used for IPv6.

           Added in version 219.

       <i>PreferredSource=</i>
           The preferred source address of the route. The address must
           be in the format described in <a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton(3)</a>.

           Added in version 227.

       <i>Table=</i>
           The table identifier for the route. Takes one of predefined
           names "default", "main", and "local", and names defined in
           <i>RouteTable=</i> in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>, or a number between 1 and
           4294967295. The table can be retrieved using <b>ip route show</b>
           <b>table </b><i>num</i>. If unset and <i>Type=</i> is "local", "broadcast",
           "anycast", or "nat", then "local" is used. In other cases,
           defaults to "main". Ignored if <i>L3MasterDevice=</i> is true.

           Added in version 230.

       <i>HopLimit=</i>
           Configures per route hop limit. Takes an integer in the range
           1...255. See also <i>IPv6HopLimit=</i>.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>Protocol=</i>
           The protocol identifier for the route. Takes a number between
           0 and 255 or the special values "kernel", "boot", "static",
           "ra" and "dhcp". Defaults to "static".

           Added in version 234.

       <i>Type=</i>
           Specifies the type for the route. Takes one of "unicast",
           "local", "broadcast", "anycast", "multicast", "blackhole",
           "unreachable", "prohibit", "throw", "nat", and "xresolve". If
           "unicast", a regular route is defined, i.e. a route
           indicating the path to take to a destination network address.
           If "blackhole", packets to the defined route are discarded
           silently. If "unreachable", packets to the defined route are
           discarded and the ICMP message "Host Unreachable" is
           generated. If "prohibit", packets to the defined route are
           discarded and the ICMP message "Communication
           Administratively Prohibited" is generated. If "throw", route
           lookup in the current routing table will fail and the route
           selection process will return to Routing Policy Database
           (RPDB). Defaults to "unicast".

           Added in version 235.

       <i>InitialCongestionWindow=</i>
           The TCP initial congestion window is used during the start of
           a TCP connection. During the start of a TCP session, when a
           client requests a resource, the server's initial congestion
           window determines how many packets will be sent during the
           initial burst of data without waiting for acknowledgement.
           Takes a number between 1 and 1023. Note that 100 is
           considered an extremely large value for this option. When
           unset, the kernel's default (typically 10) will be used.

           Added in version 237.

       <i>InitialAdvertisedReceiveWindow=</i>
           The TCP initial advertised receive window is the amount of
           receive data (in bytes) that can initially be buffered at one
           time on a connection. The sending host can send only that
           amount of data before waiting for an acknowledgment and
           window update from the receiving host. Takes a number between
           1 and 1023. Note that 100 is considered an extremely large
           value for this option. When unset, the kernel's default will
           be used.

           Added in version 237.

       <i>QuickAck=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the TCP quick ACK mode for the
           route is enabled. When unset, the kernel's default will be
           used.

           Added in version 237.

       <i>FastOpenNoCookie=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true enables TCP fastopen without a
           cookie on a per-route basis. When unset, the kernel's default
           will be used.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>MTUBytes=</i>
           The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the route.
           The usual suffixes K, M, G, are supported and are understood
           to the base of 1024.

           Added in version 239.

       <i>TCPAdvertisedMaximumSegmentSize=</i>
           Specifies the Path MSS (in bytes) hints given on TCP layer.
           The usual suffixes K, M, G, are supported and are understood
           to the base of 1024. An unsigned integer in the range
           1...4294967294. When unset, the kernel's default will be
           used.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>TCPCongestionControlAlgorithm=</i>
           Specifies the TCP congestion control algorithm for the route.
           Takes a name of the algorithm, e.g.  "bbr", "dctcp", or
           "vegas". When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 252.

       <i>TCPRetransmissionTimeoutSec=</i>
           Specifies the TCP Retransmission Timeout (RTO) for the route.
           Takes time values in seconds. This value specifies the
           timeout of an alive TCP connection, when retransmissions
           remain unacknowledged. When unset, the kernel's default will
           be used.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>MultiPathRoute=address[@name] [weight]</i>
           Configures multipath route. Multipath routing is the
           technique of using multiple alternative paths through a
           network. Takes gateway address. Optionally, takes a network
           interface name or index separated with "@", and a weight in
           1..256 for this multipath route separated with whitespace.
           This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty
           string is assigned, then the all previous assignments are
           cleared.

           Added in version 245.

       <i>NextHop=</i>
           Specifies the nexthop id. Takes an unsigned integer in the
           range 1...4294967295. If set, the corresponding [NextHop]
           section must be configured. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 248.
</pre> <h2>
[DHCPV4] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [DHCPv4] section configures the DHCPv4 client, if it is
       enabled with the <i>DHCP=</i> setting described above:

       <i>RequestAddress=</i>
           Takes an IPv4 address. When specified, the Requested IP
           Address option (option code 50) is added with it to the
           initial DHCPDISCOVER message sent by the DHCP client.
           Defaults to unset, and an already assigned dynamic address to
           the interface is automatically picked.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>SendHostname=</i>
           When true (the default), the machine's hostname (or the value
           specified with <i>Hostname=</i>, described below) will be sent to
           the DHCP server. Note that the hostname must consist only of
           7-bit ASCII lower-case characters and no spaces or dots, and
           be formatted as a valid DNS domain name. Otherwise, the
           hostname is not sent even if this option is true.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>Hostname=</i>
           Use this value for the hostname which is sent to the DHCP
           server, instead of machine's hostname. Note that the
           specified hostname must consist only of 7-bit ASCII
           lower-case characters and no spaces or dots, and be formatted
           as a valid DNS domain name.

           Added in version 223.

       <i>MUDURL=</i>
           When configured, the specified Manufacturer Usage Description
           (MUD) URL will be sent to the DHCPv4 server. Takes a URL of
           length up to 255 characters. A superficial verification that
           the string is a valid URL will be performed. DHCPv4 clients
           are intended to have at most one MUD URL associated with
           them. See <b>RFC 8520</b>[25].

           MUD is an embedded software standard defined by the IETF that
           allows IoT device makers to advertise device specifications,
           including the intended communication patterns for their
           device when it connects to the network. The network can then
           use this to author a context-specific access policy, so the
           device functions only within those parameters.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>ClientIdentifier=</i>
           The DHCPv4 client identifier to use. Takes one of <b>mac </b>or
           <b>duid</b>. If set to <b>mac</b>, the MAC address of the link is used. If
           set to <b>duid</b>, an RFC4361-compliant Client ID, which is the
           combination of IAID and DUID, is used. IAID can be configured
           by <i>IAID=</i>. DUID can be configured by <i>DUIDType=</i> and
           <i>DUIDRawData=</i>. Defaults to <b>duid</b>.

           Added in version 220.

       <i>VendorClassIdentifier=</i>
           The vendor class identifier used to identify vendor type and
           configuration.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>UserClass=</i>
           A DHCPv4 client can use UserClass option to identify the type
           or category of user or applications it represents. The
           information contained in this option is a string that
           represents the user class of which the client is a member.
           Each class sets an identifying string of information to be
           used by the DHCP service to classify clients. Takes a
           whitespace-separated list of strings.

           Added in version 239.

       <i>DUIDType=</i>
           Override the global <i>DUIDType=</i> setting for this network. See
           <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a> for a description of possible values.

           Added in version 230.

       <i>DUIDRawData=</i>
           Override the global <i>DUIDRawData=</i> setting for this network.
           See <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a> for a description of possible values.

           Added in version 230.

       <i>IAID=</i>
           The DHCP Identity Association Identifier (IAID) for the
           interface, a 32-bit unsigned integer.

           Added in version 230.

       <i>RapidCommit=</i>
           Takes a boolean. The DHCPv4 client can obtain configuration
           parameters from a DHCPv4 server through a rapid two-message
           exchange (discover and ack). When the rapid commit option is
           set by both the DHCPv4 client and the DHCPv4 server, the
           two-message exchange is used. Otherwise, the four-message
           exchange (discover, offer, request, and ack) is used. The
           two-message exchange provides faster client configuration.
           See <b>RFC 4039</b>[26] for details. Defaults to true when
           <i>Anonymize=no</i> and neither <i>AllowList=</i> nor <i>DenyList=</i> is
           specified, and false otherwise.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>Anonymize=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the options sent to the DHCP
           server will follow the <b>RFC 7844</b>[27] (Anonymity Profiles for
           DHCP Clients) to minimize disclosure of identifying
           information. Defaults to false.

           This option should only be set to true when <i>MACAddressPolicy=</i>
           is set to <b>random </b>(see <a href="systemd.link.5.html">systemd.link(5)</a>).

           When true, <i>ClientIdentifier=mac</i>, <i>RapidCommit=no</i>,
           <i>SendHostname=no</i>, <i>Use6RD=no</i>, <i>UseCaptivePortal=no</i>, <i>UseMTU=no</i>,
           <i>UseNTP=no</i>, <i>UseSIP=no</i>, and <i>UseTimezone=no</i> are implied and
           these settings in the .network file are silently ignored.
           Also, <i>Hostname=</i>, <i>MUDURL=</i>, <i>RequestAddress=</i>, <i>RequestOptions=</i>,
           <i>SendOption=</i>, <i>SendVendorOption=</i>, <i>UserClass=</i>, and
           <i>VendorClassIdentifier=</i> are silently ignored.

           With this option enabled DHCP requests will mimic those
           generated by Microsoft Windows, in order to reduce the
           ability to fingerprint and recognize installations. This
           means DHCP request sizes will grow and lease data will be
           more comprehensive than normally, though most of the
           requested data is not actually used.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>RequestOptions=</i>
           Sets request options to be sent to the server in the DHCPv4
           request options list. A whitespace-separated list of integers
           in the range 1...254. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 244.

       <i>SendOption=</i>
           Send an arbitrary raw option in the DHCPv4 request. Takes a
           DHCP option number, data type and data separated with a colon
           ("<i>option</i>:<i>type</i>:<i>value</i>"). The option number must be an integer
           in the range 1...254. The type takes one of "uint8",
           "uint16", "uint32", "ipv4address", or "string". Special
           characters in the data string may be escaped using <b>C-style</b>
           <b>escapes</b>[28]. This setting can be specified multiple times. If
           an empty string is specified, then all options specified
           earlier are cleared. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 244.

       <i>SendVendorOption=</i>
           Send an arbitrary vendor option in the DHCPv4 request. Takes
           a DHCP option number, data type and data separated with a
           colon ("<i>option</i>:<i>type</i>:<i>value</i>"). The option number must be an
           integer in the range 1...254. The type takes one of "uint8",
           "uint16", "uint32", "ipv4address", or "string". Special
           characters in the data string may be escaped using <b>C-style</b>
           <b>escapes</b>[28]. This setting can be specified multiple times. If
           an empty string is specified, then all options specified
           earlier are cleared. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>IPServiceType=</i>
           Takes one of the special values "none", "CS6", or "CS4". When
           "none" no IP service type is set to the packet sent from the
           DHCPv4 client. When "CS6" (network control) or "CS4"
           (realtime), the corresponding service type will be set.
           Defaults to "CS6".

           Added in version 244.

       <i>SocketPriority=</i>
           The Linux socket option <b>SO_PRIORITY </b>applied to the raw IP
           socket used for initial DHCPv4 messages. Unset by default.
           Usual values range from 0 to 6. More details about
           <b>SO_PRIORITY </b>socket option in <a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket(7)</a>. Can be used in
           conjunction with [VLAN] section <i>EgressQOSMaps=</i> setting of
           .netdev file to set the 802.1Q VLAN ethernet tagged header
           priority, see <a href="systemd.netdev.5.html">systemd.netdev(5)</a>.

           Added in version 253.

       <i>Label=</i>
           Specifies the label for the IPv4 address received from the
           DHCP server. The label must be a 7-bit ASCII string with a
           length of 1...15 characters. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>UseDNS=</i>
           When true (the default), the DNS servers received from the
           DHCP server will be used.

           This corresponds to the <b>nameserver </b>option in <a href="resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf(5)</a>.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>RoutesToDNS=</i>
           When true, the routes to the DNS servers received from the
           DHCP server will be configured. When <i>UseDNS=</i> is disabled,
           this setting is ignored. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>UseNTP=</i>
           When true (the default), the NTP servers received from the
           DHCP server will be used by systemd-timesyncd.service.

           Added in version 220.

       <i>RoutesToNTP=</i>
           When true, the routes to the NTP servers received from the
           DHCP server will be configured. When <i>UseNTP=</i> is disabled,
           this setting is ignored. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 249.

       <i>UseSIP=</i>
           When true (the default), the SIP servers received from the
           DHCP server will be collected and made available to client
           programs.

           Added in version 244.

       <i>UseCaptivePortal=</i>
           When true (the default), the captive portal advertised by the
           DHCP server will be recorded and made available to client
           programs and displayed in the <a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl(1)</a> status output
           per-link.

           Added in version 254.

       <i>UseMTU=</i>
           When true, the interface maximum transmission unit from the
           DHCP server will be used on the current link. If <i>MTUBytes=</i> is
           set, then this setting is ignored. Defaults to false.

           Note, some drivers will reset the interfaces if the MTU is
           changed. For such interfaces, please try to use
           <i>IgnoreCarrierLoss=</i> with a short timespan, e.g.  "3 seconds".

           Added in version 211.

       <i>UseHostname=</i>
           When true (the default), the hostname received from the DHCP
           server will be set as the transient hostname of the system.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>UseDomains=</i>
           Takes a boolean, or the special value <b>route</b>. When true, the
           domain name received from the DHCP server will be used as DNS
           search domain over this link, similarly to the effect of the
           <b>Domains= </b>setting. If set to <b>route</b>, the domain name received
           from the DHCP server will be used for routing DNS queries
           only, but not for searching, similarly to the effect of the
           <b>Domains= </b>setting when the argument is prefixed with "~".

           When unspecified, the value specified in the same setting in
           the [Network] section will be used. When it is unspecified,
           the value specified in the same setting in the [DHCPv4]
           section in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a> will be used. When it is
           unspecified, the value specified in the same setting in the
           [Network] section in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a> will be used. When none
           of them are specified, defaults to "no".

           It is recommended to enable this option only on trusted
           networks, as setting this affects resolution of all
           hostnames, in particular of single-label names. It is
           generally safer to use the supplied domain only as routing
           domain, rather than as search domain, in order to not have it
           affect local resolution of single-label names.

           When set to true, this setting corresponds to the <b>domain</b>
           option in <a href="resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf(5)</a>.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>UseRoutes=</i>
           When true (the default), the static routes will be requested
           from the DHCP server and added to the routing table with a
           metric of 1024, and a scope of <b>global</b>, <b>link </b>or <b>host</b>,
           depending on the route's destination and gateway. If the
           destination is on the local host, e.g., 127.x.x.x, or the
           same as the link's own address, the scope will be set to
           <b>host</b>. Otherwise if the gateway is null (a direct route), a
           <b>link </b>scope will be used. For anything else, scope defaults to
           <b>global</b>.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>RouteMetric=</i>
           Set the routing metric for routes specified by the DHCP
           server (including the prefix route added for the specified
           prefix). Takes an unsigned integer in the range
           0...4294967295. Defaults to 1024.

           Added in version 217.

       <i>RouteTable=num</i>
           The table identifier for DHCP routes. Takes one of predefined
           names "default", "main", and "local", and names defined in
           <i>RouteTable=</i> in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>, or a number between
           1...4294967295.

           When used in combination with <i>VRF=</i>, the VRF's routing table
           is used when this parameter is not specified.

           Added in version 232.

       <i>RouteMTUBytes=</i>
           Specifies the MTU for the DHCP routes. Please see the [Route]
           section for further details.

           Added in version 245.

       <i>QuickAck=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the TCP quick ACK mode is enabled
           for the routes configured by the acquired DHCPv4 lease. When
           unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 253.

       <i>InitialCongestionWindow=</i>
           As in the [Route] section.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>InitialAdvertisedReceiveWindow=</i>
           As in the [Route] section.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>UseGateway=</i>
           When true, and the DHCP server provides a Router option, the
           default gateway based on the router address will be
           configured. Defaults to unset, and the value specified with
           <i>UseRoutes=</i> will be used.

           Note, when the server provides both the Router and Classless
           Static Routes option, and <i>UseRoutes=</i> is enabled, the Router
           option is always ignored regardless of this setting. See <b>RFC</b>
           <b>3442</b>[29].

           Added in version 246.

       <i>UseTimezone=</i>
           When true, the timezone received from the DHCP server will be
           set as timezone of the local system. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 226.

       <i>Use6RD=</i>
           When true, subnets of the received IPv6 prefix are assigned
           to downstream interfaces which enables <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</i>.
           See also <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</i> in the [Network] section, the
           [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section, and <b>RFC 5969</b>[30]. Defaults to
           false.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>IPv6OnlyMode=</i>
           When true, the DHCPv4 configuration will be delayed by the
           timespan provided by the DHCP server and skip to configure
           dynamic IPv4 network connectivity if IPv6 connectivity is
           provided within the timespan. See <b>RFC 8925</b>[31]. Defaults to
           false.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>FallbackLeaseLifetimeSec=</i>
           Allows one to set DHCPv4 lease lifetime when DHCPv4 server
           does not send the lease lifetime. Takes one of "forever" or
           "infinity". If specified, the acquired address never expires.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>RequestBroadcast=</i>
           Request the server to use broadcast messages before the IP
           address has been configured. This is necessary for devices
           that cannot receive RAW packets, or that cannot receive
           packets at all before an IP address has been configured. On
           the other hand, this must not be enabled on networks where
           broadcasts are filtered out.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>MaxAttempts=</i>
           Specifies how many times the DHCPv4 client configuration
           should be attempted. Takes a number or "infinity". Defaults
           to "infinity". Note that the time between retries is
           increased exponentially, up to approximately one per minute,
           so the network will not be overloaded even if this number is
           high. The default is suitable in most circumstances.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>ListenPort=</i>
           Set the port from which the DHCP client packets originate.

           Added in version 233.

       <i>ServerPort=</i>
           Set the port on which the DHCP server is listening.

           Added in version 256.

       <i>DenyList=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv4 addresses. Each address
           can optionally take a prefix length after "/". DHCP offers
           from servers in the list are rejected. Note that if
           <i>AllowList=</i> is configured then <i>DenyList=</i> is ignored.

           Note that this filters only DHCP offers, so the filtering
           might not work when <i>RapidCommit=</i> is enabled. See also
           <i>RapidCommit=</i> in the above.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>AllowList=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv4 addresses. Each address
           can optionally take a prefix length after "/". DHCP offers
           from servers in the list are accepted.

           Note that this filters only DHCP offers, so the filtering
           might not work when <i>RapidCommit=</i> is enabled. See also
           <i>RapidCommit=</i> in the above.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>SendRelease=</i>
           When true, the DHCPv4 client sends a DHCP release packet when
           it stops. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>SendDecline=</i>
           A boolean. When true, <b>systemd-networkd </b>performs IPv4
           Duplicate Address Detection to the acquired address by the
           DHCPv4 client. If duplicate is detected, the DHCPv4 client
           rejects the address by sending a <b>DHCPDECLINE </b>packet to the
           DHCP server, and tries to obtain an IP address again. See <b>RFC</b>
           <b>5227</b>[13]. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 245.

       <i>NetLabel=</i>
           This applies the NetLabel for the addresses received with
           DHCP, like <i>NetLabel=</i> in [Address] section applies it to
           statically configured addresses. See <i>NetLabel=</i> in [Address]
           section for more details.

           Added in version 252.

       <i>NFTSet=</i>
           This applies the NFT set for the network configuration
           received with DHCP, like <i>NFTSet=</i> in [Address] section applies
           it to static configuration. See <i>NFTSet=</i> in [Address] section
           for more details. For "address" or "prefix" source types, the
           type of the element used in the NFT filter must be
           "ipv4_addr".

           Added in version 255.
</pre> <h2>
[DHCPV6] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [DHCPv6] section configures the DHCPv6 client, if it is
       enabled with the <i>DHCP=</i> setting described above, or invoked by the
       IPv6 Router Advertisement:

       <i>MUDURL=</i>, <i>IAID=</i>, <i>DUIDType=</i>, <i>DUIDRawData=</i>, <i>RequestOptions=</i>
           As in the [DHCPv4] section.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>SendOption=</i>
           As in the [DHCPv4] section, however because DHCPv6 uses
           16-bit fields to store option numbers, the option number is
           an integer in the range 1...65536.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>SendVendorOption=</i>
           Send an arbitrary vendor option in the DHCPv6 request. Takes
           an enterprise identifier, DHCP option number, data type, and
           data separated with a colon ("<i>enterprise</i>
           <i>identifier</i>:<i>option</i>:<i>type</i>:<i>value</i>"). Enterprise identifier is an
           unsigned integer in the range 1...4294967294. The option
           number must be an integer in the range 1...254. Data type
           takes one of "uint8", "uint16", "uint32", "ipv4address",
           "ipv6address", or "string". Special characters in the data
           string may be escaped using <b>C-style escapes</b>[28]. This setting
           can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is
           specified, then all options specified earlier are cleared.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>UserClass=</i>
           A DHCPv6 client can use User Class option to identify the
           type or category of user or applications it represents. The
           information contained in this option is a string that
           represents the user class of which the client is a member.
           Each class sets an identifying string of information to be
           used by the DHCP service to classify clients. Special
           characters in the data string may be escaped using <b>C-style</b>
           <b>escapes</b>[28]. This setting can be specified multiple times. If
           an empty string is specified, then all options specified
           earlier are cleared. Takes a whitespace-separated list of
           strings. Note that currently <b>NUL </b>bytes are not allowed.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>VendorClass=</i>
           A DHCPv6 client can use VendorClass option to identify the
           vendor that manufactured the hardware on which the client is
           running. The information contained in the data area of this
           option is contained in one or more opaque fields that
           identify details of the hardware configuration. Takes a
           whitespace-separated list of strings.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>PrefixDelegationHint=</i>
           Takes an IPv6 address with prefix length in the same format
           as the <i>Address=</i> in the [Network] section. The DHCPv6 client
           will include a prefix hint in the DHCPv6 solicitation sent to
           the server. The prefix length must be in the range 1...128.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 244.

       <i>RapidCommit=</i>
           Takes a boolean. The DHCPv6 client can obtain configuration
           parameters from a DHCPv6 server through a rapid two-message
           exchange (solicit and reply). When the rapid commit option is
           set by both the DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server, the
           two-message exchange is used. Otherwise, the four-message
           exchange (solicit, advertise, request, and reply) is used.
           The two-message exchange provides faster client
           configuration. See <b>RFC 3315</b>[32] for details. Defaults to
           true, and the two-message exchange will be used if the server
           support it.

           Added in version 252.

       <i>SendHostname=</i>
           When true (the default), the machine's hostname (or the value
           specified with <i>Hostname=</i>, described below) will be sent to
           the DHCPv6 server. Note that the hostname must consist only
           of 7-bit ASCII lower-case characters and no spaces or dots,
           and be formatted as a valid DNS domain name. Otherwise, the
           hostname is not sent even if this option is true.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>Hostname=</i>
           Use this value for the hostname which is sent to the DHCPv6
           server, instead of machine's hostname. Note that the
           specified hostname must consist only of 7-bit ASCII
           lower-case characters and no spaces or dots, and be formatted
           as a valid DNS domain name.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>UseAddress=</i>
           When true (the default), the IP addresses provided by the
           DHCPv6 server will be assigned.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>UseCaptivePortal=</i>
           When true (the default), the captive portal advertised by the
           DHCPv6 server will be recorded and made available to client
           programs and displayed in the <a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl(1)</a> status output
           per-link.

           Added in version 254.

       <i>UseDelegatedPrefix=</i>
           When true (the default), the client will request the DHCPv6
           server to delegate prefixes. If the server provides prefixes
           to be delegated, then subnets of the prefixes are assigned to
           the interfaces that have <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=yes</i>. See also
           the <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</i> setting in the [Network] section,
           settings in the [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section, and <b>RFC</b>

       <i>UseDNS=</i>, <i>UseNTP=</i>, <i>UseHostname=</i>, <i>UseDomains=</i>, <i>NetLabel=</i>,
       <i>SendRelease=</i>
           As in the [DHCPv4] section.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>NFTSet=</i>
           This applies the NFT set for the network configuration
           received with DHCP, like <i>NFTSet=</i> in [Address] section applies
           it to static configuration. See <i>NFTSet=</i> in [Address] section
           for more details. For "address" or "prefix" source types, the
           type of the element used in the NFT filter must be
           "ipv6_addr".

           Added in version 255.

       <i>WithoutRA=</i>
           Allows DHCPv6 client to start without router advertisements's
           "managed" or "other configuration" flag. Takes one of "no",
           "solicit", or "information-request". If this is not
           specified, "solicit" is used when <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</i> is
           enabled and <i>UplinkInterface=:self</i> is specified in the
           [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section. Otherwise, defaults to "no",
           and the DHCPv6 client will be started when an RA is received.
           See also the <i>DHCPv6Client=</i> setting in the [IPv6AcceptRA]
           section.

           Added in version 246.
</pre> <h2>
[DHCPPREFIXDELEGATION] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section configures subnet prefixes of
       the delegated prefixes acquired by a DHCPv6 client or by a DHCPv4
       client through the 6RD option on another interface. The settings
       in this section are used only when the <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</i>
       setting in the [Network] section is enabled.

       <i>UplinkInterface=</i>
           Specifies the name or the index of the uplink interface, or
           one of the special values ":self" and ":auto". When ":self",
           the interface itself is considered the uplink interface, and
           <i>WithoutRA=solicit</i> is implied if the setting is not explicitly
           specified. When ":auto", the first link which acquired
           prefixes to be delegated from the DHCPv6 or DHCPv4 server is
           selected. Defaults to ":auto".

           Added in version 250.

       <i>SubnetId=</i>
           Configure a specific subnet ID on the interface from a
           (previously) received prefix delegation. You can either set
           "auto" (the default) or a specific subnet ID (as defined in
           <b>RFC 4291</b>[34], section 2.5.4), in which case the allowed value
           is hexadecimal, from 0 to 0x7fffffffffffffff inclusive.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>Announce=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When enabled, and <i>IPv6SendRA=</i> in [Network]
           section is enabled, the delegated prefixes are distributed
           through the IPv6 Router Advertisement. This setting will be
           ignored when the <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</i> setting is enabled on
           the upstream interface. Defaults to yes.

           Added in version 247.

       <i>Assign=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Specifies whether to add an address from the
           delegated prefixes which are received from the WAN interface
           by the DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation. When true (on LAN
           interface), the EUI-64 algorithm will be used by default to
           form an interface identifier from the delegated prefixes. See
           also <i>Token=</i> setting below. Defaults to yes.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>Token=</i>
           Specifies an optional address generation mode for assigning
           an address in each delegated prefix. This accepts the same
           syntax as <i>Token=</i> in the [IPv6AcceptRA] section. If <i>Assign=</i> is
           set to false, then this setting will be ignored. Defaults to
           unset, which means the EUI-64 algorithm will be used.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>ManageTemporaryAddress=</i>
           As in the [Address] section, but defaults to true.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>RouteMetric=</i>
           The metric of the route to the delegated prefix subnet. Takes
           an unsigned integer in the range 0...4294967295. When set to
           0, the kernel's default value is used. Defaults to 256.

           Added in version 249.

       <i>NetLabel=</i>
           This applies the NetLabel for the addresses received with
           DHCP, like <i>NetLabel=</i> in [Address] section applies it to
           statically configured addresses. See <i>NetLabel=</i> in [Address]
           section for more details.

           Added in version 252.

       <i>NFTSet=</i>
           This applies the NFT set for the network configuration
           received with DHCP, like <i>NFTSet=</i> in [Address] section applies
           it to static configuration. See <i>NFTSet=</i> in [Address] section
           for more details. For "address" or "prefix" source types, the
           type of the element used in the NFT filter must be
           "ipv6_addr".

           Added in version 255.

[IPV6ACCEPTRA] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [IPv6AcceptRA] section configures the IPv6 Router
       Advertisement (RA) client, if it is enabled with the
       <i>IPv6AcceptRA=</i> setting described above:

       <i>UseRedirect=</i>
           When true (the default), Redirect message sent by the current
           first-hop router will be accepted, and configures routes to
           redirected nodes will be configured.

           Added in version 256.

       <i>Token=</i>
           Specifies an optional address generation mode for the
           Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC). The following
           values are supported:

           <b>eui64</b>
               The EUI-64 algorithm will be used to generate an address
               for that prefix. Only supported by Ethernet or InfiniBand
               interfaces.

               Added in version 250.

           <b>static:</b><i>ADDRESS</i>
               An IPv6 address must be specified after a colon (":"),
               and the lower bits of the supplied address are combined
               with the upper bits of a prefix received in a Router
               Advertisement (RA) message to form a complete address.
               Note that if multiple prefixes are received in an RA
               message, or in multiple RA messages, addresses will be
               formed from each of them using the supplied address. This
               mode implements SLAAC but uses a static interface
               identifier instead of an identifier generated by using
               the EUI-64 algorithm. Because the interface identifier is
               static, if Duplicate Address Detection detects that the
               computed address is a duplicate (in use by another node
               on the link), then this mode will fail to provide an
               address for that prefix. If an IPv6 address without mode
               is specified, then "static" mode is assumed.

               Added in version 250.

           <b>prefixstable[:</b><i>ADDRESS</i><b>][,</b><i>UUID</i><b>]</b>
               The algorithm specified in <b>RFC 7217</b>[35] will be used to
               generate interface identifiers. This mode can optionally
               take an IPv6 address separated with a colon (":"). If an
               IPv6 address is specified, then an interface identifier
               is generated only when a prefix received in an RA message
               matches the supplied address.

               This mode can also optionally take a non-null UUID in the
               format which <b>sd_id128_from_string() </b>accepts, e.g.
               "86b123b969ba4b7eb8b3d8605123525a" or
               "86b123b9-69ba-4b7e-b8b3-d8605123525a". If a UUID is
               specified, the value is used as the secret key to
               generate interface identifiers. If not specified, then an
               application specific ID generated with the system's
               machine-ID will be used as the secret key. See
               <a href="../man3/sd-id128.3.html">sd-id128(3)</a>, <a href="../man3/sd_id128_from_string.3.html">sd_id128_from_string(3)</a>, and
               <a href="../man3/sd_id128_get_machine.3.html">sd_id128_get_machine(3)</a>.

               Note that the "prefixstable" algorithm uses both the
               interface name and MAC address as input to the hash to
               compute the interface identifier, so if either of those
               are changed the resulting interface identifier (and
               address) will be changed, even if the prefix received in
               the RA message has not been changed.

               Added in version 250.

           If no address generation mode is specified (which is the
           default), or a received prefix does not match any of the
           addresses provided in "prefixstable" mode, then the EUI-64
           algorithm will be used for Ethernet or InfiniBand interfaces,
           otherwise "prefixstable" will be used to form an interface
           identifier for that prefix.

           This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty
           string is assigned, then the all previous assignments are
           cleared.

           Examples:

               Token=eui64
               Token=::1a:2b:3c:4d
               Token=static:::1a:2b:3c:4d
               Token=prefixstable
               Token=prefixstable:2002:da8:1::

           Added in version 250.

       <i>UseDNS=</i>
           When true (the default), the DNS servers received in the
           Router Advertisement will be used.

           This corresponds to the <b>nameserver </b>option in <a href="resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf(5)</a>.

           Added in version 231.

       <i>UseDomains=</i>
           Takes a boolean, or the special value "route". When true, the
           domain name received via IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) will
           be used as DNS search domain over this link, similarly to the
           effect of the <b>Domains= </b>setting. If set to "route", the domain
           name received via IPv6 RA will be used for routing DNS
           queries only, but not for searching, similarly to the effect
           of the <b>Domains= </b>setting when the argument is prefixed with
           "~". Defaults to false.

           It is recommended to enable this option only on trusted
           networks, as setting this affects resolution of all
           hostnames, in particular of single-label names. It is
           generally safer to use the supplied domain only as routing
           domain, rather than as search domain, in order to not have it
           affect local resolution of single-label names.

           When set to true, this setting corresponds to the <b>domain</b>
           option in <a href="resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf(5)</a>.

           Added in version 231.

       <i>RouteTable=num</i>
           The table identifier for the routes received in the Router
           Advertisement. Takes one of predefined names "default",
           "main", and "local", and names defined in <i>RouteTable=</i> in
           <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>, or a number between 1...4294967295.

           When used in combination with <i>VRF=</i>, the VRF's routing table
           is used when this parameter is not specified.

           Added in version 232.

       <i>RouteMetric=</i>
           Set the routing metric for the routes received in the Router
           Advertisement. Takes an unsigned integer in the range
           0...4294967295, or three unsigned integer separated with ":",
           in that case the first one is used when the router preference
           is high, the second is for medium preference, and the last is
           for low preference ("<i>high</i>:<i>medium</i>:<i>low</i>"). Defaults to
           "512:1024:2048".

           Added in version 249.

       <i>QuickAck=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the TCP quick ACK mode is enabled
           for the routes configured by the received RAs. When unset,
           the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 253.

       <i>UseMTU=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the MTU received in the Router
           Advertisement will be used. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>UseHopLimit=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the hop limit received in the
           Router Advertisement will be set to routes configured based
           on the advertisement. See also <i>IPv6HopLimit=</i>. Defaults to
           true.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>UseReachableTime=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the reachable time received in
           the Router Advertisement will be set on the interface
           receiving the advertisement. It is used as the base timespan
           of the validity of a neighbor entry. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 256.

       <i>UseRetransmissionTime=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the retransmission time received
           in the Router Advertisement will be set on the interface
           receiving the advertisement. It is used as the time between
           retransmissions of Neighbor Solicitation messages to a
           neighbor when resolving the address or when probing the
           reachability of a neighbor. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 256.

       <i>UseGateway=</i>
           When true (the default), the router address will be
           configured as the default gateway.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>UseRoutePrefix=</i>
           When true (the default), the routes corresponding to the
           route prefixes received in the Router Advertisement will be
           configured.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>UseCaptivePortal=</i>
           When true (the default), the captive portal received in the
           Router Advertisement will be recorded and made available to
           client programs and displayed in the <a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl(1)</a> status
           output per-link.

           Added in version 254.

       <i>UsePREF64=</i>
           When true, the IPv6 PREF64 (or NAT64) prefixes received in
           the Router Advertisement will be recorded and made available
           to client programs and displayed in the <a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl(1)</a> status
           output per-link. See <b>RFC 8781</b>[36]. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>UseAutonomousPrefix=</i>
           When true (the default), the autonomous prefix received in
           the Router Advertisement will be used and take precedence
           over any statically configured ones.

           Added in version 242.

       <i>UseOnLinkPrefix=</i>
           When true (the default), the onlink prefix received in the
           Router Advertisement will be used and takes precedence over
           any statically configured ones.

           Added in version 242.

       <i>RouterDenyList=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 router addresses. Each
           address can optionally take a prefix length after "/". Any
           information advertised by the listed router is ignored.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>RouterAllowList=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 router addresses. Each
           address can optionally take a prefix length after "/". Only
           information advertised by the listed router is accepted. Note
           that if <i>RouterAllowList=</i> is configured then <i>RouterDenyList=</i>
           is ignored.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>PrefixDenyList=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 prefixes. Each prefix can
           optionally take its prefix length after "/". IPv6 prefixes
           supplied via router advertisements in the list are ignored.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>PrefixAllowList=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 prefixes. Each prefix can
           optionally take its prefix length after "/". IPv6 prefixes
           supplied via router advertisements in the list are allowed.
           Note that if <i>PrefixAllowList=</i> is configured then
           <i>PrefixDenyList=</i> is ignored.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>RouteDenyList=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 route prefixes. Each
           prefix can optionally take its prefix length after "/". IPv6
           route prefixes supplied via router advertisements in the list
           are ignored.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>RouteAllowList=</i>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 route prefixes. Each
           prefix can optionally take its prefix length after "/". IPv6
           route prefixes supplied via router advertisements in the list
           are allowed. Note that if <i>RouteAllowList=</i> is configured then
           <i>RouteDenyList=</i> is ignored.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>DHCPv6Client=</i>
           Takes a boolean, or the special value "always". When true,
           the DHCPv6 client will be started in "solicit" mode if the RA
           has the "managed" flag or "information-request" mode if the
           RA lacks the "managed" flag but has the "other configuration"
           flag. If set to "always", the DHCPv6 client will be started
           in "solicit" mode when an RA is received, even if neither the
           "managed" nor the "other configuration" flag is set in the
           RA. This will be ignored when <i>WithoutRA=</i> in the [DHCPv6]
           section is enabled, or <i>UplinkInterface=:self</i> in the
           [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section is specified. Defaults to
           true.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>NetLabel=</i>
           This applies the NetLabel for the addresses received with RA,
           like <i>NetLabel=</i> in [Address] section applies it to statically
           configured addresses. See <i>NetLabel=</i> in [Address] section for
           more details.

           Added in version 252.

       <i>NFTSet=</i>
           This applies the NFT set for the network configuration
           received with RA, like <i>NFTSet=</i> in [Address] section applies
           it to static configuration. See <i>NFTSet=</i> in [Address] section
           for more details. For "address" or "prefix" source types, the
           type of the element used in the NFT filter must be
           "ipv6_addr".

           Added in version 255.
</pre> <h2>
[DHCPSERVER] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [DHCPServer] section contains settings for the DHCP server,
       if enabled via the <i>DHCPServer=</i> option described above:

       <i>ServerAddress=</i>
           Specifies the server address for the DHCP server. Takes an
           IPv4 address with prefix length separated with a slash, e.g.
           "192.168.0.1/24". Defaults to unset, and one of static IPv4
           addresses configured in [Network] or [Address] section will
           be automatically selected. This setting may be useful when
           the interface on which the DHCP server is running has
           multiple static IPv4 addresses.

           This implies <i>Address=</i> in [Network] or [Address] section with
           the same address and prefix length. That is,

               [Network]
               DHCPServer=yes
               Address=192.168.0.1/24
               Address=192.168.0.2/24
               [DHCPServer]
               ServerAddress=192.168.0.1/24

           or

               [Network]
               DHCPServer=yes
               [Address]
               Address=192.168.0.1/24
               [Address]
               Address=192.168.0.2/24
               [DHCPServer]
               ServerAddress=192.168.0.1/24

           are equivalent to the following:

               [Network]
               DHCPServer=yes
               Address=192.168.0.2/24
               [DHCPServer]
               ServerAddress=192.168.0.1/24

           Since version 255, like the <i>Address=</i> setting in [Network] or
           [Address] section, this also supports a null address, e.g.
           "0.0.0.0/24", and an unused address will be automatically
           selected. For more details about the automatic address
           selection, see <i>Address=</i> setting in [Network] section in the
           above.

           Added in version 249.

       <i>PoolOffset=</i>, <i>PoolSize=</i>
           Configures the pool of addresses to hand out. The pool is a
           contiguous sequence of IP addresses in the subnet configured
           for the server address, which does not include the subnet nor
           the broadcast address.  <i>PoolOffset=</i> takes the offset of the
           pool from the start of subnet, or zero to use the default
           value.  <i>PoolSize=</i> takes the number of IP addresses in the
           pool or zero to use the default value. By default, the pool
           starts at the first address after the subnet address and
           takes up the rest of the subnet, excluding the broadcast
           address. If the pool includes the server address (the
           default), this is reserved and not handed out to clients.

           Added in version 226.

       <i>DefaultLeaseTimeSec=</i>, <i>MaxLeaseTimeSec=</i>
           Control the default and maximum DHCP lease time to pass to
           clients. These settings take time values in seconds or
           another common time unit, depending on the suffix. The
           default lease time is used for clients that did not ask for a
           specific lease time. If a client asks for a lease time longer
           than the maximum lease time, it is automatically shortened to
           the specified time. The default lease time defaults to 1h,
           the maximum lease time to 12h. Shorter lease times are
           beneficial if the configuration data in DHCP leases changes
           frequently and clients shall learn the new settings with
           shorter latencies. Longer lease times reduce the generated
           DHCP network traffic.

           Added in version 226.

       <i>UplinkInterface=</i>
           Specifies the name or the index of the uplink interface, or
           one of the special values ":none" and ":auto". When emitting
           DNS, NTP, or SIP servers is enabled but no servers are
           specified, the servers configured in the uplink interface
           will be emitted. When ":auto", the link which has a default
           gateway with the highest priority will be automatically
           selected. When ":none", no uplink interface will be selected.
           Defaults to ":auto".

           Added in version 249.

       <i>EmitDNS=</i>, <i>DNS=</i>
           <i>EmitDNS=</i> takes a boolean. Configures whether the DHCP leases
           handed out to clients shall contain DNS server information.
           Defaults to "yes". The DNS servers to pass to clients may be
           configured with the <i>DNS=</i> option, which takes a list of IPv4
           addresses, or special value "_server_address" which will be
           converted to the address used by the DHCP server.

           If the <i>EmitDNS=</i> option is enabled but no servers configured,
           the servers are automatically propagated from an "uplink"
           interface that has appropriate servers set. The "uplink"
           interface is determined by the default route of the system
           with the highest priority. Note that this information is
           acquired at the time the lease is handed out, and does not
           take uplink interfaces into account that acquire DNS server
           information at a later point. If no suitable uplink interface
           is found the DNS server data from /etc/resolv.conf is used.
           Also, note that the leases are not refreshed if the uplink
           network configuration changes. To ensure clients regularly
           acquire the most current uplink DNS server information, it is
           thus advisable to shorten the DHCP lease time via
           <i>MaxLeaseTimeSec=</i> described above.

           This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty
           string is specified, then all DNS servers specified earlier
           are cleared.

           Added in version 226.

       <i>EmitNTP=</i>, <i>NTP=</i>, <i>EmitSIP=</i>, <i>SIP=</i>, <i>EmitPOP3=</i>, <i>POP3=</i>, <i>EmitSMTP=</i>,
       <i>SMTP=</i>, <i>EmitLPR=</i>, <i>LPR=</i>
           Similar to the <i>EmitDNS=</i> and <i>DNS=</i> settings described above,
           these settings configure whether and what server information
           for the indicate protocol shall be emitted as part of the
           DHCP lease. The same syntax, propagation semantics and
           defaults apply as for <i>EmitDNS=</i> and <i>DNS=</i>.

           Added in version 226.

       <i>EmitRouter=</i>, <i>Router=</i>
           The <i>EmitRouter=</i> setting takes a boolean value, and configures
           whether the DHCP lease should contain the router option. The
           <i>Router=</i> setting takes an IPv4 address, and configures the
           router address to be emitted. When the <i>Router=</i> setting is not
           specified, then the server address will be used for the
           router option. When the <i>EmitRouter=</i> setting is disabled, the
           <i>Router=</i> setting will be ignored. The <i>EmitRouter=</i> setting
           defaults to true, and the <i>Router=</i> setting defaults to unset.

           Added in version 230.

       <i>EmitTimezone=</i>, <i>Timezone=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures whether the DHCP leases handed
           out to clients shall contain timezone information. Defaults
           to "yes". The <i>Timezone=</i> setting takes a timezone string (such
           as "Europe/Berlin" or "UTC") to pass to clients. If no
           explicit timezone is set, the system timezone of the local
           host is propagated, as determined by the /etc/localtime
           symlink.

           Added in version 226.

       <i>BootServerAddress=</i>
           Takes an IPv4 address of the boot server used by e.g. PXE
           boot systems. When specified, this address is sent in the
           <b>siaddr </b>field of the DHCP message header. See <b>RFC 2131</b>[37] for
           more details. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>BootServerName=</i>
           Takes a name of the boot server used by e.g. PXE boot
           systems. When specified, this name is sent in the DHCP option
           66 ("TFTP server name"). See <b>RFC 2132</b>[38] for more details.
           Defaults to unset.

           Note that typically setting one of <i>BootServerName=</i> or
           <i>BootServerAddress=</i> is sufficient, but both can be set too, if
           desired.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>BootFilename=</i>
           Takes a path or URL to a file loaded by e.g. a PXE boot
           loader. When specified, this path is sent in the DHCP option
           67 ("Bootfile name"). See <b>RFC 2132</b>[38] for more details.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>IPv6OnlyPreferredSec=</i>
           Takes a timespan. Controls the <b>RFC 8925</b>[31] IPv6-Only
           Preferred option. Specifies the DHCPv4 option to indicate
           that a host supports an IPv6-only mode and is willing to
           forgo obtaining an IPv4 address if the network provides IPv6
           connectivity. Defaults to unset, and not send the option. The
           minimum allowed value is 300 seconds.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>SendOption=</i>
           Send a raw option with value via DHCPv4 server. Takes a DHCP
           option number, data type and data ("<i>option</i>:<i>type</i>:<i>value</i>"). The
           option number is an integer in the range 1...254. The type
           takes one of "uint8", "uint16", "uint32", "ipv4address",
           "ipv6address", or "string". Special characters in the data
           string may be escaped using <b>C-style escapes</b>[28]. This setting
           can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is
           specified, then all options specified earlier are cleared.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 244.

       <i>SendVendorOption=</i>
           Send a vendor option with value via DHCPv4 server. Takes a
           DHCP option number, data type and data ("<i>option</i>:<i>type</i>:<i>value</i>").
           The option number is an integer in the range 1...254. The
           type takes one of "uint8", "uint16", "uint32", "ipv4address",
           or "string". Special characters in the data string may be
           escaped using <b>C-style escapes</b>[28]. This setting can be
           specified multiple times. If an empty string is specified,
           then all options specified earlier are cleared. Defaults to
           unset.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>BindToInterface=</i>
           Takes a boolean value. When "yes", DHCP server socket will be
           bound to its network interface and all socket communication
           will be restricted to this interface. Defaults to "yes",
           except if <i>RelayTarget=</i> is used (see below), in which case it
           defaults to "no".

           Added in version 249.

       <i>RelayTarget=</i>
           Takes an IPv4 address, which must be in the format described
           in <a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton(3)</a>. Turns this DHCP server into a DHCP relay
           agent. See <b>RFC 1542</b>[39]. The address is the address of DHCP
           server or another relay agent to forward DHCP messages to and
           from.

           Added in version 249.

       <i>RelayAgentCircuitId=</i>
           Specifies value for Agent Circuit ID suboption of Relay Agent
           Information option. Takes a string, which must be in the
           format "string:<i>value</i>", where "<i>value</i>" should be replaced with
           the value of the suboption. Defaults to unset (means no Agent
           Circuit ID suboption is generated). Ignored if <i>RelayTarget=</i>
           is not specified.

           Added in version 249.

       <i>RelayAgentRemoteId=</i>
           Specifies value for Agent Remote ID suboption of Relay Agent
           Information option. Takes a string, which must be in the
           format "string:<i>value</i>", where "<i>value</i>" should be replaced with
           the value of the suboption. Defaults to unset (means no Agent
           Remote ID suboption is generated). Ignored if <i>RelayTarget=</i> is
           not specified.

           Added in version 249.

       <i>RapidCommit=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the server supports <b>RFC 4039</b>[40].
           When a client sends a DHCPDISCOVER message with the Rapid
           Commit option to the server, then the server will reply with
           a DHCPACK message to the client, instead of DHCPOFFER.
           Defaults to true.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>PersistLeases=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the DHCP server will load and
           save leases in the persistent storage. When false, the DHCP
           server will neither load nor save leases in the persistent
           storage. Hence, bound leases will be lost when the interface
           is reconfigured e.g. by <b>networkctl reconfigure</b>, or
           systemd-networkd.service is restarted. That may cause address
           conflict on the network. So, please take an extra care when
           disable this setting. When unspecified, the value specified
           in the same setting in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>, which defaults to
           "yes", will be used.

           Added in version 256.

           Added in version 249.
</pre> <h2>
[IPV6SENDRA] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [IPv6SendRA] section contains settings for sending IPv6
       Router Advertisements and whether to act as a router, if enabled
       via the <i>IPv6SendRA=</i> option described above. IPv6 network prefixes
       or routes are defined with one or more [IPv6Prefix] or
       [IPv6RoutePrefix] sections.

       <i>Managed=</i>, <i>OtherInformation=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Controls whether a DHCPv6 server is used to
           acquire IPv6 addresses on the network link when <i>Managed=</i> is
           set to "true" or if only additional network information can
           be obtained via DHCPv6 for the network link when
           <i>OtherInformation=</i> is set to "true". Both settings default to
           "false", which means that a DHCPv6 server is not being used.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>RouterLifetimeSec=</i>
           Takes a timespan. Configures the IPv6 router lifetime in
           seconds. The value must be 0 seconds, or between 4 seconds
           and 9000 seconds. When set to 0, the host is not acting as a
           router. Defaults to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

           Added in version 235.

       <i>ReachableTimeSec=</i>
           Configures the time, used in the Neighbor Unreachability
           Detection algorithm, for which clients can assume a neighbor
           is reachable after having received a reachability
           confirmation. Takes a time span in the range 0...4294967295
           ms. When 0, clients will handle it as if the value wasn't
           specified. Defaults to 0.

           Added in version 256.

       <i>RetransmitSec=</i>
           Configures the time, used in the Neighbor Unreachability
           Detection algorithm, for which clients can use as retransmit
           time on address resolution and the Neighbor Unreachability
           Detection algorithm. Takes a time span in the range
           0...4294967295 ms. When 0, clients will handle it as if the
           value wasn't specified. Defaults to 0.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>RouterPreference=</i>
           Configures IPv6 router preference if <i>RouterLifetimeSec=</i> is
           non-zero. Valid values are "high", "medium" and "low", with
           "normal" and "default" added as synonyms for "medium" just to
           make configuration easier. See <b>RFC 4191</b>[24] for details.
           Defaults to "medium".

           Added in version 235.

       <i>HopLimit=</i>
           Configures hop limit. Takes an integer in the range 0...255.
           See also <i>IPv6HopLimit=</i>.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>UplinkInterface=</i>
           Specifies the name or the index of the uplink interface, or
           one of the special values ":none" and ":auto". When emitting
           DNS servers or search domains is enabled but no servers are
           specified, the servers configured in the uplink interface
           will be emitted. When ":auto", the value specified to the
           same setting in the [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section will be
           used if <i>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</i> is enabled, otherwise the link
           which has a default gateway with the highest priority will be
           automatically selected. When ":none", no uplink interface
           will be selected. Defaults to ":auto".

       <i>EmitDNS=</i>, <i>DNS=</i>
           <i>DNS=</i> specifies a list of recursive DNS server IPv6 addresses
           that are distributed via Router Advertisement messages when
           <i>EmitDNS=</i> is true.  <i>DNS=</i> also takes special value
           "_link_local"; in that case the IPv6 link-local address is
           distributed. If <i>DNS=</i> is empty, DNS servers are read from the
           [Network] section. If the [Network] section does not contain
           any DNS servers either, DNS servers from the uplink interface
           specified in <i>UplinkInterface=</i> will be used. When <i>EmitDNS=</i> is

       <i>EmitDomains=</i>, <i>Domains=</i>
           A list of DNS search domains distributed via Router
           Advertisement messages when <i>EmitDomains=</i> is true. If <i>Domains=</i>
           is empty, DNS search domains are read from the [Network]
           section. If the [Network] section does not contain any DNS
           search domains either, DNS search domains from the uplink
           interface specified in <i>UplinkInterface=</i> will be used. When
           <i>EmitDomains=</i> is false, no DNS search domain information is
           sent in Router Advertisement messages.  <i>EmitDomains=</i> defaults
           to true.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>DNSLifetimeSec=</i>
           Lifetime in seconds for the DNS server addresses listed in

           seconds (one hour).

           Added in version 235.

       <i>HomeAgent=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Specifies that IPv6 router advertisements
           which indicate to hosts that the router acts as a Home Agent
           and includes a Home Agent option. Defaults to false. See <b>RFC</b>
           <b>6275</b>[12] for further details.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>HomeAgentLifetimeSec=</i>
           Takes a timespan. Specifies the lifetime of the Home Agent.
           An integer, the default unit is seconds, in the range
           1...65535. Defaults to the value set to <i>RouterLifetimeSec=</i>.

           Added in version 255.

       <i>HomeAgentPreference=</i>
           Configures IPv6 Home Agent preference. Takes an integer in

       further details.

       <i>AddressAutoconfiguration=</i>, <i>OnLink=</i>
           Takes a boolean to specify whether IPv6 addresses can be
           autoconfigured with this prefix and whether the prefix can be
           used for onlink determination. Both settings default to
           "true" in order to ease configuration.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>Prefix=</i>
           The IPv6 prefix that is to be distributed to hosts. Similarly
           to configuring static IPv6 addresses, the setting is
           configured as an IPv6 prefix and its prefix length, separated
           by a "/" character. Use multiple [IPv6Prefix] sections to
           configure multiple IPv6 prefixes since prefix lifetimes,
           address autoconfiguration and onlink status may differ from
           one prefix to another.

           Added in version 235.

       <i>PreferredLifetimeSec=</i>, <i>ValidLifetimeSec=</i>
           Preferred and valid lifetimes for the prefix measured in
           seconds.  <i>PreferredLifetimeSec=</i> defaults to 1800 seconds (30
           minutes) and <i>ValidLifetimeSec=</i> defaults to 3600 seconds (one
           hour).

           Added in version 235.

       <i>Assign=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, adds an address from the prefix.
           Default to false.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>Token=</i>
           Specifies an optional address generation mode for assigning
           an address in each prefix. This accepts the same syntax as
           <i>Token=</i> in the [IPv6AcceptRA] section. If <i>Assign=</i> is set to
           false, then this setting will be ignored. Defaults to unset,
           which means the EUI-64 algorithm will be used.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>RouteMetric=</i>
           The metric of the prefix route. Takes an unsigned integer in
           the range 0...4294967295. When unset or set to 0, the
           kernel's default value is used. This setting is ignored when

           traffic for which an MDB entry is missing and the destination
           is unknown through this port. When unset, the kernel's
           default will be used.

           Added in version 242.

       <i>MulticastToUnicast=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Multicast to unicast works on top of the
           multicast snooping feature of the bridge. Which means unicast
           copies are only delivered to hosts which are interested in
           it. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>NeighborSuppression=</i>

           be used.

           Added in version 242.

       <i>HairPin=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures whether traffic may be sent back
           out of the port on which it was received. When this flag is
           false, then the bridge will not forward traffic back out of
           the receiving port. When unset, the kernel's default will be
           used.

           Added in version 223.

       <i>Isolated=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures whether this port is isolated or
           not. Within a bridge, isolated ports can only communicate
           with non-isolated ports. When set to true, this port can only
           communicate with other ports whose Isolated setting is false.
           When set to false, this port can communicate with any other
           ports. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>UseBPDU=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures whether STP Bridge Protocol Data
           Units will be processed by the bridge port. When unset, the

           Added in version 223.

       <i>FastLeave=</i>
           Takes a boolean. This flag allows the bridge to immediately
           stop multicast traffic on a port that receives an IGMP Leave
           message. It is only used with IGMP snooping if enabled on the
           bridge. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 223.

       <i>AllowPortToBeRoot=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures whether a given port is allowed
           to become a root port. Only used when STP is enabled on the
           bridge. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 223.

       <i>ProxyARP=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures whether proxy ARP to be enabled
           on this port. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           default will be used.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>MulticastRouter=</i>
           Configures this port for having multicast routers attached. A
           port with a multicast router will receive all multicast
           traffic. Takes one of "no" to disable multicast routers on
           this port, "query" to let the system detect the presence of
           routers, "permanent" to permanently enable multicast traffic
           forwarding on this port, or "temporary" to enable multicast
           routers temporarily on this port, not depending on incoming
           queries. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>Cost=</i>
           Sets the "cost" of sending packets of this interface. Each
           port in a bridge may have a different speed and the cost is
           used to decide which link to use. Faster interfaces should
           have lower costs. It is an integer value between 1 and 65535.

           Added in version 218.

       <i>Priority=</i>
           Sets the "priority" of sending packets on this interface.
           Each port in a bridge may have a different priority which is
           used to decide which link to use. Lower value means higher
           priority. It is an integer value between 0 to 63. Networkd
           does not set any default, meaning the kernel default value of
           32 is used.

           Added in version 234.

           restart of the CAN controller will be triggered automatically
           in case of a bus-off condition after the specified delay
           time. Subsecond delays can be specified using decimals (e.g.
           "0.1s") or a "ms" or "us" postfix. Using "infinity" or "0"
           will turn the automatic restart off. By default automatic
           restart is disabled.

           Added in version 239.

       <i>Termination=</i>
           Takes a boolean or a termination resistor value in ohm in the

           stuffing errors, unable to send dominant bit, unable to send
           recessive bit, bus overload, active error announcement, error
           occurred on transmission). When unset, the kernel's default
           will be used. Note: in case of a CAN bus with a single CAN
           device, sending a CAN frame may result in a huge number of
           CAN bus errors.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>ListenOnly=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When "yes", listen-only mode is enabled.
           When the interface is in listen-only mode, the interface
           neither transmit CAN frames nor send ACK bit. Listen-only
           mode is important to debug CAN networks without interfering
           with the communication or acknowledge the CAN frame. When
           unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>Loopback=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When "yes", loopback mode is enabled. When
           the loopback mode is enabled, the interface treats messages
           transmitted by itself as received messages. The loopback mode
           is important to debug CAN networks. When unset, the kernel's
           default will be used.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>OneShot=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When "yes", one-shot mode is enabled. When

           Added in version 250.

       <i>PresumeAck=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When "yes", the interface will ignore
           missing CAN ACKs. When unset, the kernel's default will be
           used.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>ClassicDataLengthCode=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When "yes", the interface will handle the
           4bit data length code (DLC). When unset, the kernel's default
           will be used.

           Added in version 250.
</pre> <h2>
[IPOIB] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [IPoIB] section manages the IP over Infiniband and accepts
       the following keys:

       <i>Mode=</i>
           Takes one of the special values "datagram" or "connected".
           Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.

           When "datagram", the Infiniband unreliable datagram (UD)
           transport is used, and so the interface MTU is equal to the
           IB L2 MTU minus the IPoIB encapsulation header (4 bytes). For
           example, in a typical IB fabric with a 2K MTU, the IPoIB MTU
           will be 2048 - 4 = 2044 bytes.

           When "connected", the Infiniband reliable connected (RC)
           transport is used. Connected mode takes advantage of the
           connected nature of the IB transport and allows an MTU up to
           the maximal IP packet size of 64K, which reduces the number
           of IP packets needed for handling large UDP datagrams, TCP
           segments, etc and increases the performance for large
           messages.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>IgnoreUserspaceMulticastGroup=</i>
           Takes an boolean value. When true, the kernel ignores
           multicast groups handled by userspace. Defaults to unset, and
           the kernel's default is used.

           Added in version 250.

               tin.

               Added in version 250.

           <b>precedence</b>
               Enables priority queueing based on the legacy
               interpretation of TOS "Precedence" field. Use of this
               preset on the modern Internet is firmly discouraged.

           values are e.g. 100us for extremely high-performance 10GigE+
           networks like datacentre, 1ms for non-WiFi LAN connections,
           100ms for typical internet connections. Defaults to unset,
           and the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 253.

       <i>AckFilter=</i>
           Takes a boolean value, or special value "aggressive". If
           enabled, ACKs in each flow are queued and redundant ACKs to
           the upstream are dropped. If yes, the filter will always keep
           at least two redundant ACKs in the queue, while in
           "aggressive" mode, it will filter down to a single ACK. This
           may improve download throughput on links with very
           asymmetrical rate limits. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's

       <i>Handle=</i>
           Configures the major number of unique identifier of the
           qdisc, known as the handle. Takes a hexadecimal number in the
           range 0x1–0xffff. Defaults to unset.

       <i>PacketLimit=</i>
           Specifies the hard limit on the queue size in number of
           packets. When this limit is reached, incoming packets are
           dropped. An unsigned integer in the range 0...4294967294.
           Defaults to unset and kernel's default is used.

</pre> <h2>
[QUICKFAIRQUEUEINGCLASS] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [QuickFairQueueingClass] section manages the traffic control
       class of Quick Fair Queueing (qfq).

       <i>Parent=</i>
           Configures the parent Queueing Discipline (qdisc). Takes one
           of "root", or a qdisc identifier. The qdisc identifier is
           specified as the major and minor numbers in hexadecimal in
           the range 0x1–0xffff separated with a colon ("major:minor").
           Defaults to "root".

       <i>ClassId=</i>
           Configures the unique identifier of the class. It is
           specified as the major and minor numbers in hexadecimal in

           Defaults to unset.

       <i>Weight=</i>
           Specifies the weight of the class. Takes an integer in the
           range 1...1023. Defaults to unset in which case the kernel
           default is used.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>MaxPacketBytes=</i>
           Specifies the maximum packet size in bytes for the class.
           When suffixed with K, M, or G, the specified size is parsed
           as Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively, to the
           base of 1024. When unset, the kernel default is used.

           Added in version 246.
</pre> <h2>
[BRIDGEVLAN] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [BridgeVLAN] section manages the VLAN ID configurations of a
       bridge master or port, and accepts the following keys. To make
       the settings in this section take an effect, <i>VLANFiltering=</i>
       option has to be enabled on the bridge master, see the [Bridge]
       section in <a href="systemd.netdev.5.html">systemd.netdev(5)</a>. If at least one valid settings
       specified in this section in a .network file for an interface,
       all assigned VLAN IDs on the interface that are not configured in
       the .network file will be removed. If VLAN IDs on an interface
       need to be managed by other tools, then the settings in this
       section cannot be used in the matching .network file.

       <i>VLAN=</i>
           The VLAN ID allowed on the port. This can be either a single
           ID or a range M-N. Takes an integer in the range 1...4094.
           This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty
           string is assigned, then the all previous assignments are
           cleared.

           Added in version 231.

       <i>EgressUntagged=</i>
           The VLAN ID specified here will be used to untag frames on
           egress. Configuring <i>EgressUntagged=</i> implicates the use of
           <i>VLAN=</i> above and will enable the VLAN ID for ingress as well.
           This can be either a single ID or a range M-N. This setting
           can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is
           assigned, then the all previous assignments are cleared.

           Added in version 231.

       <i>PVID=</i>
           The port VLAN ID specified here is assigned to all untagged
           frames at ingress. Takes an VLAN ID or negative boolean value
           (e.g.  "no"). When false, the currently assigned port VLAN ID
           will be dropped. Configuring <i>PVID=</i> implicates the use of
           <i>VLAN=</i> setting in the above and will enable the VLAN ID for
           ingress as well. Defaults to unset, and will keep the
           assigned port VLAN ID if exists.

           Added in version 231.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Example 1. Static network configuration</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/50-static.network
           [Match]
           Name=enp2s0

           [Network]
           Address=192.168.0.15/24
           Gateway=192.168.0.1

       This brings interface "enp2s0" up with a static address. The
       specified gateway will be used for a default route.

       <b>Example 2. DHCP on ethernet links</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/80-dhcp.network
           [Match]
           Name=en*

           [Network]
           DHCP=yes

       This will enable DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 on all interfaces with names
       starting with "en" (i.e. ethernet interfaces).

       <b>Example 3. IPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6 PD)</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/55-dhcpv6-pd-upstream.network
           [Match]
           Name=enp1s0

           [Network]
           DHCP=ipv6

           # The below setting is optional, to also assign an address in the delegated prefix
           # to the upstream interface. If not necessary, then comment out the line below and
           # the [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section.
           DHCPPrefixDelegation=yes

           # If the upstream network provides Router Advertisement with Managed bit set,
           # then comment out the line below and WithoutRA= setting in the [DHCPv6] section.
           IPv6AcceptRA=no

           [DHCPv6]
           WithoutRA=solicit

           [DHCPPrefixDelegation]
           UplinkInterface=:self
           SubnetId=0
           Announce=no

           # /etc/systemd/network/55-dhcpv6-pd-downstream.network
           [Match]
           Name=enp2s0

           [Network]
           DHCPPrefixDelegation=yes
           IPv6SendRA=yes

           # It is expected that the host is acting as a router. So, usually it is not
           # necessary to receive Router Advertisement from other hosts in the downstream network.
           IPv6AcceptRA=no

           [DHCPPrefixDelegation]
           UplinkInterface=enp1s0
           SubnetId=1
           Announce=yes

       This will enable DHCPv6-PD on the interface enp1s0 as an upstream
       interface where the DHCPv6 client is running and enp2s0 as a
       downstream interface where the prefix is delegated to. The
       delegated prefixes are distributed by IPv6 Router Advertisement
       on the downstream network.

       <b>Example 4. IPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv4 6RD)</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/55-dhcpv4-6rd-upstream.network
           [Match]
           Name=enp1s0

           [Network]
           DHCP=ipv4

           # When DHCPv4-6RD is used, the upstream network does not support IPv6.
           # Hence, it is not necessary to wait for Router Advertisement, which is enabled by default.
           IPv6AcceptRA=no

           [DHCPv4]
           Use6RD=yes

           # /etc/systemd/network/55-dhcpv4-6rd-downstream.network
           [Match]
           Name=enp2s0

           [Network]
           DHCPPrefixDelegation=yes
           IPv6SendRA=yes

           # It is expected that the host is acting as a router. So, usually it is not
           # necessary to receive Router Advertisement from other hosts in the downstream network.
           IPv6AcceptRA=no

           [DHCPPrefixDelegation]
           UplinkInterface=enp1s0
           SubnetId=1
           Announce=yes

       This will enable DHCPv4-6RD on the interface enp1s0 as an
       upstream interface where the DHCPv4 client is running and enp2s0
       as a downstream interface where the prefix is delegated to. The
       delegated prefixes are distributed by IPv6 Router Advertisement
       on the downstream network.

       <b>Example 5. A bridge with two enslaved links</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/25-bridge-static.netdev
           [NetDev]
           Name=bridge0
           Kind=bridge

           # /etc/systemd/network/25-bridge-static.network
           [Match]
           Name=bridge0

           [Network]
           Address=192.168.0.15/24
           Gateway=192.168.0.1
           DNS=192.168.0.1

           # /etc/systemd/network/25-bridge-slave-interface-1.network
           [Match]
           Name=enp2s0

           [Network]
           Bridge=bridge0

           # /etc/systemd/network/25-bridge-slave-interface-2.network
           [Match]
           Name=wlp3s0

           [Network]
           Bridge=bridge0

       This creates a bridge and attaches devices "enp2s0" and "wlp3s0"
       to it. The bridge will have the specified static address and
       network assigned, and a default route via the specified gateway
       will be added. The specified DNS server will be added to the
       global list of DNS resolvers.

       <b>Example 6. Bridge port with VLAN forwarding</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/25-bridge-slave-interface-1.network
           [Match]
           Name=enp2s0

           [Network]
           Bridge=bridge0

           [BridgeVLAN]
           VLAN=1-32
           PVID=42
           EgressUntagged=42

           [BridgeVLAN]
           VLAN=100-200

           [BridgeVLAN]
           EgressUntagged=300-400

       This overrides the configuration specified in the previous
       example for the interface "enp2s0", and enables VLAN on that
       bridge port. VLAN IDs 1-32, 42, 100-400 will be allowed. Packets
       tagged with VLAN IDs 42, 300-400 will be untagged when they leave
       on this interface. Untagged packets which arrive on this
       interface will be assigned VLAN ID 42.

       <b>Example 7. Various tunnels</b>

           /etc/systemd/network/25-tunnels.network
           [Match]
           Name=ens1

           [Network]
           Tunnel=ipip-tun
           Tunnel=sit-tun
           Tunnel=gre-tun
           Tunnel=vti-tun

           /etc/systemd/network/25-tunnel-ipip.netdev
           [NetDev]
           Name=ipip-tun
           Kind=ipip

           /etc/systemd/network/25-tunnel-sit.netdev
           [NetDev]
           Name=sit-tun
           Kind=sit

           /etc/systemd/network/25-tunnel-gre.netdev
           [NetDev]
           Name=gre-tun
           Kind=gre

           /etc/systemd/network/25-tunnel-vti.netdev
           [NetDev]
           Name=vti-tun
           Kind=vti

       This will bring interface "ens1" up and create an IPIP tunnel, a
       SIT tunnel, a GRE tunnel, and a VTI tunnel using it.

       <b>Example 8. A bond device</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/30-bond1.network
           [Match]
           Name=bond1

           [Network]
           DHCP=ipv6

           # /etc/systemd/network/30-bond1.netdev
           [NetDev]
           Name=bond1
           Kind=bond

           # /etc/systemd/network/30-bond1-dev1.network
           [Match]
           MACAddress=52:54:00:e9:64:41

           [Network]
           Bond=bond1

           # /etc/systemd/network/30-bond1-dev2.network
           [Match]
           MACAddress=52:54:00:e9:64:42

           [Network]
           Bond=bond1

       This will create a bond device "bond1" and enslave the two
       devices with MAC addresses 52:54:00:e9:64:41 and
       52:54:00:e9:64:42 to it. IPv6 DHCP will be used to acquire an
       address.

       <b>Example 9. Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)</b>

       Add the "bond1" interface to the VRF master interface "vrf1".
       This will redirect routes generated on this interface to be
       within the routing table defined during VRF creation. For kernels
       before 4.8 traffic won't be redirected towards the VRFs routing
       table unless specific ip-rules are added.

           # /etc/systemd/network/25-vrf.network
           [Match]
           Name=bond1

           [Network]
           VRF=vrf1

       <b>Example 10. MacVTap</b>

       This brings up a network interface "macvtap-test" and attaches it
       to "enp0s25".

           # /usr/lib/systemd/network/25-macvtap.network
           [Match]
           Name=enp0s25

           [Network]
           MACVTAP=macvtap-test

       <b>Example 11. A Xfrm interface with physical underlying device.</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/27-xfrm.netdev
           [NetDev]
           Name=xfrm0
           Kind=xfrm

           [Xfrm]
           InterfaceId=7

           # /etc/systemd/network/27-eth0.network
           [Match]
           Name=eth0

           [Network]
           Xfrm=xfrm0

       This creates a "xfrm0" interface and binds it to the "eth0"
       device. This allows hardware based ipsec offloading to the "eth0"
       nic. If offloading is not needed, xfrm interfaces can be assigned
       to the "lo" device.
