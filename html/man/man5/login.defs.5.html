</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       login.defs - shadow password suite configuration
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The /etc/login.defs file defines the site-specific configuration
       for the shadow password suite. This file is required. Absence of
       this file will not prevent system operation, but will probably
       result in undesirable operation.

       This file is a readable text file, each line of the file
       describing one configuration parameter. The lines consist of a
       configuration name and value, separated by whitespace. Blank
       lines and comment lines are ignored. Comments are introduced with
       a "#" pound sign and the pound sign must be the first non-white
       character of the line.

       Parameter values may be of four types: strings, booleans,
       numbers, and long numbers. A string is comprised of any printable
       characters. A boolean should be either the value <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>. An
       undefined boolean parameter or one with a value other than these
       will be given a <i>no</i> value. Numbers (both regular and long) may be
       either decimal values, octal values (precede the value with <i>0</i>) or
       hexadecimal values (precede the value with <i>0x</i>). The maximum value
       of the regular and long numeric parameters is machine-dependent.

       The following configuration items are provided:

       <b>CHFN_RESTRICT </b>(string)
           This parameter specifies which values in the <i>gecos</i> field of
           the /etc/passwd file may be changed by regular users using
           the <b>chfn </b>program. It can be any combination of letters <i>f</i>, <i>r</i>,
           <i>w</i>, <i>h</i>, for Full name, Room number, Work phone, and Home phone,
           respectively. For backward compatibility, <i>yes</i> is equivalent
           to <i>rwh</i> and <i>no</i> is equivalent to <i>frwh</i>. If not specified, only
           the superuser can make any changes. The most restrictive
           setting is better achieved by not installing <b>chfn </b>SUID.

       <b>CREATE_HOME </b>(boolean)
           Indicate if a home directory should be created by default for
           new users.

           This setting does not apply to system users, and can be
           overridden on the command line.

       <b>DEFAULT_HOME </b>(boolean)
           Indicate if login is allowed if we can't cd to the home
           directory. Default is no.

           If set to <i>yes</i>, the user will login in the root (/) directory
           if it is not possible to cd to her home directory.

       <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>(string)
           This defines the system default encryption algorithm for
           encrypting passwords (if no algorithm are specified on the
           command line).

           It can take one of these values: <i>DES</i> (default), <i>MD5</i>, <i>SHA256</i>,
           <i>SHA512</i>. MD5 and DES should not be used for new hashes, see
           crypt(5) for recommendations.

           Note: this parameter overrides the <b>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB </b>variable.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The
           generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to
           the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
           consistently with the PAM configuration.

       <b>ENV_PATH </b>(string)
           If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment
           variable when a regular user login. The value is a colon
           separated list of paths (for example <i>/bin:/usr/bin</i>) and can
           be preceded by <i>PATH=</i>. The default value is
           <i>PATH=/bin:/usr/bin</i>.

       <b>ENV_SUPATH </b>(string)
           If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment
           variable when the superuser login. The value is a colon
           separated list of paths (for example
           <i>/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</i>) and can be preceded by <i>PATH=</i>.
           The default value is <i>PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</i>.

       <b>ERASECHAR </b>(number)
           Terminal ERASE character (<i>010</i> = backspace, <i>0177</i> = DEL).

           The value can be prefixed "0" for an octal value, or "0x" for
           an hexadecimal value.

       <b>FAIL_DELAY </b>(number)
           Delay in seconds before being allowed another attempt after a
           login failure.

       <b>FAKE_SHELL </b>(string)
           If set, <b>login </b>will execute this shell instead of the users'
           shell specified in /etc/passwd.

       <b>GID_MAX </b>(number), <b>GID_MIN </b>(number)
           Range of group IDs used for the creation of regular groups by
           <b>useradd</b>, <b>groupadd</b>, or <b>newusers</b>.

           The default value for <b>GID_MIN </b>(resp.  <b>GID_MAX</b>) is 1000 (resp.
           60000).

       <b>HOME_MODE </b>(number)
           The mode for new home directories. If not specified, the
           <b>UMASK </b>is used to create the mode.

           <b>useradd </b>and <b>newusers </b>use this to set the mode of the home
           directory they create.

       <b>HUSHLOGIN_FILE </b>(string)
           If defined, this file can inhibit all the usual chatter
           during the login sequence. If a full pathname is specified,
           then hushed mode will be enabled if the user's name or shell
           are found in the file. If not a full pathname, then hushed
           mode will be enabled if the file exists in the user's home
           directory.

       <b>KILLCHAR </b>(number)
           Terminal KILL character (<i>025</i> = CTRL/U).

           The value can be prefixed "0" for an octal value, or "0x" for
           an hexadecimal value.

       <b>LASTLOG_UID_MAX </b>(number)
           Highest user ID number for which the lastlog entries should
           be updated. As higher user IDs are usually tracked by remote
           user identity and authentication services there is no need to
           create a huge sparse lastlog file for them.

           No <b>LASTLOG_UID_MAX </b>option present in the configuration means
           that there is no user ID limit for writing lastlog entries.

       <b>LOG_OK_LOGINS </b>(boolean)
           Enable logging of successful logins.

       <b>LOG_UNKFAIL_ENAB </b>(boolean)
           Enable display of unknown usernames when login failures are
           recorded.

           Note: logging unknown usernames may be a security issue if an
           user enter her password instead of her login name.

       <b>LOGIN_RETRIES </b>(number)
           Maximum number of login retries in case of bad password.

           This will most likely be overridden by PAM, since the default
           pam_unix module has its own built in of 3 retries. However,
           this is a safe fallback in case you are using an
           authentication module that does not enforce PAM_MAXTRIES.

       <b>LOGIN_TIMEOUT </b>(number)
           Max time in seconds for login.

       <b>MAIL_DIR </b>(string)
           The mail spool directory. This is needed to manipulate the
           mailbox when its corresponding user account is modified or
           deleted. If not specified, a compile-time default is used.
           The parameter CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL in /etc/default/useradd
           determines whether the mail spool should be created.

       <b>MAIL_FILE </b>(string)
           Defines the location of the users mail spool files relatively
           to their home directory.

       The <b>MAIL_DIR </b>and <b>MAIL_FILE </b>variables are used by <b>useradd</b>,
       <b>usermod</b>, and <b>userdel </b>to create, move, or delete the user's mail
       spool.

       <b>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP </b>(number)
           Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached,
           a new group entry (line) is started in /etc/group (with the
           same name, same password, and same GID).

           The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in
           the number of members in a group.

           This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of
           lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
           lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters.

           If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

           Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in
           the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable
           unless you really need it.

       <b>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB </b>(boolean)
           Indicate if passwords must be encrypted using the MD5-based
           algorithm. If set to <i>yes</i>, new passwords will be encrypted
           using the MD5-based algorithm compatible with the one used by
           recent releases of FreeBSD. It supports passwords of
           unlimited length and longer salt strings. Set to <i>no</i> if you
           need to copy encrypted passwords to other systems which don't
           understand the new algorithm. Default is <i>no</i>.

           This variable is superseded by the <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>variable or
           by any command line option used to configure the encryption
           algorithm.

           This variable is deprecated. You should use <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD</b>.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The
           generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to
           the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
           consistently with the PAM configuration.

       <b>NONEXISTENT </b>(string)
           If a system account intentionally does not have a home
           directory that exists, this string can be provided in the
           /etc/passwd entry for the account to indicate this. The
           result is that pwck will not emit a spurious warning for this
           account.

       <b>PASS_MAX_DAYS </b>(number)
           The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the
           password is older than this, a password change will be
           forced. If not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables
           the restriction).

       <b>PASS_MIN_DAYS </b>(number)
           The minimum number of days allowed between password changes.
           Any password changes attempted sooner than this will be
           rejected. If not specified, 0 will be assumed (which disables
           the restriction).

       <b>PASS_WARN_AGE </b>(number)
           The number of days warning given before a password expires. A
           zero means warning is given only upon the day of expiration,
           a value of -1 means no warning is given. If not specified, no
           warning will be provided.

       <b>PASS_MAX_DAYS</b>, <b>PASS_MIN_DAYS </b>and <b>PASS_WARN_AGE </b>are only used at
       the time of account creation. Any changes to these settings won't
       affect existing accounts.

       <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS </b>(number), <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS </b>(number)
           When <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>is set to <i>SHA256</i> or <i>SHA512</i>, this defines
           the number of SHA rounds used by the encryption algorithm by
           default (when the number of rounds is not specified on the
           command line).

           With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute force the
           password. But note also that more CPU resources will be
           needed to authenticate users.

           If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of
           rounds (5000), which is orders of magnitude too low for
           modern hardware.

           The values must be inside the 1000-999,999,999 range.

           If only one of the <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS </b>or
           <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS </b>values is set, then this value will be
           used.

           If <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS </b>&gt; <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS</b>, the highest
           value will be used.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The
           generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to
           the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
           consistently with the PAM configuration.

       <b>SULOG_FILE </b>(string)
           If defined, all su activity is logged to this file.

       <b>SU_NAME </b>(string)
           If defined, the command name to display when running "su -".
           For example, if this is defined as "su" then a "ps" will
           display the command is "-su". If not defined, then "ps" would
           display the name of the shell actually being run, e.g.
           something like "-sh".

       <b>SUB_GID_MIN </b>(number), <b>SUB_GID_MAX </b>(number), <b>SUB_GID_COUNT</b>
       (number)
           If /etc/subuid exists, the commands <b>useradd </b>and <b>newusers</b>
           (unless the user already have subordinate group IDs) allocate
           <b>SUB_GID_COUNT </b>unused group IDs from the range <b>SUB_GID_MIN </b>to
           <b>SUB_GID_MAX </b>for each new user.

           The default values for <b>SUB_GID_MIN</b>, <b>SUB_GID_MAX</b>,
           <b>SUB_GID_COUNT </b>are respectively 100000, 600100000 and 65536.

       <b>SUB_UID_MIN </b>(number), <b>SUB_UID_MAX </b>(number), <b>SUB_UID_COUNT</b>
       (number)
           If /etc/subuid exists, the commands <b>useradd </b>and <b>newusers</b>
           (unless the user already have subordinate user IDs) allocate
           <b>SUB_UID_COUNT </b>unused user IDs from the range <b>SUB_UID_MIN </b>to
           <b>SUB_UID_MAX </b>for each new user.

           The default values for <b>SUB_UID_MIN</b>, <b>SUB_UID_MAX</b>,
           <b>SUB_UID_COUNT </b>are respectively 100000, 600100000 and 65536.

       <b>SYS_GID_MAX </b>(number), <b>SYS_GID_MIN </b>(number)
           Range of group IDs used for the creation of system groups by
           <b>useradd</b>, <b>groupadd</b>, or <b>newusers</b>.

           The default value for <b>SYS_GID_MIN </b>(resp.  <b>SYS_GID_MAX</b>) is 101
           (resp.  <b>GID_MIN</b>-1).

       <b>SYS_UID_MAX </b>(number), <b>SYS_UID_MIN </b>(number)
           Range of user IDs used for the creation of system users by
           <b>useradd </b>or <b>newusers</b>.

           The default value for <b>SYS_UID_MIN </b>(resp.  <b>SYS_UID_MAX</b>) is 101
           (resp.  <b>UID_MIN</b>-1).

       <b>SYSLOG_SG_ENAB </b>(boolean)
           Enable "syslog" logging of <b>sg </b>activity.

       <b>SYSLOG_SU_ENAB </b>(boolean)
           Enable "syslog" logging of <b>su </b>activity - in addition to sulog
           file logging.

       <b>TTYGROUP </b>(string), <b>TTYPERM </b>(string)
           The terminal permissions: the login tty will be owned by the
           <b>TTYGROUP </b>group, and the permissions will be set to <b>TTYPERM</b>.

           <b>TTYGROUP </b>can be either the name of a group or a numeric group
           identifier.

           If TTYGROUP is not defined, then the group ownership of the
           terminal is set to the user's primary group. If TTYPERM is
           not defined, then the permissions are set to <i>0600</i>.

           If you have a <b>write </b>program which is "setgid" to a special
           group which owns the terminals, define TTYGROUP to the group
           number and TTYPERM to 0620. Otherwise leave TTYGROUP
           commented out and assign TTYPERM to either 622 or 600.

       <b>TTYTYPE_FILE </b>(string)
           If defined, file which maps tty line to TERM environment
           parameter. Each line of the file is in a format something
           like "vt100 tty01".

       <b>UID_MAX </b>(number), <b>UID_MIN </b>(number)
           Range of user IDs used for the creation of regular users by
           <b>useradd </b>or <b>newusers</b>.

           The default value for <b>UID_MIN </b>(resp.  <b>UID_MAX</b>) is 1000 (resp.
           60000).

       <b>UMASK </b>(number)
           The file mode creation mask is initialized to this value. If
           not specified, the mask will be initialized to 022.

           <b>useradd </b>and <b>newusers </b>use this mask to set the mode of the
           home directory they create if <b>HOME_MODE </b>is not set.

           It is also used by <b>pam_umask </b>as the default umask value.

       <b>USERDEL_CMD </b>(string)
           If defined, this command is run when removing a user. It
           should remove any at/cron/print jobs etc. owned by the user
           to be removed (passed as the first argument).

           The return code of the script is not taken into account.

           Here is an example script, which removes the user's cron, at
           and print jobs:

               #! /bin/sh

               # Check for the required argument.
               if [ $# != 1 ]; then
                    echo "Usage: $0 username"
                    exit 1
               fi

               # Remove cron jobs.
               crontab -r -u $1

               # Remove at jobs.
               # Note that it will remove any jobs owned by the same UID,
               # even if it was shared by a different username.
               AT_SPOOL_DIR=/var/spool/cron/atjobs
               find $AT_SPOOL_DIR -name "[^.]*" -type f -user $1 -delete \;

               # Remove print jobs.
               lprm $1

               # All done.
               exit 0

       <b>USERGROUPS_ENAB </b>(boolean)
           If set to <i>yes</i>, <b>userdel </b>will remove the user's group if it
           contains no more members, and <b>useradd </b>will create by default
           a group with the name of the user.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Much of the functionality that used to be provided by the shadow
       password suite is now handled by PAM. Thus, /etc/login.defs is no
       longer used by <a href="../man1/passwd.1.html">passwd(1)</a>, or less used by <a href="../man1/login.1.html">login(1)</a>, and <a href="../man1/su.1.html">su(1)</a>.
       Please refer to the corresponding PAM configuration files
       instead.
