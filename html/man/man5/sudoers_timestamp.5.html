NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sudoers_timestamp </b>— Sudoers Time Stamp Format
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sudoers </b>plugin uses per-user-ID time stamp files for
       credential caching.  Once a user has been authenticated, they may
       use <b>sudo </b>without a password for a short period of time (<i>5</i> minutes
       unless overridden by the <i>timestamp_timeout</i> option).  By default,
       <b>sudoers </b>uses a separate record for each terminal, which means
       that a user's login sessions are authenticated separately.  The
       <i>timestamp_type</i> option can be used to select the type of time
       stamp record <b>sudoers </b>will use.

       A multi-record time stamp file format was introduced in <b>sudo</b>
       1.8.10 that uses a single file per user.  Previously, a separate
       file was used for each user and terminal combination unless tty-
       based time stamps were disabled.  The new format is extensible
       and records of multiple types and versions may coexist within the
       same file.

       All records, regardless of type or version, begin with a 16-bit
       version number and a 16-bit record size.

       Time stamp records have the following structure:

       /* Time stamp entry types */
       #define TS_GLOBAL               0x01U   /* not restricted by tty or ppid */
       #define TS_TTY                  0x02U   /* restricted by tty */
       #define TS_PPID                 0x03U   /* restricted by ppid */
       #define TS_LOCKEXCL             0x04U   /* special lock record */

       /* Time stamp flags */
       #define TS_DISABLED             0x01U   /* entry disabled */
       #define TS_ANYUID               0x02U   /* ignore uid, only valid in key */

       struct timestamp_entry {
           unsigned short version;     /* version number */
           unsigned short size;        /* entry size */
           unsigned short type;        /* TS_GLOBAL, TS_TTY, TS_PPID */
           unsigned short flags;       /* TS_DISABLED, TS_ANYUID */
           uid_t auth_uid;             /* uid to authenticate as */
           pid_t sid;                  /* session ID associated with tty/ppid */
           struct timespec start_time; /* session/ppid start time */
           struct timespec ts;         /* time stamp (CLOCK_MONOTONIC) */
           union {
               dev_t ttydev;           /* tty device number */
               pid_t ppid;             /* parent pid */
           } u;
       };

       The timestamp_entry struct fields are as follows:

       version
             The version number of the timestamp_entry struct.  New
             entries are created with a version number of 2.  Records
             with different version numbers may coexist in the same file
             but are not inter-operable.

       size  The size of the record in bytes.

       type  The record type, currently TS_GLOBAL, TS_TTY, or TS_PPID.

       flags
             Zero or more record flags which can be bit-wise ORed
             together.  Supported flags are TS_DISABLED, for records
             disabled via <b>sudo -k </b>and TS_ANYUID, which is used only when
             matching records.

       auth_uid
             The user-ID that was used for authentication.  Depending on
             the value of the <i>rootpw</i>, <i>runaspw</i> and <i>targetpw</i> options, the
             user-ID may be that of the invoking user, the root user,
             the default runas user or the target user.

       sid   The ID of the user's terminal session, if present.  The
             session ID is only used when matching records of type
             TS_TTY.

       start_time
             The start time of the session leader for records of type
             TS_TTY or of the parent process for records of type
             TS_PPID.  The <i>start_time</i> is used to help prevent reuse of a
             time stamp record after a user has logged out.  Not all
             systems support a method to easily retrieve a process's
             start time.  The <i>start_time</i> field was added in <b>sudoers</b>
             version 1.8.22 for the second revision of the
             timestamp_entry struct.

       ts    The actual time stamp.  A monotonic time source (which does
             not move backward) is used if the system supports it.
             Where possible, <b>sudoers </b>uses a monotonic timer that
             increments even while the system is suspended.  The value
             of <i>ts</i> is updated each time a command is run via <b>sudo</b>.  If
             the difference between <i>ts</i> and the current time is less than
             the value of the <i>timestamp_timeout</i> option, no password is
             required.

       u.ttydev
             The device number of the terminal associated with the
             session for records of type TS_TTY.

       u.ppid
             The ID of the parent process for records of type TS_PPID.

       The <b>tsdump </b>utility, included with the sudo source distribution,
       can be used to display the contents of a <i>sudoers</i> time stamp file.
</pre> <h2>
LOCKING </h2>
<pre>
       In <b>sudoers </b>versions 1.8.10 through 1.8.14, the entire time stamp
       file was locked for exclusive access when reading or writing to
       the file.  Starting in <b>sudoers </b>1.8.15, individual records are
       locked in the time stamp file instead of the entire file and the
       lock is held for a longer period of time.  This scheme is
       described below.

       The first record in the time stamp file is of type TS_LOCKEXCL
       and is used as a <i>lock</i> record to prevent more than one <b>sudo</b>
       process from adding a new record at the same time.  Once the
       desired time stamp record has been located or created (and
       locked), the TS_LOCKEXCL record is unlocked.  The lock on the
       individual time stamp record, however, is held until
       authentication is complete.  This allows <b>sudoers </b>to avoid
       prompting for a password multiple times when it is used more than
       once in a pipeline.

       Records of type TS_GLOBAL cannot be locked for a long period of
       time since doing so would interfere with other <b>sudo </b>processes.
       Instead, a separate lock record is used to prevent multiple <b>sudo</b>
       processes using the same terminal (or parent process ID) from
       prompting for a password as the same time.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Originally, <b>sudo </b>used a single zero-length file per user and the
       file's modification time was used as the time stamp.  Later
       versions of <b>sudo </b>added restrictions on the ownership of the time
       stamp files and directory as well as checks on the validity of
       the time stamp itself.  Notable changes were introduced in the
       following <b>sudo </b>versions:

       1.4.0
             Support for tty-based time stamp file was added by
             appending the terminal name to the time stamp file name.

       1.6.2
             The time stamp file was replaced by a per-user directory
             which contained any tty-based time stamp files.

       1.6.3p2
             The target user name was added to the time stamp file name
             when the <i>targetpw</i> option was set.

       1.7.3
             Information about the terminal device was stored in tty-
             based time stamp files for validity checks.  This included
             the terminal device numbers, inode number and, on systems
             where it was not updated when the device was written to,
             the inode change time.  This helped prevent reuse of the
             time stamp file after logout.

       1.8.6p7
             The terminal session ID was added to tty-based time stamp
             files to prevent reuse of the time stamp by the same user
             in a different terminal session.  It also helped prevent
             reuse of the time stamp file on systems where the terminal
             device's inode change time was updated by writing.

       1.8.10
             A new, multi-record time stamp file format was introduced
             that uses a single file per user.  The terminal device's
             change time was not included since most systems now update
             the change time after a write is performed as required by
             POSIX.

       1.8.15
             Individual records are locked in the time stamp file
             instead of the entire file and the lock is held until
             authentication is complete.

       1.8.22
             The start time of the terminal session leader or parent
             process is now stored in non-global time stamp records.
             This prevents reuse of the time stamp file after logout in
             most cases.

             Support was added for the kernel-based tty time stamps
             available in OpenBSD which do not use an on-disk time stamp
             file.

       1.9.15
             Time stamp file path names are now based on the invoking
             user-ID instead of the user name.  This avoids problems
             with user names that include a path separator character.
