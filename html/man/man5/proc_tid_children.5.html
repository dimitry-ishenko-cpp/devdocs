DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>tid<i>/children</i> (since Linux 3.5)
              A space-separated list of child tasks of this task.  Each
              child task is represented by its TID.

              This option is intended for use by the checkpoint-restore
              (CRIU) system, and reliably provides a list of children
              only if all of the child processes are stopped or frozen.
              It does not work properly if children of the target task
              exit while the file is being read!  Exiting children may
              cause non-exiting children to be omitted from the list.
              This makes this interface even more unreliable than
              classic PID-based approaches if the inspected task and its
              children aren't frozen, and most code should probably not
              use this interface.

              Until Linux 4.2, the presence of this file was governed by
              the <b>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE </b>kernel configuration option.
              Since Linux 4.2, it is governed by the
              <b>CONFIG_PROC_CHILDREN </b>option.
