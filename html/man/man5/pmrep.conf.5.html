</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmrep.conf </b>- pmrep configuration file
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmrep </b>is a customizable performance metrics reporting tool.  Any
       available performance metric, live or archived, system and/or
       application, can be selected for reporting using one of the
       available output alternatives together with applicable formatting
       options.

       The metrics of interest are named in the <i>metricspec</i> argument(s)
       on the <b>pmrep </b>command line.  These metricspecs define individual
       metrics or pre-defined performance metricsets to be read from
       configuration files described below.  For command line argument
       details see <a href="../man1/pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a>.

       The <b>pmrep.conf </b>configuration file allows for setting default
       runtime values and defining any number of custom <i>metricsets</i> for
       <b>pmrep</b>.  A metricset is a user-defined arbitrary set of
       performance metrics.  This allows users to create specifically
       crafted metricsets particularly relevant for their application or
       environment.  Instead of being dependent on what existing tools
       provide or collecting the needed data with several disjoint
       utilities users can define custom metricsets by merely editing
       <b>pmrep.conf</b>.  See below for the <i>metricset</i> specification.

       In case <b>pmrep </b>configuration files are read from a directory then
       values for the <b>[options] </b>and <b>[global] </b>sections will be combined
       from each file where defined.  The last definition of a directive
       wins, meaning the last definition will be used in case defined
       multiple times.  However, custom <i>metricset</i> sections will not be
       combined, only the last definition found will be used for
       reporting.

       Options via environment values (see <a href="../man3/pmgetoptions.3.html">pmGetOptions(3)</a>) override the
       corresponding built-in default values (if any).  Configuration
       file options override the corresponding environment variables (if
       any).  Command line options override the corresponding
       configuration file options (if any).
</pre> <h2>
FILE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The file has an ini-style syntax and consists of sections and
       settings.  A section begins with the name of the section in
       square brackets and continues until the next section begins.  An
       example section with two settings follows:

           [<i>section</i>]
           <i>key</i> = <i>value</i>
           <i>key2</i> = <i>value2</i>

       The supported data types for values are string, integer, and
       boolean.  Values should not to be quoted expect when the value
       consists solely of whitespace (i.e., a whitespace-only column
       separator).

       A line comment starts with a hash sign (``#'') or a semicolon
       (``;'').  Inline comments are not supported.

       <b>pmrep.conf </b>must be readable by the user invoking <b>pmrep</b>.

       Any option described below with a corresponding command line
       option contains additional functional description in <a href="../man1/pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIAL SECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>The [options] section</b>
       The <b>[options] </b>section is read every time <b>pmrep </b>is run and it

   <b>The [global] section</b>
       The <b>[global] </b>section is used to define metrics that will be
       reported in addition to any other separately defined metric or
       metricset.  Configuration options are not allowed in this
       section.  Global metrics are reported by default, the command
       line option <b>-G </b>or the configuration file option <b>globals </b>can be
       used to disable global metrics.

       <b>Allowed settings</b>

           Only <i>metricspecs</i> are allowed in this section.  See below for
           the metricspec specification.
</pre> <h2>
CUSTOM SECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Any other section than <b>[options] </b>or <b>[global] </b>will be interpreted
       as a new <i>metricset</i> specification.  The section name is arbitrary,
       typically a reference to its coverage or purpose.  A custom
       section may contain options, metricspecs, or both.

       All the metrics specified in a custom section (metricset) will be
       reported when <b>pmrep </b>reports that particular metricset.  More than
       one metricset (custom section) can be defined on the command line
       in which case <b>pmrep </b>reports the combination of all the metrics
       specified in the selected metricsets.

       <b>Allowed settings</b>

           Any option valid in the <b>[options] </b>section is also valid in a
           custom section.  Any option or metric defined in a custom
           section will override the same option or metric possibly
           defined earlier.  See below for the metricspec specification.
</pre> <h2>
METRICSET SPECIFICATION </h2>
<pre>
       There are three forms of the <i>metricspec</i>.  First, on the command
       line a metricspec can start with a colon (``:'') to indicate a
       reference to a <i>metricset</i> (custom section) to be read from a <b>pmrep</b>
       configuration file.  Second, the <i>compact form</i> of a metricspec is
       a one-line metric specification which can be used both on the
       command line and in the <b>[global] </b>and custom sections of the
       configuration file.  The only difference of its usage in the
       configuration file is that the metric name is used as the key and
       the optional specifiers as values.  The compact form of the
       metricspec is specified in detail in <a href="../man1/pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a>.  The third,
       <i>verbose form</i> of a metricspec, is valid only in the configuration
       file (see below).

       In a custom section a key containing a dot (``.'') is interpreted
       as a metric name and a non-option key not containing a dot is
       interpreted as an identifier (handle) to bind related
       declarations together.  The identifier is arbitrary and is not
       used otherwise except for binding the below specifiers and the
       metric together.

       The verbose form of a metricspec starts with a declaration
       consisting of a mandatory <i>identifier</i> as the key and a performance
       metric name (a PMNS node) as its value.  This equals to the
       compact form of the metricspec defining the same performance
       metric without any of the optional specifiers defined.

       The following specifiers are optional in the verbose form and can
       be used as keys in any order with an earlier declared identifier
       followed by a dot and the specifier (as in <i>identifier</i>.<i>specifier</i>).
       See also the example later below.

              <i>label</i>
                Defines text label for the metric used by supporting
                output targets.

              <i>formula</i>
                Defines the needed arithmetic expression for the metric.
                For details, see <a href="../man3/pmregisterderived.3.html">pmRegisterDerived(3)</a>.

              <i>instances</i>
                Defines the instances to be reported for the metric.
                For details, see <a href="../man1/pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a>.

              <i>unit</i>
                Defines the unit/scale conversion for the metric.  Needs
                to be dimension-compatible and is used with non-string
                metrics.  For allowed values, see <a href="../man1/pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a>.

              <i>type</i>
                If set to <b>raw </b>rate conversion for the metric will be
                disabled.

              <i>width</i>
                Defines the width of the output column for the metric.

              <i>precision</i>
                Defines precision for numeric non-integer output values.

              <i>limit</i>
                Defines value limit filter for numeric metric values.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       The following example contains a short <b>[options] </b>section setting
       some locally wanted default values.  It then goes on to define
       the global metrics <b>kernel.all.sysfork </b>using the <i>compact form</i> and
       <b>mem.util.allcache </b>using the <i>verbose form</i> of a metricspec.  The
       latter is a derived metric using the specified formula.  Both of
       these metrics will be included in reporting unless disabled with
       <b>-G </b>or <b>globals = no</b>.

       Three different <i>metricsets</i> are also specified: <b>db1</b>, <b>db2</b>, and
       <b>sar-w</b>.

       The DB sets define a host to be used as the source for the
       metrics.  Both use the <i>verbose form</i> of a metricspec (as the non-
       option key <b>set </b>does not contain the dot) to include all
       <b>postgresql </b>related metrics.

       The <b>sar-w </b>set is an example how to mimic an existing tool with
       <b>pmrep</b>.

       The system default <b>pmrep </b>configuration files contain many more
       examples.  The tab key on the command line after a colon
       completes available metricsets (with bash and zsh).

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
       <a href="../man3/pmgetoptions.3.html">pmGetOptions(3)</a>.
