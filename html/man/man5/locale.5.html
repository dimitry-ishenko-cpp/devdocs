</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       locale - describes a locale definition file
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>locale </b>definition file contains all the information that the
       <a href="../man1/localedef.1.html">localedef(1)</a> command needs to convert it into the binary locale
       database.

       The definition files consist of sections which each describe a
       locale category in detail.  See <a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale(7)</a> for additional details
       for these categories.

   <b>Syntax</b>
       The locale definition file starts with a header that may consist
       of the following keywords:

       <i>escape_char</i>
              is followed by a character that should be used as the
              escape-character for the rest of the file to mark
              characters that should be interpreted in a special way.
              It defaults to the backslash (\).

       <i>comment_char</i>
              is followed by a character that will be used as the
              comment-character for the rest of the file.  It defaults
              to the number sign (#).

       The locale definition has one part for each locale category.
       Each part can be copied from another existing locale or can be
       defined from scratch.  If the category should be copied, the only
       valid keyword in the definition is <i>copy</i> followed by the name of
       the locale in double quotes which should be copied.  The
       exceptions for this rule are <b>LC_COLLATE </b>and <b>LC_CTYPE </b>where a <i>copy</i>
       statement can be followed by locale-specific rules and selected
       overrides.

       When defining a locale or a category from scratch, an existing
       system- provided locale definition file should be used as a
       reference to follow common glibc conventions.

   <b>Locale category sections</b>
       The following category sections are defined by POSIX:

       •  <b>LC_CTYPE</b>

       •  <b>LC_COLLATE</b>

       •  <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>

       •  <b>LC_MONETARY</b>

       •  <b>LC_NUMERIC</b>

       •  <b>LC_TIME</b>

       In addition, since glibc 2.2, the GNU C library supports the
       following nonstandard categories:

       •  <b>LC_ADDRESS</b>

       •  <b>LC_IDENTIFICATION</b>

       •  <b>LC_MEASUREMENT</b>

       •  <b>LC_NAME</b>

       •  <b>LC_PAPER</b>

       •  <b>LC_TELEPHONE</b>

       See <a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale(7)</a> for a more detailed description of each category.

   <b>LC_ADDRESS</b>
       The definition starts with the string <i>LC_ADDRESS</i> in the first
       column.

       The following keywords are allowed:

       <i>postal_fmt</i>
              followed by a string containing field descriptors that
              define the format used for postal addresses in the locale.
              The following field descriptors are recognized:

              %n     Person's name, possibly constructed with the
                     <b>LC_NAME </b><i>name_fmt</i> keyword (since glibc 2.24).

              %t  Insert a space if the previous descriptor's value was
                  not an empty string; otherwise ignore.

              %r  Room number, door designation.

              %e  Floor number.

              %C  Country designation, from the <i>country_post</i> keyword.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The collective GNU C library community wisdom regarding <i>abday</i>,
       <i>day</i>, <i>week</i>, <i>first_weekday</i>, and <i>first_workday</i> states at
       <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Locales">https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Locales</a> the following:

       •  The value of the second <i>week</i> list item specifies the base of
          the <i>abday</i> and <i>day</i> lists.

       •  <i>first_weekday</i> specifies the offset of the first day-of-week in
          the <i>abday</i> and <i>day</i> lists.

       •  For compatibility reasons, all glibc locales should set the
          value of the second <i>week</i> list item to <b>19971130 </b>(Sunday) and
          base the <i>abday</i> and <i>day</i> lists appropriately, and set
          <i>first_weekday</i> and <i>first_workday</i> to <b>1 </b>or <b>2</b>, depending on
          whether the week and work week actually starts on Sunday or
          Monday for the locale.
