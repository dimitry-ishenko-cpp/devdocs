INTRODUCTION </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="../man8/systemd-portabled.service.8.html">systemd-portabled.service(8)</a> is a system service that may be used
       to attach, detach and inspect portable services. This page
       describes the D-Bus interface.

THE MANAGER OBJECT </h2>
<pre>
       The service exposes the following interfaces on the Manager
       object on the bus:

   <b>Methods</b>
       <b>GetImage() </b>may be used to get the image object path of the image
       with the specified name.

       <b>ListImages() </b>returns an array of all currently known images. The
       structures in the array consist of the following fields: image
       name, type, read-only flag, creation time, modification time,
       current disk space, usage and image object path.

       <b>GetImageOSRelease() </b>retrieves the OS release information of an
       image. This method returns an array of key value pairs read from
       the <a href="os-release.5.html">os-release(5)</a> file in the image and is useful to identify the
       operating system used in a portable service.

       <b>GetImageMetadata() </b>retrieves metadata associated with an image.
       This method returns the image name, the image's <a href="os-release.5.html">os-release(5)</a>
       content in the form of a (streamable) array of bytes, and a list
       of portable units contained in the image, in the form of a string
       (unit name) and an array of bytes with the content.

       <b>GetImageMetadataWithExtensions() </b>retrieves metadata associated
       with an image. This method is a superset of <b>GetImageMetadata()</b>
       with the addition of a list of extensions as input parameter,
       which were overlaid on top of the main image via
       <b>AttachImageWithExtensions()</b>. The path of each extension and an
       array of bytes with the content of the respective
       extension-release file are returned, one such structure for each
       extension named in the input arguments.

       <b>GetImageState() </b>retrieves the image state as one of the following
       strings:

       •   detached

       •   attached

       •   attached-runtime

       •   enabled

       •   enabled-runtime

       •   running

       •   running-runtime

       <b>GetImageStateWithExtensions() </b>is a superset of <b>GetImageState()</b>,
       with additional support for a list of extensions as input
       parameters, which is necessary to query the state in case the
       image was attached in that particular way. The <i>flag</i> parameter is
       currently unused and reserved for future purposes.

       <b>AttachImage() </b>attaches a portable image to the system. This
       method takes an image path or name, a list of strings that will
       be used to search for unit files inside the image (partial or
       complete matches), a string indicating which portable profile to
       use for the image (see <i>Profiles</i> property for a list of available
       profiles), a boolean indicating whether to attach the image only
       for the current boot session, and a string representing the
       preferred copy mode (whether to copy the image or to just symlink
       it) with the following possible values:

       •   (empty)

       •   copy

       •   symlink

       •   mixed

       If an empty string is passed the security profile drop-ins and
       images will be symlinked while unit files will be copied, <i>copy</i>
       will copy, <i>symlink</i> will prefer linking if possible (e.g.: a unit
       has to be copied out of an image), and <i>mixed</i> will prefer linking
       the resources owned by the OS (e.g.: the portable profile located
       within the host's /usr/ tree) but will copy the resources owned
       by the portable image (e.g.: the unit files and the images). This
       method returns the list of changes applied to the system (for
       example, which unit was added and is now available as a system
       service). Each change is represented as a triplet of strings: the
       type of change applied, the path on which it was applied, and the
       source (if any). The type of change applied will be one of the
       following possible values:

       •   copy

       •   symlink

       •   write

       •   mkdir

       Note that an image cannot be attached if a unit that it contains
       is already present on the system. Note that this method returns
       only after all the listed operations are completed, and due to
       the I/O involved it might take some time.

       In place of the image path a ".v/" versioned directory may be
       specified, see <a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v(7)</a> for details.

       In place of the directory path a ".v/" versioned directory may be
       specified, see <a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v(7)</a> for details.

       <b>AttachImageWithExtensions() </b>attaches a portable image to the
       system. This method is a superset of <b>AttachImage() </b>with the
       addition of a list of extensions as input parameter, which will
       be overlaid on top of the main image. When this method is used,
       detaching must be done by passing the same arguments via the
       <b>DetachImageWithExtensions() </b>method. For more details on this
       functionality, see the <i>MountImages=</i> entry on <a href="systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a> and
       <a href="../man8/systemd-sysext.8.html">systemd-sysext(8)</a>.

       <b>DetachImage() </b>detaches a portable image from the system. This
       method takes an image path or name, and a boolean indicating
       whether the image to detach was attached only for the current
       boot session or persistently. This method returns the list of
       changes applied to the system (for example, which unit was
       removed and is no longer available as a system service). Each
       change is represented as a triplet of strings: the type of change
       applied, the path on which it was applied, and the source (if
       any). The type of change applied will be one of the following
       possible values:

       •   unlink

       Note that an image cannot be detached if a unit that it contains
       is running. Note that this method returns only after all the
       listed operations are completed, and due to the I/O involved it
       might take some time.

       <b>DetachImageWithExtensions() </b>detaches a portable image from the
       system. This method is a superset of <b>DetachImage() </b>with the
       addition of a list of extensions as input parameter, which were
       overlaid on top of the main image via
       <b>AttachImageWithExtensions()</b>.

       <b>ReattachImage() </b>combines the effects of the <b>AttachImage() </b>method
       and the <b>DetachImage() </b>method. The difference is that it is
       allowed to reattach an image while one or more of its units are
       running. The reattach operation will fail if no matching image is
       attached. The input parameters match the <b>AttachImage() </b>method,
       and the return parameters are the combination of the return
       parameters of the <b>DetachImage() </b>method (first array, units that
       were removed) and the <b>AttachImage() </b>method (second array, units
       that were updated or added).

       <b>ReattachImageWithExtensions() </b>reattaches a portable image to the
       system. This method is a superset of <b>ReattachImage() </b>with the
       addition of a list of extensions as input parameter, which will
       be overlaid on top of the main image. For more details on this
       functionality, see the <i>MountImages=</i> entry on <a href="systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a> and
       <a href="../man8/systemd-sysext.8.html">systemd-sysext(8)</a>.

       <b>RemoveImage() </b>removes the image with the specified name.

       <b>MarkImageReadOnly() </b>toggles the read-only flag of an image.

       <b>SetPoolLimit() </b>sets an overall quota limit on the pool of images.

       <b>SetImageLimit() </b>sets a per-image quota limit.

       The <b>AttachImageWithExtensions()</b>, <b>DetachImageWithExtensions() </b>and
       <b>ReattachImageWithExtensions() </b>methods take in options as flags
       instead of booleans to allow for extendability.
       <i>SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_ATTACH</i> will bypass the safety checks
       that ensure the units are not running while the image is attached
       or detached.  <i>SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_EXTENSION</i> will bypass the
       check that ensures the extension-release.<i>NAME</i> file in the
       extension image matches the image name. They are defined as
       follows:

           #define SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_RUNTIME            (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 0)
           #define SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_ATTACH       (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 1)
           #define SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_EXTENSION    (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 2)

   <b>Properties</b>
       <i>PoolPath</i> specifies the file system path where images are written
       to.

       <i>PoolUsage</i> specifies the current usage size of the image pool in
       bytes.

       <i>PoolLimit</i> specifies the size limit of the image pool in bytes.

       <i>Profiles</i> specifies the available runtime profiles for portable
       services.

   <b>Methods</b>
       The following methods implement the same operation as the
       respective methods on the Manager object (see above). However,
       these methods operate on the image object and hence does not take
       an image name parameter. Invoking the methods directly on the
       Manager object has the advantage of not requiring a <b>GetImage()</b>
       call to get the image object for a specific image name. Calling
       the methods on the Manager object is hence a round trip
       optimization. List of methods:

       •   GetOSRelease()

       •   GetMetadata()

       •   GetMetadataWithExtensions()

       •   GetState()

       •   Attach()

       •   AttachWithExtensions()

       •   Detach()

       •   DetachWithExtensions()

       •   Reattach()

       •   ReattachWithExtensions()

       •   Remove()

       •   MarkReadOnly()

       •   SetLimit()

   <b>Properties</b>
       <i>Name</i> specifies the image name.

       <i>Path</i> specifies the file system path where image is stored.

       <i>Type</i> specifies the image type.

       <i>ReadOnly</i> specifies whether the image is read-only.

       <i>CreationTimestamp</i> specifies the image creation timestamp.

       <i>ModificationTimestamp</i> specifies the image modification timestamp.

       <i>Usage</i> specifies the image disk usage.

       <i>Limit</i> specifies the image disk usage limit.

       <i>UsageExclusive</i> specifies the image disk usage (exclusive).

       <i>LimitExclusive</i> specifies the image disk usage limit (exclusive).
