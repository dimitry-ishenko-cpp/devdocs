NAME </h2>
<pre>
       setrans.conf - translation configuration file for MCS/MLS SELinux
       systems
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>/etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/setrans.conf</i> configuration file
       specifies the way that SELinux MCS/MLS labels are translated into
       human readable form by the mcstransd daemon.  The default
       policies support 16 sensitivity levels (s0 through s15) and 1024
       categories (c0 through c1023). Multiple categories can be
       separated with commas (c0,c1,c3,c5) and a range of categories can
       be shortened using dot notation (c0.c3,c5).

   <b>Keywords</b>
       Base   once a base is declared, subsequent sensitivity label
              definitions will have all modifiers applied to them during
              translation.  Sensitivity labels defined before the base
              declaration are immediately cached and no modifiers will
              be applied these are used as direct translations.

       Default
              defines the category bit range that will be used for
              inverse bits.

       Domain creates a new domain with the supplied name.

       Include
              read and process the contents of the specified
              configuration file.

       Join   defines a character used to separate members of a modifier
              group when more than one is specified (ex. USA/AUS).

       ModifierGroup
              a means of grouping category bit definitions by how they
              modify the sensitivity label.

       Prefix word(s) that may proceed member(s) of a modifier group
              (ex. REL USA).

       Suffix word(s) that may follow member(s) of a modifier group (ex.
              USA EYES ONLY).

       Whitespace
              defines the set of acceptable white space characters that
              may be used in label being translated.

   <b>Sensitivity Level Definition Examples</b>
       s0=SystemLow
              defines a translation of s0 (the lowest sensitivity level)
              with no categories to SystemLow.

       s15:c0.c1023=SystemHigh
              defines a translation of s15:c0.c1023 to SystemHigh.
              c0.c1023 is shorthand for all categories. A colon
              separates the sensitivity level and categories.

       s0-s15:c0.c1023=SystemLow-SystemHigh
              defines a range translation of s0-s15:c0.c1023 to
              SystemLow-SystemHigh. The two range components are
              separated by a dash.

       s0:c0=PatientRecord
              defines a translation of sensitivity s0 with category c0
              to PatientRecord.

       s0:c1=Accounting
              defines a translation of sensitivity s0 with category c1
              to Accounting.

       s2:c1,c2,c3=Confidential3Categories

       s2:c1.c3=Confidential3Categories
              both define a translation of sensitivity s2 with
              categories c1, c2 and c3 to Confidential3Categories.

       s5=TopSecret
              defines a translation of sensitivity s5 with no categories
              to TopSecret.

   <b>Constraint Examples</b>
       c0!c1  if category bits 0 and 1 are both set, the constraint will
              fail and the original context will be returned.

       c5.c9&gt;c1
              if category bits 5 through 9 are set, bit 1 must also be
              set or the constraint will fail and the original context
              will be returned.

       s1!c5,c9
              if category bits 5 and 9 are set and the sensitivity level
              is s1, the constraint will fail and the original context
              will be returned.
