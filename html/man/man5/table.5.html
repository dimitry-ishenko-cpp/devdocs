NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>table </b>— format description for smtpd tables
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page documents the file format for the various tables
       used in the <i>smtpd</i>(8) mail daemon.

       The format described here applies to tables as defined in
       <i>smtpd.conf</i>(5).
</pre> <h2>
TABLE TYPES </h2>
<pre>
       There are two types of tables: lists and mappings.  A list
       consists of a series of values, while a mapping consists of a
       series of keys and their associated values.  The following
       illustrates how to declare them as static tables:

             table mylist { value1, value2, value3 }
             table mymapping { key1 = value1, key2 = value2, key3 = value3 }

       When using a ‘file’ table, a list will be written with each value
       on a line by itself.

             value1
             value2
             value3

       A mapping will be written with each key and value on a line,
       whitespace and an optional colon separating both columns:

             key1:   value1
             key2    value2
             key3    value3

       Blank lines, leading and trailing spaces and tabs are ignored.
       Lines whose first non-space character is a hash mark (‘#’) are
       comments and are ignored.  To force the parsing of a file table
       as a list rather than a mapping, use this special comment:

             <b># @list</b>

       A file table can be converted to a Berkeley database using the
       <i>makemap</i>(8) utility with no syntax change.

       Tables using a ‘file’ or Berkeley DB backend will be referenced
       as follows:

             <b>table </b><i>name</i> <b>file</b>:<i>/path/to/file</i>
             <b>table </b><i>name</i> <b>db</b>:<i>/path/to/file.db</i>

   <b>Aliasing tables</b>
       Aliasing tables are mappings that associate a recipient to one or
       many destinations.  They can be used in two contexts: primary
       domain aliases and virtual domain mapping.

             <b>action </b><i>name method</i> <b>alias </b>&lt;table&gt;
             <b>action </b><i>name method</i> <b>virtual </b>&lt;table&gt;

       In a primary domain context, the key is the user part of the
       recipient address, whilst the value is one or many recipients as
       described in <i>aliases</i>(5):

             user1   otheruser
             user2   otheruser1,otheruser2
             user3   otheruser@example.com

       In a virtual domain context, the key is either a user part, a
       full email address or a catch-all, following selection rules
       described in <i>smtpd.conf</i>(5), and the value is one or many
       recipients as described in <i>aliases</i>(5):

             user1                   otheruser
             user2@example.org       otheruser1,otheruser2
             @example.org            otheruser@example.com
             @                       catchall@example.com

       The following directive shares the same table format, but with a
       different meaning.  Here, the user is allowed to send mail from
       the listed addresses:

             <b>listen on </b><i>interface</i> <b>auth </b>[<i>...</i>] <b>senders </b>&lt;<i>table</i>&gt;

   <b>Domain tables</b>
       Domain tables are simple lists of domains or hosts.

             <b>match for domain </b>&lt;table&gt; <b>action </b><i>name</i>
             <b>match helo </b>&lt;table&gt; [<i>...</i>] <b>action </b><i>name</i>

       In that context, the list of domains will be matched against the
       recipient domain or against the HELO name advertised by the
       sending host, respectively.  For ‘static’, ‘file’ and <i>dbopen</i>(3)
       backends, a wildcard may be used so the domain table may contain:

             example.org
             *.example.org

   <b>Credentials tables</b>
       Credentials tables are mappings of credentials.  They can be used
       in two contexts:

             <b>listen on </b><i>interface</i> <b>tls </b>[<i>...</i>] <b>auth </b>&lt;<i>table</i>&gt;
             <b>action </b><i>name</i> <b>relay host </b><i>relay-url</i> <b>auth </b>&lt;<i>table</i>&gt;

       In a listener context, the credentials are a mapping of username
       and encrypted passwords:

             user1   $2b$10$hIJ4QfMcp.90nJwKqGbKM.MybArjHOTpEtoTV.DgLYAiThuoYmTSe
             user2   $2b$10$bwSmUOBGcZGamIfRuXGTvuTo3VLbPG9k5yeKNMBtULBhksV5KdGsK

       The passwords are to be encrypted using the <i>smtpctl</i>(8) encrypt
       subcommand.

       In a relay context, the credentials are a mapping of labels and
       username:password pairs:

             label1  user:password

       The label must be unique and is used as a selector for the proper
       credentials when multiple credentials are valid for a single
       destination.  The password is not encrypted as it must be
       provided to the remote host.

   <b>Netaddr tables</b>
       Netaddr tables are lists of IPv4 and IPv6 network addresses.
       They can only be used in the following context:

             <b>match from src </b>&lt;<i>table</i>&gt; <b>action </b><i>name</i>

       When used as a "from source", the address of a client is compared
       to the list of addresses in the table until a match is found.

       A netaddr table can contain exact addresses or netmasks, and
       looks as follow:

             192.168.1.1
             [::1]
             192.168.1.0/24

       IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets.

   <b>Userinfo tables</b>
       Userinfo tables are used in rule context to specify an alternate
       userbase, mapping virtual users to local system users by UID, GID
       and home directory.

             <b>action </b><i>name method</i> <b>userbase </b>&lt;<i>table</i>&gt;

       A userinfo table looks as follows:

             joe     1000:100:/home/virtual/joe
             jack    1000:100:/home/virtual/jack

       In this example, both joe and jack are virtual users mapped to
       the local system user with UID 1000 and GID 100, but different
       home directories.  These directories may contain a <i>forward</i>(5)
       file.  This can be used in conjunction with an alias table that
       maps an email address or the domain part to the desired virtual
       username.  For example:

             joe@example.org     joe
             jack@example.com    jack

   <b>Source tables</b>
       Source tables are lists of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  They can
       only be used in the following context:

             <b>action </b><i>name</i> <b>relay src </b>&lt;<i>table</i>&gt;

       Successive queries to the source table will return the elements
       one by one.

       A source table looks as follow:

             192.168.1.2
             192.168.1.3
             [::1]
             [::2]

       IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets.

   <b>Mailaddr tables</b>
       Mailaddr tables are lists of email addresses.  They can be used
       in the following contexts:

             <b>match mail-from </b>&lt;<i>table</i>&gt; <b>action </b><i>name</i>
             <b>match rcpt-to </b>&lt;<i>table</i>&gt; <b>action </b><i>name</i>

       A mailaddr entry is used to match an email address against a
       username, a domain or a full email address.  A "*" wildcard may
       be used in part of the domain name.

       A mailaddr table looks as follow:

             user
             @domain
             user@domain
             user@*.domain

   <b>Addrname tables</b>
       Addrname tables are used to map IP addresses to hostnames.  They
       can be used in both listen context and relay context:

             <b>listen on </b><i>interface</i> <b>hostnames </b>&lt;<i>table</i>&gt;
             <b>action </b><i>name</i> <b>relay helo-src </b>&lt;<i>table</i>&gt;

       In listen context, the table is used to look up the server name
       to advertise depending on the local address of the socket on
       which a connection is accepted.  In relay context, the table is
       used to determine the hostname for the HELO sequence of the SMTP
       protocol, depending on the local address used for the outgoing
       connection.

       The format is a mapping from inet4 or inet6 addresses to
       hostnames:

             [::1]           localhost
             127.0.0.1       localhost
             88.190.23.165   www.opensmtpd.org

       IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets.
