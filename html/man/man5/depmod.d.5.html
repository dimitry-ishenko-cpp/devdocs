NAME </h2>
<pre>
       depmod.d - Configuration directory for depmod
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       /lib/depmod.d/*.conf

       /usr/lib/depmod.d/*.conf

       /usr/local/lib/depmod.d/*.conf

       /etc/depmod.d/*.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The order in which modules are processed by the <b>depmod </b>command
       can be altered on a global or per-module basis. This is typically
       useful in cases where built-in kernel modules are complemented by
       custom built versions of the same and the user wishes to affect
       the priority of processing in order to override the module
       version supplied by the kernel.

       The format of files under depmod.d is simple: one command per
       line, with blank lines and lines starting with '#' ignored
       (useful for adding comments). A '\' at the end of a line causes
       it to continue on the next line, which makes the files a bit
       neater.

COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       search <i>subdirectory...</i>
           This allows you to specify the order in which /lib/modules
           (or other configured module location) subdirectories will be
           processed by <b>depmod</b>. Directories are listed in order, with
           the highest priority given to the first listed directory and
           the lowest priority given to the last directory listed. The
           special keyword <b>built-in </b>refers to the standard module
           directories installed by the kernel. Another special keyword
           <b>external </b>refers to the list of external directories, defined
           by the <b>external </b>command.

           By default, depmod will give a higher priority to a directory
           with the name <b>updates </b>using this built-in search string:
           "updates built-in" but more complex arrangements are possible
           and are used in several popular distributions.

       override <i>modulename kernelversion modulesubdirectory</i>
           This command allows you to override which version of a
           specific module will be used when more than one module
           sharing the same name is processed by the <b>depmod </b>command. It
           is possible to specify one kernel or all kernels using the *
           wildcard.  <i>modulesubdirectory</i> is the name of the subdirectory
           under /lib/modules (or other module location) where the
           target module is installed.

           For example, it is possible to override the priority of an
           updated test module called <b>kmod </b>by specifying the following
           command: "override kmod * extra". This will ensure that any
           matching module name installed under the <b>extra </b>subdirectory
           within /lib/modules (or other module location) will take
           priority over any likenamed module already provided by the
           kernel.

       external <i>kernelversion absolutemodulesdirectory...</i>
           This specifies a list of directories, which will be checked
           according to the priorities in the <b>search </b>command. The order
           matters also, the first directory has the higher priority.

           The <i>kernelversion</i> is a POSIX regular expression or *
           wildcard, like in the <b>override</b>.

       exclude <i>excludedir</i>
           This specifies the trailing directories that will be excluded
           during the search for kernel modules.

           The <i>excludedir</i> is the trailing directory to exclude
