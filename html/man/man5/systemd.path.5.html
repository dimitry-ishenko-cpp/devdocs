NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd.path - Path unit configuration
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>path</i>.path
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".path" encodes
       information about a path monitored by systemd, for path-based
       activation.

       This man page lists the configuration options specific to this
       unit type. See <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for the common options of all unit
       configuration files. The common configuration items are
       configured in the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The path
       specific configuration options are configured in the [Path]
       section.

       For each path file, a matching unit file must exist, describing
       the unit to activate when the path changes. By default, a service
       by the same name as the path (except for the suffix) is
       activated. Example: a path file foo.path activates a matching
       service foo.service. The unit to activate may be controlled by
       <i>Unit=</i> (see below).

       Internally, path units use the <a href="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify(7)</a> API to monitor file
       systems. Due to that, it suffers by the same limitations as
       inotify, and for example cannot be used to monitor files or
       directories changed by other machines on remote NFS file systems.

       When a service unit triggered by a path unit terminates
       (regardless whether it exited successfully or failed), monitored
       paths are checked immediately again, and the service accordingly
       restarted instantly. As protection against busy looping in this
       trigger/start cycle, a start rate limit is enforced on the
       service unit, see <i>StartLimitIntervalSec=</i> and <i>StartLimitBurst=</i> in
       <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>. Unlike other service failures, the error
       condition that the start rate limit is hit is propagated from the
       service unit to the path unit and causes the path unit to fail as
       well, thus ending the loop.
</pre> <h2>
AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Implicit Dependencies</b>
       The following dependencies are implicitly added:

       •   If a path unit is beneath another mount unit in the file
           system hierarchy, both a requirement and an ordering
           dependency between both units are created automatically.

       •   An implicit <i>Before=</i> dependency is added between a path unit
           and the unit it is supposed to activate.

   <b>Default Dependencies</b>
       The following dependencies are added unless
       <i>DefaultDependencies=no</i> is set:

       •   Path units will automatically have dependencies of type
           <i>Before=</i> on paths.target, dependencies of type <i>After=</i> and
           <i>Requires=</i> on sysinit.target, and have dependencies of type
           <i>Conflicts=</i> and <i>Before=</i> on shutdown.target. These ensure that
           path units are terminated cleanly prior to system shutdown.
           Only path units involved with early boot or late system
           shutdown should disable <i>DefaultDependencies=</i> option.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Path unit files may include [Unit] and [Install] sections, which
       are described in <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>.

       Path unit files must include a [Path] section, which carries
       information about the path or paths it monitors. The options
       specific to the [Path] section of path units are the following:

       <i>PathExists=</i>, <i>PathExistsGlob=</i>, <i>PathChanged=</i>, <i>PathModified=</i>,
       <i>DirectoryNotEmpty=</i>
           Defines paths to monitor for certain changes: <i>PathExists=</i> may
           be used to watch the mere existence of a file or directory.
           If the file specified exists, the configured unit is
           activated.  <i>PathExistsGlob=</i> works similarly, but checks for
           the existence of at least one file matching the globbing
           pattern specified.  <i>PathChanged=</i> may be used to watch a file
           or directory and activate the configured unit whenever it
           changes. It is not activated on every write to the watched
           file but it is activated if the file which was open for
           writing gets closed.  <i>PathModified=</i> is similar, but
           additionally it is activated also on simple writes to the
           watched file.  <i>DirectoryNotEmpty=</i> may be used to watch a
           directory and activate the configured unit whenever it
           contains at least one file.

           The arguments of these directives must be absolute file
           system paths.

           Multiple directives may be combined, of the same and of
           different types, to watch multiple paths. If the empty string
           is assigned to any of these options, the list of paths to
           watch is reset, and any prior assignments of these options
           will not have any effect.

           If a path already exists (in case of <i>PathExists=</i> and
           <i>PathExistsGlob=</i>) or a directory already is not empty (in case
           of <i>DirectoryNotEmpty=</i>) at the time the path unit is
           activated, then the configured unit is immediately activated
           as well. Something similar does not apply to <i>PathChanged=</i> and
           <i>PathModified=</i>.

           If the path itself or any of the containing directories are
           not accessible, <b>systemd </b>will watch for permission changes and
           notice that conditions are satisfied when permissions allow
           that.

       <i>Unit=</i>
           The unit to activate when any of the configured paths
           changes. The argument is a unit name, whose suffix is not
           ".path". If not specified, this value defaults to a service
           that has the same name as the path unit, except for the
           suffix. (See above.) It is recommended that the unit name
           that is activated and the unit name of the path unit are
           named identical, except for the suffix.

       <i>MakeDirectory=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, the directories to watch
           are created before watching. This option is ignored for
           <i>PathExists=</i> settings. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       <i>DirectoryMode=</i>
           If <i>MakeDirectory=</i> is enabled, use the mode specified here to
           create the directories in question. Takes an access mode in
           octal notation. Defaults to <b>0755</b>.

       <i>TriggerLimitIntervalSec=</i>, <i>TriggerLimitBurst=</i>
           Configures a limit on how often this path unit may be
           activated within a specific time interval. The
           <i>TriggerLimitIntervalSec=</i> may be used to configure the length
           of the time interval in the usual time units "us", "ms", "s",
           "min", "h", ... and defaults to 2s. See <a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)</a> for
           details on the various time units understood. The
           <i>TriggerLimitBurst=</i> setting takes a positive integer value and
           specifies the number of permitted activations per time
           interval, and defaults to 200. Set either to 0 to disable any
           form of trigger rate limiting. If the limit is hit, the unit
           is placed into a failure mode, and will not watch the paths
           anymore until restarted. Note that this limit is enforced
           before the service activation is enqueued.

           Added in version 250.
