NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cupsd.conf - server configuration file for cups
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cupsd.conf</i> file configures the CUPS scheduler, <a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd(8)</a>.  It
       is normally located in the <i>/etc/cups</i> directory.  Each line in the
       file can be a configuration directive, a blank line, or a
       comment.  Configuration directives typically consist of a name
       and zero or more values separated by whitespace.  The
       configuration directive name and values are case-insensitive.
       Comment lines start with the # character.

   <b>TOP-LEVEL DIRECTIVES</b>
       The following top-level directives are understood by <a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd(8)</a>:

       <b>AccessLogLevel config</b>

       <b>AccessLogLevel actions</b>

       <b>AccessLogLevel all</b>
            Specifies the logging level for the AccessLog file.  The
            "config" level logs when printers and classes are added,
            deleted, or modified and when configuration files are
            accessed or updated.  The "actions" level logs when print
            jobs are submitted, held, released, modified, or canceled,
            and any of the conditions for "config".  The "all" level
            logs all requests.  The default access log level is
            "actions".

       <b>AutoPurgeJobs Yes</b>

       <b>AutoPurgeJobs No</b>
            Specifies whether to purge job history data automatically
            when it is no longer required for quotas.  The default is
            "No".

       <b>BrowseDNSSDSubTypes</b><i>_subtype[,...]</i>
            Specifies a list of Bonjour sub-types to advertise for each
            shared printer.  For example, "BrowseDNSSDSubTypes
            _cups,_print" will tell network clients that both CUPS
            sharing and IPP Everywhere are supported.  The default is
            "_cups" which is necessary for printer sharing to work
            between systems using CUPS.

       <b>BrowseLocalProtocols all</b>

       <b>BrowseLocalProtocols dnssd</b>

       <b>BrowseLocalProtocols none</b>
            Specifies which protocols to use for local printer sharing.
            The default is "dnssd" on systems that support Bonjour and
            "none" otherwise.

       <b>BrowseWebIF Yes</b>

       <b>BrowseWebIF No</b>
            Specifies whether the CUPS web interface is advertised.  The
            default is "No".

       <b>Browsing Yes</b>

       <b>Browsing No</b>
            Specifies whether shared printers are advertised.  The
            default is "No".

       <b>DefaultAuthType Basic</b>

       <b>DefaultAuthType Negotiate</b>
            Specifies the default type of authentication to use.  The
            default is "Basic".

       <b>DefaultEncryption Never</b>

       <b>DefaultEncryption IfRequested</b>

       <b>DefaultEncryption Required</b>
            Specifies whether encryption will be used for authenticated
            requests.  The default is "Required".

       <b>DefaultLanguage </b><i>locale</i>
            Specifies the default language to use for text and web
            content.  The default is "en".

       <b>DefaultPaperSize Auto</b>

       <b>DefaultPaperSize None</b>

       <b>DefaultPaperSize </b><i>sizename</i>
            Specifies the default paper size for new print queues.
            "Auto" uses a locale-specific default, while "None"
            specifies there is no default paper size.  Specific size
            names are typically "Letter" or "A4".  The default is
            "Auto".

       <b>DefaultPolicy </b><i>policy-name</i>
            Specifies the default access policy to use.  The default
            access policy is "default".

       <b>DefaultShared Yes</b>

       <b>DefaultShared No</b>
            Specifies whether local printers are shared by default.  The
            default is "Yes".

       <b>DirtyCleanInterval </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies the delay for updating of configuration and state
            files.  A value of 0 causes the update to happen as soon as
            possible, typically within a few milliseconds.  The default
            value is "30".

       <b>DNSSDHostName</b><i>hostname.example.com</i>
            Specifies the fully-qualified domain name for the server
            that is used for Bonjour sharing.  The default is typically
            the server's ".local" hostname.

       <b>ErrorPolicy abort-job</b>
            Specifies that a failed print job should be aborted
            (discarded) unless otherwise specified for the printer.

       <b>ErrorPolicy retry-current-job</b>
            Specifies that a failed print job should be retried
            immediately unless otherwise specified for the printer.

       <b>ErrorPolicy retry-job</b>
            Specifies that a failed print job should be retried at a
            later time unless otherwise specified for the printer.

       <b>ErrorPolicy stop-printer</b>
            Specifies that a failed print job should stop the printer
            unless otherwise specified for the printer. The 'stop-
            printer' error policy is the default.

       <b>FilterLimit </b><i>limit</i>
            Specifies the maximum cost of filters that are run
            concurrently, which can be used to minimize disk, memory,
            and CPU resource problems.  A limit of 0 disables filter
            limiting.  An average print to a non-PostScript printer
            needs a filter limit of about 200.  A PostScript printer
            needs about half that (100).  Setting the limit below these
            thresholds will effectively limit the scheduler to printing
            a single job at any time.  The default limit is "0".

       <b>FilterNice </b><i>nice-value</i>
            Specifies the scheduling priority ( <b>nice</b>(8) value) of
            filters that are run to print a job.  The nice value ranges
            from 0, the highest priority, to 19, the lowest priority.
            The default is 0.

       <b>GSSServiceName </b><i>name</i>
            Specifies the service name when using Kerberos
            authentication.  The default service name is "http."

       <b>HostNameLookups On</b>

       <b>HostNameLookups Off</b>

       <b>HostNameLookups Double</b>
            Specifies whether to do reverse lookups on connecting
            clients.  The "Double" setting causes <a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd(8)</a> to verify
            that the hostname resolved from the address matches one of
            the addresses returned for that hostname.  Double lookups
            also prevent clients with unregistered addresses from
            connecting to your server.  The default is "Off" to avoid
            the potential server performance problems with hostname
            lookups.  Only set this option to "On" or "Double" if
            absolutely required.

       <b>IdleExitTimeout </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies the length of time to wait before shutting down
            due to inactivity.  The default is "60" seconds.  Note: Only
            applicable when <a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd(8)</a> is run on-demand (e.g., with <b>-l</b>).

       <b>JobKillDelay </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies the number of seconds to wait before killing the
            filters and backend associated with a canceled or held job.
            The default is "30".

       <b>JobRetryInterval </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies the interval between retries of jobs in seconds.
            This is typically used for fax queues but can also be used
            with normal print queues whose error policy is "retry-job"
            or "retry-current-job".  The default is "30".

       <b>JobRetryLimit </b><i>count</i>
            Specifies the number of retries that are done for jobs.
            This is typically used for fax queues but can also be used
            with normal print queues whose error policy is "retry-job"
            or "retry-current-job".  The default is "5".

       <b>KeepAlive Yes</b>

       <b>KeepAlive No</b>
            Specifies whether to support HTTP keep-alive connections.
            The default is "Yes".

       <b>&lt;Limit </b><i>operation</i> ...<b>&gt; </b>... <b>&lt;/Limit&gt;</b>
            Specifies the IPP operations that are being limited inside a
            Policy section. IPP operation names are listed below in the
            section "IPP OPERATION NAMES".

       <b>&lt;Limit </b><i>method</i> ...<b>&gt; </b>... <b>&lt;/Limit&gt;</b>

       <b>&lt;LimitExcept </b><i>method</i> ...<b>&gt; </b>... <b>&lt;/LimitExcept&gt;</b>
            Specifies the HTTP methods that are being limited inside a
            Location section. HTTP method names are listed below in the
            section "HTTP METHOD NAMES".

       <b>LimitRequestBody </b><i>size</i>
            Specifies the maximum size of print files, IPP requests, and
            HTML form data.  The default is "0" which disables the limit
            check.

       <b>Listen </b><i>ipv4-address</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>

       <b>Listen [</b><i>ipv6-address</i><b>]:</b><i>port</i>

       <b>Listen *:</b><i>port</i>

       <b>Listen </b><i>/path/to/domain/socket</i>
            Listens to the specified address and port or domain socket
            path for connections.  Multiple Listen directives can be
            provided to listen on multiple addresses.  The Listen
            directive is similar to the Port directive but allows you to
            restrict access to specific interfaces or networks.

       <b>&lt;Location </b><i>/path</i><b>&gt; </b>... <b>&lt;/Location&gt;</b>
            Specifies access control for the named location.  Paths are
            documented below in the section "LOCATION PATHS".

       <b>LogDebugHistory </b><i>number</i>
            Specifies the number of debugging messages that are retained
            for logging if an error occurs in a print job. Debug
            messages are logged regardless of the LogLevel setting.

       <b>LogLevel </b>none

       <b>LogLevel </b>emerg

       <b>LogLevel </b>alert

       <b>LogLevel </b>crit

       <b>LogLevel </b>error

       <b>LogLevel </b>warn

       <b>LogLevel </b>notice

       <b>LogLevel </b>info

       <b>LogLevel </b>debug

       <b>LogLevel </b>debug2
            Specifies the level of logging for the ErrorLog file.  The
            value "none" stops all logging while "debug2" logs
            everything.  The default is "warn".

       <b>LogTimeFormat </b>standard

       <b>LogTimeFormat </b>usecs
            Specifies the format of the date and time in the log files.
            The value "standard" is the default and logs whole seconds
            while "usecs" logs microseconds.

       <b>MaxClients </b><i>number</i>
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous clients that
            are allowed by the scheduler.  The default is "100".

       <b>MaxClientsPerHost </b><i>number</i>
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous clients that
            are allowed from a single address.  The default is the
            MaxClients value.

       <b>MaxCopies </b><i>number</i>
            Specifies the maximum number of copies that a user can print
            of each job.  The default is "9999".

       <b>MaxHoldTime </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies the maximum time a job may remain in the
            "indefinite" hold state before it is canceled.  The default
            is "0" which disables cancellation of held jobs.

       <b>MaxJobs </b><i>number</i>
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous jobs that are
            allowed.  Set to "0" to allow an unlimited number of jobs.
            The default is "500".

       <b>MaxJobsPerPrinter </b><i>number</i>
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous jobs that are
            allowed per printer.  The default is "0" which allows up to
            MaxJobs jobs per printer.

       <b>MaxJobsPerUser </b><i>number</i>
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous jobs that are
            allowed per user.  The default is "0" which allows up to
            MaxJobs jobs per user.

       <b>MaxJobTime </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies the maximum time a job may take to print before it
            is canceled.  Set to "0" to disable cancellation of "stuck"
            jobs.  The default is "10800" (3 hours).

       <b>MaxLogSize </b><i>size</i>
            Specifies the maximum size of the log files before they are
            rotated.  The value "0" disables log rotation.  The default
            is "1048576" (1MB).

       <b>MultipleOperationTimeout </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies the maximum amount of time to allow between files
            in a multiple file print job.  The default is "900" (15
            minutes).

       <b>&lt;Policy </b><i>name</i><b>&gt; </b>... <b>&lt;/Policy&gt;</b>
            Specifies access control for the named policy.

       <b>Port </b><i>number</i>
            Listens to the specified port number for connections.

       <b>PreserveJobFiles Yes</b>

       <b>PreserveJobFiles No</b>

       <b>PreserveJobFiles </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies whether job files (documents) are preserved after
            a job is printed.  If a numeric value is specified, job
            files are preserved for the indicated number of seconds
            after printing.  The default is "86400" (preserve 1 day).

       <b>PreserveJobHistory Yes</b>

       <b>PreserveJobHistory No</b>

       <b>PreserveJobHistory </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies whether the job history is preserved after a job
            is printed.  If a numeric value is specified, the job
            history is preserved for the indicated number of seconds
            after printing.  If "Yes", the job history is preserved
            until the MaxJobs limit is reached.  The default is "Yes".

       <b>ReloadTimeout </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies the amount of time to wait for job completion
            before restarting the scheduler.  The default is "30".

       <b>ServerAdmin </b><i>email-address</i>
            Specifies the email address of the server administrator.
            The default value is "root@ServerName".

       <b>ServerAlias </b><i>hostname</i> [ ... <i>hostname</i> ]

       <b>ServerAlias *</b>
            The ServerAlias directive is used for HTTP Host header
            validation when clients connect to the scheduler from
            external interfaces.  Using the special name "*" can expose
            your system to known browser-based DNS rebinding attacks,
            even when accessing sites through a firewall.  If the auto-
            discovery of alternate names does not work, we recommend
            listing each alternate name with a ServerAlias directive
            instead of using "*".

       <b>ServerName </b><i>hostname</i>
            Specifies the fully-qualified hostname of the server.  The
            default is the value reported by the <a href="../man1/hostname.1.html">hostname(1)</a> command.

       <b>ServerTokens None</b>

       <b>ServerTokens ProductOnly</b>

       <b>ServerTokens Major</b>

       <b>ServerTokens Minor</b>

       <b>ServerTokens Minimal</b>

       <b>ServerTokens OS</b>

       <b>ServerTokens Full</b>
            Specifies what information is included in the Server header
            of HTTP responses.  "None" disables the Server header.
            "ProductOnly" reports "CUPS".  "Major" reports "CUPS/major
            IPP/2".  "Minor" reports "CUPS/major.minor IPP/2.1".
            "Minimal" reports "CUPS/major.minor.patch IPP/2.1".  "OS"
            reports "CUPS/major.minor.path (osname osversion) IPP/2.1".
            "Full" reports "CUPS/major.minor.path (osname osversion;
            architecture) IPP/2.1".  The default is "Minimal".

       <b>SSLListen </b><i>ipv4-address</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>

       <b>SSLListen [</b><i>ipv6-address</i><b>]:</b><i>port</i>

       <b>SSLListen *:</b><i>port</i>
            Listens on the specified address and port for encrypted
            connections.

       <b>SSLOptions </b>[<i>AllowDH</i>] [<i>AllowRC4</i>] [<i>AllowSSL3</i>] [<i>DenyCBC</i>]
       [<i>DenyTLS1.0</i>] [<i>MaxTLS1.0</i>] [<i>MaxTLS1.1</i>] [<i>MaxTLS1.2</i>] [<i>MaxTLS1.3</i>]
       [<i>MinTLS1.0</i>] [<i>MinTLS1.1</i>] [<i>MinTLS1.2</i>] [<i>MinTLS1.3</i>]

       <b>SSLOptions None</b>
            Sets encryption options (only in /etc/cups/client.conf).  By
            default, CUPS only supports encryption using TLS v1.0 or
            higher using known secure cipher suites.  Security is
            reduced when <i>Allow</i> options are used.  Security is enhanced
            when <i>Deny</i> options are used.  The <i>AllowDH</i> option enables
            cipher suites using plain Diffie-Hellman key negotiation
            (not supported on systems using GNU TLS).  The <i>AllowRC4</i>
            option enables the 128-bit RC4 cipher suites, which are
            required for some older clients.  The <i>AllowSSL3</i> option
            enables SSL v3.0, which is required for some older clients
            that do not support TLS v1.0.  The <i>DenyCBC</i> option disables
            all CBC cipher suites.  The <i>DenyTLS1.0</i> option disables TLS
            v1.0 support - this sets the minimum protocol version to TLS
            v1.1.  The <i>MinTLS</i> options set the minimum TLS version to
            support.  The <i>MaxTLS</i> options set the maximum TLS version to
            support.  Not all operating systems support TLS 1.3 at this
            time.

       <b>SSLPort </b><i>port</i>
            Listens on the specified port for encrypted connections.

       <b>StrictConformance Yes</b>

       <b>StrictConformance No</b>
            Specifies whether the scheduler requires clients to strictly
            adhere to the IPP specifications.  The default is "No".

       <b>Timeout </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies the HTTP request timeout.  The default is "900"
            (15 minutes).

       <b>WebInterface yes</b>

       <b>WebInterface no</b>
            Specifies whether the web interface is enabled.  The default
            is "No".

   <b>HTTP METHOD NAMES</b>
       The following HTTP methods are supported by <a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd(8)</a>:

       GET  Used by a client to download icons and other printer
            resources and to access the CUPS web interface.

       HEAD Used by a client to get the type, size, and modification
            date of resources.

       OPTIONS

   <b>DIRECTIVES VALID WITHIN LOCATION AND LIMIT SECTIONS</b>
       The following directives may be placed inside Location and Limit
       sections in the <b>cupsd.conf </b>file:

       <b>Allow all</b>

       <b>Allow none</b>

       <b>Allow </b><i>host.domain.com</i>

       <b>Allow *.</b><i>domain.com</i>

       <b>Allow </b><i>ipv4-address</i>

       <b>Allow </b><i>ipv4-address</i><b>/</b><i>netmask</i>

       <b>Allow </b><i>ipv4-address</i><b>/</b><i>mm</i>

       <b>Allow [</b><i>ipv6-address</i><b>]</b>

       <b>Allow [</b><i>ipv6-address</i><b>]/</b><i>mm</i>

       <b>Allow @IF(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b>

       <b>Allow @LOCAL</b>
            Allows access from the named hosts, domains, addresses, or
            interfaces.  The @IF(name) form uses the current subnets
            configured for the named interface.  The @LOCAL form uses
            the current subnets configured for all interfaces that are
            not point-to-point, for example Ethernet and Wi-Fi
            interfaces are used but DSL and VPN interfaces are not.  The
            Order directive controls whether Allow lines are evaluated
            before or after Deny lines.

       <b>AuthType None</b>

       <b>AuthType Basic</b>

       <b>AuthType Default</b>

       <b>AuthType Negotiate</b>
            Specifies the type of authentication required.  The value
            "Default" corresponds to the DefaultAuthType value.

       <b>Deny all</b>

       <b>Deny none</b>

       <b>Deny </b><i>host.domain.com</i>

       <b>Deny *.</b><i>domain.com</i>

       <b>Deny </b><i>ipv4-address</i>

       <b>Deny </b><i>ipv4-address</i><b>/</b><i>netmask</i>

       <b>Deny </b><i>ipv4-address</i><b>/</b><i>mm</i>

       <b>Deny [</b><i>ipv6-address</i><b>]</b>

       <b>Deny [</b><i>ipv6-address</i><b>]/</b><i>mm</i>

       <b>Deny @IF(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b>

       <b>Deny @LOCAL</b>
            Denies access from the named hosts, domains, addresses, or
            interfaces.  The @IF(name) form uses the current subnets
            configured for the named interface.  The @LOCAL form uses
            the current subnets configured for all interfaces that are
            not point-to-point, for example Ethernet and Wi-Fi
            interfaces are used but DSL and VPN interfaces are not.  The
            Order directive controls whether Deny lines are evaluated
            before or after Allow lines.

       <b>Encryption IfRequested</b>

       <b>Encryption Never</b>

       <b>Encryption Required</b>
            Specifies the level of encryption that is required for a
            particular location.  The default value is "IfRequested".

       <b>Order allow,deny</b>
            Specifies that access is denied by default. Allow lines are
            then processed followed by Deny lines to determine whether a
            client may access a particular resource.

       <b>Order deny,allow</b>
            Specifies that access is allowed by default. Deny lines are
            then processed followed by Allow lines to determine whether
            a client may access a particular resource.

       <b>Require group </b><i>group-name</i> [ <i>group-name</i> ... ]
            Specifies that an authenticated user must be a member of one
            of the named groups.

       <b>Require user {</b><i>user-name</i>|<b>@</b><i>group-name</i>} ...
            Specifies that an authenticated user must match one of the
            named users or be a member of one of the named groups.  The
            group name "@SYSTEM" corresponds to the list of groups
            defined by the SystemGroup directive in the
            <a href="cups-files.conf.5.html">cups-files.conf(5)</a> file.  The group name "@OWNER"
            corresponds to the owner of the resource, for example the
            person that submitted a print job.  Note: The 'root' user is
            not special and must be granted privileges like any other
            user account.

       <b>Require valid-user</b>
            Specifies that any authenticated user is acceptable.

       <b>Satisfy all</b>
            Specifies that all Allow, AuthType, Deny, Order, and Require
            conditions must be satisfied to allow access.

       <b>Satisfy any</b>
            Specifies that any a client may access a resource if either
            the authentication (AuthType/Require) or address
            (Allow/Deny/Order) conditions are satisfied.  For example,
            this can be used to require authentication only for remote
            accesses.

   <b>DIRECTIVES VALID WITHIN POLICY SECTIONS</b>
       The following directives may be placed inside Policy sections in
       the <b>cupsd.conf </b>file:

       <b>JobPrivateAccess all</b>

       <b>JobPrivateAccess default</b>

       <b>JobPrivateAccess </b>{<i>user</i>|<b>@</b><i>group</i>|<b>@ACL</b>|<b>@OWNER</b>|<b>@SYSTEM</b>} ...
            Specifies an access list for a job's private values.  The
            "default" access list is "@OWNER @SYSTEM".  "@ACL" maps to
            the printer's requesting-user-name-allowed or requesting-
            user-name-denied values.  "@OWNER" maps to the job's owner.
            "@SYSTEM" maps to the groups listed for the SystemGroup
            directive in the <a href="cups-files.conf.5.html">cups-files.conf(5)</a> file.

       <b>JobPrivateValues all</b>

       <b>JobPrivateValues default</b>

       <b>JobPrivateValues none</b>

       <b>JobPrivateValues </b><i>attribute-name</i> [ ... <i>attribute-name</i> ]
            Specifies the list of job values to make private.  The
            "default" values are "job-name", "job-originating-host-
            name", "job-originating-user-name", and "phone".

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateAccess all</b>

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateAccess default</b>

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateAccess </b>{<i>user</i>|<b>@</b><i>group</i>|<b>@ACL</b>|<b>@OWNER</b>|<b>@SYSTEM</b>} ...
            Specifies an access list for a subscription's private
            values.  The "default" access list is "@OWNER @SYSTEM".
            "@ACL" maps to the printer's requesting-user-name-allowed or
            requesting-user-name-denied values.  "@OWNER" maps to the
            job's owner.  "@SYSTEM" maps to the groups listed for the
            SystemGroup directive in the <a href="cups-files.conf.5.html">cups-files.conf(5)</a> file.

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateValues all</b>

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateValues default</b>

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateValues none</b>

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateValues </b><i>attribute-name</i> [ ... <i>attribute-name</i> ]
            Specifies the list of subscription values to make private.
            The "default" values are "notify-events", "notify-pull-
            method", "notify-recipient-uri", "notify-subscriber-user-
            name", and "notify-user-data".

   <b>DEPRECATED DIRECTIVES</b>
       The following directives are deprecated and will be removed in a
       future release of CUPS:

       <b>Classification </b><i>banner</i>
            Specifies the security classification of the server.  Any
            valid banner name can be used, including "classified",
            "confidential", "secret", "topsecret", and "unclassified",
            or the banner can be omitted to disable secure printing
            functions.  The default is no classification banner.

       <b>ClassifyOverride Yes</b>

       <b>ClassifyOverride No</b>
            Specifies whether users may override the classification
            (cover page) of individual print jobs using the "job-sheets"
            option.  The default is "No".

       <b>ListenBackLog </b><i>number</i>
            Specified the number of pending connections that will be
            allowed.  The scheduler now uses the value "128" on all
            platforms.

       <b>PageLogFormat </b><i>format-string</i>
            Specifies the format of PageLog lines.  Sequences beginning
            with percent (%) characters are replaced with the
            corresponding information, while all other characters are
            copied literally.  The following percent sequences are
            recognized:

                "%%" inserts a single percent character.
                "%{name}" inserts the value of the specified IPP attribute.
                "%C" inserts the number of copies for the current page.
                "%P" inserts the current page number.
                "%T" inserts the current date and time in common log format.
                "%j" inserts the job ID.
                "%p" inserts the printer name.
                "%u" inserts the username.

            The default is the empty string, which disables page
            logging.  The string "%p %u %j %T %P %C %{job-billing}
            %{job-originating-host-name} %{job-name} %{media} %{sides}"
            creates a page log with the standard items.  Use "%{job-
            impressions-completed}" to insert the number of pages
            (sides) that were printed, or "%{job-media-sheets-
            completed}" to insert the number of sheets that were
            printed.

       <b>RIPCache </b><i>size</i>
            Specifies the maximum amount of memory to use when
            converting documents into bitmaps for a printer.  The
            default is "128m".
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       File, directory, and user configuration directives that used to
       be allowed in the <b>cupsd.conf </b>file are now stored in the
       <a href="cups-files.conf.5.html">cups-files.conf(5)</a> file instead in order to prevent certain types
       of privilege escalation attacks.

       The scheduler MUST be restarted manually after making changes to
       the <b>cupsd.conf </b>file.  On Linux this is typically done using the
       <b>systemctl</b>(8) command, while on macOS the <b>launchctl</b>(8) command is
       used instead.

       The @LOCAL macro name can be confusing since the system running
       <b>cupsd </b>often belongs to a different set of subnets from its
       clients.
</pre> <h2>
CONFORMING TO </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>cupsd.conf </b>file format is based on the Apache HTTP Server
       configuration file format.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Log everything with a maximum log file size of 32 megabytes:

           AccessLogLevel all
           LogLevel debug2
           MaxLogSize 32m

       Require authentication for accesses from outside the 10. network:

           &lt;Location /&gt;
           Order allow,deny
           Allow from 10./8
           AuthType Basic
           Require valid-user
           Satisfy any
           &lt;/Location&gt;
