NAME </h2>
<pre>
       filesystems - Linux filesystem types: ext, ext2, ext3, ext4,
       hpfs, iso9660, JFS, minix, msdos, ncpfs nfs, ntfs, proc,
       Reiserfs, smb, sysv, umsdos, vfat, XFS, xiafs
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       When, as is customary, the <b>proc </b>filesystem is mounted on <i>/proc</i>,
       you can find in the file <i>/proc/filesystems</i> which filesystems your
       kernel currently supports; see <a href="proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> for more details.  There
       is also a legacy <a href="../man2/sysfs.2.html">sysfs(2)</a> system call (whose availability is
       controlled by the <b>CONFIG_SYSFS_SYSCALL </b>kernel build configuration
       option since Linux 3.15) that enables enumeration of the
       currently available filesystem types regardless of <i>/proc</i>
       availability and/or sanity.

       If you need a currently unsupported filesystem, insert the
       corresponding kernel module or recompile the kernel.

       In order to use a filesystem, you have to <i>mount</i> it; see <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a>
       and <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>.

       The following list provides a short description of the available
       or historically available filesystems in the Linux kernel.  See
       the kernel documentation for a comprehensive description of all
       options and limitations.

       <b>erofs  </b>is the Enhanced Read-Only File System, stable since Linux
              5.4.  See <a href="erofs.5.html">erofs(5)</a>.

       <b>ext    </b>is an elaborate extension of the <b>minix </b>filesystem.  It has
              been completely superseded by the second version of the
              extended filesystem (<b>ext2</b>) and has been removed from the
              kernel (in Linux 2.1.21).

       <b>ext2   </b>is a disk filesystem that was used by Linux for fixed
              disks as well as removable media.  The second extended
              filesystem was designed as an extension of the extended
              filesystem (<b>ext</b>).  See <a href="ext2.5.html">ext2(5)</a>.

       <b>ext3   </b>is a journaling version of the <b>ext2 </b>filesystem.  It is
              easy to switch back and forth between <b>ext2 </b>and <b>ext3</b>.  See
              <a href="ext3.5.html">ext3(5)</a>.

       <b>ext4   </b>is a set of upgrades to <b>ext3 </b>including substantial
              performance and reliability enhancements, plus large
              increases in volume, file, and directory size limits.  See
              <a href="ext4.5.html">ext4(5)</a>.

       <b>hpfs   </b>is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2.  This
              filesystem is read-only under Linux due to the lack of
              available documentation.

       <b>iso9660</b>
              is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO/IEC 9660
              standard.

              <b>High Sierra</b>
                     Linux supports High Sierra, the precursor to the
                     ISO/IEC 9660 standard for CD-ROM filesystems.  It
                     is automatically recognized within the <b>iso9660</b>
                     filesystem support under Linux.

              <b>Rock Ridge</b>
                     Linux also supports the System Use Sharing Protocol
                     records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange
                     Protocol.  They are used to further describe the
                     files in the <b>iso9660 </b>filesystem to a UNIX host, and
                     provide information such as long filenames,
                     UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and devices.  It is
                     automatically recognized within the <b>iso9660</b>
                     filesystem support under Linux.

       <b>JFS    </b>is a journaling filesystem, developed by IBM, that was
              integrated into Linux 2.4.24.

       <b>minix  </b>is the filesystem used in the Minix operating system, the
              first to run under Linux.  It has a number of
              shortcomings, including a 64 MB partition size limit,
              short filenames, and a single timestamp.  It remains
              useful for floppies and RAM disks.

       <b>msdos  </b>is the filesystem used by DOS, Windows, and some OS/2
              computers.  <b>msdos </b>filenames can be no longer than 8
              characters, followed by an optional period and 3 character
              extension.

       <b>ncpfs  </b>is a network filesystem that supports the NCP protocol,
              used by Novell NetWare.  It was removed from the kernel in
              Linux 4.17.

              To use <b>ncpfs</b>, you need special programs, which can be
              found at ⟨ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs⟩.

       <b>nfs    </b>is the network filesystem used to access disks located on
              remote computers.

       <b>ntfs   </b>is the filesystem native to Microsoft Windows NT,
              supporting features like ACLs, journaling, encryption, and
              so on.

       <b>proc   </b>is a pseudo filesystem which is used as an interface to
              kernel data structures rather than reading and
              interpreting <i>/dev/kmem</i>.  In particular, its files do not
              take disk space.  See <a href="proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       <b>Reiserfs</b>
              is a journaling filesystem, designed by Hans Reiser, that
              was integrated into Linux 2.4.1.

       <b>smb    </b>is a network filesystem that supports the SMB protocol,
              used by Windows.  See 
              ⟨<a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/smbfs/">https://www.samba.org/samba/smbfs/</a>⟩.

       <b>sysv   </b>is an implementation of the System V/Coherent filesystem
              for Linux.  It implements all of Xenix FS, System V/386
              FS, and Coherent FS.

       <b>umsdos </b>is an extended DOS filesystem used by Linux.  It adds
              capability for long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions,
              and special files (devices, named pipes, etc.) under the
              DOS filesystem, without sacrificing compatibility with
              DOS.

       <b>tmpfs  </b>is a filesystem whose contents reside in virtual memory.
              Since the files on such filesystems typically reside in
              RAM, file access is extremely fast.  See <a href="tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a>.

       <b>vfat   </b>is an extended FAT filesystem used by Microsoft Windows95
              and Windows NT.  <b>vfat </b>adds the capability to use long
              filenames under the MSDOS filesystem.

       <b>XFS    </b>is a journaling filesystem, developed by SGI, that was
              integrated into Linux 2.4.20.

       <b>xiafs  </b>was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe
              filesystem by extending the Minix filesystem code.  It
              provides the basic most requested features without undue
              complexity.  The <b>xiafs </b>filesystem is no longer actively
              developed or maintained.  It was removed from the kernel
              in Linux 2.1.21.
