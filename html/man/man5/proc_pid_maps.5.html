DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/maps</i>
              A file containing the currently mapped memory regions and
              their access permissions.  See <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> for some further
              information about memory mappings.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace
              access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS </b>check; see <a href="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>.

              The format of the file is:

                  <i>address</i>           <i>perms offset</i>  <i>dev</i>   <i>inode</i>       <i>pathname</i>

              The <i>address</i> field is the address space in the process that
              the mapping occupies.  The <i>perms</i> field is a set of
              permissions:

                  r = read
                  w = write
                  x = execute
                  s = shared
                  p = private (copy on write)

              The <i>offset</i> field is the offset into the file/whatever; <i>dev</i>
              is the device (major:minor); <i>inode</i> is the inode on that
              device.  0 indicates that no inode is associated with the
              memory region, as would be the case with BSS
              (uninitialized data).

              The <i>pathname</i> field will usually be the file that is
              backing the mapping.  For ELF files, you can easily
              coordinate with the <i>offset</i> field by looking at the Offset
              field in the ELF program headers (<i>readelf -l</i>).

              There are additional helpful pseudo-paths:

              <i>[stack]</i>
                     The initial process's (also known as the main
                     thread's) stack.

              <i>[stack:</i>tid<i>]</i> (from Linux 3.4 to Linux 4.4)
                     A thread's stack (where the <i>tid</i> is a thread ID).
                     It corresponds to the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task/</i>tid<i>/</i> path.
                     This field was removed in Linux 4.5, since
                     providing this information for a process with large
                     numbers of threads is expensive.

              <i>[vdso]</i> The virtual dynamically linked shared object.  See
                     <a href="../man7/vdso.7.html">vdso(7)</a>.

              <i>[heap]</i> The process's heap.

              <i>[anon:</i>name<i>]</i> (since Linux 5.17)
                     A named private anonymous mapping.  Set with
                     <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_VMA_ANON_NAME</b>.

              <i>[anon_shmem:</i>name<i>]</i> (since Linux 6.2)
                     A named shared anonymous mapping.  Set with
                     <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_VMA_ANON_NAME</b>.

              If the <i>pathname</i> field is blank, this is an anonymous
              mapping as obtained via <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>.  There is no easy way to
              coordinate this back to a process's source, short of
              running it through <a href="../man1/gdb.1.html">gdb(1)</a>, <a href="../man1/strace.1.html">strace(1)</a>, or similar.

              <i>pathname</i> is shown unescaped except for newline characters,
              which are replaced with an octal escape sequence.  As a
              result, it is not possible to determine whether the
              original pathname contained a newline character or the
              literal <i>\012</i> character sequence.

              If the mapping is file-backed and the file has been
              deleted, the string " (deleted)" is appended to the
              pathname.  Note that this is ambiguous too.

              Under Linux 2.0, there is no field giving pathname.
