       ovn-ic-nb - OVN_IC_Northbound database schema

       This database is the interface for cloud management system (CMS),
       such as OpenStack, to configure OVN interconnection settings. The
       CMS produces almost all of the contents of the database. The
       <b>ovn-ic </b>program monitors the database contents, transforms it, and
       stores it into the <b>OVN_IC_Southbound </b>database.

       We generally speak of ``the’’ CMS, but one can imagine scenarios
       in which multiple CMSes manage different parts of OVN
       interconnection.

   <b>External IDs</b>
       Each of the tables in this database contains a special column,
       named <b>external_ids</b>. This column has the same form and purpose
       each place it appears.

              <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for use by the CMS. The CMS might
                     use certain pairs, for example, to identify
                     entities in its own configuration that correspond
                     to those in this database.

       These columns allow a client to track the overall configuration
       state of the system.

       <b>nb_ic_cfg</b>: integer
              Sequence number for client to increment. When a client
              modifies the interconnect northbound database
              configuration and wishes to wait for <b>OVN-ICs </b>to handle
              this change and update the Interconnect southbound
              database, it may increment this sequence number.

       <b>sb_ic_cfg</b>: integer
              Sequence number that one <b>OVN-IC </b>sets to the value of
              <b>nb_ic_cfg </b>after waiting to all the <b>OVN-ICs </b>finish applying

              authenticated by a certificate signed by the CA
              certificate thus obtained. <b>This option exposes the SSL</b>
              <b>connection to a man-in-the-middle attack obtaining the</b>

       <b>target</b>: string (must be unique within table)
              Connection methods for clients.

              The following connection methods are currently supported:

              <b>ssl:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified SSL <i>port</i> on the host at the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address. A valid SSL
                     configuration must be provided when this form is
                     used, this configuration can be specified via
                     command-line options or the <b>SSL </b>table.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not
                     always built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>tcp:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified TCP <i>port</i> on the host at the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address. If <i>host</i> is an
                     IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[::1]:6640</b>.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              <b>pssl:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for SSL connections on the specified TCP
                     <i>port</i>. Specify 0 for <i>port</i> to have the kernel
                     automatically choose an available port. If <i>host</i>,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address, is specified,
                     then connections are restricted to the resolved or
                     specified local IPaddress (either IPv4 or IPv6
                     address). If <i>host</i> is an IPv6 address, wrap in
                     square brackets, e.g. <b>pssl:6640:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is
                     not specified then it listens only on IPv4 (but not
                     IPv6) addresses. A valid SSL configuration must be
                     provided when this form is used, this can be
                     specified either via command-line options or the
                     <b>SSL </b>table.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not
                     always built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>ptcp:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for connections on the specified TCP <i>port</i>.
                     Specify 0 for <i>port</i> to have the kernel automatically
                     choose an available port. If <i>host</i>, which can either
                     be a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or an
                     IP address, is specified, then connections are
                     restricted to the resolved or specified local IP
                     address (either IPv4 or IPv6 address). If <i>host</i> is
                     an IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g.
                     <b>ptcp:6640:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is not specified then it
                     listens only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              When multiple clients are configured, the <b>target </b>values
              must be unique. Duplicate <b>target </b>values yield unspecified
              results.

     <i>Client Failure Detection and Handling:</i>

       <b>max_backoff</b>: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection
              attempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       <b>inactivity_probe</b>: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection
              to the client before sending an inactivity probe message.
              If Open vSwitch does not communicate with the client for
              the specified number of seconds, it will send a probe. If
              a response is not received for the same additional amount
              of time, Open vSwitch assumes the connection has been
              broken and attempts to reconnect. Default is
              implementation-specific. A value of 0 disables inactivity
              probes.

     <i>Status:</i>

       Key-value pair of <b>is_connected </b>is always updated. Other key-value
       pairs in the status columns may be updated depends on the <b>target</b>
       type.

       When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
       inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>punix:</b>), both <b>n_connections</b>
       and <b>is_connected </b>may also be updated while the remaining key-
       value pairs are omitted.

       On the other hand, when <b>target </b>specifies an outbound connection,
       all key-value pairs may be updated, except the above-mentioned
       two key-value pairs associated with inbound connection targets.
       They are omitted.

       <b>is_connected</b>: boolean
              <b>true </b>if currently connected to this client, <b>false</b>
              otherwise.

       <b>status : last_error</b>: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the
              connection to the manager; i.e. <b>strerror(errno)</b>. This key
              will exist only if an error has occurred.

       <b>status : state</b>: optional string, one of <b>ACTIVE</b>, <b>BACKOFF</b>,
       <b>CONNECTING</b>, <b>IDLE</b>, or <b>VOID</b>
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              <b>VOID   </b>Connection is disabled.

              <b>BACKOFF</b>
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              <b>CONNECTING</b>
                     Attempting to connect.

              <b>ACTIVE </b>Connected, remote host responsive.

              <b>IDLE   </b>Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-
                     alive.

              These values may change in the future. They are provided
              only for human consumption.

       <b>status : sec_since_connect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last successfully
              connected to the database (in seconds). Value is empty if
              client has never successfully been connected.

       <b>status : sec_since_disconnect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last disconnected
              from the database (in seconds). Value is empty if client
              has never disconnected.

       <b>status : locks_held</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection holds. Omitted if the connection does not hold
              any locks.

       <b>status : locks_waiting</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection is currently waiting to acquire. Omitted if the
              connection is not waiting for any locks.

       <b>status : locks_lost</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection has had stolen by another OVSDB client. Omitted
              if no locks have been stolen from this connection.

       <b>status : n_connections</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 2
              When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
              inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>) and more than
              one connection is actually active, the value is the number
              of active connections. Otherwise, this key-value pair is
              omitted.

       <b>status : bound_port</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              When <b>target </b>is <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>, this is the TCP port on
              which the OVSDB server is listening. (This is particularly
              useful when <b>target </b>specifies a port of 0, allowing the
