NAME </h2>
<pre>
       auto.master - Master Map for automounter consulted by autofs
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>auto.master </b>map is consulted to set up automount managed
       mount points when the <a href="../man8/autofs.8.html">autofs(8)</a> script is invoked or the
       <a href="../man8/automount.8.html">automount(8)</a> program is run. Each line describes a mount point
       and refers to an autofs map describing file systems to be mounted
       under the mount point.

       The default location of the master map is <b>@mapdir@/auto.master</b>
       but an alternate name may be given on the command line when run‐
       ning the automounter and the default master map may changed by
       setting the <b>MASTER_MAP_NAME </b>configuration variable in
       <b>@confdir@/autofs.  </b>If the master map name has no path then the
       system Name Service Switch configuration will be consulted and
       each of the sources searched in line with the rules given in the
       Name Service Switch configuration.

       Access to mounts in maps is governed by a key.

       For direct maps the mount point is always specified as:

       <b>/-</b>

       and the key used within the direct map is the full path to the
       mount point. The direct map may have multiple entries in the mas‐
       ter map.

       For indirect maps access is by using the path scheme:

       <b>/mount-point/key</b>

       where <i>mount-point</i> is one of the entries listed in the master map.
       The <i>key</i> is a single directory component and is matched against
       entries in the map given in the entry (See <a href="autofs.5.html">autofs(5)</a>).

       Additionally, a map may be included from its source as if it were
       itself present in the master map by including a line of the form:

       <b>+</b>[<b>maptype</b>[,<b>format</b>]:]<b>map </b>[<b>options</b>]

       and <a href="../man8/automount.8.html">automount(8)</a> will process the map according to the specifica‐
       tion described below for map entries. Plus map inclusion is only
       permitted in file map sources.  Indirect map entries must be
       unique in the master map so second and subsequent entries for an
       indirect mount point are ignored by <a href="../man8/automount.8.html">automount(8)</a>.

       <b>NOTE:  </b>autofs currently does not collapse multiple slashes in
              paths, so it is important to ensure paths used in maps are
              correct. If unnecessary multiple slashes are present in a
              path it can lead to unexpected failures such as an inabil‐
              ity to expire automounts. An exception to this is a trail‐
              ing slash at the end of the automount point path in the
              master map which will be removed if present.
</pre> <h2>
FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       Master map entries have three fields separated by an arbitrary
       number of spaces or tabs. Lines beginning with # are comments.
       The first field is the mount point described above and the second
       field is the name of the map to be consulted for the mount point
       followed by the third field which contains options to be applied
       to all entries in the map.

       The format of a master map entry is:

       <b>mount-point </b>[<b>map-type</b>[,<b>format</b>]:]<b>map </b>[<b>options</b>]

       <b>mount-point</b>
              Base location for the <b>autofs </b>filesystem to be mounted.
              For indirect maps this directory will be created (as with
              <b>mkdir -p</b>) and is removed when the <b>autofs </b>filesystem is
              umounted.

       <b>map-type</b>
              Type of map used for this mount point.  The following are
              valid map types:

              <b>file   </b>The map is a regular text file.

              <b>program</b>
                     The map is an executable program, which is passed a
                     key on the command line and returns an entry
                     (everything besides the key) on stdout if success‐
                     ful.  Optinally, the keyword exec may be used as a
                     synonym for program to avoid confusion with amd
                     formated maps mount type program.

              <b>yp     </b>The map is a NIS (YP) database.

              <b>nisplus</b>
                     The map is a NIS+ database.

              <b>hesiod </b>The map is a hesiod database whose <b>filsys </b>entries
                     are used for maps.

              <b>ldap </b>or <b>ldaps</b>
                     The map is stored in an LDAP directory. If <b>ldaps </b>is
                     used the appropriate certificate must be configured
                     in the LDAP client.

              <b>multi  </b>This map type allows the specification of multiple
                     maps separated by "--". These maps are searched in
                     order to resolve key lookups.

              <b>dir    </b>This map type can be used at <b>+ </b>master map including
                     notation. The contents of files under given direc‐
                     tory are included to the master map. The name of
                     file to be included must be ended with ".autofs". A
                     file will be ignored if its name is not ended with
                     the suffix. In addition a dot file, a file which
                     name is started with "." is also ignored.

       <b>format</b>
              Format of the map data; currently the formats recognized
              are <b>sun</b>, which is a subset of the Sun automounter map for‐
              mat, <b>hesiod</b>, for hesiod filesys entries and <b>amd </b>for amd
              formated map entries.  If the format is left unspecified,
              it defaults to <b>sun </b>for all map types except <b>hesiod </b>unless
              it is a top level <b>amd </b>mount that has a configuration entry
              for the mount point path, in which case the format used is
              <b>amd</b>.

       <b>map</b>
              Name of the map to use.  This is an absolute UNIX pathname
              for maps of types <b>file</b>, <b>dir</b>, or <b>program</b>, and the name of a
              database in the case for maps of type <b>yp</b>, <b>nisplus</b>, or <b>hes‐</b>
              <b>iod </b>or the <b>dn </b>of an LDAP entry for maps of type <b>ldap</b>.

       <b>options</b>
              Any remaining command line arguments without leading dash‐
              es (-) are taken as options (<i>-o</i>) to <b>mount</b>.  Arguments with
              leading dashes are considered options for the maps and are
              passed to automount (8).

              The <b>sun </b>format supports the following options:

              <i>-Dvariable=value</i>
                     Replace <i>variable</i> with <i>value</i> in map substitutions.

              <i>-strict</i>
                     Treat errors when mounting file systems as fatal.
                     This is important when multiple file systems should
                     be mounted (`multimounts'). If this option is giv‐
                     en, no file system is mounted at all if at least
                     one file system can't be mounted.

              <i>[no]browse</i>
                     This is an autofs specific option that is a pseudo
                     mount option and so is given without a leading
                     dash. Use of the browse option pre-creates mount
                     point directories for indirect mount maps so the
                     map keys can be seen in a directory listing without
                     being mounted. Use of this option can cause perfor‐
                     mance problem if the indirect map is large so it
                     should be used with caution. The internal program
                     default is to enable browse mode for indirect
                     mounts but the default installed configuration
                     overrides this by setting BROWSE_MODE to "no" be‐
                     cause of the potential performance problem. This
                     option does the same as the deprecated --ghost op‐
                     tion, the browse option is preferred because it is
                     used by other autofs implementations.

              <i>nobind</i> This is an autofs specific option that is a pseudo
                     mount option and so is given without a leading
                     dash. It may be used either in the master map entry
                     (so it effects all the map entries) or with indi‐
                     vidual map entries to prevent bind mounting of lo‐
                     cal NFS filesystems. For direct mount maps the op‐
                     tion is only effective if specified on the first
                     direct map entry and is applied to all direct mount
                     maps in the master map. It is ignored if given on
                     subsequent direct map entries. It may be used on
                     individual map entries of both types. Preventing
                     bind mounts of NFS file systems can no longer be
                     done by using the "port=" option, the nobind option
                     must be used instead.

              <i>symlink</i>
                     This option makes bind mounting use a symlink in‐
                     stead of an actual bind mount. It is an autofs spe‐
                     cific option that is a pseudo mount option and so
                     is given without a leading dash. It may be used
                     with indirect map entries only, either in the mas‐
                     ter map (so it effects all map entries) or with in‐
                     dividual map entries. The option is ignored for di‐
                     rect mounts and non-root offest mount entries.

              <i>strictexpire</i>
                     Use a strict expire policy for this automount. Us‐
                     ing this option means that last use of autofs di‐
                     rectory entries will not be updated during path
                     walks so that mounts in an automount won't be kept
                     mounted by applications scanning the mount tree.
                     Note that this doesn't completely resolve the prob‐
                     lem of expired automounts being immediately re-
                     mounted due to application accesses triggered by
                     the expire itself.

              <i>slave</i>, <i>private</i> or <i>shared</i>
                     This option allows mount propagation of bind mounts
                     to be set to <i>slave</i>, <i>private</i> or <i>shared</i>. This option
                     defaults to <i>slave</i> if no option is given. When using
                     multi-mounts that have bind mounts the bind mount
                     will have the same properties as its parent which
                     is commonly propagation <i>shared</i>. And if the mount
                     target is also propagation <i>shared</i> this can lead to
                     a deadlock when attempting to access the offset
                     mounts. When this happens an unwanted offset mount
                     is propagated back to the target file system re‐
                     sulting in a deadlock since the automount target is
                     itself an (unwanted) automount trigger.  This op‐
                     tion is an autofs pseudo mount option that can be
                     used in the master map only.

              <i>-r, --random-multimount-selection</i>
                     Enables the use of random selection when choosing a
                     host from a list of replicated servers. This option
                     is applied to this mount only, overriding the glob‐
                     al setting that may be specified on the command
                     line.

              <i>-w, --use-weight-only</i>
                     Use only specified weights for server selection
                     where more than one server is specified in the map
                     entry. If no server weights are given then each
                     available server will be tried in the order listed,
                     within proximity.

              <i>-t, --timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</i>
                     Set the expire timeout for map entries. This option
                     can be used to override the global default given
                     either on the command line or in the configuration.

              <i>-n, --negative-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</i>
                     Set the timeout for caching failed key lookups.
                     This option can be used to override the global de‐
                     fault given either on the command line or in the
                     configuration.

              <i>--mode &lt;octal_mode&gt;</i>
                     Set the directory mode for the base location of the
                     <b>autofs </b>mount point.  If this option is given, <b>aut‐</b>
                     <b>ofs </b>will chmod that directory with this mode.
</pre> <h2>
BUILTIN MAP -hosts </h2>
<pre>
       If "-hosts" is given as the map then accessing a key under the
       mount point which corresponds to a hostname will allow access to
       the exports of that host. The hosts map cannot be dynamically up‐
       dated and requires a HUP signal to be sent to the daemon for it
       to check hosts for an update. Due to possible hierarchic depen‐
       dencies within a mount tree, it might not be completely updated
       during the HUP signal processing.

       For example, with an entry in the master map of <b>/net -hosts </b>ac‐
       cessing /net/myserver will mount exports from myserver on direc‐
       tories below /net/myserver.

       NOTE: mounts done from a hosts map will be mounted with the "no‐
       suid,nodev" options unless overridden by explicitly specifying
       the "suid", "dev" options in the master map entry.
</pre> <h2>
BUILTIN MAP -null </h2>
<pre>
       If "-null" is given as the map it is used to tell automount(8) to
       ignore a subsequent master map entry with the given path.

       It can be used for paths that appear in the master map or in di‐
       rect mount maps (but not in direct mount maps themselves) or as a
       key in an indirect mount map.

       An indirect mount map key can be nulled. If so the map key is ig‐
       nored and does not result in a mount attempt (essentially the key
       lookup is abandoned early on).

       An indirect mount map top level mount point path can be nulled.
       If so no mounts from the nulled mount are performed (essentially
       it isn't mounted).

       Direct mount map path entries can be nulled. Since they must be
       present at startup they are (notionally) part of the master map
       so direct mount paths that use the -null map may be used in the
       master map to ignore subsequent direct mount map entries.

       A nulled master map entry path will ignore a single subsequent
       matching entry. Any matching entry following that will be treated
       as it normally would be. An example use of this is allowing local
       master map entries to override remote ones.

       NOTE: If a duplicate master map entry path is seen (excluding
       paths of null entries) it will be ignored and noted in the log,
       that is the first encountered master map entry is used unless
       there is a corresponding null entry.
</pre> <h2>
LDAP MAPS </h2>
<pre>
       If the map type <b>ldap </b>is specified the mapname is of the form
       <b>[//servername/]dn</b>, where the optional <b>servername </b>is the name of
       the LDAP server to query, and <b>dn </b>is the Distinguished Name of a
       subtree to search for map entries.  The old style
       <b>ldap:servername:mapname </b>is also understood. Alternatively, the
       type can be obtained from the Name Service Switch configuration,
       in which case the map name alone must be given.

       If no schema is set in the autofs configuration then autofs will
       check each of the commonly used schema for a valid entry and if
       one is found it will be used for subsequent lookups.

       There are three common schemas in use:

       <i>nisMap</i>
              Entries in the <b>nisMap </b>schema are <b>nisObject </b>objects in the
              specified subtree, where the <b>cn </b>attribute is the key (the
              wildcard key is "/"), and the <b>nisMapEntry </b>attribute con‐
              tains the information used by the automounter.

       <i>automountMap</i>
              The <b>automountMap </b>schema has two variations that differ in
              the attribute used for the map key. Entries in the auto‐
              mountMap schema are <b>automount </b>objects in the specified
              subtree, where the <b>cn </b>or <b>automountKey </b>attribute (depending
              on local usage) is the key (the wildcard key is "/"), and
              the <b>automountInformation </b>attribute contains the informa‐
              tion used by the automounter. Note that the <b>cn </b>attribute
              is case insensitive.

       The object classes and attributes used for accessing automount
       maps in LDAP can be changed by setting entries in the autofs con‐
       figuration located in <b>@confdir@/autofs.conf</b>.

       <b>NOTE:  </b>If a schema is given in the configuration then all the
              schema configuration values must be set, any partial
              schema specification will be ignored.

       For <b>amd </b>format maps a different schema is used:

       <i>amdMap</i>
              The <b>amdmap </b>schema contains attributes <b>amdmapName</b>, <b>amdmap‐</b>
              <b>Key </b>and <b>amdmapValue </b>where <b>amdmapName </b>contains the name of
              the containing map, <b>amdmapKey </b>contains the map key and
              <b>amdmapValue </b>contains the map entry.
</pre> <h2>
LDAP AUTHENTICATION, ENCRYPTED AND CERTIFIED CONNECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       LDAP authenticated binds, TLS encrypted connections and certifi‐
       cation may be used by setting appropriate values in the autofs
       authentication configuration file and configuring the LDAP client
       with appropriate settings.  The default location of this file is
       <b>@mapdir@/autofs_ldap_auth.conf</b>.

       If this file exists it will be used to establish whether TLS or
       authentication should be used.

       An example of this file is:

         &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
         &lt;autofs_ldap_sasl_conf
                 usetls="yes"
                 tlsrequired="no"
                 authrequired="no"
                 authtype="DIGEST-MD5"
                 user="xyz"
                 secret="abc"
         /&gt;

       If TLS encryption is to be used the location of the Certificate
       Authority certificate must be set within the LDAP client configu‐
       ration in order to validate the server certificate. If, in addi‐
       tion, a certified connection is to be used then the client cer‐
       tificate and private key file locations must also be configured
       within the LDAP client.

       In OpenLDAP these may be configured in the <b>ldap.conf </b>file or in
       the per-user configuration. For example, it may be sensible to
       use the system wide configuration for the location of the Cer‐
       tificate Authority certificate and set the location of the client
       certificate and private key in the per-user configuration. The
       location of these files and the configuration entry requirements
       is system dependent so the documentation for your installation
       will need to be consulted to get further information.

EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
         /-        auto.data
         /home     /etc/auto.home
         /mnt      yp:mnt.map

       This will generate two mountpoints for <i>/home</i> and <i>/mnt</i> and install
       direct mount triggers for each entry in the direct mount map <i>au‐</i>
       <i>to.data</i>.  All accesses to <i>/home</i> will lead to the consultation of
       the map in <i>/etc/auto.home</i> and all accesses to <i>/mnt</i> will consult
       the NIS map <i>mnt.map</i>.  All accesses to paths in the map <i>auto.data</i>
       will trigger mounts when they are accessed and the Name Service
       Switch configuration will be used to locate the source of the map
       <i>auto.data</i>.

       To avoid making edits to @mapdir@/auto.master, @mapdir@/auto.mas‐
       ter.d may be used.  Files in that directory must have a ".autofs"
       suffix, e.g.  <i>@mapdir@/auto.master.d/extra.autofs.</i>  Such files
       contain lines of the same format as the auto.master file, e.g.

         /foo    /etc/auto.foo
         /baz    yp:baz.map
