       ovn-nb - OVN_Northbound database schema

       This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud
       management system (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it. The
       CMS produces almost all of the contents of the database. The
       <b>ovn-northd </b>program monitors the database contents, transforms it,
       and stores it into the <b>OVN_Southbound </b>database.

       We generally speak of ``the’’ CMS, but one can imagine scenarios
       in which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN
       deployment.

   <b>External IDs</b>
       Each of the tables in this database contains a special column,
       named <b>external_ids</b>. This column has the same form and purpose
       each place it appears.

              <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for use by the CMS. The CMS might
                     use certain pairs, for example, to identify
                     entities in its own configuration that correspond
                     to those in this database.

   <b>Details:</b>
     <i>Identity:</i>

       <b>name</b>: string
              The name of the OVN cluster, which uniquely identifies the
              OVN cluster throughout all OVN clusters supposed to
              interconnect with each other.

     <i>Status:</i>

       These columns allow a client to track the overall configuration
       state of the system.

       <b>nb_cfg</b>: integer
              Sequence number for client to increment. When a client
              modifies any part of the northbound database configuration
              and wishes to wait for <b>ovn-northd </b>and possibly all of the
              hypervisors to finish applying the changes, it may
              increment this sequence number.

       <b>nb_cfg_timestamp</b>: integer
              The timestamp, in milliseconds since the epoch, when
              <b>ovn-northd </b>sees the latest <b>nb_cfg </b>and starts processing.

              To print the timestamp as a human-readable date:

                        <b>date -d "@$(ovn-nbctl get NB_Global . nb_cfg_timestamp | sed ’s/...$//’)"</b>

       <b>sb_cfg</b>: integer
              Sequence number that <b>ovn-northd </b>sets to the value of
              <b>nb_cfg </b>after it finishes applying the corresponding
              configuration changes to the <b>OVN_Southbound </b>database.

       <b>sb_cfg_timestamp</b>: integer
              The timestamp, in milliseconds since the epoch, when
              <b>ovn-northd </b>finishes applying the corresponding
              configuration changes to the <b>OVN_Southbound </b>database
              successfully.

       <b>hv_cfg</b>: integer
              Sequence number that <b>ovn-northd </b>sets to the smallest
              sequence number of all the chassis in the system, as
              reported in the <b>Chassis_Private </b>table in the southbound
              database. Thus, <b>hv_cfg </b>equals <b>nb_cfg </b>if all chassis are
              caught up with the northbound configuration (which may
              never happen, if any chassis is down). This value can
              regress, if a chassis was removed from the system and
              rejoins before catching up.

              If there are no chassis, then <b>ovn-northd </b>copies <b>nb_cfg </b>to
              <b>hv_cfg</b>. Thus, in this case, the (nonexistent) hypervisors
              are always considered to be caught up. This means that
              hypervisors can be "caught up" even in cases where <b>sb_cfg</b>
              would show that the southbound database is not. To detect
              when both the hypervisors and the southbound database are
              caught up, a client should take the smaller of <b>sb_cfg </b>and
              <b>hv_cfg</b>.

       <b>hv_cfg_timestamp</b>: integer
              The largest timestamp, in milliseconds since the epoch, of
              the smallest sequence number of all the chassis in the
              system, as reported in the <b>Chassis_Private </b>table in the
              southbound database. In other words, this timestamp
              reflects the time when the slowest chassis catches up with
              the northbound configuration, which is useful for end-to-
              end control plane latency measurement.

     <i>Common Columns:</i>

       <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs
              See <b>External IDs </b>at the beginning of this document.

     <i>Common options:</i>

       <b>options</b>: map of string-string pairs
              This column provides general key/value settings. The
              supported options are described individually below.

     <i>Options for configuring OVS BFD:</i>

       These options apply when <b>ovn-controller </b>configures OVS BFD on
       tunnels interfaces. Please note these parameters refer to legacy
       OVS BFD implementation and not to OVN BFD one.

       <b>options : bfd-min-rx</b>: optional string
              BFD option <b>min-rx </b>value to use when configuring BFD on
              tunnel interfaces.

       <b>options : bfd-decay-min-rx</b>: optional string
              BFD option <b>decay-min-rx </b>value to use when configuring BFD
              on tunnel interfaces.

       <b>options : bfd-min-tx</b>: optional string
              BFD option <b>min-tx </b>value to use when configuring BFD on
              tunnel interfaces.

       <b>options : bfd-mult</b>: optional string
              BFD option <b>mult </b>value to use when configuring BFD on
              tunnel interfaces.

       <b>options : ignore_chassis_features</b>: optional string
              When set to <b>false</b>, the <b>ovn-northd </b>will evaluate the
              features supported by each chassis and will only activate
              features that are universally supported by all chassis.
              This approach is crucial for maintaining backward
              compatibility during an upgrade when the <b>ovn-northd </b>is
              updated prior to the <b>ovn-controller</b>. However, if any
              chassis is poorly managed and the upgrade is unsuccessful,
              it will restrict <b>ovn-northd </b>from activating the new
              features.

              Alternatively, setting this option to <b>true </b>instructs
              <b>ovn-northd </b>to bypass the support status of features on
              each chassis and to directly implement the latest
              features. This approach safeguards the operation of
              <b>ovn-northd </b>from being adversely affected by a mismatched
              configuration of a chassis.

              The default setting for this option is <b>false</b>.

       <b>options : mac_prefix</b>: optional string
              Configure a given OUI to be used as prefix when L2 address
              is dynamically assigned, e.g. <b>00:11:22</b>

       <b>options : mac_binding_removal_limit</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              MAC binding aging bulk removal limit. This limits how many
              rows can expire in a single transaction. Default value is
              0 which is unlimited. When we hit the limit next batch
              removal is delayed by 5 s.

       <b>options : fdb_removal_limit</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              FDB aging bulk removal limit. This limits how many rows
              can expire in a single transaction. Default value is 0
              which is unlimited. When we hit the limit next batch
              removal is delayed by 5 s.

       <b>options : controller_event</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Value set by the CMS to enable/disable ovn-controller
              event reporting. Traffic into OVS can raise a ’controller’
              event that results in a Controller_Event being written to
              the <b>Controller_Event </b>table in SBDB. When the CMS has seen
              the event and taken appropriate action, it can remove the
              corresponding row in <b>Controller_Event </b>table. The intention
              is for a CMS to see the events and take some sort of
              action. Please see the <b>Controller_Event </b>table in SBDB. It
              is possible to associate a meter to each controller event
              type in order to not overload the pinctrl thread under
              heavy load. Each event type relies on a meter with a
              defined name:

              •      empty_lb_backends: event-elb

       <b>options : northd_probe_interval</b>: optional string
              The inactivity probe interval of the connection to the OVN
              Northbound and Southbound databases from <b>ovn-northd</b>, in
              milliseconds. If the value is zero, it disables the
              connection keepalive feature.

              If the value is nonzero, then it will be forced to a value
              of at least 1000 ms.

       <b>options : ic_probe_interval</b>: optional string
              The inactivity probe interval of the connection to the OVN
              Northbound and Southbound databases from <b>ovn-ic</b>, in
              milliseconds. If the value is zero, it disables the
              connection keepalive feature.

              If the value is nonzero, then it will be forced to a value
              of at least 1000 ms.

       <b>options : nbctl_probe_interval</b>: optional string
              The inactivity probe interval of the connection to the OVN
              Northbound database from <b>ovn-nbctl </b>utility, in
              milliseconds. If the value is zero, it disables the
              connection keepalive feature.

              If the value is nonzero, then it will be forced to a value
              of at least 1000 ms.

              If the value is less than zero, then the default
              inactivity probe interval for <b>ovn-nbctl </b>would be left
              intact (120000 ms).

       <b>options : northd_trim_timeout</b>: optional string
              When used, this configuration value specifies the time, in
              milliseconds, since the last <b>ovn-northd </b>active operation
              after which memory trimming is performed. By default this
              is set to 30000 (30 seconds).

       <b>options : use_logical_dp_groups</b>: optional string
              Note: This option is deprecated, the only behavior is to
              always combine logical flows by datapath groups. Changing
              the value or removing this option all toghether will have
              no effect.

              <b>ovn-northd </b>combines logical flows that differs only by
              logical datapath into a single logical flow with logical
              datapath group attached.

       <b>options : use_parallel_build</b>: optional string
              If set to <b>true</b>, <b>ovn-northd </b>will attempt to compute logical
              flows in parallel.

              Parallel computation is enabled only if the system has 4
              or more cores/threads available to be used by ovn-northd.

              The default value is <b>false</b>.

       <b>options : ignore_lsp_down</b>: optional string
              If set to false, ARP/ND reply flows for logical switch
              ports will be installed only if the port is up, i.e.
              claimed by a Chassis. If set to true, these flows are
              installed regardless of the status of the port, which can
              result in a situation that ARP request to an IP is
              resolved even before the relevant VM/container is running.
              For environments where this is not an issue, setting it to
              <b>true </b>can reduce the load and latency of the control plane.
              The default value is <b>true</b>.

       <b>options : use_ct_inv_match</b>: optional string
              If set to false, <b>ovn-northd </b>will not use the <b>ct.inv </b>field
              in any of the logical flow matches. The default value is
              true. If the NIC supports offloading OVS datapath flows
              but doesn’t support offloading ct_state <b>inv </b>flag, then the
              datapath flows matching on this flag (either <b>+inv </b>or <b>-inv</b>)
              will not be offloaded. CMS should consider setting
              <b>use_ct_inv_match </b>to <b>false </b>in such cases. This results in a
              side effect of the invalid packets getting delivered to
              the destination VIF, which otherwise would have been
              dropped by <b>OVN</b>.

       <b>options : default_acl_drop</b>: optional string
              If set to <b>true</b>., <b>ovn-northd </b>will generate a logical flow
              to drop all traffic in the ACL stages. By default this
              option is set to <b>false</b>.

       <b>options : debug_drop_domain_id</b>: optional string
              If set to a 8-bit number and if <b>debug_drop_collector_set</b>
              is also configured, <b>ovn-northd </b>will add a <b>sample </b>action to
              every logical flow that contains a ’drop’ action. The 8
              most significant bits of the observation_domain_id field
              will be those specified in the  <b>debug_drop_domain_id</b>. The
              24 least significant bits of the observation_domain_id
              field will be the datapath’s key.

              The observation_point_id will be set to the first 32 bits
              of the logical flow’s UUID.

       <b>options : debug_drop_collector_set</b>: optional string
              If set to a 32-bit number <b>ovn-northd </b>will add a <b>sample</b>
              action to every logical flow that contains a ’drop’
              action. The sample action will have the specified
              collector_set_id. The value must match that of the local
              OVS configuration as described in <a href="../man7/ovs-actions.7.html">ovs-actions(7)</a>.

       <b>options : use_common_zone</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Default value is <b>false</b>. If set to <b>true </b>the SNAT and DNAT
              happens in common zone, instead of happening in separate
              zones, depending on the configuration. However, this
              option breaks traffic when there is configuration of DGP +
              LB + SNAT on this LR. The value <b>true </b>should be used only
              in case of HWOL compatibility with GDP.

       <b>options : northd-backoff-interval-ms</b>: optional string
              Maximum interval that the northd incremental engine is
              delayed by in milliseconds. Setting the value to nonzero
              delays the next northd engine run by the previous run
              time, capped by the specified value. If the value is zero
              the engine won’t be delayed at all. The recommended period
              is smaller than 500 ms, beyond that the latency of SB
              changes would be very noticeable.

     <i>Options for configuring interconnection route advertisement:</i>

       These options control how routes are advertised between OVN
       deployments for interconnection. If enabled, <b>ovn-ic </b>from
       different OVN deployments exchanges routes between each other
       through the global <b>OVN_IC_Southbound </b>database. Only routers with
       ports connected to interconnection transit switches participate
       in route advertisement. For each of these routers, there are two
       types of routes to be advertised:

       Firstly, the static routes configured in the router are
       advertised.

       Secondly, the <b>networks </b>configured in the logical router ports
       that are not on the transit switches are advertised. These are
       considered as directly connected subnets on the router.

       Link local prefixes (IPv4 169.254.0.0/16 and IPv6 FE80::/10) are
       never advertised.

       The learned routes are added to the <b>static_routes </b>column of the
       <b>Logical_Router </b>table, with <b>external_ids:ic-learned-route </b>set to
       the uuid of the row in <b>Route </b>table of the <b>OVN_IC_Southbound</b>
       database.

       <b>options : ic-route-adv</b>: optional string
              A boolean value that enables route advertisement to the
              global <b>OVN_IC_Southbound </b>database. Default is <b>false</b>.

       <b>options : ic-route-learn</b>: optional string
              A boolean value that enables route learning from the
              global <b>OVN_IC_Southbound </b>database. Default is <b>false</b>.

       <b>options : ic-route-adv-default</b>: optional string
              A boolean value that enables advertising default route to
              the global <b>OVN_IC_Southbound </b>database. Default is <b>false</b>.
              This option takes effect only when option <b>ic-route-adv </b>is
              <b>true</b>.

       <b>options : ic-route-learn-default</b>: optional string
              A boolean value that enables learning default route from
              the global <b>OVN_IC_Southbound </b>database. Default is <b>false</b>.
              This option takes effect only when option <b>ic-route-learn</b>
              is <b>true</b>.

       <b>options : ic-route-denylist</b>: optional string
              A string value contains a list of CIDRs delimited by ",".
              A route will not be advertised or learned if the route’s
              prefix belongs to any of the CIDRs listed.

     <i>Connection Options:</i>

       <b>connections</b>: set of <b>Connection</b>s
              Database clients to which the Open vSwitch database server
              should connect or on which it should listen, along with
              options for how these connections should be configured.
              See the <b>Connection </b>table for more information.

       <b>ssl</b>: optional <b>SSL</b>
              Global SSL configuration.

     <i>Security Configurations:</i>

       <b>ipsec</b>: boolean
              Tunnel encryption configuration. If this column is set to
              be true, all OVN tunnels will be encrypted with IPsec.

     <i>Read-only Options:</i>

       <b>options : max_tunid</b>: optional string
              The maximum supported tunnel ID. Depends on types of
              encapsulation enabled in the cluster.

Logical_Switch TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Each row represents one L2 logical switch.

       There are two kinds of logical switches, that is, ones that fully
       virtualize the network (overlay logical switches) and ones that
       provide simple connectivity to physical networks (bridged logical
       switches). They work in the same way when providing connectivity
       between logical ports on same chassis, but differently when
       connecting remote logical ports. Overlay logical switches connect
       remote logical ports by tunnels, while bridged logical switches
       provide connectivity to remote ports by bridging the packets to
       directly connected physical L2 segments with the help of <b>localnet</b>
       ports. Each bridged logical switch has one or more <b>localnet</b>
       ports, which have only one special address <b>unknown</b>.

       <b>ports</b>: set of <b>Logical_Switch_Port</b>s
              The logical ports connected to the logical switch.

              It is an error for multiple logical switches to include
              the same logical port.

       <b>load_balancer</b>: set of weak reference to <b>Load_Balancer</b>s
              Set of load balancers associated to this logical switch.

       <b>load_balancer_group</b>: set of <b>Load_Balancer_Group</b>s
              Set of load balancers groups associated to this logical
              switch.

       <b>acls</b>: set of <b>ACL</b>s
              Access control rules that apply to packets within the
              logical switch.

       <b>qos_rules</b>: set of <b>QoS</b>es
              QoS marking and metering rules that apply to packets
              within the logical switch.

       <b>dns_records</b>: set of weak reference to <b>DNS</b>es
              This column defines the DNS records to be used for
              resolving internal DNS queries within the logical switch
              by the native DNS resolver. Please see the <b>DNS </b>table.

       <b>forwarding_groups</b>: set of <b>Forwarding_Group</b>s
              Groups a set of logical port endpoints for traffic going
              out of the logical switch.

     <i>Naming:</i>

       These columns provide names for the logical switch. From OVN’s
       perspective, these names have no special meaning or purpose other
       than to provide convenience for human interaction with the
       database. There is no requirement for the name to be unique. (For
       a unique identifier for a logical switch, use its row UUID.)

       (Originally, <b>name </b>was intended to serve the purpose of a human-
       friendly name, but the Neutron integration used it to uniquely
       identify its own switch object, in the format <b>neutron-</b><i>uuid</i>. Later
       on, Neutron started propagating the friendly name of a switch as
       <b>external_ids:neutron:network_name</b>. Perhaps this can be cleaned up
       someday.)

       <b>name</b>: string
              A name for the logical switch.

       <b>external_ids : neutron:network_name</b>: optional string
              Another name for the logical switch.

     <i>IP Address Assignment:</i>

       These options control automatic IP address management (IPAM) for
       ports attached to the logical switch. To enable IPAM for IPv4,
       set <b>other_config:subnet </b>and optionally <b>other_config:exclude_ips</b>.
       To enable IPAM for IPv6, set <b>other_config:ipv6_prefix</b>. IPv4 and
       IPv6 may be enabled together or separately.

       To request dynamic address assignment for a particular port, use
       the <b>dynamic </b>keyword in the <b>addresses </b>column of the port’s
       <b>Logical_Switch_Port </b>row. This requests both an IPv4 and an IPv6
       address, if IPAM for IPv4 and IPv6 are both enabled.

       <b>other_config : subnet</b>: optional string
              Set this to an IPv4 subnet, e.g. <b>192.168.0.0/24</b>, to enable
              <b>ovn-northd </b>to automatically assign IP addresses within
              that subnet.

       <b>other_config : exclude_ips</b>: optional string
              To exclude some addresses from automatic IP address
              management, set this to a list of the IPv4 addresses or
              <b>..</b>-delimited ranges to exclude. The addresses or ranges
              should be a subset of those in <b>other_config:subnet</b>.

              Whether listed or not, <b>ovn-northd </b>will never allocate the
              first or last address in a subnet, such as 192.168.0.0 or
              192.168.0.255 in 192.168.0.0/24.

              Examples:

              •      <b>192.168.0.2 192.168.0.10</b>

              •      <b>192.168.0.4 192.168.0.30..192.168.0.60</b>
                     <b>192.168.0.110..192.168.0.120</b>

              •      <b>192.168.0.110..192.168.0.120</b>
                     <b>192.168.0.25..192.168.0.30 192.168.0.144</b>

       <b>other_config : ipv6_prefix</b>: optional string
              Set this to an IPv6 prefix to enable <b>ovn-northd </b>to
              automatically assign IPv6 addresses using this prefix. The
              assigned IPv6 address will be generated using the IPv6
              prefix and the MAC address (converted to an IEEE EUI64
              identifier) of the port. The IPv6 prefix defined here
              should be a valid IPv6 address ending with <b>::</b>.

              Examples:

              •      <b>aef0::</b>

              •      <b>bef0:1234:a890:5678::</b>

              •      <b>8230:5678::</b>

       <b>other_config : dhcp_relay_port</b>: optional string
              If set to the name of logical switch port of type <b>router</b>
              then, DHCP Relay is enabled for this logical switch
              provided the corresponding <b>Logical_Router_Port </b>has DHCP
              Relay configured.

       <b>other_config : mac_only</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Value used to request to assign L2 address only if neither
              subnet nor ipv6_prefix are specified

       <b>other_config : fdb_age_threshold</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              FDB aging <b>threshold </b>value in seconds. FDB exceeding this
              timeout will be automatically removed. The value defaults
              to 0, which means disabled.

     <i>IP Multicast Snooping Options:</i>

       These options control IP Multicast Snooping configuration of the
       logical switch. To enable IP Multicast Snooping set
       <b>other_config:mcast_snoop </b>to true. To enable IP Multicast Querier
       set <b>other_config:mcast_querier </b>to true. If IP Multicast Querier
       is enabled <b>other_config:mcast_eth_src </b>and
       <b>other_config:mcast_ip4_src </b>must be set.

       <b>other_config : mcast_snoop</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Enables/disables IP Multicast Snooping on the logical
              switch. Default: <b>false</b>.

       <b>other_config : mcast_querier</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Enables/disables IP Multicast Querier on the logical
              switch. Only applicable if <b>other_config:mcast_snoop </b>is
              enabled. Default: <b>true</b>.

       <b>other_config : mcast_flood_unregistered</b>: optional string, either
       <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Determines whether unregistered multicast traffic should
              be flooded or not. Only applicable if
              <b>other_config:mcast_snoop </b>is enabled. Default: <b>false</b>.

       <b>other_config : mcast_table_size</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 32,766
              Number of multicast groups to be stored. Default: 2048.

       <b>other_config : mcast_idle_timeout</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 15 to 3,600
              Configures the IP Multicast Snooping group idle timeout
              (in seconds). Default: 300 seconds.

       <b>other_config : mcast_query_interval</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, in range 1 to 3,600
              Configures the IP Multicast Querier interval between
              queries (in seconds). Default:
              <b>other_config:mcast_idle_timeout </b>/ 2.

       <b>other_config : mcast_query_max_response</b>: optional string,
       containing an integer, in range 1 to 10
              Configures the value of the "max-response" field in the
              multicast queries originated by the logical switch.
              Default: 1 second.

       <b>other_config : mcast_eth_src</b>: optional string
              Configures the source Ethernet address for queries
              originated by the logical switch.

       <b>other_config : mcast_ip4_src</b>: optional string
              Configures the source IPv4 address for queries originated
              by the logical switch.

       <b>other_config : mcast_ip6_src</b>: optional string
              Configures the source IPv6 address for queries originated
              by the logical switch.

     <i>Interconnection:</i>

       <b>other_config : interconn-ts</b>: optional string
              The <b>name </b>of corresponding transit switch in
              <b>OVN_IC_Northbound </b>database. This kind of logical switch is
              created and controlled by <b>ovn-ic</b>.

     <i>Tunnel Key:</i>

       <b>other_config : requested-tnl-key</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 16,777,215
              Configures the datapath tunnel key for the logical switch.
              Usually this is not needed because <b>ovn-northd </b>will assign
              an unique key for each datapath by itself. However, if it
              is configured, <b>ovn-northd </b>honors the configured value. The
              typical use case is for interconnection: the tunnel keys
              for transit switches need to be unique globally, so they
              are maintained in the global <b>OVN_IC_Southbound </b>database,
              and <b>ovn-ic </b>simply syncs the value from <b>OVN_IC_Southbound</b>
              through this config.

       <b>copp</b>: optional weak reference to <b>Copp</b>
              The control plane protection policy from table <b>Copp </b>used
              for metering packets sent to <b>ovn-controller </b>from ports of
              this logical switch.

     <i>Other options:</i>

       <b>other_config : vlan-passthru</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Determines whether VLAN tagged incoming traffic should be
              allowed. Note that this may have security implications
              when enabled for a logical switch with a tag=0 localnet
              port. If not properly isolated from other localnet ports,
              fabric traffic that belongs to other tagged networks may
              be passed through such a port.

       <b>other_config : broadcast-arps-to-all-routers</b>: optional string,
       either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Determines whether arp requests and ipv6 neighbor
              solicitations should be sent to all routers and other
              switchports (default) or if it should only be sent to
              switchports where the ip/mac address is unknown. Setting
              this to false can significantly reduce the load if the
              logical switch can receive arp requests for ips it does
              not know about. However setting this to false also means
              that garps are no longer forwarded to all routers and
              therefor the mac bindings of the routers are no longer
              updated.

       <b>name</b>: string (must be unique within table)
              The logical port name.

              For entities (VMs or containers) that are spawned in the
              hypervisor, the name used here must match those used in
              the <b>external_ids:iface-id </b>in the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>database’s
              <b>Interface </b>table, because hypervisors use
              <b>external_ids:iface-id </b>as a lookup key to identify the
              network interface of that entity.

              For containers that share a VIF within a VM, the name can
              be any unique identifier. See <b>Containers</b>, below, for more
              information.

              A logical switch port may not have the same name as a
              logical router port, but the database schema cannot
              enforce this.

       <b>type</b>: string
              Specify a type for this logical port. Logical ports can be
              used to model other types of connectivity into an OVN
              logical switch. The following types are defined:

              (empty string)
                     A VM (or VIF) interface.

              <b>router </b>A connection to a logical router. The value of
                     <b>options:router-port </b>specifies the <b>name </b>of the
                     <b>Logical_Router_Port </b>to which this logical switch
                     port is connected.

              <b>localnet</b>
                     A connection to a locally accessible network from
                     <b>ovn-controller </b>instances that have a corresponding
                     bridge mapping. A logical switch can have multiple
                     <b>localnet </b>ports attached. This type is used to model
                     direct connectivity to existing networks. In this
                     case, each chassis should have a mapping for one of
                     the physical networks only. Note: nothing said
                     above implies that a chassis cannot be plugged to
                     multiple physical networks as long as they belong
                     to different switches.

              <b>localport</b>
                     A connection to a local VIF. Traffic that arrives
                     on a <b>localport </b>is never forwarded over a tunnel to
                     another chassis. These ports are present on every
                     chassis and have the same address in all of them.
                     This is used to model connectivity to local
                     services that run on every hypervisor.

              <b>l2gateway</b>
                     A connection to a physical network.

              <b>vtep   </b>A port to a logical switch on a VTEP gateway.

              <b>external</b>
                     Represents a logical port which is external and not
                     having an OVS port in the integration bridge. <b>OVN</b>
                     will never receive any traffic from this port or
                     send any traffic to this port. <b>OVN </b>can support
                     native services like DHCPv4/DHCPv6/DNS for this
                     port. If <b>ha_chassis_group </b>is defined,
                     <b>ovn-controller </b>running in the active chassis of the
                     HA chassis group will bind this port to provide
                     these native services. It is expected that this
                     port belong to a bridged logical switch (with a
                     <b>localnet </b>port).

                     It is recommended to use the same HA chassis group
                     for all the external ports of a logical switch.
                     Otherwise, the physical switch might see MAC flap
                     issue when different chassis provide the native
                     services. For example when supporting native DHCPv4
                     service, DHCPv4 server mac (configured in
                     <b>options:server_mac </b>column in table <b>DHCP_Options</b>)
                     originating from different ports can cause MAC flap
                     issue. The MAC of the logical router IP(s) can also
                     flap if the same HA chassis group is not set for
                     all the external ports of a logical switch.

                     Below are some of the use cases where <b>external</b>
                     ports can be used.

                     •      VMs connected to SR-IOV nics - Traffic from
                            these VMs by passes the kernel stack and
                            local <b>ovn-controller </b>do not bind these ports
                            and cannot serve the native services.

                     •      When CMS supports provisioning baremetal
                            servers.

              <b>virtual</b>
                     Represents a logical port which does not have an
                     OVS port in the integration bridge and has a
                     virtual ip configured in the <b>options:virtual-ip</b>
                     column. This virtual ip can move around between the
                     logical ports configured in the <b>options:virtual-</b>
                     <b>parents </b>column.

                     One of the use case where <b>virtual </b>ports can be used
                     is.

                     •      The <b>virtual ip </b>represents a load balancer
                            vip and the <b>virtual parents </b>provide load
                            balancer service in an active-standby setup
                            with the active virtual parent owning the
                            <b>virtual ip</b>.

              <b>remote </b>A remote port is to model a port that resides
                     remotely on another OVN, which is on the other side
                     of a transit logical switch for OVN
                     interconnection. This type of ports are created by
                     <b>ovn-ic </b>instead of by CMS. Any change to the port
                     will be automatically overwritten by <b>ovn-ic</b>.

     <i>Options:</i>

       <b>options</b>: map of string-string pairs
              This column provides key/value settings specific to the
              logical port <b>type</b>. The type-specific options are described
              individually below.

     <i>Options for router ports:</i>

       These options apply when <b>type </b>is <b>router</b>.

       <b>options : router-port</b>: optional string
              Required. The <b>name </b>of the <b>Logical_Router_Port </b>to which
              this logical switch port is connected.

       <b>options : nat-addresses</b>: optional string
              This is used to send gratuitous ARPs for SNAT and DNAT IP
              addresses via the <b>localnet </b>port that is attached to the
              same logical switch as this type <b>router </b>port. This option
              is specified on a logical switch port that is connected to
              a gateway router, or a logical switch port that is
              connected to a distributed gateway port on a logical
              router.

              This must take one of the following forms:

              <b>router </b>Gratuitous ARPs will be sent for all SNAT and DNAT
                     external IP addresses and for all load balancer IP
                     addresses defined on the <b>options:router-port</b>’s
                     logical router, using the <b>options:router-port</b>’s MAC
                     address.

                     This form of <b>options:nat-addresses </b>is valid for
                     logical switch ports where <b>options:router-port </b>is
                     the name of a port on a gateway router, or the name
                     of a distributed gateway port.

                     Supported only in OVN 2.8 and later. Earlier
                     versions required NAT addresses to be manually
                     synchronized.

              <b>Ethernet address followed by one or more IPv4 addresses</b>
                     Example: <b>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 158.36.44.22</b>
                     <b>158.36.44.24</b>. This would result in generation of
                     gratuitous ARPs for IP addresses 158.36.44.22 and
                     158.36.44.24 with a MAC address of
                     80:fa:5b:06:72:b7.

                     This form of <b>options:nat-addresses </b>is only valid
                     for logical switch ports where <b>options:router-port</b>
                     is the name of a port on a gateway router.

       <b>options : exclude-lb-vips-from-garp</b>: optional string
              If <b>options:nat-addresses </b>is set to <b>router</b>, Gratuitous ARPs
              will be sent for all SNAT and DNAT external IP addresses
              defined on the <b>options:router-port</b>’s logical router, using
              the <b>options:router-port</b>’s MAC address, not cosidering
              configured load balancers.

       <b>options : arp_proxy</b>: optional string
              Optional. A list of MAC and addresses/cidrs or just
              addresses/cidrs that this logical switch <b>router </b>port will
              reply to ARP/NDP requests. Examples: <b>169.254.239.254</b>
              <b>169.254.239.2</b>, <b>0a:58:a9:fe:01:01 169.254.239.254</b>
              <b>169.254.239.2 169.254.238.0/24</b>, <b>fd7b:6b4d:7b25:d22f::1</b>
              <b>fd7b:6b4d:7b25:d22f::2</b>, <b>0a:58:a9:fe:01:01</b>
              <b>fd7b:6b4d:7b25:d22f::0/64</b>. The<b>options:router-port</b>’s
              logical router should have a route to forward packets sent
              to configured proxy ARP MAC/IPs to an appropriate
              destination.

       <b>options : enable_router_port_acl</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Optional. Enable conntrack for the router port whose peer
              is l3dgw_port if set to <b>true</b>. The default value is <b>false</b>.

     <i>Options for localnet ports:</i>

       These options apply when <b>type </b>is <b>localnet</b>.

       <b>options : network_name</b>: optional string
              Required. The name of the network to which the <b>localnet</b>
              port is connected. Each hypervisor, via <b>ovn-controller</b>,
              uses its local configuration to determine exactly how to
              connect to this locally accessible network, if at all.

       <b>options : ethtype</b>: optional string
              Optional. VLAN EtherType field value for encapsulating
              VLAN headers. Supported values: 802.1q (default), 802.1ad.

       <b>options : localnet_learn_fdb</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Optional. Allows localnet port to learn MACs and store
              them in FDB table if set to <b>true</b>. The default value is
              <b>false</b>.

     <i>Options for l2gateway ports:</i>

       These options apply when <b>type </b>is <b>l2gateway</b>.

       <b>options : network_name</b>: optional string
              Required. The name of the network to which the <b>l2gateway</b>
              port is connected. The L2 gateway, via <b>ovn-controller</b>,
              uses its local configuration to determine exactly how to
              connect to this network.

       <b>options : l2gateway-chassis</b>: optional string
              Required. The chassis on which the <b>l2gateway </b>logical port
              should be bound to. <b>ovn-controller </b>running on the defined
              chassis will connect this logical port to the physical
              network.

     <i>Options for vtep ports:</i>

       These options apply when <b>type </b>is <b>vtep</b>.

       <b>options : vtep-physical-switch</b>: optional string
              Required. The name of the VTEP gateway.

       <b>options : vtep-logical-switch</b>: optional string
              Required. A logical switch name connected by the VTEP
              gateway.

     <i>VMI (or VIF) Options:</i>

       These options apply to logical ports with <b>type </b>having (empty
       string)

       <b>options : requested-chassis</b>: optional string
              If set, identifies a specific chassis (by name or
              hostname) that is allowed to bind this port. Using this
              option will prevent thrashing between two chassis trying
              to bind the same port during a live migration. It can also
              prevent similar thrashing due to a mis-configuration, if a
              port is accidentally created on more than one chassis.

              If set to a comma separated list, the first entry
              identifies the main chassis and the rest are one or more
              additional chassis that are allowed to bind the same port.

              When multiple chassis are set for the port, and the
              logical switch is connected to an external network through
              a <b>localnet </b>port, tunneling is enforced for the port to
              guarantee delivery of packets directed to the port to all
              its locations. This has MTU implications because the
              network used for tunneling must have MTU larger than
              <b>localnet </b>for stable connectivity.

              If the same host co-hosts more than one controller
              instance (either belonging to the same or separate
              clusters), special attention should be given to
              consistently using unique chassis names used in this
              option. It is advised that chassis names - and not host
              names - are used for this option.

       <b>options : activation-strategy</b>: optional string
              If used with multiple chassis set in <b>requested-chassis</b>,
              specifies an activation strategy for all additional
              chassis. By default, no activation strategy is used,
              meaning additional port locations are immediately
              available for use. When set to "rarp", the port is blocked
              for ingress and egress communication until a RARP packet
              is sent from a new location. The "rarp" strategy is useful
              in live migration scenarios for virtual machines.

       <b>options : iface-id-ver</b>: optional string
              If set, this port will be bound by <b>ovn-controller </b>only if
              this same key and value is configured in the <b>external_ids</b>
              column in the Open_vSwitch database’s <b>Interface </b>table.

       <b>options : qos_min_rate</b>: optional string
              If set, indicates the minimum guaranteed rate available
              for data sent from this interface, in bit/s.

       <b>options : qos_max_rate</b>: optional string
              If set, indicates the maximum rate for data sent from this
              interface, in bit/s. The traffic will be shaped according
              to this limit.

       <b>options : qos_burst</b>: optional string
              If set, indicates the maximum burst size for data sent
              from this interface, in bits.

       <b>options : hostname</b>: optional string
              If set, indicates the DHCPv4 option "Hostname" (option
              code 12) associated for this Logical Switch Port. If
              DHCPv4 is enabled for this Logical Switch Port, hostname
              dhcp option will be included in DHCP reply.

       <b>options : force_fdb_lookup</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              This option is supported only if the Logical Switch Port
              is of default <b>type </b>(i.e. type set to empty_string) and
              also <b>addresses </b>column contains <b>unknown</b>. If set to <b>true</b>,
              MAC addresses (if configured) are not installed in the l2
              lookup table but the MAC addresses are learnt and stored
              in the FDB table. The default value is <b>false</b>.

       <b>options : pkt_clone_type</b>: optional string, must be <b>mc_unknown</b>
              If set to mc_unknown, packets going to this VIF get cloned
              to all unknown ports connected to the same Logical Switch.

       <b>options : disable_arp_nd_rsp</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, ARP/ND responder flows are not installed
              for the IP addresses configured on this logical port.
              Default: <b>false</b>.

     <i>VIF Plugging Options:</i>

       <b>options : vif-plug-type</b>: optional string
              If set, OVN will attempt to perform plugging of this VIF.
              In order to get this port plugged by the OVN controller,
              OVN must be built with support for VIF plugging. The
              default behavior is for the CMS to do the VIF plugging.
              Each VIF plug provider have their own options namespaced
              by name, for example "vif-plug:representor:key". Please
              refer to the VIF plug provider documentation located in
              Documentation/topics/vif-plug-providers/ for more
              information.

       <b>options : vif-plug-mtu-request</b>: optional string
              Requested MTU for plugged interfaces. When set the OVN
              controller will fill the <b>mtu_request </b>column of the Open
              vSwitch database’s <b>Interface </b>table. This in turn will make
              OVS vswitchd update the MTU of the linked interface.

     <i>Virtual port Options:</i>

       These options apply when <b>type </b>is <b>virtual</b>.

       <b>options : virtual-ip</b>: optional string
              This option represents the virtual IPv4 address.

       <b>options : virtual-parents</b>: optional string
              This options represents a set of logical port names (with
              in the same logical switch) which can own the <b>virtual ip</b>
              configured in the <b>options:virtual-ip</b>. All these virtual
              parents should add the <b>virtual ip </b>in the <b>port_security </b>if
              port security addressed are enabled.

     <i>IP Multicast Snooping Options:</i>

       These options apply when the port is part of a logical switch
       which has <b>other_config </b>:mcast_snoop set to <b>true</b>.

       <b>options : mcast_flood</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, multicast packets (except reports) are
              unconditionally forwarded to the specific port. Default:
              <b>false</b>.

       <b>options : mcast_flood_reports</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, multicast reports are unconditionally
              forwarded to the specific port. Default: <b>false</b>.

     <i>Containers:</i>

       When a large number of containers are nested within a VM, it may
       be too expensive to dedicate a VIF to each container. OVN can use
       VLAN tags to support such cases. Each container is assigned a
       VLAN ID and each packet that passes between the hypervisor and
       the VM is tagged with the appropriate ID for the container. Such
       VLAN IDs never appear on a physical wire, even inside a tunnel,
       so they need not be unique except relative to a single VM on a
       hypervisor.

       These columns are used for VIFs that represent nested containers
       using shared VIFs. For VMs and for containers that have dedicated
       VIFs, they are empty.

       <b>parent_name</b>: optional string
              The VM interface through which the nested container sends
              its network traffic. This must match the <b>name </b>column for
              some other <b>Logical_Switch_Port</b>. Note: for performance of
              the OVN Southbound database conditional monitoring, unlike
              for regular VIFs, <b>ovn-controller </b>will register to get
              updates about all OVN Southbound database <b>Port_Binding</b>
              table records that correspond to nested container ports
              even if <b>external_ids:ovn-monitor-all </b>is set to <b>false</b>. See
              <a href="../man8/ovn-controller.8.html">ovn-controller(8)</a> for more information.

       <b>tag_request</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095
              The VLAN tag in the network traffic associated with a
              container’s network interface. The client can request
              <b>ovn-northd </b>to allocate a tag that is unique within the
              scope of a specific parent (specified in <b>parent_name</b>) by
              setting a value of <b>0 </b>in this column. The allocated value
              is written by <b>ovn-northd </b>in the <b>tag </b>column. (Note that
              these tags are allocated and managed locally in
              <b>ovn-northd</b>, so they cannot be reconstructed in the event
              that the database is lost.) The client can also request a
              specific non-zero tag and <b>ovn-northd </b>will honor it and
              copy that value to the <b>tag </b>column.

              When <b>type </b>is set to <b>localnet </b>or <b>l2gateway</b>, this can be set
              to indicate that the port represents a connection to a
              specific VLAN on a locally accessible network. The VLAN ID
              is used to match incoming traffic and is also added to
              outgoing traffic.

       <b>tag</b>: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              The VLAN tag allocated by <b>ovn-northd </b>based on the contents
              of the <b>tag_request </b>column.

     <i>Port State:</i>

       <b>up</b>: optional boolean
              This column is populated by <b>ovn-northd</b>, rather than by the
              CMS plugin as is most of this database. When a logical
              port is bound to a physical location in the OVN Southbound
              database <b>Binding </b>table, <b>ovn-northd </b>sets this column to
              <b>true</b>; otherwise, or if the port becomes unbound later, it
              sets it to <b>false</b>. If this column is empty, the port is not
              considered up. This allows the CMS to wait for a VM’s (or
              container’s) networking to become active before it allows
              the VM (or container) to start.

              Logical ports of router type are an exception to this
              rule. They are considered to be always up, that is this
              column is always set to <b>true</b>.

       <b>enabled</b>: optional boolean
              This column is used to administratively set port state. If
              this column is empty or is set to <b>true</b>, the port is
              enabled. If this column is set to <b>false</b>, the port is
              disabled. A disabled port has all ingress and egress
              traffic dropped.

     <i>Addressing:</i>

       <b>addresses</b>: set of strings
              Addresses owned by the logical port.

              Each element in the set must take one of the following
              forms:

              <b>Ethernet address followed by zero or more IPv4 or IPv6</b>
              <b>addresses (or both)</b>
                     An Ethernet address defined is owned by the logical
                     port. Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port
                     ordinarily has a single fixed Ethernet address.

                     When a OVN logical switch processes a unicast
                     Ethernet frame whose destination MAC address is in
                     a logical port’s <b>addresses </b>column, it delivers it
                     only to that port, as if a MAC learning process had
                     learned that MAC address on the port.

                     If IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) (or both) are defined,
                     it indicates that the logical port owns the given
                     IP addresses.

                     If IPv4 address(es) are defined, the OVN logical
                     switch uses this information to synthesize
                     responses to ARP requests without traversing the
                     physical network. The OVN logical router connected
                     to the logical switch, if any, uses this
                     information to avoid issuing ARP requests for
                     logical switch ports.

                     Note that the order here is important. The Ethernet
                     address must be listed before the IP address(es) if
                     defined.

                     Examples:

                     <b>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7</b>
                            This indicates that the logical port owns
                            the above mac address.

                     <b>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 10.0.0.4 20.0.0.4</b>
                            This indicates that the logical port owns
                            the mac address and two IPv4 addresses.

                     <b>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7</b>
                     <b>fdaa:15f2:72cf:0:f816:3eff:fe20:3f41</b>
                            This indicates that the logical port owns
                            the mac address and 1 IPv6 address.

                     <b>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 10.0.0.4</b>
                     <b>fdaa:15f2:72cf:0:f816:3eff:fe20:3f41</b>
                            This indicates that the logical port owns
                            the mac address and 1 IPv4 address and 1
                            IPv6 address.

              <b>unknown</b>
                     This indicates that the logical port has an unknown
                     set of Ethernet addresses. When an OVN logical
                     switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame whose
                     destination MAC address is not in any logical
                     port’s <b>addresses </b>column, it delivers it to the port
                     (or ports) whose <b>addresses </b>columns include <b>unknown</b>.

              <b>dynamic</b>
                     Use <b>dynamic </b>to make <b>ovn-northd </b>generate a globally
                     unique MAC address, choose an unused IPv4 address
                     with the logical port’s subnet (if
                     <b>other_config:subnet </b>is set in the port’s
                     <b>Logical_Switch</b>), and generate an IPv6 address from
                     the MAC address (if <b>other_config:ipv6_prefix </b>is set
                     in the port’s <b>Logical_Switch</b>) and store them in the
                     port’s <b>dynamic_addresses </b>column.

                     Only one element containing <b>dynamic </b>may appear in
                     <b>addresses</b>.

              <b>dynamic </b><i>ip</i>
              <b>dynamic </b><i>ipv6</i>
              <b>dynamic </b><i>ip ipv6</i>
                   These act like <b>dynamic </b>alone but specify particular
                   IPv4 or IPv6 addresses to use. OVN IPAM will still
                   automatically allocate the other address if
                   configured appropriately. Example: <b>dynamic</b>
                   <b>192.168.0.1 2001::1</b>.

              <i>mac</i> <b>dynamic</b>
                   This acts like <b>dynamic </b>alone but specifies a
                   particular MAC address to use. OVN IPAM will still
                   automatically allocate IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, or
                   both, if configured appropriately. Example:
                   <b>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 dynamic</b>

              <b>router</b>
                   Accepted only when <b>type </b>is <b>router</b>. This indicates
                   that the Ethernet, IPv4, and IPv6 addresses for this
                   logical switch port should be obtained from the
                   connected logical router port, as specified by
                   <b>router-port </b>in <b>options</b>.

                   The resulting addresses are used to populate the
                   logical switch’s destination lookup, and also for the
                   logical switch to generate ARP and ND replies.

                   If the connected logical router port has a
                   distributed gateway port specified and the logical
                   router has rules specified in <b>nat </b>with <b>external_mac</b>,
                   then those addresses are also used to populate the
                   switch’s destination lookup.

                   Supported only in OVN 2.7 and later. Earlier versions
                   required router addresses to be manually
                   synchronized.

       <b>dynamic_addresses</b>: optional string
              Addresses assigned to the logical port by <b>ovn-northd</b>, if
              <b>dynamic </b>is specified in <b>addresses</b>. Addresses will be of
              the same format as those that populate the <b>addresses</b>
              column. Note that dynamically assigned addresses are
              constructed and managed locally in ovn-northd, so they
              cannot be reconstructed in the event that the database is
              lost.

       <b>port_security</b>: set of strings
              This column controls the addresses from which the host
              attached to the logical port (``the host’’) is allowed to
              send packets and to which it is allowed to receive
              packets. If this column is empty, all addresses are
              permitted.

              Each element in the set must begin with one Ethernet
              address. This would restrict the host to sending packets
              from and receiving packets to the ethernet addresses
              defined in the logical port’s <b>port_security </b>column. It
              also restricts the inner source MAC addresses that the
              host may send in ARP and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets.
              The host is always allowed to receive packets to multicast
              and broadcast Ethernet addresses.

              Each element in the set may additionally contain one or
              more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses (or both), with optional
              masks. If a mask is given, it must be a CIDR mask. In
              addition to the restrictions described for Ethernet
              addresses above, such an element restricts the IPv4 or
              IPv6 addresses from which the host may send and to which
              it may receive packets to the specified addresses. A
              masked address, if the host part is zero, indicates that
              the host is allowed to use any address in the subnet; if
              the host part is nonzero, the mask simply indicates the
              size of the subnet. In addition:

              •      If any IPv4 address is given, the host is also
                     allowed to receive packets to the IPv4 local
                     broadcast address 255.255.255.255 and to IPv4
                     multicast addresses (224.0.0.0/4). If an IPv4
                     address with a mask is given, the host is also
                     allowed to receive packets to the broadcast address
                     in that specified subnet.

                     If any IPv4 address is given, the host is
                     additionally restricted to sending ARP packets with
                     the specified source IPv4 address. (RARP is not
                     restricted.)

              •      If any IPv6 address is given, the host is also
                     allowed to receive packets to IPv6 multicast
                     addresses (ff00::/8).

                     If any IPv6 address is given, the host is
                     additionally restricted to sending IPv6 Neighbor
                     Discovery Solicitation or Advertisement packets
                     with the specified source address or, for
                     solicitations, the unspecified address.

              If an element includes an IPv4 address, but no IPv6
              addresses, then IPv6 traffic is not allowed. If an element
              includes an IPv6 address, but no IPv4 address, then IPv4
              and ARP traffic is not allowed.

              This column uses the same lexical syntax as the <b>match</b>
              column in the OVN Southbound database’s <b>Pipeline </b>table.
              Multiple addresses within an element may be space or comma
              separated.

              This column is provided as a convenience to cloud
              management systems, but all of the features that it
              implements can be implemented as ACLs using the <b>ACL </b>table.

              Examples:

              <b>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7</b>
                     The host may send traffic from and receive traffic
                     to the specified MAC address, and to receive
                     traffic to Ethernet multicast and broadcast
                     addresses, but not otherwise. The host may not send
                     ARP or IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets with inner
                     source Ethernet addresses other than the one
                     specified.

              <b>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 192.168.1.10/24</b>
                     This adds further restrictions to the first
                     example. The host may send IPv4 packets from or
                     receive IPv4 packets to only 192.168.1.10, except
                     that it may also receive IPv4 packets to
                     192.168.1.255 (based on the subnet mask),
                     255.255.255.255, and any address in 224.0.0.0/4.
                     The host may not send ARPs with a source Ethernet
                     address other than 80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 or source IPv4
                     address other than 192.168.1.10. The host may not
                     send or receive any IPv6 (including IPv6 Neighbor
                     Discovery) traffic.

              <b>"80:fa:5b:12:42:ba", "80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 192.168.1.10/24"</b>
                     The host may send traffic from and receive traffic
                     to the specified MAC addresses, and to receive
                     traffic to Ethernet multicast and broadcast
                     addresses, but not otherwise. With MAC
                     80:fa:5b:12:42:ba, the host may send traffic from
                     and receive traffic to any L3 address. With MAC
                     80:fa:5b:06:72:b7, the host may send IPv4 packets
                     from or receive IPv4 packets to only 192.168.1.10,
                     except that it may also receive IPv4 packets to
                     192.168.1.255 (based on the subnet mask),
                     255.255.255.255, and any address in 224.0.0.0/4.
                     The host may not send or receive any IPv6
                     (including IPv6 Neighbor Discovery) traffic.

     <i>DHCP:</i>

       <b>dhcpv4_options</b>: optional weak reference to <b>DHCP_Options</b>
              This column defines the DHCPv4 Options to be included by
              the <b>ovn-controller </b>when it replies to the DHCPv4 requests.
              Please see the <b>DHCP_Options </b>table.

       <b>dhcpv6_options</b>: optional weak reference to <b>DHCP_Options</b>
              This column defines the DHCPv6 Options to be included by
              the <b>ovn-controller </b>when it replies to the DHCPv6 requests.
              Please see the <b>DHCP_Options </b>table.

       <b>mirror_rules</b>: set of weak reference to <b>Mirror</b>s
              Mirror rules that apply to logical switch port which is
              the source. Please see the <b>Mirror </b>table.

       <b>ha_chassis_group</b>: optional <b>HA_Chassis_Group</b>
              References a row in the OVN Northbound database’s
              <b>HA_Chassis_Group </b>table. It indicates the HA chassis group
              to use if the <b>type </b>is set to <b>external</b>. If <b>type </b>is not
              <b>external</b>, this column is ignored.

     <i>Naming:</i>

       <b>external_ids : neutron:port_name</b>: optional string
              This column gives an optional human-friendly name for the
              port. This name has no special meaning or purpose other
              than to provide convenience for human interaction with the
              northbound database.

              Neutron copies this from its own port object’s name.
              (Neutron ports do are not assigned human-friendly names by
              default, so it will often be empty.)

     <i>Tunnel Key:</i>

       <b>options : requested-tnl-key</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 32,767
              Configures the port binding tunnel key for the port.
              Usually this is not needed because <b>ovn-northd </b>will assign
              an unique key for each port by itself. However, if it is
              configured, <b>ovn-northd </b>honors the configured value. The
              typical use case is for interconnection: the tunnel keys
              for ports on transit switches need to be unique globally,
              so they are maintained in the global <b>OVN_IC_Southbound</b>
              database, and <b>ovn-ic </b>simply syncs the value from
              <b>OVN_IC_Southbound </b>through this config.

     <i>Common Columns:</i>

       <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs
              See <b>External IDs </b>at the beginning of this document.

              The <b>ovn-northd </b>program copies all these pairs into the
              <b>external_ids </b>column of the <b>Port_Binding </b>table in
              <b>OVN_Southbound </b>database.

Address_Set TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Each row in this table represents a named set of addresses. An
       address set may contain Ethernet, IPv4, or IPv6 addresses with
       optional bitwise or CIDR masks. Address set may ultimately be
       used in ACLs to compare against fields such as <b>ip4.src </b>or
       <b>ip6.src</b>. A single address set must contain addresses of the same
       type. As an example, the following would create an address set
       with three IP addresses:

             <b>ovn-nbctl create Address_Set name=set1 addresses=’10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3’</b>

       Address sets may be used in the <b>match </b>column of the <b>ACL </b>table.

                                     <b>false</b>

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>name</b>: string
              A name for the load balancer. This name has no special
              meaning or purpose other than to provide convenience for
              human interaction with the ovn-nb database.

       <b>vips</b>: map of string-string pairs
              A map of virtual IP addresses (and an optional port number
              with <b>: </b>as a separator) associated with this load balancer
              and their corresponding endpoint IP addresses (and
              optional port numbers with <b>: </b>as separators) separated by
              commas. If the destination IP address (and port number) of
              a packet leaving a container or a VM matches the virtual
              IP address (and port number) provided here as a key, then
              OVN will statefully replace the destination IP address by
              one of the provided IP address (and port number) in this
              map as a value. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported for
              load balancing; however a VIP of one address family may
              not be mapped to a destination IP address of a different
              family. If specifying an IPv6 address with a port, the
              address portion must be enclosed in square brackets.
              Examples for keys are "192.168.1.4" and "[fd0f::1]:8800".
              Examples for value are "10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2" and
              "20.0.0.10:8800, 20.0.0.11:8800".

              When the <b>Load_Balancer </b>is added to the <b>logical_switch</b>, the
              VIP has to be in a different subnet than the one used for
              the <b>logical_switch</b>. Since VIP is in a different subnet,
              you should connect your logical switch to either a OVN
              logical router or a real router (this is because the
              client can now send a packet with VIP as the destination
              IP address and router’s mac address as the destination MAC
              address).

       <b>protocol</b>: optional string, one of <b>sctp</b>, <b>tcp</b>, or <b>udp</b>
              Valid protocols are <b>tcp</b>, <b>udp</b>, or <b>sctp</b>. This column is
              useful when a port number is provided as part of the <b>vips</b>
              column. If this column is empty and a port number is
              provided as part of <b>vips </b>column, OVN assumes the protocol
              to be <b>tcp</b>.

     <i>Health Checks:</i>

       OVN supports health checks for load balancer endpoints. When
       health checks are enabled, the load balancer uses only healthy
       endpoints.

       Suppose that <b>vips </b>contains a key-value pair
       <b>10.0.0.10:80</b>=<b>10.0.0.4:8080,20.0.0.4:8080</b>. To enable health checks
       for this virtual’s endpoints, add two key-value pairs to
       <b>ip_port_mappings</b>, with keys <b>10.0.0.4 </b>and <b>20.0.0.4</b>, and add to
       <b>health_check </b>a reference to a <b>Load_Balancer_Health_Check </b>row
       whose <b>vip </b>is set to <b>10.0.0.10</b>. The same approach can be used for
       IPv6 as well.

       <b>health_check</b>: set of <b>Load_Balancer_Health_Check</b>s
              Load balancer health checks associated with this load
              balancer.

       <b>ip_port_mappings</b>: map of string-string pairs
              Maps from endpoint IP to a colon-separated pair of logical
              port name and source IP, e.g. <i>port_name</i><b>:</b><i>sourc_ip</i> for IPv4.
              Health checks are sent to this port with the specified
              source IP. For IPv6 square brackets must be used around IP
              address, e.g: <i>port_name</i><b>:</b><i>[sourc_ip]</i>

              For example, in the example above, IP to port mappings
              might be defined as <b>10.0.0.4</b>=<b>sw0-p1:10.0.0.2 </b>and
              <b>20.0.0.4</b>=<b>sw1-p1:20.0.0.2</b>, if the values given were
              suitable ports and IP addresses.

              For IPv6 IP to port mappings might be defined as
              <b>[2001::1]</b>=<b>sw0-p1:[2002::1]</b>.

       <b>selection_fields</b>: set of strings, one of <b>eth_dst</b>, <b>eth_src</b>,
       <b>ip_dst</b>, <b>ip_src</b>, <b>tp_dst</b>, or <b>tp_src</b>
              OVN native load balancers are supported using the OpenFlow
              groups of type <b>select</b>. OVS supports two selection methods:
              <b>dp_hash </b>and <b>hash (with optional fields specified) </b>in
              selecting the buckets of a group. Please see the OVS
              documentation (man ovs-ofctl) for more details on the
              selection methods. Each endpoint IP (and port if set) is
              mapped to a bucket in the group flow.

              CMS can choose the <b>hash </b>selection method by setting the
              selection fields in this column. <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>uses the
              specified fields in generating the hash.

              <b>dp_hash </b>selection method uses the assistance of datapath
              to calculate the hash and it is expected to be faster than
              <b>hash </b>selection method. So CMS should take this into
              consideration before using the <b>hash </b>method. Please consult
              the OVS documentation and OVS sources for the
              implementation details.

     <i>Load_Balancer options:</i>

       <b>options : reject</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If the load balancer is created with <b>--reject </b>option and
              it has no active backends, a TCP reset segment (for tcp)
              or an ICMP port unreachable packet (for all other kind of
              traffic) will be sent whenever an incoming packet is
              received for this load-balancer. Please note using
              <b>--reject </b>option will disable empty_lb SB controller event
              for this load balancer.

       <b>options : hairpin_snat_ip</b>: optional string
              IP to be used as source IP for packets that have been
              hair-pinned after load balancing. The default behavior
              when the option is not set is to use the load balancer VIP
              as source IP. This option may have exactly one IPv4 and/or
              one IPv6 address on it, separated by a space character.

       <b>options : skip_snat</b>: optional string
              If the load balancing rule is configured with <b>skip_snat</b>
              option, the option lb_force_snat_ip configured for the
              logical router that references this load balancer will not
              be applied for this load balancer.

       <b>options : add_route</b>: optional string
              If set to <b>true</b>, then neighbor routers will have logical
              flows added that will allow for routing to the VIP IP. It
              also will have ARP resolution logical flows added. By
              setting this option, it means there is no reason to create
              a <b>Logical_Router_Static_Route </b>from neighbor routers to
              this NAT address. It also means that no ARP request is
              required for neighbor routers to learn the IP-MAC mapping
              for this VIP IP. For more information about what flows are
              added for IP routes, please see the <b>ovn-northd </b>manpage
              section on IP Routing.

       <b>options : neighbor_responder</b>: optional string
              If set to <b>all</b>, then routers on which the load balancer is
              applied reply to ARP/neighbor discovery requests for all
              VIPs of the load balancer. If set to <b>reachable</b>, then
              routers on which the load balancer is applied reply to
              ARP/neighbor discovery requests only for VIPs that are
              part of a router’s subnet. If set to <b>none</b>, then routers on
              which the load balancer is applied never reply to
              ARP/neighbor discovery requests for any of the load
              balancer VIPs. Load balancers with <b>options:template=true</b>
              do not support <b>reachable </b>as a valid mode. The default
              value of this option, if not specified, is <b>reachable </b>for
              regular load balancers and <b>none </b>for template load
              balancers.

       <b>options : template</b>: optional string
              Option to be set to <b>true</b>, if the load balancer is a
              template. The load balancer VIPs and backends must be
              using <b>Chassis_Template_Var </b>in their definitions.

              Load balancer template VIP supported formats are:

              <b>^VIP_VAR[:^PORT_VAR|:port]</b>

              where <b>VIP_VAR </b>and <b>PORT_VAR </b>are keys of the
              <b>Chassis_Template_Var variables </b>records.

              Note: The VIP and PORT cannot be combined into a single
              template variable. For example, a <b>Chassis_Template_Var</b>
              variable expanding to <b>10.0.0.1:8080 </b>is not valid if used
              as VIP.

              Load balancer template backend supported formats are:

              <b>^BACKEND_VAR1[:^PORT_VAR1|:port],^BACKEND_VAR2[:^PORT_VAR2|:port]</b>
              <b>or</b>
              <b>^BACKENDS_VAR1,^BACKENDS_VAR2</b>

              where <b>BACKEND_VAR1</b>, <b>PORT_VAR1</b>, <b>BACKEND_VAR2</b>, <b>PORT_VAR2</b>,
              <b>BACKENDS_VAR1 </b>and <b>BACKENDS_VAR2 </b>are keys of the
              <b>Chassis_Template_Var variables </b>records.

       <b>options : address-family</b>: optional string
              Address family used by the load balancer. Supported values
              are <b>ipv4 </b>and <b>ipv6</b>. The address-family is only used for
              load balancers with <b>options:template=true</b>. For explicit
              load balancers, setting the address-family has no effect.

       <b>options : affinity_timeout</b>: optional string
              If the CMS provides a positive value (in seconds) for
              <b>affinity_timeout</b>, OVN will dnat connections received from
              the same client to this lb to the same backend if received
              in the affinity timeslot. Max supported affinity_timeout
              is 65535 seconds.

       <b>options : ct_flush</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              The value indicates whether ovn-controller should flush CT
              entries that are related to this LB. The flush happens if
              the LB is removed, any of the backends is updated/removed
              or the LB is not considered local anymore by the ovn-
              controller. This option is set to <b>false </b>by default.

ACL TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Each row in this table represents one ACL rule for a logical
       switch or a port group that points to it through its <b>acls </b>column.
       The <b>action </b>column for the highest-<b>priority </b>matching row in this
       table determines a packet’s treatment. If no row matches, packets
       are allowed by default. (Default-deny treatment is possible: add
       a rule with <b>priority </b>0, <b>1 </b>as <b>match</b>, and <b>deny </b>as <b>action</b>.)

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>label</b>: integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              Associates an identifier with the ACL. The same value will
              be written to corresponding connection tracker entry. The
              value should be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer. This
              value can help in debugging from connection tracker side.
              For example, through this "label" we can backtrack to the
              ACL rule which is causing a "leaked" connection.
              Connection tracker entries are created only for allowed
              connections so the label is valid only for allow and
              allow-related actions.

       <b>priority</b>: integer, in range 0 to 32,767
              The ACL rule’s priority. Rules with numerically higher
              priority take precedence over those with lower. If two ACL
              rules with the same priority both match, then the one
              actually applied to a packet is undefined.

              Return traffic from an <b>allow-related </b>flow is always
              allowed and cannot be changed through an ACL.

              <b>allow-stateless </b>flows always take precedence before
              stateful ACLs, regardless of their priority. (Both <b>allow</b>
              and <b>allow-related </b>ACLs can be stateful.)

       <b>direction</b>: string, either <b>from-lport </b>or <b>to-lport</b>
              Direction of the traffic to which this rule should apply:

              •      <b>from-lport</b>: Used to implement filters on traffic
                     arriving from a logical port. These rules are
                     applied to the logical switch’s ingress pipeline.

              •      <b>to-lport</b>: Used to implement filters on traffic
                     forwarded to a logical port. These rules are
                     applied to the logical switch’s egress pipeline.

       <b>match</b>: string
              The packets that the ACL should match, in the same
              expression language used for the <b>match </b>column in the OVN
              Southbound database’s <b>Logical_Flow </b>table. The <b>outport</b>
              logical port is only available in the <b>to-lport </b>direction
              (the <b>inport </b>is available in both directions).

              By default all traffic is allowed. When writing a more
              restrictive policy, it is important to remember to allow
              flows such as ARP and IPv6 neighbor discovery packets.

              Note that you can not create an ACL matching on a port
              with type=router or type=localnet.

       <b>action</b>: string, one of <b>allow-related</b>, <b>allow-stateless</b>, <b>allow</b>,
       <b>drop</b>, <b>pass</b>, or <b>reject</b>
              The action to take when the ACL rule matches:

              •      <b>allow-stateless</b>: Always forward the packet in
                     stateless manner, omitting connection tracking
                     mechanism, regardless of other rules defined for
                     the switch. May require defining additional rules
                     for inbound replies. For example, if you define a
                     rule to allow outgoing TCP traffic directed to an
                     IP address, then you probably also want to define
                     another rule to allow incoming TCP traffic coming
                     from this same IP address. In addition, traffic
                     that matches stateless ACLs will bypass load-
                     balancer DNAT/un-DNAT processing. Stateful ACLs
                     should be used instead if the traffic is supposed
                     to be load-balanced.

              •      <b>allow</b>: Forward the packet. It will also send the
                     packets through connection tracking when
                     <b>allow-related </b>rules exist on the logical switch.
                     Otherwise, it’s equivalent to <b>allow-stateless</b>.

              •      <b>allow-related</b>: Forward the packet and related
                     traffic (e.g. inbound replies to an outbound
                     connection).

              •      <b>drop</b>: Silently drop the packet.

              •      <b>reject</b>: Drop the packet, replying with a RST for
                     TCP or ICMPv4/ICMPv6 unreachable message for other
                     IPv4/IPv6-based protocols.

              •      <b>pass</b>: Pass to the next ACL tier. If using multiple
                     ACL tiers, a match on this ACL will stop evaluating
                     ACLs at the current tier and move to the next one.
                     If not using ACL tiers or if a <b>pass </b>ACL is matched
                     at the final tier, then the
                     <b>options:default_acl_drop </b>option from the <b>NB_Global</b>
                     table is used to determine how to proceed.

       <b>tier</b>: integer, in range 0 to 3
              The hierarchical tier that this ACL belongs to.

              ACLs can be assigned to numerical tiers. When evaluating
              ACLs, an internal counter is used to determine which tier
              of ACLs should be evaluated. Tier 0 ACLs are evaluated
              first. If no verdict can be determined, then tier 1 ACLs
              are evaluated next. This continues until the maximum tier
              value is reached. If all tiers of ACLs are evaluated and
              no verdict is reached, then the <b>options:default_acl_drop</b>
              option from table <b>NB_Global </b>is used to determine how to
              proceed.

              In this version of OVN, the maximum tier value for ACLs is
              3, meaning there are 4 tiers of ACLs allowed (0-3).

     <i>options:</i>

       ACLs options.

       <b>options : apply-after-lb</b>: optional string
              If set to true, the ACL will be applied after load
              balancing stage. Supported only for <b>from-lport </b>direction.

              The main use case of this option is to support ACLs
              matching on the destination IP address of the packet for
              the backend IPs of load balancers.

              <b>OVN </b>will apply the <b>from-lport </b>ACLs in two stages. ACLs
              without this option <b>apply-after-lb </b>set, will be applied
              before the load balancer stage and ACLs with this option
              set will be applied after the load balancer stage. The
              priorities are indepedent between these stages and may not
              be obvious to the CMS. Hence CMS should be extra careful
              when using this option and should carefully evaluate the
              priorities of all the ACLs and the default deny/allow ACLs
              if any.

     <i>Logging:</i>

       These columns control whether and how OVN logs packets that match
       an ACL.

       <b>log</b>: boolean
              If set to <b>true</b>, packets that match the ACL will trigger a
              log message on the transport node or nodes that perform
              ACL processing. Logging may be combined with any <b>action</b>.

              If set to <b>false</b>, the remaining columns in this group have
              no significance.

       <b>name</b>: optional string, at most 63 characters long
              This name, if it is provided, is included in log records.
              It provides the administrator and the cloud management
              system a way to associate a log record with a particular
              ACL.

       <b>severity</b>: optional string, one of <b>alert</b>, <b>debug</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>notice</b>, or
       <b>warning</b>
              The severity of the ACL. The severity levels match those
              of syslog, in decreasing level of severity: <b>alert</b>,
              <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>debug</b>. When the column is empty,
              the default is <b>info</b>.

       <b>meter</b>: optional string
              The name of a meter to rate-limit log messages for the
              ACL. The string must match the <b>name </b>column of a row in the
              <b>Meter </b>table. By default, log messages are not rate-
              limited. In order to ensure that the same <b>Meter </b>rate
              limits multiple ACL logs separately, set the <b>fair </b>column.

     <i>Common Columns:</i>

       <b>options</b>: map of string-string pairs
              This column provides general key/value settings. The
              supported options are described individually below.

     <i>ACL configuration options:</i>

       <b>options : log-related</b>: optional string
              If set to <b>true</b>, then log when reply or related traffic is
              admitted from a stateful ACL. In order for this option to
              function, the <b>log </b>option must be set to <b>true </b>and a <b>label</b>
              must be set, and it must be unique to the ACL. The label
              is necessary as it is the only means to associate the
              reply traffic with the ACL to which it belongs. It must be
              unique, because otherwise it is ambiguous which ACL will
              be matched. Note: If this option is enabled, an extra flow
              is installed in order to log the related traffic.
              Therefore, if this is enabled on all ACLs, then the total
              number of flows necessary to log the ACL traffic is
              doubled, compared to if this option is not enabled.

              enabled. If this column is set to <b>false</b>, the router is
              disabled. A disabled router has all ingress and egress
              traffic dropped.

       <b>nat</b>: set of <b>NAT</b>s
              One or more NAT rules for the router. NAT rules only work
              on Gateway routers, and on distributed routers with one
              and only one distributed gateway port.

       <b>load_balancer</b>: set of weak reference to <b>Load_Balancer</b>s
              Set of load balancers associated to this logical router.
              Load balancer Load balancer rules only work on the Gateway

     <i>Naming:</i>

       These columns provide names for the logical router. From OVN’s
       perspective, these names have no special meaning or purpose other
       than to provide convenience for human interaction with the
       northbound database. There is no requirement for the name to be
       unique. (For a unique identifier for a logical router, use its
       row UUID.)

       (Originally, <b>name </b>was intended to serve the purpose of a human-
       friendly name, but the Neutron integration used it to uniquely
       identify its own router object, in the format <b>neutron-</b><i>uuid</i>. Later
       on, Neutron started propagating the friendly name of a router as
       <b>external_ids:neutron:router_name</b>. Perhaps this can be cleaned up
       someday.)

       <b>name</b>: string
              A name for the logical router.

       <b>external_ids : neutron:router_name</b>: optional string
              Another name for the logical router.

       <b>copp</b>: optional weak reference to <b>Copp</b>
              The control plane protection policy from table <b>Copp </b>used
              for metering packets sent to <b>ovn-controller </b>from logical
              ports of this router.

     <i>Options:</i>

       Additional options for the logical router.

       <b>options : chassis</b>: optional string
              If set, indicates that the logical router in question is a
              Gateway router (which is centralized) and resides in the
              set chassis. The same value is also used by <b>ovn-controller</b>
              to uniquely identify the chassis in the OVN deployment and
              comes from <b>external_ids:system-id </b>in the <b>Open_vSwitch</b>
              table of Open_vSwitch database.

              The Gateway router can only be connected to a distributed
              router via a switch if SNAT and DNAT are to be configured
              in the Gateway router.

       <b>options : dnat_force_snat_ip</b>: optional string
              If set, indicates a set of IP addresses to use to force
              SNAT a packet that has already been DNATed in the gateway
              router. When multiple gateway routers are configured, a
              packet can potentially enter any of the gateway router,
              get DNATted and eventually reach the logical switch port.
              For the return traffic to go back to the same gateway
              router (for unDNATing), the packet needs a SNAT in the
              first place. This can be achieved by setting the above
              option with a gateway specific set of IP addresses. This
              option may have exactly one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address
              on it, separated by a a space.

       <b>options : lb_force_snat_ip</b>: optional string
              If set, this option can take two possible type of values.
              Either a set of IP addresses or the string value -
              <b>router_ip</b>.

              If a set of IP addresses are configured, it indicates to
              use to force SNAT a packet that has already been load-
              balanced in the gateway router. When multiple gateway
              routers are configured, a packet can potentially enter any
              of the gateway routers, get DNATted as part of the load-
              balancing and eventually reach the logical switch port.
              For the return traffic to go back to the same gateway
              router (for unDNATing), the packet needs a SNAT in the
              first place. This can be achieved by setting the above
              option with a gateway specific set of IP addresses. This
              option may have exactly one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address
              on it, separated by a space character.

              If it is configured with the value <b>router_ip</b>, then the
              load balanced packet is SNATed with the IP of router port
              (attached to the gateway router) selected as the
              destination after taking the routing decision.

       <b>options : mcast_relay</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Enables/disables IP multicast relay between logical
              switches connected to the logical router. Default: False.

       <b>options : dynamic_neigh_routers</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, the router will resolve neighbor routers’
              MAC addresses only by dynamic ARP/ND, instead of
              prepopulating static mappings for all neighbor routers in
              the ARP/ND Resolution stage. This reduces number of flows,
              but requires ARP/ND messages to resolve the IP-MAC
              bindings when needed. It is <b>false </b>by default. It is
              recommended to set to <b>true </b>when a large number of logical
              routers are connected to the same logical switch but most
              of them never need to send traffic between each other. By
              default, ovn-northd does not create mappings to NAT and
              load balancer addresess. However, for NAT and load
              balancer addresses that have the <b>add_route </b>option added,
              ovn-northd will create logical flows that map NAT and load
              balancer IP addresses to the appropriate MAC address.
              Setting <i>dynamic_neigh_routers</i> to <b>true </b>will prevent the
              automatic creation of these logical flows.

       <b>options : always_learn_from_arp_request</b>: optional string, either
       <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              This option controls the behavior when handling IPv4 ARP
              requests or IPv6 ND-NS packets - whether a dynamic
              neighbor (MAC binding) entry is added/updated.

              <b>true </b>- Always learn the MAC-IP binding, and add/update the
              MAC binding entry.

              <b>false </b>- If there is a MAC binding for that IP and the MAC
              is different, or, if TPA of ARP request belongs to any
              router port on this router, then update/add that MAC-IP
              binding. Otherwise, don’t update/add entries.

              It is <b>true </b>by default. It is recommended to set to <b>false</b>
              when a large number of logical routers are connected to
              the same logical switch but most of them never need to
              send traffic between each other, to reduce the size of the
              MAC binding table.

       <b>options : requested-tnl-key</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 16,777,215
              Configures the datapath tunnel key for the logical router.
              This is not needed because <b>ovn-northd </b>will assign an
              unique key for each datapath by itself. However, if it is
              configured, <b>ovn-northd </b>honors the configured value.

       <b>options : snat-ct-zone</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       in range 0 to 65,535
              Use the requested conntrack zone for SNAT with this
              router. This can be useful if egress traffic from the host
              running OVN comes from both OVN and other sources. This
              way, OVN and the other sources can make use of the same
              conntrack zone.

       <b>options : mac_binding_age_threshold</b>: optional string
              Specifies the MAC binding aging thresholds based on CIDRs,
              with the format: <i>entry</i>[<b>;</b><i>entry</i>[...]], where each <i>entry</i> has
              the format: [<i>cidr</i><b>:</b>]<i>threshold</i>

              •      <i>cidr</i>: Can be either an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR.

              •      <i>threshold</i>: Threshold value in seconds. MAC bindings
                     with IP addresses matching the specified CIDR that
                     exceed this timeout will be automatically removed.

              If an <i>entry</i> is provided without an CIDR (just the
              threshold value), it specifies the default threshold for
              MAC bindings that don’t match any of the given CIDRs. If
              there are multiple default threshold entries in the
              option, the behavior is undefined.

              If there are multiple CIDRs matching a MAC binding IP, the
              one with the longest prefix length takes effect. If there
              are multiple entries with the same CIDR in the option, the
              behavior is undefined.

              If no matching CIDR is found for a MAC binding IP, and no
              default threshold is specified, the behavior defaults to
              the original: the binding will not be removed based on
              age.

              The value can also default to an empty string, which means
              that the aging threshold is disabled. Any string not in
              the above format is regarded as invalid and the aging is
              disabled.

              Example:
              <b>192.168.0.0/16:300;192.168.10.0/24:0;fe80::/10:600;1200</b>

              This sets a threshold of 300 seconds for MAC bindings with
              IP addresses in the 192.168.0.0/16 range, excluding the
              192.168.1.0/24 range (for which the aging is disabled), a
              threshold of 600 seconds for MAC bindings with IP
              addresses in the fe80::/10 IPv6 range, and a default
              threshold of 1200 seconds for all other MAC bindings.

QoS TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Each row in this table represents one QoS rule for a logical
       switch that points to it through its <b>qos_rules </b>column. Two types
       of QoS are supported: DSCP marking and metering. A <b>match </b>with the
       highest-<b>priority </b>will have QoS applied to it. If the <b>action</b>
       column is specified, then matching packets will have DSCP marking
       applied. If the <b>bandwidth </b>column is specified, then matching
       packets will have metering applied. <b>action </b>and <b>bandwidth </b>are not
       exclusive, so both marking and metering by defined for the same
       QoS entry. If no row matches, packets will not have any QoS
       applied.

   <b>Summary:</b>

              The QoS rule’s priority. Rules with numerically higher
              priority take precedence over those with lower. If two QoS
              rules with the same priority both match, then the one
              actually applied to a packet is undefined.

       <b>direction</b>: string, either <b>from-lport </b>or <b>to-lport</b>
              The value of this field is similar to <b>ACL </b>column in the

       <b>bandwidth</b>: map of string-integer pairs, key either <b>burst </b>or <b>rate</b>,
       value in range 1 to 4,294,967,295
              When specified, matching packets will have bandwidth
              metering applied. Traffic over the limit will be dropped.

       <i>Status:</i>
         <b>status : hosting-chassis    </b>optional string

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>name</b>: string (must be unique within table)
              A name for the logical router port.

              In addition to provide convenience for human interaction
              with the northbound database, this column is used as
              reference by its patch port in <b>Logical_Switch_Port </b>or
              another logical router port in <b>Logical_Router_Port</b>.

              A logical router port may not have the same name as a
              logical switch port, but the database schema cannot
              enforce this.

       <b>networks</b>: set of 1 or more strings
              The IP addresses and netmasks of the router. For example,
              <b>192.168.0.1/24 </b>indicates that the router’s IP address is
              192.168.0.1 and that packets destined to 192.168.0.<i>x</i>
              should be routed to this port.

              A logical router port always adds a link-local IPv6
              address (fe80::/64) automatically generated from the
              interface’s MAC address using the modified EUI-64 format.

       <b>mac</b>: string
              The Ethernet address that belongs to this router port.

       <b>enabled</b>: optional boolean
              This column is used to administratively set port state. If
              this column is empty or is set to <b>true</b>, the port is
              enabled. If this column is set to <b>false</b>, the port is
              disabled. A disabled port has all ingress and egress
              traffic dropped.

       <b>dhcp_relay</b>: optional <b>DHCP_Relay</b>
              This column is used to enabled DHCP Relay. Please refer to
              <b>DHCP_Relay </b>table.

     <i>Distributed Gateway Ports:</i>

       Gateways, as documented under <b>Gateways </b>in the OVN architecture
       guide, provide limited connectivity between logical networks and
       physical ones. OVN support multiple kinds of gateways. The
       <b>Logical_Router_Port </b>table can be used two different ways to
       configure <i>distributed gateway ports</i>, which are one kind of
       gateway. These two forms of configuration exist for historical
       reasons. Both of them produce the same kind of OVN southbound
       records and the same behavior in practice.

       If either of these are set, this logical router port represents a
       distributed gateway port that connects this router to a logical
       switch with a <b>localnet </b>port or a connection to another OVN
       deployment.

       Also mentioned in the OVN architecture guide, distributed gateway
       ports can also be used for scalability reasons in deployments
       where logical switches are dedicated to chassises rather than
       distributed.

       The preferred way to configure a gateway is <b>ha_chassis_group</b>, but
       <b>gateway_chassis </b>is also supported for backward compatibility.
       Only one of these should be set at a time on a given LRP, since
       they configure the same features.

       Even when a gateway is configured, the logical router port still
       effectively resides on each chassis. However, due to the
       implications of the use of L2 learning in the physical network,
       as well as the need to support advanced features such as one-to-
       many NAT (aka IP masquerading), a subset of the logical router
       processing is handled in a centralized manner on the gateway
       chassis.

       There can be more than one distributed gateway ports configured
       on each logical router, each connecting to different L2 segments.
       Load-balancing is not yet supported on logical routers with more
       than one distributed gateway ports.

       For each distributed gateway port, it may have more than one
       gateway chassises. When more than one gateway chassis is
       specified, OVN only uses one at a time. OVN can rely on OVS BFD
       implementation to monitor gateway connectivity, preferring the
       highest-priority gateway that is online. Priorities are specified
       in the <b>priority </b>column of <b>Gateway_Chassis </b>or <b>HA_Chassis</b>.

       <b>ovn-northd </b>programs the <b>external_mac </b>rules specified in the LRP’s
       LR into the peer logical switch’s destination lookup on the
       chassis where the <b>logical_port </b>resides. In addition, the logical
       router’s MAC address is automatically programmed in the peer
       logical switch’s destination lookup flow on the gateway chasssis.
       If it is desired to generate gratuitous ARPs for NAT addresses,
       then set the peer LSP’s <b>options:nat-addresses </b>to <b>router</b>.

       OVN 20.03 and earlier supported a third way to configure
       distributed gateway ports using <b>options:redirect-chassis </b>to
       specify the gateway chassis. This method is no longer supported.
       Any remaining users should switch to one of the newer methods
       instead. A <b>gateway_chassis </b>may be easily configured from the
       command line, e.g. <b>ovn-nbctl lrp-set-gateway-chassis </b><i>lrp chassis</i>.

       <b>ha_chassis_group</b>: optional <b>HA_Chassis_Group</b>
              Designates an <b>HA_Chassis_Group </b>to provide gateway high
              availability.

       <b>gateway_chassis</b>: set of <b>Gateway_Chassis</b>es
              Designates one or more <b>Gateway_Chassis </b>for the logical
              router port.

     <i>Options for Physical VLAN MTU Issues:</i>

       MTU issues arise in mixing tunnels with logical networks that are
       bridged to a physical VLAN. For an explanation of the MTU issues,
       see <b>Physical VLAN MTU Issues </b>in the OVN architecture document.
       The following options, which are alternatives, provide solutions.
       Both of them cause packets to be sent over <b>localnet </b>instead of
       tunnels, but they differ in whether some or all packets are sent
       this way. The most prominent tradeoff between these options is
       that <b>reside-on-redirect-chassis </b>is easier to configure and that
       <b>redirect-type </b>performs better for east-west traffic.

       <b>options : reside-on-redirect-chassis</b>: optional string, either
       <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, this option forces all traffic across the
              logical router port to pass through the gateway chassis
              using a hop across a <b>localnet </b>port. This changes behavior
              in two ways:

              •      Without this option, east-west traffic passes
                     directly between source and destination chassis (or
                     even within a single chassis, for co-located VMs).
                     With this option, all east-west traffic passes
                     through the gateway chassis.

              •      Without this option, traffic between the gateway
                     chassis and other chassis is encapsulated in
                     tunnels. With this option, traffic passes over a
                     <b>localnet </b>interface.

              This option may usefully be set only on logical router
              ports that connect a distributed logical router to a
              logical switch with VIFs. It should not be set on a
              distributed gateway port.

              OVN honors this option only if the logical router has one
              and only one distributed gateway port and if the LRP’s
              peer switch has a <b>localnet </b>port.

       <b>options : redirect-type</b>: optional string, either <b>bridged </b>or
       <b>overlay</b>
              If set to <b>bridged </b>on a distributed gateway port, this
              option causes OVN to redirect packets to the gateway
              chassis over a <b>localnet </b>port instead of a tunnel. The
              relevant chassis must share a <b>localnet </b>port.

              This feature requires the administrator or the CMS to
              configure each participating chassis with a unique
              Ethernet address for the logical router by setting
              <b>ovn-chassis-mac-mappings </b>in the Open vSwitch database, for
              use by <b>ovn-controller</b>.

              Setting this option to <b>overlay </b>or leaving it unset has no
              effect. This option may usefully be set only on a
              distributed gateway port when there is one and only one
              distributed gateway port on the logical router. It is
              otherwise ignored.

       <b>ipv6_prefix</b>: set of strings
              This column contains IPv6 prefix obtained by prefix
              delegation router according to RFC 3633

     <i>ipv6_ra_configs:</i>

       This column defines the IPv6 ND RA address mode and ND MTU Option
       to be included by <b>ovn-controller </b>when it replies to the IPv6
       Router solicitation requests.

       <b>ipv6_ra_configs : address_mode</b>: optional string
              The address mode to be used for IPv6 address
              configuration. The supported values are:

              •      <b>slaac</b>: Address configuration using Router
                     Advertisement (RA) packet. The IPv6 prefixes
                     defined in the <b>Logical_Router_Port </b>table’s <b>networks</b>
                     column will be included in the RA’s ICMPv6 option -
                     Prefix information.

              •      <b>dhcpv6_stateful</b>: Address configuration using
                     DHCPv6.

              •      <b>dhcpv6_stateless</b>: Address configuration using
                     Router Advertisement (RA) packet. Other IPv6
                     options are provided by DHCPv6.

       <b>ipv6_ra_configs : router_preference</b>: optional string
              Default Router Preference (PRF) indicates whether to
              prefer this router over other default routers (RFC 4191).
              Possible values are:

              •      HIGH: mapped to 0x01 in RA PRF field

              •      MEDIUM: mapped to 0x00 in RA PRF field

              •      LOW: mapped to 0x11 in RA PRF field

       <b>ipv6_ra_configs : route_info</b>: optional string
              Route Info is used to configure Route Info Option sent in
              Router Advertisement according to RFC 4191. Route Info is
              a comma separated string where each field provides PRF and
              prefix for a given route (e.g: HIGH-aef1::11/48,LOW-
              aef2::11/96) Possible PRF values are:

              •      HIGH: mapped to 0x01 in RA PRF field

              •      MEDIUM: mapped to 0x00 in RA PRF field

              •      LOW: mapped to 0x11 in RA PRF field

       <b>ipv6_ra_configs : mtu</b>: optional string
              The recommended MTU for the link. Default is 0, which
              means no MTU Option will be included in RA packet replied
              by ovn-controller. Per RFC 2460, the mtu value is
              recommended no less than 1280, so any mtu value less than
              1280 will be considered as no MTU Option.

       <b>ipv6_ra_configs : send_periodic</b>: optional string
              If set to true, then this router interface will send
              router advertisements periodically. The default is false.

       <b>ipv6_ra_configs : max_interval</b>: optional string
              The maximum number of seconds to wait between sending
              periodic router advertisements. This option has no effect
              if <b>ipv6_ra_configs:send_periodic </b>is false. The default is
              600.

       <b>ipv6_ra_configs : min_interval</b>: optional string
              The minimum number of seconds to wait between sending
              periodic router advertisements. This option has no effect
              if <b>ipv6_ra_configs:send_periodic </b>is false. The default is
              one-third of <b>ipv6_ra_configs:max_interval</b>, i.e. 200
              seconds if that key is unset.

       <b>ipv6_ra_configs : rdnss</b>: optional string
              IPv6 address of RDNSS server announced in RA packets. At
              the moment OVN supports just one RDNSS server.

       <b>ipv6_ra_configs : dnssl</b>: optional string
              DNS Search List announced in RA packets. Multiple DNS
              Search List must be ’comma’ separated (e.g. "a.b.c,
              d.e.f")

     <i>Options:</i>

       Additional options for the logical router port.

       <b>options : mcast_flood</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, multicast traffic (including reports) are
              unconditionally forwarded to the specific port.

              This option applies when the port is part of a logical
              router which has <b>options</b>:mcast_relay set to <b>true</b>.

              Default: <b>false</b>.

       <b>options : requested-tnl-key</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 32,767
              Configures the port binding tunnel key for the port.
              Usually this is not needed because <b>ovn-northd </b>will assign
              an unique key for each port by itself. However, if it is
              configured, <b>ovn-northd </b>honors the configured value.

       <b>options : prefix_delegation</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, enable IPv6 prefix delegation state
              machine on this logical router port (RFC3633). IPv6 prefix
              delegation is available just on a gateway router or on a
              gateway router port.

       <b>options : prefix</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, this interface will receive an IPv6 prefix
              according to RFC3663

       <b>options : route_table</b>: optional string
              Designates lookup Logical_Router_Static_Routes with
              specified <b>route_table </b>value. Routes to directly connected
              networks from same Logical Router and routes without
              <b>route_table </b>option set have higher priority than routes
              with <b>route_table </b>option set.

       <b>options : gateway_mtu</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 68 to 65,535
              If set, logical flows will be added to router pipeline to
              check packet length. If packet length is greater than the
              value set, ICMPv4 type 3 (Destination Unreachable) code 4
              (Fragmentation Needed and Don’t Fragment was Set) or
              ICMPv6 type 2 (Packet Too Big) code 0 (no route to
              destination) packets will be generated. This allows for
              Path MTU Discovery.

       <b>options : gateway_mtu_bypass</b>: optional string
              When configured, represents a match expression, in the
              same expression language used for the <b>match </b>column in the
              OVN Southbound database’s <b>Logical_Flow </b>table. Packets
              matching this expression will bypass the length check
              configured through the <b>options:gateway_mtu </b>option.

     <i>Attachment:</i>

       A given router port serves one of two purposes:

              •      To attach a logical switch to a logical router. A
                     logical router port of this type is referenced by
                     exactly one <b>Logical_Switch_Port </b>of type <b>router</b>. The
                     value of <b>name </b>is set as <b>router-port </b>in column
                     <b>options </b>of <b>Logical_Switch_Port</b>. In this case <b>peer</b>

Logical_Router_Static_Route TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Each record represents a static route.

       When multiple routes match a packet, the longest-prefix match is
       chosen. For a given prefix length, a <b>dst-ip </b>route is preferred
       over a <b>src-ip </b>route.

       When there are ECMP routes, i.e. multiple routes with same prefix
       and policy, one of them will be selected based on the 5-tuple
       hashing of the packet header.

   <b>Summary:</b>

       <b>policy</b>: optional string, either <b>dst-ip </b>or <b>src-ip</b>
              If it is specified, this setting describes the policy used
              to make routing decisions. This setting must be one of the
              following strings:

              •      <b>src-ip</b>: This policy sends the packet to the <b>nexthop</b>
                     when the packet’s source IP address matches

              The name of the <b>Logical_Router_Port </b>via which the packet
              needs to be sent out. This is optional and when not
              specified, OVN will automatically figure this out based on

              IP addresses on the router port and none of them are in
              the same subnet of <b>nexthop</b>, OVN chooses the first IP

              Reference to <b>BFD </b>row if the route has associated a BFD
              session

       <b>route_table</b>: string
              Any string to place route to separate routing table. If
              Logical Router Port has configured value in

              •      1. First lookup among "global" routes: routes
                     without <b>route_table </b>value set and routes to

              <b>ovn-ic </b>populates this key if the route is learned from the
              global <b>OVN_IC_Southbound </b>database. In this case the value

              This column provides general key/value settings. The
              supported options are described individually below.

       <b>options : ecmp_symmetric_reply</b>: optional string
              If true, then new traffic that arrives over this route
              will have its reply traffic bypass ECMP route selection
              and will be sent out this route instead. Note that this
              option overrides any rules set in the
              <b>Logical_Router_policy </b>table. This option only works on
              gateway routers (routers that have <b>options:chassis </b>set).

       <b>priority</b>: integer, in range 0 to 32,767
              The routing policy’s priority. Rules with numerically
              higher priority take precedence over those with lower. A
              rule is uniquely identified by the priority and match

       <b>external_mac</b>: optional string
              A MAC address.

              This is only used on the gateway port on distributed
              routers. This must be specified in order for the NAT rule
              to be processed in a distributed manner on all chassis. If
              this is not specified for a NAT rule on a distributed

       <b>logical_port</b>: optional string
              The name of the logical port where the <b>logical_ip </b>resides.

       <b>allowed_ext_ips</b>: optional <b>Address_Set</b>
              It represents Address Set of external ips that NAT rule is
              applicable to. For SNAT type NAT rules, this refers to
              destination addresses. For DNAT type NAT rules, this
              refers to source addresses.

              This configuration overrides the default NAT behavior of
              applying a rule solely based on internal IP. Without this
              configuration, NAT happens without considering the
              external IP (i.e dest/source for snat/dnat type rule).
              With this configuration NAT rule is applied ONLY if
              external ip is in the input Address Set.

       <b>exempted_ext_ips</b>: optional <b>Address_Set</b>
              It represents Address Set of external ips that NAT rule is
              NOT applicable to. For SNAT type NAT rules, this refers to
              destination addresses. For DNAT type NAT rules, this
              refers to source addresses.

              This configuration overrides the default NAT behavior of
              applying a rule solely based on internal IP. Without this
              configuration, NAT happens without considering the
              external IP (i.e dest/source for snat/dnat type rule).
              With this configuration NAT rule is NOT applied if
              external ip is in the input Address Set.

              If there are NAT rules in a logical router with
              overlapping IP prefixes (including /32), then usage of
              <i>exempted_ext_ips</i> should be avoided in following scenario.
              a. SNAT rule (let us say RULE1) with logical_ip
              PREFIX/MASK (let us say 50.0.0.0/24). b. SNAT rule (let us
              say RULE2) with logical_ip PREFIX/MASK+1 (let us say
              50.0.0.0/25). c. Now, if exempted_ext_ips is associated
              with RULE2, then a logical ip which matches both
              50.0.0.0/24 and 50.0.0.0/25 may get the RULE2 applied to
              it instead of RULE1.

              <i>allowed_ext_ips</i> and <i>exempted_ext_ips</i> are mutually
              exclusive to each other. If both Address Sets are set for
              a rule, then the NAT rule is not considered.

       <b>gateway_port</b>: optional weak reference to <b>Logical_Router_Port</b>
              A distributed gateway port in the <b>Logical_Router_Port</b>
              table where the NAT rule needs to be applied.

              When multiple distributed gateway ports are configured on
              a <b>Logical_Router</b>, applying a NAT rule at each of the
              distributed gateway ports might not be desired. Consider
              the case where a logical router has 2 distributed gateway
              port, one with <b>networks 50.0.0.10/24 </b>and the other with
              <b>networks 60.0.0.10/24</b>. If the logical router has a NAT
              rule of <b>type snat</b>, <b>logical_ip 10.1.1.0/24 </b>and <b>external_ip</b>
              <b>50.1.1.20/24</b>, the rule needs to be selectively applied on
              matching packets entering/leaving through the distributed
              gateway port with <b>networks 50.0.0.10/24</b>.

              When a logical router has multiple distributed gateway
              ports and this column is not set for a NAT rule, then the
              rule will be applied at the distributed gateway port which
              is in the same network as the <b>external_ip </b>of the NAT rule,
              if such a router port exists. If logical router has a
              single distributed gateway port and this column is not set
              for a NAT rule, the rule will be applied at the
              distributed gateway port even if the router port is not in
              the same network as the <b>external_ip </b>of the NAT rule.

       <b>options : stateless</b>: optional string
              Indicates if a dnat_and_snat rule should lead to
              connection tracking state or not.

       <b>options : add_route</b>: optional string
              If set to <b>true</b>, then neighbor routers will have logical
              flows added that will allow for routing to the NAT
              address. It also will have ARP resolution logical flows
              added. By setting this option, it means there is no reason
              to create a <b>Logical_Router_Static_Route </b>from neighbor
              routers to this NAT address. It also means that no ARP
              request is required for neighbor routers to learn the IP-
              MAC mapping for this NAT address. This option only applies
              to NATs of type <b>dnat </b>and <b>dnat_and_snat</b>. For more
              information about what flows are added for IP routes,

       OVN implements native DHCPv4 support which caters to the common
       use case of providing an IPv4 address to a booting instance by
       providing stateless replies to DHCPv4 requests based on
       statically configured address mappings. To do this it allows a
       short list of DHCPv4 options to be configured and applied at each
       compute host running <b>ovn-controller</b>.

       OVN also implements native DHCPv6 support which provides
       stateless replies to DHCPv6 requests.

              This option specifies the OVN native DHCPv6 will work in
              stateless mode, which means OVN native DHCPv6 will not
              offer IPv6 addresses for VM/VIF ports, but only reply
              other configurations, such as DNS and domain search list.
              When setting this option with string value "true", VM/VIF
              will configure IPv6 addresses by stateless way. Default
              value for this option is false.

       <b>options : fqdn</b>: optional string
              The DHCPv6 option code for this option is 39. If set,
              indicates the DHCPv6 option "FQDN".

       <b>target</b>: string (must be unique within table)
              Connection methods for clients.

              The following connection methods are currently supported:

              <b>ssl:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified SSL <i>port</i> on the host at the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address. A valid SSL
                     configuration must be provided when this form is
                     used, this configuration can be specified via
                     command-line options or the <b>SSL </b>table.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not
                     always built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>tcp:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified TCP <i>port</i> on the host at the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address. If <i>host</i> is an
                     IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[::1]:6640</b>.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              <b>pssl:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for SSL connections on the specified TCP
                     <i>port</i>. Specify 0 for <i>port</i> to have the kernel
                     automatically choose an available port. If <i>host</i>,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address, is specified,
                     then connections are restricted to the resolved or
                     specified local IPaddress (either IPv4 or IPv6
                     address). If <i>host</i> is an IPv6 address, wrap in
                     square brackets, e.g. <b>pssl:6640:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is
                     not specified then it listens only on IPv4 (but not
                     IPv6) addresses. A valid SSL configuration must be
                     provided when this form is used, this can be
                     specified either via command-line options or the
                     <b>SSL </b>table.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not
                     always built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>ptcp:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for connections on the specified TCP <i>port</i>.
                     Specify 0 for <i>port</i> to have the kernel automatically
                     choose an available port. If <i>host</i>, which can either
                     be a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or an
                     IP address, is specified, then connections are
                     restricted to the resolved or specified local IP
                     address (either IPv4 or IPv6 address). If <i>host</i> is
                     an IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g.
                     <b>ptcp:6640:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is not specified then it
                     listens only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              When multiple clients are configured, the <b>target </b>values
              must be unique. Duplicate <b>target </b>values yield unspecified
              results.

     <i>Client Failure Detection and Handling:</i>

       <b>max_backoff</b>: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection
              attempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       <b>inactivity_probe</b>: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection
              to the client before sending an inactivity probe message.
              If Open vSwitch does not communicate with the client for
              the specified number of seconds, it will send a probe. If
              a response is not received for the same additional amount
              of time, Open vSwitch assumes the connection has been
              broken and attempts to reconnect. Default is
              implementation-specific. A value of 0 disables inactivity
              probes.

     <i>Status:</i>

       Key-value pair of <b>is_connected </b>is always updated. Other key-value
       pairs in the status columns may be updated depends on the <b>target</b>
       type.

       When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
       inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>punix:</b>), both <b>n_connections</b>
       and <b>is_connected </b>may also be updated while the remaining key-
       value pairs are omitted.

       On the other hand, when <b>target </b>specifies an outbound connection,
       all key-value pairs may be updated, except the above-mentioned
       two key-value pairs associated with inbound connection targets.
       They are omitted.

       <b>is_connected</b>: boolean
              <b>true </b>if currently connected to this client, <b>false</b>
              otherwise.

       <b>status : last_error</b>: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the
              connection to the manager; i.e. <b>strerror(errno)</b>. This key
              will exist only if an error has occurred.

       <b>status : state</b>: optional string, one of <b>ACTIVE</b>, <b>BACKOFF</b>,
       <b>CONNECTING</b>, <b>IDLE</b>, or <b>VOID</b>
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              <b>VOID   </b>Connection is disabled.

              <b>BACKOFF</b>
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              <b>CONNECTING</b>
                     Attempting to connect.

              <b>ACTIVE </b>Connected, remote host responsive.

              <b>IDLE   </b>Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-
                     alive.

              These values may change in the future. They are provided
              only for human consumption.

       <b>status : sec_since_connect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last successfully
              connected to the database (in seconds). Value is empty if
              client has never successfully been connected.

       <b>status : sec_since_disconnect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last disconnected
              from the database (in seconds). Value is empty if client
              has never disconnected.

       <b>status : locks_held</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection holds. Omitted if the connection does not hold
              any locks.

       <b>status : locks_waiting</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection is currently waiting to acquire. Omitted if the
              connection is not waiting for any locks.

       <b>status : locks_lost</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection has had stolen by another OVSDB client. Omitted
              if no locks have been stolen from this connection.

       <b>status : n_connections</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 2
              When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
              inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>) and more than
              one connection is actually active, the value is the number
              of active connections. Otherwise, this key-value pair is
              omitted.

       <b>status : bound_port</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              When <b>target </b>is <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>, this is the TCP port on
              which the OVSDB server is listening. (This is particularly
              useful when <b>target </b>specifies a port of 0, allowing the
              kernel to choose any available port.)

HA_Chassis_Group TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Table representing a group of chassis which can provide high
       availability services. Each chassis in the group is represented
       by the table <b>HA_Chassis</b>. The HA chassis with highest priority
       will be the active chassis of this group. If the active chassis
       failover is detected, the HA chassis with the next higher
       priority takes over the responsibility of providing the HA. If a
       distributed gateway router port references a row in this table,
       then the active HA chassis in this group provides the gateway
       functionality.

BFD TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Contains BFD parameter for ovn-controller BFD configuration. OVN
       BFD implementation is used to provide detection of failures in
       the path between adjacent forwarding engines, including the OVN
       interfaces. OVN BFD provides link status info to OVN northd in
       order to update logical flows according to the status of BFD
       endpoints. In the current implementation OVN BFD is used to check
       next-hop status for ECMP routes. Please note BFD table refers to
       OVN BFD implementation and not to OVS legacy one.

     <i>Configuration:</i>

       <b>ovn-northd </b>reads configuration from these columns.

       <b>logical_port</b>: string
              OVN logical port when BFD engine is running.

       <b>dst_ip</b>: string
              BFD peer IP address.

       <b>min_tx</b>: optional integer, at least 1
              This is the minimum interval, in milliseconds, that the
              local system would like to use when transmitting BFD
              Control packets, less any jitter applied. The value zero
              is reserved. Default value is 1000 ms.

       <b>min_rx</b>: optional integer
              This is the minimum interval, in milliseconds, between
              received BFD Control packets that this system is capable
              of supporting, less any jitter applied by the sender. If
              this value is zero, the transmitting system does not want
              the remote system to send any periodic BFD Control
              packets.

       <b>detect_mult</b>: optional integer, at least 1
              Detection time multiplier. The negotiated transmit
              interval, multiplied by this value, provides the Detection
              Time for the receiving system in Asynchronous mode.
              Default value is 5.

   <b>Details:</b>
     <i>Configuration:</i>

       <b>ovn-northd </b>reads configuration from these columns and propagates
       the value to SBDB.

       <b>logical_port</b>: string
              The logical router port for the binding.

       <b>ip</b>: string

              Override dynamically learnt MACs.
</pre> <h2>
Chassis_Template_Var TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       One record per chassis, each containing a map, <b>variables</b>, between
       template variable names and their value for that specific
       chassis. A template variable has a name and potentially different
       values on different hypervisors in the OVN cluster. For example,
       two rows, <b>R1 = (.chassis=C1, variables={(N: V1)} </b>and <b>R2 =</b>
       <b>(.chassis=C2, variables={(N: V2)} </b>will make <b>ovn-controller</b>
       running on chassis <b>C1 </b>and <b>C2 </b>interpret the token <b>N </b>either as <b>V1</b>
       (on <b>C1</b>) or as <b>V2 </b>(on <b>C2</b>). Users can refer to template variables
       from within other logical components, e.g., within ACL, QoS or
       Logical_Router_Policy matches or from Load_Balancer VIP and
       backend definitions.

       If a template variable is referenced on a chassis for which that
       variable is not defined then <b>ovn-controller </b>running on that
       chassis will just interpret it as a raw string literal.

   <b>Summary:</b>
       <b>chassis                       </b>string (must be unique within
                                     table)
