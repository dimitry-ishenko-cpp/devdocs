NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gitformat-chunk - Chunk-based file formats
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       Used by <a href="gitformat-commit-graph.5.html">gitformat-commit-graph(5)</a> and the "MIDX" format (see the
       pack format documentation in <a href="gitformat-pack.5.html">gitformat-pack(5)</a>).
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Some file formats in Git use a common concept of "chunks" to
       describe sections of the file. This allows structured access to a
       large file by scanning a small "table of contents" for the
       remaining data. This common format is used by the <b>commit-graph</b>
       and <b>multi-pack-index </b>files. See the <b>multi-pack-index </b>format in
       <a href="gitformat-pack.5.html">gitformat-pack(5)</a> and the <b>commit-graph </b>format in
       <a href="gitformat-commit-graph.5.html">gitformat-commit-graph(5)</a> for how they use the chunks to describe
       structured data.

       A chunk-based file format begins with some header information
       custom to that format. That header should include enough
       information to identify the file type, format version, and number
       of chunks in the file. From this information, that file can
       determine the start of the chunk-based region.

       The chunk-based region starts with a table of contents describing
       where each chunk starts and ends. This consists of (C+1) rows of
       12 bytes each, where C is the number of chunks. Consider the
       following table:

           | Chunk ID (4 bytes) | Chunk Offset (8 bytes) |
           |--------------------|------------------------|
           | ID[0]              | OFFSET[0]              |
           | ...                | ...                    |
           | ID[C]              | OFFSET[C]              |
           | 0x0000             | OFFSET[C+1]            |

       Each row consists of a 4-byte chunk identifier (ID) and an 8-byte
       offset. Each integer is stored in network-byte order.

       The chunk identifier <b>ID[i] </b>is a label for the data stored within
       this file from <b>OFFSET[i] </b>(inclusive) to <b>OFFSET[i+1] </b>(exclusive).
       Thus, the size of the <b>i`th chunk is equal to the difference</b>
       <b>between `OFFSET[i+1] </b>and <b>OFFSET[i]</b>. This requires that the chunk
       data appears contiguously in the same order as the table of
       contents.

       The final entry in the table of contents must be four zero bytes.
       This confirms that the table of contents is ending and provides
       the offset for the end of the chunk-based data.

       Note: The chunk-based format expects that the file contains <i>at</i>
       <i>least</i> a trailing hash after <b>OFFSET[C+1]</b>.

       Functions for working with chunk-based file formats are declared
       in <b>chunk-format.h</b>. Using these methods provide extra checks that
       assist developers when creating new file formats.
</pre> <h2>
WRITING CHUNK-BASED FILE FORMATS </h2>
<pre>
       To write a chunk-based file format, create a <b>struct chunkfile </b>by
       calling <b>init_chunkfile() </b>and pass a <b>struct hashfile </b>pointer. The
       caller is responsible for opening the <b>hashfile </b>and writing header
       information so the file format is identifiable before the
       chunk-based format begins.

       Then, call <b>add_chunk() </b>for each chunk that is intended for
       writing. This populates the <b>chunkfile </b>with information about the
       order and size of each chunk to write. Provide a <b>chunk_write_fn</b>
       function pointer to perform the write of the chunk data upon
       request.

       Call <b>write_chunkfile() </b>to write the table of contents to the
       <b>hashfile </b>followed by each of the chunks. This will verify that
       each chunk wrote the expected amount of data so the table of
       contents is correct.

       Finally, call <b>free_chunkfile() </b>to clear the <b>struct chunkfile</b>
       data. The caller is responsible for finalizing the <b>hashfile </b>by
       writing the trailing hash and closing the file.
</pre> <h2>
READING CHUNK-BASED FILE FORMATS </h2>
<pre>
       To read a chunk-based file format, the file must be opened as a
       memory-mapped region. The chunk-format API expects that the
       entire file is mapped as a contiguous memory region.

       Initialize a <b>struct chunkfile </b>pointer with <b>init_chunkfile(NULL)</b>.

       After reading the header information from the beginning of the
       file, including the chunk count, call <b>read_table_of_contents() </b>to
       populate the <b>struct chunkfile </b>with the list of chunks, their
       offsets, and their sizes.

       Extract the data information for each chunk using <b>pair_chunk() </b>or
       <b>read_chunk()</b>:

       •   <b>pair_chunk() </b>assigns a given pointer with the location inside
           the memory-mapped file corresponding to that chunk’s offset.
           If the chunk does not exist, then the pointer is not
           modified.

       •   <b>read_chunk() </b>takes a <b>chunk_read_fn </b>function pointer and calls
           it with the appropriate initial pointer and size information.
           The function is not called if the chunk does not exist. Use
           this method to read chunks if you need to perform immediate
           parsing or if you need to execute logic based on the size of
           the chunk.

       After calling these methods, call <b>free_chunkfile() </b>to clear the
       <b>struct chunkfile </b>data. This will not close the memory-mapped
       region. Callers are expected to own that data for the timeframe
       the pointers into the region are needed.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       These file formats use the chunk-format API, and can be used as
       examples for future formats:

       •   <b>commit-graph: </b>see <b>write_commit_graph_file() </b>and
           <b>parse_commit_graph() </b>in <b>commit-graph.c </b>for how the
           chunk-format API is used to write and parse the commit-graph
           file format documented in the commit-graph file format in
           <a href="gitformat-commit-graph.5.html">gitformat-commit-graph(5)</a>.

       •   <b>multi-pack-index: </b>see <b>write_midx_internal() </b>and
           <b>load_multi_pack_index() </b>in <b>midx.c </b>for how the chunk-format
           API is used to write and parse the multi-pack-index file
           format documented in the multi-pack-index file format section
           of <a href="gitformat-pack.5.html">gitformat-pack(5)</a>.
