DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/loadavg</i>
              The first three fields in this file are load average
              figures giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state
              R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5,
              and 15 minutes.  They are the same as the load average
              numbers given by <a href="../man1/uptime.1.html">uptime(1)</a> and other programs.  The fourth
              field consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/).
              The first of these is the number of currently runnable
              kernel scheduling entities (processes, threads).  The
              value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling
              entities that currently exist on the system.  The fifth
              field is the PID of the process that was most recently
              created on the system.
