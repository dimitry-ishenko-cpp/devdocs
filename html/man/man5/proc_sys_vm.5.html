DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/sys/vm/</i>
              This directory contains files for memory management
              tuning, buffer, and cache management.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes</i> (since Linux 3.10)
              This file defines the amount of free memory (in KiB) on
              the system that should be reserved for users with the
              capability <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>.

              The default value in this file is the minimum of [3% of
              free pages, 8MiB] expressed as KiB.  The default is
              intended to provide enough for the superuser to log in and
              kill a process, if necessary, under the default overcommit
              'guess' mode (i.e., 0 in <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>).

              Systems running in "overcommit never" mode (i.e., 2 in
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>) should increase the value
              in this file to account for the full virtual memory size
              of the programs used to recover (e.g., <a href="../man1/login.1.html">login(1)</a> <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh(1)</a>,
              and <a href="../man1/top.1.html">top(1)</a>) Otherwise, the superuser may not be able to
              log in to recover the system.  For example, on x86-64 a
              suitable value is 131072 (128MiB reserved).

              Changing the value in this file takes effect whenever an
              application requests memory.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/compact_memory</i> (since Linux 2.6.35)
              When 1 is written to this file, all zones are compacted
              such that free memory is available in contiguous blocks
              where possible.  The effect of this action can be seen by
              examining <i>/proc/buddyinfo</i>.

              Present only if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_COMPACTION</b>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</i> (since Linux 2.6.16)
              Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean
              caches, dentries, and inodes from memory, causing that
              memory to become free.  This can be useful for memory
              management testing and performing reproducible filesystem
              benchmarks.  Because writing to this file causes the
              benefits of caching to be lost, it can degrade overall
              system performance.

              To free pagecache, use:

                  echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

              To free dentries and inodes, use:

                  echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

              To free pagecache, dentries, and inodes, use:

                  echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

              Because writing to this file is a nondestructive operation
              and dirty objects are not freeable, the user should run
              <a href="../man1/sync.1.html">sync(1)</a> first.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/sysctl_hugetlb_shm_group</i> (since Linux 2.6.7)
              This writable file contains a group ID that is allowed to
              allocate memory using huge pages.  If a process has a
              filesystem group ID or any supplementary group ID that
              matches this group ID, then it can make huge-page
              allocations without holding the <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK </b>capability;
              see <a href="../man2/memfd_create.2.html">memfd_create(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>, and <a href="../man2/shmget.2.html">shmget(2)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/legacy_va_layout</i> (since Linux 2.6.9)
              If nonzero, this disables the new 32-bit memory-mapping
              layout; the kernel will use the legacy (2.4) layout for
              all processes.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill</i> (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Control how to kill processes when an uncorrected memory
              error (typically a 2-bit error in a memory module) that
              cannot be handled by the kernel is detected in the
              background by hardware.  In some cases (like the page
              still having a valid copy on disk), the kernel will handle
              the failure transparently without affecting any
              applications.  But if there is no other up-to-date copy of
              the data, it will kill processes to prevent any data
              corruptions from propagating.

              The file has one of the following values:

              <b>1      </b>Kill all processes that have the corrupted-and-not-
                     reloadable page mapped as soon as the corruption is
                     detected.  Note that this is not supported for a
                     few types of pages, such as kernel internally
                     allocated data or the swap cache, but works for the
                     majority of user pages.

              <b>0      </b>Unmap the corrupted page from all processes and
                     kill a process only if it tries to access the page.

              The kill is performed using a <b>SIGBUS </b>signal with <i>si_code</i>
              set to <b>BUS_MCEERR_AO</b>.  Processes can handle this if they
              want to; see <a href="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2)</a> for more details.

              This feature is active only on architectures/platforms
              with advanced machine check handling and depends on the
              hardware capabilities.

              Applications can override the <i>memory_failure_early_kill</i>
              setting individually with the <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_MCE_KILL</b>
              operation.

              Present only if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_recovery</i> (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Enable memory failure recovery (when supported by the
              platform).

              <b>1      </b>Attempt recovery.

              <b>0      </b>Always panic on a memory failure.

              Present only if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks</i> (since Linux 2.6.25)
              Enables a system-wide task dump (excluding kernel threads)
              to be produced when the kernel performs an OOM-killing.
              The dump includes the following information for each task
              (thread, process): thread ID, real user ID, thread group
              ID (process ID), virtual memory size, resident set size,
              the CPU that the task is scheduled on, oom_adj score (see
              the description of <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_adj</i>), and command name.
              This is helpful to determine why the OOM-killer was
              invoked and to identify the rogue task that caused it.

              If this contains the value zero, this information is
              suppressed.  On very large systems with thousands of
              tasks, it may not be feasible to dump the memory state
              information for each one.  Such systems should not be
              forced to incur a performance penalty in OOM situations
              when the information may not be desired.

              If this is set to nonzero, this information is shown
              whenever the OOM-killer actually kills a memory-hogging
              task.

              The default value is 0.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task</i> (since Linux 2.6.24)
              This enables or disables killing the OOM-triggering task
              in out-of-memory situations.

              If this is set to zero, the OOM-killer will scan through
              the entire tasklist and select a task based on heuristics
              to kill.  This normally selects a rogue memory-hogging
              task that frees up a large amount of memory when killed.

              If this is set to nonzero, the OOM-killer simply kills the
              task that triggered the out-of-memory condition.  This
              avoids a possibly expensive tasklist scan.

              If <i>/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom</i> is nonzero, it takes
              precedence over whatever value is used in
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task</i>.

              The default value is 0.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes</i> (since Linux 3.14)
              This writable file provides an alternative to
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</i> for controlling the
              <i>CommitLimit</i> when <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> has the
              value 2.  It allows the amount of memory overcommitting to
              be specified as an absolute value (in kB), rather than as
              a percentage, as is done with <i>overcommit_ratio</i>.  This
              allows for finer-grained control of <i>CommitLimit</i> on systems
              with extremely large memory sizes.

              Only one of <i>overcommit_kbytes</i> or <i>overcommit_ratio</i> can have
              an effect: if <i>overcommit_kbytes</i> has a nonzero value, then
              it is used to calculate <i>CommitLimit</i>, otherwise
              <i>overcommit_ratio</i> is used.  Writing a value to either of
              these files causes the value in the other file to be set
              to zero.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>
              This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting
              mode.  Values are:

                     0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
                     1: always overcommit, never check
                     2: always check, never overcommit

              In mode 0, calls of <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> with <b>MAP_NORESERVE </b>are not
              checked, and the default check is very weak, leading to
              the risk of getting a process "OOM-killed".

              In mode 1, the kernel pretends there is always enough
              memory, until memory actually runs out.  One use case for
              this mode is scientific computing applications that employ
              large sparse arrays.  Before Linux 2.6.0, any nonzero
              value implies mode 1.

              In mode 2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual
              address space that can be allocated (<i>CommitLimit</i> in
              <i>/proc/meminfo</i>) is calculated as

                  CommitLimit = (total_RAM - total_huge_TLB) *
                             overcommit_ratio / 100 + total_swap

              where:

              •  <i>total_RAM</i> is the total amount of RAM on the system;

              •  <i>total_huge_TLB</i> is the amount of memory set aside for
                 huge pages;

              •  <i>overcommit_ratio</i> is the value in
                 <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</i>; and

              •  <i>total_swap</i> is the amount of swap space.

              For example, on a system with 16 GB of physical RAM, 16 GB
              of swap, no space dedicated to huge pages, and an
              <i>overcommit_ratio</i> of 50, this formula yields a <i>CommitLimit</i>
              of 24 GB.

              Since Linux 3.14, if the value in
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes</i> is nonzero, then
              <i>CommitLimit</i> is instead calculated as:

                  CommitLimit = overcommit_kbytes + total_swap

              See also the description of
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes</i> and
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/user_reserve_kbytes</i>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This writable file defines a percentage by which memory
              can be overcommitted.  The default value in the file is
              50.  See the description of
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom</i> (since Linux 2.6.18)
              This enables or disables a kernel panic in an out-of-
              memory situation.

              If this file is set to the value 0, the kernel's OOM-
              killer will kill some rogue process.  Usually, the OOM-
              killer is able to kill a rogue process and the system will
              survive.

              If this file is set to the value 1, then the kernel
              normally panics when out-of-memory happens.  However, if a
              process limits allocations to certain nodes using memory
              policies (<a href="../man2/mbind.2.html">mbind(2)</a> <b>MPOL_BIND</b>) or cpusets (<a href="../man7/cpuset.7.html">cpuset(7)</a>) and
              those nodes reach memory exhaustion status, one process
              may be killed by the OOM-killer.  No panic occurs in this
              case: because other nodes' memory may be free, this means
              the system as a whole may not have reached an out-of-
              memory situation yet.

              If this file is set to the value 2, the kernel always
              panics when an out-of-memory condition occurs.

              The default value is 0.  1 and 2 are for failover of
              clustering.  Select either according to your policy of
              failover.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/swappiness</i>
              The value in this file controls how aggressively the
              kernel will swap memory pages.  Higher values increase
              aggressiveness, lower values decrease aggressiveness.  The
              default value is 60.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/user_reserve_kbytes</i> (since Linux 3.10)
              Specifies an amount of memory (in KiB) to reserve for user
              processes.  This is intended to prevent a user from
              starting a single memory hogging process, such that they
              cannot recover (kill the hog).  The value in this file has
              an effect only when <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> is set
              to 2 ("overcommit never" mode).  In this case, the system
              reserves an amount of memory that is the minimum of [3% of
              current process size, <i>user_reserve_kbytes</i>].

              The default value in this file is the minimum of [3% of
              free pages, 128MiB] expressed as KiB.

              If the value in this file is set to zero, then a user will
              be allowed to allocate all free memory with a single
              process (minus the amount reserved by
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes</i>).  Any subsequent
              attempts to execute a command will result in "fork: Cannot
              allocate memory".

              Changing the value in this file takes effect whenever an
              application requests memory.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/unprivileged_userfaultfd</i> (since Linux 5.2)
              This (writable) file exposes a flag that controls whether
              unprivileged processes are allowed to employ
              <a href="../man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd(2)</a>.  If this file has the value 1, then
              unprivileged processes may use <a href="../man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd(2)</a>.  If this
              file has the value 0, then only processes that have the
              <b>CAP_SYS_PTRACE </b>capability may employ <a href="../man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd(2)</a>.  The
              default value in this file is 1.
