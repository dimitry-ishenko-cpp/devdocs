NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lloadd.conf - configuration file for lloadd, the stand-alone LDAP
       daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/lloadd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The file <b>ETCDIR/lloadd.conf </b>contains configuration information
       for the <a href="../man8/lloadd.8.html">lloadd(8)</a><b>daemon.</b>

       The <b>lloadd.conf </b>file consists of a series of global configuration
       options that apply to <b>lloadd </b>as a whole (including all backends),
       followed by zero or more backend definitions that contain
       information specific how a backend instance should be contacted.
       The configuration options are case-insensitive; their value, on a
       case by case basis, may be case-sensitive.

       The general format of <b>lloadd.conf </b>is as follows:

           # comment - these options apply to the server as a whole
           &lt;global configuration options&gt;
           # first backend definition
           backend-server &lt;backend 1 definition&gt;
           # subsequent backend definitions
           ...

       As many backend servers may be configured as desired.

       If a line begins with white space, it is considered a
       continuation of the previous line.  No physical line should be
       over 2000 bytes long.

       Blank lines and comment lines beginning with a `#' character are
       ignored.  Note: continuation lines are unwrapped before comment
       processing is applied.

       Arguments on configuration lines are separated by white space. If
       an argument contains white space, the argument should be enclosed
       in double quotes.  If an argument contains a double quote (`"')
       or a backslash character (`\'), the character should be preceded
       by a backslash character.

       The specific configuration options available are discussed below
       in the Global Configuration Options and General Backend Options.
       Refer to the "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for more details on
       the lloadd configuration file.
</pre> <h2>
SLAPD INTEGRATION </h2>
<pre>
       Note that when <b>lloadd </b>is configured as a <b>slapd </b>module, any option
       that shares the same name as an option in <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a>, the
       <b>slapd </b>interpretation wins and the <b>lloadd </b>option mentioned is
       unavailable through <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> directly, instead, it would
       have to be configured via a dedicated attribute in cn=config. In
       particular, unless the <b>TLSShareSlapdCTX </b>option is set, <b>lloadd</b>
       keeps its own TLS context which cannot be configured except
       through the dynamic configuration.

       An additional option is available when running as a <b>slapd </b>module:

       <b>listen &lt;listen URIs&gt;</b>
              The URIs the Load Balancer module should listen on. Must
              not overlap with the ones that <b>slapd </b>uses for its own
              listening sockets. The related <b>cn=config </b>attribute is
              <b>olcBkLloadListen </b>with each URI provided as a separate
              value. No changes to this attribute made after the server
              has started up will take effect until it is restarted.
</pre> <h2>
GLOBAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Options described in this section apply to all backends.
       Arguments that should be replaced by actual text are shown in
       brackets &lt;&gt;.

       <b>argsfile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              The (absolute) name of a file that will hold the <b>lloadd</b>
              server's command line (program name and options).

       <b>concurrency &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify a desired level of concurrency.  Provided to the
              underlying thread system as a hint.  The default is not to
              provide any hint.

       <b>feature &lt;feature&gt; [...]</b>
              Switch additional features supported by the LDAP Load
              Balancer on.  Supported features are:
                     <b>proxyauthz</b>
                            when proxying an operation, pass the
                            client's authorized identity using the proxy
                            authorization control (RFC 4370). No control
                            is added to the operation if initiated by a
                            client whose bound identity matches the
                            identity configured in <b>bindconf </b>(no
                            normalisation of the DN is attempted).

                            If SASL binds are issued by clients and this
                            feature is enabled, backend servers need to
                            support LDAP Who Am I? extended operation
                            for the Load Balancer to detect the correct
                            authorization identity.

       <b>include &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Read additional configuration information from the given
              file before continuing with the next line of the current
              file.

       <b>io-threads &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the number of threads to use for the connection
              manager.  The default is 1 and this is typically adequate
              for up to 16 CPU cores.  The value should be set to a
              power of 2.

              If modified after server starts up, a change to this
              option will not take effect until the server has been
              restarted.

       <b>logfile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specify a file for recording lloadd debug messages. By
              default these messages only go to stderr, are not recorded
              anywhere else, and are unrelated to messages exposed by
              the

       <b>logfile-format debug | syslog-utc | syslog-localtime</b>
              Specify the prefix format for messages written to the
              logfile. The debug format is the normal format used for
              slapd debug messages, with a timestamp in hexadecimal,
              followed by a thread ID.  The other options are to use
              syslog(3) style prefixes, with timestamps either in UTC or
              in the local timezone. The default is debug format.
              <b>loglevel </b>configuration parameter. Specifying a logfile
              copies messages to both stderr and the logfile.

       <b>logfile-only on | off</b>
              Specify that debug messages should only go to the
              configured logfile, and not to stderr.

       <b>logfile-rotate &lt;max&gt; &lt;Mbytes&gt; &lt;hours&gt;</b>
              Specify automatic rotation for the configured logfile as
              the maximum number of old logfiles to retain, a maximum
              size in megabytes to allow a logfile to grow before
              rotation, and a maximum age in hours for a logfile to be
              used before rotation. The maximum number must be in the
              range 1-99.  Setting Mbytes or hours to zero disables the
              size or age check, respectively.  At least one of Mbytes
              or hours must be non-zero. By default no automatic
              rotation will be performed.

       <b>loglevel &lt;integer&gt; [...]</b>
              Specify the level at which debugging statements and
              operation statistics should be syslogged (currently logged
              to the <b>syslogd</b>(8) LOG_LOCAL4 facility).  They must be
              considered subsystems rather than increasingly verbose log
              levels.  Some messages with higher priority are logged
              regardless of the configured loglevel as soon as any
              logging is configured.  Log levels are additive, and
              available levels are:
                     <b>1      (0x1 trace) </b>trace function calls
                     <b>2      (0x2 packets) </b>debug packet handling
                     <b>4      (0x4 args) </b>heavy trace debugging (function
                            args)
                     <b>8      (0x8 conns) </b>connection management
                     <b>16     (0x10 BER) </b>print out packets sent and
                            received
                     <b>64     (0x40 config) </b>configuration file processing
                     <b>256    (0x100 stats) </b>connections, LDAP operations,
                            results (recommended)
                     <b>512    (0x200 stats2) </b>stats log entries sent

                     <b>32768  (0x8000 none) </b>only messages that get logged
                            whatever log level is set
              The desired log level can be input as a single integer
              that combines the (ORed) desired levels, both in decimal
              or in hexadecimal notation, as a list of integers (that
              are ORed internally), or as a list of the names that are
              shown between parentheses, such that

                  loglevel 513
                  loglevel 0x201
                  loglevel 512 1
                  loglevel 0x200 0x1
                  loglevel stats trace

              are equivalent.  The keyword <b>any </b>can be used as a shortcut
              to enable logging at all levels (equivalent to -1).  The
              keyword <b>none</b>, or the equivalent integer representation,
              causes those messages that are logged regardless of the
              configured loglevel to be logged.  In fact, if loglevel is
              set to 0, no logging occurs, so at least the <b>none </b>level is
              required to have high priority messages logged.

              The loglevel defaults to <b>stats</b>.  This level should usually
              also be included when using other loglevels, to help
              analyze the logs.

       <b>pidfile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              The (absolute) name of a file that will hold the <b>lloadd</b>
              server's process ID (see <a href="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid(2)</a>).

       <b>sockbuf_max_incoming_client &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum LDAP PDU size accepted coming from
              clients.  The default is 262143.

       <b>sockbuf_max_incoming_upstream &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum LDAP PDU size accepted coming from
              upstream connections.  The default is 4194303.

       <b>tcp-buffer [listener=&lt;URL&gt;] [{read|write}=]&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Specify the size of the TCP buffer.  A global value for
              both read and write TCP buffers related to any listener is
              defined, unless the listener is explicitly specified, or
              either the read or write qualifiers are used.  See <a href="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp(7)</a>
              for details.  Note that some OS-es implement automatic TCP
              buffer tuning.

       <b>threads &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum size of the primary thread pool.  The
              default is 16; the minimum value is 2.

       <b>threadqueues &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the number of work queues to use for the primary
              thread pool.  The default is 1 and this is typically
              adequate for up to 8 CPU cores.  The value should not
              exceed the number of CPUs in the system.

       <b>max_pdus_per_cycle &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              If set to 0, PDUs are handled by the I/O threads directly,
              otherwise a task is queued to be picked up by the thread
              pool. This task will process PDUs from the connection
              until there is no more data to be read or this limit is
              reached when the I/O thread can pick it up again.  Very
              high values have a potential to cause some connections to
              be starved in a very high-bandwidth environment. The
              default is 1000.

       <b>client_max_pending &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Will cause the load balancer to limit the number
              unfinished operations for each client connection. The
              default is 0, unlimited.

       <b>iotimeout &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the number of milliseconds to wait before forcibly
              closing a connection with an outstanding write. This
              allows faster recovery from various network hang
              conditions.  An iotimeout of 0 disables this feature.  The
              default is 10000.

       <b>write_coherence &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the number of seconds after a write operation is
              finished that <b>lloadd </b>will direct operations exclusively to
              the last selected backend. A write operation is anything
              not handled internally (certain exops, abandon), except
              search, compare and bind operations. Bind operations also
              reset this restriction. The default is 0, write operations
              do not restrict selection. When negative, the restriction
              is not time limited and will persist until the next bind.

       <b>restrict_exop &lt;OID&gt; &lt;action&gt;</b>
              Tell <b>lloadd </b>that extended operation with a given OID
              should be handled in a specific way.  OID <b>1.1 </b>is special,
              setting a default (only for operations not handled
              internally).  The meaning of the <b>&lt;action&gt; </b>argument is the
              same as in <b>restrict_control </b>below.

       <b>restrict_control &lt;OID&gt; &lt;action&gt;</b>
              Tell <b>lloadd </b>that a control with a given OID attached to
              any operation should be handled in a specific way
              according to the <b>&lt;action&gt; </b>argument. At the moment, only
              operations passed intact are inspected in this way, in
              particular, controls on bind and extended operations are
              <b>not </b>checked.

              In order of descending priority (the control with highest
              priority action wins), this is the action made:
                     <b>reject </b>operations that carry this control will be
                            rejected.
                     <b>connection</b>
                            once an upstream is selected, every future
                            operation from this client will be directed
                            to the same connection. Useful when state is
                            shared between client and upstream that the
                            load balancer doesn't track.
                     <b>backend</b>
                            like <b>write </b>except this does not time out.
                     <b>write  </b>this is treated like a write operation (see
                            <b>write_coherence</b>) above.
                     <b>ignore </b>does not influence restrictions, useful when
                            changing the global exop default.  This is
                            the default handling for exops/controls not
                            handled by the load balancer internally.
</pre> <h2>
TLS OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       If <b>lloadd </b>is built with support for Transport Layer Security,
       there are more options you can specify.

       <b>TLSShareSlapdCTX { on | off }</b>
              If set to no (the default), <b>lloadd </b>will use its own TLS
              context (needs to be configured via <b>cn=config </b>unless
              <b>lloadd </b>is run as a standalone daemon). If enabled, the
              options for <b>slapd </b>apply instead, since the <b>slapd</b>'s TLS
              context is used then.

       The following options are available only when compiled as a
       standalone daemon.  When compiled as a <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> module, the
       cn=config equivalents need to be used if a separate TLS context
       for the module is needed, otherwise use the <b>TLSShareSlapdCTX</b>
       option.

       <b>TLSCipherSuite &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt;</b>
              Permits configuring what ciphers will be accepted and the
              preference order.  &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt; should be a cipher
              specification for the TLS library in use (OpenSSL, GnuTLS,
              or Mozilla NSS).  This directive is not supported when
              using MbedTLS.  Example:

                     <i>OpenSSL:</i>
                            TLSCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2

                     <i>GnuTLS:</i>
                            TLSCiphersuite SECURE256:!AES-128-CBC

              To check what ciphers a given spec selects in OpenSSL,
              use:

                   openssl ciphers -v &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt;

              With GnuTLS the available specs can be found in the manual
              page of <a href="../man1/gnutls-cli.1.html">gnutls-cli(1)</a> (see the description of the option
              <b>--priority</b>).

              In older versions of GnuTLS, where gnutls-cli does not
              support the option --priority, you can obtain the — more
              limited — list of ciphers by calling:

                   gnutls-cli -l

              When using Mozilla NSS, the OpenSSL cipher suite
              specifications are used and translated into the format
              used internally by Mozilla NSS.  There isn't an easy way
              to list the cipher suites from the command line.  The
              authoritative list is in the source code for Mozilla NSS
              in the file sslinfo.c in the structure
                      static const SSLCipherSuiteInfo suiteInfo[]

       <b>TLSCACertificateFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specifies the file that contains certificates for all of
              the Certificate Authorities that <b>lloadd </b>will recognize.
              The certificate for the CA that signed the server
              certificate must be included among these certificates. If
              the signing CA was not a top-level (root) CA, certificates
              for the entire sequence of CA's from the signing CA to the
              top-level CA should be present. Multiple certificates are
              simply appended to the file; the order is not significant.

       <b>TLSCACertificatePath &lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specifies the path of a directory that contains
              Certificate Authority certificates in separate individual
              files. Usually only one of this or the
              TLSCACertificateFile is used. This directive is not
              supported when using GnuTLS.

              When using Mozilla NSS, &lt;path&gt; may contain a Mozilla NSS
              cert/key database.  If &lt;path&gt; contains a Mozilla NSS
              cert/key database and CA cert files, OpenLDAP will use the
              cert/key database and will ignore the CA cert files.

       <b>TLSCertificateFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specifies the file that contains the <b>lloadd </b>server
              certificate.

              When using Mozilla NSS, if using a cert/key database
              (specified with TLSCACertificatePath), TLSCertificateFile
              specifies the name of the certificate to use:
                   TLSCertificateFile Server-Cert
              If using a token other than the internal built in token,
              specify the token name first, followed by a colon:
                   TLSCertificateFile my hardware device:Server-Cert
              Use certutil -L to list the certificates by name:
                   certutil -d /path/to/certdbdir -L

       <b>TLSCertificateKeyFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specifies the file that contains the <b>lloadd </b>server private
              key that matches the certificate stored in the
              <b>TLSCertificateFile </b>file.  Currently, the private key must
              not be protected with a password, so it is of critical
              importance that it is protected carefully.

              When using Mozilla NSS, TLSCertificateKeyFile specifies
              the name of a file that contains the password for the key
              for the certificate specified with TLSCertificateFile.
              The modutil command can be used to turn off password
              protection for the cert/key database.  For example, if
              TLSCACertificatePath specifies /etc/openldap/certdb as the
              location of the cert/key database, use modutil to change
              the password to the empty string:
                   modutil -dbdir /etc/openldap/certdb -changepw 'NSS Certificate DB'
              You must have the old password, if any.  Ignore the
              WARNING about the running browser.  Press 'Enter' for the
              new password.

       <b>TLSDHParamFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              This directive specifies the file that contains parameters
              for Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange.  This is
              required in order to use a DSA certificate on the server,
              or an RSA certificate missing the "key encipherment" key
              usage.  Note that setting this option may also enable
              Anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchanges in certain non-
              default cipher suites.  Anonymous key exchanges should
              generally be avoided since they provide no actual client
              or server authentication and provide no protection against
              man-in-the-middle attacks.  You should append "!ADH" to
              your cipher suites to ensure that these suites are not
              used.  When using Mozilla NSS these parameters are always
              generated randomly so this directive is ignored.  This
              directive is not supported when using MbedTLS.

       <b>TLSECName &lt;name&gt;</b>
              Specify the name of a curve to use for Elliptic curve
              Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange.  This is required
              to enable ECDHE algorithms in OpenSSL.  This option is not
              used with GnuTLS; the curves may be chosen in the GnuTLS
              ciphersuite specification. This option is also ignored for
              Mozilla NSS.

       <b>TLSProtocolMin &lt;major&gt;[.&lt;minor&gt;]</b>
              Specifies minimum SSL/TLS protocol version that will be
              negotiated.  If the server doesn't support at least that
              version, the SSL handshake will fail.  To require TLS 1.x
              or higher, set this option to 3.(x+1), e.g.,

                   TLSProtocolMin 3.2

              would require TLS 1.1.  Specifying a minimum that is
              higher than that supported by the OpenLDAP implementation
              will result in it requiring the highest level that it does
              support.  This directive is ignored with GnuTLS.

       <b>TLSRandFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specifies the file to obtain random bits from when
              /dev/[u]random is not available.  Generally set to the
              name of the EGD/PRNGD socket.  The environment variable
              RANDFILE can also be used to specify the filename.  This
              directive is ignored with GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.

       <b>TLSVerifyClient &lt;level&gt;</b>
              Specifies what checks to perform on client certificates in
              an incoming TLS session, if any.  The <b>&lt;level&gt; </b>can be
              specified as one of the following keywords:

              <b>never  </b>This is the default.  <b>lloadd </b>will not ask the
                     client for a certificate.

              <b>allow  </b>The client certificate is requested.  If no
                     certificate is provided, the session proceeds
                     normally.  If a bad certificate is provided, it
                     will be ignored and the session proceeds normally.

              <b>try    </b>The client certificate is requested.  If no
                     certificate is provided, the session proceeds
                     normally.  If a bad certificate is provided, the
                     session is immediately terminated.

              <b>demand | hard | true</b>
                     These keywords are all equivalent, for
                     compatibility reasons.  The client certificate is
                     requested.  If no certificate is provided, or a bad
                     certificate is provided, the session is immediately
                     terminated.

              <b>TLSCRLCheck &lt;level&gt;</b>
                     Specifies if the Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
                     of the CA should be used to verify if the client
                     certificates have not been revoked. This requires
                     <b>TLSCACertificatePath </b>parameter to be set. This
                     directive is ignored with GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.
                     <b>&lt;level&gt; </b>can be specified as one of the following
                     keywords:

                     <b>none   </b>No CRL checks are performed

                     <b>peer   </b>Check the CRL of the peer certificate

                     <b>all    </b>Check the CRL for a whole certificate chain

              <b>TLSCRLFile &lt;filename&gt;</b>
                     Specifies a file containing a Certificate
                     Revocation List to be used for verifying that
                     certificates have not been revoked. This directive
                     is only valid when using GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.
</pre> <h2>
BACKEND CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Options in this section describe how the <b>lloadd </b>connects and
       authenticates to the backend servers. Backends are organised in
       groups (<b>tiers</b>).  Backends in the first tier are tried first, if
       none of them are reachable, the following tier is tried in the
       same way. If there is a backend in the tier that has suitable
       connections, but they are busy, no further tier is consulted.
       This is useful in high availability scenarios where a group of
       servers (e.g. the local environment) should be contacted if
       possible.

       It is assumed all backend servers serve the same data. On
       startup, the configured connections are set up and those not
       dedicated to handle bind requests are authenticated with the
       backend using the information in the <b>bindconf </b>option. The
       authentication configuration is shared between them.

       <b>bindconf</b>
              <b>[bindmethod=simple|sasl] [binddn=&lt;dn&gt;] [saslmech=&lt;mech&gt;]</b>
              <b>[authcid=&lt;identity&gt;] [authzid=&lt;identity&gt;]</b>
              <b>[credentials=&lt;passwd&gt;] [realm=&lt;realm&gt;]</b>
              <b>[secprops=&lt;properties&gt;] [timeout=&lt;seconds&gt;]</b>
              <b>[network-timeout=&lt;seconds&gt;]</b>
              <b>[keepalive=&lt;idle&gt;:&lt;probes&gt;:&lt;interval&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tcp-user-timeout=&lt;milliseconds&gt;] [tls_cert=&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_key=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_cacert=&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_cacertdir=&lt;path&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_cipher_suite=&lt;ciphers&gt;] [tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all]</b>
              <b>[tls_protocol_min=&lt;major&gt;[.&lt;minor&gt;]]</b>

              Specifies the bind credentials <b>lloadd </b>uses when setting up
              its regular connections to all backends.

              A <b>bindmethod </b>of <b>simple </b>requires the options <b>binddn </b>and
              <b>credentials </b>and should only be used when adequate security
              services (e.g. TLS or IPSEC) are in place.  <b>REMEMBER:</b>
              <b>simple bind credentials must be in cleartext!  </b>A
              <b>bindmethod </b>of <b>sasl </b>requires the option <b>saslmech.</b>
              Depending on the mechanism, an authentication identity
              and/or credentials can be specified using <b>authcid </b>and
              <b>credentials.  </b>The <b>authzid </b>parameter may be used to specify
              an authorization identity.  Specific security properties
              (as with the <b>sasl-secprops </b>keyword above) for a SASL bind
              can be set with the <b>secprops </b>option. A non default SASL
              realm can be set with the <b>realm </b>option.

              The <b>timeout </b>parameter indicates how long an operation can
              be pending a response (result, search entry, ...) from the
              server in seconds. Due to how timeouts are detected, the
              timeout might not be detected and handled up to <b>timeout</b>
              seconds after it happens.

              The <b>network-timeout </b>parameter sets how long the consumer
              will wait to establish a network connection to the
              provider. Once a connection is established, the <b>timeout</b>
              parameter determines how long the consumer will wait for
              the initial Bind request to complete.

              Timeout set to 0 means no timeout is in effect and by
              default, no timeouts are in effect.

              The <b>keepalive </b>parameter sets the values of <i>idle</i>, <i>probes</i>,
              and <i>interval</i> used to check whether a socket is alive; <i>idle</i>
              is the number of seconds a connection needs to remain idle
              before TCP starts sending keepalive probes; <i>probes</i> is the
              maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before
              dropping the connection; <i>interval</i> is interval in seconds
              between individual keepalive probes.  Only some systems
              support the customization of these values; the <b>keepalive</b>
              parameter is ignored otherwise, and system-wide settings
              are used.

              The <b>tcp-user-timeout </b>parameter, if non-zero, corresponds
              to the <b>TCP_USER_TIMEOUT </b>set on the upstream connections,
              overriding the operating system setting.  Only some
              systems support the customization of this parameter, it is
              ignored otherwise and system-wide settings are used.
</pre> <h2>
TIER OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tier   &lt;tier type&gt;</b>

              Groups servers which should be considered in the same try.
              If a viable connection is found even if busy, the load
              balancer does not proceed to the next tier. The process of
              selection a connection within a tier depends on the tier's
              type.

       Available types are:

       <b>roundrobin</b>
              Servers are tried in order and if one is selected
              successfully, the following search will try from the one
              next on the list.

       <b>weighted</b>
              Backend servers accept a new option <b>weight=&lt;int&gt; </b>which
              indicates how often it should be selected. If unspecified,
              weight defaults to 0 and such backends have a slight
              chance of being selected even when a non-zero weight
              backend is configured in the tier. The selection process
              is along the lines of <b>RFC2782</b>.

       <b>bestof </b>Like with <b>weighted</b><i>,</i> backends accept the <b>weight=&lt;int&gt;</b>
              option. Average latency multiplied by <b>weight </b>is measured
              over time. The selection process chooses 2 backends at
              random, compares their weighted latencies and the backend
              with a better (lower) score is tried. If the backend is
              not available (or is busy), the other backend is tried,
              then backends are chosen in a round-robin order.

              Note that unlike <b>weighted</b><i>,</i> the higher the weight, the
              higher the "effective" latency and lower the chance a
              backend is selected.
</pre> <h2>
BACKEND OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>backend-server</b>
              <b>uri=ldap[s]://&lt;hostname&gt;[:port] [retry=&lt;retry interval in</b>
              <b>ms&gt;] [starttls=yes|critical] [numconns=&lt;conns&gt;]</b>
              <b>[bindconns=&lt;conns&gt;] [max-pending-ops=&lt;ops&gt;] [conn-max-</b>
              <b>pending=&lt;ops&gt;]</b>

              Marks the beginning of a backend definition.

              <b>uri </b>specifies the backend as an LDAP URI. If &lt;port&gt; is not
              given, the standard LDAP port number (389 or 636) is used.

              Lloadd will attempt to maintain <b>numconns </b>active
              connections and also <b>bindconns </b>active connections
              dedicated to handling client bind requests.

              If an error occurs on a working connection, a new
              connection attempt is made immediately, if one happens on
              establishing a new connection to this backend, lloadd will
              wait before a new reconnect attempt is made according to
              the <b>retry </b>parameter (default is 5 seconds).

              Operations will be distributed across the backend's
              connections (<b>upstreams</b>).

              The parameter <b>conn-max-pending </b>unless set to <b>0 </b>(the
              default), will limit the number unfinished operations per
              upstream connection. Similarly, <b>max-pending-ops </b>will limit
              the total number or unfinished operations across all
              backend's connections, <b>0</b>, the default, means no limit will
              be imposed for this backend.

              The <b>starttls </b>parameter specifies use of the StartTLS
              extended operation to establish a TLS session before
              Binding to the provider. If the <b>critical </b>argument is
              supplied, the session will be aborted if the StartTLS
              request fails. Otherwise the syncrepl session continues
              without TLS. The tls_reqcert setting defaults to "demand"
              and the other TLS settings default to the same as the main
              slapd TLS settings.

LIMITATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Support for proxying SASL Binds is limited to the <b>EXTERNAL</b>
       mechanism (and only to extract the DN of a client TLS certificate
       if used during the last renegotiation) and mechanisms that rely
       neither on connection metadata (as Kerberos does) nor establish a
