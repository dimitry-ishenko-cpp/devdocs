DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/stat</i>
              Status information about the process.  This is used by
              <a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps(1)</a>.  It is defined in the kernel source file
              <i>fs/proc/array.c</i>.

              The fields, in order, with their proper <a href="../man3/scanf.3.html">scanf(3)</a> format
              specifiers, are listed below.  Whether or not certain of
              these fields display valid information is governed by a
              ptrace access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS </b>|
              <b>PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT </b>check (refer to <a href="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>).  If the
              check denies access, then the field value is displayed as
              0.  The affected fields are indicated with the marking
              [PT].

              (1) <i>pid</i>  %d
                     The process ID.

              (2) <i>comm</i>  %s
                     The filename of the executable, in parentheses.
                     Strings longer than <b>TASK_COMM_LEN </b>(16) characters
                     (including the terminating null byte) are silently
                     truncated.  This is visible whether or not the
                     executable is swapped out.

              (3) <i>state</i>  %c
                     One of the following characters, indicating process
                     state:

                     R      Running

                     S      Sleeping in an interruptible wait

                     Z      Zombie

                     T      Stopped (on a signal) or (before Linux
                            2.6.33) trace stopped

              (6) <i>session</i>  %d
                     The session ID of the process.

              (7) <i>tty_nr</i>  %d
                     The controlling terminal of the process.  (The
                     minor device number is contained in the combination
                     of bits 31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device
                     number is in bits 15 to 8.)

              (8) <i>tpgid</i>  %d
                     The ID of the foreground process group of the
                     controlling terminal of the process.

              (9) <i>flags</i>  %u
                     The kernel flags word of the process.  For bit
                     meanings, see the PF_* defines in the Linux kernel
                     source file <i>include/linux/sched.h</i>.  Details depend
                     on the kernel version.

                     The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

              (10) <i>minflt</i>  %lu
                     The number of minor faults the process has made
                     which have not required loading a memory page from
                     disk.

              (11) <i>cminflt</i>  %lu
                     The number of minor faults that the process's
                     waited-for children have made.

              (12) <i>majflt</i>  %lu
                     The number of major faults the process has made
                     which have required loading a memory page from
                     disk.

              (13) <i>cmajflt</i>  %lu
                     The number of major faults that the process's
                     waited-for children have made.

              (14) <i>utime</i>  %lu
                     Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
                     in user mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
                     <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>).  This includes guest time,
                     <i>guest_time</i> (time spent running a virtual CPU, see
                     below), so that applications that are not aware of
                     the guest time field do not lose that time from
                     their calculations.

              (15) <i>stime</i>  %lu
                     Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
                     in kernel mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
                     <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>).

              (16) <i>cutime</i>  %ld
                     Amount of time that this process's waited-for
                     children have been scheduled in user mode, measured
                     in clock ticks (divide by <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>).
                     (See also <a href="../man2/times.2.html">times(2)</a>.)  This includes guest time,
                     <i>cguest_time</i> (time spent running a virtual CPU, see
                     below).

              (17) <i>cstime</i>  %ld
                     Amount of time that this process's waited-for
                     children have been scheduled in kernel mode,
                     measured in clock ticks (divide by
                     <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>).

              (18) <i>priority</i>  %ld
                     (Explanation for Linux 2.6) For processes running a
                     real-time scheduling policy (<i>policy</i> below; see
                     <a href="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler(2)</a>), this is the negated
                     scheduling priority, minus one; that is, a number
                     in the range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time
                     priorities 1 to 99.  For processes running under a
                     non-real-time scheduling policy, this is the raw
                     nice value (<a href="../man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority(2)</a>) as represented in the
                     kernel.  The kernel stores nice values as numbers
                     in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to
                     the user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.

                     Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on
                     the scheduler weighting given to this process.

              (19) <i>nice</i>  %ld
                     The nice value (see <a href="../man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority(2)</a>), a value in the
                     range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority).

              (20) <i>num_threads</i>  %ld
                     Number of threads in this process (since Linux
                     2.6).  Before Linux 2.6, this field was hard coded
                     to 0 as a placeholder for an earlier removed field.

              (21) <i>itrealvalue</i>  %ld
                     The time in jiffies before the next <b>SIGALRM </b>is sent
                     to the process due to an interval timer.  Since
                     Linux 2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained,
                     and is hard coded as 0.

              (22) <i>starttime</i>  %llu
                     The time the process started after system boot.
                     Before Linux 2.6, this value was expressed in
                     jiffies.  Since Linux 2.6, the value is expressed
                     in clock ticks (divide by <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>).

                     The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

              (23) <i>vsize</i>  %lu
                     Virtual memory size in bytes.

              (24) <i>rss</i>  %ld
                     Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has
                     in real memory.  This is just the pages which count
                     toward text, data, or stack space.  This does not
                     include pages which have not been demand-loaded in,
                     or which are swapped out.  This value is
                     inaccurate; see <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/statm</i> below.

              (25) <i>rsslim</i>  %lu
                     Current soft limit in bytes on the rss of the
                     process; see the description of <b>RLIMIT_RSS </b>in
                     <a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit(2)</a>.

              (26) <i>startcode</i>  %lu  [PT]
                     The address above which program text can run.

              (27) <i>endcode</i>  %lu  [PT]

                     The address of the start (i.e., bottom) of the
                     stack.

              (29) <i>kstkesp</i>  %lu  [PT]
                     The current value of ESP (stack pointer), as found
                     in the kernel stack page for the process.

              (30) <i>kstkeip</i>  %lu  [PT]
                     The current EIP (instruction pointer).

                     The bitmap of pending signals, displayed as a
                     decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
                     provide information on real-time signals; use

                     The bitmap of blocked signals, displayed as a
                     decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
                     provide information on real-time signals; use
                     <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/status</i> instead.

              (33) <i>sigignore</i>  %lu
                     The bitmap of ignored signals, displayed as a
                     decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
                     provide information on real-time signals; use
                     <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/status</i> instead.

              (34) <i>sigcatch</i>  %lu
                     The bitmap of caught signals, displayed as a
                     decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
                     provide information on real-time signals; use

                     This is the "channel" in which the process is
                     waiting.  It is the address of a location in the
                     kernel where the process is sleeping.  The
                     corresponding symbolic name can be found in
