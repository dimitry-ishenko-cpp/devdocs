       org.freedesktop.resolve1 - The D-Bus interface of
       systemd-resolved
</pre> <h2>
INTRODUCTION </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a> is a system service that provides
       hostname resolution and caching using DNS, LLMNR, and mDNS. It
       also does DNSSEC validation. This page describes the resolve
       semantics and the D-Bus interface.

       This page contains an API reference only. If you are looking for
       a longer explanation how to use this API, please consult <b>Writing</b>

THE MANAGER OBJECT </h2>
<pre>
       The service exposes the following interfaces on the Manager
       object on the bus:

           node /org/freedesktop/resolve1 {
             interface org.freedesktop.resolve1.Manager {
               methods:
                 ResolveHostname(in  i ifindex,
                                 in  s name,
                                 in  i family,
                                 in  t flags,

   <b>Methods</b>
       <b>ResolveHostname() </b>takes a hostname and resolves it to one or more
       IP addresses. As parameters it takes the Linux network interface
       index to execute the query on, or 0 if it may be done on any
       suitable interface. The <i>name</i> parameter specifies the hostname to
       resolve. Note that if required, IDNA conversion is applied to
       this name unless it is resolved via LLMNR or MulticastDNS. The
       <i>family</i> parameter limits the results to a specific address family.
       It may be <b>AF_INET</b>, <b>AF_INET6 </b>or <b>AF_UNSPEC</b>. If <b>AF_UNSPEC </b>is
       specified (recommended), both kinds are retrieved, subject to
       local network configuration (i.e. if no local, routable IPv6
       address is found, no IPv6 address is retrieved; and similarly for
       IPv4). A 64-bit <i>flags</i> field may be used to alter the behaviour of
       the resolver operation (see below). The method returns an array
       of address records. Each address record consists of the interface
       index the address belongs to, an address family as well as a byte
       array with the actual IP address data (which either has 4 or 16
       elements, depending on the address family). The returned address
       family will be one of <b>AF_INET </b>or <b>AF_INET6</b>. For IPv6, the returned
       address interface index should be used to initialize the
       .sin6_scope_id field of a struct sockaddr_in6 instance to permit
       support for resolution to link-local IP addresses. The address
       array is followed by the canonical name of the host, which may or
       may not be identical to the resolved hostname. Finally, a 64-bit
       <i>flags</i> field is returned that is defined similarly to the <i>flags</i>
       field that was passed in, but contains information about the
       resolved data (see below). If the hostname passed in is an IPv4
       or IPv6 address formatted as string, it is parsed, and the result
       is returned. In this case, no network communication is done.

       <b>ResolveAddress() </b>executes the reverse operation: it takes an IP
       address and acquires one or more hostnames for it. As parameters
       it takes the interface index to execute the query on, or <b>0 </b>if all
       suitable interfaces are OK. The <i>family</i> parameter indicates the
       address family of the IP address to resolve. It may be either
       <b>AF_INET </b>or <b>AF_INET6</b>. The <i>address</i> parameter takes the raw IP
       address data (as either a 4 or 16 byte array). The <i>flags</i> input
       parameter may be used to alter the resolver operation (see
       below). The method returns an array of name records, each
       consisting of an interface index and a hostname. The <i>flags</i> output
       field contains additional information about the resolver
       operation (see below).

       <b>ResolveRecord() </b>takes a DNS resource record (RR) type, class and
       name, and retrieves the full resource record set (RRset),
       including the RDATA, for it. As parameter it takes the Linux
       network interface index to execute the query on, or <b>0 </b>if it may
       be done on any suitable interface. The <i>name</i> parameter specifies
       the RR domain name to look up (no IDNA conversion is applied),
       followed by the 16-bit class and type fields (which may be ANY).
       Finally, a <i>flags</i> field may be passed in to alter behaviour of the
       look-up (see below). On completion, an array of RR items is
       returned. Each array entry consists of the network interface
       index the RR was discovered on, the type and class field of the
       RR found, and a byte array of the raw RR discovered. The raw RR
       data starts with the RR's domain name, in the original casing,
       followed by the RR type, class, TTL and RDATA, in the binary
       format documented in <b>RFC 1035</b>[3]. For RRs that support name
       compression in the payload (such as MX or PTR), the compression
       is expanded in the returned data.

       Note that currently, the class field has to be specified as IN or
       ANY. Specifying a different class will return an error indicating
       that look-ups of this kind are unsupported. Similarly, some
       special types are not supported either (AXFR, OPT, ...). While
       systemd-resolved parses and validates resource records of many
       types, it is crucial that clients using this API understand that
       the RR data originates from the network and should be thoroughly
       validated before use.

       <b>ResolveService() </b>may be used to resolve a DNS <b>SRV </b>service record,
       as well as the hostnames referenced in it, and possibly an
       accompanying DNS-SD <b>TXT </b>record containing additional service
       metadata. The primary benefit of using this method over
       <b>ResolveRecord() </b>specifying the <b>SRV </b>type is that it will resolve
       the <b>SRV </b>and <b>TXT </b>RRs as well as the hostnames referenced in the
       SRV in a single operation. As parameters it takes a Linux network
       interface index, a service name, a service type and a service
       domain. This method may be invoked in three different modes:

        1. To resolve a DNS-SD service, specify the service name (e.g.
           "Lennart's Files"), the service type (e.g.  "_webdav._tcp")
           and the domain to search in (e.g.  "local") as the three
           service parameters. The service name must be in UTF-8 format,
           and no IDNA conversion is applied to it in this mode (as
           mandated by the DNS-SD specifications). However, if
           necessary, IDNA conversion is applied to the domain
           parameter.

        2. To resolve a plain <b>SRV </b>record, set the service name parameter
           to the empty string and set the service type and domain
           properly. (IDNA conversion is applied to the domain, if
           necessary.)

        3. Alternatively, leave both the service name and type empty and
           specify the full domain name of the <b>SRV </b>record (i.e. prefixed
           with the service type) in the domain parameter. (No IDNA
           conversion is applied in this mode.)

       The <i>family</i> parameter of the <b>ResolveService() </b>method encodes the
       desired family of the addresses to resolve (use <b>AF_INET</b>,
       <b>AF_INET6</b>, or <b>AF_UNSPEC</b>). If this is enabled (Use the <b>NO_ADDRESS</b>
       flag to turn address resolution off, see below). The <i>flags</i>
       parameter takes a couple of flags that may be used to alter the
       resolver operation.

       On completion, <b>ResolveService() </b>returns an array of <b>SRV </b>record
       structures. Each items consisting of the priority, weight and
       port fields as well as the hostname to contact, as encoded in the
       <b>SRV </b>record. Immediately following is an array of the addresses of
       this hostname, with each item consisting of the interface index,
       the address family and the address data in a byte array. This
       address array is followed by the canonicalized hostname. After
       this array of <b>SRV </b>record structures an array of byte arrays
       follows that encodes the TXT RR strings, in case DNS-SD look-ups
       are enabled. The next parameters are the canonical service name,
       type and domain. This may or may not be identical to the
       parameters passed in. Finally, a <i>flags</i> field is returned that
       contains information about the resolver operation performed.

       The <b>ResetStatistics() </b>method resets the various statistics
       counters that systemd-resolved maintains to zero. (For details,
       see the statistics properties below.)

       The <b>GetLink() </b>method takes a network interface index and returns
       the object path to the org.freedesktop.resolve1.Link object
       corresponding to it.

       The <b>SetLinkDNS() </b>method sets the DNS servers to use on a specific
       interface. This method (and the following ones) may be used by
       network management software to configure per-interface DNS
       settings. It takes a network interface index as well as an array
       of DNS server IP address records. Each array item consists of an
       address family (either <b>AF_INET </b>or <b>AF_INET6</b>), followed by a 4-byte
       or 16-byte array with the raw address data. This method is a
       one-step shortcut for retrieving the Link object for a network
       interface using <b>GetLink() </b>(see above) and then invoking the
       <b>SetDNS() </b>method (see below) on it.

       <b>SetLinkDNSEx() </b>is similar to <b>SetLinkDNS()</b>, but allows an IP port
       (instead of the default 53) and DNS name to be specified for each
       DNS server. The server name is used for Server Name Indication
       (SNI), which is useful when DNS-over-TLS is used. C.f.  <i>DNS=</i> in
       <a href="resolved.conf.5.html">resolved.conf(5)</a>.

       <b>SetLinkDefaultRoute() </b>specifies whether the link shall be used as
       the default route for name queries. See the description of name
       routing in <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a> for details.

       The <b>SetLinkDomains() </b>method sets the search and routing domains
       to use on a specific network interface for DNS look-ups. It takes
       a network interface index and an array of domains, each with a
       boolean parameter indicating whether the specified domain shall
       be used as a search domain (false), or just as a routing domain
       (true). Search domains are used for qualifying single-label names
       into FQDN when looking up hostnames, as well as for making
       routing decisions on which interface to send queries ending in
       the domain to. Routing domains are only used for routing
       decisions and not used for single-label name qualification. Pass
       the search domains in the order they should be used.

       The <b>SetLinkLLMNR() </b>method enables or disables LLMNR support on a
       specific network interface. It takes a network interface index as
       well as a string that may either be empty or one of "yes", "no"
       or "resolve". If empty, the systemd-wide default LLMNR setting is
       used. If "yes", LLMNR is used for resolution of single-label
       names and the local hostname is registered on all local LANs for
       LLMNR resolution by peers. If "no", LLMNR is turned off fully on
       this interface. If "resolve", LLMNR is only enabled for resolving
       names, but the local hostname is not registered for other peers
       to use.

       Similarly, the <b>SetLinkMulticastDNS() </b>method enables or disables
       MulticastDNS support on a specific interface. It takes the same
       parameters as <b>SetLinkLLMNR() </b>described above.

       The <b>SetLinkDNSSEC() </b>method enables or disables DNSSEC validation
       on a specific network interface. It takes a network interface
       index as well as a string that may either be empty or one of
       "yes", "no", or "allow-downgrade". When empty, the system-wide
       default DNSSEC setting is used. If "yes", full DNSSEC validation
       is done for all look-ups. If the selected DNS server does not
       support DNSSEC, look-ups will fail if this mode is used. If "no",
       DNSSEC validation is fully disabled. If "allow-downgrade", DNSSEC
       validation is enabled, but is turned off automatically if the
       selected server does not support it (thus opening up behaviour to
       downgrade attacks). Note that DNSSEC only applies to traditional
       DNS, not to LLMNR or MulticastDNS.

       The <b>SetLinkDNSSECNegativeTrustAnchors() </b>method may be used to
       configure DNSSEC Negative Trust Anchors (NTAs) for a specific
       network interface. It takes a network interface index and a list
       of domains as arguments.

       The <b>SetLinkDNSOverTLS() </b>method enables or disables DNS-over-TLS.
       C.f.  <i>DNSOverTLS=</i> in <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a> for details.

       Network management software integrating with systemd-resolved
       should call <b>SetLinkDNS() </b>or <b>SetLinkDNSEx()</b>,
       <b>SetLinkDefaultRoute()</b>, <b>SetLinkDomains() </b>and others after the
       interface appeared in the kernel (and thus after a network
       interface index has been assigned), but before the network
       interfaces is activated (<b>IFF_UP </b>set) so that all settings take
       effect during the full time the network interface is up. It is
       safe to alter settings while the interface is up, however. Use
       <b>RevertLink() </b>(described below) to reset all per-interface
       settings.

       The <b>RevertLink() </b>method may be used to revert all per-link
       settings described above to the defaults.

       The <b>FlushCaches() </b>flushes all resource record caches maintained
       by the resolver, and ensures that any subsequent lookups
       re-request their responses from their sources.

       The <b>ResetServerFeatures() </b>flushes any feature information learned
       about remote DNS servers. This ensures that subsequent lookups
       will be initially attempted at the highest DNS protocol feature
       level again, possibly requiring a (potentially slow) downgrade
       cycle to recognize the supported feature level again.

       The <b>RegisterService() </b>method may be used to register a DNS-SD
       service on the host. This functionality is closely related to the
       functionality provided by <a href="systemd.dnssd.5.html">systemd.dnssd(5)</a> files. It takes a
       server identifier string as first parameter (this is just a local
       identifier, and should be chosen so that it neither collides with
       the basename of *.dnssd files nor with names chosen by other IPC
       clients). It also takes a name template string for the DNS-SD
       service name visible on the network. This string is subject to
       specifier expansation, as documented for the <i>Name=</i> setting in
       *.dnssd files. It also takes a service type string containing the
       DNS-SD service type, as well as an IP port, a priority/weight
       pair for the DNS-SD SRV record. Finally, it takes an array of TXT
       record data. It returns an object path which may be used as
       handle to the registered service.

       The <b>UnregisterService() </b>method undoes the effect of
       <b>RegisterService() </b>and deletes a DNS-SD service previously created
       via IPC again.

       <b>The Flags Parameter</b>

           The four methods above accept and return a 64-bit flags
           value. In most cases passing 0 is sufficient and recommended.
           However, the following flags are defined to alter the
           look-up:

               /* Input+Output: Protocol/scope */
               #define SD_RESOLVED_DNS                (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt;  0)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_LLMNR_IPV4         (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt;  1)

               #define SD_RESOLVED_MDNS_IPV6          (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt;  4)

               /* Input: Restrictions */
               #define SD_RESOLVED_NO_CNAME           (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt;  5)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_NO_TXT             (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt;  6)

               #define SD_RESOLVED_NO_VALIDATE        (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 10)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_NO_SYNTHESIZE      (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 11)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_NO_CACHE           (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 12)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_NO_ZONE            (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 13)

               #define SD_RESOLVED_NO_NETWORK         (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 15)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_NO_STALE           (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 24)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_RELAX_SINGLE_LABEL (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 25)

               /* Output: Security */
               #define SD_RESOLVED_AUTHENTICATED      (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt;  9)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_CONFIDENTIAL       (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 18)

               /* Output: Origin */
               #define SD_RESOLVED_SYNTHETIC          (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 19)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_FROM_CACHE         (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 20)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_FROM_ZONE          (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 21)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_FROM_TRUST_ANCHOR  (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 22)
               #define SD_RESOLVED_FROM_NETWORK       (UINT64_C(1) &lt;&lt; 23)

           On input, the first five flags control the protocols to use
           for the look-up. They refer to classic unicast DNS, LLMNR via
           IPv4/UDP and IPv6/UDP respectively, as well as MulticastDNS
           via IPv4/UDP and IPv6/UDP. If all of these five bits are off
           on input (which is strongly recommended) the look-up will be
           done via all suitable protocols for the specific look-up.
           Note that these flags operate as filter only, but cannot
           force a look-up to be done via a protocol. Specifically,
           systemd-resolved will only route look-ups within the .local
           TLD to MulticastDNS (plus some reverse look-up address
           domains), and single-label names to LLMNR (plus some reverse
           address lookup domains). It will route neither of these to
           Unicast DNS servers. Also, it will do LLMNR and Multicast DNS
           only on interfaces suitable for multicast.

           On output, these five flags indicate which protocol was used
           to execute the operation, and hence where the data was found.

           The primary use cases for these five flags are follow-up
           look-ups based on DNS data retrieved earlier. In this case it
           is often a good idea to limit the follow-up look-up to the
           protocol that was used to discover the first DNS result.

           The NO_CNAME flag controls whether CNAME/DNAME resource
           records shall be followed during the look-up. This flag is
           only available at input, none of the functions will return it
           on output. If a CNAME/DNAME RR is discovered while resolving
           a hostname, an error is returned instead. By default, when
           the flag is off, CNAME/DNAME RRs are followed.

           The NO_TXT and NO_ADDRESS flags only influence operation of
           the <b>ResolveService() </b>method. They are only defined for input,
           not output. If NO_TXT is set, the DNS-SD TXT RR look-up is
           not done in the same operation. If NO_ADDRESS is set, the
           discovered hostnames are not implicitly translated to their
           addresses.

           The NO_SEARCH flag turns off the search domain logic. It is
           only defined for input in <b>ResolveHostname()</b>. When specified,
           single-label hostnames are not qualified using defined search
           domains, if any are configured. Note that <b>ResolveRecord()</b>
           will never qualify single-label domain names using search
           domains. Also note that multi-label hostnames are never
           subject to search list expansion.

           NO_VALIDATE can be set to disable validation via DNSSEC even
           if it would normally be used.

           The next six flags allow disabling certain sources during
           resolution. NO_SYNTHESIZE disables synthetic records, e.g.
           the local host name, see section SYNTHETIC RECORDS in
           <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a> for more information. NO_CACHE
           disables the use of the cache of previously resolved records.
           NO_ZONE disables answers using locally registered public
           LLMNR/mDNS resource records. NO_TRUST_ANCHOR disables answers
           using locally configured trust anchors. NO_NETWORK requires
           all answers to be provided without using the network, i.e.
           either from local sources or the cache. NO_STALE flag can be
           set to disable answering request with stale records.

           The AUTHENTICATED bit is defined only in the output flags of
           the four functions. If set, the returned data has been fully
           authenticated. Specifically, this bit is set for all
           DNSSEC-protected data for which a full trust chain may be
           established to a trusted domain anchor. It is also set for
           locally synthesized data, such as "localhost" or data from
           /etc/hosts. Moreover, it is set for all LLMNR or mDNS RRs
           which originate from the local host. Applications that
           require authenticated RR data for operation should check this
           flag before trusting the data. Note that systemd-resolved
           will never return invalidated data, hence this flag simply
           allows one to discern the cases where data is known to be
           trusted, or where there is proof that the data is
           "rightfully" unauthenticated (which includes cases where the
           underlying protocol or server does not support authenticating
           data).

           CONFIDENTIAL means the query was resolved via encrypted
           channels or never left this system.

           The next five bits flags are used in output and provide
           information about the origin of the answer. FROM_SYNTHETIC
           means the query was (at least partially) synthesized locally.
           FROM_CACHE means the query was answered (at least partially)
           using the cache. FROM_ZONE means the query was answered (at
           least partially) based on public, locally registered records.
           FROM_TRUST_ANCHOR means the query was answered (at least
           partially) using local trust anchors. FROM_NETWORK means the
           query was answered (at least partially) using the network.

   <b>Properties</b>
       The <i>LLMNR</i> and <i>MulticastDNS</i> properties report whether LLMNR and
       MulticastDNS are (globally) enabled. Each may be one of "yes",
       "no", and "resolve". See <b>SetLinkLLMNR() </b>and <b>SetLinkMulticastDNS()</b>
       above.

       <i>LLMNRHostname</i> contains the hostname currently exposed on the
       network via LLMNR. It usually follows the system hostname as may
       be queried via <b>gethostname</b>(3), but may differ if a conflict is
       detected on the network.

       <i>DNS</i> and <i>DNSEx</i> contain arrays of all DNS servers currently used by
       systemd-resolved.  <i>DNS</i> contains information similar to the DNS
       server data in /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf. Each structure
       in the array consists of a numeric network interface index, an
       address family, and a byte array containing the DNS server
       address (either 4 bytes in length for IPv4 or 16 bytes in lengths
       for IPv6).  <i>DNSEx</i> is similar, but additionally contains the IP
       port and server name (used for Server Name Indication, SNI). Both
       arrays contain DNS servers configured system-wide, including
       those possibly read from a foreign /etc/resolv.conf or the <i>DNS=</i>
       setting in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, as well as per-interface
       DNS server information either retrieved from <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.8.html">systemd-networkd(8)</a>,
       or configured by external software via <b>SetLinkDNS() </b>or
       <b>SetLinkDNSEx() </b>(see above). The network interface index will be 0
       for the system-wide configured services and non-zero for the
       per-link servers.

       <i>FallbackDNS</i> and <i>FallbackDNSEx</i> contain arrays of all DNS servers
       configured as fallback servers, if any, using the same format as
       <i>DNS</i> and <i>DNSEx</i> described above. See the description of
       <i>FallbackDNS=</i> in <a href="resolved.conf.5.html">resolved.conf(5)</a> for the description of when
       those servers are used.

       <i>CurrentDNSServer</i> and <i>CurrentDNSServerEx</i> specify the server that
       is currently used for query resolution, in the same format as a
       single entry in the <i>DNS</i> and <i>DNSEx</i> arrays described above.

       Similarly, the <i>Domains</i> property contains an array of all search
       and routing domains currently used by systemd-resolved. Each
       entry consists of a network interface index (again, 0 encodes
       system-wide entries), the actual domain name, and whether the
       entry is used only for routing (true) or for both routing and
       searching (false).

       The <i>TransactionStatistics</i> property contains information about the
       number of transactions systemd-resolved has processed. It
       contains a pair of unsigned 64-bit counters, the first containing
       the number of currently ongoing transactions, the second the
       number of total transactions systemd-resolved is processing or
       has processed. The latter value may be reset using the
       <b>ResetStatistics() </b>method described above. Note that the number of
       transactions does not directly map to the number of issued
       resolver bus method calls. While simple look-ups usually require
       a single transaction only, more complex look-ups might result in
       more, for example when CNAMEs or DNSSEC are in use.

       The <i>CacheStatistics</i> property contains information about the
       executed cache operations so far. It exposes three 64-bit
       counters: the first being the total number of current cache
       entries (both positive and negative), the second the number of
       cache hits, and the third the number of cache misses. The latter
       counters may be reset using <b>ResetStatistics() </b>(see above).

       The <i>DNSSEC</i> property specifies current status of DNSSEC
       validation. It is one of "yes" (validation is enforced), "no" (no
       validation is done), "allow-downgrade" (validation is done if the
       current DNS server supports it). See the description of <i>DNSSEC=</i>
       in <a href="resolved.conf.5.html">resolved.conf(5)</a>.

       The <i>DNSSECStatistics</i> property contains information about the
       DNSSEC validations executed so far. It contains four 64-bit
       counters: the number of secure, insecure, bogus, and
       indeterminate DNSSEC validations so far. The counters are
       increased for each validated RRset, and each non-existence proof.
       The secure counter is increased for each operation that
       successfully verified a signed reply, the insecure counter is
       increased for each operation that successfully verified that an
       unsigned reply is rightfully unsigned. The bogus counter is
       increased for each operation where the validation did not check
       out and the data is likely to have been tempered with. Finally
       the indeterminate counter is increased for each operation which
       did not complete because the necessary keys could not be acquired
       or the cryptographic algorithms were unknown.

       The <i>DNSSECSupported</i> boolean property reports whether DNSSEC is
       enabled and the selected DNS servers support it. It combines
       information about system-wide and per-link DNS settings (see
       below), and only reports true if DNSSEC is enabled and supported
       on every interface for which DNS is configured and for the
       system-wide settings if there are any. Note that systemd-resolved
       assumes DNSSEC is supported by DNS servers until it verifies that
       this is not the case. Thus, the reported value may initially be
       true, until the first transactions are executed.

       The <i>DNSOverTLS</i> boolean property reports whether DNS-over-TLS is
       enabled.

       The <i>ResolvConfMode</i> property exposes how /etc/resolv.conf is
       managed on the host. Currently, the values "uplink", "stub",
       "static" (these three correspond to the three different files
       systemd-resolved.service provides), "foreign" (the file is
       managed by admin or another service, systemd-resolved.service
       just consumes it), "missing" (/etc/resolv.conf is missing).

       The <i>DNSStubListener</i> property reports whether the stub listener on
       port 53 is enabled. Possible values are "yes" (enabled), "no"
       (disabled), "udp" (only the UDP listener is enabled), and "tcp"
       (only the TCP listener is enabled).

       The <i>DNSSECNegativeTrustAnchors</i> property contains a list of
       recognized DNSSEC negative trust anchors and contains a list of
       domains.

       For each Linux network interface a "Link" object is created which
       exposes per-link DNS configuration and state. Use <b>GetLink() </b>on
       the Manager interface to retrieve the object path for a link
       object given the network interface index (see above).

   <b>Methods</b>
       The various methods exposed by the Link interface are equivalent
       to their similarly named counterparts on the Manager interface.
       e.g.  <b>SetDNS() </b>on the Link object maps to <b>SetLinkDNS() </b>on the
       Manager object, the main difference being that the later expects
       an interface index to be specified. Invoking the methods on the
       Manager interface has the benefit of reducing roundtrips, as it
       is not necessary to first request the Link object path via
       <b>GetLink() </b>before invoking the methods. The same relationship
       holds for <b>SetDNSEx()</b>, <b>SetDomains()</b>, <b>SetDefaultRoute()</b>,
       <b>SetLLMNR()</b>, <b>SetMulticastDNS()</b>, <b>SetDNSOverTLS()</b>, <b>SetDNSSEC()</b>,
       <b>SetDNSSECNegativeTrustAnchors()</b>, and <b>Revert()</b>. For further
       details on these methods see the Manager documentation above.

   <b>Properties</b>
       <i>ScopesMask</i> defines which resolver scopes are currently active on
       this interface. This 64-bit unsigned integer field is a bit mask
       consisting of a subset of the bits of the flags parameter
       describe above. Specifically, it may have the DNS, LLMNR and MDNS
       bits (the latter in IPv4 and IPv6 flavours) set. Each individual
       bit is set when the protocol applies to a specific interface and
       is enabled for it. It is unset otherwise. Specifically, a
       multicast-capable interface in the "UP" state with an IP address
       is suitable for LLMNR or MulticastDNS, and any interface that is
       UP and has an IP address is suitable for DNS. Note the
       relationship of the bits exposed here with the LLMNR and
       MulticastDNS properties also exposed on the Link interface. The
       latter expose what is *configured* to be used on the interface,
       the former expose what is actually used on the interface, taking
       into account the abilities of the interface.

       <i>DNSSECSupported</i> exposes a boolean field that indicates whether
       DNSSEC is currently configured and in use on the interface. Note
       that if DNSSEC is enabled on an interface, it is assumed
       available until it is detected that the configured server does
       not actually support it. Thus, this property may initially report
       that DNSSEC is supported on an interface.

       <i>DefaultRoute</i> exposes a boolean field that indicates whether the
       interface will be used as default route for name queries. See
       <b>SetLinkDefaultRoute() </b>above.

       The other properties reflect the state of the various
       configuration settings for the link which may be set with the
       various methods calls such as <b>SetDNS() </b>or <b>SetLLMNR()</b>.

COMMON ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Many bus methods systemd-resolved exposes (in particular the
       resolver methods such as <b>ResolveHostname() </b>on the Manager
       interface) may return some of the following errors:

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.NoNameServers</b>
           No suitable DNS servers were found to resolve a request.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.InvalidReply</b>
           A response from the selected DNS server was not understood.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.NoSuchRR</b>
           The requested name exists, but there is no resource record of
           the requested type for it. (This is the DNS NODATA case).

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.CNameLoop</b>
           The look-up failed because a CNAME or DNAME loop was
           detected.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.Aborted</b>
           The look-up was aborted because the selected protocol became
           unavailable while the operation was ongoing.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.NoSuchService</b>
           A service look-up was successful, but the <b>SRV </b>record reported
           that the service is not available.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.DnssecFailed</b>
           The acquired response did not pass DNSSEC validation.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.NoTrustAnchor</b>
           No chain of trust could be established for the response to a
           configured DNSSEC trust anchor.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.ResourceRecordTypeUnsupported</b>
           The requested resource record type is not supported on the
           selected DNS servers. This error is generated for example
           when an RRSIG record is requested from a DNS server that does
           not support DNSSEC.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.NoSuchLink</b>
           No network interface with the specified network interface
           index exists.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.LinkBusy</b>
           The requested configuration change could not be made because
           <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.8.html">systemd-networkd(8)</a>, already took possession of the interface
           and supplied configuration data for it.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.NetworkDown</b>
           The requested look-up failed because the system is currently
           not connected to any suitable network.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.DnsError.NXDOMAIN</b>,
       <b>org.freedesktop.resolve1.DnsError.REFUSED</b>, ...
           The look-up failed with a DNS return code reporting a
           failure. The error names used as suffixes here are defined in
           by IANA in <b>DNS RCODEs</b>[4].

           Added in version 246.
