<span class="headline"><i>SUAUTH</i>(5)            File Formats and Configuration            <i>SUAUTH</i>(5)</span>
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       suauth - detailed su control file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>/etc/suauth</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The file /etc/suauth is referenced whenever the su command is
       called. It can change the behaviour of the su command, based
       upon:

                 1) the user su is targeting

       2) the user executing the su command (or any groups he might be a
       member of)

       The file is formatted like this, with lines starting with a #
       being treated as comment lines and ignored;

                 to-id:from-id:ACTION

       Where to-id is either the word <i>ALL</i>, a list of usernames delimited
       by "," or the words <i>ALL EXCEPT</i> followed by a list of usernames
       delimited by ",".

       from-id is formatted the same as to-id except the extra word
       <i>GROUP</i> is recognized.  <i>ALL EXCEPT GROUP</i> is perfectly valid too.
       Following <i>GROUP</i> appears one or more group names, delimited by
       ",". It is not sufficient to have primary group id of the
       relevant group, an entry in <b>/etc/group</b>(5) is necessary.

       Action can be one only of the following currently supported
       options.

       <i>DENY</i>
           The attempt to su is stopped before a password is even asked
           for.

       <i>NOPASS</i>
           The attempt to su is automatically successful; no password is
           asked for.

       <i>OWNPASS</i>
           For the su command to be successful, the user must enter his
           or her own password. They are told this.

       Note there are three separate fields delimited by a colon. No
       whitespace must surround this colon. Also note that the file is
       examined sequentially line by line, and the first applicable rule
       is used without examining the file further. This makes it
       possible for a system administrator to exercise as fine control
       as he or she wishes.

EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
                 # sample /etc/suauth file
                 #
                 # A couple of privileged usernames may
                 # su to root with their own password.
                 #
                 root:chris,birddog:OWNPASS
                 #
                 # Anyone else may not su to root unless in
                 # group wheel. This is how BSD does things.
                 #
                 root:ALL EXCEPT GROUP wheel:DENY
                 #
                 # Perhaps terry and birddog are accounts
                 # owned by the same person.
                 # Access can be arranged between them
                 # with no password.
                 #
                 terry:birddog:NOPASS
                 birddog:terry:NOPASS
                 #

       /etc/suauth
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       There could be plenty lurking. The file parser is particularly
       unforgiving about syntax errors, expecting no spurious whitespace
       (apart from beginning and end of lines), and a specific token
       delimiting different things.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       An error parsing the file is reported using <b>syslogd</b>(8) as level
       ERR on facility AUTH.
