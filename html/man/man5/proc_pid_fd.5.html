NAME </h2>

       /proc/pid/fd/ - file descriptors
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd/</i>
              This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file
              which the process has open, named by its file descriptor,
              and which is a symbolic link to the actual file.  Thus, 0
              is standard input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error,
              and so on.

              For file descriptors for pipes and sockets, the entries
              will be symbolic links whose content is the file type with
              the inode.  A <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink(2)</a> call on this file returns a
              string in the format:

                  type:[inode]

              For example, <i>socket:[2248868]</i> will be a socket and its
              inode is 2248868.  For sockets, that inode can be used to
              find more information in one of the files under
              <i>/proc/net/</i>.

              For file descriptors that have no corresponding inode
              (e.g., file descriptors produced by <a href="../man2/bpf.2.html">bpf(2)</a>,
              <a href="../man2/epoll_create.2.html">epoll_create(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/eventfd.2.html">eventfd(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/inotify_init.2.html">inotify_init(2)</a>,
              <a href="../man2/perf_event_open.2.html">perf_event_open(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/signalfd.2.html">signalfd(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/timerfd_create.2.html">timerfd_create(2)</a>, and
              <a href="../man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd(2)</a>), the entry will be a symbolic link with
              contents of the form

                  anon_inode:<i>file-type</i>

              In many cases (but not all), the <i>file-type</i> is surrounded
              by square brackets.

              For example, an epoll file descriptor will have a symbolic
              link whose content is the string <i>anon_inode:[eventpoll]</i>.

              In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory
              are not available if the main thread has already
              terminated (typically by calling <a href="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit(3)</a>).

              Programs that take a filename as a command-line argument,
              but don't take input from standard input if no argument is
              supplied, and programs that write to a file named as a
              command-line argument, but don't send their output to
              standard output if no argument is supplied, can
              nevertheless be made to use standard input or standard
              output by using <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd</i> files as command-line
              arguments.  For example, assuming that <i>-i</i> is the flag
              designating an input file and <i>-o</i> is the flag designating
              an output file:

                  $ <b>foobar -i /proc/self/fd/0 -o /proc/self/fd/1 ...</b>

              and you have a working filter.

              <i>/proc/self/fd/N</i> is approximately the same as <i>/dev/fd/N</i> in
              some UNIX and UNIX-like systems.  Most Linux MAKEDEV
              scripts symbolically link <i>/dev/fd</i> to <i>/proc/self/fd</i>, in
              fact.

              Most systems provide symbolic links <i>/dev/stdin</i>,
              <i>/dev/stdout</i>, and <i>/dev/stderr</i>, which respectively link to
              the files <i>0</i>, <i>1</i>, and <i>2</i> in <i>/proc/self/fd</i>.  Thus the example
              command above could be written as:

                  $ <b>foobar -i /dev/stdin -o /dev/stdout ...</b>

              Permission to dereference or read (<a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink(2)</a>) the
              symbolic links in this directory is governed by a ptrace
              access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS </b>check; see <a href="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>.

              Note that for file descriptors referring to inodes (pipes
              and sockets, see above), those inodes still have
              permission bits and ownership information distinct from
              those of the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd</i> entry, and that the owner may
              differ from the user and group IDs of the process.  An
              unprivileged process may lack permissions to open them, as
              in this example:

                  $ <b>echo test | sudo -u nobody cat</b>
                  test
                  $ <b>echo test | sudo -u nobody cat /proc/self/fd/0</b>
                  cat: /proc/self/fd/0: Permission denied

              File descriptor 0 refers to the pipe created by the shell
              and owned by that shell's user, which is not <i>nobody</i>, so
              <b>cat </b>does not have permission to create a new file
              descriptor to read from that inode, even though it can
              still read from its existing file descriptor 0.
