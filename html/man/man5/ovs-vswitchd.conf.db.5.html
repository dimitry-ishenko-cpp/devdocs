       ovs-vswitchd.conf.db - Open_vSwitch database schema

       A database with this schema holds the configuration for one Open
       vSwitch daemon. The top-level configuration for the daemon is the
       <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table, which must have exactly one record. Records
       in other tables are significant only when they can be reached
       directly or indirectly from the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table. Records that
       are not reachable from the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table are automatically
       deleted from the database, except for records in a few
       distinguished ``root set’’ tables.

   <b>Common Columns</b>
       Most tables contain two special columns, named <b>other_config </b>and
       <b>external_ids</b>. These columns have the same form and purpose each
       place that they appear, so we describe them here to save space
       later.

              <b>other_config</b>: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for configuring rarely used
                     features. Supported keys, along with the forms
                     taken by their values, are documented individually
                     for each table.

                     A few tables do not have <b>other_config </b>columns
                     because no key-value pairs have yet been defined
                     for them.

              <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that
                     integrate with Open vSwitch, rather than by Open
                     vSwitch itself. System integrators should either
                     use the Open vSwitch development mailing list to
                     coordinate on common key-value definitions, or
                     choose key names that are likely to be unique. In
                     some cases, where key-value pairs have been defined
                     that are likely to be widely useful, they are
                     documented individually for each table.

   <b>Details:</b>
     <i>Configuration:</i>

       <b>datapaths</b>: map of string-<b>Datapath </b>pairs
              Map of datapath types to datapaths. The <b>datapath_type</b>
              column of the <b>Bridge </b>table is used as a key for this map.
              The value points to a row in the <b>Datapath </b>table.

       <b>bridges</b>: set of <b>Bridge</b>s
              Set of bridges managed by the daemon.

       <b>ssl</b>: optional <b>SSL</b>
              SSL used globally by the daemon.

       <b>external_ids : system-id</b>: optional string
              A unique identifier for the Open vSwitch’s physical host.
              The form of the identifier depends on the type of the
              host.

       <b>external_ids : hostname</b>: optional string
              The hostname for the host running Open vSwitch. This is a
              fully qualified domain name since version 2.6.2.

       <b>external_ids : rundir</b>: optional string
              In Open vSwitch 2.8 and later, the run directory of the
              running Open vSwitch daemon. This directory is used for
              runtime state such as control and management sockets. The
              value of <b>other_config:vhost-sock-dir </b>is relative to this
              directory.

       <b>other_config : stats-update-interval</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, at least 5,000
              Interval for updating statistics to the database, in
              milliseconds. This option will affect the update of the
              <b>statistics </b>column in the following tables: <b>Port</b>, <b>Interface</b>
              , <b>Mirror</b>.

              Default value is 5000 ms.

              Getting statistics more frequently can be achieved via
              OpenFlow.

       <b>other_config : flow-restore-wait</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              When <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>starts up, it has an empty flow table
              and therefore it handles all arriving packets in its
              default fashion according to its configuration, by
              dropping them or sending them to an OpenFlow controller or
              switching them as a standalone switch. This behavior is
              ordinarily desirable. However, if <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is
              restarting as part of a ``hot-upgrade,’’ then this leads
              to a relatively long period during which packets are
              mishandled.

              This option allows for improvement. When <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
              starts with this value set as <b>true</b>, it will neither flush
              or expire previously set datapath flows nor will it send
              and receive any packets to or from the datapath. When this
              value is later set to <b>false</b>, <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>will start
              receiving packets from the datapath and re-setup the
              flows.

              Additionally, <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is prevented from connecting to
              controllers when this value is set to <b>true</b>. This prevents
              controllers from making changes to the flow table in the
              middle of flow restoration, which could result in
              undesirable intermediate states. Once this value has been
              set to <b>false </b>and the desired flow state has been restored,
              <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>will be able to reconnect to controllers and
              process any new flow table modifications.

              Thus, with this option, the procedure for a hot-upgrade of
              <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>becomes roughly the following:

              1.  Stop <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

              2.  Set <b>other_config:flow-restore-wait </b>to <b>true</b>.

              3.  Start <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

              4.  Use <b>ovs-ofctl </b>(or some other program, such as an
                  OpenFlow controller) to restore the OpenFlow flow
                  table to the desired state.

              5.  Set <b>other_config:flow-restore-wait </b>to <b>false </b>(or remove
                  it entirely from the database).

              The <b>ovs-ctl</b>’s ``restart’’ and ``force-reload-kmod’’
              functions use the above config option during hot upgrades.

       <b>other_config : flow-limit</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The maximum number of flows allowed in the datapath flow
              table. Internally OVS will choose a flow limit which will
              likely be lower than this number, based on real time
              network conditions. Tweaking this value is discouraged
              unless you know exactly what you’re doing.

              The default is 200000.

       <b>other_config : max-idle</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 500
              The maximum time (in ms) that idle flows will remain
              cached in the datapath. Internally OVS will check the
              validity and activity for datapath flows regularly and may
              expire flows quicker than this number, based on real time
              network conditions. Tweaking this value is discouraged
              unless you know exactly what you’re doing.

              The default is 10000.

       <b>other_config : max-revalidator</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 100
              The maximum time (in ms) that revalidator threads will
              wait before executing flow revalidation. Note that this is
              maximum allowed value. Actual timeout used by OVS is
              minimum of max-idle and max-revalidator values. Tweaking
              this value is discouraged unless you know exactly what
              you’re doing.

              The default is 500.

       <b>other_config : min-revalidate-pps</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Set minimum pps that flow must have in order to be
              revalidated when revalidation duration exceeds half of
              max-revalidator config variable. Setting to 0 means always
              revalidate flows regardless of pps.

              The default is 5.

       <b>other_config : offloaded-stats-delay</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, at least 0
              Set worst case delay (in ms) it might take before
              statistics of offloaded flows are updated. Offloaded flows
              younger than this delay will always be revalidated
              regardless of <b>other_config:min-revalidate-pps</b>.

              The default is 2000.

       <b>other_config : hw-offload</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Set this value to <b>true </b>to enable netdev flow offload.

              The default value is <b>false</b>. Changing this value requires
              restarting the daemon

              Currently Open vSwitch supports hardware offloading on
              Linux systems. On other systems, this value is ignored.
              This functionality is considered ’experimental’. Depending
              on which OpenFlow matches and actions are configured,
              which kernel version is used, and what hardware is
              available, Open vSwitch may not be able to offload
              functionality to hardware.

              In order to dump HW offloaded flows use <b>ovs-appctl</b>
              <b>dpctl/dump-flows</b>, <b>ovs-dpctl </b>doesn’t support this
              functionality. See ovs-vswitchd(8) for details.

       <b>other_config : n-offload-threads</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 10
              Set this value to the number of threads created to manage
              hardware offloads.

              The default value is <b>1</b>. Changing this value requires
              restarting the daemon.

              This is only relevant for userspace datapath and only if
              <b>other_config:hw-offload </b>is enabled.

       <b>other_config : tc-policy</b>: optional string, one of <b>none</b>, <b>skip_hw</b>,
       or <b>skip_sw</b>
              Specified the policy used with HW offloading. Options:

              <b>none   </b>Add software rule and offload rule to HW.

              <b>skip_sw</b>
                     Offload rule to HW only.

              <b>skip_hw</b>
                     Add software rule without offloading rule to HW.

              This is only relevant if <b>other_config:hw-offload </b>is
              enabled.

              The default value is <b>none</b>.

       <b>other_config : dpdk-init</b>: optional string, one of <b>false</b>, <b>true</b>, or
       <b>try</b>
              Set this value to <b>true </b>or <b>try </b>to enable runtime support
              for DPDK ports. The vswitch must have compile-time support
              for DPDK as well.

              A value of <b>true </b>will cause the ovs-vswitchd process to
              abort if DPDK cannot be initialized. A value of <b>try </b>will
              allow the ovs-vswitchd process to continue running even if
              DPDK cannot be initialized.

              The default value is <b>false</b>. Changing this value requires
              restarting the daemon

              If this value is <b>false </b>at startup, any dpdk ports which
              are configured in the bridge will fail due to memory
              errors.

       <b>other_config : dpdk-lcore-mask</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 1
              Specifies the CPU cores where dpdk lcore threads should be
              spawned. The DPDK lcore threads are used for DPDK library
              tasks, such as library internal message processing,
              logging, etc. Value should be in the form of a hex string
              (so ’0x123’) similar to the ’taskset’ mask input.

              The lowest order bit corresponds to the first CPU core. A
              set bit means the corresponding core is available and an
              lcore thread will be created and pinned to it. If the
              input does not cover all cores, those uncovered cores are
              considered not set.

              For performance reasons, it is best to set this to a
              single core on the system, rather than allow lcore threads
              to float.

              If not specified, the value will be determined by choosing
              the lowest CPU core from initial cpu affinity list.
              Otherwise, the value will be passed directly to the DPDK
              library.

       <b>other_config : pmd-cpu-mask</b>: optional string
              Specifies CPU mask for setting the cpu affinity of PMD
              (Poll Mode Driver) threads. Value should be in the form of
              hex string, similar to the dpdk EAL ’-c COREMASK’ option
              input or the ’taskset’ mask input.

              The lowest order bit corresponds to the first CPU core. A
              set bit means the corresponding core is available and a
              pmd thread will be created and pinned to it. If the input
              does not cover all cores, those uncovered cores are
              considered not set.

              If not specified, one pmd thread will be created for each
              numa node and pinned to any available core on the numa
              node by default.

       <b>other_config : dpdk-alloc-mem</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Specifies the amount of memory to preallocate from the
              hugepage pool, regardless of socket. It is recommended
              that dpdk-socket-mem is used instead.

       <b>other_config : dpdk-socket-mem</b>: optional string
              Specifies the amount of memory to preallocate from the
              hugepage pool, on a per-socket basis.

              The specifier is a comma-separated string, in ascending
              order of CPU socket. E.g. On a four socket system
              1024,0,2048 would set socket 0 to preallocate 1024MB,
              socket 1 to preallocate 0MB, socket 2 to preallocate
              2048MB and socket 3 (no value given) to preallocate 0MB.

              If <b>other_config:dpdk-socket-mem </b>and <b>other_config:dpdk-</b>
              <b>alloc-mem </b>are not specified, neither will be used and
              there will be no default value for each numa node. DPDK
              defaults will be used instead. If <b>other_config:dpdk-</b>
              <b>socket-mem </b>and <b>other_config:dpdk-alloc-mem </b>are specified
              at the same time, <b>other_config:dpdk-socket-mem </b>will be
              used as default. Changing this value requires restarting
              the daemon.

       <b>other_config : dpdk-socket-limit</b>: optional string
              Limits the maximum amount of memory that can be used from
              the hugepage pool, on a per-socket basis.

              The specifier is a comma-separated list of memory limits
              per socket. <b>0 </b>will disable the limit for a particular
              socket.

              If not specified, OVS will not configure limits by
              default. Changing this value requires restarting the
              daemon.

       <b>other_config : dpdk-hugepage-dir</b>: optional string
              Specifies the path to the hugetlbfs mount point.

              If not specified, this will be guessed by the DPDK library
              (default is /dev/hugepages). Changing this value requires
              restarting the daemon.

       <b>other_config : dpdk-extra</b>: optional string
              Specifies additional eal command line arguments for DPDK.

              The default is empty. Changing this value requires
              restarting the daemon

       <b>other_config : vhost-sock-dir</b>: optional string
              Specifies a relative path from <b>external_ids:rundir </b>to the
              vhost-user unix domain socket files. If this value is
              unset, the sockets are put directly in
              <b>external_ids:rundir</b>.

              Changing this value requires restarting the daemon.

       <b>other_config : vhost-iommu-support</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b>
       or <b>false</b>
              vHost IOMMU is a security feature, which restricts the
              vhost memory that a virtio device may access. vHost IOMMU
              support is disabled by default, due to a bug in QEMU
              implementations of the vhost REPLY_ACK protocol, (on which
              vHost IOMMU relies) prior to v2.9.1. Setting this value to
              <b>true </b>enables vHost IOMMU support for vHost User Client
              ports in OvS-DPDK, starting from DPDK v17.11.

              Changing this value requires restarting the daemon.

       <b>other_config : vhost-postcopy-support</b>: optional string, either
       <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              vHost post-copy is a feature which allows switching live
              migration of VM attached to dpdkvhostuserclient port to
              post-copy mode if default pre-copy migration can not be
              converged or takes too long to converge. Setting this
              value to <b>true </b>enables vHost post-copy support for all
              dpdkvhostuserclient ports. Available starting from DPDK
              v18.11 and QEMU 2.12.

              Changing this value requires restarting the daemon.

       <b>other_config : per-port-memory</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              By default OVS DPDK uses a shared memory model wherein
              devices that have the same MTU and socket values can share
              the same mempool. Setting this value to <b>true </b>changes this
              behaviour. Per port memory allow DPDK devices to use
              private memory per device. This can provide greater
              transparency as regards memory usage but potentially at
              the cost of greater memory requirements.

              Changing this value requires restarting the daemon if
              dpdk-init has already been set to true.

       <b>other_config : shared-mempool-config</b>: optional string
              Specifies dpdk shared mempool config.

              Value should be set in the following form:

              <b>other_config:shared-mempool-config=&lt;</b>
              <b>user-shared-mempool-mtu-list&gt;</b>

              where

              •      &lt;user-shared-mempool-mtu-list&gt; ::= NULL | &lt;non-
                     empty-list&gt;

              •      &lt;non-empty-list&gt; ::= &lt;user-mtus&gt; | &lt;user-mtus&gt; ,
                     &lt;non-empty-list&gt;

              •      &lt;user-mtus&gt; ::= &lt;mtu-all-socket&gt; | &lt;mtu-socket-
                     pair&gt;

              •      &lt;mtu-all-socket&gt; ::= &lt;mtu&gt;

              •      &lt;mtu-socket-pair&gt; ::= &lt;mtu&gt; : &lt;socket-id&gt;

              Changing this value requires restarting the daemon if
              dpdk-init has already been set to true.

       <b>other_config : tx-flush-interval</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 1,000,000
              Specifies the time in microseconds that a packet can wait
              in output batch for sending i.e. amount of time that
              packet can spend in an intermediate output queue before
              sending to netdev. This option can be used to configure
              balance between throughput and latency. Lower values
              decreases latency while higher values may be useful to
              achieve higher performance.

              Defaults to 0 i.e. instant packet sending (latency
              optimized).

       <b>other_config : pmd-perf-metrics</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Enables recording of detailed PMD performance metrics for
              analysis and trouble-shooting. This can have a performance
              impact in the order of 1%.

              Defaults to false but can be changed at any time.

       <b>other_config : smc-enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Signature match cache or SMC is a cache between EMC and
              megaflow cache. It does not store the full key of the
              flow, so it is more memory efficient comparing to EMC
              cache. SMC is especially useful when flow count is larger
              than EMC capacity.

              Defaults to false but can be changed at any time.

       <b>other_config : pmd-rxq-assign</b>: optional string, one of <b>cycles</b>,
       <b>group</b>, or <b>roundrobin</b>
              Specifies how RX queues will be automatically assigned to
              CPU cores. Options:

              <b>cycles </b>Rxqs will be sorted by order of measured processing
                     cycles before being assigned to CPU cores.

              <b>roundrobin</b>
                     Rxqs will be round-robined across CPU cores.

              <b>group  </b>Rxqs will be sorted by order of measured processing
                     cycles before being assigned to CPU cores with
                     lowest estimated load.

              The default value is <b>cycles</b>.

              Changing this value will affect an automatic re-assignment
              of Rxqs to CPUs. Note: Rxqs mapped to CPU cores with
              <b>pmd-rxq-affinity </b>are unaffected.

       <b>other_config : pmd-rxq-isolate</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Specifies if a CPU core will be isolated after being
              pinned with an Rx queue.

              Set this value to <b>false </b>to non-isolate a CPU core after it
              is pinned with an Rxq using <b>pmd-rxq-affinity</b>. This will
              allow OVS to assign other Rxqs to that CPU core.

              The default value is <b>true</b>.

              This can only be <b>false </b>when <b>pmd-rxq-assign </b>is set to
              <b>group</b>.

       <b>other_config : n-handler-threads</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 1
              Attempts to specify the number of threads for software
              datapaths to use for handling new flows. Some datapaths
              may choose to ignore this and it will be set to a sensible
              option for the datapath type.

              This configuration is per datapath. If you have more than
              one software datapath (e.g. some <b>system </b>bridges and some
              <b>netdev </b>bridges), then the total number of threads is
              <b>n-handler-threads </b>times the number of software datapaths.

       <b>other_config : n-revalidator-threads</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, at least 1
              Attempts to specify the number of threads for software
              datapaths to use for revalidating flows in the datapath.
              Some datapaths may choose to ignore this and will set to a
              sensible option for the datapath type.

              Typically, there is a direct correlation between the
              number of revalidator threads, and the number of flows
              allowed in the datapath. The default is the number of cpu
              cores divided by four plus one. If <b>n-handler-threads </b>is
              set, the default changes to the number of cpu cores minus
              the number of handler threads.

              This configuration is per datapath. If you have more than
              one software datapath (e.g. some <b>system </b>bridges and some
              <b>netdev </b>bridges), then the total number of threads is
              <b>n-handler-threads </b>times the number of software datapaths.

       <b>other_config : emc-insert-inv-prob</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              Specifies the inverse probability (1/emc-insert-inv-prob)
              of a flow being inserted into the Exact Match Cache (EMC).
              On average one in every <b>emc-insert-inv-prob </b>packets that
              generate a unique flow will cause an insertion into the
              EMC. A value of 1 will result in an insertion for every
              flow (1/1 = 100%) whereas a value of zero will result in
              no insertions and essentially disable the EMC.

              Defaults to 100 ie. there is (1/100 =) 1% chance of EMC
              insertion.

       <b>other_config : vlan-limit</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Limits the number of VLAN headers that can be matched to
              the specified number. Further VLAN headers will be treated
              as payload, e.g. a packet with more 802.1q headers will
              match Ethernet type 0x8100.

              Open vSwitch userspace currently supports at most 2 VLANs,
              and each datapath has its own limit. If <b>vlan-limit </b>is
              nonzero, it acts as a further limit.

              If this value is absent, the default is currently 1. This
              maintains backward compatibility with controllers that
              were designed for use with Open vSwitch versions earlier
              than 2.8, which only supported one VLAN.

       <b>other_config : bundle-idle-timeout</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, at least 1
              The maximum time (in seconds) that idle bundles will wait
              to be expired since it was either opened, modified or
              closed.

              OpenFlow specification mandates the timeout to be at least
              one second. The default is 10 seconds.

       <b>other_config : offload-rebalance</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Configures HW offload rebalancing, that allows to
              dynamically offload and un-offload flows while an offload-
              device is out of resources (OOR). This policy allows flows
              to be selected for offloading based on the packets-per-
              second (pps) rate of flows.

              Set this value to <b>true </b>to enable this option.

              The default value is <b>false</b>. Changing this value requires
              restarting the daemon.

              This is only relevant if HW offloading is enabled (hw-
              offload). When this policy is enabled, it also requires
              ’tc-policy’ to be set to ’skip_sw’.

       <b>other_config : pmd-auto-lb</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Configures PMD Auto Load Balancing that allows automatic
              assignment of RX queues to PMDs if any of PMDs is
              overloaded (i.e. a processing cycles &gt; <b>other_config:pmd-</b>
              <b>auto-lb-load-threshold</b>).

              It uses current scheme of cycle based assignment of RX
              queues that are not statically pinned to PMDs.

              The default value is <b>false</b>.

              Set this value to <b>true </b>to enable this option. It is
              currently disabled by default and an experimental feature.

              This only comes in effect if cycle based assignment is
              enabled and there are more than one non-isolated PMDs
              present and at least one of it polls more than one queue.

       <b>other_config : pmd-auto-lb-rebal-interval</b>: optional string,
       containing an integer, in range 0 to 20,000
              The minimum time (in minutes) 2 consecutive PMD Auto Load
              Balancing iterations.

              The default value is 1 min. If configured to 0 then it
              would be converted to default value i.e. 1 min

              This option can be configured to avoid frequent trigger of
              auto load balancing of PMDs. For e.g. set the value (in
              min) such that it occurs once in few hours or a day or a
              week.

       <b>other_config : pmd-auto-lb-load-threshold</b>: optional string,
       containing an integer, in range 0 to 100
              Specifies the minimum PMD thread load threshold (% of used
              cycles) of any non-isolated PMD threads when a PMD Auto
              Load Balance may be triggered.

              The default value is <b>95%</b>.

       <b>other_config : pmd-auto-lb-improvement-threshold</b>: optional
       string, containing an integer, in range 0 to 100
              Specifies the minimum evaluated % improvement in load
              distribution across the non-isolated PMD threads that will
              allow a PMD Auto Load Balance to occur.

              Note, setting this parameter to 0 will always allow an
              auto load balance to occur regardless of estimated
              improvement or not.

              The default value is <b>25%</b>.

       <b>other_config : pmd-sleep-max</b>: optional string
              Specifies the maximum sleep time that will be requested in
              microseconds per iteration for a PMD thread which has
              received zero or a small amount of packets from the Rx
              queues it is polling.

              The actual sleep time requested is based on the load of
              the Rx queues that the PMD polls and may be less than the
              maximum value.

              The default value is <b>0 microseconds</b>, which means that the
              PMD will not sleep regardless of the load from the Rx
              queues that it polls.

              The maximum value is <b>10000 microseconds</b>.

              <b>other_config:pmd-sleep-max=&lt;pmd-sleep-list&gt;</b>

              where

              •      &lt;pmd-sleep-list&gt; ::= NULL | &lt;non-empty-list&gt;

              •      &lt;non-empty-list&gt; ::= &lt;pmd-sleep-value&gt; | &lt;pmd-
                     sleep-value&gt; , &lt;non-empty-list&gt;

              •      &lt;pmd-sleep-value&gt; ::= &lt;global-default-sleep-value&gt;
                     | &lt;pmd-core-sleep-pair&gt;

              •      &lt;global-default-sleep-value&gt; ::= &lt;max-sleep-time&gt;

              •      &lt;pmd-core-sleep-pair&gt; ::= &lt;core&gt; : &lt;max-sleep-time&gt;

       <b>other_config : userspace-tso-enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b>
       or <b>false</b>
              Set this value to <b>true </b>to enable userspace support for TCP
              Segmentation Offloading (TSO). When it is enabled, the
              interfaces can provide an oversized TCP segment to the
              datapath and the datapath will offload the TCP
              segmentation and checksum calculation to the interfaces
              when necessary.

              The default value is <b>false</b>. Changing this value requires
              restarting the daemon.

              The feature only works if Open vSwitch is built with DPDK
              support.

              The feature is considered experimental.

     <i>Status:</i>

       <b>next_cfg</b>: integer
              Sequence number for client to increment. When a client
              modifies any part of the database configuration and wishes
              to wait for Open vSwitch to finish applying the changes,
              it may increment this sequence number.

       <b>cur_cfg</b>: integer
              Sequence number that Open vSwitch sets to the current
              value of <b>next_cfg </b>after it finishes applying a set of
              configuration changes.

       <b>dpdk_initialized</b>: boolean
              True if <b>other_config:dpdk-init </b>is set to true and the DPDK
              library is successfully initialized.

     <i>Statistics:</i>

       The <b>statistics </b>column contains key-value pairs that report
       statistics about a system running an Open vSwitch. These are
       updated periodically (currently, every 5 seconds). Key-value
       pairs that cannot be determined or that do not apply to a
       platform are omitted.

       <b>other_config : enable-statistics</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Statistics are disabled by default to avoid overhead in
              the common case when statistics gathering is not useful.
              Set this value to <b>true </b>to enable populating the <b>statistics</b>
              column or to <b>false </b>to explicitly disable it.

       <b>statistics : cpu</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 1
              Number of CPU processors, threads, or cores currently
              online and available to the operating system on which Open
              vSwitch is running, as an integer. This may be less than
              the number installed, if some are not online or if they
              are not available to the operating system.

              Open vSwitch userspace processes are not multithreaded,
              but the Linux kernel-based datapath is.

       <b>statistics : load_average</b>: optional string
              A comma-separated list of three floating-point numbers,
              representing the system load average over the last 1, 5,
              and 15 minutes, respectively.

       <b>statistics : memory</b>: optional string
              A comma-separated list of integers, each of which
              represents a quantity of memory in kilobytes that
              describes the operating system on which Open vSwitch is
              running. In respective order, these values are:

              1.  Total amount of RAM allocated to the OS.

              2.  RAM allocated to the OS that is in use.

              3.  RAM that can be flushed out to disk or otherwise
                  discarded if that space is needed for another purpose.
                  This number is necessarily less than or equal to the
                  previous value.

              4.  Total disk space allocated for swap.

              5.  Swap space currently in use.

              On Linux, all five values can be determined and are
              included. On other operating systems, only the first two
              values can be determined, so the list will only have two
              values.

       <b>statistics : process_NAME</b>: optional string
              One such key-value pair, with <b>NAME </b>replaced by a process
              name, will exist for each running Open vSwitch daemon
              process, with <i>name</i> replaced by the daemon’s name (e.g.
              <b>process_ovs-vswitchd</b>). The value is a comma-separated list
              of integers. The integers represent the following, with
              memory measured in kilobytes and durations in
              milliseconds:

              1.  The process’s virtual memory size.

              2.  The process’s resident set size.

              3.  The amount of user and system CPU time consumed by the
                  process.

              4.  The number of times that the process has crashed and
                  been automatically restarted by the monitor.

              5.  The duration since the process was started.

              6.  The duration for which the process has been running.

              The interpretation of some of these values depends on
              whether the process was started with the <b>--monitor</b>. If it
              was not, then the crash count will always be 0 and the two
              durations will always be the same. If <b>--monitor </b>was given,
              then the crash count may be positive; if it is, the latter
              duration is the amount of time since the most recent crash
              and restart.

              There will be one key-value pair for each file in Open
              vSwitch’s ``run directory’’ (usually <b>/var/run/openvswitch</b>)
              whose name ends in <b>.pid</b>, whose contents are a process ID,
              and which is locked by a running process. The <i>name</i> is
              taken from the pidfile’s name.

              Currently Open vSwitch is only able to obtain all of the
              above detail on Linux systems. On other systems, the same
              key-value pairs will be present but the values will always
              be the empty string.

       <b>statistics : file_systems</b>: optional string
              A space-separated list of information on local, writable
              file systems. Each item in the list describes one file
              system and consists in turn of a comma-separated list of
              the following:

              1.  Mount point, e.g. <b>/ </b>or <b>/var/log</b>. Any spaces or commas
                  in the mount point are replaced by underscores.

              2.  Total size, in kilobytes, as an integer.

              3.  Amount of storage in use, in kilobytes, as an integer.

              This key-value pair is omitted if there are no local,
              writable file systems or if Open vSwitch cannot obtain the
              needed information.

     <i>Version Reporting:</i>

       These columns report the types and versions of the hardware and
       software running Open vSwitch. We recommend in general that
       software should test whether specific features are supported
       instead of relying on version number checks. These values are
       primarily intended for reporting to human administrators.

       <b>ovs_version</b>: optional string
              The Open vSwitch version number, e.g. <b>1.1.0</b>.

       <b>db_version</b>: optional string
              The database schema version number, e.g. <b>1.2.3</b>. See ovsdb-
              tool(1) for an explanation of the numbering scheme.

              The schema version is part of the database schema, so it
              can also be retrieved by fetching the schema using the
              Open vSwitch database protocol.

       <b>system_type</b>: optional string
              An identifier for the type of system on top of which Open
              vSwitch runs, e.g. <b>KVM</b>.

              System integrators are responsible for choosing and
              setting an appropriate value for this column.

       <b>system_version</b>: optional string
              The version of the system identified by <b>system_type</b>, e.g.
              <b>4.18.0-372.19.1.el8_6 </b>on RHEL 8.6 with kernel
              4.18.0-372.19.1.

              System integrators are responsible for choosing and
              setting an appropriate value for this column.

       <b>dpdk_version</b>: optional string
              The version of the linked DPDK library.

     <i>Capabilities:</i>

       These columns report capabilities of the Open vSwitch instance.

       <b>datapath_types</b>: set of strings
              This column reports the different dpifs registered with
              the system. These are the values that this instance
              supports in the <b>datapath_type </b>column of the <b>Bridge </b>table.

       <b>iface_types</b>: set of strings
              This column reports the different netdevs registered with
              the system. These are the values that this instance
              supports in the <b>type </b>column of the <b>Interface </b>table.

     <i>Database Configuration:</i>

       These columns primarily configure the Open vSwitch database
       (<b>ovsdb-server</b>), not the Open vSwitch switch (<b>ovs-vswitchd</b>). The
       OVSDB database also uses the <b>ssl </b>settings.

       The Open vSwitch switch does read the database configuration to
       determine remote IP addresses to which in-band control should
       apply.

       <b>manager_options</b>: set of <b>Manager</b>s
              Database clients to which the Open vSwitch database server
              should connect or to which it should listen, along with
              options for how these connections should be configured.
              See the <b>Manager </b>table for more information.

              For this column to serve its purpose, <b>ovsdb-server </b>must be
              configured to honor it. The easiest way to do this is to
              invoke <b>ovsdb-server </b>with the option
              <b>--remote=db:Open_vSwitch,Open_vSwitch,manager_options </b>The
              startup scripts that accompany Open vSwitch do this by
              default.

     <i>IPsec:</i>

       These settings control the global configuration of IPsec tunnels.
       The <b>options </b>column of the <b>Interface </b>table configures IPsec for
       individual tunnels. The <b>options </b>column also allows for custom
       options prefixed with <b>ipsec_ </b>to be passed to the individual
       connections.

       OVS IPsec supports the following three forms of authentication.
       Currently, all IPsec tunnels must use the same form:

              1.  Pre-shared keys: Omit the global settings. On each
                  tunnel, set <b>options:psk</b>.

              2.  Self-signed certificates: Set the <b>private_key </b>and
                  <b>certificate </b>global settings. On each tunnel, set
                  <b>options:remote_cert</b>. The remote certificate can be
                  self-signed.

              3.  CA-signed certificates: Set all of the global
                  settings. On each tunnel, set <b>options:remote_name </b>to
                  the common name (CN) of the remote certificate. The
                  remote certificate must be signed by the CA.

       <b>other_config : private_key</b>: optional string
              Name of a PEM file containing the private key used as the
              switch’s identity for IPsec tunnels.

       <b>other_config : certificate</b>: optional string
              Name of a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies
              the switch’s private key, and identifies a trustworthy
              switch for IPsec tunnels. The certificate must be x.509
              version 3 and with the string in common name (CN) also set
              in the subject alternative name (SAN).

       <b>other_config : ca_cert</b>: optional string
              Name of a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to
              verify that a remote switch of the IPsec tunnel is
              trustworthy.

     <i>Plaintext Tunnel Policy:</i>

       When an IPsec tunnel is configured in this database, multiple
       independent components take responsibility for implementing it.
       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>and its datapath handle packet forwarding to the
       tunnel and a separate daemon pushes the tunnel’s IPsec policy
       configuration to the kernel or other entity that implements it.
       There is a race: if the former configuration completes before the
       latter, then packets sent by the local host over the tunnel can
       be transmitted in plaintext. Using this setting, OVS users can
       avoid this undesirable situation.

       <b>other_config : ipsec_skb_mark</b>: optional string
              This setting takes the form <i>value</i><b>/</b><i>mask</i>. If it is
              specified, then the <b>skb_mark </b>field in every outgoing
              tunneled packet sent in plaintext is compared against it
              and, if it matches, the packet is dropped. This is a
              global setting that is applied to every tunneled packet,
              regardless of whether IPsec encryption is enabled for the
              tunnel, the type of tunnel, or whether OVS is involved.

              Example policies:

              <b>1/1    </b>Drop all unencrypted tunneled packets in which the
                     least-significant bit of <b>skb_mark </b>is 1. This would
                     be a useful policy given an OpenFlow flow table
                     that sets <b>skb_mark </b>to 1 for traffic that should be
                     encrypted. The default <b>skb_mark </b>is 0, so this would
                     not affect other traffic.

              <b>0/1    </b>Drop all unencrypted tunneled packets in which the
                     least-significant bit of <b>skb_mark </b>is 0. This would
                     be a useful policy if no unencrypted tunneled
                     traffic should exit the system without being
                     specially permitted by setting <b>skb_mark </b>to 1.

              (empty)
                     If this setting is empty or unset, then all
                     unencrypted tunneled packets are transmitted in the
                     usual way.

   <b>Details:</b>
     <i>Core Features:</i>

       <b>name</b>: immutable string (must be unique within table)
              Bridge identifier. Must be unique among the names of
              ports, interfaces, and bridges on a host.

              The name must be alphanumeric and must not contain forward
              or backward slashes. The name of a bridge is also the name
              of an <b>Interface </b>(and a <b>Port</b>) within the bridge, so the
              restrictions on the <b>name </b>column in the <b>Interface </b>table,
              particularly on length, also apply to bridge names. Refer
              to the documentation for <b>Interface </b>names for details.

       <b>ports</b>: set of <b>Port</b>s
              Ports included in the bridge.

       <b>mirrors</b>: set of <b>Mirror</b>s
              Port mirroring configuration.

       <b>netflow</b>: optional <b>NetFlow</b>
              NetFlow configuration.

       <b>sflow</b>: optional <b>sFlow</b>
              sFlow(R) configuration.

       <b>ipfix</b>: optional <b>IPFIX</b>
              IPFIX configuration.

       <b>flood_vlans</b>: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              VLAN IDs of VLANs on which MAC address learning should be
              disabled, so that packets are flooded instead of being
              sent to specific ports that are believed to contain
              packets’ destination MACs. This should ordinarily be used
              to disable MAC learning on VLANs used for mirroring (RSPAN
              VLANs). It may also be useful for debugging.

              SLB bonding (see the <b>bond_mode </b>column in the <b>Port </b>table)
              is incompatible with <b>flood_vlans</b>. Consider using another
              bonding mode or a different type of mirror instead.

       <b>auto_attach</b>: optional <b>AutoAttach</b>
              Auto Attach configuration.

     <i>OpenFlow Configuration:</i>

       <b>controller</b>: set of <b>Controller</b>s
              OpenFlow controller set. If unset, then no OpenFlow
              controllers will be used.

              If there are primary controllers, removing all of them
              clears the OpenFlow flow tables, group table, and meter
              table. If there are no primary controllers, adding one
              also clears these tables. Other changes to the set of
              controllers, such as adding or removing a service
              controller, adding another primary controller to
              supplement an existing primary controller, or removing
              only one of two primary controllers, have no effect on
              these tables.

       <b>flow_tables</b>: map of integer-<b>Flow_Table </b>pairs, key in range 0 to
       254
              Configuration for OpenFlow tables. Each pair maps from an
              OpenFlow table ID to configuration for that table.

       <b>fail_mode</b>: optional string, either <b>secure </b>or <b>standalone</b>
              When a controller is configured, it is, ordinarily,
              responsible for setting up all flows on the switch. Thus,
              if the connection to the controller fails, no new network
              connections can be set up. If the connection to the
              controller stays down long enough, no packets can pass
              through the switch at all. This setting determines the
              switch’s response to such a situation. It may be set to
              one of the following:

              <b>standalone</b>
                     If no message is received from the controller for
                     three times the inactivity probe interval (see
                     <b>inactivity_probe</b>), then Open vSwitch will take over
                     responsibility for setting up flows. In this mode,
                     Open vSwitch causes the bridge to act like an
                     ordinary MAC-learning switch. Open vSwitch will
                     continue to retry connecting to the controller in
                     the background and, when the connection succeeds,
                     it will discontinue its standalone behavior.

              <b>secure </b>Open vSwitch will not set up flows on its own when
                     the controller connection fails or when no
                     controllers are defined. The bridge will continue
                     to retry connecting to any defined controllers
                     forever.

              The default is <b>standalone </b>if the value is unset, but
              future versions of Open vSwitch may change the default.

              The <b>standalone </b>mode can create forwarding loops on a
              bridge that has more than one uplink port unless STP is
              enabled. To avoid loops on such a bridge, configure <b>secure</b>
              mode or enable STP (see <b>stp_enable</b>).

              The <b>fail_mode </b>setting applies only to primary controllers.
              When more than one primary controller is configured,
              <b>fail_mode </b>is considered only when none of the configured
              controllers can be contacted.

              Changing <b>fail_mode </b>when no primary controllers are
              configured clears the OpenFlow flow tables, group table,
              and meter table.

       <b>datapath_id</b>: optional string
              Reports the OpenFlow datapath ID in use. Exactly 16 hex
              digits. (Setting this column has no useful effect. Set
              <b>other-config:datapath-id </b>instead.)

       <b>datapath_version</b>: string
              Reports the datapath version. This column is maintained
              for backwards compatibility. The preferred locatation is
              the <b>datapath_id </b>column of the <b>Datapath </b>table. The full
              documentation for this column is there.

       <b>other_config : datapath-id</b>: optional string
              Overrides the default OpenFlow datapath ID, setting it to
              the specified value specified in hex. The value must
              either have a <b>0x </b>prefix or be exactly 16 hex digits long.
              May not be all-zero.

       <b>other_config : dp-desc</b>: optional string
              Human readable description of datapath. It is a maximum
              256 byte-long free-form string to describe the datapath
              for debugging purposes, e.g. <b>switch3 in room 3120</b>. The
              value is returned by the switch as a part of reply to
              OFPMP_DESC request (ofp_desc). The OpenFlow specification
              (e.g. 1.3.5) describes the ofp_desc structure to contaion
              "NULL terminated ASCII strings". For the compatibility
              reasons no more than 255 ASCII characters should be used.

       <b>other_config : dp-sn</b>: optional string
              Serial number. It is a maximum 32 byte-long free-form
              string to provide an additional switch identification. The
              value is returned by the switch as a part of reply to
              OFPMP_DESC request (ofp_desc). Same as mentioned in the
              description of <b>other-config:dp-desc</b>, the string should be
              no more than 31 ASCII characters for the compatibility.

       <b>other_config : disable-in-band</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, disable in-band control on the bridge
              regardless of controller and manager settings.

       <b>other_config : in-band-queue</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              A queue ID as a nonnegative integer. This sets the
              OpenFlow queue ID that will be used by flows set up by in-
              band control on this bridge. If unset, or if the port used
              by an in-band control flow does not have QoS configured,
              or if the port does not have a queue with the specified
              ID, the default queue is used instead.

       <b>other_config : controller-queue-size</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, in range 1 to 512
              This sets the maximum size of the queue of packets that
              need to be sent to the OpenFlow management controller. The
              value must be less than 512. If not specified the queue
              size is limited to 100 packets by default. Note:
              increasing the queue size might have a negative impact on
              latency.

       <b>protocols</b>: set of strings, one of <b>OpenFlow10</b>, <b>OpenFlow11</b>,
       <b>OpenFlow12</b>, <b>OpenFlow13</b>, <b>OpenFlow14</b>, or <b>OpenFlow15</b>
              List of OpenFlow protocols that may be used when
              negotiating a connection with a controller. OpenFlow 1.0,
              1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 are enabled by default if this
              column is empty.

     <i>Spanning Tree Configuration:</i>

       The IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network
       protocol that ensures loop-free topologies. It allows redundant
       links to be included in the network to provide automatic backup
       paths if the active links fails.

       These settings configure the slower-to-converge but still widely
       supported version of Spanning Tree Protocol, sometimes known as
       802.1D-1998. Open vSwitch also supports the newer Rapid Spanning
       Tree Protocol (RSTP), documented later in the section titled
       <b>Rapid Spanning Tree Configuration</b>.

     <i>STP Configuration:</i>

       <b>stp_enable</b>: boolean
              Enable spanning tree on the bridge. By default, STP is
              disabled on bridges. Bond, internal, and mirror ports are
              not supported and will not participate in the spanning
              tree.

              STP and RSTP are mutually exclusive. If both are enabled,
              RSTP will be used.

       <b>other_config : stp-system-id</b>: optional string
              The bridge’s STP identifier (the lower 48 bits of the
              bridge-id) in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>. By default, the
              identifier is the MAC address of the bridge.

       <b>other_config : stp-priority</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 65,535
              The bridge’s relative priority value for determining the
              root bridge (the upper 16 bits of the bridge-id). A bridge
              with the lowest bridge-id is elected the root. By default,
              the priority is 0x8000.

       <b>other_config : stp-hello-time</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 10
              The interval between transmissions of hello messages by
              designated ports, in seconds. By default the hello
              interval is 2 seconds.

       <b>other_config : stp-max-age</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 6 to 40
              The maximum age of the information transmitted by the
              bridge when it is the root bridge, in seconds. By default,
              the maximum age is 20 seconds.

       <b>other_config : stp-forward-delay</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 4 to 30
              The delay to wait between transitioning root and
              designated ports to <b>forwarding</b>, in seconds. By default,
              the forwarding delay is 15 seconds.

       <b>other_config : mcast-snooping-aging-time</b>: optional string,
       containing an integer, at least 1
              The maximum number of seconds to retain a multicast
              snooping entry for which no packets have been seen. The
              default is currently 300 seconds (5 minutes). The value,
              if specified, is forced into a reasonable range, currently
              15 to 3600 seconds.

       <b>other_config : mcast-snooping-table-size</b>: optional string,
       containing an integer, at least 1
              The maximum number of multicast snooping addresses to
              learn. The default is currently 2048. The value, if
              specified, is forced into a reasonable range, currently 10
              to 1,000,000.

       <b>other_config : mcast-snooping-disable-flood-unregistered</b>:
       optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>false</b>, unregistered multicast packets are
              forwarded to all ports. If set to <b>true</b>, unregistered
              multicast packets are forwarded to ports connected to
              multicast routers.

     <i>STP Status:</i>

       These key-value pairs report the status of 802.1D-1998. They are
       present only if STP is enabled (via the <b>stp_enable </b>column).

       <b>status : stp_bridge_id</b>: optional string
              The bridge ID used in spanning tree advertisements, in the
              form <i>xxxx</i>.<i>yyyyyyyyyyyy</i> where the <i>x</i>s are the STP priority,
              the <i>y</i>s are the STP system ID, and each <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> is a hex
              digit.

       <b>status : stp_designated_root</b>: optional string
              The designated root for this spanning tree, in the same
              form as <b>status:stp_bridge_id</b>. If this bridge is the root,
              this will have the same value as <b>status:stp_bridge_id</b>,
              otherwise it will differ.

       <b>status : stp_root_path_cost</b>: optional string
              The path cost of reaching the designated bridge. A lower
              number is better. The value is 0 if this bridge is the
              root, otherwise it is higher.

     <i>Rapid Spanning Tree:</i>

       Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP), like STP, is a network
       protocol that ensures loop-free topologies. RSTP superseded STP
       with the publication of 802.1D-2004. Compared to STP, RSTP
       converges more quickly and recovers more quickly from failures.

     <i>RSTP Configuration:</i>

       <b>rstp_enable</b>: boolean
              Enable Rapid Spanning Tree on the bridge. By default, RSTP
              is disabled on bridges. Bond, internal, and mirror ports
              are not supported and will not participate in the spanning
              tree.

              STP and RSTP are mutually exclusive. If both are enabled,
              RSTP will be used.

       <b>other_config : rstp-address</b>: optional string
              The bridge’s RSTP address (the lower 48 bits of the
              bridge-id) in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>. By default, the
              address is the MAC address of the bridge.

       <b>other_config : rstp-priority</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 61,440
              The bridge’s relative priority value for determining the
              root bridge (the upper 16 bits of the bridge-id). A bridge
              with the lowest bridge-id is elected the root. By default,
              the priority is 0x8000 (32768). This value needs to be a
              multiple of 4096, otherwise it’s rounded to the nearest
              inferior one.

       <b>other_config : rstp-ageing-time</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 10 to 1,000,000
              The Ageing Time parameter for the Bridge. The default
              value is 300 seconds.

       <b>other_config : rstp-force-protocol-version</b>: optional string,
       containing an integer
              The Force Protocol Version parameter for the Bridge. This
              can take the value 0 (STP Compatibility mode) or 2 (the
              default, normal operation).

       <b>other_config : rstp-max-age</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 6 to 40
              The maximum age of the information transmitted by the
              Bridge when it is the Root Bridge. The default value is
              20.

       <b>other_config : rstp-forward-delay</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 4 to 30
              The delay used by STP Bridges to transition Root and
              Designated Ports to Forwarding. The default value is 15.

       <b>other_config : rstp-transmit-hold-count</b>: optional string,
       containing an integer, in range 1 to 10
              The Transmit Hold Count used by the Port Transmit state
              machine to limit transmission rate. The default value is
              6.

     <i>RSTP Status:</i>

       These key-value pairs report the status of 802.1D-2004. They are
       present only if RSTP is enabled (via the <b>rstp_enable </b>column).

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_bridge_id</b>: optional string
              The bridge ID used in rapid spanning tree advertisements,
              in the form <i>x</i>.<i>yyy</i>.<i>zzzzzzzzzzzz</i> where <i>x</i> is the RSTP
              priority, the <i>y</i>s are a locally assigned system ID
              extension, the <i>z</i>s are the STP system ID, and each <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, or
              <i>z</i> is a hex digit.

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_root_id</b>: optional string
              The root of this spanning tree, in the same form as
              <b>rstp_status:rstp_bridge_id</b>. If this bridge is the root,
              this will have the same value as
              <b>rstp_status:rstp_bridge_id</b>, otherwise it will differ.

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_root_path_cost</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The path cost of reaching the root. A lower number is
              better. The value is 0 if this bridge is the root,
              otherwise it is higher.

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_designated_id</b>: optional string
              The RSTP designated ID, in the same form as
              <b>rstp_status:rstp_bridge_id</b>.

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_bridge_port_id</b>: optional string
              The RSTP bridge port ID, as a 4-digit hex number.

     <i>Multicast Snooping Configuration:</i>

       Multicast snooping (RFC 4541) monitors the Internet Group
       Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery
       traffic between hosts and multicast routers. The switch uses what
       IGMP and MLD snooping learns to forward multicast traffic only to
       interfaces that are connected to interested receivers. Currently
       it supports IGMPv1, IGMPv2, IGMPv3, MLDv1 and MLDv2 protocols.

       <b>mcast_snooping_enable</b>: boolean
              Enable multicast snooping on the bridge. For now, the
              default is disabled.

     <i>Other Features:</i>

       <b>datapath_type</b>: string
              Name of datapath provider. The kernel datapath has type
              <b>system</b>. The userspace datapath has type <b>netdev</b>. A manager
              may refer to the <b>datapath_types </b>column of the <b>Open_vSwitch</b>
              table for a list of the types accepted by this Open
              vSwitch instance.

       <b>external_ids : bridge-id</b>: optional string
              A unique identifier of the bridge.

       <b>other_config : hwaddr</b>: optional string
              An Ethernet address in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i> to set
              the hardware address of the local port and influence the
              datapath ID.

       <b>other_config : forward-bpdu</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Controls forwarding of BPDUs and other network control
              frames when NORMAL action is invoked. When this option is
              <b>false </b>or unset, frames with reserved Ethernet addresses
              (see table below) will not be forwarded. When this option
              is <b>true</b>, such frames will not be treated specially.

              The above general rule has the following exceptions:

              •      If STP is enabled on the bridge (see the <b>stp_enable</b>
                     column in the <b>Bridge </b>table), the bridge processes
                     all received STP packets and never passes them to
                     OpenFlow or forwards them. This is true even if STP
                     is disabled on an individual port.

              •      If LLDP is enabled on an interface (see the <b>lldp</b>
                     column in the <b>Interface </b>table), the interface
                     processes received LLDP packets and never passes
                     them to OpenFlow or forwards them.

              Set this option to <b>true </b>if the Open vSwitch bridge
              connects different Ethernet networks and is not configured
              to participate in STP.

              This option affects packets with the following destination
              MAC addresses:

              to 3600 seconds.

              A short MAC aging time allows a network to more quickly
              detect that a host is no longer connected to a switch
              port. However, it also makes it more likely that packets
              will be flooded unnecessarily, when they are addressed to
              a connected host that rarely transmits packets. To reduce
              the incidence of unnecessary flooding, use a MAC aging
              time longer than the maximum interval at which a host will
              ordinarily transmit packets.

Port TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       A port within a <b>Bridge</b>.

       Most commonly, a port has exactly one ``interface,’’ pointed to
       by its <b>interfaces </b>column. Such a port logically corresponds to a
       port on a physical Ethernet switch. A port with more than one
       interface is a ``bonded port’’ (see <b>Bonding Configuration</b>).

       Some properties that one might think as belonging to a port are
       actually part of the port’s <b>Interface </b>members.

              on a host. Because port and interfaces names are usually
              the same, the restrictions on the <b>name </b>column in the

     <i>VLAN Configuration:</i>

       In short, a VLAN (short for ``virtual LAN’’) is a way to
       partition a single switch into multiple switches. VLANs can be
       confusing, so for an introduction, please refer to the question
       ``What’s a VLAN?’’ in the Open vSwitch FAQ.

       A VLAN is sometimes encoded into a packet using a 802.1Q or
       802.1ad VLAN header, but every packet is part of some VLAN
       whether or not it is encoded in the packet. (A packet that
       appears to have no VLAN is part of VLAN 0, by default.) As a
       result, it’s useful to think of a VLAN as a metadata property of
       a packet, separate from how the VLAN is encoded. For a given
       port, this column determines how the encoding of a packet that
       ingresses or egresses the port maps to the packet’s VLAN. When a
       packet enters the switch, its VLAN is determined based on its
       setting in this column and its VLAN headers, if any, and then,
       conceptually, the VLAN headers are then stripped off. Conversely,
       when a packet exits the switch, its VLAN and the settings in this
       column determine what VLAN headers, if any, are pushed onto the
       packet before it egresses the port.

       The VLAN configuration in this column affects Open vSwitch only
       when it is doing ``normal switching.’’ It does not affect flows
       set up by an OpenFlow controller, outside of the OpenFlow
       ``normal action.’’

       Bridge ports support the following types of VLAN configuration:

              trunk  A trunk port carries packets on one or more
                     specified VLANs specified in the <b>trunks </b>column
                     (often, on every VLAN). A packet that ingresses on
                     a trunk port is in the VLAN specified in its 802.1Q
                     header, or VLAN 0 if the packet has no 802.1Q
                     header. A packet that egresses through a trunk port
                     will have an 802.1Q header if it has a nonzero VLAN
                     ID.

                     Any packet that ingresses on a trunk port tagged
                     with a VLAN that the port does not trunk is
                     dropped.

              access An access port carries packets on exactly one VLAN
                     specified in the <b>tag </b>column. Packets egressing on
                     an access port have no 802.1Q header.

                     Any packet with an 802.1Q header with a nonzero
                     VLAN ID that ingresses on an access port is
                     dropped, regardless of whether the VLAN ID in the
                     header is the access port’s VLAN ID.

              native-tagged
                     A native-tagged port resembles a trunk port, with
                     the exception that a packet without an 802.1Q
                     header that ingresses on a native-tagged port is in
                     the ``native VLAN’’ (specified in the <b>tag </b>column).

              native-untagged
                     A native-untagged port resembles a native-tagged
                     port, with the exception that a packet that
                     egresses on a native-untagged port in the native
                     VLAN will not have an 802.1Q header.

              dot1q-tunnel
                     A dot1q-tunnel port is somewhat like an access
                     port. Like an access port, it carries packets on
                     the single VLAN specified in the <b>tag </b>column and
                     this VLAN, called the service VLAN, does not appear
                     in an 802.1Q header for packets that ingress or
                     egress on the port. The main difference lies in the
                     behavior when packets that include a 802.1Q header
                     ingress on the port. Whereas an access port drops
                     such packets, a dot1q-tunnel port treats these as
                     double-tagged with the outer service VLAN <b>tag </b>and
                     the inner customer VLAN taken from the 802.1Q
                     header. Correspondingly, to egress on the port, a
                     packet outer VLAN (or only VLAN) must be <b>tag</b>, which
                     is removed before egress, which exposes the inner
                     (customer) VLAN if one is present.

                     If <b>cvlans </b>is set, only allows packets in the
                     specified customer VLANs.

       A packet will only egress through bridge ports that carry the
       VLAN of the packet, as described by the rules above.

       <b>vlan_mode</b>: optional string, one of <b>access</b>, <b>dot1q-tunnel</b>,
       <b>native-tagged</b>, <b>native-untagged</b>, or <b>trunk</b>
              The VLAN mode of the port, as described above. When this
              column is empty, a default mode is selected as follows:

              •      If <b>tag </b>contains a value, the port is an access
                     port. The <b>trunks </b>column should be empty.

              •      Otherwise, the port is a trunk port. The <b>trunks</b>
                     column value is honored if it is present.

       <b>tag</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095
              For an access port, the port’s implicitly tagged VLAN. For
              a native-tagged or native-untagged port, the port’s native
              VLAN. Must be empty if this is a trunk port.

       <b>trunks</b>: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              For a trunk, native-tagged, or native-untagged port, the
              802.1Q VLAN or VLANs that this port trunks; if it is
              empty, then the port trunks all VLANs. Must be empty if
              this is an access port.

              A native-tagged or native-untagged port always trunks its
              native VLAN, regardless of whether <b>trunks </b>includes that
              VLAN.

       <b>cvlans</b>: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              For a dot1q-tunnel port, the customer VLANs that this port
              includes. If this is empty, the port includes all customer
              VLANs.

              For other kinds of ports, this setting is ignored.

       <b>other_config : qinq-ethtype</b>: optional string, either <b>802.1ad </b>or
       <b>802.1q</b>
              For a dot1q-tunnel port, this is the TPID for the service
              tag, that is, for the 802.1Q header that contains the
              service VLAN ID. Because packets that actually ingress and
              egress a dot1q-tunnel port do not include an 802.1Q header
              for the service VLAN, this does not affect packets on the
              dot1q-tunnel port itself. Rather, it determines the
              service VLAN for a packet that ingresses on a dot1q-tunnel
              port and egresses on a trunk port.

              The value <b>802.1ad </b>specifies TPID 0x88a8, which is also the
              default if the setting is omitted. The value <b>802.1q</b>
              specifies TPID 0x8100.

              For other kinds of ports, this setting is ignored.

       <b>other_config : priority-tags</b>: optional string, one of <b>always</b>,
       <b>if-nonzero</b>, or <b>never</b>
              An 802.1Q header contains two important pieces of
              information: a VLAN ID and a priority. A frame with a zero
              VLAN ID, called a ``priority-tagged’’ frame, is supposed
              to be treated the same way as a frame without an 802.1Q
              header at all (except for the priority).

              However, some network elements ignore any frame that has
              802.1Q header at all, even when the VLAN ID is zero.
              Therefore, by default Open vSwitch does not output
              priority-tagged frames, instead omitting the 802.1Q header
              entirely if the VLAN ID is zero. Set this key to
              <b>if-nonzero </b>to enable priority-tagged frames on a port.

              For <b>if-nonzero </b>Open vSwitch omits the 802.1Q header on
              output if both the VLAN ID and priority would be zero. Set
              to <b>always </b>to retain the 802.1Q header in such frames as
              well.

              All frames output to native-tagged ports have a nonzero
              VLAN ID, so this setting is not meaningful on native-
              tagged ports.

     <i>Bonding Configuration:</i>

       A port that has more than one interface is a ``bonded port.’’
       Bonding allows for load balancing and fail-over.

       The following types of bonding will work with any kind of
       upstream switch. On the upstream switch, do not configure the
       interfaces as a bond:

              <b>balance-slb</b>
                     Balances flows among members based on source MAC
                     address and output VLAN, with periodic rebalancing
                     as traffic patterns change.

              <b>active-backup</b>
                     Assigns all flows to one member, failing over to a
                     backup member when the active member is disabled.
                     This is the only bonding mode in which interfaces
                     may be plugged into different upstream switches.

       The following modes require the upstream switch to support
       802.3ad with successful LACP negotiation. If LACP negotiation
       fails and other-config:lacp-fallback-ab is true, then
       <b>active-backup </b>mode is used:

              <b>balance-tcp</b>
                     Balances flows among members based on L3 and L4
                     protocol information such as IP addresses and
                     TCP/UDP ports.

       These columns apply only to bonded ports. Their values are
       otherwise ignored.

       <b>bond_mode</b>: optional string, one of <b>active-backup</b>, <b>balance-slb</b>, or
       <b>balance-tcp</b>
              The type of bonding used for a bonded port. Defaults to
              <b>active-backup </b>if unset.

       <b>other_config : bond-hash-basis</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer
              An integer hashed along with flows when choosing output
              members in load balanced bonds. When changed, all flows
              will be assigned different hash values possibly causing
              member selection decisions to change. Does not affect
              bonding modes which do not employ load balancing such as
              <b>active-backup</b>.

       <b>other_config : lb-output-action</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Enable/disable usage of optimized <b>lb_output </b>action for
              balancing flows among output members in load balanced
              bonds in <b>balance-tcp</b>. When enabled, it uses optimized path
              for balance-tcp mode by using rss hash and avoids
              recirculation. This knob does not affect other balancing
              modes.

       <b>other_config : bond-primary</b>: optional string
              If a member interface with this name exists in the bond
              and is up, it will be made active. Relevant only when
              <b>other_config:bond_mode </b>is <b>active-backup </b>or if <b>balance-tcp</b>
              falls back to <b>active-backup </b>(e.g., LACP negotiation fails
              and <b>other_config:lacp-fallback-ab </b>is <b>true</b>).

       <b>other_config : all-members-active</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b>
       or <b>false</b>
              Enable/Disable delivery of broadcast/multicast packets on
              secondary interface of a balance-slb bond. Relevant only
              when <b>lacp </b>is <b>off</b>.

              This parameter is identical to <b>all_slaves_active </b>for Linux
              kernel bonds. Disabled by default as it is not a desirable
              configuration for most users.

     <i>Link Failure Detection:</i>

       An important part of link bonding is detecting that links are
       down so that they may be disabled. These settings determine how
       Open vSwitch detects link failure.

       <b>other_config : bond-detect-mode</b>: optional string, either <b>carrier</b>
       or <b>miimon</b>
              The means used to detect link failures. Defaults to
              <b>carrier </b>which uses each interface’s carrier to detect
              failures. When set to <b>miimon</b>, will check for failures by
              polling each interface’s MII.

       <b>other_config : bond-miimon-interval</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer
              The interval, in milliseconds, between successive attempts
              to poll each interface’s MII. Relevant only when
              <b>other_config:bond-detect-mode </b>is <b>miimon</b>.

       <b>bond_updelay</b>: integer
              The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay up
              on an interface before the interface is considered to be
              up. Specify <b>0 </b>to enable the interface immediately.

              This setting is honored only when at least one bonded
              interface is already enabled. When no interfaces are
              enabled, then the first bond interface to come up is
              enabled immediately.

       <b>bond_downdelay</b>: integer
              The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay
              down on an interface before the interface is considered to
              be down. Specify <b>0 </b>to disable the interface immediately.

     <i>LACP Configuration:</i>

       LACP, the Link Aggregation Control Protocol, is an IEEE standard
       that allows switches to automatically detect that they are
       connected by multiple links and aggregate across those links.
       These settings control LACP behavior.

       <b>lacp</b>: optional string, one of <b>active</b>, <b>off</b>, or <b>passive</b>
              Configures LACP on this port. LACP allows directly
              connected switches to negotiate which links may be bonded.
              LACP may be enabled on non-bonded ports for the benefit of
              any switches they may be connected to. <b>active </b>ports are
              allowed to initiate LACP negotiations. <b>passive </b>ports are
              allowed to participate in LACP negotiations initiated by a
              remote switch, but not allowed to initiate such
              negotiations themselves. If LACP is enabled on a port
              whose partner switch does not support LACP, the bond will
              be disabled, unless other-config:lacp-fallback-ab is set
              to true. Defaults to <b>off </b>if unset.

       <b>other_config : lacp-system-id</b>: optional string
              The LACP system ID of this <b>Port</b>. The system ID of a LACP
              bond is used to identify itself to its partners. Must be a
              nonzero MAC address. Defaults to the bridge Ethernet
              address if unset.

       <b>other_config : lacp-system-priority</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, in range 1 to 65,535
              The LACP system priority of this <b>Port</b>. In LACP
              negotiations, link status decisions are made by the system
              with the numerically lower priority.

       <b>other_config : lacp-time</b>: optional string, either <b>fast </b>or <b>slow</b>
              The LACP timing which should be used on this <b>Port</b>. By
              default <b>slow </b>is used. When configured to be <b>fast </b>LACP
              heartbeats are requested at a rate of once per second
              causing connectivity problems to be detected more quickly.
              In <b>slow </b>mode, heartbeats are requested at a rate of once
              every 30 seconds.

       <b>other_config : lacp-fallback-ab</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Determines the behavior of openvswitch bond in LACP mode.
              If the partner switch does not support LACP, setting this
              option to <b>true </b>allows openvswitch to fallback to active-
              backup. If the option is set to <b>false</b>, the bond will be
              disabled. In both the cases, once the partner switch is
              configured to LACP mode, the bond will use LACP.

     <i>Rebalancing Configuration:</i>

       These settings control behavior when a bond is in <b>balance-slb </b>or
       <b>balance-tcp </b>mode.

       <b>other_config : bond-rebalance-interval</b>: optional string,
       containing an integer, in range 0 to 2,147,483,647
              For a load balanced bonded port, the number of
              milliseconds between successive attempts to rebalance the
              bond, that is, to move flows from one interface on the
              bond to another in an attempt to keep usage of each
              interface roughly equal. If zero, load balancing is
              disabled on the bond (link failure still cause flows to
              move). If less than 1000ms, the rebalance interval will be
              1000ms.

       <b>bond_fake_iface</b>: boolean
              For a bonded port, whether to create a fake internal
              interface with the name of the port. Use only for
              compatibility with legacy software that requires this.

     <i>Spanning Tree Protocol:</i>

       The configuration here is only meaningful, and the status is only
       populated, when 802.1D-1998 Spanning Tree Protocol is enabled on
       the port’s <b>Bridge </b>with its <b>stp_enable </b>column.

     <i>STP Configuration:</i>

       <b>other_config : stp-enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              When STP is enabled on a bridge, it is enabled by default
              on all of the bridge’s ports except bond, internal, and
              mirror ports (which do not work with STP). If this
              column’s value is <b>false</b>, STP is disabled on the port.

       <b>other_config : stp-port-num</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 255
              The port number used for the lower 8 bits of the port-id.
              By default, the numbers will be assigned automatically. If
              any port’s number is manually configured on a bridge, then
              they must all be.

       <b>other_config : stp-port-priority</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 255
              The port’s relative priority value for determining the
              root port (the upper 8 bits of the port-id). A port with a
              lower port-id will be chosen as the root port. By default,
              the priority is 0x80.

       <b>other_config : stp-path-cost</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 65,535
              Spanning tree path cost for the port. A lower number
              indicates a faster link. By default, the cost is based on
              the maximum speed of the link.

     <i>STP Status:</i>

       <b>status : stp_port_id</b>: optional string
              The port ID used in spanning tree advertisements for this
              port, as 4 hex digits. Configuring the port ID is
              described in the <b>stp-port-num </b>and <b>stp-port-priority </b>keys
              of the <b>other_config </b>section earlier.

       <b>status : stp_state</b>: optional string, one of <b>blocking</b>, <b>disabled</b>,
       <b>forwarding</b>, <b>learning</b>, or <b>listening</b>
              STP state of the port.

       <b>status : stp_sec_in_state</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time this port has been in the current STP
              state, in seconds.

       <b>status : stp_role</b>: optional string, one of <b>alternate</b>, <b>designated</b>,
       or <b>root</b>
              STP role of the port.

     <i>Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol:</i>

       The configuration here is only meaningful, and the status and
       statistics are only populated, when 802.1D-1998 Spanning Tree
       Protocol is enabled on the port’s <b>Bridge </b>with its <b>stp_enable</b>
       column.

     <i>RSTP Configuration:</i>

       <b>other_config : rstp-enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              When RSTP is enabled on a bridge, it is enabled by default
              on all of the bridge’s ports except bond, internal, and
              mirror ports (which do not work with RSTP). If this
              column’s value is <b>false</b>, RSTP is disabled on the port.

       <b>other_config : rstp-port-priority</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 240
              The port’s relative priority value for determining the
              root port, in multiples of 16. By default, the port
              priority is 0x80 (128). Any value in the lower 4 bits is
              rounded off. The significant upper 4 bits become the upper
              4 bits of the port-id. A port with the lowest port-id is
              elected as the root.

       <b>other_config : rstp-port-num</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              The local RSTP port number, used as the lower 12 bits of
              the port-id. By default the port numbers are assigned
              automatically, and typically may not correspond to the
              OpenFlow port numbers. A port with the lowest port-id is
              elected as the root.

       <b>other_config : rstp-path-cost</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer
              The port path cost. The Port’s contribution, when it is
              the Root Port, to the Root Path Cost for the Bridge. By
              default the cost is automatically calculated from the
              port’s speed.

       <b>other_config : rstp-port-admin-edge</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b>
       or <b>false</b>
              The admin edge port parameter for the Port. Default is
              <b>false</b>.

       <b>other_config : rstp-port-auto-edge</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b>
       or <b>false</b>
              The auto edge port parameter for the Port. Default is
              <b>true</b>.

       <b>other_config : rstp-port-mcheck</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              The mcheck port parameter for the Port. Default is <b>false</b>.
              May be set to force the Port Protocol Migration state
              machine to transmit RST BPDUs for a MigrateTime period, to
              test whether all STP Bridges on the attached LAN have been
              removed and the Port can continue to transmit RSTP BPDUs.
              Setting mcheck has no effect if the Bridge is operating in
              STP Compatibility mode.

              Changing the value from <b>true </b>to <b>false </b>has no effect, but
              needs to be done if this behavior is to be triggered again
              by subsequently changing the value from <b>false </b>to <b>true</b>.

     <i>RSTP Status:</i>

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_port_id</b>: optional string
              The port ID used in spanning tree advertisements for this
              port, as 4 hex digits. Configuring the port ID is
              described in the <b>rstp-port-num </b>and <b>rstp-port-priority </b>keys
              of the <b>other_config </b>section earlier.

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_port_role</b>: optional string, one of <b>Alternate</b>,
       <b>Backup</b>, <b>Designated</b>, <b>Disabled</b>, or <b>Root</b>
              RSTP role of the port.

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_port_state</b>: optional string, one of <b>Disabled</b>,
       <b>Discarding</b>, <b>Forwarding</b>, or <b>Learning</b>
              RSTP state of the port.

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_designated_bridge_id</b>: optional string
              The port’s RSTP designated bridge ID, in the same form as
              <b>rstp_status:rstp_bridge_id </b>in the <b>Bridge </b>table.

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_designated_port_id</b>: optional string
              The port’s RSTP designated port ID, as 4 hex digits.

       <b>rstp_status : rstp_designated_path_cost</b>: optional string,
       containing an integer
              The port’s RSTP designated path cost. Lower is better.

     <i>RSTP Statistics:</i>

       <b>rstp_statistics : rstp_tx_count</b>: optional integer
              Number of RSTP BPDUs transmitted through this port.

       <b>rstp_statistics : rstp_rx_count</b>: optional integer
              Number of valid RSTP BPDUs received by this port.

       <b>rstp_statistics : rstp_error_count</b>: optional integer
              Number of invalid RSTP BPDUs received by this port.

       <b>rstp_statistics : rstp_uptime</b>: optional integer
              The duration covered by the other RSTP statistics, in
              seconds.

     <i>Multicast Snooping:</i>

       <b>other_config : mcast-snooping-flood</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b>
       or <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, multicast packets (except Reports) are
              unconditionally forwarded to the specific port.

       <b>other_config : mcast-snooping-flood-reports</b>: optional string,
       either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, multicast Reports are unconditionally
              forwarded to the specific port.

     <i>Other Features:</i>

       <b>qos</b>: optional <b>QoS</b>
              Quality of Service configuration for this port.

       <b>mac</b>: optional string
              The MAC address to use for this port for the purpose of
              choosing the bridge’s MAC address. This column does not
              necessarily reflect the port’s actual MAC address, nor
              will setting it change the port’s actual MAC address.

       <b>fake_bridge</b>: boolean
              Does this port represent a sub-bridge for its tagged VLAN
              within the Bridge? See ovs-vsctl(8) for more information.

       <b>protected</b>: boolean
              The protected ports feature allows certain ports to be
              designated as protected. Traffic between protected ports
              is blocked. Protected ports can send traffic to
              unprotected ports. Unprotected ports can send traffic to
              any port. Default is false.

       <b>external_ids : fake-bridge-*</b>: optional string
              External IDs for a fake bridge (see the <b>fake_bridge</b>
              column) are defined by prefixing a <b>Bridge external_ids </b>key
              with <b>fake-bridge-</b>, e.g. <b>fake-bridge-bridge-id</b>.

       <b>other_config : transient</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, the port will be removed when <b>ovs-ctl</b>
              <b>start --delete-transient-ports </b>is used.

       <b>bond_active_slave</b>: optional string
              For a bonded port, record the MAC address of the current
              active member.

     <i>Port Statistics:</i>

       Key-value pairs that report port statistics. The update period is
       controlled by <b>other_config:stats-update-interval </b>in the
       <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table.

     <i>Statistics: STP transmit and receive counters:</i>

       <b>statistics : stp_tx_count</b>: optional integer
              Number of STP BPDUs sent on this port by the spanning tree
              library.

       <b>statistics : stp_rx_count</b>: optional integer
              Number of STP BPDUs received on this port and accepted by
              the spanning tree library.

       <b>statistics : stp_error_count</b>: optional integer
              Number of bad STP BPDUs received on this port. Bad BPDUs
              include runt packets and those with an unexpected protocol
              ID.

   <b>Details:</b>
     <i>Core Features:</i>

       <b>name</b>: immutable string (must be unique within table)
              Interface name. Should be alphanumeric. For non-bonded
              port, this should be the same as the port name. It must
              otherwise be unique among the names of ports, interfaces,
              and bridges on a host.

              The maximum length of an interface name depends on the
              underlying datapath:

              •      The names of interfaces implemented as Linux and
                     BSD network devices, including interfaces with type
                     <b>internal</b>, <b>tap</b>, or <b>system </b>plus the different types
                     of tunnel ports, are limited to 15 bytes. Windows
                     limits these names to 255 bytes.

              •      The names of patch ports are not used in the
                     underlying datapath, so operating system
                     restrictions do not apply. Thus, they may have
                     arbitrary length.

              Regardless of other restrictions, OpenFlow only supports
              15-byte names, which means that <b>ovs-ofctl </b>and OpenFlow
              controllers will show names truncated to 15 bytes.

       <b>ifindex</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              A positive interface index as defined for SNMP MIB-II in
              RFCs 1213 and 2863, if the interface has one, otherwise 0.
              The ifindex is useful for seamless integration with
              protocols such as SNMP and sFlow.

       <b>mac_in_use</b>: optional string
              The MAC address in use by this interface.

       <b>mac</b>: optional string
              Ethernet address to set for this interface. If unset then
              the default MAC address is used:

              •      For the local interface, the default is the lowest-
                     numbered MAC address among the other bridge ports,
                     either the value of the <b>mac </b>in its <b>Port </b>record, if
                     set, or its actual MAC (for bonded ports, the MAC
                     of its member whose name is first in alphabetical
                     order). Internal ports and bridge ports that are
                     used as port mirroring destinations (see the <b>Mirror</b>
                     table) are ignored.

              •      For other internal interfaces, the default MAC is
                     randomly generated.

              •      External interfaces typically have a MAC address
                     associated with their hardware.

              Some interfaces may not have a software-controllable MAC
              address. This option only affects internal ports. For
              other type ports, you can change the MAC address outside
              Open vSwitch, using ip command.

       <b>error</b>: optional string
              If the configuration of the port failed, as indicated by
              -1 in <b>ofport</b>, Open vSwitch sets this column to an error
              description in human readable form. Otherwise, Open
              vSwitch clears this column.

     <i>OpenFlow Port Number:</i>

       When a client adds a new interface, Open vSwitch chooses an
       OpenFlow port number for the new port. If the client that adds
       the port fills in <b>ofport_request</b>, then Open vSwitch tries to use
       its value as the OpenFlow port number. Otherwise, or if the
       requested port number is already in use or cannot be used for
       another reason, Open vSwitch automatically assigns a free port
       number. Regardless of how the port number was obtained, Open
       vSwitch then reports in <b>ofport </b>the port number actually assigned.

       Open vSwitch limits the port numbers that it automatically
       assigns to the range 1 through 32,767, inclusive. Controllers
       therefore have free use of ports 32,768 and up.

       <b>ofport</b>: optional integer
              OpenFlow port number for this interface. Open vSwitch sets
              this column’s value, so other clients should treat it as
              read-only.

              The OpenFlow ``local’’ port (<b>OFPP_LOCAL</b>) is 65,534. The
              other valid port numbers are in the range 1 to 65,279,
              inclusive. Value -1 indicates an error adding the
              interface.

       <b>ofport_request</b>: optional integer, in range 1 to 65,279
              Requested OpenFlow port number for this interface.

              A client should ideally set this column’s value in the
              same database transaction that it uses to create the
              interface. Open vSwitch version 2.1 and later will honor a
              later request for a specific port number, althuogh it
              might confuse some controllers: OpenFlow does not have a
              way to announce a port number change, so Open vSwitch
              represents it over OpenFlow as a port deletion followed
              immediately by a port addition.

              If <b>ofport_request </b>is set or changed to some other port’s
              automatically assigned port number, Open vSwitch chooses a
              new port number for the latter port.

     <i>System-Specific Details:</i>

       <b>type</b>: string
              The interface type. The types supported by a particular
              instance of Open vSwitch are listed in the <b>iface_types</b>
              column in the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table. The following types are
              defined:

              <b>system </b>An ordinary network device, e.g. <b>eth0 </b>on Linux.
                     Sometimes referred to as ``external interfaces’’
                     since they are generally connected to hardware
                     external to that on which the Open vSwitch is
                     running. The empty string is a synonym for <b>system</b>.

              <b>internal</b>
                     A simulated network device that sends and receives
                     traffic. An internal interface whose <b>name </b>is the
                     same as its bridge’s <b>name </b>is called the ``local
                     interface.’’ It does not make sense to bond an
                     internal interface, so the terms ``port’’ and
                     ``interface’’ are often used imprecisely for
                     internal interfaces.

              <b>tap    </b>A TUN/TAP device managed by Open vSwitch.

                     Open vSwitch checks the interface state before send
                     packets to the device. When it is <b>down</b>, the packets
                     are dropped and the tx_dropped statistic is updated
                     accordingly. Older versions of Open vSwitch did not
                     check the interface state and then the tx_packets
                     was incremented along with tx_dropped.

              <b>geneve </b>An Ethernet over Geneve
                     (<b><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nvo3-geneve">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nvo3-geneve</a> </b>)
                     IPv4/IPv6 tunnel. A description of how to match and
                     set Geneve options can be found in the <b>ovs-ofctl</b>
                     manual page.

              <b>gre    </b>Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) over IPv4
                     tunnel, configurable to encapsulate layer 2 or
                     layer 3 traffic.

              <b>ip6gre </b>Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) over IPv6
                     tunnel, encapsulate layer 2 traffic.

              <b>vxlan  </b>An Ethernet tunnel over the UDP-based VXLAN
                     protocol described in RFC 7348.

                     Open vSwitch uses IANA-assigned UDP destination
                     port 4789. The source port used for VXLAN traffic
                     varies on a per-flow basis and is in the ephemeral
                     port range.

              <b>lisp   </b>A layer 3 tunnel over the experimental, UDP-based
                     Locator/ID Separation Protocol (RFC 6830).

                     Only IPv4 and IPv6 packets are supported by the
                     protocol, and they are sent and received without an
                     Ethernet header. Traffic to/from LISP ports is
                     expected to be configured explicitly, and the ports
                     are not intended to participate in learning based
                     switching. As such, they are always excluded from
                     packet flooding.

              <b>stt    </b>The Stateless TCP Tunnel (STT) is particularly
                     useful when tunnel endpoints are in end-systems, as
                     it utilizes the capabilities of standard network
                     interface cards to improve performance. STT
                     utilizes a TCP-like header inside the IP header. It
                     is stateless, i.e., there is no TCP connection
                     state of any kind associated with the tunnel. The
                     TCP-like header is used to leverage the
                     capabilities of existing network interface cards,
                     but should not be interpreted as implying any sort
                     of connection state between endpoints. Since the
                     STT protocol does not engage in the usual TCP 3-way
                     handshake, so it will have difficulty traversing
                     stateful firewalls. The protocol is documented at
                     <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-davie-stt">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-davie-stt</a> All
                     traffic uses a default destination port of 7471.

              <b>patch  </b>A pair of virtual devices that act as a patch
                     cable.

              <b>gtpu   </b>GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is a group of IP-
                     based communications protocols used to carry
                     general packet radio service (GPRS) within GSM,
                     UMTS and LTE networks. GTP-U is used for carrying
                     user data within the GPRS core network and between
                     the radio access network and the core network. The
                     user data transported can be packets in any of
                     IPv4, IPv6, or PPP formats.

                     The protocol is documented at
                     <a href="http://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/29281.htm">http://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/29281.htm</a>

                     Open vSwitch uses UDP destination port 2152. The
                     source port used for GTP traffic varies on a per-
                     flow basis and is in the ephemeral port range.

              <b>Bareudp</b>
                     The Bareudp tunnel provides a generic L3
                     encapsulation support for tunnelling different L3
                     protocols like MPLS, IP, NSH etc. inside a UDP
                     tunnel.

              <b>srv6   </b>Segment Routing IPv6 (SRv6) tunnel encapsulates L3
                     traffic as "IPv6 in IPv6" or "IPv4 in IPv6" with
                     Segment Routing Header (SRH) defined in RFC 8754.
                     The segment list in SRH can be set using a SRv6
                     specific option.

     <i>Tunnel Options:</i>

       These options apply to interfaces with <b>type </b>of <b>geneve</b>, <b>bareudp</b>,
       <b>gre</b>, <b>ip6gre</b>, <b>vxlan</b>, <b>lisp</b>, <b>stt </b>and <b>srv6</b>.

       Each tunnel must be uniquely identified by the combination of
       <b>type</b>, <b>options:remote_ip</b>, <b>options:local_ip</b>, and <b>options:in_key</b>. If
       two ports are defined that are the same except one has an
       optional identifier and the other does not, the more specific one
       is matched first. <b>options:in_key </b>is considered more specific than
       <b>options:local_ip </b>if a port defines one and another port defines
       the other. <b>options:in_key </b>is not applicable for bareudp and srv6
       tunnels. Hence it is not considered while identifying bareudp or
       srv6 tunnels.

       <b>options : remote_ip</b>: optional string
              Required. The remote tunnel endpoint, one of:

              •      An IPv4 or IPv6 address (not a DNS name), e.g.
                     <b>192.168.0.123</b>. Only unicast endpoints are
                     supported.

              •      The word <b>flow</b>. The tunnel accepts packets from any
                     remote tunnel endpoint. To process only packets
                     from a specific remote tunnel endpoint, the flow
                     entries may match on the <b>tun_src </b>or
                     <b>tun_ipv6_src</b>field. When sending packets to a
                     <b>remote_ip=flow </b>tunnel, the flow actions must
                     explicitly set the <b>tun_dst </b>or <b>tun_ipv6_dst </b>field to
                     the IP address of the desired remote tunnel
                     endpoint, e.g. with a <b>set_field </b>action.

              The remote tunnel endpoint for any packet received from a
              tunnel is available in the <b>tun_src </b>field for matching in
              the flow table.

       <b>options : local_ip</b>: optional string
              Optional. The tunnel destination IP that received packets
              must match. Default is to match all addresses. If
              specified, may be one of:

              •      An IPv4/IPv6 address (not a DNS name), e.g.
                     <b>192.168.12.3</b>.

              •      The word <b>flow</b>. The tunnel accepts packets sent to
                     any of the local IP addresses of the system running
                     OVS. To process only packets sent to a specific IP
                     address, the flow entries may match on the <b>tun_dst</b>
                     or <b>tun_ipv6_dst </b>field. When sending packets to a
                     <b>local_ip=flow </b>tunnel, the flow actions may
                     explicitly set the <b>tun_src </b>or <b>tun_ipv6_src </b>field to
                     the desired IP address, e.g. with a <b>set_field</b>
                     action. However, while routing the tunneled packet
                     out, the local system may override the specified
                     address with the local IP address configured for
                     the outgoing system interface.

                     This option is valid only for tunnels also
                     configured with the <b>remote_ip=flow </b>option.

              The tunnel destination IP address for any packet received
              from a tunnel is available in the <b>tun_dst </b>or <b>tun_ipv6_dst</b>
              field for matching in the flow table.

       <b>options : in_key</b>: optional string
              Optional, not applicable for <b>bareudp </b>and <b>srv6</b>. The key
              that received packets must contain, one of:

              •      <b>0</b>. The tunnel receives packets with no key or with
                     a key of 0. This is equivalent to specifying no
                     <b>options:in_key </b>at all.

              •      A positive 24-bit (for Geneve, VXLAN, and LISP),

                     tunnel receives only packets with the specified
                     key.

              •      The word <b>flow</b>. The tunnel accepts packets with any
                     key. The key will be placed in the <b>tun_id </b>field for
                     matching in the flow table. The <a href="../man7/ovs-fields.7.html">ovs-fields(7)</a>

       <b>options : out_key</b>: optional string
              Optional, not applicable for <b>bareudp </b>and <b>srv6</b>. The key to
              be set on outgoing packets, one of:

              •      <b>0</b>. Packets sent through the tunnel will have no

                     Packets sent through the tunnel will have the
                     specified key.

              •      The word <b>flow</b>. Packets sent through the tunnel will
                     have the key set using the <b>set_tunnel </b>Nicira
                     OpenFlow vendor extension (0 is used in the absence

       <b>options : dst_port</b>: optional string
              Optional. The tunnel transport layer destination port, for
              UDP and TCP based tunnel protocols (Geneve, VXLAN, LISP,
              and STT).

       <b>options : key</b>: optional string
              Optional. Shorthand to set <b>in_key </b>and <b>out_key </b>at the same
              time.

       <b>options : tos</b>: optional string
              Optional. The value of the ToS bits to be set on the
              encapsulating packet. ToS is interpreted as DSCP and ECN
              bits, ECN part must be zero. It may also be the word
              <b>inherit</b>, in which case the ToS will be copied from the
              inner packet if it is IPv4 or IPv6 (otherwise it will be
              0). The ECN fields are always inherited. Default is 0.

       <b>options : ttl</b>: optional string
              Optional. The TTL to be set on the encapsulating packet.
              It may also be the word <b>inherit</b>, in which case the TTL
              will be copied from the inner packet if it is IPv4 or IPv6
              (otherwise it will be the system default, typically 64).
              Default is the system default TTL.

       <b>options : df_default</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Optional. If enabled, the Don’t Fragment bit will be set
              on tunnel outer headers to allow path MTU discovery.
              Default is enabled; set to <b>false </b>to disable.

       <b>options : egress_pkt_mark</b>: optional string
              Optional. The pkt_mark to be set on the encapsulating
              packet. This option sets packet mark for the tunnel
              endpoint for all tunnel packets including tunnel
              monitoring.

     <i>Tunnel Options: lisp only:</i>

       <b>options : packet_type</b>: optional string, either <b>legacy_l3 </b>or <b>ptap</b>
              A LISP tunnel sends and receives only IPv4 and IPv6
              packets. This option controls what how the tunnel
              represents the packets that it sends and receives:

              •      By default, or if this option is <b>legacy_l3</b>, the
                     tunnel represents packets as Ethernet frames for
                     compatibility with legacy OpenFlow controllers that
                     expect this behavior.

              •      If this option is <b>ptap</b>, the tunnel represents
                     packets using the <b>packet_type </b>mechanism introduced
                     in OpenFlow 1.5.

     <i>Tunnel Options: vxlan only:</i>

       <b>options : exts</b>: optional string
              Optional. Comma separated list of optional VXLAN
              extensions to enable. The following extensions are
              supported:

              •      <b>gbp</b>: VXLAN-GBP allows to transport the group policy
                     context of a packet across the VXLAN tunnel to
                     other network peers. See the description of
                     <b>tun_gbp_id </b>and <b>tun_gbp_flags </b>in <a href="../man7/ovs-fields.7.html">ovs-fields(7)</a> for

              •      <b>gpe</b>: Support for Generic Protocol Encapsulation in
                     accordance with IETF draft
                     <b><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe</a> </b>.
                     Without this option, a VXLAN packet always
                     encapsulates an Ethernet frame. With this option,
                     an VXLAN packet may also encapsulate an IPv4, IPv6,
                     NSH, or MPLS packet.

       <b>options : packet_type</b>: optional string, one of <b>legacy_l2</b>,
       <b>legacy_l3</b>, or <b>ptap</b>
              This option controls what types of packets the tunnel
              sends and receives and how it represents them:

              •      By default, or if this option is <b>legacy_l2</b>, the
                     tunnel sends and receives only Ethernet frames.

              •      If this option is <b>legacy_l3</b>, the tunnel sends and
                     receives only non-Ethernet (L3) packet, but the
                     packets are represented as Ethernet frames for
                     compatibility with legacy OpenFlow controllers that
                     expect this behavior. This requires enabling <b>gpe </b>in
                     <b>options:exts</b>.

              •      If this option is <b>ptap</b>, Open vSwitch represents
                     packets in the tunnel using the <b>packet_type</b>
                     mechanism introduced in OpenFlow 1.5. This
                     mechanism supports any kind of packet, but actually
                     sending and receiving non-Ethernet packets requires
                     additionally enabling <b>gpe </b>in <b>options:exts</b>.

     <i>Tunnel Options: gre only:</i>

       <b>gre </b>interfaces support these options.

       <b>options : packet_type</b>: optional string, one of <b>legacy_l2</b>,
       <b>legacy_l3</b>, or <b>ptap</b>
              This option controls what types of packets the tunnel
              sends and receives and how it represents them:

              •      By default, or if this option is <b>legacy_l2</b>, the
                     tunnel sends and receives only Ethernet frames.

              •      If this option is <b>legacy_l3</b>, the tunnel sends and
                     receives only non-Ethernet (L3) packet, but the
                     packets are represented as Ethernet frames for
                     compatibility with legacy OpenFlow controllers that
                     expect this behavior.

              •      The <b>legacy_l3 </b>option is only available via the user
                     space datapath. The OVS kernel datapath does not
                     support devices of type ARPHRD_IPGRE which is the
                     requirement for <b>legacy_l3 </b>type packets.

              •      If this option is <b>ptap</b>, the tunnel sends and
                     receives any kind of packet. Open vSwitch
                     represents packets in the tunnel using the
                     <b>packet_type </b>mechanism introduced in OpenFlow 1.5.

       <b>options : seq</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Optional. A 4-byte sequence number field for GRE tunnel
              only. Default is disabled, set to <b>true </b>to enable. Sequence
              number is incremented by one on each outgoing packet.

     <i>Tunnel Options: gre, ip6gre, geneve, bareudp and vxlan:</i>

       <b>gre</b>, <b>ip6gre</b>, <b>geneve</b>, <b>bareudp </b>and <b>vxlan </b>interfaces support these
       options.

       <b>options : csum</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Optional. Compute encapsulation header (either GRE or UDP)
              checksums on outgoing packets. Default is disabled, set to
              <b>true </b>to enable. Checksums present on incoming packets will
              be validated regardless of this setting.

              When using the upstream Linux kernel module, computation
              of checksums for <b>geneve </b>and <b>vxlan </b>requires Linux kernel
              version 4.0 or higher. <b>gre </b>and <b>ip6gre </b>support checksums
              for all versions of Open vSwitch that support GRE. The out
              of tree kernel module distributed as part of OVS can
              compute all tunnel checksums on any kernel version that it
              is compatible with.

     <i>Tunnel Options: IPsec:</i>

       Setting any of these options enables IPsec support for a given
       tunnel. <b>gre</b>, <b>geneve</b>, <b>vxlan </b>and <b>stt </b>interfaces support these
       options. See the <b>IPsec </b>section in the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table for a
       description of each mode.

       <b>options : psk</b>: optional string
              In PSK mode only, the preshared secret to negotiate
              tunnel. This value must match on both tunnel ends.

       <b>options : remote_cert</b>: optional string
              In self-signed certificate mode only, name of a PEM file
              containing a certificate of the remote switch. The
              certificate must be x.509 version 3 and with the string in
              common name (CN) also set in the subject alternative name
              (SAN).

       <b>options : remote_name</b>: optional string
              In CA-signed certificate mode only, common name (CN) of
              the remote certificate.

     <i>Tunnel Options: erspan only:</i>

       Only <b>erspan </b>interfaces support these options.

       <b>options : erspan_idx</b>: optional string
              20 bit index/port number associated with the ERSPAN
              traffic’s source port and direction (ingress/egress). This
              field is platform dependent.

       <b>options : erspan_ver</b>: optional string
              ERSPAN version: 1 for version 1 (type II) or 2 for version
              2 (type III).

       <b>options : erspan_dir</b>: optional string
              Specifies the ERSPAN v2 mirrored traffic’s direction. 1
              for egress traffic, and 0 for ingress traffic.

       <b>options : erspan_hwid</b>: optional string
              ERSPAN hardware ID is a 6-bit unique identifier of an
              ERSPAN v2 engine within a system.

     <i>Tunnel Options: Bareudp only:</i>

       <b>options : payload_type</b>: optional string
              Specifies the ethertype of the l3 protocol the bareudp
              device is tunnelling. For the tunnels which supports
              multiple ethertypes of a l3 protocol (IP, MPLS) this field
              specifies the protocol name as a string.

     <i>Tunnel Options: srv6 only:</i>

       <b>options : srv6_segs</b>: optional string
              Specifies the segment list in Segment Routing Header
              (SRH). It consists of a comma-separated list of segments
              represented in IPv6 format, e.g.
              "fc00:100::1,fc00:200::1,fc00:300::1". Note that the first
              segment must be the same as <b>options:remote_ip</b>.

       <b>options : srv6_flowlabel</b>: optional string, one of <b>compute</b>, <b>copy</b>,
       or <b>zero</b>
              Optional. This option controls how flowlabel in outer IPv6
              header is configured. It gives the benefit of IPv6 flow
              label based load balancing, which is supported by some
              popular vendor appliances. Like net.ipv6.seg6_flowlabel
              sysconfig, it is one of the three values below:

              •      By default, or if this option is <b>copy</b>, copy the
                     flowlabel of inner IPv6 header to the flowlabel of
                     outer IPv6 header. If inner header is not IPv6, it
                     is set to 0.

              •      If this option is <b>zero</b>, simply set flowlabel to 0.

              •      If this option is <b>compute</b>, set flowlabel to a hash
                     over the L3/L4 fields of the inner packet.

     <i>Patch Options:</i>

       These options apply only to <i>patch ports</i>, that is, interfaces
       whose <b>type </b>column is <b>patch</b>. Patch ports are mainly a way to
       connect otherwise independent bridges to one another, similar to
       how one might plug an Ethernet cable (a ``patch cable’’) into two
       physical switches to connect those switches. The effect of
       plugging a patch port into two switches is conceptually similar
       to that of plugging the two ends of a Linux <b>veth </b>device into
       those switches, but the implementation of patch ports makes them
       much more efficient.

       Patch ports may connect two different bridges (the usual case) or
       the same bridge. In the latter case, take special care to avoid
       loops, e.g. by programming appropriate flows with OpenFlow. Patch
       ports do not work if its ends are attached to bridges on
       different datapaths, e.g. to connect bridges in <b>system </b>and <b>netdev</b>
       datapaths.

       The following command creates and connects patch ports <b>p0 </b>and <b>p1</b>
       and adds them to bridges <b>br0 </b>and <b>br1</b>, respectively:

       <b>ovs-vsctl add-port br0 p0 -- set Interface p0 type=patch options:peer=p1 \</b>
              <b>-- add-port br1 p1 -- set Interface p1 type=patch options:peer=p0</b>

       <b>options : peer</b>: optional string
              The <b>name </b>of the <b>Interface </b>for the other side of the patch.
              The named <b>Interface</b>’s own <b>peer </b>option must specify this
              <b>Interface</b>’s name. That is, the two patch interfaces must
              have reversed <b>name </b>and <b>peer </b>values.

     <i>PMD (Poll Mode Driver) Options:</i>

       Only PMD netdevs support these options.

       <b>options : n_rxq</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at least
       1
              Specifies the maximum number of rx queues to be created
              for PMD netdev. If not specified or specified to 0, one rx
              queue will be created by default. Not supported by DPDK
              vHost interfaces.

       <b>options : dpdk-devargs</b>: optional string
              Specifies the PCI address associated with the port for
              physical devices, or the virtual driver to be used for the
              port when a virtual PMD is intended to be used. For the
              latter, the argument string typically takes the form of
              <b>eth_</b><i>driver_namex</i>, where <i>driver_name</i> is a valid virtual
              DPDK PMD driver name and <i>x</i> is a unique identifier of your
              choice for the given port. Only supported by the dpdk port
              type.

       <b>other_config : pmd-rxq-affinity</b>: optional string
              Specifies mapping of RX queues of this interface to CPU
              cores.

              Value should be set in the following form:

              <b>other_config:pmd-rxq-affinity=&lt;rxq-affinity-list&gt;</b>

              where

              •      &lt;rxq-affinity-list&gt; ::= NULL | &lt;non-empty-list&gt;

              •      &lt;non-empty-list&gt; ::= &lt;affinity-pair&gt; | &lt;affinity-
                     pair&gt; , &lt;non-empty-list&gt;

              •      &lt;affinity-pair&gt; ::= &lt;queue-id&gt; : &lt;core-id&gt;

       <b>options : xdp-mode</b>: optional string, one of <b>best-effort</b>, <b>generic</b>,
       <b>native-with-zerocopy</b>, or <b>native</b>
              Specifies the operational mode of the XDP program.

              In <b>native-with-zerocopy </b>mode the XDP program is loaded
              into the device driver with zero-copy RX and TX enabled.
              This mode requires device driver support and has the best
              performance because there should be no copying of packets.

              <b>native </b>is the same as <b>native-with-zerocopy</b>, but without
              zero-copy capability. This requires at least one copy
              between kernel and the userspace. This mode also requires
              support from device driver.

              In <b>generic </b>case the XDP program in kernel works after skb
              allocation on early stages of packet processing inside the
              network stack. This mode doesn’t require driver support,
              but has much lower performance.

              <b>best-effort </b>tries to detect and choose the best (fastest)
              from the available modes for current interface.

              Note that this option is specific to netdev-afxdp.
              Defaults to <b>best-effort </b>mode.

       <b>options : use-need-wakeup</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Specifies whether to use need_wakeup feature in afxdp
              netdev. If enabled, OVS explicitly wakes up the kernel RX,
              using poll() syscall and wakes up TX, using sendto()
              syscall. For physical devices, this feature improves the
              performance by avoiding unnecessary sendto syscalls.
              Defaults to true if supported by libbpf.

       <b>options : vhost-server-path</b>: optional string
              The value specifies the path to the socket associated with
              a vHost User client mode device that has been or will be
              created by QEMU. Only supported by dpdkvhostuserclient
              interfaces.

       <b>options : tx-retries-max</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       in range 0 to 32
              The value specifies the maximum amount of vhost tx retries
              that can be made while trying to send a batch of packets
              to an interface. Only supported by dpdkvhostuserclient
              interfaces.

              Default value is 8.

       <b>options : n_rxq_desc</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 4,096
              Specifies the rx queue size (number rx descriptors) for
              dpdk ports. The value must be a power of 2, less than 4096
              and supported by the hardware of the device being
              configured. If not specified or an incorrect value is
              specified, 2048 rx descriptors will be used by default.

       <b>options : n_txq_desc</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 4,096
              Specifies the tx queue size (number tx descriptors) for
              dpdk ports. The value must be a power of 2, less than 4096
              and supported by the hardware of the device being
              configured. If not specified or an incorrect value is
              specified, 2048 tx descriptors will be used by default.

       <b>options : dpdk-vf-mac</b>: optional string
              Ethernet address to set for this VF interface. If unset
              then the default MAC address is used:

              •      For most drivers, the default MAC address assigned
                     by their hardware.

              •      For bifurcated drivers, the MAC currently used by
                     the kernel netdevice.

              This option may only be used with dpdk VF representors.

       <b>options : rx-steering</b>: optional string, either <b>rss+lacp </b>or <b>rss</b>
              Configure hardware Rx queue steering policy.

              This option takes one of the following values:

              <b>rss    </b>Distribution of ingress packets in all Rx queues
                     according to the RSS algorithm. This is the default
                     behaviour.

              <b>rss+lacp</b>
                     Distribution of ingress packets according to the
                     RSS algorithm on all but the last Rx queue. An
                     extra Rx queue is allocated for LACP packets.

              If the user has already configured multiple <b>options:n_rxq</b>
              on the port, an additional one will be allocated for the
              specified protocols. Even if the hardware cannot satisfy
              the requested number of requested Rx queues, the last Rx
              queue will be used. If only one Rx queue is available or
              if the hardware does not support the rte_flow
              matchers/actions required to redirect the selected
              protocols, custom <b>rx-steering </b>will fall back to default
              <b>rss </b>mode.

              This feature is mutually exclusive with <b>other_config:hw-</b>
              <b>offload </b>as it may conflict with the offloaded flows. If
              both are enabled, <b>rx-steering </b>will fall back to default
              <b>rss </b>mode.

              This option is only applicable to interfaces with type
              <b>dpdk</b>.

       <b>other_config : tx-steering</b>: optional string, either <b>hash </b>or
       <b>thread</b>
              Specifies the Tx steering mode for the interface.

              <b>thread </b>enables static (1:1) thread-to-txq mapping when the
              number of Tx queues is greater than number of PMD threads,
              and dynamic (N:1) mapping if equal or lower. In this mode
              a single thread can not use more than 1 transmit queue of
              a given port.

              <b>hash </b>enables hash-based Tx steering, which distributes the
              packets on all the transmit queues based on their 5-tuples
              hashes.

              Defaults to <b>thread</b>.

     <i>EMC (Exact Match Cache) Configuration:</i>

       These settings controls behaviour of EMC lookups/insertions for
       packets received from the interface.

       <b>other_config : emc-enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Specifies if Exact Match Cache (EMC) should be used while
              processing packets received from this interface. If true,
              <b>other_config:emc-insert-inv-prob </b>will have effect on this
              interface.

              Defaults to true.

     <i>MTU:</i>

       The MTU (maximum transmission unit) is the largest amount of data
       that can fit into a single Ethernet frame. The standard Ethernet
       MTU is 1500 bytes. Some physical media and many kinds of virtual
       interfaces can be configured with higher MTUs.

       A client may change an interface MTU by filling in <b>mtu_request</b>.
       Open vSwitch then reports in <b>mtu </b>the currently configured value.

       <b>mtu</b>: optional integer
              The currently configured MTU for the interface.

              This column will be empty for an interface that does not
              have an MTU as, for example, some kinds of tunnels do not.

              Open vSwitch sets this column’s value, so other clients
              should treat it as read-only.

       <b>mtu_request</b>: optional integer, at least 1
              Requested MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) for the
              interface. A client can fill this column to change the MTU
              of an interface.

              RFC 791 requires every internet module to be able to
              forward a datagram of 68 octets without further
              fragmentation. The maximum size of an IP packet is 65535
              bytes.

              If this is not set and if the interface has <b>internal </b>type,
              Open vSwitch will change the MTU to match the minimum of
              the other interfaces in the bridge.

     <i>Interface Status:</i>

       Status information about interfaces attached to bridges, updated
       every 5 seconds. Not all interfaces have all of these properties;
       virtual interfaces don’t have a link speed, for example. Non-
       applicable columns will have empty values.

       <b>admin_state</b>: optional string, either <b>down </b>or <b>up</b>
              The administrative state of the physical network link.

       <b>link_state</b>: optional string, either <b>down </b>or <b>up</b>
              The observed state of the physical network link. This is
              ordinarily the link’s carrier status. If the interface’s
              <b>Port </b>is a bond configured for miimon monitoring, it is
              instead the network link’s miimon status.

       <b>link_resets</b>: optional integer
              The number of times Open vSwitch has observed the
              <b>link_state </b>of this <b>Interface </b>change.

       <b>link_speed</b>: optional integer
              The negotiated speed of the physical network link. Valid
              values are positive integers greater than 0.

       <b>duplex</b>: optional string, either <b>full </b>or <b>half</b>
              The duplex mode of the physical network link.

       <b>lacp_current</b>: optional boolean
              Boolean value indicating LACP status for this interface.
              If true, this interface has current LACP information about
              its LACP partner. This information may be used to monitor
              the health of interfaces in a LACP enabled port. This
              column will be empty if LACP is not enabled.

       <b>status</b>: map of string-string pairs
              Key-value pairs that report port status. Supported status
              values are <b>type</b>-dependent; some interfaces may not have a
              valid <b>status:driver_name</b>, for example.

       <b>status : driver_name</b>: optional string
              The name of the device driver controlling the network
              adapter.

       <b>status : driver_version</b>: optional string
              The version string of the device driver controlling the
              network adapter.

       <b>status : firmware_version</b>: optional string
              The version string of the network adapter’s firmware, if
              available.

       <b>status : source_ip</b>: optional string
              The source IP address used for an IPv4/IPv6 tunnel end-
              point, such as <b>gre</b>.

       <b>status : tunnel_egress_iface</b>: optional string
              Egress interface for tunnels. Currently only relevant for
              tunnels on Linux systems, this column will show the name
              of the interface which is responsible for routing traffic
              destined for the configured <b>options:remote_ip</b>. This could
              be an internal interface such as a bridge port.

       <b>status : tunnel_egress_iface_carrier</b>: optional string, either
       <b>down </b>or <b>up</b>
              Whether carrier is detected on <b>status:tunnel_egress_iface</b>.

              XDP mode currently in use. See <b>options:xdp-mode </b>for
              description of possible values.

     <i>Statistics:</i>

       Key-value pairs that report interface statistics. The current
       implementation updates these counters periodically. The update
       period is controlled by <b>other_config:stats-update-interval </b>in the
       <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table. Future implementations may update them when
       an interface is created, when they are queried (e.g. using an
       OVSDB <b>select </b>operation), and just before an interface is deleted
       due to virtual interface hot-unplug or VM shutdown, and perhaps
       at other times, but not on any regular periodic basis.

       These are the same statistics reported by OpenFlow in its <b>struct</b>
       <b>ofp_port_stats </b>structure. If an interface does not support a
       given statistic, then that pair is omitted.

     <i>Statistics: Successful transmit and receive counters:</i>

       <b>statistics : rx_packets</b>: optional integer
              Number of received packets.

       <b>statistics : rx_bytes</b>: optional integer
              Number of received bytes.

       <b>statistics : tx_packets</b>: optional integer
              Number of transmitted packets.

       <b>statistics : tx_bytes</b>: optional integer
              Number of transmitted bytes.

              Number of packets with RX overrun.

       <b>statistics : rx_crc_err</b>: optional integer
              Number of CRC errors.

       <b>statistics : rx_errors</b>: optional integer
              Total number of receive errors, greater than or equal to
              the sum of the above.

     <i>Statistics: Transmit errors:</i>

       <b>statistics : tx_dropped</b>: optional integer
              Number of packets dropped by TX.

       <b>statistics : collisions</b>: optional integer
              Number of collisions.

       <b>statistics : tx_errors</b>: optional integer
              Total number of transmit errors, greater than or equal to
              the sum of the above.

     <i>Ingress Policing:</i>

       These settings control ingress policing for packets received on
       this interface. On a physical interface, this limits the rate at
       which traffic is allowed into the system from the outside; on a
       virtual interface (one connected to a virtual machine), this
       limits the rate at which the VM is able to transmit.

       Policing is a simple form of quality-of-service that simply drops
       packets received in excess of the configured rate. Due to its
       simplicity, policing is usually less accurate and less effective
       than egress QoS (which is configured using the <b>QoS </b>and <b>Queue</b>
       tables).

       Policing settings can be set with byte rate or packet rate, and
       they can be configured together, in which case they take effect
       together, that means the smaller speed limit of them is in
       effect.

       Currently, byte rate policing is implemented on Linux and OVS
       with DPDK, while packet rate policing is only implemented on
       Linux. Both Linux and OVS DPDK implementations use a simple
       ``token bucket’’ approach.

       Byte rate policing:

              •      The size of the bucket corresponds to
                     <b>ingress_policing_burst</b>. Initially the bucket is
                     full.

              •      Whenever a packet is received, its size (converted
                     to tokens) is compared to the number of tokens
                     currently in the bucket. If the required number of
                     tokens are available, they are removed and the
                     packet is forwarded. Otherwise, the packet is
                     dropped.

              •      Whenever it is not full, the bucket is refilled
                     with tokens at the rate specified by
                     <b>ingress_policing_rate</b>.

       Packet rate policing:

              •      The size of the bucket corresponds to
                     <b>ingress_policing_kpkts_burst</b>. Initially the bucket
                     is full.

              •      Whenever a packet is received, it will consume one
                     token from the current bucket. If the token is
                     available in the bucket, it’s removed and the
                     packet is forwarded. Otherwise, the packet is
                     dropped.

              •      Whenever it is not full, the bucket is refilled
                     with tokens at the rate specified by
                     <b>ingress_policing_kpkts_rate</b>.

       Policing interacts badly with some network protocols, and
       especially with fragmented IP packets. Suppose that there is
       enough network activity to keep the bucket nearly empty all the
       time. Then this token bucket algorithm will forward a single
       packet every so often, with the period depending on packet size
       and on the configured rate. All of the fragments of an IP packets
       are normally transmitted back-to-back, as a group. In such a
       situation, therefore, only one of these fragments will be
       forwarded and the rest will be dropped. IP does not provide any
       way for the intended recipient to ask for only the remaining
       fragments. In such a case there are two likely possibilities for
       what will happen next: either all of the fragments will
       eventually be retransmitted (as TCP will do), in which case the
       same problem will recur, or the sender will not realize that its
       packet has been dropped and data will simply be lost (as some
       UDP-based protocols will do). Either way, it is possible that no
       forward progress will ever occur.

       <b>ingress_policing_rate</b>: integer, at least 0
              Maximum rate for data received on this interface, in kbps.
              Data received faster than this rate is dropped. Set to <b>0</b>
              (the default) to disable policing.

       <b>ingress_policing_kpkts_rate</b>: integer, at least 0
              Maximum rate for data received on this interface, in kpps
              (1 kpps is 1000 pps). Data received faster than this rate
              is dropped. Set to <b>0 </b>(the default) to disable policing.

       <b>ingress_policing_burst</b>: integer, at least 0
              Maximum burst size for data received on this interface, in
              kb. The default burst size if set to <b>0 </b>is 8000 kbit. This
              value has no effect if <b>ingress_policing_rate </b>is <b>0</b>.

              Specifying a larger burst size lets the algorithm be more
              forgiving, which is important for protocols like TCP that
              react severely to dropped packets. The burst size should
              be at least the size of the interface’s MTU. Specifying a
              value that is numerically at least as large as 80% of
              <b>ingress_policing_rate </b>helps TCP come closer to achieving
              the full rate.

       <b>ingress_policing_kpkts_burst</b>: integer, at least 0
              Maximum burst size for data received on this interface, in
              kpkts (1 kpkts is 1000 packets). The default burst size if
              set to <b>0 </b>is 16 kpkts. This value has no effect if
              <b>ingress_policing_kpkts_rate </b>is <b>0</b>.

              Specifying a larger burst size lets the algorithm be more
              forgiving, which is important for protocols like TCP that
              react severely to dropped packets. Specifying a value that
              is numerically at least as large as 80% of

     <i>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):</i>

       BFD, defined in RFC 5880 and RFC 5881, allows point-to-point
       detection of connectivity failures by occasional transmission of
       BFD control messages. Open vSwitch implements BFD to serve as a
       more popular and standards compliant alternative to CFM.

       BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a
       rate negotiated independently in each direction. Each endpoint
       specifies the rate at which it expects to receive control
       messages, and the rate at which it is willing to transmit them.
       By default, Open vSwitch uses a detection multiplier of three,
       meaning that an endpoint signals a connectivity fault if three
       consecutive BFD control messages fail to arrive. In the case of a
       unidirectional connectivity issue, the system not receiving BFD
       control messages signals the problem to its peer in the messages
       it transmits.

       The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply faithfully
       with RFC 5880 requirements. Open vSwitch does not implement the
       optional Authentication or ``Echo Mode’’ features.

       OVS 2.13 and earlier intercepted and processed all BFD packets.
       OVS 2.14 and later only intercept and process BFD packets
       destined to a configured BFD instance, and other BFD packets are
       made available to the OVS flow table for forwarding.

     <i>BFD Configuration:</i>

       A controller sets up key-value pairs in the <b>bfd </b>column to enable
       and configure BFD.

       <b>bfd : enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              True to enable BFD on this <b>Interface</b>. If not specified,
              BFD will not be enabled by default.

       <b>bfd : min_rx</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1
              The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD
              session offers to receive BFD control messages. The remote
              endpoint may choose to send messages at a slower rate.
              Defaults to <b>1000</b>.

       <b>bfd : min_tx</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1
              The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD
              session is willing to transmit BFD control messages.
              Messages will actually be transmitted at a slower rate if
              the remote endpoint is not willing to receive as quickly
              as specified. Defaults to <b>100</b>.

       <b>bfd : decay_min_rx</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              An alternate receive interval, in milliseconds, that must
              be greater than or equal to <b>bfd:min_rx</b>. The implementation
              switches from <b>bfd:min_rx </b>to <b>bfd:decay_min_rx </b>when there is
              no obvious incoming data traffic at the interface, to
              reduce the CPU and bandwidth cost of monitoring an idle
              interface. This feature may be disabled by setting a value
              of 0. This feature is reset whenever <b>bfd:decay_min_rx </b>or
              <b>bfd:min_rx </b>changes.

       <b>bfd : forwarding_if_rx</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              When <b>true</b>, traffic received on the <b>Interface </b>is used to
              indicate the capability of packet I/O. BFD control packets
              are still transmitted and received. At least one BFD
              control packet must be received every 100 * <b>bfd:min_rx</b>
              amount of time. Otherwise, even if traffic are received,
              the <b>bfd:forwarding </b>will be <b>false</b>.

       <b>bfd : cpath_down</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Set to true to notify the remote endpoint that traffic
              should not be forwarded to this system for some reason
              other than a connectivty failure on the interface being
              monitored. The typical underlying reason is ``concatenated
              path down,’’ that is, that connectivity beyond the local
              system is down. Defaults to false.

       <b>bfd : check_tnl_key</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Set to true to make BFD accept only control messages with
              a tunnel key of zero. By default, BFD accepts control
              messages with any tunnel key.

       <b>bfd : bfd_local_src_mac</b>: optional string
              Set to an Ethernet address in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>
              to set the MAC used as source for transmitted BFD packets.
              The default is the mac address of the BFD enabled
              interface.

       <b>bfd : bfd_local_dst_mac</b>: optional string
              Set to an Ethernet address in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>
              to set the MAC used as destination for transmitted BFD
              packets. The default is <b>00:23:20:00:00:01</b>.

       <b>bfd : bfd_remote_dst_mac</b>: optional string
              Set to an Ethernet address in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>
              to set the MAC used for checking the destination of
              received BFD packets. Packets with different destination
              MAC will not be considered as BFD packets. If not
              specified the destination MAC address of received BFD
              packets are not checked.

       <b>bfd : bfd_src_ip</b>: optional string
              Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address used as
              source for transmitted BFD packets. The default is
              <b>169.254.1.1</b>.

       <b>bfd : bfd_dst_ip</b>: optional string
              Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address used as
              destination for transmitted BFD packets. The default is
              <b>169.254.1.0</b>.

       <b>bfd : oam</b>: optional string
              Some tunnel protocols (such as Geneve) include a bit in
              the header to indicate that the encapsulated packet is an
              OAM frame. By setting this to true, BFD packets will be
              marked as OAM if encapsulated in one of these tunnels.

       <b>bfd : mult</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in range 1 to
       255
              The BFD detection multiplier, which defaults to 3. An
              endpoint signals a connectivity fault if the given number
              of consecutive BFD control messages fail to arrive.

     <i>BFD Status:</i>

       The switch sets key-value pairs in the <b>bfd_status </b>column to
       report the status of BFD on this interface. When BFD is not
       enabled, with <b>bfd:enable</b>, the switch clears all key-value pairs
       from <b>bfd_status</b>.

       <b>bfd_status : state</b>: optional string, one of <b>admin_down</b>, <b>down</b>,
       <b>init</b>, or <b>up</b>
              Reports the state of the BFD session. The BFD session is
              fully healthy and negotiated if <b>UP</b>.

       <b>bfd_status : forwarding</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Reports whether the BFD session believes this <b>Interface</b>
              may be used to forward traffic. Typically this means the
              local session is signaling <b>UP</b>, and the remote system isn’t
              signaling a problem such as concatenated path down.

       <b>bfd_status : diagnostic</b>: optional string
              A diagnostic code specifying the local system’s reason for
              the last change in session state. The error messages are
              defined in section 4.1 of [RFC 5880].

       <b>bfd_status : remote_state</b>: optional string, one of <b>admin_down</b>,
       <b>down</b>, <b>init</b>, or <b>up</b>
              Reports the state of the remote endpoint’s BFD session.

       <b>bfd_status : remote_diagnostic</b>: optional string
              A diagnostic code specifying the remote system’s reason
              for the last change in session state. The error messages
              are defined in section 4.1 of [RFC 5880].

       <b>bfd_status : flap_count</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 0
              Counts the number of <b>bfd_status:forwarding </b>flaps since
              start. A flap is considered as a change of the
              <b>bfd_status:forwarding </b>value.

     <i>Connectivity Fault Management:</i>

       802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) allows a group of
       Maintenance Points (MPs) called a Maintenance Association (MA) to
       detect connectivity problems with each other. MPs within a MA
       should have complete and exclusive interconnectivity. This is
       verified by occasionally broadcasting Continuity Check Messages
       (CCMs) at a configurable transmission interval.

       According to the 802.1ag specification, each Maintenance Point
       should be configured out-of-band with a list of Remote
       Maintenance Points it should have connectivity to. Open vSwitch
       differs from the specification in this area. It simply assumes
       the link is faulted if no Remote Maintenance Points are
       reachable, and considers it not faulted otherwise.

       When operating over tunnels which have no <b>in_key</b>, or an <b>in_key </b>of
       <b>flow</b>. CFM will only accept CCMs with a tunnel key of zero.

       <b>cfm_mpid</b>: optional integer
              A Maintenance Point ID (MPID) uniquely identifies each
              endpoint within a Maintenance Association. The MPID is
              used to identify this endpoint to other Maintenance Points
              in the MA. Each end of a link being monitored should have
              a different MPID. Must be configured to enable CFM on this
              <b>Interface</b>.

              According to the 802.1ag specification, MPIDs can only
              range between [1, 8191]. However, extended mode (see
              <b>other_config:cfm_extended</b>) supports eight byte MPIDs.

       <b>cfm_flap_count</b>: optional integer
              Counts the number of cfm fault flapps since boot. A flap
              is considered to be a change of the <b>cfm_fault </b>value.

       <b>cfm_fault</b>: optional boolean
              Indicates a connectivity fault triggered by an inability
              to receive heartbeats from any remote endpoint. When a
              fault is triggered on <b>Interface</b>s participating in bonds,
              they will be disabled.

              Faults can be triggered for several reasons. Most
              importantly they are triggered when no CCMs are received
              for a period of 3.5 times the transmission interval.
              Faults are also triggered when any CCMs indicate that a
              Remote Maintenance Point is not receiving CCMs but able to
              send them. Finally, a fault is triggered if a CCM is
              received which indicates unexpected configuration.
              Notably, this case arises when a CCM is received which
              advertises the local MPID.

       <b>cfm_fault_status : recv</b>: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to a lack of CCMs
              received on the <b>Interface</b>.

       <b>cfm_fault_status : rdi</b>: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception
              of a CCM with the RDI bit flagged. Endpoints set the RDI
              bit in their CCMs when they are not receiving CCMs
              themselves. This typically indicates a unidirectional
              connectivity failure.

       <b>cfm_fault_status : maid</b>: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception
              of a CCM with a MAID other than the one Open vSwitch uses.
              CFM broadcasts are tagged with an identification number in
              addition to the MPID called the MAID. Open vSwitch only
              supports receiving CCM broadcasts tagged with the MAID it
              uses internally.

       <b>cfm_fault_status : loopback</b>: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception
              of a CCM advertising the same MPID configured in the
              <b>cfm_mpid </b>column of this <b>Interface</b>. This may indicate a
              loop in the network.

       <b>cfm_fault_status : overflow</b>: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was triggered because the CFM module
              received CCMs from more remote endpoints than it can keep
              track of.

       <b>cfm_fault_status : override</b>: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was manually triggered by an
              administrator using an <b>ovs-appctl </b>command.

       <b>cfm_fault_status : interval</b>: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception
              of a CCM frame having an invalid interval.

       <b>cfm_remote_opstate</b>: optional string, either <b>down </b>or <b>up</b>
              When in extended mode, indicates the operational state of
              the remote endpoint as either <b>up </b>or <b>down</b>. See
              <b>other_config:cfm_opstate</b>.

       <b>cfm_health</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 100
              Indicates the health of the interface as a percentage of
              CCM frames received over 21 <b>other_config:cfm_interval</b>s.
              The health of an interface is undefined if it is
              communicating with more than one <b>cfm_remote_mpids</b>. It
              reduces if healthy heartbeats are not received at the
              expected rate, and gradually improves as healthy
              heartbeats are received at the desired rate. Every 21
              <b>other_config:cfm_interval</b>s, the health of the interface is
              refreshed.

              As mentioned above, the faults can be triggered for
              several reasons. The link health will deteriorate even if
              heartbeats are received but they are reported to be
              unhealthy. An unhealthy heartbeat in this context is a
              heartbeat for which either some fault is set or is out of
              sequence. The interface health can be 100 only on
              receiving healthy heartbeats at the desired rate.

       <b>cfm_remote_mpids</b>: set of integers
              When CFM is properly configured, Open vSwitch will
              occasionally receive CCM broadcasts. These broadcasts
              contain the MPID of the sending Maintenance Point. The
              list of MPIDs from which this <b>Interface </b>is receiving
              broadcasts from is regularly collected and written to this
              column.

       <b>other_config : cfm_interval</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer
              The interval, in milliseconds, between transmissions of
              CFM heartbeats. Three missed heartbeat receptions indicate
              a connectivity fault.

              In standard operation only intervals of 3, 10, 100, 1,000,
              10,000, 60,000, or 600,000 ms are supported. Other values
              will be rounded down to the nearest value on the list.
              Extended mode (see <b>other_config:cfm_extended</b>) supports any
              interval up to 65,535 ms. In either mode, the default is
              1000 ms.

              We do not recommend using intervals less than 100 ms.

       <b>other_config : cfm_extended</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              When <b>true</b>, the CFM module operates in extended mode. This
              causes it to use a nonstandard destination address to
              avoid conflicting with compliant implementations which may
              be running concurrently on the network. Furthermore,
              extended mode increases the accuracy of the <b>cfm_interval</b>
              configuration parameter by breaking wire compatibility
              with 802.1ag compliant implementations. And extended mode
              allows eight byte MPIDs. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       <b>other_config : cfm_demand</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              When <b>true</b>, and <b>other_config:cfm_extended </b>is true, the CFM
              module operates in demand mode. When in demand mode,
              traffic received on the <b>Interface </b>is used to indicate
              liveness. CCMs are still transmitted and received. At
              least one CCM must be received every 100 *
              <b>other_config:cfm_interval </b>amount of time. Otherwise, even
              if traffic are received, the CFM module will raise the
              connectivity fault.

              Demand mode has a couple of caveats:

              •      To ensure that ovs-vswitchd has enough time to pull
                     statistics from the datapath, the fault detection
                     interval is set to 3.5 *
                     MAX(<b>other_config:cfm_interval</b>, 500) ms.

              •      To avoid ambiguity, demand mode disables itself
                     when there are multiple remote maintenance points.

              •      If the <b>Interface </b>is heavily congested, CCMs
                     containing the <b>other_config:cfm_opstate </b>status may
                     be dropped causing changes in the operational state
                     to be delayed. Similarly, if CCMs containing the
                     RDI bit are not received, unidirectional link
                     failures may not be detected.

       <b>other_config : cfm_opstate</b>: optional string, either <b>down </b>or <b>up</b>
              When <b>down</b>, the CFM module marks all CCMs it generates as
              operationally down without triggering a fault. This allows
              remote maintenance points to choose not to forward traffic
              to the <b>Interface </b>on which this CFM module is running.
              Currently, in Open vSwitch, the opdown bit of CCMs affects
              <b>Interface</b>s participating in bonds, and the bundle OpenFlow
              action. This setting is ignored when CFM is not in
              extended mode. Defaults to <b>up</b>.

       <b>other_config : cfm_ccm_vlan</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              When set, the CFM module will apply a VLAN tag to all CCMs
              it generates with the given value. May be the string
              <b>random </b>in which case each CCM will be tagged with a
              different randomly generated VLAN.

       <b>other_config : cfm_ccm_pcp</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 7
              When set, the CFM module will apply a VLAN tag to all CCMs
              it generates with the given PCP value, the VLAN ID of the
              tag is governed by the value of <b>other_config:cfm_ccm_vlan</b>.
              If <b>other_config:cfm_ccm_vlan </b>is unset, a VLAN ID of zero
              is used.

     <i>Bonding Configuration:</i>

       <b>other_config : lacp-port-id</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 65,535
              The LACP port ID of this <b>Interface</b>. Port IDs are used in
              LACP negotiations to identify individual ports
              participating in a bond.

       <b>other_config : lacp-port-priority</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 65,535
              The LACP port priority of this <b>Interface</b>. In LACP
              negotiations <b>Interface</b>s with numerically lower priorities
              are preferred for aggregation.

       <b>other_config : lacp-aggregation-key</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, in range 1 to 65,535
              The LACP aggregation key of this <b>Interface</b>. <b>Interface</b>s
              with different aggregation keys may not be active within a
              given <b>Port </b>at the same time.

     <i>Virtual Machine Identifiers:</i>

       These key-value pairs specifically apply to an interface that
       represents a virtual Ethernet interface connected to a virtual
       machine. These key-value pairs should not be present for other
       types of interfaces. Keys whose names end in <b>-uuid </b>have values
       that uniquely identify the entity in question.

       <b>external_ids : attached-mac</b>: optional string
              The MAC address programmed into the ``virtual hardware’’
              for this interface, in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>.

       <b>external_ids : iface-id</b>: optional string
              A system-unique identifier for the interface.

       <b>external_ids : iface-status</b>: optional string, either <b>active </b>or
       <b>inactive</b>
              Hypervisors may sometimes have more than one interface
              associated with a given <b>external_ids:iface-id</b>, only one of
              which is actually in use at a given time. For example, in
              some circumstances hypervisor may have both a ``tap’’ and
              a ``vif’’ interface for a single <b>external_ids:iface-id</b>,
              but only uses one of them at a time. A hypervisor that
              behaves this way must mark the currently in use interface
              <b>active </b>and the others <b>inactive</b>. A hypervisor that never
              has more than one interface for a given
              <b>external_ids:iface-id </b>may mark that interface <b>active </b>or
              omit <b>external_ids:iface-status </b>entirely.

              During VM migration, a given <b>external_ids:iface-id </b>might
              transiently be marked <b>active </b>on two different hypervisors.
              That is, <b>active </b>means that this <b>external_ids:iface-id </b>is
              the active instance within a single hypervisor, not in a
              broader scope. There is one exception: some hypervisors
              support ``migration’’ from a given hypervisor to itself
              (most often for test purposes). During such a
              ``migration,’’ two instances of a single
              <b>external_ids:iface-id </b>might both be briefly marked <b>active</b>
              on a single hypervisor.

       <b>external_ids : vm-id</b>: optional string
              The VM to which this interface belongs.

     <i>Auto Attach Configuration:</i>

       Auto Attach configuration for a particular interface.

       <b>lldp : enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              True to enable LLDP on this <b>Interface</b>. If not specified,
              LLDP will be disabled by default.

     <i>Flow control Configuration:</i>

       Ethernet flow control defined in IEEE 802.1Qbb provides link
       level flow control using MAC pause frames. Implemented only for
       interfaces with type <b>dpdk</b>.

       <b>options : rx-flow-ctrl</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Set to <b>true </b>to enable Rx flow control on physical ports.
              By default, Rx flow control is disabled.

       <b>options : tx-flow-ctrl</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Set to <b>true </b>to enable Tx flow control on physical ports.
              By default, Tx flow control is disabled.

       <b>options : flow-ctrl-autoneg</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Set to <b>true </b>to enable flow control auto negotiation on
              physical ports. By default, auto-neg is disabled.

     <i>Link State Change detection mode:</i>

       <b>options : dpdk-lsc-interrupt</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              Set this value to <b>true </b>to configure interrupt mode for
              Link State Change (LSC) detection instead of poll mode for
              the DPDK interface.

              If this value is not set, poll mode is configured.

              This parameter has an effect only on netdev dpdk
              interfaces.

         <b>overflow_policy             </b>optional string, either <b>evict </b>or

       <i>Common Columns:</i>
         <b>external_ids                </b>map of string-string pairs

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>name</b>: optional string
              The table’s name. Set this column to change the name that
              controllers will receive when they request table
              statistics, e.g. <b>ovs-ofctl dump-tables</b>. The name does not
              affect switch behavior.

     <i>Eviction Policy:</i>

       Open vSwitch supports limiting the number of flows that may be
       installed in a flow table, via the <b>flow_limit </b>column. When adding
       a flow would exceed this limit, by default Open vSwitch reports
       an error, but there are two ways to configure Open vSwitch to
       instead delete (``evict’’) a flow to make room for the new one:

              •      Set the <b>overflow_policy </b>column to <b>evict</b>.

              •      Send an OpenFlow 1.4+ ``table mod request’’ to
                     enable eviction for the flow table (e.g. <b>ovs-ofctl</b>
                     <b>-O OpenFlow14 mod-table br0 0 evict </b>to enable
                     eviction on flow table 0 of bridge <b>br0</b>).

       When a flow must be evicted due to overflow, the flow to evict is
       chosen through an approximation of the following algorithm. This
       algorithm is used regardless of how eviction was enabled:

              1.  Divide the flows in the table into groups based on the
                  values of the fields or subfields specified in the
                  <b>groups </b>column, so that all of the flows in a given
                  group have the same values for those fields. If a flow
                  does not specify a given field, that field’s value is
                  treated as 0. If <b>groups </b>is empty, then all of the
                  flows in the flow table are treated as a single group.

              2.  Consider the flows in the largest group, that is, the
                  group that contains the greatest number of flows. If
                  two or more groups all have the same largest number of
                  flows, consider the flows in all of those groups.

              3.  If the flows under consideration have different
                  importance values, eliminate from consideration any
                  flows except those with the lowest importance.
                  (``Importance,’’ a 16-bit integer value attached to
                  each flow, was introduced in OpenFlow 1.4. Flows
                  inserted with older versions of OpenFlow always have
                  an importance of 0.)

              4.  Among the flows under consideration, choose the flow
                  that expires soonest for eviction.

       The eviction process only considers flows that have an idle
       timeout or a hard timeout. That is, eviction never deletes
       permanent flows. (Permanent flows do count against <b>flow_limit</b>.)

       <b>flow_limit</b>: optional integer, at least 0
              If set, limits the number of flows that may be added to
              the table. Open vSwitch may limit the number of flows in a
              table for other reasons, e.g. due to hardware limitations
              or for resource availability or performance reasons.

       <b>overflow_policy</b>: optional string, either <b>evict </b>or <b>refuse</b>
              Controls the switch’s behavior when an OpenFlow flow table
              modification request would add flows in excess of
              <b>flow_limit</b>. The supported values are:

              <b>refuse </b>Refuse to add the flow or flows. This is also the
                     default policy when <b>overflow_policy </b>is unset.

              <b>evict  </b>Delete a flow chosen according to the algorithm
                     described above.

       <b>groups</b>: set of strings
              When <b>overflow_policy </b>is <b>evict</b>, this controls how flows are
              chosen for eviction when the flow table would otherwise
              exceed <b>flow_limit </b>flows. Its value is a set of NXM fields
              or sub-fields, each of which takes one of the forms
              <i>field</i><b>[] </b>or <i>field</i><b>[</b><i>start</i><b>..</b><i>end</i><b>]</b>, e.g. <b>NXM_OF_IN_PORT[]</b>.
              Please see <b>meta-flow.h </b>for a complete list of NXM field
              names.

              Open vSwitch ignores any invalid or unknown field
              specifications.

              When eviction is not enabled, via <b>overflow_policy </b>or an
              OpenFlow 1.4+ ``table mod,’’ this column has no effect.

     <i>Classifier Optimization:</i>

       <b>prefixes</b>: set of up to 3 strings
              This string set specifies which fields should be used for
              address prefix tracking. Prefix tracking allows the
              classifier to skip rules with longer than necessary
              prefixes, resulting in better wildcarding for datapath
              flows.

              Prefix tracking may be beneficial when a flow table
              contains matches on IP address fields with different
              prefix lengths. For example, when a flow table contains IP
              address matches on both full addresses and proper
              prefixes, the full address matches will typically cause
              the datapath flow to un-wildcard the whole address field
              (depending on flow entry priorities). In this case each
              packet with a different address gets handed to the
              userspace for flow processing and generates its own
              datapath flow. With prefix tracking enabled for the
              address field in question packets with addresses matching
              shorter prefixes would generate datapath flows where the
              irrelevant address bits are wildcarded, allowing the same
              datapath flow to handle all the packets within the prefix
              in question. In this case many userspace upcalls can be
              avoided and the overall performance can be better.

              This is a performance optimization only, so packets will
              receive the same treatment with or without prefix
              tracking.

              The supported fields are: <b>tun_id</b>, <b>tun_src</b>, <b>tun_dst</b>,
              <b>tun_ipv6_src</b>, <b>tun_ipv6_dst</b>, <b>nw_src</b>, <b>nw_dst </b>(or aliases
              <b>ip_src </b>and <b>ip_dst</b>), <b>ipv6_src</b>, and <b>ipv6_dst</b>. (Using this
              feature for <b>tun_id </b>would only make sense if the tunnel IDs
              have prefix structure similar to IP addresses.)

              By default, the <b>prefixes=ip_dst,ip_src </b>are used on each
              flow table. This instructs the flow classifier to track
              the IP destination and source addresses used by the rules
              in this specific flow table.

              The keyword <b>none </b>is recognized as an explicit override of
              the default values, causing no prefix fields to be
              tracked.

              To set the prefix fields, the flow table record needs to
              exist:

              <b>ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 flow_tables:0=@N1 -- --id=@N1</b>
              <b>create Flow_Table name=table0</b>
                     Creates a flow table record for the OpenFlow table
                     number 0.

              <b>ovs-vsctl set Flow_Table table0 prefixes=ip_dst,ip_src</b>
                     Enables prefix tracking for IP source and
                     destination address fields.

              There is a maximum number of fields that can be enabled
              for any one flow table. Currently this limit is 3.

              <b>linux-noop</b>
                     Linux ``No operation.’’ By default, Open vSwitch
                     manages quality of service on all of its configured
                     ports. This can be helpful, but sometimes
                     administrators prefer to use other software to
                     manage QoS. This <b>type </b>prevents Open vSwitch from
                     changing the QoS configuration for a port.

              <b>egress-policer</b>
                     A DPDK egress policer algorithm using the DPDK
                     rte_meter library. The rte_meter library provides
                     an implementation which allows the metering and
                     policing of traffic. The implementation in OVS
                     essentially creates a single token bucket used to
                     police traffic. It should be noted that when the
                     rte_meter is configured as part of QoS there will
                     be a performance overhead as the rte_meter itself
                     will consume CPU cycles in order to police traffic.
                     These CPU cycles ordinarily are used for packet
                     proccessing. As such the drop in performance will
                     be noticed in terms of overall aggregate traffic
                     throughput.

              <b>trtcm-policer</b>
                     A DPDK egress policer algorithm using RFC 4115’s
                     Two-Rate, Three-Color marker. It’s a two-level
                     hierarchical policer which first does a color-blind
                     marking of the traffic at the queue level, followed
                     by a color-aware marking at the port level. At the
                     end traffic marked as Green or Yellow is forwarded,
                     Red is dropped. For details on how traffic is
                     marked, see RFC 4115. If the ``default queue’’, 0,
                     is not configured it’s automatically created with
                     the same <b>other_config </b>values as the physical port.

       <b>queues</b>: map of integer-<b>Queue </b>pairs, key in range 0 to
       4,294,967,295
              A map from queue numbers to <b>Queue </b>records. The supported
              range of queue numbers depend on <b>type</b>. The queue numbers
              are the same as the <b>queue_id </b>used in OpenFlow in <b>struct</b>
              <b>ofp_action_enqueue </b>and other structures.

              Queue 0 is the ``default queue.’’ It is used by OpenFlow
              output actions when no specific queue has been set. When
              no configuration for queue 0 is present, it is
              automatically configured as if a <b>Queue </b>record with empty
              <b>dscp </b>and <b>other_config </b>columns had been specified. (Before
              version 1.6, Open vSwitch would leave queue 0 unconfigured
              in this case. With some queuing disciplines, this dropped
              all packets destined for the default queue.)

     <i>Configuration for linux-htb and linux-hfsc:</i>

       The <b>linux-htb </b>and <b>linux-hfsc </b>classes support the following key-
       value pair:

       <b>other_config : max-rate</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              Maximum rate shared by all queued traffic, in bit/s.
              Optional. If not specified, for physical interfaces, the
              default is the link rate. For other interfaces or if the
              link rate cannot be determined, the default is currently
              10 Gbps.

     <i>Configuration for egress-policer QoS:</i>

       <b>QoS type egress-policer </b>provides egress policing for userspace
       port types with DPDK. It has the following key-value pairs
       defined.

       <b>other_config : cir</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Committed Information Rate (CIR) is measured in bytes
              of IP packets per second, i.e. it includes the IP header,
              but not link specific (e.g. Ethernet) headers. This
              represents the bytes per second rate at which the token
              bucket will be updated. The cir value is calculated by
              (pps x packet data size). For example assuming a user
              wishes to limit a stream consisting of 64 byte packets to
              1 million packets per second the CIR would be set to to to
              46000000. This value can be broken into ’1,000,000 x 46’.
              Where 1,000,000 is the policing rate for the number of
              packets per second and 46 represents the size of the
              packet data for a 64 bytes IP packet without 14 bytes
              Ethernet and 4 bytes FCS header.

       <b>other_config : cbs</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Committed Burst Size (CBS) is measured in bytes and
              represents a token bucket. At a minimum this value should
              be be set to the expected largest size packet in the
              traffic stream. In practice larger values may be used to
              increase the size of the token bucket. If a packet can be
              transmitted then the cbs will be decremented by the number
              of bytes/tokens of the packet. If there are not enough
              tokens in the cbs bucket the packet will be dropped.

       <b>other_config : eir</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Excess Information Rate (EIR) is measured in bytes of
              IP packets per second, i.e. it includes the IP header, but
              not link specific (e.g. Ethernet) headers. This represents
              the bytes per second rate at which the token bucket will
              be updated. The eir value is calculated by (pps x packet
              data size). For example assuming a user wishes to limit a
              stream consisting of 64 byte packets to 1 million packets
              per second the EIR would be set to to to 46000000. This
              value can be broken into ’1,000,000 x 46’. Where 1,000,000
              is the policing rate for the number of packets per second
              and 46 represents the size of the packet data for a 64
              bytes IP packet without 14 bytes Ethernet and 4 bytes FCS
              header.

       <b>other_config : ebs</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Excess Burst Size (EBS) is measured in bytes and
              represents a token bucket. At a minimum this value should
              be be set to the expected largest size packet in the
              traffic stream. In practice larger values may be used to
              increase the size of the token bucket. If a packet can be
              transmitted then the ebs will be decremented by the number
              of bytes/tokens of the packet. If there are not enough
              tokens in the cbs bucket the packet might be dropped.

     <i>Configuration for linux-sfq:</i>

       The <b>linux-sfq </b>QoS supports the following key-value pairs:

       <b>other_config : perturb</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              Number of seconds between consecutive perturbations in
              hashing algorithm. Different flows can end up in the same
              hash bucket causing unfairness. Perturbation’s goal is to
              remove possible unfairness. The default and recommended
              value is 10. Too low a value is discouraged because each
              perturbation can cause packet reordering.

       <b>other_config : quantum</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              Number of bytes <b>linux-sfq </b>QoS can dequeue in one turn in
              round-robin from one flow. The default and recommended
              value is equal to interface’s MTU.

     <i>Configuration for linux-netem:</i>

       The <b>linux-netem </b>QoS supports the following key-value pairs:

       <b>other_config : latency</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              Adds the chosen delay to the packets outgoing to chosen
              network interface. The latency value expressed in us.

       <b>other_config : limit</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              Maximum number of packets the qdisc may hold queued at a
              time. The default value is 1000.

       <b>other_config : loss</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              Adds an independent loss probability to the packets
              outgoing from the chosen network interface.

       <b>other_config : jitter</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              Adds the provided jitter to the latency outgoing to the
              chosen network interface. The jitter value expressed in
              us.

Mirror TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       A port mirror within a <b>Bridge</b>.

       A port mirror configures a bridge to send selected frames to
       special ``mirrored’’ ports, in addition to their normal
       destinations. Mirroring traffic may also be referred to as SPAN
       or RSPAN, depending on how the mirrored traffic is sent.

       When a packet enters an Open vSwitch bridge, it becomes eligible
       for mirroring based on its ingress port and VLAN. As the packet
       travels through the flow tables, each time it is output to a
       port, it becomes eligible for mirroring based on the egress port
       and VLAN. In Open vSwitch 2.5 and later, mirroring occurs just
       after a packet first becomes eligible, using the packet as it
       exists at that point; in Open vSwitch 2.4 and earlier, mirroring
       occurs only after a packet has traversed all the flow tables,
       using the original packet as it entered the bridge. This makes a
       difference only when the flow table modifies the packet: in Open
       vSwitch 2.4, the modifications are never visible to mirrors,
       whereas in Open vSwitch 2.5 and later modifications made before
       the first output that makes it eligible for mirroring to a
       particular destination are visible.

       A packet that enters an Open vSwitch bridge is mirrored to a
       particular destination only once, even if it is eligible for
       multiple reasons. For example, a packet would be mirrored to a
       particular <b>output_port </b>only once, even if it is selected for
       mirroring to that port by <b>select_dst_port </b>and <b>select_src_port </b>in
       the same or different <b>Mirror </b>records.

     <i>Selecting Packets for Mirroring:</i>

       To be selected for mirroring, a given packet must enter or leave
       the bridge through a selected port and it must also be in one of
       the selected VLANs.

       <b>select_all</b>: boolean
              If true, every packet arriving or departing on any port is
              selected for mirroring.

       <b>select_dst_port</b>: set of weak reference to <b>Port</b>s
              Ports on which departing packets are selected for
              mirroring.

       <b>select_src_port</b>: set of weak reference to <b>Port</b>s
              Ports on which arriving packets are selected for
              mirroring.

       <b>select_vlan</b>: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              VLANs on which packets are selected for mirroring. An
              empty set selects packets on all VLANs.

     <i>Mirroring Destination Configuration:</i>

       These columns are mutually exclusive. Exactly one of them must be
       nonempty.

       <b>output_port</b>: optional weak reference to <b>Port</b>
              Output port for selected packets, if nonempty.

              Specifying a port for mirror output reserves that port
              exclusively for mirroring. No frames other than those
              selected for mirroring via this column will be forwarded
              to the port, and any frames received on the port will be
              discarded.

              The output port may be any kind of port supported by Open
              vSwitch. It may be, for example, a physical port
              (sometimes called SPAN) or a GRE tunnel.

       <b>output_vlan</b>: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              Output VLAN for selected packets, if nonempty.

              The frames will be sent out all ports that trunk
              <b>output_vlan</b>, as well as any ports with implicit VLAN
              <b>output_vlan</b>. When a mirrored frame is sent out a trunk
              port, the frame’s VLAN tag will be set to <b>output_vlan</b>,
              replacing any existing tag; when it is sent out an
              implicit VLAN port, the frame will not be tagged. This
              type of mirroring is sometimes called RSPAN.

              See the documentation for <b>other_config:forward-bpdu </b>in the
              <b>Interface </b>table for a list of destination MAC addresses
              which will not be mirrored to a VLAN to avoid confusing
              switches that interpret the protocols that they represent.

              <b>Please note: </b>Mirroring to a VLAN can disrupt a network
              that contains unmanaged switches. Consider an unmanaged
              physical switch with two ports: port 1, connected to an
              end host, and port 2, connected to an Open vSwitch
              configured to mirror received packets into VLAN 123 on
              port 2. Suppose that the end host sends a packet on port 1
              that the physical switch forwards to port 2. The Open
              vSwitch forwards this packet to its destination and then
              reflects it back on port 2 in VLAN 123. This reflected
              packet causes the unmanaged physical switch to replace the
              MAC learning table entry, which correctly pointed to port
              1, with one that incorrectly points to port 2. Afterward,
              the physical switch will direct packets destined for the
              end host to the Open vSwitch on port 2, instead of to the
              end host on port 1, disrupting connectivity. If mirroring
              to a VLAN is desired in this scenario, then the physical
              switch must be replaced by one that learns Ethernet
              addresses on a per-VLAN basis. In addition, learning
              should be disabled on the VLAN containing mirrored
              traffic. If this is not done then intermediate switches
              will learn the MAC address of each end host from the
              mirrored traffic. If packets being sent to that end host
              are also mirrored, then they will be dropped since the
              switch will attempt to send them out the input port.
              Disabling learning for the VLAN will cause the switch to
              correctly send the packet out all ports configured for
              that VLAN. If Open vSwitch is being used as an
              intermediate switch, learning can be disabled by adding
              the mirrored VLAN to <b>flood_vlans </b>in the appropriate <b>Bridge</b>
              table or tables.

              Mirroring to a GRE tunnel has fewer caveats than mirroring
              to a VLAN and should generally be preferred.

       <b>snaplen</b>: optional integer, in range 14 to 65,535
              Maximum per-packet number of bytes to mirror.

              A mirrored packet with size larger than <b>snaplen </b>will be
              truncated in datapath to <b>snaplen </b>bytes before sending to
              the mirror output port. If omitted, packets are not
              truncated.

   <b>Details:</b>
     <i>Core Features:</i>

       <b>type</b>: optional string, either <b>primary </b>or <b>service</b>
              Open vSwitch supports two kinds of OpenFlow controllers. A
              bridge may have any number of each kind:

              Primary controllers
                     This is the kind of controller envisioned by the
                     OpenFlow specifications. Usually, a primary
                     controller implements a network policy by taking
                     charge of the switch’s flow table.

                     The <b>fail_mode </b>column in the <b>Bridge </b>table applies to
                     primary controllers.

                     When multiple primary controllers are configured,
                     Open vSwitch connects to all of them
                     simultaneously. OpenFlow provides few facilities to
                     allow multiple controllers to coordinate in
                     interacting with a single switch, so more than one
                     primary controller should be specified only if the
                     controllers are themselves designed to coordinate
                     with each other.

              Service controllers
                     These kinds of OpenFlow controller connections are
                     intended for occasional support and maintenance
                     use, e.g. with <b>ovs-ofctl</b>. Usually a service
                     controller connects only briefly to inspect or
                     modify some of a switch’s state.

                     The <b>fail_mode </b>column in the <b>Bridge </b>table does not
                     apply to service controllers.

              By default, Open vSwitch treats controllers with active
              connection methods as primary controllers and those with
              passive connection methods as service controllers. Set
              this column to the desired type to override this default.

       <b>target</b>: string
              Connection method for controller.

              The following active connection methods are currently
              supported:

              <b>ssl:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified SSL <i>port</i> on the host at the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address. The <b>ssl </b>column
                     in the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table must point to a valid SSL
                     configuration when this form is used.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not
                     always built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>tcp:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified TCP <i>port</i> on the host at the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).
                     If <i>host</i> is an IPv6 address, wrap it in square
                     brackets, e.g. <b>tcp:[::1]:6653</b>.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

              The following passive connection methods are currently
              supported:

              <b>pssl:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for SSL connections on the specified TCP
                     <i>port</i>. If <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if
                     built with unbound library) or an IP address, is
                     specified, then connections are restricted to the
                     resolved or specified local IP address (either IPv4
                     or IPv6). If <i>host</i> is an IPv6 address, wrap it in
                     square brackets, e.g. <b>pssl:6653:[::1]</b>.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6653. If
                     <i>host</i> is not specified then it listens only on IPv4
                     (but not IPv6) addresses. The <b>ssl </b>column in the
                     <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table must point to a valid SSL
                     configuration when this form is used.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it currently to 6653.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not
                     always built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>ptcp:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for connections on the specified TCP <i>port</i>.
                     If <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built
                     with unbound library) or an IP address, is
                     specified, then connections are restricted to the
                     resolved or specified local IP address (either IPv4
                     or IPv6). If <i>host</i> is an IPv6 address, wrap it in
                     square brackets, e.g. <b>ptcp:6653:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is
                     not specified then it listens only on IPv4
                     addresses.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

              When multiple controllers are configured for a single
              bridge, the <b>target </b>values must be unique. Duplicate <b>target</b>
              values yield unspecified results.

       <b>connection_mode</b>: optional string, either <b>in-band </b>or <b>out-of-band</b>
              If it is specified, this setting must be one of the
              following strings that describes how Open vSwitch contacts
              this OpenFlow controller over the network:

              <b>in-band</b>
                     In this mode, this controller’s OpenFlow traffic
                     travels over the bridge associated with the
                     controller. With this setting, Open vSwitch allows
                     traffic to and from the controller regardless of
                     the contents of the OpenFlow flow table.
                     (Otherwise, Open vSwitch would never be able to
                     connect to the controller, because it did not have
                     a flow to enable it.) This is the most common
                     connection mode because it is not necessary to
                     maintain two independent networks.

              <b>out-of-band</b>
                     In this mode, OpenFlow traffic uses a control
                     network separate from the bridge associated with
                     this controller, that is, the bridge does not use
                     any of its own network devices to communicate with
                     the controller. The control network must be
                     configured separately, before or after <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
                     is started.

              If not specified, the default is implementation-specific.

     <i>Controller Failure Detection and Handling:</i>

       <b>max_backoff</b>: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection
              attempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       <b>inactivity_probe</b>: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection
              to controller before sending an inactivity probe message.
              If Open vSwitch does not communicate with the controller
              for the specified number of seconds, it will send a probe.
              If a response is not received for the same additional
              amount of time, Open vSwitch assumes the connection has
              been broken and attempts to reconnect. Default is
              implementation-specific. A value of 0 disables inactivity
              probes.

     <i>Asynchronous Messages:</i>

       OpenFlow switches send certain messages to controllers
       spontanenously, that is, not in response to any request from the
       controller. These messages are called ``asynchronous messages.’’
       These columns allow asynchronous messages to be limited or
       disabled to ensure the best use of network resources.

       <b>enable_async_messages</b>: optional boolean
              The OpenFlow protocol enables asynchronous messages at
              time of connection establishment, which means that a
              controller can receive asynchronous messages, potentially
              many of them, even if it turns them off immediately after
              connecting. Set this column to <b>false </b>to change Open
              vSwitch behavior to disable, by default, all asynchronous
              messages. The controller can use the <b>NXT_SET_ASYNC_CONFIG</b>
              Nicira extension to OpenFlow to turn on any messages that
              it does want to receive, if any.

     <i>Controller Rate Limiting:</i>

       A switch can forward packets to a controller over the OpenFlow
       protocol. Forwarding packets this way at too high a rate can
       overwhelm a controller, frustrate use of the OpenFlow connection
       for other purposes, increase the latency of flow setup, and use
       an unreasonable amount of bandwidth. Therefore, Open vSwitch
       supports limiting the rate of packet forwarding to a controller.

       There are two main reasons in OpenFlow for a packet to be sent to
       a controller: either the packet ``misses’’ in the flow table,
       that is, there is no matching flow, or a flow table action says
       to send the packet to the controller. Open vSwitch limits the
       rate of each kind of packet separately at the configured rate.
       Therefore, the actual rate that packets are sent to the
       controller can be up to twice the configured rate, when packets
       are sent for both reasons.

       This feature is specific to forwarding packets over an OpenFlow
       connection. It is not general-purpose QoS. See the <b>QoS </b>table for
       quality of service configuration, and <b>ingress_policing_rate </b>in
       the <b>Interface </b>table for ingress policing configuration.

       <b>controller_queue_size</b>: optional integer, in range 1 to 512
              This sets the maximum size of the queue of packets that
              need to be sent to this OpenFlow controller. The value
              must be less than 512. If not specified the queue size is
              limited to the value set for the management controller in
              <b>other_config:controller-queue-size </b>if present or 100
              packets by default. Note: increasing the queue size might
              have a negative impact on latency.

       <b>controller_rate_limit</b>: optional integer, at least 100
              The maximum rate at which the switch will forward packets
              to the OpenFlow controller, in packets per second. If no
              value is specified, rate limiting is disabled.

       <b>controller_burst_limit</b>: optional integer, at least 25
              When a high rate triggers rate-limiting, Open vSwitch
              queues packets to the controller for each port and
              transmits them to the controller at the configured rate.
              This value limits the number of queued packets. Ports on a
              bridge share the packet queue fairly.

              This value has no effect unless <b>controller_rate_limit </b>is
              configured. The current default when this value is not
              specified is one-quarter of <b>controller_rate_limit</b>, meaning
              that queuing can delay forwarding a packet to the
              controller by up to 250 ms.

     <i>Controller Rate Limiting Statistics:</i>

       These values report the effects of rate limiting. Their values
       are relative to establishment of the most recent OpenFlow
       connection, or since rate limiting was enabled, whichever
       happened more recently. Each consists of two values, one with
       <b>TYPE </b>replaced by <b>miss </b>for rate limiting flow table misses, and
       the other with <b>TYPE </b>replaced by <b>action </b>for rate limiting packets
       sent by OpenFlow actions.

       These statistics are reported only when controller rate limiting
       is enabled.

       <b>status : packet-in-TYPE-bypassed</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Number of packets sent directly to the controller, without
              queuing, because the rate did not exceed the configured
              maximum.

       <b>status : packet-in-TYPE-queued</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Number of packets added to the queue to send later.

       <b>status : packet-in-TYPE-dropped</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Number of packets added to the queue that were later
              dropped due to overflow. This value is less than or equal
              to <b>status:packet-in-TYPE-queued</b>.

       <b>status : packet-in-TYPE-backlog</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Number of packets currently queued. The other statistics
              increase monotonically, but this one fluctuates between 0
              and the <b>controller_burst_limit </b>as conditions change.

     <i>Additional In-Band Configuration:</i>

       These values are considered only in in-band control mode (see
       <b>connection_mode</b>).

       When multiple controllers are configured on a single bridge,
       there should be only one set of unique values in these columns.
       If different values are set for these columns in different
       controllers, the effect is unspecified.

       <b>local_ip</b>: optional string
              The IP address to configure on the local port, e.g.
              <b>192.168.0.123</b>. If this value is unset, then <b>local_netmask</b>
              and <b>local_gateway </b>are ignored.

       <b>local_netmask</b>: optional string
              The IP netmask to configure on the local port, e.g.
              <b>255.255.255.0</b>. If <b>local_ip </b>is set but this value is unset,
              then the default is chosen based on whether the IP address
              is class A, B, or C.

       <b>local_gateway</b>: optional string
              The IP address of the gateway to configure on the local
              port, as a string, e.g. <b>192.168.0.1</b>. Leave this column
              unset if this network has no gateway.

     <i>Controller Status:</i>

       <b>is_connected</b>: boolean
              <b>true </b>if currently connected to this controller, <b>false</b>
              otherwise.

       <b>role</b>: optional string, one of <b>master</b>, <b>other</b>, or <b>slave</b>
              The level of authority this controller has on the
              associated bridge. Possible values are:

              <b>other  </b>Allows the controller access to all OpenFlow
                     features.

              <b>master </b>Equivalent to <b>other</b>, except that there may be at
                     most one such controller at a time. If a given
                     controller promotes itself to this role,
                     <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>demotes any existing controller with
                     the role to <b>slave</b>.

              <b>slave  </b>Allows the controller read-only access to OpenFlow
                     features. Attempts to modify the flow table will be
                     rejected with an error. Such controllers do not
                     receive OFPT_PACKET_IN or OFPT_FLOW_REMOVED
                     messages, but they do receive OFPT_PORT_STATUS
                     messages.

       <b>status : last_error</b>: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the
              connection to the controller; i.e. <b>strerror(errno)</b>. This
              key will exist only if an error has occurred.

       <b>status : state</b>: optional string, one of <b>ACTIVE</b>, <b>BACKOFF</b>,
       <b>CONNECTING</b>, <b>IDLE</b>, or <b>VOID</b>
              The state of the connection to the controller:

              <b>VOID   </b>Connection is disabled.

              <b>BACKOFF</b>
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              <b>CONNECTING</b>
                     Attempting to connect.

              <b>ACTIVE </b>Connected, remote host responsive.

              <b>IDLE   </b>Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-
                     alive.

              These values may change in the future. They are provided
              only for human consumption.

       <b>status : sec_since_connect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this controller last successfully
              connected to the switch (in seconds). Value is empty if
              controller has never successfully connected.

       <b>status : sec_since_disconnect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 1
              The amount of time since this controller last disconnected
              from the switch (in seconds). Value is empty if controller
              has never disconnected.

     <i>Connection Parameters:</i>

       Additional configuration for a connection between the controller
       and the Open vSwitch.

       <b>other_config : dscp</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) is specified
              using 6 bits in the Type of Service (TOS) field in the IP
              header. DSCP provides a mechanism to classify the network
              traffic and provide Quality of Service (QoS) on IP
              networks. The DSCP value specified here is used when
              establishing the connection between the controller and the
              Open vSwitch. If no value is specified, a default value of
              48 is chosen. Valid DSCP values must be in the range 0 to
              63.

     <i>Common Columns:</i>

       The overall purpose of these columns is described under <b>Common</b>
       <b>Columns </b>at the beginning of this document.

       <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs

</pre> <h2>
Manager TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Configuration for a database connection to an Open vSwitch
       database (OVSDB) client.

       This table primarily configures the Open vSwitch database
       (<b>ovsdb-server</b>), not the Open vSwitch switch (<b>ovs-vswitchd</b>). The
       switch does read the table to determine what connections should
       be treated as in-band.

       The Open vSwitch database server can initiate and maintain active
       connections to remote clients. It can also listen for database
       connections.

   <b>Details:</b>
     <i>Core Features:</i>

       <b>target</b>: string (must be unique within table)
              Connection method for managers.

              The following connection methods are currently supported:

              <b>ssl:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified SSL <i>port</i> on the host at the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address. The <b>ssl </b>column
                     in the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table must point to a valid SSL
                     configuration when this form is used.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not
                     always built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>tcp:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified TCP <i>port</i> on the host at the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).
                     If <i>host</i> is an IPv6 address, wrap it in square
                     brackets, e.g. <b>tcp:[::1]:6640</b>.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              <b>pssl:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for SSL connections on the specified TCP
                     <i>port</i>. Specify 0 for <i>port</i> to have the kernel
                     automatically choose an available port. If <i>host</i>,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address, is specified,
                     then connections are restricted to the resolved or
                     specified local IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6
                     address). If <i>host</i> is an IPv6 address, wrap in
                     square brackets, e.g. <b>pssl:6640:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is
                     not specified then it listens only on IPv4 (but not
                     IPv6) addresses. The <b>ssl </b>column in the <b>Open_vSwitch</b>
                     table must point to a valid SSL configuration when
                     this form is used.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not
                     always built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>ptcp:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for connections on the specified TCP <i>port</i>.
                     Specify 0 for <i>port</i> to have the kernel automatically
                     choose an available port. If <i>host</i>, which can either
                     be a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or an
                     IP address, is specified, then connections are
                     restricted to the resolved or specified local IP
                     address (either IPv4 or IPv6 address). If <i>host</i> is
                     an IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g.
                     <b>ptcp:6640:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is not specified then it
                     listens only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              When multiple managers are configured, the <b>target </b>values
              must be unique. Duplicate <b>target </b>values yield unspecified
              results.

       <b>connection_mode</b>: optional string, either <b>in-band </b>or <b>out-of-band</b>
              If it is specified, this setting must be one of the
              following strings that describes how Open vSwitch contacts
              this OVSDB client over the network:

              <b>in-band</b>
                     In this mode, this connection’s traffic travels
                     over a bridge managed by Open vSwitch. With this
                     setting, Open vSwitch allows traffic to and from
                     the client regardless of the contents of the
                     OpenFlow flow table. (Otherwise, Open vSwitch would
                     never be able to connect to the client, because it
                     did not have a flow to enable it.) This is the most
                     common connection mode because it is not necessary
                     to maintain two independent networks.

              <b>out-of-band</b>
                     In this mode, the client’s traffic uses a control
                     network separate from that managed by Open vSwitch,
                     that is, Open vSwitch does not use any of its own
                     network devices to communicate with the client. The
                     control network must be configured separately,
                     before or after <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is started.

              If not specified, the default is implementation-specific.

     <i>Client Failure Detection and Handling:</i>

       <b>max_backoff</b>: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection
              attempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       <b>inactivity_probe</b>: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection
              to the client before sending an inactivity probe message.
              If Open vSwitch does not communicate with the client for
              the specified number of seconds, it will send a probe. If
              a response is not received for the same additional amount
              of time, Open vSwitch assumes the connection has been
              broken and attempts to reconnect. Default is
              implementation-specific. A value of 0 disables inactivity
              probes.

     <i>Status:</i>

       Key-value pair of <b>is_connected </b>is always updated. Other key-value
       pairs in the status columns may be updated depends on the <b>target</b>
       type.

       When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
       inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>punix:</b>), both <b>n_connections</b>
       and <b>is_connected </b>may also be updated while the remaining key-
       value pairs are omitted.

       On the other hand, when <b>target </b>specifies an outbound connection,
       all key-value pairs may be updated, except the above-mentioned
       two key-value pairs associated with inbound connection targets.
       They are omitted.

       <b>is_connected</b>: boolean
              <b>true </b>if currently connected to this manager, <b>false</b>
              otherwise.

       <b>status : last_error</b>: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the
              connection to the manager; i.e. <b>strerror(errno)</b>. This key
              will exist only if an error has occurred.

       <b>status : state</b>: optional string, one of <b>ACTIVE</b>, <b>BACKOFF</b>,
       <b>CONNECTING</b>, <b>IDLE</b>, or <b>VOID</b>
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              <b>VOID   </b>Connection is disabled.

              <b>BACKOFF</b>
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              <b>CONNECTING</b>
                     Attempting to connect.

              <b>ACTIVE </b>Connected, remote host responsive.

              <b>IDLE   </b>Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-
                     alive.

              These values may change in the future. They are provided
              only for human consumption.

       <b>status : sec_since_connect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this manager last successfully
              connected to the database (in seconds). Value is empty if
              manager has never successfully connected.

       <b>status : sec_since_disconnect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this manager last disconnected
              from the database (in seconds). Value is empty if manager
              has never disconnected.

       <b>status : locks_held</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection holds. Omitted if the connection does not hold
              any locks.

       <b>status : locks_waiting</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection is currently waiting to acquire. Omitted if the
              connection is not waiting for any locks.

       <b>status : locks_lost</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection has had stolen by another OVSDB client. Omitted
              if no locks have been stolen from this connection.

       <b>status : n_connections</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 2
              When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
              inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>) and more than
              one connection is actually active, the value is the number
              of active connections. Otherwise, this key-value pair is
              omitted.

       <b>status : bound_port</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              When <b>target </b>is <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>, this is the TCP port on
              which the OVSDB server is listening. (This is particularly
              useful when <b>target </b>specifies a port of 0, allowing the
              kernel to choose any available port.)

     <i>Connection Parameters:</i>

       Additional configuration for a connection between the manager and
       the Open vSwitch Database.

       <b>other_config : dscp</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) is specified
              using 6 bits in the Type of Service (TOS) field in the IP
              header. DSCP provides a mechanism to classify the network
              traffic and provide Quality of Service (QoS) on IP
              networks. The DSCP value specified here is used when
              establishing the connection between the manager and the
              Open vSwitch. If no value is specified, a default value of
              48 is chosen. Valid DSCP values must be in the range 0 to
              63.

       <i>Common Columns:</i>
         <b>external_ids                </b>map of string-string pairs

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>targets</b>: set of 1 or more strings
              NetFlow targets in the form <i>ip</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>. The <i>ip</i> must be
              specified numerically, not as a DNS name.

       <b>engine_id</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 255
              Engine ID to use in NetFlow messages. Defaults to datapath
              index if not specified.

       <b>engine_type</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 255
              Engine type to use in NetFlow messages. Defaults to
              datapath index if not specified.

       <b>active_timeout</b>: integer, at least -1
              The interval at which NetFlow records are sent for flows
              that are still active, in seconds. A value of <b>0 </b>requests
              the default timeout (currently 600 seconds); a value of <b>-1</b>
              disables active timeouts.

              The NetFlow passive timeout, for flows that become
              inactive, is not configurable. It will vary depending on
              the Open vSwitch version, the forms and contents of the
              OpenFlow flow tables, CPU and memory usage, and network
              activity. A typical passive timeout is about a second.

       <b>add_id_to_interface</b>: boolean
              If this column’s value is <b>false</b>, the ingress and egress
              interface fields of NetFlow flow records are derived from
              OpenFlow port numbers. When it is <b>true</b>, the 7 most
              significant bits of these fields will be replaced by the
              least significant 7 bits of the engine id. This is useful
              because many NetFlow collectors do not expect multiple
              switches to be sending messages from the same host, so
              they do not store the engine information which could be
              used to disambiguate the traffic.

              When this option is enabled, a maximum of 508 ports are
              supported.

Datapath TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Configuration for a datapath within <b>Open_vSwitch</b>.

       A datapath is responsible for providing the packet handling in
       Open vSwitch. There are two primary datapath implementations used
       by Open vSwitch: kernel and userspace. Kernel datapath
       implementations are available for Linux and Hyper-V, and selected
       as <b>system </b>in the <b>datapath_type </b>column of the <b>Bridge </b>table. The
       userspace datapath is used by DPDK and AF-XDP, and is selected as
       <b>netdev </b>in the <b>datapath_type </b>column of the <b>Bridge </b>table.

       A datapath of a particular type is shared by all the bridges that
       use that datapath. Thus, configurations applied to this table
       affect all bridges that use this datapath.

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>datapath_version</b>: string
              Reports the version number of the Open vSwitch datapath in
              use. This allows management software to detect and report
              discrepancies between Open vSwitch userspace and datapath
              versions. (The <b>ovs_version </b>column in the <b>Open_vSwitch</b>
              reports the Open vSwitch userspace version.) The version
              reported depends on the datapath in use:

              •      When the kernel module included in the Open vSwitch
                     source tree is used, this column reports the Open
                     vSwitch version from which the module was taken.

              •      When the kernel module that is part of the upstream
                     Linux kernel is used, this column reports
                     <b>&lt;unknown&gt;</b>.

              •      When the datapath is built into the <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
                     binary, this column reports <b>&lt;built-in&gt;</b>. A built-in
                     datapath is by definition the same version as the
                     rest of the Open vSwitch userspace.

              •      Other datapaths (such as the Hyper-V kernel
                     datapath) currently report <b>&lt;unknown&gt;</b>.

              A version discrepancy between <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>and the
              datapath in use is not normally cause for alarm. The Open
              vSwitch kernel datapaths for Linux and Hyper-V, in
              particular, are designed for maximum inter-version
              compatibility: any userspace version works with with any
              kernel version. Some reasons do exist to insist on
              particular user/kernel pairings. First, newer kernel
              versions add new features, that can only be used by new-
              enough userspace, e.g. VXLAN tunneling requires certain
              minimal userspace and kernel versions. Second, as an
              extension to the first reason, some newer kernel versions
              add new features for enhancing performance that only new-
              enough userspace versions can take advantage of.

       <b>ct_zones</b>: map of integer-<b>CT_Zone </b>pairs, key in range 0 to 65,535
              Configuration for connection tracking zones. Each pair
              maps from a zone id to a configuration for that zone. Zone
              <b>0 </b>applies to the default zone (ie, the one used if a zone
              is not specified in connection tracking-related OpenFlow
              matches and actions).

     <i>Capabilities:</i>

       The <b>capabilities </b>column reports a datapath’s features. For the
       <b>netdev </b>datapath, the capabilities are fixed for a given version
       of Open vSwitch because this datapath is built into the
       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>binary. The Linux kernel and Windows and other
       datapaths, which are external to OVS userspace, can vary in
       version and capabilities independently from <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

       Some of these features indicate whether higher-level Open vSwitch
       features are available. For example, OpenFlow features for
       connection-tracking are available only when <b>capabilities:ct_state</b>
       is <b>true</b>. A controller that wishes to determine whether a feature
       is supported could, therefore, consult the relevant capabilities
       in this table. However, as a general rule, it is better for a
       controller to try to use the higher-level feature and use the
       result as an indication of support, since the low-level
       capabilities are more likely to shift over time than the high-
       level features that rely on them.

       <b>capabilities : max_vlan_headers</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Number of 802.1q VLAN headers supported by the datapath,
              as probed by the <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>slow path. If the datapath
              supports more VLAN headers than the slow path, this
              reports the slow path’s limit. The value of <b>other-</b>
              <b>config:vlan-limit </b>in the <b>Open_vSwitch </b>table does not
              influence the number reported here.

       <b>capabilities : recirc</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If this is true, then the datapath supports recirculation,
              specifically OVS_KEY_ATTR_RECIRC_ID. Recirculation enables
              higher performance for MPLS and active-active load
              balancing bonding modes.

       <b>capabilities : lb_output_action</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              If this is true, then the datapath supports optimized
              balance-tcp bond mode. This capability replaces existing
              <b>hash </b>and <b>recirc </b>actions with new action <b>lb_output </b>and
              avoids recirculation of packet in datapath. It is
              supported only for balance-tcp bond mode in netdev
              datapath. The new action gives higher performance by using
              bond buckets instead of post recirculation flows for
              selection of member port from bond. By default this new
              action is disabled, however it can be enabled by setting
              <b>other-config:lb-output-action </b>in <b>Port </b>table.

     <i>Connection-Tracking Capabilities:</i>

       These capabilities are granular because Open vSwitch and its
       datapaths added support for connection tracking over several
       releases, with features added individually over that time.

       <b>capabilities : ct_state</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_STATE, which
              indicates support for the bits in the OpenFlow <b>ct_state</b>
              field (see <a href="../man7/ovs-fields.7.html">ovs-fields(7)</a>) other than <b>snat </b>and <b>dnat</b>, which
              have a separate capability.

              If this is false, the datapath does not support
              connection-tracking at all and the remaining connection-
              tracking capabilities should all be false. In this case,
              Open vSwitch will reject flows that match on the <b>ct_state</b>
              field or use the <b>ct </b>action.

       <b>capabilities : ct_state_nat</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              If true, it means that the datapath supports the <b>snat </b>and
              <b>dnat </b>flags in the OpenFlow <b>ct_state </b>field. The <b>ct_state</b>
              capability must be true for this to make sense.

              If false, Open vSwitch will reject flows that match on the
              <b>snat </b>or <b>dnat </b>bits in <b>ct_state </b>or use <b>nat </b>in the <b>ct </b>action.

       <b>capabilities : ct_zone</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_ZONE. If false,
              Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on the <b>ct_zone </b>field
              or that specify a nonzero zone or a zone field on the <b>ct</b>
              action.

       <b>capabilities : ct_mark</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_MARK. If false,
              Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on the <b>ct_mark </b>field
              or that set <b>ct_mark </b>in the <b>ct </b>action.

       <b>capabilities : ct_label</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              If true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_LABEL. If
              false, Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on the
              <b>ct_label </b>field or that set <b>ct_label </b>in the <b>ct </b>action.

       <b>capabilities : ct_orig_tuple</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              If true, the datapath supports matching the 5-tuple from
              the connection’s original direction for IPv4 traffic. If
              false, Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on <b>ct_nw_src</b>
              or <b>ct_nw_dst</b>, that use the <b>ct </b>feature of the <b>resubmit</b>
              action, or the <b>force </b>keyword in the <b>ct </b>action. (The latter
              isn’t tied to connection tracking support of original
              tuples in any technical way. They are conflated because
              all current datapaths implemented the two features at the
              same time.)

              If this and <b>capabilities:ct_orig_tuple6 </b>are both false,
              Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on <b>ct_nw_proto</b>,
              <b>ct_tp_src</b>, or <b>ct_tp_dst</b>.

       <b>capabilities : ct_orig_tuple6</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              If true, the datapath supports matching the 5-tuple from
              the connection’s original direction for IPv6 traffic. If
              false, Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on
              <b>ct_ipv6_src </b>or <b>ct_ipv6_dst</b>.

       <b>capabilities : masked_set_action</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports masked data in
              OVS_ACTION_ATTR_SET actions. Masked data can improve
              performance by allowing megaflows to match on fewer
              fields.

       <b>capabilities : tnl_push_pop</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports tnl_push and pop actions.
              This is a prerequisite for a datapath to support native
              tunneling.

       <b>capabilities : ufid</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_FLOW_ATTR_UFID. UFID
              support improves revalidation performance by transferring
              less data between the slow path and the datapath.

       <b>capabilities : trunc</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_TRUNC
              action. If false, the <b>output </b>action with packet truncation
              requires every packet to be sent to the Open vSwitch slow
              path, which is likely to make it too slow for mirroring
              traffic in bulk.

       <b>capabilities : nd_ext</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_ND_EXTENSIONS
              to match on ICMPv6 "ND reserved" and "ND option type"
              header fields. If false, the datapath reports error if the
              feature is used.

     <i>Clone Actions:</i>

       When Open vSwitch translates actions from OpenFlow into the
       datapath representation, some of the datapath actions may modify
       the packet or have other side effects that later datapath actions
       can’t undo. The OpenFlow <b>ct</b>, <b>meter</b>, <b>output </b>with truncation,
       <b>encap</b>, <b>decap</b>, and <b>dec_nsh_ttl </b>actions fall into this category.
       Often, this is not a problem because nothing later on needs the
       original packet.

       Such actions can, however, occur in circumstances where the
       translation does require the original packet. For example, an
       OpenFlow <b>output </b>action might direct a packet to a patch port,
       which might in turn lead to a <b>ct </b>action that NATs the packet
       (which cannot be undone), and then afterward when control flow
       pops back across the patch port some other action might need to
       act on the original packet.

       Open vSwitch has two different ways to implement this ``save and
       restore’’ via datapath actions. These capabilities indicate which
       one Open vSwitch will choose. When neither is available, Open
       vSwitch simply fails in situations that require this feature.

       <b>capabilities : clone</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CLONE
              action. This is the preferred option for saving and
              restoring packets, since it is intended for the purpose,
              but old datapaths do not support it. Open vSwitch will use
              it whenever it is available.

              (The OpenFlow <b>clone </b>action does not always yield a
              OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CLONE action. It only does so when the
              datapath supports it and the <b>clone </b>brackets actions that
              otherwise cannot be undone.)

       <b>capabilities : sample_nesting</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Maximum level of nesting allowed by OVS_ACTION_ATTR_SAMPLE
              action. Open vSwitch misuses this action for saving and
              restoring packets when the datapath supports more than 3
              levels of nesting and OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CLONE is not
              available.

       <b>capabilities : ct_eventmask</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath’s OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CT action
              implements the OVS_CT_ATTR_EVENTMASK attribute. When this
              is true, Open vSwitch uses the event mask feature to limit
              the kinds of events reported to conntrack update
              listeners. When Open vSwitch doesn’t limit the event mask,
              listeners receive reports of numerous usually unimportant
              events, such as TCP state machine changes, which can waste
              CPU time.

       <b>capabilities : ct_clear</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CT_CLEAR
              action. If false, the OpenFlow <b>ct_clear </b>action has no
              effect on the datapath.

       <b>capabilities : max_hash_alg</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Highest supported dp_hash algorithm. This allows Open
              vSwitch to avoid requesting a packet hash that the
              datapath does not support.

       <b>capabilities : check_pkt_len</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports
              OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CHECK_PKT_LEN. If false, Open vSwitch
              implements the <b>check_pkt_larger </b>action by sending every
              packet through the Open vSwitch slow path, which is likely
              to make it too slow for handling traffic in bulk.

       <b>capabilities : ct_timeout</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_CT_ATTR_TIMEOUT in the
              OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CT action. If false, Open vswitch cannot
              implement timeout policies based on connection tracking
              zones, as configured through the <b>CT_Timeout_Policy </b>table.

       <b>capabilities : explicit_drop_action</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b>
       or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_DROP. If
              false, explicit drop action will not be sent to the
              datapath.

       <b>capabilities : ct_zero_snat</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports all-zero SNAT. This is a
              special case if the <b>src </b>IP address is configured as all
              0’s, i.e., <b>nat(src=0.0.0.0)</b>. In this case, when a source
              port collision is detected during the commit, the source
              port will be translated to an ephemeral port. If there is
              no collision, no SNAT is performed.

       <b>capabilities : ct_flush</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports CT flush OpenFlow Nicira
              extension called <b>NXT_CT_FLUSH</b>. The <b>NXT_CT_FLUSH </b>extensions
              allows to flush CT entries based on specified parameters.

       <b>ct_zone_default_limit</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to
       4,294,967,295
              Default connection tracking zone limit that is applied to
              all zones that didn’t specify the <b>limit </b>explicitly. If the
              limit is unspecified the default limit configuration for
              the datapath is left intact. The value 0 means unlimited.

IPFIX TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Configuration for sending packets to IPFIX collectors.

       IPFIX is a protocol that exports a number of details about flows.
       The IPFIX implementation in Open vSwitch samples packets at a
       configurable rate, extracts flow information from those packets,
       optionally caches and aggregates the flow information, and sends
       the result to one or more collectors.

       IPFIX in Open vSwitch can be configured two different ways:

              •      With <b>per-bridge sampling</b>, Open vSwitch performs
                     IPFIX sampling automatically on all packets that
                     pass through a bridge. To configure per-bridge
                     sampling, create an <b>IPFIX </b>record and point a <b>Bridge</b>
                     table’s <b>ipfix </b>column to it. The
                     <b>Flow_Sample_Collector_Set </b>table is not used for
                     per-bridge sampling.

              •      With <b>flow-based sampling</b>, <b>sample </b>actions in the
                     OpenFlow flow table drive IPFIX sampling. See
                     <a href="../man7/ovs-actions.7.html">ovs-actions(7)</a> for a description of the <b>sample</b>
                     action.

                     Flow-based sampling also requires database
                     configuration: create a <b>IPFIX </b>record that describes
                     the IPFIX configuration and a
                     <b>Flow_Sample_Collector_Set </b>record that points to the
                     <b>Bridge </b>whose flow table holds the <b>sample </b>actions
                     and to <b>IPFIX </b>record. The <b>ipfix </b>in the <b>Bridge </b>table
                     is not used for flow-based sampling.

     <i>Per-Bridge Sampling:</i>

       These values affect only per-bridge sampling. See above for a

       <b>sampling</b>: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,294,967,295
              The rate at which packets should be sampled and sent to
              each target collector. If not specified, defaults to 400,
              which means one out of 400 packets, on average, will be
              sent to each target collector.

       <b>obs_domain_id</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              The IPFIX Observation Domain ID sent in each IPFIX packet.
              If not specified, defaults to 0.

       <b>obs_point_id</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              The IPFIX Observation Point ID sent in each IPFIX flow
              record. If not specified, defaults to 0.

       <b>other_config : enable-input-sampling</b>: optional string, either
       <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              By default, Open vSwitch samples and reports flows at
              bridge port input in IPFIX flow records. Set this column
              to <b>false </b>to disable input sampling.

       <b>other_config : enable-output-sampling</b>: optional string, either
       <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              By default, Open vSwitch samples and reports flows at
              bridge port output in IPFIX flow records. Set this column
              to <b>false </b>to disable output sampling.

AutoAttach TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Auto Attach configuration within a bridge. The IETF Auto-Attach
       SPBM draft standard describes a compact method of using IEEE
       802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) together with a IEEE
       802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) network to automatically
       attach network devices to individual services in a SPB network.
       The intent here is to allow network applications and devices
       using OVS to be able to easily take advantage of features offered
       by industry standard SPB networks.

       Auto Attach (AA) uses LLDP to communicate between a directly
       connected Auto Attach Client (AAC) and Auto Attach Server (AAS).
       The LLDP protocol is extended to add two new Type-Length-Value
       tuples (TLVs). The first new TLV supports the ongoing discovery
       of directly connected AA correspondents. Auto Attach operates by
       regularly transmitting AA discovery TLVs between the AA client
       and AA server. By exchanging these discovery messages, both the
       AAC and AAS learn the system name and system description of their
       peer. In the OVS context, OVS operates as the AA client and the
       AA server resides on a switch at the edge of the SPB network.

       Once AA discovery has been completed the AAC then uses the second
       new TLV to deliver identifier mappings from the AAC to the AAS. A
       primary feature of Auto Attach is to facilitate the mapping of
       VLANs defined outside the SPB network onto service ids (ISIDs)
       defined within the SPM network. By doing so individual external
       VLANs can be mapped onto specific SPB network services. These
       VLAN id to ISID mappings can be configured and managed locally
       using new options added to the ovs-vsctl command.

       The Auto Attach OVS feature does not provide a full
       implementation of the LLDP protocol. Support for the mandatory
       TLVs as defined by the LLDP standard and support for the AA TLV
       extensions is provided. LLDP protocol support in OVS can be
       enabled or disabled on a port by port basis. LLDP support is
       disabled by default.

       <b>mappings                      </b>map of integer-integer pairs, key
                                     in range 0 to 16,777,215, value in
                                     range 0 to 4,095

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>system_name</b>: string
              The system_name string is exported in LLDP messages. It
              should uniquely identify the bridge in the network.

       <b>system_description</b>: string
              The system_description string is exported in LLDP
              messages. It should describe the type of software and
              hardware.

       <b>mappings</b>: map of integer-integer pairs, key in range 0 to
       16,777,215, value in range 0 to 4,095
              A mapping from SPB network Individual Service Identifier
              (ISID) to VLAN id.
