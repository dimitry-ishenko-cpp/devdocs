DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These files configure the behavior of <a href="../man8/systemd-coredump.8.html">systemd-coredump(8)</a>, a
       handler for core dumps invoked by the kernel. Whether
       <b>systemd-coredump </b>is used is determined by the kernel's
       <i>kernel.core_pattern</i> <a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl(8)</a> setting. See <a href="../man8/systemd-coredump.8.html">systemd-coredump(8)</a>
       and <a href="core.5.html">core(5)</a> pages for the details.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE </h2>
<pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so
       configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from
       those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of
       the listed directories in order of priority, only the first file
       found is used: /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], /usr/lib/systemd/. The vendor
       version of the file contains commented out entries showing the
       defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can
       also be created by creating drop-ins, as described below. The
       main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose (or a
       copy in /etc/ if it's shipped under /usr/), however using
       drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over
       modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration
       snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/.
       Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main
       configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic
       order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside.
       When multiple files specify the same option, for options which
       accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last
       takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values,
       entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can
       install drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
       local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
       configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have
       to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to
       prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit
       number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a
       concept of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship
       drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range used by
       users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding
       accidentally drop-ins defined by users. It is recommended to use
       the range 10-40 for drop-ins in /usr/ and the range 60-90 for
       drop-ins in /etc/ and /run/, to make sure that local and
       transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by the OS
       vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the
       recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the
       configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the
       vendor configuration file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       All options are configured in the [Coredump] section:

       <i>Storage=</i>
           Controls where to store cores. One of "none", "external", and
           "journal". When "none", the core dumps may be logged
           (including the backtrace if possible), but not stored
           permanently. When "external" (the default), cores will be
           stored in /var/lib/systemd/coredump/. When "journal", cores
           will be stored in the journal and rotated following normal
           journal rotation patterns.

           When cores are stored in the journal, they might be
           compressed following journal compression settings, see
           <a href="journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf(5)</a>. When cores are stored externally, they will
           be compressed by default, see below.

           Note that in order to process a coredump (i.e. extract a
           stack trace) the core must be written to disk first. Thus,
           unless <i>ProcessSizeMax=</i> is set to 0 (see below), the core will
           be written to /var/lib/systemd/coredump/ either way (under a
           temporary filename, or even in an unlinked file), <i>Storage=</i>
           thus only controls whether to leave it there even after it
           was processed.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>Compress=</i>
           Controls compression for external storage. Takes a boolean
           argument, which defaults to "yes".

           Added in version 215.

       <i>ProcessSizeMax=</i>
           The maximum size in bytes of a core which will be processed.
           Core dumps exceeding this size may be stored, but the stack
           trace will not be generated. Like other sizes in this same
           config file, the usual suffixes to the base of 1024 are
           allowed (B, K, M, G, T, P, and E). Defaults to 1G on 32-bit
           systems, 32G on 64-bit systems.

           Setting <i>Storage=none</i> and <i>ProcessSizeMax=0</i> disables all
           coredump handling except for a log entry.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>ExternalSizeMax=</i>, <i>JournalSizeMax=</i>
           The maximum (compressed or uncompressed) size in bytes of a
           coredump to be saved in separate files on disk (default: 1G
           on 32-bit systems, 32G on 64-bit systems) or in the journal
           (default: 767M). Note that the journal service enforces a
           hard limit on journal log records of 767M, and will ignore
           larger submitted log records. Hence, <i>JournalSizeMax=</i> may be
           lowered relative to the default, but not increased. Unit
           suffixes are allowed just as in <b>ProcessSizeMax=</b>.

           <i>ExternalSizeMax=infinity</i> sets the core size to unlimited.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>MaxUse=</i>, <i>KeepFree=</i>
           Enforce limits on the disk space, specified in bytes, taken
           up by externally stored core dumps. Unit suffixes are allowed
           just as in <b>ProcessSizeMax=</b>.  <b>MaxUse= </b>makes sure that old core
           dumps are removed as soon as the total disk space taken up by
           core dumps grows beyond this limit (defaults to 10% of the
           total disk size).  <b>KeepFree= </b>controls how much disk space to
           keep free at least (defaults to 15% of the total disk size).
           Note that the disk space used by core dumps might temporarily
           exceed these limits while core dumps are processed. Note that
           old core dumps are also removed based on time via
           <a href="../man8/systemd-tmpfiles.8.html">systemd-tmpfiles(8)</a>. Set either value to 0 to turn off
           size-based cleanup.

           Added in version 215.

       The defaults for all values are listed as comments in the
       template /etc/systemd/coredump.conf file that is installed by
       default.

        1. ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£ Please note that those configuration files must

           partition, it may not be available during early boot, and
           must not be used for configuration.
