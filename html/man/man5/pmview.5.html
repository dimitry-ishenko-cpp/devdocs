NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmview </b>- configuration file format for performance
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This man page describes version 2.1 of the <b>pmview </b>configuration
       file format.

       The configuration format supports metrics from multiple hosts or
       archives.  A configuration file can specify metrics without a
       source, with different hosts and different archives.  However, a
       configuration file that contains archives may only have one
       archive for any one host.  When in ``replay'' mode, any metrics
       with host specific sources require an archive to be specified for
       that host on the command line or as a source to a previous
       metric.  The archive must be the same archive (based on a string
       comparison of the archive names) of any archives specified in the
       configuration file for the same host.

       The time controls will list all hosts that are specified on the
       command line and the configuration file in the timezone listing
       (see <a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a>).

       The configuration file format is based on a two-dimensional grid
       which can contain a variety of bars, stacks, links, pipes, labels
       and other grids.  The grids resize each column and row to match
       the size of the largest item in that column or row.  A
       configuration file that contains only one object does not require
       a grid. The <b>pmview </b>configuration file starts with an
       identification header in the first non-comment line:

          pmview Version 2.1 <i>[command_line]</i>

       The optional <i>command_line</i> should be the command line with which
       the tool was launched, if the configuration file has been
       generated by another tool.  This is useful for applications that
       are to be restarted automatically on the next login, after the
       user has logged out while <b>pmview </b>was still running.  Care should
       be taken to ensure that the command specified is either a full
       pathname or will be found on the PATH available at login.

       All lines which begin with ``#'' are treated as comments and
       ignored.  Otherwise, all spaces, tabs and newlines are treated as
       white space so multiple commands may be on the same line.

       The syntax for specifying values in the configuration file is
       consistent for all commands, namely:

       <i>color</i>
           A color must be either a <b>X</b>(1) color name, a <b>X</b>(1) numerical
           color, or three normalized <i>real</i> values representing the
           saturation of red, green and blue.  For example, the
           following colors are identical:

               red
               rgbi:1.0/0.0/0.0
               1.0 0.0 0.0

       <i>int</i> An integer.

       <i>metric</i>
           A metric consists of an optional source (host or archive),
           the metric name, an optional instance list immediately after
           name, followed by the maximum (or normalization value).  A
           colon (``:'') is used to separate a host name from the
           metric, and a forward slash (``/'') to separate an archive
           name from the metric.  Instances are enclosed in square
           brackets and comma separated.  Each instance may be enclosed
           in quotes.

           For example, some legal metrics are:

               kernel.all.cpu.idle 4000
               myhost:kernel.all.cpu.idle[cpu0,"cpu3"] 1000.0
               /path/to/myarchive/kernel.all.cpu.idle[cpu1] 1000

           To assist the process of matching instance names, two further
           comparisons are made beyond a simple string comparison.  If
           the instance name contains spaces, only the first word in the
           instance name is required to match the instance, assuming
           that the first word is unique.  If the first word is not
           unique, only the first matching instance will be selected.
           The second comparison occurs if the first word is a number
           with leading zeros.  Any leading zeros will be skipped before
           comparing the first word again.  This permits process ids
           used in the <i>proc</i> metrics to be easily matched, without
           specifying the entire instance name.  For example, to
           visualize the user and system time of <i>init</i> use the metric
           specification

               proc.psusage.utime[1]    1000
               proc.psusage.stime[1]    1000

       <i>name</i>
           A name for an object which may be referred to later in the
           configuration file.  Names must be a single word consisting
           of all alphanumeric characters, as well as underscores,
           dashes and colons.  It is recommended that names do not begin
           with an underscore as this may be interpreted as a keyword.

       <i>pos</i> This is the position of the object within the grid.  The
           syntax of a position is:

          [ [<i>x z</i>] [ [<i>width depth</i>] [<i>alignment</i>] ] ]

              <i>x</i>
           The horizontal coordinate (left to right) of the object,
           starting at 0.  The default <i>x</i> is 0.

              <i>z</i>
           The vertical coordinate (top to bottom) of the object,
           starting at 0.  The default <i>z</i> is 0.

              <i>width</i>
           The number of columns occupied by the object.  The default
           <i>width</i> is 1.

              <i>depth</i>
           The number of rows occupied by the object.  The default <i>depth</i>
           is 1.

              <i>alignment</i>
           The edge or corner that the object is aligned with.  Possible
           alignments include: <i>north</i>, <i>south</i>, <i>east</i>, <i>west</i>, <i>northeast</i>,
           <i>northwest</i>, <i>southeast</i>, <i>southwest</i> and <i>center</i>.  Abbreviations
           like <i>se</i> and <i>SE</i> are also accepted.  The default alignment is
           <i>center</i>.

           The size of an object may not be known as the number of
           instances for some metrics will vary between hosts and PMDA
           configurations.  Therefore, the position of the object can be
           used to specify the likely size of the object, so that the
           position of the surrounding objects is appropriately
           adjusted.

           The following are legal positions:

                     0 5
           The object is centered at grid position 0,5 occupying 1 grid
           square.

                     1 2 north
           The object is aligned with the north edge of position 1,2
           occupying 1 grid square.

                     2 2 2 1 east
           The object is aligned to the eastern edge of position 3,2 and
           occupies 2 grid squares (2,2 and 3,2).

       <i>string</i>
           A string is a series of characters enclosed in double quotes.
           A string may not contain newlines or escaped double quotes.

       There are several parameters that may affect the size, shape and
       color of objects when they are displayed.  These parameters are
       scoped so that they only alter objects defined later in the same
       scope.  Therefore, parameter settings at the top of a
       configuration file affect the entire scene, unless they are
       changed later in the file.  Most of these parameters are also
       resources.

       <b>_barLength </b><i>int</i>
           The side length of the <b>_bar </b>and <b>_stack </b>blocks.  Default is
           28.

       <b>_barHeight </b><i>int</i>
           The maximum height of a <b>_bar </b>and <b>_stack </b>blocks.  Default is
           80.

       <b>_baseColor </b><i>color</i>
           The color of <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid </b>and <b>_stack </b>base planes.  Default is
           rgbi:0.15/0.15/0.15.

       <b>_baseHeight </b><i>int</i>
           The height of <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid </b>and <b>_stack </b>base planes.  Default is
           2.

       <b>_gapWidth </b><i>int</i>
           The gap between blocks in a <b>_bar </b>object in the X-axis.  The
           default is 8.

       <b>_gapDepth </b><i>int</i>
           The gap between blocks in a <b>_bar </b>object in the Z-axis.  The
           default is 8.

       <b>_gapLabel </b><i>int</i>
           The gap between the base of a <b>_bar </b>object, and any metric or
           instance labels.  The default is 6.

       <b>_gridWidth </b><i>int</i>
           The minimum width of a <b>_grid </b>column.  The default is 20.

       <b>_gridDepth </b><i>int</i>
           The minimum depth of a <b>_grid </b>row.  The default is 20.

       <b>_labelMargin </b><i>int</i>
           The margin around a <b>_label </b>object.  The default is 5.

       <b>_labelColor </b><i>color</i>
           The color of <b>_label </b>and <b>_bar </b>labels.  The default is white.

       <b>_marginWidth </b><i>int</i>
           The extra width of a <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid </b>and <b>_stack </b>base plane beyond
           the objects on the plane.  The default is 8.

       <b>_marginDepth </b><i>int</i>
           The extra depth of a <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid </b>and <b>_stack </b>base plane beyond
           the objects on the plane.  The default is 8.

       <b>_pipeLength </b><i>int</i>
           Total length of a <b>_pipe.  </b>The default is the value of
           <b>_barHeight.</b>

       <b>_scale </b><i>real</i>
           The scale applied to the entire scene.  This parameter may
           not be used within any objects, only at the top of the
           configuration file.  The default is 1.0.

       To simplify the specification of colors, a <b>_colorList </b>and a
       <b>_colorScale </b>may be used to define colors for an object which has
       metrics associated with it, i.e.  <b>_bar</b>, <b>_stack </b>or <b>_pipe</b>.  A color
       list may be defined within an object, or named and defined at the
       top of a configuration file.  A named color list may then be
       referenced within multiple objects:

       <b>_colorList </b><i>name</i> <b>( </b><i>color</i> [<i>color</i>...] <b>)</b>
           Associate the <i>color</i>s with the color list <i>name</i>.  The
           assignment of colors to blocks depends on the type of an
           object.  For example, the color list called <i>foo</i> has the same
           color three times:

           _colorList foo ( red rgbi:1.0/0.0/0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 )

       <b>_colorScale </b><i>name color</i> <b>( </b><i>color real</i> [<i>color real</i>...] <b>)</b>
           Associate the <i>color</i>s and <i>real</i>s with the color list <i>name</i>.  The
           initial <i>color</i> is the default color of the object.  The object
           will change color to the other colors when the normalized
           value of the object is equal to or greater than each <i>real</i>.
           Therefore, each <i>real</i> must be larger than the previous <i>real</i>,
           and should be in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  This scale gradually
           changes from blue to red:

           _colorScale coldToHot blue ( rgbi:0.5/0.0/1.0 0.3
                                        purple 0.6
                                        rgbi:1.0/0.0/0.5 0.8
                                        red 0.95)

       There are several different object types which could be found in
       a <b>pmview </b>scene: <b>_bar</b>, <b>_stack</b>, <b>_pipe</b>, <b>_grid</b>, <b>_link</b>, and <b>_label</b>.
       There is also <b>_xing </b>which is a special type of the <b>_link</b>.  The
       <b>_bar</b>, <b>_stack </b>and <b>_pipe </b>objects are modulated by metric values, a
       <b>_label </b>is fixed text, <b>_link </b>and <b>_xing </b>are interconnects and a
       <b>_grid </b>is a container of objects, including other <b>_grid </b>objects,
       which controls the layout of the scene.  A <b>_grid </b>object is only
       required if there are two or more objects in the scene.

       <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid </b>and <b>_stack </b>objects may have base planes which provide
       a point of reference for the blocks as they change height.  A
       label can be applied to the base plane <b>_grid </b>object if it is
       <b>_shown </b>with:

               <b>_baseLabel </b><i>name</i>|<i>string</i>

       <b>_baseLabel </b>should be used within the scope of the relevant <b>_bar</b>,
       <b>_grid </b>or <b>_stack </b>object.  The first ``\n'' characters in the
       string will be replaced by a new line.  Subsequent ``\n''
       characters will be ignored.

       For a scene to be valid it must contain at least one modulated
       object.

       The objects are defined as:

       <b>_bar </b>[<i>options</i>] <b>( </b>[<i>metric-list</i>] [<i>color-list</i>] [<i>label-list</i>] <b>)</b>
           A <b>_bar </b>object represents a collection of blocks.  The number
           of blocks depends on the number of metrics and metric
           instances assigned to the object.  By default, the blocks are
           modulated by changing the height of each block.
           Alternatively, blocks may be modulated by changing color, or
           both height and color.  Each color in the <i>color-list</i> is
           assigned to each metric.  Therefore, multiple instances of
           the one metric will have the same color.  The <i>options</i> that
           may be passed to a <b>_bar </b>object are:

           <i>pos</i> The position of the <b>_bar </b>object within the current <b>_grid</b>
               object.

           <b>_col</b>|<b>_row</b>
               Position the blocks so that each instance is in a column
               (<b>_col</b>) or a row (<b>_row</b>).  This implies that each different
               metric is in a separate row or column, respectively.  The
               default is <b>_col</b>.

           <b>_show</b>|<b>_hide</b>
               Is the base plane visible? Default is <b>_show</b>.

           <b>_ymod</b>|<b>_colormod</b>|<b>_colorymod</b>
               Modulate the blocks by adjusting their height (<b>_ymod</b>),
               color (<b>_colormod</b>) or both height and color (<b>_colorymod</b>).

           <b>_cube</b>|<b>_cylinder</b>
               Set the shape of the blocks.  The default is <b>_cube</b>.

           <b>_groupbymetric</b>|<b>_groupbyinst</b>|<b>_groupbyrow|</b>|<b>groupbycol</b>
               Set the grouping of blocks when launching other tools.
               For tools like <a href="../man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a> some views may generate many
               small charts which cannot be drawn entirely within the
               screen.  Another problem is it may be more appropriate to
               generate charts with the same instance in each chart,
               rather then the same metric.  The group specifiers
               control the algorithm used so that a separate chart will
               be drawn for each <b>_metrics </b>specification
               (<b>_groupbymetric</b>), for the first, second etc. instance of
               each <b>_metric </b>(<b>_groupbyinst</b>), or by the rows and columns
               of the <b>_bar </b>object depending on <b>_row </b>or <b>_col</b>.  The
               default is <b>_groupbymetric</b>.

           The options must be specified in this order, although
           preceding options are not required.  Therefore, this is
           legal:

               _bar _hide _cylinder ( ... )

           The metrics, colors and labels are specified within the
           brackets in any order.  Only the <i>metric-list</i> is mandatory.

           <i>metric-list</i>
               A <b>_bar </b>metric list contains a list of metric names,
               normalization values and an optional label for the
               metric:

               <b>_metrics ( </b><i>metric real</i> [<i>string</i>] [<i>metric real</i> [<i>string</i>]...] <b>)</b>

           <i>color-list</i>
               A <b>_bar </b>color list may be a named color list that was
               defined earlier, or an unnamed color list.  A <b>_colorScale</b>
               list should be used when using <b>_colormod </b>or <b>_colorymod</b>
               modulation.  Therefore, the syntax for color lists within
               a <b>_bar </b>object are any of:

               <b>_colorList </b><i>name</i>
               <b>_colorList ( </b><i>color</i> [<i>color</i>...] <b>)</b>
               <b>_colorScale </b><i>name</i>
               <b>_colorScale </b><i>color</i> <b>( </b><i>color real</i> [<i>color real</i>...] <b>)</b>

           <i>label-list</i>
               In addition to labels for each metric in the <i>metric-list</i>,
               metric and instance labels may be defined using
               <b>_metriclabels </b>and <b>_instlabels </b>statements.  The position
               of the labels around the <b>_bar </b>object depends on the <b>_row</b>
               or <b>_col </b>orientation of metrics and instances, and whether
               the label is read <b>_towards </b>the <b>_bar </b>object, or <b>_away</b>.
               The default is <b>_towards</b>.

               <b>_metriclabels </b>[<b>_away</b>|<b>_towards</b>] <b>( </b><i>name</i>|<i>string</i> [<i>name</i>|<i>string</i>...] <b>)</b>
               <b>_instlabels </b>[<b>_away</b>|<b>_towards</b>] <b>( </b><i>name</i>|<i>string</i>
               [<i>name</i>|<i>string</i>...] <b>)</b>

       <b>_grid </b>[<i>pos</i>] [<b>_show</b>|<b>_hide</b>] <b>( </b><i>objects</i> <b>)</b>
           A <b>_grid </b>object is a container for objects, including other
           <b>_grid </b>objects.  The rows and columns of a <b>_grid </b>object are
           resized to the largest object in the row or column.  If an
           object spans multiple rows and/or columns, those rows and
           columns may be partly resized to contain the object.
           However, the resizing of rows and columns for objects
           occupying multiple rows and columns occurs after resizing for
           objects occupying only one grid square.

           A collision between objects occupying the same squares will
           be reported as an error message and the later object will be
           ignored.

           The options to a <b>_grid </b>object control the position (<i>pos</i>) of
           the <b>_grid </b>object in the parent <b>_grid</b>, and indicate whether to
           <b>_show </b>or <b>_hide </b>the <b>_grid </b>base plane.  By default, the base
           plane is hidden.

           The parameters described above may be specified within the
           brackets of a <b>_grid </b>object, however they only apply to the
           objects within the <b>_grid</b>, not the <b>_grid </b>itself.  For a
           parameter to be applied to a <b>_grid </b>object, it must be
           specified before the <b>_grid </b>object declaration.

       <b>_label </b>[<i>options</i>] <i>string</i>
           A <b>_label </b>object draws the contexts of <i>string</i> at the location,
           orientation and size specified in the <i>options</i>:

           <i>pos</i> The position of the <b>_label </b>object in the current <b>_grid</b>
               object.

           <b>_left</b>|<b>_right</b>|<b>_up</b>|<b>_down</b>
               The orientation of the <i>string</i>.  The direction indicates
               the direction the label is read.  Therefore, <b>_right </b>is
               the default since the string is read from left to right.

           <b>_small</b>|<b>_medium</b>|<b>_large</b>
               The font size.  The default is <b>_medium</b>.

       <b>_link </b><i>pos</i> [<i>string</i>]
           A <b>_link </b>object draws a straight or L-shaped horizontal round
           ``pipe'' with diameter equal to 80% of the <i>_baseHeight</i> of an
           enclosing <b>_grid</b>.  The properties of the object are defined by
           the options:

           <i>pos</i> sets both the position of the <b>_link </b>on the grid and its
               shape.  <b>_link </b>starts in the column and row on the <b>_grid</b>
               specified by first two numbers in the <i>pos</i> and spans the
               number of columns and rows set by the second two numbers.
               The <i>alignment</i> value is used to decide the orientation of
               the link (links are always aligned at the center): <i>east</i>
               and <i>west</i> links are straight and going from left to right,
               <i>north</i> and <i>south</i> links are straight and going from far end
               of the grid to near end, <i>northeast, northwest, southeast</i>
               and <i>southwest</i> links are L-shaped and connect the
               corresponding points of the compass, i.e. a <i>northeast</i>
               link takes on the general shape of the Latin letter
               ``L''.

           <i>string</i>
               sets the ``tag'' for the <b>_link </b>which will be displayed in
               the text window when the pointer is over the link.

       <b>_pipe </b><i>pos</i> <b>( </b>[<i>metric-list</i>] [<i>color-list</i>] [<i>tag</i>] <b>)</b>
           A <b>_pipe </b>object represent a set of cylinders, placed on top of
           each other and oriented parallel to the base plane. The
           diameter of a <b>_pipe </b>is equal to 80% of <i>_baseHeight</i>.  The
           number of blocks is dependent on the number of metric
           instances in the <i>metric-list</i>.  The colors in the <i>color-list</i>
           are assigned in turn to each cylinder in the <b>_pipe</b>.  The
           length of the <b>_pipe </b>is defined by the <i>_pipeLength</i>.

           <i>pos</i> defines the position of the <b>_pipe </b>on the enclosing <b>_grid</b>
               and its orientation with <i>alignment</i> field used to define
               at which end of the pipe to stack the colored cylinders.
               The cylinders are stacked at the corresponding point of
               the compass and the pipe's direction is from the point of
               the compass towards the center of the compass.  Only
               <i>east</i>, <i>west</i>, <i>north</i>, and <i>south</i> are valid values for the
               pipe's alignment.

       The metrics, colors and label may be specified within the
       brackets in any order.  Only the <i>metric-list</i> is mandatory.

       <i>metric-list</i>
           A <b>_pipe </b>metric list contains a list of metric names and
           normalization values:

           <b>_metrics ( </b><i>metric real</i> [<i>metric real</i>...] <b>)</b>

       <i>color-list</i>
           A <b>_pipe </b>color list may be named color list that was defined
           earlier, or an unnamed color list:

           <b>_colorList </b><i>name</i>
           <b>_colorList ( </b><i>color</i> [<i>color</i>...] <b>)</b>

       <i>tag</i> A <b>_pipe </b>may have a ``tag'' for the filler block (unanimated
           block on the ``other'' end of the pipe) which will be
           displayed in the text window when the pointer is over that
           end of the pipe.

           <b>_pipeTag </b><i>name</i>|<i>string</i>

       <b>_stack </b>[<i>options</i>] <b>( </b>[<i>metric-list</i>] [<i>color-list</i>] [<i>label</i>] <b>)</b>
           A <b>_stack </b>object represents a set of blocks placed vertically
           on top of each other.  The number of blocks is dependent on
           the number of metric instances in the <i>metric-list</i>.  The
           colors in the <i>color-list</i> are assigned to each block in the
           <b>_stack</b>.  By default, the height of the <b>_stack </b>will be the sum
           of the height of each block.  The <i>options</i> that may be passed
           to a <b>_stack </b>object are:

           <i>pos</i> The position of the <b>_stack </b>object within the current
               <b>_grid </b>object.

           <b>_show</b>|<b>_hide</b>
               Is the base plane visible? Default is <b>_show</b>.

           <b>_utilmod</b>|<b>_fillmod</b>
               Force the height of the stack to always be the maximum
               height.  This is achieved by normalizing the height of
               each block (<b>_utilmod</b>), or by adding a grey block to the
               top of the stack (<b>_fillmod</b>).

           <b>_cube</b>|<b>_cylinder</b>
               Set the shape of the blocks.  The default is <b>_cube</b>.

           The options must be specified in this order, although
           preceding options are not required.  Therefore, this is
           legal:

               _stack 1 1 _north _utilmod ( ... )

           The metrics, colors and label may be specified within the
           brackets in any order.  Only the <i>metric-list</i> is mandatory.

           <i>metric-list</i>
               A <b>_stack </b>metric list contains a list of metric names and
               normalization values:

               <b>_metrics ( </b><i>metric real</i> [<i>metric real</i>...] <b>)</b>

           <i>color-list</i>
               A <b>_stack </b>color list may be named color list that was
               defined earlier, or an unnamed color list:

               <b>_colorList </b><i>name</i>
               <b>_colorList ( </b><i>color</i> [<i>color</i>...] <b>)</b>

           <i>label</i>
               A <b>_fillmod </b>type <b>_stack </b>may have a label for the filler
               block:

               <b>_stackLabel </b><i>name</i>|<i>string</i>

       <b>_xing </b><i>col row columns rows dir1</i> ... <i>dir4</i>
           A <b>_xing </b>is a special kind of link which is used to draw a
           pair of links which cross each other. To convey the visual
           impression that the links do not join, one of the links is
           drawn as a ``broken'' cylinder.  <i>col</i> and <i>row</i> define the
           position on the enclosing grid.  <i>columns</i> and <i>rows</i> define the
           size of the bounding box. The end points of the crossing
           cylinders are placed exactly in the center of the corner
           cells of the bounding box and four small cylinders or stubs
           are used to join the perimeter of the bounding box with the
           end points on the crossing cylinders. Four <i>dir</i> values define
           the orientation of the stubs, starting at the upper left
           corner of the <b>_xing </b>and proceeding clockwise, such that
           respective stubs are used to join the point of the compass
           with the center on the cell (see example).
