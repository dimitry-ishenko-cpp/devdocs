       <b>debian/triggers</b>, <b>debian/</b><i>binary-package</i><b>.triggers</b>, <b>DEBIAN/triggers</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A package declares its relationship to some trigger(s) by
       including a <i>triggers</i> file in its control archive (i.e.
       <i>DEBIAN/triggers</i> during package creation).

       This file contains directives, one per line.  Leading and
       trailing whitespace and everything after the first <b># </b>on any line
       will be trimmed, and empty lines will be ignored.

       The trigger control directives currently supported are:

       <b>interest </b><i>trigger-name</i>
       <b>interest-await </b><i>trigger-name</i>
       <b>interest-noawait </b><i>trigger-name</i>
           Specifies that the package is interested in the named
           trigger.  All triggers in which a package is interested must
           be listed using this directive in the triggers control file.

           The “await” variants put the triggering package in triggers-
           awaited state depending on how the trigger was activated.
           The “noawait” variant does not put the triggering packages in
           triggers-awaited state, even if the triggering package
           declared an “await” activation (either with an <b>activate-await</b>
           or <b>activate </b>directive, or by using the <b>dpkg-trigger</b>
           <b>--no-await </b>command-line option).  The “noawait” variant
           should be used when the functionality provided by the trigger
           is not crucial.

       <b>activate </b><i>trigger-name</i>
       <b>activate-await </b><i>trigger-name</i>
       <b>activate-noawait </b><i>trigger-name</i>
           Arranges that changes to this package's state will activate
           the specified trigger.  The trigger will be activated at the
           start of the following operations: unpack, configure, remove
           (including for the benefit of a conflicting package), purge
           and deconfigure.

           The “await” variants only put the triggering package in
           triggers-awaited state if the interest directive is also
           “await”.  The “noawait” variant never puts the triggering
           packages in triggers-awaited state.  The “noawait” variant
           should be used when the functionality provided by the trigger
           is not crucial.

           If this package disappears during the unpacking of another
           package the trigger will be activated when the disappearance
           is noted towards the end of the unpack.  Trigger processing,
           and transition from triggers-awaited to installed, does not
           cause activations.  In the case of unpack, triggers mentioned
           in both the old and new versions of the package will be
           activated.

       Unknown directives are an error which will prevent installation
       of the package.

       The “-noawait” variants should always be favored when possible
       since triggering packages are not put in triggers-awaited state
       and can thus be immediately configured without requiring the
       processing of the trigger.  If the triggering packages are
       dependencies of other upgraded packages, it will avoid an early
       trigger processing run and make it possible to run the trigger
       only once as one of the last steps of the upgrade.

       The “-noawait” variants are supported since dpkg 1.16.1, and will
       lead to errors if used with an older dpkg.

       The “-await” alias variants are supported since dpkg 1.17.21, and
       will lead to errors if used with an older dpkg.

       When a package provides an <b>interest-noawait </b>directive, any
       activation will set the triggering package into “noawait” mode,
       regardless of the awaiting mode requested by the activation
       (either “await” or “noawait”).  When a package provides an
       <b>interest </b>or <b>interest-await </b>directive, any activation will set the
       triggering package into “await” or “noawait“ depending on how it
       was activated.
