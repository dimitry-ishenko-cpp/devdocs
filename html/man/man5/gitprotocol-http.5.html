NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gitprotocol-http - Git HTTP-based protocols
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;over-the-wire-protocol&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Git supports two HTTP based transfer protocols. A "dumb" protocol
       which requires only a standard HTTP server on the server end of
       the connection, and a "smart" protocol which requires a Git aware
       CGI (or server module). This document describes both protocols.

       As a design feature smart clients can automatically upgrade
       "dumb" protocol URLs to smart URLs. This permits all users to
       have the same published URL, and the peers automatically select
       the most efficient transport available to them.
</pre> <h2>
URL FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       URLs for Git repositories accessed by HTTP use the standard HTTP
       URL syntax documented by RFC 1738, so they are of the form:

           <a href="#">http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;?&lt;searchpart&gt;</a>

       Within this documentation the placeholder <b>$GIT_URL </b>will stand for
       the <a href="#">http://</a> repository URL entered by the end-user.

       Servers SHOULD handle all requests to locations matching
       <b>$GIT_URL</b>, as both the "smart" and "dumb" HTTP protocols used by
       Git operate by appending additional path components onto the end
       of the user supplied <b>$GIT_URL </b>string.

       An example of a dumb client requesting a loose object:

           $GIT_URL:     <a href="http://example.com:8080/git/repo.git">http://example.com:8080/git/repo.git</a>
           URL request:  <a href="http://example.com:8080/git/repo.git/objects/d0/49f6c27a2244e12041955e262a404c7faba355">http://example.com:8080/git/repo.git/objects/d0/49f6c27a2244e12041955e262a404c7faba355</a>

       An example of a smart request to a catch-all gateway:

           $GIT_URL:     <a href="http://example.com/daemon.cgi?svc=git&amp;q=">http://example.com/daemon.cgi?svc=git&amp;q=</a>
           URL request:  <a href="http://example.com/daemon.cgi?svc=git&amp;q=/info/refs&amp;service=git-receive-pack">http://example.com/daemon.cgi?svc=git&amp;q=/info/refs&amp;service=git-receive-pack</a>

       An example of a request to a submodule:

           $GIT_URL:     <a href="http://example.com/git/repo.git/path/submodule.git">http://example.com/git/repo.git/path/submodule.git</a>
           URL request:  <a href="http://example.com/git/repo.git/path/submodule.git/info/refs">http://example.com/git/repo.git/path/submodule.git/info/refs</a>

       Clients MUST strip a trailing <b>/</b>, if present, from the user
       supplied <b>$GIT_URL </b>string to prevent empty path tokens (<b>//</b>) from
       appearing in any URL sent to a server. Compatible clients MUST
       expand <b>$GIT_URL/info/refs </b>as <b>foo/info/refs </b>and not
       <b>foo//info/refs</b>.
</pre> <h2>
AUTHENTICATION </h2>
<pre>
       Standard HTTP authentication is used if authentication is
       required to access a repository, and MAY be configured and
       enforced by the HTTP server software.

       Because Git repositories are accessed by standard path components
       server administrators MAY use directory based permissions within
       their HTTP server to control repository access.

       Clients SHOULD support Basic authentication as described by RFC
       2617. Servers SHOULD support Basic authentication by relying upon
       the HTTP server placed in front of the Git server software.

       Servers SHOULD NOT require HTTP cookies for the purposes of
       authentication or access control.

       Clients and servers MAY support other common forms of HTTP based
       authentication, such as Digest authentication.
</pre> <h2>
SSL </h2>
<pre>
       Clients and servers SHOULD support SSL, particularly to protect
       passwords when relying on Basic HTTP authentication.
</pre> <h2>
SESSION STATE </h2>
<pre>
       The Git over HTTP protocol (much like HTTP itself) is stateless
       from the perspective of the HTTP server side. All state MUST be
       retained and managed by the client process. This permits simple
       round-robin load-balancing on the server side, without needing to
       worry about state management.

       Clients MUST NOT require state management on the server side in
       order to function correctly.

       Servers MUST NOT require HTTP cookies in order to function
       correctly. Clients MAY store and forward HTTP cookies during
       request processing as described by RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1). Servers
       SHOULD ignore any cookies sent by a client.
</pre> <h2>
GENERAL REQUEST PROCESSING </h2>
<pre>
       Except where noted, all standard HTTP behavior SHOULD be assumed
       by both client and server. This includes (but is not necessarily
       limited to):

       If there is no repository at <b>$GIT_URL</b>, or the resource pointed to
       by a location matching <b>$GIT_URL </b>does not exist, the server MUST
       NOT respond with <b>200 OK </b>response. A server SHOULD respond with
       <b>404 Not Found</b>, <b>410 Gone</b>, or any other suitable HTTP status code
       which does not imply the resource exists as requested.

       If there is a repository at <b>$GIT_URL</b>, but access is not currently
       permitted, the server MUST respond with the <b>403 Forbidden </b>HTTP
       status code.

       Servers SHOULD support both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1. Servers SHOULD
       support chunked encoding for both request and response bodies.

       Clients SHOULD support both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1. Clients SHOULD
       support chunked encoding for both request and response bodies.

       Servers MAY return ETag and/or Last-Modified headers.

       Clients MAY revalidate cached entities by including
       If-Modified-Since and/or If-None-Match request headers.

       Servers MAY return <b>304 Not Modified </b>if the relevant headers
       appear in the request and the entity has not changed. Clients
       MUST treat <b>304 Not Modified </b>identical to <b>200 OK </b>by reusing the
       cached entity.

       Clients MAY reuse a cached entity without revalidation if the
       Cache-Control and/or Expires header permits caching. Clients and
       servers MUST follow RFC 2616 for cache controls.
</pre> <h2>
DISCOVERING REFERENCES </h2>
<pre>
       All HTTP clients MUST begin either a fetch or a push exchange by
       discovering the references available on the remote repository.

   <b>Dumb Clients</b>
       HTTP clients that only support the "dumb" protocol MUST discover
       references by making a request for the special info/refs file of
       the repository.

       Dumb HTTP clients MUST make a <b>GET </b>request to <b>$GIT_URL/info/refs</b>,
       without any search/query parameters.

           C: GET $GIT_URL/info/refs HTTP/1.0

           S: 200 OK
           S:
           S: 95dcfa3633004da0049d3d0fa03f80589cbcaf31  refs/heads/maint
           S: d049f6c27a2244e12041955e262a404c7faba355  refs/heads/master
           S: 2cb58b79488a98d2721cea644875a8dd0026b115  refs/tags/v1.0
           S: a3c2e2402b99163d1d59756e5f207ae21cccba4c  refs/tags/v1.0^{}

       The Content-Type of the returned info/refs entity SHOULD be
       <b>text/plain; charset=utf-8</b>, but MAY be any content type. Clients
       MUST NOT attempt to validate the returned Content-Type. Dumb
       servers MUST NOT return a return type starting with
       <b>application/x-git-</b>.

       Cache-Control headers MAY be returned to disable caching of the
       returned entity.

       When examining the response clients SHOULD only examine the HTTP
       status code. Valid responses are <b>200 OK</b>, or <b>304 Not Modified</b>.

       The returned content is a UNIX formatted text file describing
       each ref and its known value. The file SHOULD be sorted by name
       according to the C locale ordering. The file SHOULD NOT include
       the default ref named <b>HEAD</b>.

           info_refs   =  *( ref_record )
           ref_record  =  any_ref / peeled_ref

           any_ref     =  obj-id HTAB refname LF
           peeled_ref  =  obj-id HTAB refname LF
                          obj-id HTAB refname "^{}" LF

   <b>Smart Clients</b>
       HTTP clients that support the "smart" protocol (or both the
       "smart" and "dumb" protocols) MUST discover references by making
       a parameterized request for the info/refs file of the repository.

       The request MUST contain exactly one query parameter,
       <b>service=$servicename</b>, where <b>$servicename </b>MUST be the service name
       the client wishes to contact to complete the operation. The
       request MUST NOT contain additional query parameters.

           C: GET $GIT_URL/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.0

       dumb server reply:

           S: 200 OK

       The client may send Extra Parameters (see <a href="gitprotocol-pack.5.html">gitprotocol-pack(5)</a>) as
       a colon-separated string in the Git-Protocol HTTP header.

       Uses the <b>--http-backend-info-refs </b>option to <a href="../man1/git-upload-pack.1.html">git-upload-pack(1)</a>.

       <b>Dumb Server Response</b>

           Dumb servers MUST respond with the dumb server reply format.

           See the prior section under dumb clients for a more detailed
           description of the dumb server response.

       <b>Smart Server Response</b>

           If the server does not recognize the requested service name,
           or the requested service name has been disabled by the server
           administrator, the server MUST respond with the <b>403 Forbidden</b>
           HTTP status code.

           Otherwise, smart servers MUST respond with the smart server
           reply format for the requested service name.

           Cache-Control headers SHOULD be used to disable caching of
           the returned entity.

           The Content-Type MUST be
           <b>application/x-$servicename-advertisement</b>. Clients SHOULD fall
           back to the dumb protocol if another content type is
           returned. When falling back to the dumb protocol clients
           SHOULD NOT make an additional request to <b>$GIT_URL/info/refs</b>,
           but instead SHOULD use the response already in hand. Clients
           MUST NOT continue if they do not support the dumb protocol.

           Clients MUST validate the status code is either <b>200 OK </b>or <b>304</b>
           <b>Not Modified</b>.

           Clients MUST validate the first five bytes of the response
           entity matches the regex <b>^[0-9a-f]{4}#</b>. If this test fails,
           clients MUST NOT continue.

           Clients MUST parse the entire response as a sequence of
           pkt-line records.

           Clients MUST verify the first pkt-line is <b>#</b>
           <b>service=$servicename</b>. Servers MUST set $servicename to be the
           request parameter value. Servers SHOULD include an LF at the
           end of this line. Clients MUST ignore an LF at the end of the
           line.

           Servers MUST terminate the response with the magic <b>0000 </b>end
           pkt-line marker.

           The returned response is a pkt-line stream describing each
           ref and its known value. The stream SHOULD be sorted by name
           according to the C locale ordering. The stream SHOULD include
           the default ref named <b>HEAD </b>as the first ref. The stream MUST
           include capability declarations behind a NUL on the first
           ref.

           The returned response contains "version 1" if "version=1" was
           sent as an Extra Parameter.

               smart_reply     =  PKT-LINE("# service=$servicename" LF)
                                  "0000"

   <b>The Negotiation Algorithm</b>
       The computation to select the minimal pack proceeds as follows (C
       = client, S = server):

       <i>init step:</i>

       C: Use ref discovery to obtain the advertised refs.

       C: Place any object seen into set <b>advertised</b>.

       C: Build an empty set, <b>common</b>, to hold the objects that are later
       determined to be on both ends.

       C: Build a set, <b>want</b>, of the objects from <b>advertised </b>that the
       client wants to fetch, based on what it saw during ref discovery.

       C: Start a queue, <b>c_pending</b>, ordered by commit time (popping
       newest first). Add all client refs. When a commit is popped from
       the queue its parents SHOULD be automatically inserted back.
       Commits MUST only enter the queue once.

       <i>one compute step:</i>

       C: Send one <b>$GIT_URL/git-upload-pack </b>request:

           C: 0032want &lt;want-#1&gt;...............................
           C: 0032want &lt;want-#2&gt;...............................

           ....
           C: 0000

       The stream is organized into "commands", with each command
       appearing by itself in a pkt-line. Within a command line, the
       text leading up to the first space is the command name, and the
       remainder of the line to the first LF is the value. Command lines
       are terminated with an LF as the last byte of the pkt-line value.

       Commands MUST appear in the following order, if they appear at
       all in the request stream:

       •   "want"

       •   "have"

       The stream is terminated by a pkt-line flush (<b>0000</b>).

       A single "want" or "have" command MUST have one hex formatted
       object name as its value. Multiple object names MUST be sent by
       sending multiple commands. Object names MUST be given using the
       object format negotiated through the <b>object-format </b>capability
       (default SHA-1).

       The <b>have </b>list is created by popping the first 32 commits from
       <b>c_pending</b>. Fewer can be supplied if <b>c_pending </b>empties.

       If the client has sent 256 "have" commits and has not yet
       received one of those back from <b>s_common</b>, or the client has
       emptied <b>c_pending </b>it SHOULD include a "done" command to let the
       server know it won’t proceed:

           C: 0009done

       S: Parse the git-upload-pack request:

       Verify all objects in <b>want </b>are directly reachable from refs.

       The server MAY walk backwards through history or through the
       reflog to permit slightly stale requests.

       If no "want" objects are received, send an error: TODO: Define
       error if no "want" lines are requested.

       If any "want" object is not reachable, send an error: TODO:
       Define error if an invalid "want" is requested.

       Create an empty list, <b>s_common</b>.

       If "have" was sent:

       Loop through the objects in the order supplied by the client.

       For each object, if the server has the object reachable from a
       ref, add it to <b>s_common</b>. If a commit is added to <b>s_common</b>, do not
       add any ancestors, even if they also appear in <b>have</b>.

       S: Send the git-upload-pack response:

       If the server has found a closed set of objects to pack or the
       request ends with "done", it replies with the pack. TODO:
       Document the pack based response

           S: PACK...

       The returned stream is the side-band-64k protocol supported by
       the git-upload-pack service, and the pack is embedded into stream
       1. Progress messages from the server side MAY appear in stream 2.

       Here a "closed set of objects" is defined to have at least one
       path from every "want" to at least one "common" object.

       If the server needs more information, it replies with a status
       continue response: TODO: Document the non-pack response

       C: Parse the upload-pack response: TODO: Document parsing
       response
