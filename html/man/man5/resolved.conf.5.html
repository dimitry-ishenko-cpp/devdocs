DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These configuration files control local DNS and LLMNR name
       resolution.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE </h2>
<pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so
       configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from
       those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of
       the listed directories in order of priority, only the first file
       found is used: /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], /usr/lib/systemd/. The vendor
       version of the file contains commented out entries showing the
       defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can
       also be created by creating drop-ins, as described below. The
       main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose (or a
       copy in /etc/ if it's shipped under /usr/), however using
       drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over
       modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration
       snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/.
       Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main
       configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic
       order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside.
       When multiple files specify the same option, for options which
       accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last
       takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values,
       entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can
       install drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
       local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
       configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have
       to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to
       prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit
       number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a
       concept of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship
       drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range used by
       users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding
       accidentally drop-ins defined by users. It is recommended to use
       the range 10-40 for drop-ins in /usr/ and the range 60-90 for
       drop-ins in /etc/ and /run/, to make sure that local and
       transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by the OS
       vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the
       recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the
       configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the
       vendor configuration file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are available in the [Resolve] section:

       <i>DNS=</i>
           A space-separated list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to use as
           system DNS servers. Each address can optionally take a port
           number separated with ":", a network interface name or index
           separated with "%", and a Server Name Indication (SNI)
           separated with "#". When IPv6 address is specified with a
           port number, then the address must be in the square brackets.
           That is, the acceptable full formats are
           "111.222.333.444:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv4 and
           "[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv6. DNS
           requests are sent to one of the listed DNS servers in
           parallel to suitable per-link DNS servers acquired from
           <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a> or set at runtime by external
           applications. For compatibility reasons, if this setting is
           not specified, the DNS servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf are
           used instead, if that file exists and any servers are
           configured in it. This setting defaults to the empty list.

           Added in version 213.

       <i>FallbackDNS=</i>
           A space-separated list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to use as
           the fallback DNS servers. Please see <i>DNS=</i> for acceptable
           format of addresses. Any per-link DNS servers obtained from
           <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a> take precedence over this
           setting, as do any servers set via <i>DNS=</i> above or
           /etc/resolv.conf. This setting is hence only used if no other
           DNS server information is known. If this option is not given,
           a compiled-in list of DNS servers is used instead.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>Domains=</i>
           A space-separated list of domains, optionally prefixed with
           "~", used for two distinct purposes described below. Defaults
           to the empty list.

           Any domains <i>not</i> prefixed with "~" are used as search suffixes
           when resolving single-label hostnames (domain names which
           contain no dot), in order to qualify them into
           fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs). These "search domains"
           are strictly processed in the order they are specified in,
           until the name with the suffix appended is found. For
           compatibility reasons, if this setting is not specified, the
           search domains listed in /etc/resolv.conf with the <i>search</i>
           keyword are used instead, if that file exists and any domains
           are configured in it.

           The domains prefixed with "~" are called "route-only
           domains". All domains listed here (<i>both search domains and</i>
           <i>route-only domains</i> after removing the "~" prefix) define a
           search path that preferably directs DNS queries to this
           interface. This search path has an effect only when suitable
           per-link DNS servers are known. Such servers may be defined
           through the <i>DNS=</i> setting (see above) and dynamically at run
           time, for example from DHCP leases. If no per-link DNS
           servers are known, route-only domains have no effect.

           Use the construct "~."  (which is composed from "~" to
           indicate a route-only domain and "."  to indicate the DNS
           root domain that is the implied suffix of all DNS domains) to
           use the DNS servers defined for this link preferably for all
           domains.

           See "Protocols and Routing" in <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a>
           for details of how search and route-only domains are used.

           Note that configuring the MulticastDNS domain "local" as
           search or routing domain has the effect of routing lookups
           for this domain to classic unicast DNS. This may be used to
           provide compatibility with legacy installations that use this
           domain in a unicast DNS context, against the IANA assignment
           of this domain to pure MulticastDNS purposes. Search and
           routing domains are a unicast DNS concept, they <i>cannot</i> be
           used to resolve single-label lookups via MulticastDNS.

           Added in version 229.

       <i>LLMNR=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument or "resolve". Controls Link-Local
           Multicast Name Resolution support (<b>RFC 4795</b>[2]) on the local
           host. If true, enables full LLMNR responder and resolver
           support. If false, disables both. If set to "resolve", only
           resolution support is enabled, but responding is disabled.
           Note that <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a> also maintains per-link
           LLMNR settings. LLMNR will be enabled on a link only if the
           per-link and the global setting is on.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>MulticastDNS=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument or "resolve". Controls Multicast DNS
           support (<b>RFC 6762</b>[3]) on the local host. If true, enables
           full Multicast DNS responder and resolver support. If false,
           disables both. If set to "resolve", only resolution support
           is enabled, but responding is disabled. Note that
           <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a> also maintains per-link Multicast
           DNS settings. Multicast DNS will be enabled on a link only if
           the per-link and the global setting is on.

           Added in version 234.

       <i>DNSSEC=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument or "allow-downgrade".

           If set to true, all DNS lookups are DNSSEC-validated locally
           (excluding LLMNR and Multicast DNS). If the response to a
           lookup request is detected to be invalid a lookup failure is
           returned to applications. Note that this mode requires a DNS
           server that supports DNSSEC. If the DNS server does not
           properly support DNSSEC all validations will fail.

           If set to "allow-downgrade", DNSSEC validation is attempted,
           but if the server does not support DNSSEC properly, DNSSEC
           mode is automatically disabled. Note that this mode makes
           DNSSEC validation vulnerable to "downgrade" attacks, where an
           attacker might be able to trigger a downgrade to non-DNSSEC
           mode by synthesizing a DNS response that suggests DNSSEC was
           not supported.

           If set to false, DNS lookups are not DNSSEC validated.

           Note that DNSSEC validation requires retrieval of additional
           DNS data, and thus results in a small DNS lookup time
           penalty.

           DNSSEC requires knowledge of "trust anchors" to prove data
           integrity. The trust anchor for the Internet root domain is
           built into the resolver, additional trust anchors may be
           defined with <a href="dnssec-trust-anchors.d.5.html">dnssec-trust-anchors.d(5)</a>. Trust anchors may
           change at regular intervals, and old trust anchors may be
           revoked. In such a case DNSSEC validation is not possible
           until new trust anchors are configured locally or the
           resolver software package is updated with the new root trust
           anchor. In effect, when the built-in trust anchor is revoked
           and <i>DNSSEC=</i> is true, all further lookups will fail, as it
           cannot be proved anymore whether lookups are correctly
           signed, or validly unsigned. If <i>DNSSEC=</i> is set to
           "allow-downgrade" the resolver will automatically turn off
           DNSSEC validation in such a case.

           Client programs looking up DNS data will be informed whether
           lookups could be verified using DNSSEC, or whether the
           returned data could not be verified (either because the data
           was found unsigned in the DNS, or the DNS server did not
           support DNSSEC or no appropriate trust anchors were known).
           In the latter case it is assumed that client programs employ
           a secondary scheme to validate the returned DNS data, should
           this be required.

           It is recommended to set <i>DNSSEC=</i> to true on systems where it
           is known that the DNS server supports DNSSEC correctly, and
           where software or trust anchor updates happen regularly. On
           other systems it is recommended to set <i>DNSSEC=</i> to
           "allow-downgrade".

           In addition to this global DNSSEC setting
           <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a> also maintains per-link DNSSEC
           settings. For system DNS servers (see above), only the global
           DNSSEC setting is in effect. For per-link DNS servers the
           per-link setting is in effect, unless it is unset in which
           case the global setting is used instead.

           Site-private DNS zones generally conflict with DNSSEC
           operation, unless a negative (if the private zone is not
           signed) or positive (if the private zone is signed) trust
           anchor is configured for them. If "allow-downgrade" mode is
           selected, it is attempted to detect site-private DNS zones
           using top-level domains (TLDs) that are not known by the DNS
           root server. This logic does not work in all private zone
           setups.

           Defaults to "allow-downgrade".

           Added in version 229.

       <i>DNSOverTLS=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument or "opportunistic". If true all
           connections to the server will be encrypted. Note that this
           mode requires a DNS server that supports DNS-over-TLS and has
           a valid certificate. If the hostname was specified in <i>DNS=</i> by
           using the format "address#server_name" it is used to validate
           its certificate and also to enable Server Name Indication
           (SNI) when opening a TLS connection. Otherwise the
           certificate is checked against the server's IP. If the DNS
           server does not support DNS-over-TLS all DNS requests will
           fail.

           When set to "opportunistic" DNS request are attempted to send
           encrypted with DNS-over-TLS. If the DNS server does not
           support TLS, DNS-over-TLS is disabled. Note that this mode
           makes DNS-over-TLS vulnerable to "downgrade" attacks, where
           an attacker might be able to trigger a downgrade to
           non-encrypted mode by synthesizing a response that suggests
           DNS-over-TLS was not supported. If set to false, DNS lookups
           are send over UDP.

           Note that DNS-over-TLS requires additional data to be send
           for setting up an encrypted connection, and thus results in a
           small DNS look-up time penalty.

           Note that in "opportunistic" mode the resolver is not capable
           of authenticating the server, so it is vulnerable to
           "man-in-the-middle" attacks.

           In addition to this global <i>DNSOverTLS=</i> setting
           <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a> also maintains per-link
           <i>DNSOverTLS=</i> settings. For system DNS servers (see above),
           only the global <i>DNSOverTLS=</i> setting is in effect. For
           per-link DNS servers the per-link setting is in effect,
           unless it is unset in which case the global setting is used
           instead.

           Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 239.

       <i>Cache=</i>
           Takes a boolean or "no-negative" as argument. If "yes" (the
           default), resolving a domain name which already got queried
           earlier will return the previous result as long as it is
           still valid, and thus does not result in a new network
           request. Be aware that turning off caching comes at a
           performance penalty, which is particularly high when DNSSEC
           is used. If "no-negative", only positive answers are cached.

           Note that caching is turned off by default for host-local DNS
           servers. See <i>CacheFromLocalhost=</i> for details.

           Added in version 231.

       <i>CacheFromLocalhost=</i>
           Takes a boolean as argument. If "no" (the default), and
           response cames from host-local IP address (such as 127.0.0.1
           or ::1), the result wouldn't be cached in order to avoid
           potential duplicate local caching.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>DNSStubListener=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument or one of "udp" and "tcp". If "udp",
           a DNS stub resolver will listen for UDP requests on addresses
           127.0.0.53 and 127.0.0.54, port 53. If "tcp", the stub will
           listen for TCP requests on the same addresses and port. If
           "yes" (the default), the stub listens for both UDP and TCP
           requests. If "no", the stub listener is disabled.

           The DNS stub resolver on 127.0.0.53 provides the full feature
           set of the local resolver, which includes offering
           LLMNR/MulticastDNS resolution. The DNS stub resolver on
           127.0.0.54 provides a more limited resolver, that operates in
           "proxy" mode only, i.e. it will pass most DNS messages
           relatively unmodified to the current upstream DNS servers and
           back, but not try to process the messages locally, and hence
           does not validate DNSSEC, or offer up LLMNR/MulticastDNS. (It
           will translate to DNS-over-TLS communication if needed
           however.)

           Note that the DNS stub listener is turned off implicitly when
           its listening address and port are already in use.

           Added in version 232.

       <i>DNSStubListenerExtra=</i>
           Takes an IPv4 or IPv6 address to listen on. The address may
           be optionally prefixed with a protocol name ("udp" or "tcp")
           separated with ":". If the protocol is not specified, the
           service will listen on both UDP and TCP. It may be also
           optionally suffixed by a numeric port number with separator
           ":". When an IPv6 address is specified with a port number,
           then the address must be in the square brackets. If the port
           is not specified, then the service uses port 53. Note that
           this is independent of the primary DNS stub configured with
           <i>DNSStubListener=</i>, and only configures <i>additional</i> sockets to
           listen on. This option can be specified multiple times. If an
           empty string is assigned, then the all previous assignments
           are cleared. Defaults to unset.

           Examples:

               DNSStubListenerExtra=192.168.10.10
               DNSStubListenerExtra=2001:db8:0:f102::10
               DNSStubListenerExtra=192.168.10.11:9953
               DNSStubListenerExtra=[2001:db8:0:f102::11]:9953
               DNSStubListenerExtra=tcp:192.168.10.12
               DNSStubListenerExtra=udp:2001:db8:0:f102::12
               DNSStubListenerExtra=tcp:192.168.10.13:9953
               DNSStubListenerExtra=udp:[2001:db8:0:f102::13]:9953

           Added in version 247.

       <i>ReadEtcHosts=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. If "yes" (the default),
           <b>systemd-resolved </b>will read /etc/hosts, and try to resolve
           hosts or address by using the entries in the file before
           sending query to DNS servers.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>ResolveUnicastSingleLabel=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When false (the default),
           <b>systemd-resolved </b>will not resolve A and AAAA queries for
           single-label names over classic DNS. Note that such names may
           still be resolved if search domains are specified (see
           <i>Domains=</i> above), or using other mechanisms, in particular via
           LLMNR or from /etc/hosts. When true, queries for single-label
           names will be forwarded to global DNS servers even if no
           search domains are defined.

           This option is provided for compatibility with configurations
           where <i>public DNS servers are not used</i>. Forwarding
           single-label names to servers not under your control is not
           standard-conformant, see <b>IAB Statement</b>[4], and may create a
           privacy and security risk.

           Added in version 246.

       StaleRetentionSec=<i>SECONDS</i>
           Takes a duration value, which determines the length of time
           DNS resource records can be retained in the cache beyond
           their Time To Live (TTL). This allows these records to be
           returned as stale records. By default, this value is set to
           zero, meaning that DNS resource records are not stored in the
           cache after their TTL expires.

           This is useful when a DNS server failure occurs or becomes
           unreachable. In such cases, <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.8.html">systemd-resolved(8)</a> continues to
           use the stale records to answer DNS queries, particularly
           when no valid response can be obtained from the upstream DNS
           servers. However, this doesn't apply to NXDOMAIN responses,
           as those are still perfectly valid responses. This feature
           enhances resilience against DNS infrastructure failures and
           outages.

           <b>systemd-resolved </b>always attempts to reach the upstream DNS
           servers first, before providing the client application with
           any stale data. If this feature is enabled, cache will not be
           flushed when changing servers.

           Added in version 254.
