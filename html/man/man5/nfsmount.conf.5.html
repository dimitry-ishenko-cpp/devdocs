NAME </h2>
<pre>
       nfsmount.conf - Configuration file for NFS mounts
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       Configuration file for NFS mounts that allows options to be set
       globally, per server or per mount point.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The configuration file is made up of multiple section headers
       followed by variable assignments associated with that section.  A
       section header is defined by a string enclosed by <b>[ </b>and <b>]</b>
       brackets.  Variable assignments are assignment statements that
       assign values to particular variables using the <b>= </b>operator, as in
       <b>Proto=Tcp</b>.  The variables that can be assigned are the set of NFS
       specific mount options listed in <a href="nfs.5.html">nfs(5)</a> together with the
       filesystem-independant mount options listed in <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> and three
       additions: <b>Sloppy=True </b>has the same effect as the <b>-s </b>option to
       <i>mount</i>, and <b>Foreground=True </b>and <b>Background=True </b>have the same
       effect as <b>bg </b>and <b>fg</b>.

       Options in the config file may be given in upper, lower, or mixed
       case and will be shifted to lower case before being passed to the
       filesystem.

       Boolean mount options which do not need an equals sign must be
       given as "<i>option</i>=True".  Instead of preceding such an option with
       "<b>no</b>" its negation must be given as "<i>option</i>=False".

       Sections are broken up into three basic categories: Global
       options, Server options and Mount Point options.

       <b>[ NFSMount_Global_Options ] </b>- This statically named section
              defines all of the global mount options that can be
              applied to every NFS mount.

       <b>[ Server "Server_Name" ] </b>- This section defines all the mount
              options that should be used on mounts to a particular NFS
              server. The <i>"Server_Name"</i> strings needs to be surrounded
              by '"' and be an exact match (ignoring case) of the server
              name used in the <b>mount </b>command.

       <b>[ MountPoint "Mount_Point" ] </b>- This section defines all the mount
              options that should be used on a particular mount point.
              The <i>"Mount_Point"</i> string needs to be surrounded by '"' and
              be an exact match of the mount point used in the <b>mount</b>
              command.  Though path names are usually case-sensitive,
              the Mount_Point name is matched insensitive to case.

       The sections are processed in the reverse of the order listed
       above, and any options already seen, either in a previous section
       or on the command line, will be ignored when seen again.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       These are some example lines of how sections and variables are
       defined in the configuration file.

       [ NFSMount_Global_Options ]
           Proto=Tcp

              The TCP/IPv4 protocol will be used on every NFS mount.

       [ Server "nfsserver.foo.com" ]
           rsize=32k
           wsize=32k
           proto=udp6

              A 32k (32768 bytes) block size will be used as the read
              and write size on all mounts to the 'nfsserver.foo.com'
              server.  UDP/IPv6 is the protocol to be used.

       [ MountPoint "/export/home" ]
           Background=True

              All mounts to the '/export/home' export will be performed
              in the background (i.e. done asynchronously).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/usr/etc/nfsmount.conf</i>
       <i>/usr/etc/nfsmount.conf.d/*.conf</i>
       <i>/etc/nfsmount.conf</i>
       <i>/etc/nfsmount.conf.d/*.conf</i>

              Default NFS mount configuration files, variables set in
              the later file over-ride those in the earlier file.
