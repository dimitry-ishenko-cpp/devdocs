NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-changelog - dpkg source packages' changelog file format
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debian/changelog</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Changes in the packaged version of a project are explained in the
       changelog file <i>debian/changelog</i>.  This includes modifications
       made in the source package compared to the upstream one as well
       as other changes and updates to the package.

       The format of the <i>debian/changelog</i> allows the package building
       tools to discover which version of the package is being built and
       find out other release-specific information.

       That format is a series of entries like this:

        <i>package</i> (<i>version</i>) <i>distributions</i>; <i>metadata</i>
                 [optional blank line(s), stripped]
         * <i>change-details</i>
           <i>more-change-details</i>
                 [blank line(s), included in <a href="../man1/dpkg-parsechangelog.1.html">dpkg-parsechangelog(1)</a>
       output]
         * <i>even-more-change-details</i>
                 [optional blank line(s), stripped]
         -- <i>maintainer-name</i> &lt;<i>email-address</i>&gt;  <i>date</i>

       <i>package</i> and <i>version</i> are the source package name and version
       number.  <i>version</i> is delimited by parenthesis U+00028 ‘<b>(</b>’ and
       U+0029 ‘<b>)</b>’.

       <i>distributions</i> lists one or more space-separated distributions
       where this version should be installed when it is uploaded; it is
       copied to the <b>Distribution </b>field in the <i>.changes</i> file.
       <i>distributions</i> must be terminated by a semicolon (U+003B ‘<b>;</b>’).

       <i>metadata</i> lists zero or more comma-separated <i>keyword</i>=<i>value</i> items.
       Each keyword can contain only minus and case insensitive
       alphanumeric characters, as they need to be mapped to <a href="deb822.5.html">deb822(5)</a>
       field names.  The only <i>keyword</i>s currently supported by <b>dpkg </b>are:

       <b>urgency</b>
           Its value is used for the <b>Urgency </b>field in the <i>.changes</i> file
           for the upload.

       <b>binary-only</b>
           With a <b>yes </b>value, it is used to denote that this changelog
           entry is for a binary-only non-maintainer upload (an
           automatic binary rebuild with the only change being the
           changelog entry).

       The change details may in fact be any series of lines starting
       with at least two spaces (U+0020 <b>SPACE</b>), but conventionally each
       change starts with an asterisk and a separating space and
       continuation lines are indented so as to bring them in line with
       the start of the text above.  Blank lines may be used here to
       separate groups of changes, if desired.

       If this upload resolves bugs recorded in the distribution bug
       tracking system, they may be automatically closed on the
       inclusion of this package into the distribution archive by
       including the string:

           <b>Closes: #</b><i>nnnnn</i>

       in the change details, where <b>#</b><i>nnnnn</i> is the bug number.  The exact
       Perl regular expression is:

           <b>/closes:\s*(?:bug)?\#?\s?\d+(?:,\s*(?:bug)?\#?\s?\d+)*/i</b>

       That is, the string should consist of the word <b>closes: </b>followed
       by a comma-separated list of bug numbers.  Bug numbers may be
       preceded by the word <b>bug </b>and/or a <b># </b>sign, as in "Closes: 42,
       bug#43, #44, bug 45".  The words <b>closes: </b>and <b>bug </b>are not case
       sensitive.  The list of bug numbers may span multiple lines.

       This information is conveyed via the <b>Closes </b>field in the <i>.changes</i>
       file.  Where, depending on the archive maintenance software, all
       the bug numbers listed might get automatically closed.

       The maintainer name and email address used in the changelog
       should be the details of the person who prepared this release of
       the package.  They are <b>not </b>necessarily those of the uploader or
       usual package maintainer.  The information here will be copied to
       the <b>Changed-By </b>field in the <i>.changes</i> file, and then later might
       be used to send an acknowledgment when the upload has been
       installed in the distribution archive.

       The <i>date</i> has the following format (compatible and with the same
       semantics of RFC2822 and RFC5322, or what «date -R» generates):

           <i>day-of-week</i><b>, </b><i>dd month yyyy hh</i><b>:</b><i>mm</i><b>:</b><i>ss</i> <b>+</b><i>zzzz</i>

       where:

       <i>day-of-week</i>
           Is one of: <b>Mon</b>, <b>Tue</b>, <b>Wed</b>, <b>Thu</b>, <b>Fri</b>, <b>Sat</b>, <b>Sun</b>.

       <i>dd</i>  Is a one- or two-digit day of the month (<b>01</b>-<b>31</b>), where the
           leading zero is optional, but conventionally does not get
           omitted.

       <i>month</i>
           Is one of: <b>Jan</b>, <b>Feb</b>, <b>Mar</b>, <b>Apr</b>, <b>May</b>, <b>Jun</b>, <b>Jul</b>, <b>Aug</b>, <b>Sep</b>, <b>Oct</b>,
           <b>Nov</b>, <b>Dec</b>.

       <i>yyyy</i>
           Is the four-digit year (e.g. 2010).

       <i>hh</i>  Is the two-digit hour (<b>00</b>-<b>23</b>).

       <i>mm</i>  Is the two-digit minutes (<b>00</b>-<b>59</b>).

       <i>ss</i>  Is the two-digit seconds (<b>00</b>-<b>60</b>).

       [<b>+-</b>]<i>zzzz</i>
           Is the time zone offset from Coordinated Universal Time
           (UTC).  ‘<b>+</b>’ indicates that the time is ahead of (i.e., east
           of) UTC and ‘<b>-</b>’ indicates that the time is behind (i.e., west
           of) UTC.  The first two digits indicate the hour difference
           from UTC and the last two digits indicate the number of
           additional minutes difference from UTC.  The last two digits
           must be in the range <b>00</b>-<b>59</b>.

       The first “title” line with the package name must start at the
       left hand margin.  The “trailer” line with the maintainer and
       date details must be preceded by exactly one space (U+0020
       <b>SPACE</b>).  The maintainer details and the date must be separated by
       exactly two spaces (U+0020 <b>SPACE</b>).  Each part of the <i>date</i> can be
       separated by one or more spaces (U+0020 <b>SPACE</b>), except after the
       comma where it can be separated by zero or more spaces (U+0020
       <b>SPACE</b>).

       Any line that consists entirely (i.e., no leading whitespace) of
       <b># </b>or <b>/* */ </b>style comments or RCS keywords.

       Vim modelines or Emacs local variables, and ancient changelog
       entries with other formats at the end of the file should be
       accepted and preserved on output, but their contents might be
       otherwise ignored and parsing stopped at that point.

       The entire changelog must be encoded in UTF-8.

         [ Guillem Jover ]
         * Handle empty minimum versions when initializing dependency versions,
           as the code is mapping the minimum version 0 to '' to avoid outputting
           useless versions. Regression introduced in dpkg 1.17.17. Closes: #764929

         [ Updated programs translations ]
         * Catalan (Guillem Jover).

         [ Updated dselect translations ]
