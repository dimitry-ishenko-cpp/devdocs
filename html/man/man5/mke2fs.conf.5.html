NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mke2fs.conf - Configuration file for mke2fs
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>mke2fs.conf</i> is the configuration file for <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>.  It controls
       the default parameters used by <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a> when it is creating
       ext2, ext3, or ext4 file systems.

       The <i>mke2fs.conf</i> file uses an INI-style format.  Stanzas, or top-
       level sections, are delimited by square braces: [ ].  Within each
       section, each line defines a relation, which assigns tags to
       values, or to a subsection, which contains further relations or
       subsections.  An example of the INI-style format used by this
       configuration file follows below:

            [section1]
                 tag1 = value_a
                 tag1 = value_b
                 tag2 = value_c

            [section 2]
                 tag3 = {
                      subtag1 = subtag_value_a
                      subtag1 = subtag_value_b
                      subtag2 = subtag_value_c
                 }
                 tag1 = value_d
                 tag2 = value_e
            }

       Comments are delimited by a semicolon (';') or a hash ('#')
       character at the beginning of the comment, and are terminated by
       the end of line character.

       Tags and values must be quoted using double quotes if they
       contain spaces.  Within a quoted string, the standard backslash
       interpretations apply: "\n" (for the newline character), "\t"
       (for the tab character), "\b" (for the backspace character), and
       "\\" (for the backslash character).

       Some relations expect a boolean value.  The parser is quite
       liberal on recognizing ``yes'', '`y'', ``true'', ``t'', ``1'',
       ``on'', etc. as a boolean true value, and ``no'', ``n'',
       ``false'', ``nil'', ``0'', ``off'' as a boolean false value.

       The following stanzas are used in the <i>mke2fs.conf</i> file.  They
       will be described in more detail in future sections of this
       document.

       <i>[options]</i>
              Contains relations which influence how mke2fs behaves.

       <i>[defaults]</i>
              Contains relations which define the default parameters
              used by <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>.  In general, these defaults may be
              overridden by a definition in the <b>fs_types </b>stanza, or by a
              command-line option provided by the user.

       <i>[fs_types]</i>
              Contains relations which define defaults that should be
              used for specific file system and usage types.  The file
              system type and usage type can be specified explicitly
              using the <b>-t</b>and<b>-T </b>options to <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>, respectively.

       <i>[devices]</i>
              Contains relations which define defaults for specific
              devices.
</pre> <h2>
THE [options] STANZA </h2>
<pre>
       The following relations are defined in the <i>[options]</i> stanza.

       <i>proceed_delay</i>
              If this relation is set to a positive integer, then mke2fs
              will wait <i>proceed_delay</i> seconds after asking the user for
              permission to proceed and then continue, even if the user
              has not answered the question.  Defaults to 0, which means
              to wait until the user answers the question one way or
              another.

       <i>sync_kludge</i>
              If this relation is set to a positive integer, then while
              writing the inode table, mke2fs will request the operating
              system flush out pending writes to initialize the inode
              table every <i>sync_kludge</i> block groups.   This is needed to
              work around buggy kernels that don't handle writeback
              throttling correctly.
</pre> <h2>
THE [defaults] STANZA </h2>
<pre>
       The following relations are defined in the <i>[defaults]</i> stanza.

       <i>creator_os</i>
              This relation specifies the "creator operating system" for
              the file system unless it is overridden on the command
              line.  The default value is the OS for which the <b>mke2fs</b>
              executable was compiled.

       <i>fs_type</i>
              This relation specifies the default file system type if
              the user does not specify it via the <b>-t </b>option, or if
              <b>mke2fs </b>is not started using a program name of the form
              <b>mkfs.</b><i>fs-type</i>.  If both the user and the <b>mke2fs.conf </b>file
              do not specify a default file system type, mke2fs will use
              a default file system type of <i>ext3</i> if a journal was
              requested via a command-line option, or <i>ext2</i> if not.

       <i>undo_dir</i>
              This relation specifies the directory where the undo file
              should be stored.  It can be overridden via the
              <b>E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR </b>environment variable.  If the directory
              location is set to the value <i>none</i>, <b>mke2fs </b>will not create
              an undo file.

       In addition, any tags that can be specified in a per-file system
       tags subsection as defined below (e.g., <i>blocksize</i>, <i>hash_alg</i>,
       <i>inode_ratio</i>, <i>inode_size</i>, <i>reserved_ratio</i>, etc.) can also be
       specified in the <i>defaults</i> stanza to specify the default value to
       be used if the user does not specify one on the command line, and
       the file system-type specific section of the configuration file
       does not specify a default value.
</pre> <h2>
THE [fs_types] STANZA </h2>
<pre>
       Each tag in the <i>[fs_types]</i> stanza names a file system type or
       usage type which can be specified via the <b>-t </b>or <b>-T </b>options to
       <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>, respectively.

       The <b>mke2fs </b>program constructs a list of fs_types by concatenating
       the file system type (i.e., ext2, ext3, etc.) with the usage type
       list.  For most configuration options, <b>mke2fs </b>will look for a
       subsection in the <i>[fs_types]</i> stanza corresponding with each entry
       in the constructed list, with later entries overriding earlier
       file system or usage types.  For example, consider the following
       <b>mke2fs.conf </b>fragment:

       [defaults]
            base_features = sparse_super,filetype,resize_inode,dir_index
            blocksize = 4096
            inode_size = 256
            inode_ratio = 16384

       [fs_types]
            ext3 = {
                 features = has_journal
            }
            ext4 = {
                 features = extents,flex_bg
                 inode_size = 256
            }
            small = {
                 blocksize = 1024
                 inode_ratio = 4096
            }
            floppy = {
                 features = ^resize_inode
                 blocksize = 1024
                 inode_size = 128
            }

       If mke2fs started with a program name of <b>mke2fs.ext4</b>, then the
       file system type of ext4 will be used.  If the file system is
       smaller than 3 megabytes, and no usage type is specified, then
       <b>mke2fs </b>will use a default usage type of <i>floppy</i>.  This results in
       an fs_types list of "ext4, floppy".   Both the ext4 subsection
       and the floppy subsection define an <i>inode_size</i> relation, but
       since the later entries in the fs_types list supersede earlier
       ones, the configuration parameter for fs_types.floppy.inode_size
       will be used, so the file system  will have an inode size of 128.

       The exception to this resolution is the <i>features</i> tag, which
       specifies a set of changes to the features used by the file
       system, and which is cumulative.  So in the above example, first
       the configuration relation defaults.base_features would enable an
       initial feature set with the sparse_super, filetype,
       resize_inode, and dir_index features enabled.  Then configuration
       relation fs_types.ext4.features would enable the extents and
       flex_bg features, and finally the configuration relation
       fs_types.floppy.features would remove the resize_inode feature,
       resulting in a file system feature set consisting of the
       sparse_super, filetype, dir_index, extents_and flex_bg features.

       For each file system type, the following tags may be used in that
       fs_type's subsection.   These tags may also be used in the
       <i>default</i> section:

       <i>base_features</i>
              This relation specifies the features which are initially
              enabled for this file system type.  Only one <i>base_features</i>
              will be used, so if there are multiple entries in the
              fs_types list whose subsections define the <i>base_features</i>
              relation, only the last will be used by <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>.

       <i>enable_periodic_fsck</i>
              This boolean relation specifies whether periodic file
              system checks should be enforced at boot time.  If set to
              true, checks will be forced every 180 days, or after a
              random number of mounts.  These values may be changed
              later via the <b>-i </b>and <b>-c </b>command-line options to
              <a href="../man8/tune2fs.8.html">tune2fs(8)</a>.

       <i>errors</i> Change the behavior of the kernel code when errors are
              detected.  In all cases, a file system error will cause
              <a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> to check the file system on the next boot.
              <i>errors</i> can be one of the following:

                   <b>continue</b>
                          Continue normal execution.

                   <b>remount-ro</b>
                          Remount file system read-only.

                   <b>panic  </b>Cause a kernel panic.

       <i>features</i>
              This relation specifies a comma-separated list of features
              edit requests which modify the feature set used by the
              newly constructed file system.  The syntax is the same as
              the <b>-O </b>command-line option to <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>; that is, a
              feature can be prefixed by a caret ('^') symbol to disable
              a named feature.  Each <i>feature</i> relation specified in the
              fs_types list will be applied in the order found in the
              fs_types list.

       <i>force_undo</i>
              This boolean relation, if set to a value of true, forces
              <b>mke2fs </b>to always try to create an undo file, even if the
              undo file might be huge and it might extend the time to
              create the file system image because the inode table isn't
              being initialized lazily.

       <i>default_features</i>
              This relation specifies set of features which should be
              enabled or disabled after applying the features listed in
              the <i>base_features</i> and <i>features</i> relations.  It may be
              overridden by the <b>-O </b>command-line option to <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>.

       <i>auto_64-bit_support</i>
              This relation is a boolean which specifies whether
              <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a> should automatically add the 64bit feature if
              the number of blocks for the file system requires this
              feature to be enabled.  The resize_inode feature is also
              automatically disabled since it doesn't support 64-bit
              block numbers.

       <i>default_mntopts</i>
              This relation specifies the set of mount options which
              should be enabled by default.  These may be changed at a
              later time with the <b>-o </b>command-line option to <a href="../man8/tune2fs.8.html">tune2fs(8)</a>.

       <i>blocksize</i>
              This relation specifies the default blocksize if the user
              does not specify a blocksize on the command line.

       <i>lazy_itable_init</i>
              This boolean relation specifies whether the inode table
              should be lazily initialized.  It only has meaning if the
              uninit_bg feature is enabled.  If lazy_itable_init is true
              and the uninit_bg feature is enabled,  the inode table
              will not be fully initialized by <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>.  This speeds
              up file system initialization noticeably, but it requires
              the kernel to finish initializing the file system in the
              background when the file system is first mounted.

       <i>lazy_journal_init</i>
              This boolean relation specifies whether the journal inode
              should be lazily initialized. It only has meaning if the
              has_journal feature is enabled. If lazy_journal_init is
              true, the journal inode will not be fully zeroed out by
              <b>mke2fs</b>.  This speeds up file system initialization
              noticeably, but carries some small risk if the system
              crashes before the journal has been overwritten entirely
              one time.

       <i>journal_location</i>
              This relation specifies the location of the journal.

       <i>num_backup_sb</i>
              This relation indicates whether file systems with the
              <b>sparse_super2 </b>feature enabled should be created with 0, 1,
              or 2 backup superblocks.

       <i>packed_meta_blocks</i>
              This boolean relation specifies whether the allocation
              bitmaps, inode table, and journal should be located at the
              beginning of the file system.

       <i>inode_ratio</i>
              This relation specifies the default inode ratio if the
              user does not specify one on the command line.

       <i>inode_size</i>
              This relation specifies the default inode size if the user
              does not specify one on the command line.

       <i>reserved_ratio</i>
              This relation specifies the default percentage of file
              system blocks reserved for the super-user, if the user
              does not specify one on the command line.

       <i>hash_alg</i>
              This relation specifies the default hash algorithm used
              for the new file systems with hashed b-tree directories.
              Valid algorithms accepted are: <i>legacy</i>, <i>half_md4</i>, and <i>tea</i>.

       <i>flex_bg_size</i>
              This relation specifies the number of block groups that
              will be packed together to create one large virtual block
              group on an ext4 file system.  This improves meta-data
              locality and performance on meta-data heavy workloads.
              The number of groups must be a power of 2 and may only be
              specified if the flex_bg file system feature is enabled.

       <i>options</i>
              This relation specifies additional extended options which
              should be treated by <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a> as if they were prepended
              to the argument of the <b>-E </b>option.  This can be used to
              configure the default extended options used by <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>
              on a per-file system type basis.

       <i>discard</i>
              This boolean relation specifies whether the <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>
              should attempt to discard device prior to file system
              creation.

       <i>cluster_size</i>
              This relation specifies the default cluster size if the
              bigalloc file system feature is enabled.  It can be
              overridden via the <b>-C </b>command line option to <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>

       <i>make_hugefiles</i>
              This boolean relation enables the creation of pre-
              allocated files as part of formatting the file system.
              The extent tree blocks for these pre-allocated files will
              be placed near the beginning of the file system, so that
              if all of the other metadata blocks are also configured to
              be placed near the beginning of the file system (by
              disabling the backup superblocks, using the
              packed_meta_blocks option, etc.), the data blocks of the
              pre-allocated files will be contiguous.

       <i>hugefiles_dir</i>
              This relation specifies the directory where huge files are
              created, relative to the file system root.

       <i>hugefiles_uid</i>
              This relation controls the user ownership for all of the
              files and directories created by the <i>make_hugefiles</i>
              feature.

       <i>hugefiles_gid</i>
              This relation controls the group ownership for all of the
              files and directories created by the <i>make_hugefiles</i>
              feature.

       <i>hugefiles_umask</i>
              This relation specifies the umask used when creating the
              files and directories by the <i>make_hugefiles</i> feature.

       <i>num_hugefiles</i>
              This relation specifies the number of huge files to be
              created.  If this relation is not specified, or is set to
              zero, and the <i>hugefiles_size</i> relation is non-zero, then
              <i>make_hugefiles</i> will create as many huge files as can fit
              to fill the entire file system.

       <i>hugefiles_slack</i>
              This relation specifies how much space should be reserved
              for other files.

       <i>hugefiles_size</i>
              This relation specifies the size of the huge files.  If
              this relation is not specified, the default is to fill the
              entire file system.

       <i>hugefiles_align</i>
              This relation specifies the alignment for the start block
              of the huge files.  It also forces the size of huge files
              to be a multiple of the requested alignment.  If this
              relation is not specified, no alignment requirement will
              be imposed on the huge files.

       <i>hugefiles_align_disk</i>
              This relations specifies whether the alignment should be
              relative to the beginning of the hard drive (assuming that
              the starting offset of the partition is available to
              mke2fs).  The default value is false, which will cause
              hugefile alignment to be relative to the beginning of the
              file system.

       <i>hugefiles_name</i>
              This relation specifies the base file name for the huge
              files.

       <i>hugefiles_digits</i>
              This relation specifies the (zero-padded) width of the
              field for the huge file number.

       <i>warn_y2038_dates</i>
              This boolean relation specifies whether mke2fs will issue
              a warning when creating a file system with 128 byte inodes
              (and so therefore will not support dates after January
              19th, 2038).  The default value is true, except for file
              systems created for the GNU Hurd since it only supports
              128-byte inodes.

       <i>zero_hugefiles</i>
              This boolean relation specifies whether or not zero blocks
              will be written to the hugefiles while <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a> is
              creating them.  By default, zero blocks will be written to
              the huge files to avoid stale data from being made
              available to potentially untrusted user programs, unless
              the device supports a discard/trim operation which will
              take care of zeroing the device blocks.  By setting
              <i>zero_hugefiles</i> to false, this step will always be skipped,
              which can be useful if it is known that the disk has been
              previously erased, or if the user programs that will have
              access to the huge files are trusted to not reveal stale
              data.

       <i>encoding</i>
              This relation defines the file name encoding to be used if
              the casefold feature is enabled.   Currently the only
              valid encoding is utf8-12.1 or utf8, which requests the
              most recent Unicode version; since 12.1 is the only
              available Unicode version, utf8 and utf8-12.1 have the
              same result.  <i>encoding_flags</i> This relation defines
              encoding-specific flags.  For utf8 encodings, the only
              available flag is strict, which will cause attempts to
              create file names containing invalid Unicode characters to
              be rejected by the kernel.  Strict mode is not enabled by
              default.

       <i>fs_type</i>
              This relation specifies the default parameter for the <b>-t</b>
              option, if this option isn't specified on the command
              line.

       <i>usage_types</i>
              This relation specifies the default parameter for the <b>-T</b>
              option, if this option isn't specified on the command
              line.
