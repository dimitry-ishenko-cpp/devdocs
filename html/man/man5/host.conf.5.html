NAME </h2>
<pre>
       host.conf - resolver configuration file
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The file <i>/etc/host.conf</i> contains configuration information
       specific to the resolver library.  It should contain one
       configuration keyword per line, followed by appropriate
       configuration information.  The following keywords are
       recognized:

       <i>trim</i>   This keyword may be listed more than once.  Each time it
              should be followed by a list of domains, separated by
              colons (':'), semicolons (';') or commas (','), with the
              leading dot.  When set, the resolver library will
              automatically trim the given domain name from the end of
              any hostname resolved via DNS.  This is intended for use
              with local hosts and domains.  (Related note: <i>trim</i> will
              not affect hostnames gathered via NIS or the <a href="hosts.5.html">hosts(5)</a>
              file.  Care should be taken to ensure that the first
              hostname for each entry in the hosts file is fully
              qualified or unqualified, as appropriate for the local
              installation.)

       <i>multi</i>  Valid values are <i>on</i> and <i>off</i>.  If set to <i>on</i>, the resolver
              library will return all valid addresses for a host that
              appears in the <i>/etc/hosts</i> file, instead of only the first.
              This is <i>off</i> by default, as it may cause a substantial
              performance loss at sites with large hosts files.

       <i>reorder</i>
              Valid values are <i>on</i> and <i>off</i>.  If set to <i>on</i>, the resolver
              library will attempt to reorder host addresses so that
              local addresses (i.e., on the same subnet) are listed
              first when a <a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname(3)</a> is performed.  Reordering is
              done for all lookup methods.  The default value is <i>off</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables can be used to allow users to
       override the behavior which is configured in <i>/etc/host.conf</i>:

       <b>RESOLV_HOST_CONF</b>
              If set, this variable points to a file that should be read
              instead of <i>/etc/host.conf</i>.

       <b>RESOLV_MULTI</b>
              Overrides the <i>multi</i> command.

       <b>RESOLV_REORDER</b>
              Overrides the <i>reorder</i> command.

       <b>RESOLV_ADD_TRIM_DOMAINS</b>
              A list of domains, separated by colons (':'), semicolons
              (';'), or commas (','), with the leading dot, which will
              be added to the list of domains that should be trimmed.

       <b>RESOLV_OVERRIDE_TRIM_DOMAINS</b>
              A list of domains, separated by colons (':'), semicolons
              (';'), or commas (','), with the leading dot, which will
              replace the list of domains that should be trimmed.
              Overrides the <i>trim</i> command.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/host.conf</i>
              Resolver configuration file

       <i>/etc/resolv.conf</i>
              Resolver configuration file

       <i>/etc/hosts</i>
              Local hosts database
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The following differences exist compared to the original
       implementation.  A new command <i>spoof</i> and a new environment
       variable <b>RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK </b>can take arguments like <i>off</i>, <i>nowarn</i>,
       and <i>warn</i>.  Line comments can appear anywhere and not only at the
       beginning of a line.

   <b>Historical</b>
       The <a href="nsswitch.conf.5.html">nsswitch.conf(5)</a> file is the modern way of controlling the
       order of host lookups.

       In glibc 2.4 and earlier, the following keyword is recognized:

       <i>order</i>  This keyword specifies how host lookups are to be
              performed.  It should be followed by one or more lookup
              methods, separated by commas.  Valid methods are <i>bind</i>,
              <i>hosts</i>, and <i>nis</i>.

       <b>RESOLV_SERV_ORDER</b>
              Overrides the <i>order</i> command.

       Since glibc 2.0.7, and up through glibc 2.24, the following
       keywords and environment variable have been recognized but never
       implemented:

       <i>nospoof</i>
              Valid values are <i>on</i> and <i>off</i>.  If set to <i>on</i>, the resolver
              library will attempt to prevent hostname spoofing to
              enhance the security of <b>rlogin </b>and <b>rsh</b>.  It works as
              follows: after performing a host address lookup, the
              resolver library will perform a hostname lookup for that
              address.  If the two hostnames do not match, the query
              fails.  The default value is <i>off</i>.

       <i>spoofalert</i>
              Valid values are <i>on</i> and <i>off</i>.  If this option is set to <i>on</i>
              and the <i>nospoof</i> option is also set, the resolver library
              will log a warning of the error via the syslog facility.
              The default value is <i>off</i>.

       <i>spoof</i>  Valid values are <i>off</i>, <i>nowarn</i>, and <i>warn</i>.  If this option is
              set to <i>off</i>, spoofed addresses are permitted and no
              warnings will be emitted via the syslog facility.  If this
              option is set to <i>warn</i>, the resolver library will attempt
              to prevent hostname spoofing to enhance the security and
              log a warning of the error via the syslog facility.  If
              this option is set to <i>nowarn</i>, the resolver library will
              attempt to prevent hostname spoofing to enhance the
              security but not emit warnings via the syslog facility.
              Setting this option to anything else is equal to setting
              it to <i>nowarn</i>.

       <b>RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK</b>
              Overrides the <i>nospoof</i>, <i>spoofalert</i>, and <i>spoof</i> commands in
              the same way as the <i>spoof</i> command is parsed.  Valid values
              are <i>off</i>, <i>nowarn</i>, and <i>warn</i>.
