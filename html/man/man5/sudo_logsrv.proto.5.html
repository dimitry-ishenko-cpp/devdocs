NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sudo_logsrv.proto </b>— Sudo log server protocol
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Starting with version 1.9.0, <b>sudo </b>supports sending event and I/O
       logs to a log server.  The protocol used is written in Google's
       Protocol Buffers domain specific language.  The “EXAMPLES”
       section includes a complete description of the protocol in
       Protocol Buffers format.

       Because there is no way to determine message boundaries when
       using Protocol Buffers, the wire size of each message is sent
       immediately preceding the message itself as a 32-bit unsigned
       integer in network byte order.  This is referred to as
       “length-prefix framing” and is how Google suggests handling the
       lack of message delimiters.

       The protocol is made up of two basic messages, <i>ClientMessage</i> and
       <i>ServerMessage</i>, described below.  The server must accept messages
       up to two megabytes in size.  The server may return an error if
       the client tries to send a message larger than two megabytes.
</pre> <h2>
Client Messages </h2>
<pre>
       A <i>ClientMessage</i> is a container used to encapsulate all the
       possible message types a client may send to the server.

       message ClientMessage {
         oneof type {
           AcceptMessage accept_msg = 1;
           RejectMessage reject_msg = 2;
           ExitMessage exit_msg = 3;
           RestartMessage restart_msg = 4;
           AlertMessage alert_msg = 5;
           IoBuffer ttyin_buf = 6;
           IoBuffer ttyout_buf = 7;
           IoBuffer stdin_buf = 8;
           IoBuffer stdout_buf = 9;
           IoBuffer stderr_buf = 10;
           ChangeWindowSize winsize_event = 11;
           CommandSuspend suspend_event = 12;
           ClientHello hello_msg = 13;
         }
       }

       The different <i>ClientMessage</i> sub-messages the client may sent to
       the server are described below.

   <b>TimeSpec</b>
       message TimeSpec {
           int64 tv_sec = 1;
           int32 tv_nsec = 2;
       }

       A <i>TimeSpec</i> is the equivalent of a POSIX <i>struct timespec</i>,
       containing seconds and nanoseconds members.  The <i>tv_sec</i> member is
       a 64-bit integer to support dates after the year 2038.

   <b>InfoMessage</b>
       message InfoMessage {
         message StringList {
           repeated string strings = 1;
         }
         message NumberList {
           repeated int64 numbers = 1;
         }
         string key = 1;
         oneof value {
           int64 numval = 2;
           string strval = 3;
           StringList strlistval = 4;
           NumberList numlistval = 5;
         }
       }

       An <i>InfoMessage</i> is used to represent information about the
       invoking user as well as the execution environment the command
       runs in the form of key-value pairs.  The key is always a string
       but the value may be a 64-bit integer, a string, an array of
       strings, or an array of 64-bit integers.  The event log data is
       composed of <i>InfoMessage</i> entries.  See the “EVENT LOG VARIABLES”
       section for more information.

   <b>ClientHello hello_msg</b>
       message ClientHello {
         string client_id = 1;
       }

       A <i>ClientHello</i> message consists of client information that may be
       sent to the server when the client first connects.

       client_id
               A free-form client description.  This usually includes
               the name and version of the client implementation.

   <b>AcceptMessage accept_msg</b>
       message AcceptMessage {
         TimeSpec submit_time = 1;
         repeated InfoMessage info_msgs = 2;
         bool expect_iobufs = 3;
       }

       An <i>AcceptMessage</i> is sent by the client when a command is allowed
       by the security policy.  It contains the following members:

       submit_time
               The wall clock time when the command was submitted to the
               security policy.

       info_msgs
               An array of <i>InfoMessage</i> describing the user who submitted
               the command as well as the execution environment of the
               command.  This information is used to generate an event
               log entry and may also be used by server to determine
               where and how the I/O log is stored.

       expect_iobufs
               Set to true if the server should expect <i>IoBuffer</i> messages
               to follow (for I/O logging) or false if the server should
               only store the event log.

       If an <i>AcceptMessage</i> is sent, the client must not send a
       <i>RejectMessage</i> or <i>RestartMessage</i>.

   <b>RejectMessage reject_msg</b>
       message RejectMessage {
         TimeSpec submit_time = 1;
         string reason = 2;
         repeated InfoMessage info_msgs = 3;
       }

       A <i>RejectMessage</i> is sent by the client when a command is denied by
       the security policy.  It contains the following members:

       submit_time
               The wall clock time when the command was submitted to the
               security policy.

       reason  The reason the security policy gave for denying the
               command.

       info_msgs
               An array of <i>InfoMessage</i> describing the user who submitted
               the command as well as the execution environment of the
               command.  This information is used to generate an event
               log entry.

       If a <i>RejectMessage</i> is sent, the client must not send an
       <i>AcceptMessage</i> or <i>RestartMessage</i>.

   <b>ExitMessage exit_msg</b>
       message ExitMessage {
         TimeSpec run_time = 1;
         int32 exit_value = 2;
         bool dumped_core = 3;
         string signal = 4;
         string error = 5;
       }

       An <i>ExitMessage</i> is sent by the client after the command has exited
       or has been terminated by a signal.  It contains the following
       members:

       run_time
               The total amount of elapsed time since the command
               started, calculated using a monotonic clock where
               possible.  This is not the wall clock time.

       exit_value
               The command's exit value in the range 0-255.

       dumped_core
               True if the command was terminated by a signal and dumped
               core.

       signal  If the command was terminated by a signal, this is set to
               the name of the signal without the leading “SIG”.  For
               example, INT, TERM, KILL, SEGV.

       error   A message from the client indicating that the command was
               terminated unexpectedly due to an error.

       When performing I/O logging, the client should wait for a
       <i>commit_point</i> corresponding to the final <i>IoBuffer</i> before closing
       the connection unless the final <i>commit_point</i> has already been
       received.

   <b>RestartMessage restart_msg</b>
       message RestartMessage {
         string log_id = 1;
         TimeSpec resume_point = 2;
       }

       A <i>RestartMessage</i> is sent by the client to resume sending an
       existing I/O log that was previously interrupted.  It contains
       the following members:

       log_id  The the server-side name for an I/O log that was
               previously sent to the client by the server.  This may be
               a path name on the server or some other kind of server-
               side identifier.

       resume_point
               The point in time after which to resume the I/O log.
               This is in the form of a <i>TimeSpec</i> representing the amount
               of time since the command started, not the wall clock
               time.  The <i>resume_point</i> should correspond to a
               <i>commit_point</i> previously sent to the client by the server.
               If the server receives a <i>RestartMessage</i> containing a
               <i>resume_point</i> it has not previously seen, an error will be
               returned to the client and the connection will be
               dropped.

       If a <i>RestartMessage</i> is sent, the client must not send an
       <i>AcceptMessage</i> or <i>RejectMessage</i>.

   <b>AlertMessage alert_msg</b>
       message AlertMessage {
         TimeSpec alert_time = 1;
         string reason = 2;
         repeated InfoMessage info_msgs = 3;
       }

       An <i>AlertMessage</i> is sent by the client to indicate a problem
       detected by the security policy while the command is running that
       should be stored in the event log.  It contains the following
       members:

       alert_time
               The wall clock time when the alert occurred.

       reason  The reason for the alert.

       info_msgs
               An optional array of <i>InfoMessage</i> describing the user who
               submitted the command as well as the execution
               environment of the command.  This information is used to
               generate an event log entry.

   <b>IoBuffer ttyin_buf </b>| <b>ttyout_buf </b>| <b>stdin_buf </b>| <b>stdout_buf </b>| <b>stderr_buf</b>
       message IoBuffer {
         TimeSpec delay = 1;
         bytes data = 2;
       }

       An <i>IoBuffer</i> is used to represent data from terminal input,
       terminal output, standard input, standard output, or standard
       error.  It contains the following members:

       delay   The elapsed time since the last record in the form of a
               <i>TimeSpec</i>.  The <i>delay</i> should be calculated using a
               monotonic clock where possible.

       data    The binary I/O log data from terminal input, terminal
               output, standard input, standard output, or standard
               error.

   <b>ChangeWindowSize winsize_event</b>
       message ChangeWindowSize {
         TimeSpec delay = 1;
         int32 rows = 2;
         int32 cols = 3;
       }

       A <i>ChangeWindowSize</i> message is sent by the client when the
       terminal running the command changes size.  It contains the
       following members:

       delay   The elapsed time since the last record in the form of a
               <i>TimeSpec</i>.  The <i>delay</i> should be calculated using a
               monotonic clock where possible.

       rows    The new number of terminal rows.

       cols    The new number of terminal columns.

   <b>CommandSuspend suspend_event</b>
       message CommandSuspend {
         TimeSpec delay = 1;
         string signal = 2;
       }

       A <i>CommandSuspend</i> message is sent by the client when the command
       is either suspended or resumed.  It contains the following
       members:

       delay   The elapsed time since the last record in the form of a
               <i>TimeSpec</i>.  The <i>delay</i> should be calculated using a
               monotonic clock where possible.

       signal  The signal name without the leading “SIG”.  For example,
               STOP, TSTP, CONT.
</pre> <h2>
Server Messages </h2>
<pre>
       A <i>ServerMessage</i> is a container used to encapsulate all the
       possible message types the server may send to a client.

       message ServerMessage {
         oneof type {
           ServerHello hello = 1;
           TimeSpec commit_point = 2;
           string log_id = 3;
           string error = 4;
           string abort = 5;
         }
       }

       The different <i>ServerMessage</i> sub-messages the server may sent to
       the client are described below.

   <b>ServerHello hello</b>
       message ServerHello {
         string server_id = 1;
         string redirect = 2;
         repeated string servers = 3;
         bool subcommands = 4;
       }

       The <i>ServerHello</i> message consists of server information sent when
       the client first connects.  It contains the following members:

       server_id
               A free-form server description.  Usually this includes
               the name and version of the implementation running on the
               log server.  This member is always present.

       redirect
               A host and port separated by a colon (‘’): that the
               client should connect to instead.  The host may be a host
               name, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address in square
               brackets.  This may be used for server load balancing.
               The server will disconnect after sending the <i>ServerHello</i>
               when it includes a <b>redirect</b>.

       servers
               A list of other known log servers.  This can be used to
               implement log server redundancy and allows the client to
               discover all other log servers simply by connecting to
               one known server.  This member may be omitted when there
               is only a single log server.

       subcommands
               If set, the server supports logging additional commands
               during a session.  The client may send an <i>AcceptMessage</i>
               or <i>RejectMessage</i> when <b>sudo </b>is running in <i>intercept</i> mode.
               In this mode, commands spawned from the initial command
               authorized by <b>sudo </b>are subject to policy restrictions
               and/or are logged.  If <i>subcommands</i> is false, the client
               must not attempt to log additional commands.

   <b>TimeSpec commit_point</b>
       A periodic time stamp sent by the server to indicate when I/O log
       buffers have been committed to storage.  This message is not sent
       after every <i>IoBuffer</i> but rather at a server-configurable
       interval.  When the server receives an <i>ExitMessage</i>, it will
       respond with a <i>commit_point</i> corresponding to the last received
       <i>IoBuffer</i> before closing the connection.

   <b>string log_id</b>
       The server-side ID of the I/O log being stored, sent in response
       to an <i>AcceptMessage</i> where <i>expect_iobufs</i> is true.

   <b>string error</b>
       A fatal server-side error.  The server will close the connection
       after sending the <i>error</i> message.

   <b>string abort</b>
       An <i>abort</i> message from the server indicates that the client should
       kill the command and terminate the session.  It may be used to
       implement simple server-side policy.  The server will close the
       connection after sending the <i>abort</i> message.
</pre> <h2>
Protocol flow of control </h2>
<pre>
       The expected protocol flow is as follows:

       1.   Client connects to the first available server.  If the
            client is configured to use TLS, a TLS handshake will be
            attempted.

       2.   Client sends <i>ClientHello</i>.  This is currently optional but
            allows the server to detect a non-TLS connection on the TLS
            port.

       3.   Server sends <i>ServerHello</i>.

       4.   Client responds with either <i>AcceptMessage</i>, <i>RejectMessage</i>, or
            <i>RestartMessage</i>.

       5.   If client sent a <i>AcceptMessage</i> with <i>expect_iobufs</i> set,
            server creates a new I/O log and responds with a <i>log_id</i>.

       6.   Client sends zero or more <i>IoBuffer</i> messages.

       7.   Server periodically responds to <i>IoBuffer</i> messages with a
            <i>commit_point</i>.

       8.   Client sends an <i>ExitMessage</i> when the command exits or is
            killed.

       9.   Server sends the final <i>commit_point</i> if one is pending.

       10.  Server closes the connection.  After receiving the final
            <i>commit_point</i>, the client shuts down its side of the TLS
            connection if TLS is in use, and closes the connection.

       11.  Server shuts down its side of the TLS connection if TLS is
            in use, and closes the connection.

       At any point, the server may send an <i>error</i> or <i>abort</i> message to
       the client at which point the server will close the connection.
       If an <i>abort</i> message is received, the client should terminate the
       running command.
</pre> <h2>
EVENT LOG VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>AcceptMessage</i>, <i>AlertMessage</i> and <i>RejectMessage</i> classes contain an
       array of <i>InfoMessage</i> that should contain information about the
       user who submitted the command as well as information about the
       execution environment of the command if it was accepted.

       Some variables have a <i>client</i>, <i>run</i>, or <i>submit</i> prefix.  These
       prefixes are used to eliminate ambiguity for variables that could
       apply to the client program, the user submitting the command, or
       the command being run.  Variables with a <i>client</i> prefix pertain to
       the program performing the connection to the log server, for
       example <b>sudo</b>.  Variables with a <i>run</i> prefix pertain to the command
       that the user requested be run.  Variables with a <i>submit</i> prefix
       pertain to the user submitting the request (the user running
       <b>sudo</b>).

       The following <i>InfoMessage</i> entries are required:

       <b>Key            Type          Description</b>
       command        string        command that was submitted

                                                                                 on
       submituser     string        name of user submitting the command
