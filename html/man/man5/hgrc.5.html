NAME </h2>
<pre>
       hgrc - configuration files for Mercurial
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control
       aspects of its behavior.
</pre> <h2>
TROUBLESHOOTING </h2>
<pre>
       If you're having problems with your configuration, <b>hg config</b>
       <b>--source </b>can help you understand what is introducing a setting
       into your environment.

       See <b>hg help config.syntax </b>and <b>hg help config.files </b>for
       information about how and where to override things.
</pre> <h2>
STRUCTURE </h2>
<pre>
       The configuration files use a simple ini-file format. A
       configuration file consists of sections, led by a <b>[section]</b>
       header and followed by <b>name = value </b>entries:

       [ui]
       username = Firstname Lastname &lt;firstname.lastname@example.net&gt;
       verbose = True

       The above entries will be referred to as <b>ui.username </b>and
       <b>ui.verbose</b>, respectively. See <b>hg help config.syntax</b>.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial reads configuration data from several files, if they
       exist.  These files do not exist by default and you will have to
       create the appropriate configuration files yourself:

       Local configuration is put into the per-repository
       <b>&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc </b>file.

       Global configuration like the username setting is typically put
       into:

       • <b>%USERPROFILE%\mercurial.ini </b>(on Windows)

       • <b>$HOME/.hgrc </b>(on Unix, Plan9)

       The names of these files depend on the system on which Mercurial
       is installed. <b>*.rc </b>files from a single directory are read in
       alphabetical order, later ones overriding earlier ones. Where
       multiple paths are given below, settings from earlier paths
       override later ones.

       On Unix, the following files are consulted:

       • <b>&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc-not-shared </b>(per-repository)

       • <b>&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc </b>(per-repository)

       • <b>$HOME/.hgrc </b>(per-user)

       • <b>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/hg/hgrc </b>(per-user)

       • <b>&lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc </b>(per-installation)

       • <b>&lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc </b>(per-installation)

       • <b>/etc/mercurial/hgrc </b>(per-system)

       • <b>/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc </b>(per-system)

       • <b>&lt;internal&gt;/*.rc </b>(defaults)

       On Windows, the following files are consulted:

       • <b>&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc-not-shared </b>(per-repository)

       • <b>&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc </b>(per-repository)

       • <b>%USERPROFILE%\.hgrc </b>(per-user)

       • <b>%USERPROFILE%\Mercurial.ini </b>(per-user)

       • <b>%HOME%\.hgrc </b>(per-user)

       • <b>%HOME%\Mercurial.ini </b>(per-user)

       • <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mercurial </b>(per-system)

       • <b>&lt;install-dir&gt;\hgrc.d\*.rc </b>(per-installation)

       • <b>&lt;install-dir&gt;\Mercurial.ini </b>(per-installation)

       • <b>%PROGRAMDATA%\Mercurial\hgrc </b>(per-system)

       • <b>%PROGRAMDATA%\Mercurial\Mercurial.ini </b>(per-system)

       • <b>%PROGRAMDATA%\Mercurial\hgrc.d\*.rc </b>(per-system)

       • <b>&lt;internal&gt;/*.rc </b>(defaults)

       Note   The registry key
              <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Mercurial </b>is used
              when running 32-bit Python on 64-bit Windows.

       On Plan9, the following files are consulted:

       • <b>&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc-not-shared </b>(per-repository)

       • <b>&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc </b>(per-repository)

       • <b>$home/lib/hgrc </b>(per-user)

       • <b>&lt;install-root&gt;/lib/mercurial/hgrc </b>(per-installation)

       • <b>&lt;install-root&gt;/lib/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc </b>(per-installation)

       • <b>/lib/mercurial/hgrc </b>(per-system)

       • <b>/lib/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc </b>(per-system)

       • <b>&lt;internal&gt;/*.rc </b>(defaults)

       Per-repository configuration options only apply in a particular
       repository. This file is not version-controlled, and will not get
       transferred during a "clone" operation. Options in this file
       override options in all other configuration files.

       On Plan 9 and Unix, most of this file will be ignored if it
       doesn't belong to a trusted user or to a trusted group. See <b>hg</b>
       <b>help config.trusted </b>for more details.

       Per-user configuration file(s) are for the user running
       Mercurial.  Options in these files apply to all Mercurial
       commands executed by this user in any directory. Options in these
       files override per-system and per-installation options.

       Per-installation configuration files are searched for in the
       directory where Mercurial is installed. <b>&lt;install-root&gt; </b>is the
       parent directory of the <b>hg </b>executable (or symlink) being run.

       For example, if installed in <b>/shared/tools/bin/hg</b>, Mercurial will
       look in <b>/shared/tools/etc/mercurial/hgrc</b>. Options in these files
       apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any
       directory.

       Per-installation configuration files are for the system on which
       Mercurial is running. Options in these files apply to all
       Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory.
       Registry keys contain PATH-like strings, every part of which must
       reference a <b>Mercurial.ini </b>file or be a directory where <b>*.rc </b>files
       will be read.  Mercurial checks each of these locations in the
       specified order until one or more configuration files are
       detected.

       Per-system configuration files are for the system on which
       Mercurial is running. Options in these files apply to all
       Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory. Options
       in these files override per-installation options.

       Mercurial comes with some default configuration. The default
       configuration files are installed with Mercurial and will be
       overwritten on upgrades. Default configuration files should never
       be edited by users or administrators but can be overridden in
       other configuration files. So far the directory only contains
       merge tool configuration but packagers can also put other default
       configuration there.

       On versions 5.7 and later, if share-safe functionality is
       enabled, shares will read config file of share source too.
       <i>&lt;share-source/.hg/hgrc&gt;</i> is read before reading <i>&lt;repo/.hg/hgrc&gt;</i>.

       For configs which should not be shared,
       <i>&lt;repo/.hg/hgrc-not-shared&gt;</i> should be used.
</pre> <h2>
SYNTAX </h2>
<pre>
       A configuration file consists of sections, led by a <b>[section]</b>
       header and followed by <b>name = value </b>entries (sometimes called
       <b>configuration keys</b>):

       [spam]
       eggs=ham
       green=
          eggs

       Each line contains one entry. If the lines that follow are
       indented, they are treated as continuations of that entry.
       Leading whitespace is removed from values. Empty lines are
       skipped. Lines beginning with <b># </b>or <b>; </b>are ignored and may be used
       to provide comments.

       Configuration keys can be set multiple times, in which case
       Mercurial will use the value that was configured last. As an
       example:

       [spam]
       eggs=large
       ham=serrano
       eggs=small

       This would set the configuration key named <b>eggs </b>to <b>small</b>.

       It is also possible to define a section multiple times. A section
       can be redefined on the same and/or on different configuration
       files. For example:

       [foo]
       eggs=large
       ham=serrano
       eggs=small

       [bar]
       eggs=ham
       green=
          eggs

       [foo]
       ham=prosciutto
       eggs=medium
       bread=toasted

       This would set the <b>eggs</b>, <b>ham</b>, and <b>bread </b>configuration keys of the
       <b>foo </b>section to <b>medium</b>, <b>prosciutto</b>, and <b>toasted</b>, respectively. As
       you can see there only thing that matters is the last value that
       was set for each of the configuration keys.

       If a configuration key is set multiple times in different
       configuration files the final value will depend on the order in
       which the different configuration files are read, with settings
       from earlier paths overriding later ones as described on the
       <b>Files </b>section above.

       A line of the form <b>%include file </b>will include <b>file </b>into the
       current configuration file. The inclusion is recursive, which
       means that included files can include other files. Filenames are
       relative to the configuration file in which the <b>%include</b>
       directive is found.  Environment variables and <b>~user </b>constructs
       are expanded in <b>file</b>. This lets you do something like:

       %include ~/.hgrc.d/$HOST.rc

       to include a different configuration file on each computer you
       use.

       A line with <b>%unset name </b>will remove <b>name </b>from the current
       section, if it has been set previously.

       The values are either free-form text strings, lists of text
       strings, or Boolean values. Boolean values can be set to true
       using any of "1", "yes", "true", or "on" and to false using "0",
       "no", "false", or "off" (all case insensitive).

       List values are separated by whitespace or comma, except when
       values are placed in double quotation marks:

       allow_read = "John Doe, PhD", brian, betty

       Quotation marks can be escaped by prefixing them with a
       backslash. Only quotation marks at the beginning of a word is
       counted as a quotation (e.g., <b>foo"bar baz </b>is the list of <b>foo"bar</b>
       and <b>baz</b>).
</pre> <h2>
SECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       This section describes the different sections that may appear in
       a Mercurial configuration file, the purpose of each section, its
       possible keys, and their possible values.

   <b>alias</b>
       Defines command aliases.

       Aliases allow you to define your own commands in terms of other
       commands (or aliases), optionally including arguments. Positional
       arguments in the form of <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b>, etc. in the alias definition are
       expanded by Mercurial before execution. Positional arguments not
       already used by <b>$N </b>in the definition are put at the end of the
       command to be executed.

       Alias definitions consist of lines of the form:

       &lt;alias&gt; = &lt;command&gt; [&lt;argument&gt;]...

       For example, this definition:

       latest = log --limit 5

       creates a new command <b>latest </b>that shows only the five most recent
       changesets. You can define subsequent aliases using earlier ones:

       stable5 = latest -b stable

       Note   It is possible to create aliases with the same names as
              existing commands, which will then override the original
              definitions. This is almost always a bad idea!

       An alias can start with an exclamation point (<b>!</b>) to make it a
       shell alias. A shell alias is executed with the shell and will
       let you run arbitrary commands. As an example,

       echo = !echo $@

       will let you do <b>hg echo foo </b>to have <b>foo </b>printed in your terminal.
       A better example might be:

       purge = !$HG status --no-status --unknown -0 re: | xargs -0 rm -f

       which will make <b>hg purge </b>delete all unknown files in the
       repository in the same manner as the purge extension.

       Positional arguments like <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b>, etc. in the alias definition
       expand to the command arguments. Unmatched arguments are removed.
       <b>$0 </b>expands to the alias name and <b>$@ </b>expands to all arguments
       separated by a space. <b>"$@" </b>(with quotes) expands to all arguments
       quoted individually and separated by a space. These expansions
       happen before the command is passed to the shell.

       Shell aliases are executed in an environment where <b>$HG </b>expands to
       the path of the Mercurial that was used to execute the alias.
       This is useful when you want to call further Mercurial commands
       in a shell alias, as was done above for the purge alias. In
       addition, <b>$HG_ARGS </b>expands to the arguments given to Mercurial.
       In the <b>hg echo foo </b>call above, <b>$HG_ARGS </b>would expand to <b>echo foo</b>.

       Note   Some global configuration options such as <b>-R </b>are processed
              before shell aliases and will thus not be passed to
              aliases.

   <b>annotate</b>
       Settings used when displaying file annotations. All values are
       Booleans and default to False. See <b>hg help config.diff </b>for
       related options for the diff command.

       <b>ignorews</b>

              Ignore white space when comparing lines.

       <b>ignorewseol</b>

              Ignore white space at the end of a line when comparing
              lines.

       <b>ignorewsamount</b>

              Ignore changes in the amount of white space.

       <b>ignoreblanklines</b>

              Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.

   <b>auth</b>
       Authentication credentials and other authentication-like
       configuration for HTTP connections. This section allows you to
       store usernames and passwords for use when logging <i>into</i> HTTP
       servers. See <b>hg help config.web </b>if you want to configure <i>who</i> can
       login to your HTTP server.

       The following options apply to all hosts.

       <b>cookiefile</b>

              Path to a file containing HTTP cookie lines. Cookies
              matching a host will be sent automatically.

              The file format uses the Mozilla cookies.txt format, which
              defines cookies on their own lines. Each line contains 7
              fields delimited by the tab character (domain,
              is_domain_cookie, path, is_secure, expires, name, value).
              For more info, do an Internet search for "Netscape
              cookies.txt format."

              Note: the cookies parser does not handle port numbers on
              domains. You will need to remove ports from the domain for
              the cookie to be recognized.  This could result in a
              cookie being disclosed to an unwanted server.

              The cookies file is read-only.

       Other options in this section are grouped by name and have the
       following format:

       &lt;name&gt;.&lt;argument&gt; = &lt;value&gt;

       where <b>&lt;name&gt; </b>is used to group arguments into authentication
       entries. Example:

       foo.prefix = hg.intevation.de/mercurial
       foo.username = foo
       foo.password = bar
       foo.schemes = http https

       bar.prefix = secure.example.org
       bar.key = path/to/file.key
       bar.cert = path/to/file.cert
       bar.schemes = https

       Supported arguments:

       <b>prefix</b>

              Either <b>* </b>or a URI prefix with or without the scheme part.
              The authentication entry with the longest matching prefix
              is used (where <b>* </b>matches everything and counts as a match
              of length 1). If the prefix doesn't include a scheme, the
              match is performed against the URI with its scheme
              stripped as well, and the schemes argument, q.v., is then
              subsequently consulted.

       <b>username</b>

              Optional. Username to authenticate with. If not given, and
              the remote site requires basic or digest authentication,
              the user will be prompted for it. Environment variables
              are expanded in the username letting you do <b>foo.username =</b>
              <b>$USER</b>. If the URI includes a username, only <b>[auth] </b>entries
              with a matching username or without a username will be
              considered.

       <b>password</b>

              Optional. Password to authenticate with. If not given, and
              the remote site requires basic or digest authentication,
              the user will be prompted for it.

       <b>key</b>

              Optional. PEM encoded client certificate key file.
              Environment variables are expanded in the filename.

       <b>cert</b>

              Optional. PEM encoded client certificate chain file.
              Environment variables are expanded in the filename.

       <b>schemes</b>

              Optional. Space separated list of URI schemes to use this
              authentication entry with. Only used if the prefix doesn't
              include a scheme. Supported schemes are http and https.
              They will match static-http and static-https respectively,
              as well.  (default: https)

       If no suitable authentication entry is found, the user is
       prompted for credentials as usual if required by the remote.

   <b>cmdserver</b>
       Controls command server settings. (ADVANCED)

       <b>message-encodings</b>

              List of encodings for the <b>m </b>(message) channel. The first
              encoding supported by the server will be selected and
              advertised in the hello message. This is useful only when
              <b>ui.message-output </b>is set to <b>channel</b>. Supported encodings
              are <b>cbor</b>.

       <b>shutdown-on-interrupt</b>

              If set to false, the server's main loop will continue
              running after SIGINT received. <b>runcommand </b>requests can
              still be interrupted by SIGINT. Close the write end of the
              pipe to shut down the server process gracefully.
              (default: True)

   <b>color</b>
       Configure the Mercurial color mode. For details about how to
       define your custom effect and style see <b>hg help color</b>.

       <b>mode</b>

              String: control the method used to output color. One of
              <b>auto</b>, <b>ansi</b>, <b>win32</b>, <b>terminfo </b>or <b>debug</b>. In auto mode,
              Mercurial will use ANSI mode by default (or win32 mode
              prior to Windows 10) if it detects a terminal. Any invalid
              value will disable color.

       <b>pagermode</b>

              String: optional override of <b>color.mode </b>used with pager.

              On some systems, terminfo mode may cause problems when
              using color with <b>less -R </b>as a pager program. less with the
              -R option will only display ECMA-48 color codes, and
              terminfo mode may sometimes emit codes that less doesn't
              understand. You can work around this by either using ansi
              mode (or auto mode), or by using less -r (which will pass
              through all terminal control codes, not just color control
              codes).

              On some systems (such as MSYS in Windows), the terminal
              may support a different color mode than the pager program.

   <b>commands</b>
       <b>commit.post-status</b>

              Show status of files in the working directory after
              successful commit.  (default: False)

       <b>merge.require-rev</b>

              Require that the revision to merge the current commit with
              be specified on the command line. If this is enabled and a
              revision is not specified, the command aborts.  (default:
              False)

       <b>push.require-revs</b>

              Require revisions to push be specified using one or more
              mechanisms such as specifying them positionally on the
              command line, using <b>-r</b>, <b>-b</b>, and/or <b>-B </b>on the command line,
              or using <b>paths.&lt;path&gt;:pushrev </b>in the configuration. If
              this is enabled and revisions are not specified, the
              command aborts.  (default: False)

       <b>resolve.confirm</b>

              Confirm before performing action if no filename is passed.
              (default: False)

       <b>resolve.explicit-re-merge</b>

              Require uses of <b>hg resolve </b>to specify which action it
              should perform, instead of re-merging files by default.
              (default: False)

       <b>resolve.mark-check</b>

              Determines what level of checking <b>hg resolve --mark </b>will
              perform before marking files as resolved. Valid values are
              <b>none`, ``warn</b>, and <b>abort</b>. <b>warn </b>will output a warning
              listing the file(s) that still have conflict markers in
              them, but will still mark everything resolved.  <b>abort </b>will
              output the same warning but will not mark things as
              resolved.  If --all is passed and this is set to <b>abort</b>,
              only a warning will be shown (an error will not be
              raised).  (default: <b>none</b>)

       <b>status.relative</b>

              Make paths in <b>hg status </b>output relative to the current
              directory.  (default: False)

       <b>status.terse</b>

              Default value for the --terse flag, which condenses status
              output.  (default: empty)

       <b>update.check</b>

              Determines what level of checking <b>hg update </b>will perform
              before moving to a destination revision. Valid values are
              <b>abort</b>, <b>none</b>, <b>linear</b>, and <b>noconflict</b>.

              • <b>abort </b>always fails if the working directory has
                uncommitted changes.

              • <b>none </b>performs no checking, and may result in a merge
                with uncommitted changes.

              • <b>linear </b>allows any update as long as it follows a
                straight line in the revision history, and may trigger a
                merge with uncommitted changes.

              • <b>noconflict </b>will allow any update which would not trigger
                a merge with uncommitted changes, if any are present.

              (default: <b>linear</b>)

       <b>update.requiredest</b>

              Require that the user pass a destination when running <b>hg</b>
              <b>update</b>.  For example, <b>hg update .:: </b>will be allowed, but a
              plain <b>hg update </b>will be disallowed.  (default: False)

   <b>committemplate</b>
       <b>changeset</b>

              String: configuration in this section is used as the
              template to customize the text shown in the editor when
              committing.

       In addition to pre-defined template keywords, commit log specific
       one below can be used for customization:

       <b>extramsg</b>

              String: Extra message (typically 'Leave message empty to
              abort commit.'). This may be changed by some commands or
              extensions.

       For example, the template configuration below shows as same text
       as one shown by default:

       [committemplate]
       changeset = {desc}\n\n
           HG: Enter commit message.  Lines beginning with 'HG:' are removed.
           HG: {extramsg}
           HG: --
           HG: user: {author}\n{ifeq(p2rev, "-1", "",
          "HG: branch merge\n")
          }HG: branch '{branch}'\n{if(activebookmark,
          "HG: bookmark '{activebookmark}'\n")   }{subrepos %
          "HG: subrepo {subrepo}\n"              }{file_adds %
          "HG: added {file}\n"                   }{file_mods %
          "HG: changed {file}\n"                 }{file_dels %
          "HG: removed {file}\n"                 }{if(files, "",
          "HG: no files changed\n")}

       <b>diff()</b>

              String: show the diff (see <b>hg help templates </b>for detail)

       Sometimes it is helpful to show the diff of the changeset in the
       editor without having to prefix 'HG: ' to each line so that
       highlighting works correctly. For this, Mercurial provides a
       special string which will ignore everything below it:

       HG: ------------------------ &gt;8 ------------------------

       For example, the template configuration below will show the diff
       below the extra message:

       [committemplate]
       changeset = {desc}\n\n
           HG: Enter commit message.  Lines beginning with 'HG:' are removed.
           HG: {extramsg}
           HG: ------------------------ &gt;8 ------------------------
           HG: Do not touch the line above.
           HG: Everything below will be removed.
           {diff()}

       Note   For some problematic encodings (see <b>hg help win32mbcs </b>for
              detail), this customization should be configured
              carefully, to avoid showing broken characters.

              For example, if a multibyte character ending with
              backslash (0x5c) is followed by the ASCII character 'n' in
              the customized template, the sequence of backslash and 'n'
              is treated as line-feed unexpectedly (and the multibyte
              character is broken, too).

       Customized template is used for commands below (<b>--edit </b>may be
       required):

       • <b>hg backout</b>

       • <b>hg commit</b>

       • <b>hg fetch </b>(for merge commit only)

       • <b>hg graft</b>

       • <b>hg histedit</b>

       • <b>hg import</b>

       • <b>hg qfold</b>, <b>hg qnew </b>and <b>hg qrefresh</b>

       • <b>hg rebase</b>

       • <b>hg shelve</b>

       • <b>hg sign</b>

       • <b>hg tag</b>

       • <b>hg transplant</b>

       Configuring items below instead of <b>changeset </b>allows showing
       customized message only for specific actions, or showing
       different messages for each action.

       • <b>changeset.backout </b>for <b>hg backout</b>

       • <b>changeset.commit.amend.merge </b>for <b>hg commit --amend </b>on merges

       • <b>changeset.commit.amend.normal </b>for <b>hg commit --amend </b>on other

       • <b>changeset.commit.normal.merge </b>for <b>hg commit </b>on merges

       • <b>changeset.commit.normal.normal </b>for <b>hg commit </b>on other

       • <b>changeset.fetch </b>for <b>hg fetch </b>(impling merge commit)

       • <b>changeset.gpg.sign </b>for <b>hg sign</b>

       • <b>changeset.graft </b>for <b>hg graft</b>

       • <b>changeset.histedit.edit </b>for <b>edit </b>of <b>hg histedit</b>

       • <b>changeset.histedit.fold </b>for <b>fold </b>of <b>hg histedit</b>

       • <b>changeset.histedit.mess </b>for <b>mess </b>of <b>hg histedit</b>

       • <b>changeset.histedit.pick </b>for <b>pick </b>of <b>hg histedit</b>

       • <b>changeset.import.bypass </b>for <b>hg import --bypass</b>

       • <b>changeset.import.normal.merge </b>for <b>hg import </b>on merges

       • <b>changeset.import.normal.normal </b>for <b>hg import </b>on other

       • <b>changeset.mq.qnew </b>for <b>hg qnew</b>

       • <b>changeset.mq.qfold </b>for <b>hg qfold</b>

       • <b>changeset.mq.qrefresh </b>for <b>hg qrefresh</b>

       • <b>changeset.rebase.collapse </b>for <b>hg rebase --collapse</b>

       • <b>changeset.rebase.merge </b>for <b>hg rebase </b>on merges

       • <b>changeset.rebase.normal </b>for <b>hg rebase </b>on other

       • <b>changeset.shelve.shelve </b>for <b>hg shelve</b>

       • <b>changeset.tag.add </b>for <b>hg tag </b>without <b>--remove</b>

       • <b>changeset.tag.remove </b>for <b>hg tag --remove</b>

       • <b>changeset.transplant.merge </b>for <b>hg transplant </b>on merges

       • <b>changeset.transplant.normal </b>for <b>hg transplant </b>on other

       These dot-separated lists of names are treated as hierarchical
       ones.  For example, <b>changeset.tag.remove </b>customizes the commit
       message only for <b>hg tag --remove</b>, but <b>changeset.tag </b>customizes
       the commit message for <b>hg tag </b>regardless of <b>--remove </b>option.

       When the external editor is invoked for a commit, the
       corresponding dot-separated list of names without the <b>changeset.</b>
       prefix (e.g. <b>commit.normal.normal</b>) is in the <b>HGEDITFORM</b>
       environment variable.

       In this section, items other than <b>changeset </b>can be referred from
       others. For example, the configuration to list committed files up
       below can be referred as <b>{listupfiles}</b>:

       [committemplate]
       listupfiles = {file_adds %
          "HG: added {file}\n"     }{file_mods %
          "HG: changed {file}\n"   }{file_dels %
          "HG: removed {file}\n"   }{if(files, "",
          "HG: no files changed\n")}

   <b>decode/encode</b>
       Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin. This would
       typically be used for newline processing or other
       localization/canonicalization of files.

       Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command.
       Filter patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository
       root.  For example, to match any file ending in <b>.txt </b>in the root
       directory only, use the pattern <b>*.txt</b>. To match any file ending
       in <b>.c </b>anywhere in the repository, use the pattern <b>**.c</b>.  For each
       file only the first matching filter applies.

       The filter command can start with a specifier, either <b>pipe: </b>or
       <b>tempfile:</b>. If no specifier is given, <b>pipe: </b>is used by default.

       A <b>pipe: </b>command must accept data on stdin and return the
       transformed data on stdout.

       Pipe example:

       [encode]
       # uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
       # note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
       *.gz = pipe: gunzip

       [decode]
       # recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir (we
       # can safely omit "pipe:", because it's the default)
       *.gz = gzip

       A <b>tempfile: </b>command is a template. The string <b>INFILE </b>is replaced
       with the name of a temporary file that contains the data to be
       filtered by the command. The string <b>OUTFILE </b>is replaced with the
       name of an empty temporary file, where the filtered data must be
       written by the command.

       Note   The tempfile mechanism is recommended for Windows systems,
              where the standard shell I/O redirection operators often
              have strange effects and may corrupt the contents of your
              files.

       This filter mechanism is used internally by the <b>eol </b>extension to
       translate line ending characters between Windows (CRLF) and Unix
       (LF) format. We suggest you use the <b>eol </b>extension for
       convenience.

   <b>defaults</b>
       (defaults are deprecated. Don't use them. Use aliases instead.)

       Use the <b>[defaults] </b>section to define command defaults, i.e. the
       default options/arguments to pass to the specified commands.

       The following example makes <b>hg log </b>run in verbose mode, and <b>hg</b>
       <b>status </b>show only the modified files, by default:

       [defaults]
       log = -v
       status = -m

       The actual commands, instead of their aliases, must be used when
       defining command defaults. The command defaults will also be
       applied to the aliases of the commands defined.

   <b>diff</b>
       Settings used when displaying diffs. Everything except for
       <b>unified </b>is a Boolean and defaults to False. See <b>hg help</b>
       <b>config.annotate </b>for related options for the annotate command.

       <b>git</b>

              Use git extended diff format.

       <b>nobinary</b>

              Omit git binary patches.

       <b>nodates</b>

              Don't include dates in diff headers.

       <b>noprefix</b>

              Omit 'a/' and 'b/' prefixes from filenames. Ignored in
              plain mode.

       <b>showfunc</b>

              Show which function each change is in.

       <b>ignorews</b>

              Ignore white space when comparing lines.

       <b>ignorewsamount</b>

              Ignore changes in the amount of white space.

       <b>ignoreblanklines</b>

              Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.

       <b>unified</b>

              Number of lines of context to show.

       <b>word-diff</b>

              Highlight changed words.

   <b>email</b>
       Settings for extensions that send email messages.

       <b>from</b>

              Optional. Email address to use in "From" header and SMTP
              envelope of outgoing messages.

       <b>to</b>

              Optional. Comma-separated list of recipients' email
              addresses.

       <b>cc</b>

              Optional. Comma-separated list of carbon copy recipients'
              email addresses.

       <b>bcc</b>

              Optional. Comma-separated list of blind carbon copy
              recipients' email addresses.

       <b>method</b>

              Optional. Method to use to send email messages. If value
              is <b>smtp </b>(default), use SMTP (see the <b>[smtp] </b>section for
              configuration).  Otherwise, use as name of program to run
              that acts like sendmail (takes <b>-f </b>option for sender, list
              of recipients on command line, message on stdin).
              Normally, setting this to <b>sendmail </b>or <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b>
              is enough to use sendmail to send messages.

       <b>charsets</b>

              Optional. Comma-separated list of character sets
              considered convenient for recipients. Addresses, headers,
              and parts not containing patches of outgoing messages will
              be encoded in the first character set to which conversion
              from local encoding (<b>$HGENCODING</b>, <b>ui.fallbackencoding</b>)
              succeeds. If correct conversion fails, the text in
              question is sent as is.  (default: '')

              Order of outgoing email character sets:

              1. <b>us-ascii</b>: always first, regardless of settings

              2. <b>email.charsets</b>: in order given by user

              3. <b>ui.fallbackencoding</b>: if not in email.charsets

              4. <b>$HGENCODING</b>: if not in email.charsets

              5. <b>utf-8</b>: always last, regardless of settings

       Email example:

       [email]
       from = Joseph User &lt;joe.user@example.com&gt;
       method = /usr/sbin/sendmail
       # charsets for western Europeans
       # us-ascii, utf-8 omitted, as they are tried first and last
       charsets = iso-8859-1, iso-8859-15, windows-1252

   <b>extensions</b>
       Mercurial has an extension mechanism for adding new features. To
       enable an extension, create an entry for it in this section.

       If you know that the extension is already in Python's search
       path, you can give the name of the module, followed by <b>=</b>, with
       nothing after the <b>=</b>.

       Otherwise, give a name that you choose, followed by <b>=</b>, followed
       by the path to the <b>.py </b>file (including the file name extension)
       that defines the extension.

       To explicitly disable an extension that is enabled in an hgrc of
       broader scope, prepend its path with <b>!</b>, as in <b>foo = !/ext/path </b>or
       <b>foo = ! </b>when path is not supplied.

       Example for <b>~/.hgrc</b>:

       [extensions]
       # (the churn extension will get loaded from Mercurial's path)
       churn =
       # (this extension will get loaded from the file specified)
       myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py

       If an extension fails to load, a warning will be issued, and
       Mercurial will proceed. To enforce that an extension must be
       loaded, one can set the <i>required</i> suboption in the config:

       [extensions]
       myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py
       myfeature:required = yes

       To debug extension loading issue, one can add <i>--traceback</i> to
       their mercurial invocation.

       A default setting can we set using the special <i>*</i> extension key:

       [extensions]
       *:required = yes
       myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py
       rebase=

   <b>format</b>
       Configuration that controls the repository format. Newer format
       options are more powerful, but incompatible with some older
       versions of Mercurial. Format options are considered at
       repository initialization only. You need to make a new clone for
       config changes to be taken into account.

       For more details about repository format and version
       compatibility, see
       <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/MissingRequirement">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/MissingRequirement</a>

       <b>usegeneraldelta</b>

              Enable or disable the "generaldelta" repository format
              which improves repository compression by allowing "revlog"
              to store deltas against arbitrary revisions instead of the
              previously stored one. This provides significant
              improvement for repositories with branches.

              Repositories with this on-disk format require Mercurial
              version 1.9.

              Enabled by default.

       <b>dotencode</b>

              Enable or disable the "dotencode" repository format which
              enhances the "fncache" repository format (which has to be
              enabled to use dotencode) to avoid issues with filenames
              starting with "._" on Mac OS X and spaces on Windows.

              Repositories with this on-disk format require Mercurial
              version 1.7.

              Enabled by default.

       <b>usefncache</b>

              Enable or disable the "fncache" repository format which
              enhances the "store" repository format (which has to be
              enabled to use fncache) to allow longer filenames and
              avoids using Windows reserved names, e.g. "nul".

              Repositories with this on-disk format require Mercurial
              version 1.1.

              Enabled by default.

       <b>use-dirstate-v2</b>

              Enable or disable the experimental "dirstate-v2" feature.
              The dirstate functionality is shared by all commands
              interacting with the working copy.  The new version is
              more robust, faster and stores more information.

              The performance-improving version of this feature is
              currently only implemented in Rust (see <b>hg help rust</b>), so
              people not using a version of Mercurial compiled with the
              Rust parts might actually suffer some slowdown.  For this
              reason, such versions will by default refuse to access
              repositories with "dirstate-v2" enabled.

              This behavior can be adjusted via configuration: check <b>hg</b>
              <b>help config.storage.dirstate-v2.slow-path </b>for details.

              Repositories with this on-disk format require Mercurial
              6.0 or above.

              By default this format variant is disabled if the fast
              implementation is not available, and enabled by default if
              the fast implementation is available.

              To accomodate installations of Mercurial without the fast
              implementation, you can downgrade your repository. To do
              so run the following command:

              <b>$ hg debugupgraderepo</b>
                     --run --config format.use-dirstate-v2=False
                     --config storage.dirstate-v2.slow-path=allow

              For a more comprehensive guide, see <b>hg help</b>
              <b>internals.dirstate-v2</b>.

       <b>use-dirstate-v2.automatic-upgrade-of-mismatching-repositories</b>

              When enabled, an automatic upgrade will be triggered when
              a repository format does not match its <i>use-dirstate-v2</i>
              config.

              This is an advanced behavior that most users will not
              need. We recommend you don't use this unless you are a
              seasoned administrator of a Mercurial install base.

              Automatic upgrade means that any process accessing the
              repository will upgrade the repository format to use
              <i>dirstate-v2</i>. This only triggers if a change is needed.
              This also applies to operations that would have been
              read-only (like hg status).

              If the repository cannot be locked, the automatic-upgrade
              operation will be skipped. The next operation will attempt
              it again.

              This configuration will apply for moves in any direction,
              either adding the <i>dirstate-v2</i> format if
              <i>format.use-dirstate-v2=yes</i> or removing the <i>dirstate-v2</i>
              requirement if <i>format.use-dirstate-v2=no</i>. So we recommend
              setting both this value and <i>format.use-dirstate-v2</i> at the
              same time.

       <b>use-dirstate-tracked-hint</b>

              Enable or disable the writing of "tracked key" file
              alongside the dirstate.  (default to disabled)

              That "tracked-hint" can help external automations to
              detect changes to the set of tracked files. (i.e the
              result of <i>hg files</i> or <i>hg status -macd</i>)

              The tracked-hint is written in a new
              <i>.hg/dirstate-tracked-hint</i>. That file contains two lines: -
              the first line is the file version (currently: 1), - the
              second line contains the "tracked-hint".  That file is
              written right after the dirstate is written.

              The tracked-hint changes whenever the set of file tracked
              in the dirstate changes. The general idea is: - if the
              hint is identical, the set of tracked file SHOULD be
              identical, - if the hint is different, the set of tracked
              file MIGHT be different.

              The "hint is identical" case uses <i>SHOULD</i> as the dirstate
              and the hint file are two distinct files and therefore
              that cannot be read or written to in an atomic way. If the
              key is identical, nothing garantees that the dirstate is
              not updated right after the hint file. This is considered
              a negligible limitation for the intended usecase. It is
              actually possible to prevent this race by taking the
              repository lock during read operations.

              They are two "ways" to use this feature:

              1) monitoring changes to the <i>.hg/dirstate-tracked-hint</i>, if
              the file changes, the tracked set might have changed.

              2. storing the value and comparing it to a later value.

       <b>use-dirstate-tracked-hint.automatic-upgrade-of-mismatching-repositories</b>

              When enabled, an automatic upgrade will be triggered when
              a repository format does not match its
              <i>use-dirstate-tracked-hint</i> config.

              This is an advanced behavior that most users will not
              need. We recommend you don't use this unless you are a
              seasoned administrator of a Mercurial install base.

              Automatic upgrade means that any process accessing the
              repository will upgrade the repository format to use
              <i>dirstate-tracked-hint</i>. This only triggers if a change is
              needed. This also applies to operations that would have
              been read-only (like hg status).

              If the repository cannot be locked, the automatic-upgrade
              operation will be skipped. The next operation will attempt
              it again.

              This configuration will apply for moves in any direction,
              either adding the <i>dirstate-tracked-hint</i> format if
              <i>format.use-dirstate-tracked-hint=yes</i> or removing the
              <i>dirstate-tracked-hint</i> requirement if
              <i>format.use-dirstate-tracked-hint=no</i>. So we recommend
              setting both this value and
              <i>format.use-dirstate-tracked-hint</i> at the same time.

       <b>use-persistent-nodemap</b>

              Enable or disable the "persistent-nodemap" feature which
              improves performance if the Rust extensions are available.

              The "persistent-nodemap" persist the "node -&gt; rev" on disk
              removing the need to dynamically build that mapping for
              each Mercurial invocation. This significantly reduces the
              startup cost of various local and server-side operation
              for larger repositories.

              The performance-improving version of this feature is
              currently only implemented in Rust (see <b>hg help rust</b>), so
              people not using a version of Mercurial compiled with the
              Rust parts might actually suffer some slowdown.  For this
              reason, such versions will by default refuse to access
              repositories with "persistent-nodemap".

              This behavior can be adjusted via configuration: check <b>hg</b>
              <b>help config.storage.revlog.persistent-nodemap.slow-path</b>
              for details.

              Repositories with this on-disk format require Mercurial
              5.4 or above.

              By default this format variant is disabled if the fast
              implementation is not available, and enabled by default if
              the fast implementation is available.

              To accomodate installations of Mercurial without the fast
              implementation, you can downgrade your repository. To do
              so run the following command:

              <b>$ hg debugupgraderepo</b>
                     --run --config format.use-persistent-nodemap=False
                     --config
                     storage.revlog.persistent-nodemap.slow-path=allow

       <b>use-share-safe</b>

              Enforce "safe" behaviors for all "shares" that access this
              repository.

              With this feature, "shares" using this repository as a
              source will:

              • read the source repository's configuration
                (<i>&lt;source&gt;/.hg/hgrc</i>).

              • read and use the source repository's "requirements"
                (except the working copy specific one).

              Without this feature, "shares" using this repository as a
              source will:

              • keep tracking the repository "requirements" in the share
                only, ignoring the source "requirements", possibly
                diverging from them.

              • ignore source repository config. This can create
                problems, like silently ignoring important hooks.

              Beware that existing shares will not be
              upgraded/downgraded, and by default, Mercurial will refuse
              to interact with them until the mismatch is resolved. See
              <b>hg help config.share.safe-mismatch.source-safe </b>and <b>hg help</b>
              <b>config.share.safe-mismatch.source-not-safe </b>for details.

              Introduced in Mercurial 5.7.

              Enabled by default in Mercurial 6.1.

       <b>use-share-safe.automatic-upgrade-of-mismatching-repositories</b>

              When enabled, an automatic upgrade will be triggered when
              a repository format does not match its <i>use-share-safe</i>
              config.

              This is an advanced behavior that most users will not
              need. We recommend you don't use this unless you are a
              seasoned administrator of a Mercurial install base.

              Automatic upgrade means that any process accessing the
              repository will upgrade the repository format to use
              <i>share-safe</i>. This only triggers if a change is needed. This
              also applies to operation that would have been read-only
              (like hg status).

              If the repository cannot be locked, the automatic-upgrade
              operation will be skipped. The next operation will attempt
              it again.

              This configuration will apply for moves in any direction,

              <i>format.use-share-safe=yes</i> or removing the <i>share-safe</i>
              requirement if <i>format.use-share-safe=no</i>. So we recommend
              setting both this value and <i>format.use-share-safe</i> at the

       <b>usestore</b>

              Enable or disable the "store" repository format which
              improves compatibility with systems that fold case or
              otherwise mangle filenames. Disabling this option will
              allow you to store longer filenames in some situations at
              the expense of compatibility.

              Repositories with this on-disk format require Mercurial
              version 0.9.4.

              Enabled by default.

       <b>sparse-revlog</b>

              Enable or disable the <b>sparse-revlog </b>delta strategy. This
              format improves delta re-use inside revlog. For very
              branchy repositories, it results in a smaller store. For
              repositories with many revisions, it also helps
              performance (by using shortened delta chains.)

              Repositories with this on-disk format require Mercurial
              version 4.7

              Enabled by default.

       <b>revlog-compression</b>

              Compression algorithm used by revlog. Supported values are
              <i>zlib</i> and <i>zstd</i>. The <i>zlib</i> engine is the historical default
              of Mercurial. <i>zstd</i> is a newer format that is usually a net
              win over <i>zlib</i>, operating faster at better compression
              rates. Use <i>zstd</i> to reduce CPU usage. Multiple values can
              be specified, the first available one will be used.

              On some systems, the Mercurial installation may lack <i>zstd</i>
              support.

              Default is <i>zstd</i> if available, <i>zlib</i> otherwise.

       <b>bookmarks-in-store</b>

              Store bookmarks in .hg/store/. This means that bookmarks
              are shared when using <i>hg share</i> regardless of the <i>-B</i>
              option.

              Repositories with this on-disk format require Mercurial
              version 5.1.

              Disabled by default.

   <b>graph</b>
       Web graph view configuration. This section let you change graph
       elements display properties by branches, for instance to make the
       <b>default </b>branch stand out.

       Each line has the following format:

       &lt;branch&gt;.&lt;argument&gt; = &lt;value&gt;

       where <b>&lt;branch&gt; </b>is the name of the branch being customized.
       Example:

       [graph]
       # 2px width
       default.width = 2
       # red color
       default.color = FF0000

       Supported arguments:

       <b>width</b>

              Set branch edges width in pixels.

       <b>color</b>

              Set branch edges color in hexadecimal RGB notation.

   <b>hooks</b>
       Commands or Python functions that get automatically executed by
       various actions such as starting or finishing a commit. Multiple
       hooks can be run for the same action by appending a suffix to the
       action. Overriding a site-wide hook can be done by changing its
       value or setting it to an empty string.  Hooks can be prioritized
       by adding a prefix of <b>priority. </b>to the hook name on a new line
       and setting the priority. The default priority is 0.

       Example <b>.hg/hgrc</b>:

       [hooks]
       # update working directory after adding changesets
       changegroup.update = hg update
       # do not use the site-wide hook
       incoming =
       incoming.email = /my/email/hook
       incoming.autobuild = /my/build/hook
       # force autobuild hook to run before other incoming hooks
       priority.incoming.autobuild = 1
       ###  control HGPLAIN setting when running autobuild hook
       # HGPLAIN always set (default from Mercurial 5.7)
       incoming.autobuild:run-with-plain = yes
       # HGPLAIN never set
       incoming.autobuild:run-with-plain = no
       # HGPLAIN inherited from environment (default before Mercurial 5.7)
       incoming.autobuild:run-with-plain = auto

       Most hooks are run with environment variables set that give
       useful additional information. For each hook below, the
       environment variables it is passed are listed with names in the
       form <b>$HG_foo</b>. The <b>$HG_HOOKTYPE </b>and <b>$HG_HOOKNAME </b>variables are set
       for all hooks.  They contain the type of hook which triggered the
       run and the full name of the hook in the config, respectively. In
       the example above, this will be <b>$HG_HOOKTYPE=incoming </b>and
       <b>$HG_HOOKNAME=incoming.email</b>.

       Some basic Unix syntax can be enabled for portability, including
       <b>$VAR </b>and <b>${VAR} </b>style variables.  A <b>~ </b>followed by <b>\ </b>or <b>/ </b>will be
       expanded to <b>%USERPROFILE% </b>to simulate a subset of tilde expansion
       on Unix.  To use a literal <b>$ </b>or <b>~</b>, it must be escaped with a back
       slash or inside of a strong quote.  Strong quotes will be
       replaced by double quotes after processing.

       This feature is enabled by adding a prefix of <b>tonative. </b>to the
       hook name on a new line, and setting it to <b>True</b>.  For example:

       [hooks]
       incoming.autobuild = /my/build/hook
       # enable translation to cmd.exe syntax for autobuild hook
       tonative.incoming.autobuild = True

       <b>changegroup</b>

              Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or
              unbundle.  The ID of the first new changeset is in
              <b>$HG_NODE </b>and last is in <b>$HG_NODE_LAST</b>.  The URL from which
              changes came is in <b>$HG_URL</b>.

       <b>commit</b>

              Run after a changeset has been created in the local
              repository. The ID of the newly created changeset is in
              <b>$HG_NODE</b>. Parent changeset IDs are in <b>$HG_PARENT1 </b>and
              <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>.

       <b>incoming</b>

              Run after a changeset has been pulled, pushed, or
              unbundled into the local repository. The ID of the newly
              arrived changeset is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>. The URL that was source
              of the changes is in <b>$HG_URL</b>.

       <b>outgoing</b>

              Run after sending changes from the local repository to
              another. The ID of first changeset sent is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>.
              The source of operation is in <b>$HG_SOURCE</b>. Also see <b>hg help</b>
              <b>config.hooks.preoutgoing</b>.

       <b>post-&lt;command&gt;</b>

              Run after successful invocations of the associated
              command. The contents of the command line are passed as
              <b>$HG_ARGS </b>and the result code in <b>$HG_RESULT</b>. Parsed command
              line arguments are passed as <b>$HG_PATS </b>and <b>$HG_OPTS</b>. These
              contain string representations of the python data
              internally passed to &lt;command&gt;. <b>$HG_OPTS </b>is a dictionary
              of options (with unspecified options set to their
              defaults).  <b>$HG_PATS </b>is a list of arguments. Hook failure
              is ignored.

       <b>fail-&lt;command&gt;</b>

              Run after a failed invocation of an associated command.
              The contents of the command line are passed as <b>$HG_ARGS</b>.
              Parsed command line arguments are passed as <b>$HG_PATS </b>and
              <b>$HG_OPTS</b>. These contain string representations of the
              python data internally passed to &lt;command&gt;. <b>$HG_OPTS </b>is a
              dictionary of options (with unspecified options set to
              their defaults). <b>$HG_PATS </b>is a list of arguments.  Hook
              failure is ignored.

       <b>pre-&lt;command&gt;</b>

              Run before executing the associated command. The contents
              of the command line are passed as <b>$HG_ARGS</b>. Parsed command
              line arguments are passed as <b>$HG_PATS </b>and <b>$HG_OPTS</b>. These
              contain string representations of the data internally
              passed to &lt;command&gt;. <b>$HG_OPTS </b>is a dictionary of options
              (with unspecified options set to their defaults). <b>$HG_PATS</b>
              is a list of arguments. If the hook returns failure, the
              command doesn't execute and Mercurial returns the failure
              code.

       <b>prechangegroup</b>

              Run before a changegroup is added via push, pull or
              unbundle. Exit status 0 allows the changegroup to proceed.
              A non-zero status will cause the push, pull or unbundle to
              fail. The URL from which changes will come is in <b>$HG_URL</b>.

       <b>precommit</b>

              Run before starting a local commit. Exit status 0 allows
              the commit to proceed. A non-zero status will cause the
              commit to fail.  Parent changeset IDs are in <b>$HG_PARENT1</b>
              and <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>.

       <b>prelistkeys</b>

              Run before listing pushkeys (like bookmarks) in the
              repository. A non-zero status will cause failure. The key
              namespace is in <b>$HG_NAMESPACE</b>.

       <b>preoutgoing</b>

              Run before collecting changes to send from the local
              repository to another. A non-zero status will cause
              failure. This lets you prevent pull over HTTP or SSH. It
              can also prevent propagating commits (via local pull, push
              (outbound) or bundle commands), but not completely, since
              you can just copy files instead. The source of operation
              is in <b>$HG_SOURCE</b>. If "serve", the operation is happening
              on behalf of a remote SSH or HTTP repository. If "push",
              "pull" or "bundle", the operation is happening on behalf
              of a repository on same system.

       <b>prepushkey</b>

              Run before a pushkey (like a bookmark) is added to the
              repository. A non-zero status will cause the key to be
              rejected. The key namespace is in <b>$HG_NAMESPACE</b>, the key
              is in <b>$HG_KEY</b>, the old value (if any) is in <b>$HG_OLD</b>, and
              the new value is in <b>$HG_NEW</b>.

       <b>pretag</b>

              Run before creating a tag. Exit status 0 allows the tag to
              be created. A non-zero status will cause the tag to fail.
              The ID of the changeset to tag is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>. The name of
              tag is in <b>$HG_TAG</b>. The tag is local if <b>$HG_LOCAL=1</b>, or in
              the repository if <b>$HG_LOCAL=0</b>.

       <b>pretxnopen</b>

              Run before any new repository transaction is open. The
              reason for the transaction will be in <b>$HG_TXNNAME</b>, and a
              unique identifier for the transaction will be in
              <b>$HG_TXNID</b>. A non-zero status will prevent the transaction
              from being opened.

       <b>pretxnclose</b>

              Run right before the transaction is actually finalized.
              Any repository change will be visible to the hook program.
              This lets you validate the transaction content or change
              it. Exit status 0 allows the commit to proceed. A non-zero
              status will cause the transaction to be rolled back. The
              reason for the transaction opening will be in <b>$HG_TXNNAME</b>,
              and a unique identifier for the transaction will be in
              <b>$HG_TXNID</b>. The rest of the available data will vary
              according the transaction type.  Changes unbundled to the
              repository will add <b>$HG_URL </b>and <b>$HG_SOURCE</b>.  New
              changesets will add <b>$HG_NODE </b>(the ID of the first added
              changeset), <b>$HG_NODE_LAST </b>(the ID of the last added
              changeset).  Bookmark and phase changes will set
              <b>$HG_BOOKMARK_MOVED </b>and <b>$HG_PHASES_MOVED </b>to <b>1 </b>respectively.
              The number of new obsmarkers, if any, will be in
              <b>$HG_NEW_OBSMARKERS</b>, etc.

       <b>pretxnclose-bookmark</b>

              Run right before a bookmark change is actually finalized.
              Any repository change will be visible to the hook program.
              This lets you validate the transaction content or change
              it. Exit status 0 allows the commit to proceed. A non-zero
              status will cause the transaction to be rolled back.  The
              name of the bookmark will be available in <b>$HG_BOOKMARK</b>,
              the new bookmark location will be available in <b>$HG_NODE</b>
              while the previous location will be available in
              <b>$HG_OLDNODE</b>. In case of a bookmark creation <b>$HG_OLDNODE</b>
              will be empty. In case of deletion <b>$HG_NODE </b>will be empty.
              In addition, the reason for the transaction opening will
              be in <b>$HG_TXNNAME</b>, and a unique identifier for the
              transaction will be in <b>$HG_TXNID</b>.

       <b>pretxnclose-phase</b>

              Run right before a phase change is actually finalized. Any
              repository change will be visible to the hook program.
              This lets you validate the transaction content or change
              it. Exit status 0 allows the commit to proceed.  A
              non-zero status will cause the transaction to be rolled
              back. The hook is called multiple times, once for each
              revision affected by a phase change.  The affected node is
              available in <b>$HG_NODE</b>, the phase in <b>$HG_PHASE </b>while the
              previous <b>$HG_OLDPHASE</b>. In case of new node, <b>$HG_OLDPHASE</b>
              will be empty.  In addition, the reason for the
              transaction opening will be in <b>$HG_TXNNAME</b>, and a unique
              identifier for the transaction will be in <b>$HG_TXNID</b>. The
              hook is also run for newly added revisions. In this case
              the <b>$HG_OLDPHASE </b>entry will be empty.

       <b>txnclose</b>

              Run after any repository transaction has been committed.
              At this point, the transaction can no longer be rolled
              back. The hook will run after the lock is released. See <b>hg</b>
              <b>help config.hooks.pretxnclose </b>for details about available
              variables.

       <b>txnclose-bookmark</b>

              Run after any bookmark change has been committed. At this
              point, the transaction can no longer be rolled back. The
              hook will run after the lock is released. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>config.hooks.pretxnclose-bookmark </b>for details about
              available variables.

       <b>txnclose-phase</b>

              Run after any phase change has been committed. At this
              point, the transaction can no longer be rolled back. The
              hook will run after the lock is released. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>config.hooks.pretxnclose-phase </b>for details about available
              variables.

       <b>txnabort</b>

              Run when a transaction is aborted. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>config.hooks.pretxnclose </b>for details about available
              variables.

       <b>pretxnchangegroup</b>

              Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or
              unbundle, but before the transaction has been committed.
              The changegroup is visible to the hook program. This
              allows validation of incoming changes before accepting
              them.  The ID of the first new changeset is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>
              and last is in <b>$HG_NODE_LAST</b>. Exit status 0 allows the
              transaction to commit. A non-zero status will cause the
              transaction to be rolled back, and the push, pull or
              unbundle will fail. The URL that was the source of changes
              is in <b>$HG_URL</b>.

       <b>pretxncommit</b>

              Run after a changeset has been created, but before the
              transaction is committed. The changeset is visible to the
              hook program. This allows validation of the commit message
              and changes. Exit status 0 allows the commit to proceed. A
              non-zero status will cause the transaction to be rolled
              back. The ID of the new changeset is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>. The
              parent changeset IDs are in <b>$HG_PARENT1 </b>and <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>.

       <b>preupdate</b>

              Run before updating the working directory. Exit status 0
              allows the update to proceed. A non-zero status will
              prevent the update.  The changeset ID of first new parent
              is in <b>$HG_PARENT1</b>. If updating to a merge, the ID of
              second new parent is in <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>.

       <b>listkeys</b>

              Run after listing pushkeys (like bookmarks) in the
              repository. The key namespace is in <b>$HG_NAMESPACE</b>.
              <b>$HG_VALUES </b>is a dictionary containing the keys and values.

       <b>pushkey</b>

              Run after a pushkey (like a bookmark) is added to the
              repository. The key namespace is in <b>$HG_NAMESPACE</b>, the key
              is in <b>$HG_KEY</b>, the old value (if any) is in <b>$HG_OLD</b>, and
              the new value is in <b>$HG_NEW</b>.

       <b>tag</b>

              Run after a tag is created. The ID of the tagged changeset
              is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>.  The name of tag is in <b>$HG_TAG</b>. The tag is
              local if <b>$HG_LOCAL=1</b>, or in the repository if <b>$HG_LOCAL=0</b>.

       <b>update</b>

              Run after updating the working directory. The changeset ID
              of first new parent is in <b>$HG_PARENT1</b>. If updating to a
              merge, the ID of second new parent is in <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>. If
              the update succeeded, <b>$HG_ERROR=0</b>. If the update failed
              (e.g. because conflicts were not resolved), <b>$HG_ERROR=1</b>.

       Note   It is generally better to use standard hooks rather than
              the generic pre- and post- command hooks, as they are
              guaranteed to be called in the appropriate contexts for
              influencing transactions.  Also, hooks like "commit" will
              be called in all contexts that generate a commit (e.g.
              tag) and not just the commit command.

       Note   Environment variables with empty values may not be passed
              to hooks on platforms such as Windows. As an example,
              <b>$HG_PARENT2 </b>will have an empty value under Unix-like
              platforms for non-merge changesets, while it will not be
              available at all under Windows.

       The syntax for Python hooks is as follows:

       hookname = python:modulename.submodule.callable
       hookname = python:/path/to/python/module.py:callable

       Python hooks are run within the Mercurial process. Each hook is
       called with at least three keyword arguments: a ui object
       (keyword <b>ui</b>), a repository object (keyword <b>repo</b>), and a <b>hooktype</b>
       keyword that tells what kind of hook is used. Arguments listed as
       environment variables above are passed as keyword arguments, with
       no <b>HG_ </b>prefix, and names in lower case.

       If a Python hook returns a "true" value or raises an exception,
       this is treated as a failure.

   <b>hostfingerprints</b>
       (Deprecated. Use <b>[hostsecurity]</b>'s <b>fingerprints </b>options instead.)

       Fingerprints of the certificates of known HTTPS servers.

       A HTTPS connection to a server with a fingerprint configured here
       will only succeed if the servers certificate matches the
       fingerprint.  This is very similar to how ssh known hosts works.

       The fingerprint is the SHA-1 hash value of the DER encoded
       certificate.  Multiple values can be specified (separated by
       spaces or commas). This can be used to define both old and new
       fingerprints while a host transitions to a new certificate.

       The CA chain and web.cacerts is not used for servers with a
       fingerprint.

       For example:

       [hostfingerprints]
       hg.intevation.de = fc:e2:8d:d9:51:cd:cb:c1:4d:18:6b:b7:44:8d:49:72:57:e6:cd:33
       hg.intevation.org = fc:e2:8d:d9:51:cd:cb:c1:4d:18:6b:b7:44:8d:49:72:57:e6:cd:33

   <b>hostsecurity</b>
       Used to specify global and per-host security settings for
       connecting to other machines.

       The following options control default behavior for all hosts.

       <b>ciphers</b>

              Defines the cryptographic ciphers to use for connections.

              Value must be a valid OpenSSL Cipher List Format as
              documented at
              <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER-LIST-FORMAT">https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER-LIST-FORMAT</a>.

              This setting is for advanced users only. Setting to
              incorrect values can significantly lower connection
              security or decrease performance.  You have been warned.

              This option requires Python 2.7.

       <b>minimumprotocol</b>

              Defines the minimum channel encryption protocol to use.

              By default, the highest version of TLS supported by both
              client and server is used.

              Allowed values are: <b>tls1.0</b>, <b>tls1.1</b>, <b>tls1.2</b>.

              When running on an old Python version, only <b>tls1.0 </b>is
              allowed since old versions of Python only support up to
              TLS 1.0.

              When running a Python that supports modern TLS versions,
              the default is <b>tls1.1</b>. <b>tls1.0 </b>can still be used to allow
              TLS 1.0. However, this weakens security and should only be
              used as a feature of last resort if a server does not
              support TLS 1.1+.

       Options in the <b>[hostsecurity] </b>section can have the form
       <b>hostname</b>:<b>setting</b>. This allows multiple settings to be defined on
       a per-host basis.

       The following per-host settings can be defined.

       <b>ciphers</b>

              This behaves like <b>ciphers </b>as described above except it
              only applies to the host on which it is defined.

       <b>fingerprints</b>

              A list of hashes of the DER encoded peer/remote
              certificate. Values have the form <b>algorithm</b>:<b>fingerprint</b>.
              e.g.
              <b>sha256:c3ab8ff13720e8ad9047dd39466b3c8974e592c2fa383d4a3960714caef0c4f2</b>.
              In addition, colons (<b>:</b>) can appear in the fingerprint
              part.

              The following algorithms/prefixes are supported: <b>sha1</b>,
              <b>sha256</b>, <b>sha512</b>.

              Use of <b>sha256 </b>or <b>sha512 </b>is preferred.

              If a fingerprint is specified, the CA chain is not
              validated for this host and Mercurial will require the
              remote certificate to match one of the fingerprints
              specified. This means if the server updates its
              certificate, Mercurial will abort until a new fingerprint
              is defined.  This can provide stronger security than
              traditional CA-based validation at the expense of
              convenience.

              This option takes precedence over <b>verifycertsfile</b>.

       <b>minimumprotocol</b>

              This behaves like <b>minimumprotocol </b>as described above
              except it only applies to the host on which it is defined.

       <b>verifycertsfile</b>

              Path to file a containing a list of PEM encoded
              certificates used to verify the server certificate.
              Environment variables and <b>~user </b>constructs are expanded in
              the filename.

              The server certificate or the certificate's certificate
              authority (CA) must match a certificate from this file or
              certificate verification will fail and connections to the
              server will be refused.

              If defined, only certificates provided by this file will
              be used: <b>web.cacerts </b>and any system/default certificates
              will not be used.

              This option has no effect if the per-host <b>fingerprints</b>
              option is set.

              The format of the file is as follows:

              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----

       For example:

       [hostsecurity]
       hg.example.com:fingerprints = sha256:c3ab8ff13720e8ad9047dd39466b3c8974e592c2fa383d4a3960714caef0c4f2
       hg2.example.com:fingerprints = sha1:914f1aff87249c09b6859b88b1906d30756491ca, sha1:fc:e2:8d:d9:51:cd:cb:c1:4d:18:6b:b7:44:8d:49:72:57:e6:cd:33
       hg3.example.com:fingerprints = sha256:9a:b0:dc:e2:75:ad:8a:b7:84:58:e5:1f:07:32:f1:87:e6:bd:24:22:af:b7:ce:8e:9c:b4:10:cf:b9:f4:0e:d2
       foo.example.com:verifycertsfile = /etc/ssl/trusted-ca-certs.pem

       To change the default minimum protocol version to TLS 1.2 but to
       allow TLS 1.1 when connecting to <b>hg.example.com</b>:

       [hostsecurity]
       minimumprotocol = tls1.2
       hg.example.com:minimumprotocol = tls1.1

   <b>http_proxy</b>
       Used to access web-based Mercurial repositories through a HTTP
       proxy.

       <b>host</b>

              Host name and (optional) port of the proxy server, for
              example "myproxy:8000".

       <b>no</b>

              Optional. Comma-separated list of host names that should
              bypass the proxy.

       <b>passwd</b>

              Optional. Password to authenticate with at the proxy
              server.

       <b>user</b>

              Optional. User name to authenticate with at the proxy
              server.

       <b>always</b>

              Optional. Always use the proxy, even for localhost and any
              entries in <b>http_proxy.no</b>. (default: False)

   <b>http</b>
       Used to configure access to Mercurial repositories via HTTP.

       <b>timeout</b>

              If set, blocking operations will timeout after that many
              seconds.  (default: None)

   <b>merge</b>
       This section specifies behavior during merges and updates.

       <b>checkignored</b>

              Controls behavior when an ignored file on disk has the
              same name as a tracked file in the changeset being merged
              or updated to, and has different contents. Options are
              <b>abort</b>, <b>warn </b>and <b>ignore</b>. With <b>abort</b>, abort on such files.
              With <b>warn</b>, warn on such files and back them up as <b>.orig</b>.
              With <b>ignore</b>, don't print a warning and back them up as
              <b>.orig</b>. (default: <b>abort</b>)

       <b>checkunknown</b>

              Controls behavior when an unknown file that isn't ignored
              has the same name as a tracked file in the changeset being
              merged or updated to, and has different contents. Similar
              to <b>merge.checkignored</b>, except for files that are not
              ignored. (default: <b>abort</b>)

       <b>on-failure</b>

              When set to <b>continue </b>(the default), the merge process
              attempts to merge all unresolved files using the merge
              chosen tool, regardless of whether previous file merge
              attempts during the process succeeded or not.  Setting
              this to <b>prompt </b>will prompt after any merge failure
              continue or halt the merge process. Setting this to <b>halt</b>
              will automatically halt the merge process on any merge
              tool failure. The merge process can be restarted by using
              the <b>resolve </b>command. When a merge is halted, the
              repository is left in a normal <b>unresolved </b>merge state.
              (default: <b>continue</b>)

       <b>strict-capability-check</b>

              Whether capabilities of internal merge tools are checked
              strictly or not, while examining rules to decide merge
              tool to be used.  (default: False)

   <b>merge-patterns</b>
       This section specifies merge tools to associate with particular
       file patterns. Tools matched here will take precedence over the
       default merge tool. Patterns are globs by default, rooted at the
       repository root.

       Example:

       [merge-patterns]
       **.c = kdiff3
       **.jpg = myimgmerge

   <b>merge-tools</b>
       This section configures external merge tools to use for
       file-level merges. This section has likely been preconfigured at
       install time.  Use <b>hg config merge-tools </b>to check the existing
       configuration.  Also see <b>hg help merge-tools </b>for more details.

       Example <b>~/.hgrc</b>:

       [merge-tools]
       # Override stock tool location
       kdiff3.executable = ~/bin/kdiff3
       # Specify command line
       kdiff3.args = $base $local $other -o $output
       # Give higher priority
       kdiff3.priority = 1

       # Changing the priority of preconfigured tool
       meld.priority = 0

       # Disable a preconfigured tool
       vimdiff.disabled = yes

       # Define new tool
       myHtmlTool.args = -m $local $other $base $output
       myHtmlTool.regkey = Software\FooSoftware\HtmlMerge
       myHtmlTool.priority = 1

       Supported arguments:

       <b>priority</b>

              The priority in which to evaluate this tool.  (default: 0)

       <b>executable</b>

              Either just the name of the executable or its pathname.

              On Windows, the path can use environment variables with
              ${ProgramFiles} syntax.

              (default: the tool name)

       <b>args</b>

              The arguments to pass to the tool executable. You can
              refer to the files being merged as well as the output file
              through these variables: <b>$base</b>, <b>$local</b>, <b>$other</b>, <b>$output</b>.

              The meaning of <b>$local </b>and <b>$other </b>can vary depending on
              which action is being performed. During an update or
              merge, <b>$local </b>represents the original state of the file,
              while <b>$other </b>represents the commit you are updating to or
              the commit you are merging with. During a rebase, <b>$local</b>
              represents the destination of the rebase, and <b>$other</b>
              represents the commit being rebased.

              Some operations define custom labels to assist with
              identifying the revisions, accessible via <b>$labellocal</b>,
              <b>$labelother</b>, and <b>$labelbase</b>. If custom labels are not
              available, these will be <b>local</b>, <b>other</b>, and <b>base</b>,
              respectively.  (default: <b>$local $base $other</b>)

       <b>premerge</b>

              Attempt to run internal non-interactive 3-way merge tool
              before launching external tool.  Options are <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>,
              <b>keep</b>, <b>keep-merge3</b>, or <b>keep-mergediff </b>(experimental). The
              <b>keep </b>option will leave markers in the file if the premerge
              fails. The <b>keep-merge3 </b>will do the same but include
              information about the base of the merge in the marker (see
              internal :merge3 in <b>hg help merge-tools</b>). The
              <b>keep-mergediff </b>option is similar but uses a different
              marker style (see internal :merge3 in <b>hg help merge-tools</b>
              ). (default: True)

       <b>binary</b>

              This tool can merge binary files. (default: False, unless
              tool was selected by file pattern match)

       <b>symlink</b>

              This tool can merge symlinks. (default: False)

       <b>check</b>

              A list of merge success-checking options:

              <b>changed</b>

                     Ask whether merge was successful when the merged
                     file shows no changes.

              <b>conflicts</b>

                     Check whether there are conflicts even though the
                     tool reported success.

              <b>prompt</b>

                     Always prompt for merge success, regardless of
                     success reported by tool.

       <b>fixeol</b>

              Attempt to fix up EOL changes caused by the merge tool.
              (default: False)

       <b>gui</b>

              This tool requires a graphical interface to run. (default:
              False)

       <b>mergemarkers</b>

              Controls whether the labels passed via <b>$labellocal</b>,
              <b>$labelother</b>, and <b>$labelbase </b>are <b>detailed </b>(respecting
              <b>mergemarkertemplate</b>) or <b>basic</b>. If <b>premerge </b>is <b>keep </b>or
              <b>keep-merge3</b>, the conflict markers generated during
              premerge will be <b>detailed </b>if either this option or the
              corresponding option in the <b>[ui] </b>section is <b>detailed</b>.
              (default: <b>basic</b>)

       <b>mergemarkertemplate</b>

              This setting can be used to override <b>mergemarker </b>from the
              <b>[command-templates] </b>section on a per-tool basis; this
              applies to the <b>$label</b>-prefixed variables and to the
              conflict markers that are generated if <b>premerge </b>is <b>keep`</b>
              <b>or ``keep-merge3</b>. See the corresponding variable in <b>[ui]</b>
              for more information.

       <b>regkey</b>

              Windows registry key which describes install location of
              this tool. Mercurial will search for this key first under
              <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER </b>and then under <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>.
              (default: None)

       <b>regkeyalt</b>

              An alternate Windows registry key to try if the first key
              is not found.  The alternate key uses the same <b>regname </b>and
              <b>regappend </b>semantics of the primary key.  The most common
              use for this key is to search for 32bit applications on
              64bit operating systems.  (default: None)

       <b>regname</b>

              Name of value to read from specified registry key.
              (default: the unnamed (default) value)

       <b>regappend</b>

              String to append to the value read from the registry,
              typically the executable name of the tool.  (default:
              None)

   <b>pager</b>
       Setting used to control when to paginate and with what external
       tool. See <b>hg help pager </b>for details.

       <b>pager</b>

              Define the external tool used as pager.

              If no pager is set, Mercurial uses the environment
              variable $PAGER.  If neither pager.pager, nor $PAGER is
              set, a default pager will be used, typically <i>less</i> on Unix
              and <i>more</i> on Windows. Example:

              [pager]
              pager = less -FRX

       <b>ignore</b>

              List of commands to disable the pager for. Example:

              [pager]
              ignore = version, help, update

   <b>patch</b>
       Settings used when applying patches, for instance through the
       'import' command or with Mercurial Queues extension.

       <b>eol</b>

              When set to 'strict' patch content and patched files end
              of lines are preserved. When set to <b>lf </b>or <b>crlf</b>, both files
              end of lines are ignored when patching and the result line
              endings are normalized to either LF (Unix) or CRLF
              (Windows). When set to <b>auto</b>, end of lines are again
              ignored while patching but line endings in patched files
              are normalized to their original setting on a per-file
              basis. If target file does not exist or has no end of
              line, patch line endings are preserved.  (default: strict)

       <b>fuzz</b>

              The number of lines of 'fuzz' to allow when applying
              patches. This controls how much context the patcher is
              allowed to ignore when trying to apply a patch.  (default:
              2)

   <b>paths</b>
       Assigns symbolic names and behavior to repositories.

       Options are symbolic names defining the URL or directory that is
       the location of the repository. Example:

       [paths]
       my_server = <a href="https://example.com/my_repo">https://example.com/my_repo</a>
       local_path = /home/me/repo

       These symbolic names can be used from the command line. To pull
       from <b>my_server</b>: <b>hg pull my_server</b>. To push to <b>local_path</b>: <b>hg push</b>
       <b>local_path</b>. You can check <b>hg help urls </b>for details about valid
       URLs.

       Options containing colons (<b>:</b>) denote sub-options that can
       influence behavior for that specific path. Example:

       [paths]
       my_server = <a href="https://example.com/my_path">https://example.com/my_path</a>
       my_server:pushurl = ssh://example.com/my_path

       Paths using the <i>path://otherpath</i> scheme will inherit the
       sub-options value from the path they point to.

       The following sub-options can be defined:

       <b>multi-urls</b>

              A boolean option. When enabled the value of the <i>[paths]</i>
              entry will be parsed as a list and the alias will resolve
              to multiple destination. If some of the list entry use the
              <i>path://</i> syntax, the suboption will be inherited
              individually.

       <b>pushurl</b>

              The URL to use for push operations. If not defined, the
              location defined by the path's main entry is used.

       <b>pushrev</b>

              A revset defining which revisions to push by default.

              When <b>hg push </b>is executed without a <b>-r </b>argument, the revset
              defined by this sub-option is evaluated to determine what
              to push.

              For example, a value of <b>. </b>will push the working
              directory's revision by default.

              Revsets specifying bookmarks will not result in the
              bookmark being pushed.

       <b>bookmarks.mode</b>

              How bookmark will be dealt during the exchange. It support
              the following value

              • <b>default</b>: the default behavior, local and remote
                bookmarks are "merged" on push/pull.

              • <b>mirror</b>: when pulling, replace local bookmarks by remote
                bookmarks. This is useful to replicate a repository, or
                as an optimization.

              • <b>ignore</b>: ignore bookmarks during exchange.  (This
                currently only affect pulling)

       The following special named paths exist:

       <b>default</b>

              The URL or directory to use when no source or remote is
              specified.

              <b>hg clone </b>will automatically define this path to the
              location the repository was cloned from.

       <b>default-push</b>

              (deprecated) The URL or directory for the default <b>hg push</b>
              location.  <b>default:pushurl </b>should be used instead.

   <b>phases</b>
       Specifies default handling of phases. See <b>hg help phases </b>for more
       information about working with phases.

       <b>publish</b>

              Controls draft phase behavior when working as a server.
              When true, pushed changesets are set to public in both
              client and server and pulled or cloned changesets are set
              to public in the client.  (default: True)

       <b>new-commit</b>

              Phase of newly-created commits.  (default: draft)

       <b>checksubrepos</b>

              Check the phase of the current revision of each
              subrepository. Allowed values are "ignore", "follow" and
              "abort". For settings other than "ignore", the phase of
              the current revision of each subrepository is checked
              before committing the parent repository. If any of those
              phases is greater than the phase of the parent repository
              (e.g. if a subrepo is in a "secret" phase while the parent
              repo is in "draft" phase), the commit is either aborted
              (if checksubrepos is set to "abort") or the higher phase
              is used for the parent repository commit (if set to
              "follow").  (default: follow)

   <b>profiling</b>
       Specifies profiling type, format, and file output. Two profilers
       are supported: an instrumenting profiler (named <b>ls</b>), and a
       sampling profiler (named <b>stat</b>).

       In this section description, 'profiling data' stands for the raw
       data collected during profiling, while 'profiling report' stands
       for a statistical text report generated from the profiling data.

       <b>enabled</b>

              Enable the profiler.  (default: false)

              This is equivalent to passing <b>--profile </b>on the command
              line.

       <b>type</b>

              The type of profiler to use.  (default: stat)

              <b>ls</b>

                     Use Python's built-in instrumenting profiler. This
                     profiler works on all platforms, but each line
                     number it reports is the first line of a function.
                     This restriction makes it difficult to identify the
                     expensive parts of a non-trivial function.

              <b>stat</b>

                     Use a statistical profiler, statprof. This profiler
                     is most useful for profiling commands that run for
                     longer than about 0.1 seconds.

       <b>format</b>

              Profiling format.  Specific to the <b>ls </b>instrumenting
              profiler.  (default: text)

              <b>text</b>

                     Generate a profiling report. When saving to a file,
                     it should be noted that only the report is saved,
                     and the profiling data is not kept.

              <b>kcachegrind</b>

                     Format profiling data for kcachegrind use: when
                     saving to a file, the generated file can directly
                     be loaded into kcachegrind.

       <b>statformat</b>

              Profiling format for the <b>stat </b>profiler.  (default:
              hotpath)

              <b>hotpath</b>

                     Show a tree-based display containing the hot path
                     of execution (where most time was spent).

              <b>bymethod</b>

                     Show a table of methods ordered by how frequently
                     they are active.

              <b>byline</b>

                     Show a table of lines in files ordered by how
                     frequently they are active.

              <b>json</b>

                     Render profiling data as JSON.

       <b>freq</b>

              Sampling frequency.  Specific to the <b>stat </b>sampling
              profiler.  (default: 1000)

       <b>output</b>

              File path where profiling data or report should be saved.
              If the file exists, it is replaced. (default: None, data
              is printed on stderr)

       <b>sort</b>

              Sort field.  Specific to the <b>ls </b>instrumenting profiler.
              One of <b>callcount</b>, <b>reccallcount</b>, <b>totaltime </b>and <b>inlinetime</b>.
              (default: inlinetime)

       <b>time-track</b>

              Control if the stat profiler track <b>cpu </b>or <b>real </b>time.
              (default: <b>cpu </b>on Windows, otherwise <b>real</b>)

       <b>limit</b>

              Number of lines to show. Specific to the <b>ls </b>instrumenting
              profiler.  (default: 30)

       <b>nested</b>

              Show at most this number of lines of drill-down info after
              each main entry.  This can help explain the difference
              between Total and Inline.  Specific to the <b>ls</b>
              instrumenting profiler.  (default: 0)

       <b>showmin</b>

              Minimum fraction of samples an entry must have for it to
              be displayed.  Can be specified as a float between <b>0.0 </b>and
              <b>1.0 </b>or can have a <b>% </b>afterwards to allow values up to <b>100</b>.
              e.g. <b>5%</b>.

              Only used by the <b>stat </b>profiler.

              For the <b>hotpath </b>format, default is <b>0.05</b>.  For the <b>chrome</b>
              format, default is <b>0.005</b>.

              The option is unused on other formats.

       <b>showmax</b>

              Maximum fraction of samples an entry can have before it is
              ignored in display. Values format is the same as <b>showmin</b>.

              Only used by the <b>stat </b>profiler.

              For the <b>chrome </b>format, default is <b>0.999</b>.

              The option is unused on other formats.

       <b>showtime</b>

              Show time taken as absolute durations, in addition to
              percentages.  Only used by the <b>hotpath </b>format.  (default:
              true)

   <b>progress</b>
       Mercurial commands can draw progress bars that are as informative
       as possible. Some progress bars only offer indeterminate
       information, while others have a definite end point.

       <b>debug</b>

              Whether to print debug info when updating the progress
              bar. (default: False)

       <b>delay</b>

              Number of seconds (float) before showing the progress bar.
              (default: 3)

       <b>changedelay</b>

              Minimum delay before showing a new topic. When set to less
              than 3 * refresh, that value will be used instead.
              (default: 1)

       <b>estimateinterval</b>

              Maximum sampling interval in seconds for speed and
              estimated time calculation. (default: 60)

       <b>refresh</b>

              Time in seconds between refreshes of the progress bar.
              (default: 0.1)

       <b>format</b>

              Format of the progress bar.

              Valid entries for the format field are <b>topic</b>, <b>bar</b>, <b>number</b>,
              <b>unit</b>, <b>estimate</b>, <b>speed</b>, and <b>item</b>. <b>item </b>defaults to the last
              20 characters of the item, but this can be changed by
              adding either <b>-&lt;num&gt; </b>which would take the last num
              characters, or <b>+&lt;num&gt; </b>for the first num characters.

              (default: topic bar number estimate)

       <b>width</b>

              If set, the maximum width of the progress information
              (that is, min(width, term width) will be used).

       <b>clear-complete</b>

              Clear the progress bar after it's done. (default: True)

       <b>disable</b>

              If true, don't show a progress bar.

       <b>assume-tty</b>

              If true, ALWAYS show a progress bar, unless disable is
              given.

   <b>rebase</b>
       <b>evolution.allowdivergence</b>

              Default to False, when True allow creating divergence when
              performing rebase of obsolete changesets.

   <b>revsetalias</b>
       Alias definitions for revsets. See <b>hg help revsets </b>for details.

   <b>rewrite</b>
       <b>backup-bundle</b>

              Whether to save stripped changesets to a bundle file.
              (default: True)

       <b>update-timestamp</b>

              If true, updates the date and time of the changeset to
              current. It is only applicable for <i>hg amend</i>, <i>hg commit</i>
              <i>--amend</i> and <i>hg uncommit</i> in the current version.

       <b>empty-successor</b>

          Control what happens with empty successors that are the result
          of rewrite operations. If set to <b>skip</b>, the successor is not
          created. If set to <b>keep</b>, the empty successor is created and
          kept.

          Currently, only the rebase and absorb commands consider this
          configuration.  (EXPERIMENTAL)

   <b>share</b>
       <b>safe-mismatch.source-safe</b>

              Controls what happens when the shared repository does not
              use the share-safe mechanism but its source repository
              does.

   <b>storage</b>
       Control the strategy Mercurial uses internally to store history.
       Options in this category impact performance and repository size.

       <b>revlog.issue6528.fix-incoming</b>

              Version 5.8 of Mercurial had a bug leading to altering the
              parent of file revision with copy information (or any
              other metadata) on exchange. This leads to the copy
              metadata to be overlooked by various internal logic. The
              issue was fixed in Mercurial 5.8.1.  (See
              <a href="https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6528">https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6528</a> for
              details)

              As a result Mercurial is now checking and fixing incoming
              file revisions to make sure there parents are in the right
              order. This behavior can be disabled by setting this
              option to <i>no</i>. This apply to revisions added through push,
              pull, clone and unbundle.

              To fix affected revisions that already exist within the
              repository, one can use <b>hg debug-repair-issue-6528</b>.

       <b>revlog.optimize-delta-parent-choice</b>

              When storing a merge revision, both parents will be
              equally considered as a possible delta base. This results
              in better delta selection and improved revlog compression.
              This option is enabled by default.

              Turning this option off can result in large increase of
              repository size for repository with many merges.

       <b>revlog.persistent-nodemap.mmap</b>

              Whether to use the Operating System "memory mapping"
              feature (when possible) to access the persistent nodemap
              data. This improve performance and reduce memory pressure.

              Default to True.

              For details on the "persistent-nodemap" feature, see: <b>hg</b>
              <b>help config.format.use-persistent-nodemap</b>.

       <b>revlog.persistent-nodemap.slow-path</b>

              Control the behavior of Merucrial when using a repository
              with "persistent" nodemap with an installation of
              Mercurial without a fast implementation for the feature:

              <b>allow</b>: Silently use the slower implementation to access
              the repository.  <b>warn</b>: Warn, but use the slower
              implementation to access the repository.  <b>abort</b>: Prevent
              access to such repositories. (This is the default)

              For details on the "persistent-nodemap" feature, see: <b>hg</b>
              <b>help config.format.use-persistent-nodemap</b>.

       <b>revlog.reuse-external-delta-parent</b>

              Control the order in which delta parents are considered
              when adding new revisions from an external source.
              (typically: apply bundle from <i>hg pull</i> or <i>hg push</i>).

              New revisions are usually provided as a delta against
              other revisions. By default, Mercurial will try to reuse
              this delta first, therefore using the same "delta parent"
              as the source. Directly using delta's from the source
              reduces CPU usage and usually speeds up operation.
              However, in some case, the source might have sub-optimal
              delta bases and forcing their reevaluation is useful. For
              example, pushes from an old client could have sub-optimal
              delta's parent that the server want to optimize. (lack of
              general delta, bad parents, choice, lack of sparse-revlog,
              etc).

              This option is enabled by default. Turning it off will
              ensure bad delta parent choices from older client do not
              propagate to this repository, at the cost of a small
              increase in CPU consumption.

              Note: this option only control the order in which delta
              parents are considered.  Even when disabled, the existing
              delta from the source will be reused if the same delta
              parent is selected.

       <b>revlog.reuse-external-delta</b>

              Control the reuse of delta from external source.
              (typically: apply bundle from <i>hg pull</i> or <i>hg push</i>).

              New revisions are usually provided as a delta against
              another revision. By default, Mercurial will not recompute
              the same delta again, trusting externally provided deltas.
              There have been rare cases of small adjustment to the
              diffing algorithm in the past. So in some rare case,
              recomputing delta provided by ancient clients can provides
              better results. Disabling this option means going through
              a full delta recomputation for all incoming revisions. It
              means a large increase in CPU usage and will slow
              operations down.

              This option is enabled by default. When disabled, it also
              disables the related
              <b>storage.revlog.reuse-external-delta-parent </b>option.

       <b>revlog.zlib.level</b>

              Zlib compression level used when storing data into the
              repository. Accepted Value range from 1 (lowest
              compression) to 9 (highest compression). Zlib default
              value is 6.

       <b>revlog.zstd.level</b>

              zstd compression level used when storing data into the
              repository. Accepted Value range from 1 (lowest
              compression) to 22 (highest compression).  (default 3)

   <b>server</b>
       Controls generic server settings.

       <b>bookmarks-pushkey-compat</b>

              Trigger pushkey hook when being pushed bookmark updates.
              This config exist for compatibility purpose (default to
              True)

              If you use <b>pushkey </b>and <b>pre-pushkey </b>hooks to control
              bookmark movement we recommend you migrate them to
              <b>txnclose-bookmark </b>and <b>pretxnclose-bookmark</b>.

       <b>compressionengines</b>

              List of compression engines and their relative priority to
              advertise to clients.

              The order of compression engines determines their
              priority, the first having the highest priority. If a
              compression engine is not listed here, it won't be
              advertised to clients.

              If not set (the default), built-in defaults are used. Run
              <b>hg debuginstall </b>to list available compression engines and
              their default wire protocol priority.

              Older Mercurial clients only support zlib compression and
              this setting has no effect for legacy clients.

       <b>uncompressed</b>

              Whether to allow clients to clone a repository using the
              uncompressed streaming protocol. This transfers about 40%
              more data than a regular clone, but uses less memory and
              CPU on both server and client. Over a LAN (100 Mbps or
              better) or a very fast WAN, an uncompressed streaming
              clone is a lot faster (~10x) than a regular clone. Over
              most WAN connections (anything slower than about 6 Mbps),
              uncompressed streaming is slower, because of the extra
              data transfer overhead. This mode will also temporarily
              hold the write lock while determining what data to
              transfer.  (default: True)

       <b>uncompressedallowsecret</b>

              Whether to allow stream clones when the repository
              contains secret changesets. (default: False)

       <b>preferuncompressed</b>

              When set, clients will try to use the uncompressed
              streaming protocol. (default: False)

       <b>disablefullbundle</b>

              When set, servers will refuse attempts to do pull-based
              clones.  If this option is set, <b>preferuncompressed </b>and/or
              clone bundles are highly recommended. Partial clones will
              still be allowed.  (default: False)

       <b>streamunbundle</b>

              When set, servers will apply data sent from the client
              directly, otherwise it will be written to a temporary file
              first. This option effectively prevents concurrent pushes.

       <b>pullbundle</b>

              When set, the server will check pullbundles.manifest for
              bundles covering the requested heads and common nodes. The
              first matching entry will be streamed to the client.

              For HTTP transport, the stream will still use zlib
              compression for older clients.

       <b>concurrent-push-mode</b>

              Level of allowed race condition between two pushing
              clients.

              • 'strict': push is abort if another client touched the
                repository while the push was preparing.

              • 'check-related': push is only aborted if it affects head
                that got also affected while the push was preparing.
                (default since 5.4)

              'check-related' only takes effect for compatible clients
              (version 4.3 and later). Older clients will use 'strict'.

       <b>validate</b>

              Whether to validate the completeness of pushed changesets
              by checking that all new file revisions specified in
              manifests are present. (default: False)

       <b>maxhttpheaderlen</b>

              Instruct HTTP clients not to send request headers longer
              than this many bytes. (default: 1024)

       <b>bundle1</b>

              Whether to allow clients to push and pull using the legacy
              bundle1 exchange format. (default: True)

       <b>bundle1gd</b>

              Like <b>bundle1 </b>but only used if the repository is using the
              <i>generaldelta</i> storage format. (default: True)

       <b>bundle1.push</b>

              Whether to allow clients to push using the legacy bundle1
              exchange format. (default: True)

       <b>bundle1gd.push</b>

              Like <b>bundle1.push </b>but only used if the repository is using
              the <i>generaldelta</i> storage format. (default: True)

       <b>bundle1.pull</b>

              Whether to allow clients to pull using the legacy bundle1
              exchange format. (default: True)

       <b>bundle1gd.pull</b>

              Like <b>bundle1.pull </b>but only used if the repository is using
              the <i>generaldelta</i> storage format. (default: True)

              Large repositories using the <i>generaldelta</i> storage format
              should consider setting this option because converting
              <i>generaldelta</i> repositories to the exchange format required
              by the bundle1 data format can consume a lot of CPU.

       <b>bundle2.stream</b>

              Whether to allow clients to pull using the bundle2
              streaming protocol.  (default: True)

       <b>zliblevel</b>

              Integer between <b>-1 </b>and <b>9 </b>that controls the zlib
              compression level for wire protocol commands that send
              zlib compressed output (notably the commands that send
              repository history data).

              The default (<b>-1</b>) uses the default zlib compression level,
              which is likely equivalent to <b>6</b>. <b>0 </b>means no compression. <b>9</b>
              means maximum compression.

              Setting this option allows server operators to make
              trade-offs between bandwidth and CPU used. Lowering the
              compression lowers CPU utilization but sends more bytes to
              clients.

              This option only impacts the HTTP server.

       <b>zstdlevel</b>

              Integer between <b>1 </b>and <b>22 </b>that controls the zstd
              compression level for wire protocol commands. <b>1 </b>is the
              minimal amount of compression and <b>22 </b>is the highest amount
              of compression.

              The default (<b>3</b>) should be significantly faster than zlib
              while likely delivering better compression ratios.

              This option only impacts the HTTP server.

              See also <b>server.zliblevel</b>.

       <b>view</b>

              Repository filter used when exchanging revisions with the
              peer.

              The default view (<b>served</b>) excludes secret and hidden
              changesets.  Another useful value is <b>immutable </b>(no draft,
              secret or hidden changesets). (EXPERIMENTAL)

   <b>smtp</b>
       Configuration for extensions that need to send email messages.

       <b>host</b>

              Host name of mail server, e.g. "mail.example.com".

       <b>port</b>

              Optional. Port to connect to on mail server. (default: 465
              if <b>tls </b>is smtps; 25 otherwise)

       <b>tls</b>

              Optional. Method to enable TLS when connecting to mail
              server: starttls, smtps or none. (default: none)

       <b>username</b>

              Optional. User name for authenticating with the SMTP
              server.  (default: None)

       <b>password</b>

              Optional. Password for authenticating with the SMTP
              server. If not specified, interactive sessions will prompt
              the user for a password; non-interactive sessions will
              fail. (default: None)

       <b>local_hostname</b>

              Optional. The hostname that the sender can use to identify
              itself to the MTA.

   <b>subpaths</b>
       Subrepository source URLs can go stale if a remote server changes
       name or becomes temporarily unavailable. This section lets you
       define rewrite rules of the form:

       &lt;pattern&gt; = &lt;replacement&gt;

       where <b>pattern </b>is a regular expression matching a subrepository
       source URL and <b>replacement </b>is the replacement string used to
       rewrite it. Groups can be matched in <b>pattern </b>and referenced in
       <b>replacements</b>. For instance:

       <a href="http://server/(.*)-hg/">http://server/(.*)-hg/</a> = <a href="#">http://hg.server/\1/</a>

       rewrites <b>http://server/foo-hg/ </b>into <b><a href="http://hg.server/foo/">http://hg.server/foo/</a> </b>.

       Relative subrepository paths are first made absolute, and the
       rewrite rules are then applied on the full (absolute) path. If
       <b>pattern </b>doesn't match the full path, an attempt is made to apply
       it on the relative path alone. The rules are applied in
       definition order.

   <b>subrepos</b>
       This section contains options that control the behavior of the
       subrepositories feature. See also <b>hg help subrepos</b>.

       Security note: auditing in Mercurial is known to be insufficient
       to prevent clone-time code execution with carefully constructed
       Git subrepos. It is unknown if a similar detect is present in
       Subversion subrepos. Both Git and Subversion subrepos are
       disabled by default out of security concerns. These subrepo types
       can be enabled using the respective options below.

       <b>allowed</b>

              Whether subrepositories are allowed in the working
              directory.

              When false, commands involving subrepositories (like <b>hg</b>
              <b>update</b>) will fail for all subrepository types.  (default:
              true)

       <b>hg:allowed</b>

              Whether Mercurial subrepositories are allowed in the
              working directory. This option only has an effect if
              <b>subrepos.allowed </b>is true.  (default: true)

       <b>git:allowed</b>

              Whether Git subrepositories are allowed in the working
              directory.  This option only has an effect if
              <b>subrepos.allowed </b>is true.

              See the security note above before enabling Git subrepos.
              (default: false)

       <b>svn:allowed</b>

              Whether Subversion subrepositories are allowed in the
              working directory. This option only has an effect if
              <b>subrepos.allowed </b>is true.

              See the security note above before enabling Subversion
              subrepos.  (default: false)

   <b>templatealias</b>
       Alias definitions for templates. See <b>hg help templates </b>for
       details.

   <b>templates</b>
       Use the <b>[templates] </b>section to define template strings.  See <b>hg</b>
       <b>help templates </b>for details.

   <b>trusted</b>
       Mercurial will not use the settings in the <b>.hg/hgrc </b>file from a
       repository if it doesn't belong to a trusted user or to a trusted
       group, as various hgrc features allow arbitrary commands to be
       run. This issue is often encountered when configuring hooks or
       extensions for shared repositories or servers. However, the web
       interface will use some safe settings from the <b>[web] </b>section.

       This section specifies what users and groups are trusted. The
       current user is always trusted. To trust everybody, list a user
       or a group with name <b>*</b>. These settings must be placed in an
       <i>already-trusted file</i> to take effect, such as <b>$HOME/.hgrc </b>of the
       user or service running Mercurial.

       <b>users</b>

              Comma-separated list of trusted users.

       <b>groups</b>

              Comma-separated list of trusted groups.

   <b>ui</b>
       User interface controls.

       <b>archivemeta</b>

              Whether to include the .hg_archival.txt file containing
              meta data (hashes for the repository base and for tip) in
              archives created by the <b>hg archive </b>command or downloaded
              via hgweb.  (default: True)

       <b>askusername</b>

              Whether to prompt for a username when committing. If True,
              and neither <b>$HGUSER </b>nor <b>$EMAIL </b>has been specified, then
              the user will be prompted to enter a username. If no
              username is entered, the default <b>USER@HOST </b>is used
              instead.  (default: False)

       <b>clonebundles</b>

              Whether the "clone bundles" feature is enabled.

              When enabled, <b>hg clone </b>may download and apply a
              server-advertised bundle file from a URL instead of using
              the normal exchange mechanism.

              This can likely result in faster and more reliable clones.

              (default: True)

       <b>clonebundlefallback</b>

              Whether failure to apply an advertised "clone bundle" from
              a server should result in fallback to a regular clone.

              This is disabled by default because servers advertising
              "clone bundles" often do so to reduce server load. If
              advertised bundles start mass failing and clients
              automatically fall back to a regular clone, this would add
              significant and unexpected load to the server since the
              server is expecting clone operations to be offloaded to
              pre-generated bundles. Failing fast (the default behavior)
              ensures clients don't overwhelm the server when "clone
              bundle" application fails.

              (default: False)

       <b>clonebundleprefers</b>

              Defines preferences for which "clone bundles" to use.

              Servers advertising "clone bundles" may advertise multiple
              available bundles. Each bundle may have different
              attributes, such as the bundle type and compression
              format. This option is used to prefer a particular bundle
              over another.

              The following keys are defined by Mercurial:

              <b>BUNDLESPEC</b>
                     A bundle type specifier. These are strings passed
                     to <b>hg bundle -t</b>.  e.g. <b>gzip-v2 </b>or <b>bzip2-v1</b>.

              <b>COMPRESSION</b>
                     The compression format of the bundle. e.g. <b>gzip </b>and
                     <b>bzip2</b>.

              Server operators may define custom keys.

              Example values: <b>COMPRESSION=bzip2</b>, <b>BUNDLESPEC=gzip-v2,</b>
              <b>COMPRESSION=gzip</b>.

              By default, the first bundle advertised by the server is
              used.

       <b>color</b>

              When to colorize output. Possible value are Boolean ("yes"
              or "no"), or "debug", or "always". (default: "yes"). "yes"
              will use color whenever it seems possible. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>color </b>for details.

       <b>commitsubrepos</b>

              Whether to commit modified subrepositories when committing
              the parent repository. If False and one subrepository has
              uncommitted changes, abort the commit.  (default: False)

       <b>debug</b>

              Print debugging information. (default: False)

       <b>editor</b>

              The editor to use during a commit. (default: <b>$EDITOR </b>or
              <b>vi</b>)

       <b>fallbackencoding</b>

              Encoding to try if it's not possible to decode the
              changelog using UTF-8. (default: ISO-8859-1)

       <b>graphnodetemplate</b>

              (DEPRECATED) Use <b>command-templates.graphnode </b>instead.

       <b>ignore</b>

              A file to read per-user ignore patterns from. This file
              should be in the same format as a repository-wide
              .hgignore file. Filenames are relative to the repository
              root. This option supports hook syntax, so if you want to
              specify multiple ignore files, you can do so by setting
              something like <b>ignore.other = ~/.hgignore2</b>. For details of
              the ignore file format, see the <a href="hgignore.5.html">hgignore(5)</a> man page.

       <b>interactive</b>

              Allow to prompt the user. (default: True)

       <b>interface</b>

              Select the default interface for interactive features
              (default: text).  Possible values are 'text' and 'curses'.

       <b>interface.chunkselector</b>

              Select the interface for change recording (e.g. <b>hg commit</b>
              <b>-i</b>).  Possible values are 'text' and 'curses'.  This
              config overrides the interface specified by ui.interface.

       <b>large-file-limit</b>

              Largest file size that gives no memory use warning.
              Possible values are integers or 0 to disable the check.
              Value is expressed in bytes by default, one can use
              standard units for convenience (e.g. 10MB, 0.1GB, etc)
              (default: 10MB)

       <b>logtemplate</b>

              (DEPRECATED) Use <b>command-templates.log </b>instead.

       <b>merge</b>

              The conflict resolution program to use during a manual
              merge.  For more information on merge tools see <b>hg help</b>
              <b>merge-tools</b>.  For configuring merge tools see the
              <b>[merge-tools] </b>section.

       <b>mergemarkers</b>

              Sets the merge conflict marker label styling. The <b>detailed</b>
              style uses the <b>command-templates.mergemarker </b>setting to
              style the labels.  The <b>basic </b>style just uses 'local' and
              'other' as the marker label.  One of <b>basic </b>or <b>detailed</b>.
              (default: <b>basic</b>)

       <b>mergemarkertemplate</b>

              (DEPRECATED) Use <b>command-templates.mergemarker </b>instead.

       <b>message-output</b>

              Where to write status and error messages. (default: <b>stdio</b>)

              <b>channel</b>

                     Use separate channel for structured output.
                     (Command-server only)

              <b>stderr</b>

                     Everything to stderr.

              <b>stdio</b>

                     Status to stdout, and error to stderr.

       <b>origbackuppath</b>

              The path to a directory used to store generated .orig
              files. If the path is not a directory, one will be
              created.  If set, files stored in this directory have the
              same name as the original file and do not have a .orig
              suffix.

       <b>paginate</b>

              Control the pagination of command output (default: True).
              See <b>hg help pager </b>for details.

       <b>patch</b>

              An optional external tool that <b>hg import </b>and some
              extensions will use for applying patches. By default
              Mercurial uses an internal patch utility. The external
              tool must work as the common Unix <b>patch </b>program. In
              particular, it must accept a <b>-p </b>argument to strip patch
              headers, a <b>-d </b>argument to specify the current directory, a
              file name to patch, and a patch file to take from stdin.

              It is possible to specify a patch tool together with extra
              arguments. For example, setting this option to <b>patch</b>
              <b>--merge </b>will use the <b>patch </b>program with its 2-way merge
              option.

       <b>portablefilenames</b>

              Check for portable filenames. Can be <b>warn</b>, <b>ignore </b>or
              <b>abort</b>.  (default: <b>warn</b>)

              <b>warn</b>

                     Print a warning message on POSIX platforms, if a
                     file with a non-portable filename is added (e.g. a
                     file with a name that can't be created on Windows
                     because it contains reserved parts like <b>AUX</b>,
                     reserved characters like <b>:</b>, or would cause a case
                     collision with an existing file).

              <b>ignore</b>

                     Don't print a warning.

              <b>abort</b>

                     The command is aborted.

              <b>true</b>

                     Alias for <b>warn</b>.

              <b>false</b>

                     Alias for <b>ignore</b>.

              On Windows, this configuration option is ignored and the
              command aborted.

       <b>pre-merge-tool-output-template</b>

              (DEPRECATED) Use <b>command-template.pre-merge-tool-output</b>
              instead.

       <b>quiet</b>

              Reduce the amount of output printed.  (default: False)

       <b>relative-paths</b>

              Prefer relative paths in the UI.

       <b>remotecmd</b>

              Remote command to use for clone/push/pull operations.
              (default: <b>hg</b>)

       <b>report_untrusted</b>

              Warn if a <b>.hg/hgrc </b>file is ignored due to not being owned
              by a trusted user or group.  (default: True)

       <b>slash</b>

              (Deprecated. Use <b>slashpath </b>template filter instead.)

              Display paths using a slash (<b>/</b>) as the path separator.
              This only makes a difference on systems where the default
              path separator is not the slash character (e.g. Windows
              uses the backslash character (<b>\</b>)).  (default: False)

       <b>statuscopies</b>

              Display copies in the status command.

       <b>ssh</b>

              Command to use for SSH connections. (default: <b>ssh</b>)

       <b>ssherrorhint</b>

              A hint shown to the user in the case of SSH error (e.g.
              <b>Please see <a href="#">http://company/internalwiki/ssh.html</a></b>)

       <b>strict</b>

              Require exact command names, instead of allowing
              unambiguous abbreviations. (default: False)

       <b>style</b>

              Name of style to use for command output.

       <b>supportcontact</b>

              A URL where users should report a Mercurial traceback. Use
              this if you are a large organisation with its own
              Mercurial deployment process and crash reports should be
              addressed to your internal support.

       <b>textwidth</b>

              Maximum width of help text. A longer line generated by <b>hg</b>
              <b>help </b>or <b>hg subcommand --help </b>will be broken after white
              space to get this width or the terminal width, whichever
              comes first.  A non-positive value will disable this and
              the terminal width will be used. (default: 78)

       <b>timeout</b>

              The timeout used when a lock is held (in seconds), a
              negative value means no timeout. (default: 600)

       <b>timeout.warn</b>

              Time (in seconds) before a warning is printed about held
              lock. A negative value means no warning. (default: 0)

       <b>traceback</b>

              Mercurial always prints a traceback when an unknown
              exception occurs. Setting this to True will make Mercurial
              print a traceback on all exceptions, even those recognized
              by Mercurial (such as IOError or MemoryError). (default:
              False)

       <b>tweakdefaults</b>

          By default Mercurial's behavior changes very little from
          release to release, but over time the recommended config
          settings shift. Enable this config to opt in to get automatic
          tweaks to Mercurial's behavior over time. This config setting
          will have no effect if <b>HGPLAIN </b>is set or <b>HGPLAINEXCEPT </b>is set
          and does not include <b>tweakdefaults</b>. (default: False)

          It currently means:

          [ui]
          # The rollback command is dangerous. As a rule, don't use it.
          rollback = False
          # Make `hg status` report copy information
          statuscopies = yes
          # Prefer curses UIs when available. Revert to plain-text with `text`.
          interface = curses
          # Make compatible commands emit cwd-relative paths by default.
          relative-paths = yes

          [commands]
          # Grep working directory by default.
          grep.all-files = True
          # Refuse to perform an `hg update` that would cause a file content merge
          update.check = noconflict
          # Show conflicts information in `hg status`
          status.verbose = True
          # Make `hg resolve` with no action (like `-m`) fail instead of re-merging.
          resolve.explicit-re-merge = True

          [diff]
          git = 1
          showfunc = 1
          word-diff = 1

       <b>username</b>

              The committer of a changeset created when running
              "commit".  Typically a person's name and email address,
              e.g. <b>Fred Widget &lt;fred@example.com&gt;</b>. Environment variables
              in the username are expanded.

              (default: <b>$EMAIL </b>or <b>username@hostname</b>. If the username in
              hgrc is empty, e.g. if the system admin set <b>username = </b>in
              the system hgrc, it has to be specified manually or in a
              different hgrc file)

       <b>verbose</b>

              Increase the amount of output printed. (default: False)

   <b>command-templates</b>
       Templates used for customizing the output of commands.

       <b>graphnode</b>

              The template used to print changeset nodes in an ASCII
              revision graph.  (default: <b>{graphnode}</b>)

       <b>log</b>

              Template string for commands that print changesets.

       <b>mergemarker</b>

              The template used to print the commit description next to
              each conflict marker during merge conflicts. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>templates </b>for the template format.

              Defaults to showing the hash, tags, branches, bookmarks,
              author, and the first line of the commit description.

              If you use non-ASCII characters in names for tags,
              branches, bookmarks, authors, and/or commit descriptions,
              you must pay attention to encodings of managed files. At
              template expansion, non-ASCII characters use the encoding
              specified by the <b>--encoding </b>global option, <b>HGENCODING </b>or
              other environment variables that govern your locale. If
              the encoding of the merge markers is different from the
              encoding of the merged files, serious problems may occur.

              Can be overridden per-merge-tool, see the <b>[merge-tools]</b>
              section.

       <b>oneline-summary</b>

              A template used by <i>hg rebase</i> and other commands for
              showing a one-line summary of a commit. If the template
              configured here is longer than one line, then only the
              first line is used.

              The template can be overridden per command by defining a
              template in <i>oneline-summary.&lt;command&gt;</i>, where <i>&lt;command&gt;</i> can
              be e.g. "rebase".

       <b>pre-merge-tool-output</b>

              A template that is printed before executing an external
              merge tool. This can be used to print out additional
              context that might be useful to have during the conflict
              resolution, such as the description of the various commits
              involved or bookmarks/tags.

              Additional information is available in the <b>local`, ``base</b>,
              and <b>other </b>dicts. For example: <b>{local.label}</b>, <b>{base.name}</b>,
              or <b>{other.islink}</b>.

   <b>web</b>
       Web interface configuration. The settings in this section apply
       to both the builtin webserver (started by <b>hg serve</b>) and the
       script you run through a webserver (<b>hgweb.cgi </b>and the derivatives
       for FastCGI and WSGI).

       The Mercurial webserver does no authentication (it does not
       prompt for usernames and passwords to validate <i>who</i> users are),
       but it does do authorization (it grants or denies access for
       <i>authenticated users</i> based on settings in this section). You must
       either configure your webserver to do authentication for you, or
       disable the authorization checks.

       For a quick setup in a trusted environment, e.g., a private LAN,
       where you want it to accept pushes from anybody, you can use the
       following command line:

       $ hg --config web.allow-push=* --config web.push_ssl=False serve

       Note that this will allow anybody to push anything to the server
       and that this should not be used for public servers.

       The full set of options is:

       <b>accesslog</b>

              Where to output the access log. (default: stdout)

       <b>address</b>

              Interface address to bind to. (default: all)

       <b>allow-archive</b>

              List of archive format (bz2, gz, zip) allowed for
              downloading.  (default: empty)

       <b>allowbz2</b>

              (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.bz2 downloading of
              repository revisions.  (default: False)

       <b>allowgz</b>

              (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.gz downloading of
              repository revisions.  (default: False)

       <b>allow-pull</b>

              Whether to allow pulling from the repository. (default:
              True)

       <b>allow-push</b>

              Whether to allow pushing to the repository. If empty or
              not set, pushing is not allowed. If the special value <b>*</b>,
              any remote user can push, including unauthenticated users.
              Otherwise, the remote user must have been authenticated,
              and the authenticated user name must be present in this
              list. The contents of the allow-push list are examined
              after the deny_push list.

       <b>allow_read</b>

              If the user has not already been denied repository access
              due to the contents of deny_read, this list determines
              whether to grant repository access to the user. If this
              list is not empty, and the user is unauthenticated or not
              present in the list, then access is denied for the user.
              If the list is empty or not set, then access is permitted
              to all users by default. Setting allow_read to the special
              value <b>* </b>is equivalent to it not being set (i.e. access is
              permitted to all users). The contents of the allow_read
              list are examined after the deny_read list.

       <b>allowzip</b>

              (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .zip downloading of
              repository revisions. This feature creates temporary
              files.  (default: False)

       <b>archivesubrepos</b>

              Whether to recurse into subrepositories when archiving.
              (default: False)

       <b>baseurl</b>

              Base URL to use when publishing URLs in other locations,
              so third-party tools like email notification hooks can
              construct URLs. Example: <b><a href="http://hgserver/repos/">http://hgserver/repos/</a> </b>.

       <b>cacerts</b>

              Path to file containing a list of PEM encoded certificate
              authority certificates. Environment variables and <b>~user</b>
              constructs are expanded in the filename. If specified on
              the client, then it will verify the identity of remote
              HTTPS servers with these certificates.

              To disable SSL verification temporarily, specify
              <b>--insecure </b>from command line.

              You can use OpenSSL's CA certificate file if your platform
              has one. On most Linux systems this will be
              <b>/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</b>. Otherwise you will
              have to generate this file manually. The form must be as
              follows:

              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----

       <b>cache</b>

              Whether to support caching in hgweb. (default: True)

       <b>certificate</b>

              Certificate to use when running <b>hg serve</b>.

       <b>collapse</b>

              With <b>descend </b>enabled, repositories in subdirectories are
              shown at a single level alongside repositories in the
              current path. With <b>collapse </b>also enabled, repositories
              residing at a deeper level than the current path are
              grouped behind navigable directory entries that lead to
              the locations of these repositories. In effect, this
              setting collapses each collection of repositories found
              within a subdirectory into a single entry for that
              subdirectory. (default: False)

       <b>comparisoncontext</b>

              Number of lines of context to show in side-by-side file
              comparison. If negative or the value <b>full</b>, whole files are
              shown. (default: 5)

              This setting can be overridden by a <b>context </b>request
              parameter to the <b>comparison </b>command, taking the same
              values.

       <b>contact</b>

              Name or email address of the person in charge of the
              repository.  (default: ui.username or <b>$EMAIL </b>or "unknown"
              if unset or empty)

       <b>csp</b>

              Send a <b>Content-Security-Policy </b>HTTP header with this
              value.

              The value may contain a special string <b>%nonce%</b>, which will
              be replaced by a randomly-generated one-time use value. If
              the value contains <b>%nonce%</b>, <b>web.cache </b>will be disabled, as
              caching undermines the one-time property of the nonce.
              This nonce will also be inserted into <b>&lt;script&gt; </b>elements
              containing inline JavaScript.

              Note: lots of HTML content sent by the server is derived
              from repository data. Please consider the potential for
              malicious repository data to "inject" itself into
              generated HTML content as part of your security threat
              model.

       <b>deny_push</b>

              Whether to deny pushing to the repository. If empty or not
              set, push is not denied. If the special value <b>*</b>, all
              remote users are denied push. Otherwise, unauthenticated
              users are all denied, and any authenticated user name
              present in this list is also denied. The contents of the
              deny_push list are examined before the allow-push list.

       <b>deny_read</b>

              Whether to deny reading/viewing of the repository. If this
              list is not empty, unauthenticated users are all denied,
              and any authenticated user name present in this list is
              also denied access to the repository. If set to the
              special value <b>*</b>, all remote users are denied access
              (rarely needed ;). If deny_read is empty or not set, the
              determination of repository access depends on the presence
              and content of the allow_read list (see description). If
              both deny_read and allow_read are empty or not set, then
              access is permitted to all users by default. If the
              repository is being served via hgwebdir, denied users will
              not be able to see it in the list of repositories. The
              contents of the deny_read list have priority over (are
              examined before) the contents of the allow_read list.

       <b>descend</b>

              hgwebdir indexes will not descend into subdirectories.
              Only repositories directly in the current path will be
              shown (other repositories are still available from the
              index corresponding to their containing path).

       <b>description</b>

              Textual description of the repository's purpose or
              contents.  (default: "unknown")

       <b>encoding</b>

              Character encoding name. (default: the current locale
              charset) Example: "UTF-8".

       <b>errorlog</b>

              Where to output the error log. (default: stderr)

       <b>guessmime</b>

              Control MIME types for raw download of file content.  Set
              to True to let hgweb guess the content type from the file
              extension. This will serve HTML files as <b>text/html </b>and
              might allow cross-site scripting attacks when serving
              untrusted repositories. (default: False)

       <b>hidden</b>

              Whether to hide the repository in the hgwebdir index.
              (default: False)

       <b>ipv6</b>

              Whether to use IPv6. (default: False)

       <b>labels</b>

              List of string <i>labels</i> associated with the repository.

              Labels are exposed as a template keyword and can be used
              to customize output. e.g. the <b>index </b>template can group or
              filter repositories by labels and the <b>summary </b>template can
              display additional content if a specific label is present.

       <b>logoimg</b>

              File name of the logo image that some templates display on
              each page.  The file name is relative to <b>staticurl</b>. That
              is, the full path to the logo image is
              "staticurl/logoimg".  If unset, <b>hglogo.png </b>will be used.

       <b>logourl</b>

              Base URL to use for logos. If unset,
              <b>https://mercurial-scm.org/ </b>will be used.

       <b>maxchanges</b>

              Maximum number of changes to list on the changelog.
              (default: 10)

       <b>maxfiles</b>

              Maximum number of files to list per changeset. (default:
              10)

       <b>maxshortchanges</b>

              Maximum number of changes to list on the shortlog, graph
              or filelog pages. (default: 60)

       <b>name</b>

              Repository name to use in the web interface.  (default:
              current working directory)

       <b>port</b>

              Port to listen on. (default: 8000)

       <b>prefix</b>

              Prefix path to serve from. (default: '' (server root))

       <b>push_ssl</b>

              Whether to require that inbound pushes be transported over
              SSL to prevent password sniffing. (default: True)

       <b>refreshinterval</b>

              How frequently directory listings re-scan the filesystem
              for new repositories, in seconds. This is relevant when
              wildcards are used to define paths. Depending on how much
              filesystem traversal is required, refreshing may
              negatively impact performance.

              Values less than or equal to 0 always refresh.  (default:
              20)

       <b>server-header</b>

              Value for HTTP <b>Server </b>response header.

       <b>static</b>

              Directory where static files are served from.

       <b>staticurl</b>

              Base URL to use for static files. If unset, static files
              (e.g. the hgicon.png favicon) will be served by the CGI
              script itself. Use this setting to serve them directly
              with the HTTP server.  Example: <b><a href="http://hgserver/static/">http://hgserver/static/</a> </b>.

       <b>stripes</b>

              How many lines a "zebra stripe" should span in multi-line
              output.  Set to 0 to disable. (default: 1)

       <b>style</b>

              Which template map style to use. The available options are
              the names of subdirectories in the HTML templates path.
              (default: <b>paper</b>) Example: <b>monoblue</b>.

       <b>templates</b>

              Where to find the HTML templates. The default path to the
              HTML templates can be obtained from <b>hg debuginstall</b>.

   <b>websub</b>
       Web substitution filter definition. You can use this section to
       define a set of regular expression substitution patterns which
       let you automatically modify the hgweb server output.

       The default hgweb templates only apply these substitution
       patterns on the revision description fields. You can apply them
       anywhere you want when you create your own templates by adding
       calls to the "websub" filter (usually after calling the "escape"
       filter).

       This can be used, for example, to convert issue references to
       links to your issue tracker, or to convert "markdown-like" syntax
       into HTML (see the examples below).

       Each entry in this section names a substitution filter.  The
       value of each entry defines the substitution expression itself.
       The websub expressions follow the old interhg extension syntax,
       which in turn imitates the Unix sed replacement syntax:

       patternname = s/SEARCH_REGEX/REPLACE_EXPRESSION/[i]

       You can use any separator other than "/". The final "i" is
       optional and indicates that the search must be case insensitive.

       Examples:

       [websub]
       issues = s|issue(\d+)|&lt;a href="http://bts.example.org/issue\1"&gt;issue\1&lt;/a&gt;|i
       italic = s/\b_(\S+)_\b/&lt;i&gt;\1&lt;\/i&gt;/
       bold = s/\*\b(\S+)\b\*/&lt;b&gt;\1&lt;\/b&gt;/

   <b>worker</b>
       Parallel master/worker configuration. We currently perform
       working directory updates in parallel on Unix-like systems, which
       greatly helps performance.

       <b>enabled</b>

              Whether to enable workers code to be used.  (default:
              true)

       <b>numcpus</b>

              Number of CPUs to use for parallel operations. A zero or
              negative value is treated as <b>use the default</b>.  (default: 4
              or the number of CPUs on the system, whichever is larger)

       <b>backgroundclose</b>

              Whether to enable closing file handles on background
              threads during certain operations. Some platforms aren't
              very efficient at closing file handles that have been
              written or appended to. By performing file closing on
              background threads, file write rate can increase
              substantially.  (default: true on Windows, false
              elsewhere)

       <b>backgroundcloseminfilecount</b>

              Minimum number of files required to trigger background
              file closing.  Operations not writing this many files
              won't start background close threads.  (default: 2048)

       <b>backgroundclosemaxqueue</b>

              The maximum number of opened file handles waiting to be
              closed in the background. This option only has an effect
              if <b>backgroundclose </b>is enabled.  (default: 384)

       <b>backgroundclosethreadcount</b>

              Number of threads to process background file closes. Only
              relevant if <b>backgroundclose </b>is enabled.  (default: 4)
