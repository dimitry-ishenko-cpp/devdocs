NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-extra-override - Debian archive extra override file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>override</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       While most information about a binary/source package can be found
       in the control/.dsc file, all of it can be overridden when it's
       exported to Packages/Sources files.  The extra override file
       contains those overrides.

       The extra override file has a simple whitespace-delimited format.
       Comments are allowed (denoted with a <b>#</b>).

           <i>package field-name value</i>

       <i>package</i> is the name of the binary/source package.

       <i>field-name</i> is the name of the field that is overridden.

       <i>value</i> is the value to put in the field.  It can contain spaces as
       the line is split in no more than 3 columns when it's parsed.

       The extra override files used to make the official Packages lists
       may be found in the <i>indices</i> directory on any Debian mirror.
