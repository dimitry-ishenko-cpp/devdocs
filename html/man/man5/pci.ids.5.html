NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pci.ids - list of known identifiers related to PCI devices
</pre> <h2>
INTRODUCTION </h2>
<pre>
       Devices on the PCI bus are identified by a combination of a
       vendor ID (assigned by the PCI SIG) and device ID (assigned by
       the vendor). Both IDs are 16-bit integers and the device itself
       provides no translation to a human-readable string.

       In addition to the vendor and device, devices also report several
       other identifiers:

       •  Device class and subclass (two 8-bit numbers)

       •  Programming interface (8-bit number, meaning specific for the
          subclass)

       •  Subsystem, which identifies the assembly in which the device
          is contained.  A typical example is an Ethernet add-in card:
          the device is the Ethernet controller chip, while the card
          plays the role of the subsystem. Subsystems have their vendor
          ID (from the same namespace as device vendors) and subsystem
          ID. Generally, the meaning of the subsystem ID depends on the
          device, but there are cases in which a single subsystem ID is
          used for many devices - e.g., laptop motherboards.

          The PCI utilities use the <b>pci.ids </b>file to translate all these
          numeric IDs to strings.
</pre> <h2>
KEEPING THE LIST UP-TO-DATE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pci.ids </b>file is generated from the PCI ID database, which is
       maintained at ⟨<a href="https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/">https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/</a>⟩.  If you find any IDs
       missing from the list, please contribute them to the database.

       You can use the <b>update-pciids </b>command to download the current
       version of the list.

       Alternatively, you can use <b>lspci -q </b>to query the database online.
</pre> <h2>
FILE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The pci.ids file is a text file in plain ASCII, interpreted line
       by line.  Lines starting with the hash sign are treated as
       comments are ignored.  Comments regarding a specific entry are
       written immediately before the entry.

       Vendor entries start with a 4-digit hexadecimal vendor ID,
       followed by one or more spaces, and the name of the vendor
       extending to the end of the line.

       Device entries are placed below the vendor entry. Each device
       entry consists of a single TAB character, a 4-digit hexadecimal
       device ID, followed by one or more spaces, and the name of the
       device extending to the end of the line.

       Subsystem entries are placed below the device entry. They start
       with two TAB characters, a 4-digit hexadecimal vendor ID (which
       must be defined elsewhere in the list), a single space, a 4-digit
       hexadecimal subsystem ID, one or more spaces, and the name of the
       subsystem extending to the end of the line.

       Class entries consist of "C", one space, 2-digit hexadecimal
       class ID, one or more spaces, and the name of the class.
       Subclasses are placed below the corresponding class, indented by
       a single TAB, followed by a 2-digit hexadecimal subclass ID, one
       or more spaces, and the name of the subclass.  Programming
       interfaces are below the subclass, indented by two TABs, followed
       by a 2-digit hexadecimal prog-if ID, one or more spaces, and the
       name.

       There can be device-independent subsystem IDs, although the web
       interface of the database does not support them yet. They start
       with a subsystem vendor line consisting of "S", one space, and a
       4-digit hexadecimal vendor ID (which must correspond to an
       already listed vendor). Subsystems follow on subsequent lines,
       each indented by one TAB, followed by a 4-digit hexadecimal
       subsystem ID, one or more spaces, and the name of the subsystem.

       To ensure extensibility of the format, lines starting with an
       unrecognized letter followed by a single space are ignored and so
       are all following TAB-indented lines.
