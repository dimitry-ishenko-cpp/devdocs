NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-accesslog - Access Logging overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Access Logging overlay can be used to record all accesses to
       a given backend database on another database. This allows all of
       the activity on a given database to be reviewed using arbitrary
       LDAP queries, instead of just logging to local flat text files.
       Configuration options are available for selecting a subset of
       operation types to log, and to automatically prune older log
       records from the logging database.  Log records are stored with
       audit schema (see below) to assure their readability whether
       viewed as LDIF or in raw form.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf </b>options apply to the Access Logging overlay.
       They should appear after the <b>overlay </b>directive.

       <b>logdb &lt;suffix&gt;</b>
              Specify the suffix of a database to be used for storing
              the log records.  The specified database must be defined
              elsewhere in the configuration and must support an ordered
              return of results such as <a href="slapd-mdb.5.html">slapd-mdb(5)</a> The access controls
              on the log database should prevent general access. The
              suffix entry of the log database will be created
              automatically by this overlay. The log entries will be
              generated as the immediate children of the suffix entry.

       <b>logops &lt;operations&gt;</b>
              Specify which types of operations to log. The valid
              operation types are abandon, add, bind, compare, delete,
              extended, modify, modrdn, search, and unbind. Aliases for
              common sets of operations are also available:

              <b>writes </b>add, delete, modify, modrdn

              <b>reads  </b>compare, search

              <b>session</b>
                     abandon, bind, unbind

              <b>all    </b>all operations

       <b>logbase &lt;operations&gt; &lt;baseDN&gt;</b>
              Specify a set of operations that will only be logged if
              they occur under a specific subtree of the database. The
              operation types are as above for the <b>logops </b>setting, and
              delimited by a '|' character.

       <b>logold &lt;filter&gt;</b>
              Specify a filter for matching against Deleted and Modified
              entries. If the entry matches the filter, the old contents
              of the entry will be logged along with the current
              request.

       <b>logoldattr &lt;attr&gt; ...</b>
              Specify a list of attributes whose old contents are always
              logged in Modify and ModRDN requests that match any of the
              filters configured in <b>logold</b>.  Usually only the contents
              of attributes that were actually modified will be logged;
              by default no old attributes are logged for ModRDN
              requests.

       <b>logpurge &lt;age&gt; &lt;interval&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum age for log entries to be retained in
              the database, and how often to scan the database for old
              entries. Both the <b>age </b>and <b>interval </b>are specified as a time
              span in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The time format
              is [ddd+]hh:mm[:ss] i.e., the days and seconds components
              are optional but hours and minutes are required. Except
              for days, which can be up to 5 digits, each numeric field
              must be exactly two digits. For example
                     logpurge 2+00:00 1+00:00
              would specify that the log database should be scanned
              every day for old entries, and entries older than two days
              should be deleted. When using a log database that supports
              ordered indexing on generalizedTime attributes, specifying
              an eq index on the <b>reqStart </b>attribute will greatly benefit
              the performance of the purge operation.

       <b>logsuccess TRUE | FALSE</b>
              If set to TRUE then log records will only be generated for
              successful requests, i.e., requests that produce a result
              code of 0 (LDAP_SUCCESS).  If FALSE, log records are
              generated for all requests whether they succeed or not.
              The default is FALSE.

</pre> <h2>
SCHEMA </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>accesslog </b>overlay utilizes the "audit" schema described
       herein.  This schema is specifically designed for <b>accesslog</b>
       auditing and is not intended to be used otherwise.  It is also
       noted that the schema described here is <i>a work in progress</i>, and
       hence subject to change without notice.  The schema is loaded
       automatically by the overlay.

       The schema includes a number of object classes and associated
       attribute types as described below.

       The root entry of the underlying accesslog database makes use of
       the <b>auditContainer </b>class which is as follows:

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.0
               NAME 'auditContainer'
               DESC 'AuditLog container'
               SUP top STRUCTURAL
               MAY ( cn $ reqStart $ reqEnd ) )

       There is a basic <b>auditObject </b>class from which two additional
       classes, <b>auditReadObject </b>and <b>auditWriteObject </b>are derived. Object
       classes for each type of LDAP operation are further derived from
       these classes. This object class hierarchy is designed to allow
       flexible yet efficient searches of the log based on either a
       specific operation type's class, or on more general
       classifications. The definition of the <b>auditObject </b>class is as
       follows:

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.1
               NAME 'auditObject'
               DESC 'OpenLDAP request auditing'
               SUP top STRUCTURAL
               MUST ( reqStart $ reqType $ reqSession )
               MAY ( reqDN $ reqAuthzID $ reqControls $ reqRespControls
           $
                   reqEnd $ reqResult $ reqMessage $ reqReferral $
           reqEntryUUID ) )

       Note that all of the OIDs used in the logging schema currently
       reside under the OpenLDAP Experimental branch. It is anticipated
       that they will migrate to a Standard branch in the future.

       An overview of the attributes follows: <b>reqStart </b>and <b>reqEnd</b>
       provide the start and end time of the operation, respectively.
       They use generalizedTime syntax. The <b>reqStart </b>attribute is also
       used as the RDN for each log entry.

       The <b>reqType </b>attribute is a simple string containing the type of
       operation being logged, e.g.  <b>add</b>, <b>delete</b>, <b>search</b>, etc. For
       extended operations, the type also includes the OID of the
       extended operation, e.g.  <b>extended(1.1.1.1)</b>

       The <b>reqSession </b>attribute is an implementation-specific identifier
       that is common to all the operations associated with the same
       LDAP session. Currently this is slapd's internal connection ID,
       stored in decimal.

       The <b>reqDN </b>attribute is the distinguishedName of the target of the
       operation. E.g., for a Bind request, this is the Bind DN. For an
       Add request, this is the DN of the entry being added. For a
       Search request, this is the base DN of the search.

       The <b>reqAuthzID </b>attribute is the distinguishedName of the user
       that performed the operation.  This will usually be the same name
       as was established at the start of a session by a Bind request
       (if any) but may be altered in various circumstances.

       The <b>reqControls </b>and <b>reqRespControls </b>attributes carry any controls
       sent by the client on the request and returned by the server in
       the response, respectively. The attribute values are just
       uninterpreted octet strings.

       The <b>reqResult </b>attribute is the numeric LDAP result code of the
       operation, indicating either success or a particular LDAP error
       code. An error code may be accompanied by a text error message
       which will be recorded in the <b>reqMessage </b>attribute.

       The <b>reqReferral </b>attribute carries any referrals that were
       returned with the result of the request.

       The <b>reqEntryUUID </b>attribute records the entryUUID attribute of the
       entry operated on, for an Add request, this is the entryUUID of
       the newly created entry.

       Operation-specific classes are defined with additional attributes
       to carry all of the relevant parameters associated with the
       operation:

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.4
               NAME 'auditAbandon'
               DESC 'Abandon operation'
               SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL
               MUST reqId )

       For the <b>Abandon </b>operation the <b>reqId </b>attribute contains the
       message ID of the request that was abandoned.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.5
               NAME 'auditAdd'
               DESC 'Add operation'
               SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL
               MUST reqMod )

       The <b>Add </b>class inherits from the <b>auditWriteObject </b>class. The Add
       and Modify classes are very similar. The <b>reqMod </b>attribute carries
       all of the attributes of the original entry being added.  (Or in
       the case of a Modify operation, all of the modifications being
       performed.) The values are formatted as
              attribute:&lt;+|-|=|#&gt; [ value]
       Where '+' indicates an Add of a value, '-' for Delete, '=' for
       Replace, and '#' for Increment. In an Add operation, all of the
       reqMod values will have the '+' designator.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.6
               NAME 'auditBind'
               DESC 'Bind operation'
               SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL
               MUST ( reqVersion $ reqMethod ) )

       The <b>Bind </b>class includes the <b>reqVersion </b>attribute which contains
       the LDAP protocol version specified in the Bind as well as the
       <b>reqMethod </b>attribute which contains the Bind Method used in the
       Bind. This will be the string <b>SIMPLE </b>for LDAP Simple Binds or
       <b>SASL(&lt;mech&gt;) </b>for SASL Binds.  Note that unless configured as a
       global overlay, only Simple Binds using DNs that reside in the
       current database will be logged.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.7
               NAME 'auditCompare'
               DESC 'Compare operation'
               SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL
               MUST reqAssertion )

       For the <b>Compare </b>operation the <b>reqAssertion </b>attribute carries the
       Attribute Value Assertion used in the compare request.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.8
               NAME 'auditDelete'
               DESC 'Delete operation'
               SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL
               MAY reqOld )

       The <b>Delete </b>operation needs no further parameters. However, the
       <b>reqOld </b>attribute may optionally be used to record the contents of
       the entry prior to its deletion. The values are formatted as
              attribute: value
       The <b>reqOld </b>attribute is only populated if the entry being deleted
       matches the configured <b>logold </b>filter.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.9
               NAME 'auditModify'
               DESC 'Modify operation'
               SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL
               MAY ( reqOld $ reqMod ) )

       The <b>Modify </b>operation contains a description of modifications in
       the <b>reqMod </b>attribute, which was already described above in the
       Add operation. It may optionally contain the previous contents of
       any modified attributes in the <b>reqOld </b>attribute, using the same
       format as described above for the Delete operation.  The <b>reqOld</b>
       attribute is only populated if the entry being modified matches
       the configured <b>logold </b>filter.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.10
               NAME 'auditModRDN'
               DESC 'ModRDN operation'
               SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL
               MUST ( reqNewRDN $ reqDeleteOldRDN )
               MAY ( reqNewSuperior $ reqMod $ reqOld ) )

       The <b>ModRDN </b>class uses the <b>reqNewRDN </b>attribute to carry the new
       RDN of the request.  The <b>reqDeleteOldRDN </b>attribute is a Boolean
       value showing <b>TRUE </b>if the old RDN was deleted from the entry, or
       <b>FALSE </b>if the old RDN was preserved.  The <b>reqNewSuperior </b>attribute
       carries the DN of the new parent entry if the request specified
       the new parent.  The <b>reqOld </b>attribute is only populated if the
       entry being modified matches the configured <b>logold </b>filter and
       contains attributes in the <b>logoldattr </b>list.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.11
               NAME 'auditSearch'
               DESC 'Search operation'
               SUP auditReadObject STRUCTURAL
               MUST ( reqScope $ reqDerefAliases $ reqAttrsOnly )
               MAY ( reqFilter $ reqAttr $ reqEntries $ reqSizeLimit $
                     reqTimeLimit ) )

       For the <b>Search </b>class the <b>reqScope </b>attribute contains the scope of
       the original search request, using the values specified for the
       LDAP URL format. I.e.  <b>base</b>, <b>one</b>, <b>sub</b>, or <b>subord</b>.  The
       <b>reqDerefAliases </b>attribute is one of <b>never</b>, <b>finding</b>, <b>searching</b>, or
       <b>always</b>, denoting how aliases will be processed during the search.
       The <b>reqAttrsOnly </b>attribute is a Boolean value showing <b>TRUE </b>if
       only attribute names were requested, or <b>FALSE </b>if attributes and
       their values were requested.  The <b>reqFilter </b>attribute carries the
       filter used in the search request.  The <b>reqAttr </b>attribute lists
       the requested attributes if specific attributes were requested.
       The <b>reqEntries </b>attribute is the integer count of how many entries
       were returned by this search request.  The <b>reqSizeLimit </b>and
       <b>reqTimeLimit </b>attributes indicate what limits were requested on
       the search operation.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.12
               NAME 'auditExtended'
               DESC 'Extended operation'
               SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL
               MAY reqData )

       The <b>Extended </b>class represents an LDAP Extended Operation. As
       noted above, the actual OID of the operation is included in the
       <b>reqType </b>attribute of the parent class. If any optional data was
       provided with the request, it will be contained in the <b>reqData</b>
       attribute as an uninterpreted octet string.
