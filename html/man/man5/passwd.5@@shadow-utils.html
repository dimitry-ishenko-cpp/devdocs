</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       passwd - the password file
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/passwd contains one line for each user account, with seven
       fields delimited by colons (“:”). These fields are:

       •   login name

       •   optional encrypted password

       •   numerical user ID

       •   numerical group ID

       •   user name or comment field

       •   user home directory

       •   optional user command interpreter

       If the <i>password</i> field is a lower-case “x”, then the encrypted
       password is actually stored in the <a href="shadow.5.html">shadow(5)</a> file instead; there
       <i>must</i> be a corresponding line in the /etc/shadow file, or else the
       user account is invalid.

       The encrypted <i>password</i> field may be empty, in which case no
       password is required to authenticate as the specified login name.
       However, some applications which read the /etc/passwd file may
       decide not to permit <i>any</i> access at all if the <i>password</i> field is
       blank.

       A <i>password</i> field which starts with an exclamation mark means that
       the password is locked. The remaining characters on the line
       represent the <i>password</i> field before the password was locked.

       Refer to <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a> for details on how this string is interpreted.

       If the password field contains some string that is not a valid
       result of <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</a>, for instance ! or *, the user will not be
       able to use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in
       the system by other means).

       The comment field, also known as the gecos field, is used by
       various system utilities, such as <b>finger</b>(1). The use of an
       ampersand here will be replaced by the capitalised login name
       when the field is used or displayed by such system utilities.

       The home directory field provides the name of the initial working
       directory. The <b>login </b>program uses this information to set the
       value of the <b>$HOME </b>environmental variable.

       The command interpreter field provides the name of the user's
       command language interpreter, or the name of the initial program
       to execute. The <b>login </b>program uses this information to set the
       value of the <b>$SHELL </b>environmental variable. If this field is
       empty, it defaults to the value /bin/sh.
