DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The DNSSEC trust anchor configuration files define positive and
       negative trust anchors <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a> bases DNSSEC
       integrity proofs on.
</pre> <h2>
POSITIVE TRUST ANCHORS </h2>
<pre>
       Positive trust anchor configuration files contain <b>DNSKEY </b>and <b>DS</b>
       resource record definitions to use as base for DNSSEC integrity
       proofs. See <b>RFC 4035, Section 4.4</b>[1] for more information about
       DNSSEC trust anchors.

       Positive trust anchors are read from files with the suffix
       .positive located in /etc/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/,
       /run/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/ and
       /usr/lib/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/. These directories are searched
       in the specified order, and a trust anchor file of the same name
       in an earlier path overrides a trust anchor files in a later
       path. To disable a trust anchor file shipped in
       /usr/lib/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/ it is sufficient to provide an
       identically-named file in /etc/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/ or
       /run/dnssec-trust-anchors.d/ that is either empty or a symlink to
       /dev/null ("masked").

       Positive trust anchor files are simple text files resembling DNS
       zone files, as documented in <b>RFC 1035, Section 5</b>[2]. One <b>DS </b>or
       <b>DNSKEY </b>resource record may be listed per line. Empty lines and
       lines starting with "#" or ";" are ignored, which may be used for
       commenting. A <b>DS </b>resource record is specified like in the
       following example:

           . IN DS 19036 8 2 49aac11d7b6f6446702e54a1607371607a1a41855200fd2ce1cdde32f24e8fb5

       The first word specifies the domain, use "."  for the root
       domain. The domain may be specified with or without trailing dot,
       which is considered equivalent. The second word must be "IN" the
       third word "DS". The following words specify the key tag,
       signature algorithm, digest algorithm, followed by the
       hex-encoded key fingerprint. See <b>RFC 4034, Section 5</b>[3] for
       details about the precise syntax and meaning of these fields.

       Alternatively, <b>DNSKEY </b>resource records may be used to define
       trust anchors, like in the following example:

           . IN DNSKEY 257 3 8 AwEAAagAIKlVZrpC6Ia7gEzahOR+9W29euxhJhVVLOyQbSEW0O8gcCjFFVQUTf6v58fLjwBd0YI0EzrAcQqBGCzh/RStIoO8g0NfnfL2MTJRkxoXbfDaUeVPQuYEhg37NZWAJQ9VnMVDxP/VHL496M/QZxkjf5/Efucp2gaDX6RS6CXpoY68LsvPVjR0ZSwzz1apAzvN9dlzEheX7ICJBBtuA6G3LQpzW5hOA2hzCTMjJPJ8LbqF6dsV6DoBQzgul0sGIcGOYl7OyQdXfZ57relSQageu+ipAdTTJ25AsRTAoub8ONGcLmqrAmRLKBP1dfwhYB4N7knNnulqQxA+Uk1ihz0=

       The first word specifies the domain again, the second word must
       be "IN", followed by "DNSKEY". The subsequent words encode the
       <b>DNSKEY </b>flags, protocol and algorithm fields, followed by the key
       data encoded in Base64. See <b>RFC 4034, Section 2</b>[4] for details
       about the precise syntax and meaning of these fields.

       If multiple <b>DS </b>or <b>DNSKEY </b>records are defined for the same domain
       (possibly even in different trust anchor files), all keys are
       used and are considered equivalent as base for DNSSEC proofs.

       Note that systemd-resolved will automatically use a built-in
       trust anchor key for the Internet root domain if no positive
       trust anchors are defined for the root domain. In most cases it
       is hence unnecessary to define an explicit key with trust anchor
       files. The built-in key is disabled as soon as at least one trust
       anchor key for the root domain is defined in trust anchor files.

       It is generally recommended to encode trust anchors in <b>DS</b>
       resource records, rather than <b>DNSKEY </b>resource records.

       If a trust anchor specified via a <b>DS </b>record is found revoked it
       is automatically removed from the trust anchor database for the
       runtime. See <b>RFC 5011</b>[5] for details about revoked trust anchors.
       Note that systemd-resolved will not update its trust anchor
       database from DNS servers automatically. Instead, it is
       recommended to update the resolver software or update the new
       trust anchor via adding in new trust anchor files.

       The current DNSSEC trust anchor for the Internet's root domain is
       available at the <b>IANA Trust Anchor and Keys</b>[6] page.
</pre> <h2>
NEGATIVE TRUST ANCHORS </h2>
<pre>
       Negative trust anchors define domains where DNSSEC validation
       shall be turned off. Negative trust anchor files are found at the
       same location as positive trust anchor files, and follow the same
       overriding rules. They are text files with the .negative suffix.
       Empty lines and lines whose first character is ";" are ignored.
       Each line specifies one domain name which is the root of a DNS
       subtree where validation shall be disabled. For example:

           # Reverse IPv4 mappings
           10.in-addr.arpa
           16.172.in-addr.arpa
           168.192.in-addr.arpa
           ...
           # Some custom domains
           prod
           stag

       Negative trust anchors are useful to support private DNS subtrees
       that are not referenced from the Internet DNS hierarchy, and not
       signed.

       <b>RFC 7646</b>[7] for details on negative trust anchors.

       If no negative trust anchor files are configured a built-in set
       of well-known private DNS zone domains is used as negative trust
       anchors.

       It is also possibly to define per-interface negative trust
       anchors using the <i>DNSSECNegativeTrustAnchors=</i> setting in
       <a href="systemd.network.5.html">systemd.network(5)</a> files.
