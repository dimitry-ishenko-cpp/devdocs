</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-shlibs - Debian shared library information file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debian/shlibs</b>, <b>debian/</b><i>binary-name</i><b>.shlibs</b>, <b>DEBIAN/shlibs</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>shlibs </b>files map shared library names and versions (<i>SONAMEs</i>) to
       dependencies suitable for a package control file.  There is one
       entry per line.  Blank lines are <b>not </b>allowed.  Lines beginning
       with a <b># </b>character are considered commentary, and are ignored.
       All other lines must have the format:

           [<i>type</i><b>:</b>] <i>library version dependencies</i>

       The <i>library</i> and <i>version</i> fields are whitespace-delimited, but the
       <i>dependencies</i> field extends to the end of the line.  The <i>type</i>
       field is optional and normally not needed.

       The <i>dependencies</i> field has the same syntax as the <b>Depends </b>field
       in a binary control file, see <a href="deb-control.5.html">deb-control(5)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
SONAME FORMATS </h2>
<pre>
       The SONAME formats supported are:

           <i>name</i>.so.<i>version</i>

       and

           <i>name</i>-<i>version</i>.so

       where <i>name</i> is usually prefixed by <b>lib</b>.

       The former tends to be used by shared libraries with stable
       interfaces.  The latter by shared libraries with unstable
       interfaces, where the whole version becomes part of the SONAME
       and needs to be specified in full when linking against those
       libraries.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>shlibs </b>file for a typical library package, named <i>libcrunch1</i>,
       that provides one library whose SONAME is <i>libcrunch.so.1</i>, might
       read

        libcrunch 1 libcrunch1 (&gt;= 1.2-1)

       The <i>dependencies</i> must mention the most recent version of the
       package that added new symbols to the library: in the above
       example, new symbols were added to version 1.2 of <i>libcrunch</i>.
       This is not the only reason the dependencies might need to be
       tightened.
