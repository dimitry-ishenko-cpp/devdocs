NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>perfevent.conf </b>- the Performance Co-Pilot perfevent PMDA
       configuration file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perfevent.conf</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The perfevent.conf configuration file defines which hardware
       performance counters are enabled by the perfevent PMDA.

       The configuration file contains a list of events that should be
       enabled for each PMU. The perfevent PMDA detects which PMUs
       present and programs the configured events. If multiple PMUs are
       available, the perfevent PMDA uses the order of the entries in
       the configuration file to determine which PMU settings to use.
       The entries at the top of the configuration file have higher
       precedence.  Only one PMU configuration setting is used. The
       configuration file may also contain perf derived events. A
       derived event has a list of events which must be listed as base
       events. The values for the counters in the derived events are
       aggregated and displayed.
</pre> <h2>
FILE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The file consists of one or more groups of PMUs and the events
       that go with them.

       The PMU identification string is enclosed in brackets and one or
       more events are listed below, one per line.

              <b>["PMU identification string"]</b>
              <b>EVENT_NAME [CPU OPTION]</b>
              <b>...</b>

       For derived events, one or more groups of events can be specified
       where, counters in one group can be specific to one architecture
       and the counters in other group can be specific to some other
       architecture. Else, only one group can be specified.
       EVENT_NAME_1, EVENT_NAME_2 etc. belong to group 1 and
       EVENT_NAME_3, EVENT_NAME_4 belong to group 2 and so on. If any of
       the event in the first group is not available, entire group will
       be discarded. And, the next group will be checked. The first
       group with all the events available will be activated and
       monitored. The derived perf event is enclosed in brackets along
       with :derived as a suffix. Note that the EVENT_NAME listed under
       derived event must be present as a base event in the
       configuration file. And, all the events under a particular
       derived perf event group must have the same CPU_OPTION. || acts
       as a separator for different groups inside a single derived
       event. The syntax is :

              <b>[event:derived]</b>
              <b>EVENT_NAME_1 [CPU_OPTION] [scale]</b>
              <b>EVENT_NAME_2 [CPU_OPTION] [scale]</b>
              <b>...</b>
              <b>||</b>
              <b>EVENT_NAME_3 [CPU_OPTION] [scale]</b>
              <b>EVENT_NAME_4 [CPU_OPTION] [scale]</b>
              <b>...</b>

              The available event cpu options are as follows:

              <b>cpu    </b>to add the counter to all cpus in the system

              <b>cpu_rr </b>to add to one of the cpus in a round-robin
                     allocation strategy

              <b>node   </b>to add the counter to the first cpu in each numa
                     node

              <b>node_rr</b>
                     to add the counter to the cpus in each numa node in
                     a round-robin allocation strategy

              <b>[N]    </b>where N is the numerical digit of the CPU index

              if the CPU option is absent then the event is programmed
              on all cpus.

              <b>scale </b>is applicable for the counters in derived events. If
              scale is given, the counters will be scaled to their
              respective values. The options are as follows :

              <b>a float value</b>
                     Can be a simple float value, or a value in
                     scientific notation.

              <b>perf_scale</b>
                     The scale will be taken from the kernel sysfs scale
                     file entry for that event. Its generally specified
                     in
                     <b>/sys/bus/event_source/device/events/&lt;event_name&gt;.scale</b>

              If no scale is given, the default scale will be taken as
              1.0.

              Blank lines are ignored. Lines that begin with the # sign
              are ignored.

              Multiple, comma separated, PMUs may be specified in the
              PMU definition.
