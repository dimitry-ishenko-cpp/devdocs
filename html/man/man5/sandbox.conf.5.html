NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sandbox.conf - user config file for the SELinux sandbox
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       When running sandbox with the -C argument, it will be confined
       using control groups and a system administrator can specify how
       the sandbox is confined.

       Everything after "#" is ignored, as are empty lines.  All
       arguments should be separated by and equals sign ("=").

       These keywords are allowed.

              <b>NAME   </b>The name of the sandbox control group.  Default is
                     "sandbox".

              <b>CPUAFFINITY</b>
                     Which cpus to assign sandbox to.  The default is
                     ALL, but users can specify a comma-separated list
                     with dashes ("-") to represent ranges.  Ex: 0-2,5

              <b>MEMUSAGE</b>
                     How much memory to allow sandbox to use.  The
                     default is 80%.  Users can specify either a
                     percentage or a value in the form of a number
                     followed by one of the suffixes K, M, G to denote
                     kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively.
                     Ex: 50% or 100M

              <b>CPUUSAGE</b>
                     Percentage of cpu sandbox should be allowed to use.
                     The default is 80%.  Specify a value followed by a
                     percent sign ("%"). Ex: 50%
