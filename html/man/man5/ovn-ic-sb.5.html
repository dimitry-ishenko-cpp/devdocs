       ovn-ic-sb - OVN_IC_Southbound database schema

       This database holds configuration and state for interconnecting
       different OVN deployments. The content of the database is
       populated and used by the <b>ovn-ic </b>program in each OVN deployment,
       and not supposed to be directly used by CMS or end user.

       The OVN Interconnection Southbound database is shared by <b>ovn-ic</b>
       program in each OVN deployment. It contains interconnection
       information from all related OVN deployments, and is used as the
       intermediate store for each OVN deployment to exchange the
       information. The <b>ovn-ic </b>program in each deployment is responsible
       for syncing the data between this database and the its own
       northbound and southbound databases.

   <b>Database Structure</b>
       The OVN Interconnection Southbound database contains classes of
       data with different properties, as described in the sections
       below.

     <i>Availability Zone Specific Information</i>

       These tables contain objects that are availability zone specific.
       Each object is owned and populated by one availability zone, and
       read by other availability zones.

       The <b>Availability_Zone</b>, <b>Gateway</b>, <b>Encap </b>and <b>Port_Binding </b>tables are
       the availability zone specific tables.

     <i>Global Information</i>

       The data that does not belong to any specific availability zone
       but is common for all availability zones.

       The <b>Datapath_Binding </b>table contains the common datapath binding
       information.

     <i>Common Columns</i>

       Each of the tables in this database contains a special column,
       named <b>external_ids</b>. This column has the same form and purpose
       each place it appears.

              <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for use by <b>ovn-ic</b>.

                     used, this configuration can be specified via
                     command-line options or the <b>SSL </b>table.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not

              <b>tcp:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified TCP <i>port</i> on the given <i>host</i>, which can
                     either be a DNS name (if built with unbound
                     library) or an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6). If <i>host</i>
                     is an IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets,
                     e.g. <b>tcp:[::1]:6640</b>.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              <b>pssl:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for SSL connections on the specified TCP
                     <i>port</i>. Specify 0 for <i>port</i> to have the kernel
                     automatically choose an available port. If <i>host</i>,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address, is specified,
                     then connections are restricted to the resolved or
                     specified local IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6
                     address). If <i>host</i> is an IPv6 address, wrap in
                     square brackets, e.g. <b>pssl:6640:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is
                     not specified then it listens only on IPv4 (but not
                     IPv6) addresses. A valid SSL configuration must be
                     provided when this form is used, this can be
                     specified either via command-line options or the

              <b>ptcp:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for connections on the specified TCP <i>port</i>.
                     Specify 0 for <i>port</i> to have the kernel automatically
                     choose an available port. If <i>host</i>, which can either
                     be a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or an
                     IP address, is specified, then connections are
                     restricted to the resolved or specified local IP
                     address (either IPv4 or IPv6 address). If <i>host</i> is
                     an IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g.
                     <b>ptcp:6640:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is not specified then it
                     listens only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              When multiple clients are configured, the <b>target </b>values
              must be unique. Duplicate <b>target </b>values yield unspecified
              results.

     <i>Client Failure Detection and Handling:</i>

       <b>max_backoff</b>: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection
              attempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       <b>inactivity_probe</b>: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection
              to the client before sending an inactivity probe message.
              If Open vSwitch does not communicate with the client for
              the specified number of seconds, it will send a probe. If
              a response is not received for the same additional amount
              of time, Open vSwitch assumes the connection has been
              broken and attempts to reconnect. Default is
              implementation-specific. A value of 0 disables inactivity
              probes.

     <i>Status:</i>

       Key-value pair of <b>is_connected </b>is always updated. Other key-value
       pairs in the status columns may be updated depends on the <b>target</b>
       type.

       When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
       inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>punix:</b>), both <b>n_connections</b>
       and <b>is_connected </b>may also be updated while the remaining key-
       value pairs are omitted.

       On the other hand, when <b>target </b>specifies an outbound connection,
       all key-value pairs may be updated, except the above-mentioned
       two key-value pairs associated with inbound connection targets.
       They are omitted.

       <b>is_connected</b>: boolean
              <b>true </b>if currently connected to this client, <b>false</b>
              otherwise.

       <b>status : last_error</b>: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the
              connection to the manager; i.e. <b>strerror(errno)</b>. This key
              will exist only if an error has occurred.

       <b>status : state</b>: optional string, one of <b>ACTIVE</b>, <b>BACKOFF</b>,
       <b>CONNECTING</b>, <b>IDLE</b>, or <b>VOID</b>
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              <b>VOID   </b>Connection is disabled.

              <b>BACKOFF</b>
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              <b>CONNECTING</b>
                     Attempting to connect.

              <b>ACTIVE </b>Connected, remote host responsive.

              <b>IDLE   </b>Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-
                     alive.

              These values may change in the future. They are provided
              only for human consumption.

       <b>status : sec_since_connect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last successfully
              connected to the database (in seconds). Value is empty if
              client has never successfully been connected.

       <b>status : sec_since_disconnect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last disconnected
              from the database (in seconds). Value is empty if client
              has never disconnected.

       <b>status : locks_held</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection holds. Omitted if the connection does not hold
              any locks.

       <b>status : locks_waiting</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection is currently waiting to acquire. Omitted if the
              connection is not waiting for any locks.

       <b>status : locks_lost</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection has had stolen by another OVSDB client. Omitted
              if no locks have been stolen from this connection.

       <b>status : n_connections</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 2
              When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
              inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>) and more than
              one connection is actually active, the value is the number
              of active connections. Otherwise, this key-value pair is
              omitted.

       <b>status : bound_port</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              When <b>target </b>is <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>, this is the TCP port on
              which the OVSDB server is listening. (This is particularly
              useful when <b>target </b>specifies a port of 0, allowing the
              kernel to choose any available port.)

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>private_key</b>: string
              Name of a PEM file containing the private key used as the
              switch’s identity for SSL connections to the controller.

       <b>certificate</b>: string
              Name of a PEM file containing a certificate, signed by the
              certificate authority (CA) used by the controller and
              manager, that certifies the switch’s private key,
              identifying a trustworthy switch.

       <b>ca_cert</b>: string
              Name of a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to
              verify that the switch is connected to a trustworthy
              controller.

       <b>bootstrap_ca_cert</b>: boolean
              If set to <b>true</b>, then Open vSwitch will attempt to obtain
              the CA certificate from the controller on its first SSL
              connection and save it to the named PEM file. If it is
              successful, it will immediately drop the connection and
              reconnect, and from then on all SSL connections must be
              authenticated by a certificate signed by the CA
              certificate thus obtained. <b>This option exposes the SSL</b>
              <b>connection to a man-in-the-middle attack obtaining the</b>
              <b>initial CA certificate. </b>It may still be useful for
              bootstrapping.

       <b>ssl_protocols</b>: string
              List of SSL protocols to be enabled for SSL connections.
              The default when this option is omitted is
