DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/io</i> (since Linux 2.6.20)
              This file contains I/O statistics for the process and its
              waited-for children, for example:

                  # <b>cat /proc/3828/io</b>
                  rchar: 323934931
                  wchar: 323929600
                  syscr: 632687
                  syscw: 632675
                  read_bytes: 0
                  write_bytes: 323932160
                  cancelled_write_bytes: 0

              The fields are as follows:

              <i>rchar</i>: characters read
                     The number of bytes returned by successful <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>
                     and similar system calls.

              <i>wchar</i>: characters written
                     The number of bytes returned by successful <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>
                     and similar system calls.

              <i>syscr</i>: read syscalls
                     The number of "file read" system calls—those from
                     the <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> family, <a href="../man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile(2)</a>,
                     <a href="../man2/copy_file_range.2.html">copy_file_range(2)</a>, and <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>
                     <b>BTRFS_IOC_ENCODED_READ</b>[<b>_32</b>] (including when invoked
                     by the kernel as part of other syscalls).

              <i>syscw</i>: write syscalls
                     The number of "file write" system calls—those from
                     the <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> family, <a href="../man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile(2)</a>,
                     <a href="../man2/copy_file_range.2.html">copy_file_range(2)</a>, and <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>
                     <b>BTRFS_IOC_ENCODED_WRITE</b>[<b>_32</b>] (including when
                     invoked by the kernel as part of other syscalls).

              <i>read_bytes</i>: bytes read
                     The number of bytes really fetched from the storage
                     layer.  This is accurate for block-backed
                     filesystems.

              <i>write_bytes</i>: bytes written
                     The number of bytes really sent to the storage
                     layer.

              <i>cancelled_write_bytes</i>:
                     The above statistics fail to account for
                     truncation: if a process writes 1 MB to a regular
                     file and then removes it, said 1 MB will not be
                     written, but <i>will</i> have nevertheless been accounted
                     as a 1 MB write.  This field represents the number
                     of bytes "saved" from I/O writeback.  This can
                     yield to having done negative I/O if caches dirtied
                     by another process are truncated.
                     <i>cancelled_write_bytes</i> applies to I/O already
                     accounted-for in <i>write_bytes</i>.

CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       These counters are not atomic: on systems where 64-bit integer
       operations may tear, a counter could be updated simultaneously
       with a read, yielding an incorrect intermediate value.
