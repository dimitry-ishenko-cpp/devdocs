NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapd-sock - Socket backend/overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Socket backend to <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> uses an external program to handle
       queries that listens on a Unix domain socket.  This makes it
       possible to have a pool of processes, which persist between
       requests. This allows multithreaded operation and a high level of
       efficiency. The external program must have been started
       independently; <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> itself will not start it.

       This module may also be used as an overlay on top of some other
       database.  Use as an overlay allows external actions to be
       triggered in response to operations on the main database.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf </b>options apply to the SOCK backend database.
       That is, they must follow a "database sock" line and come before
       any subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database
       options are described in the <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> manual page.

       Alternatively, to use this module as an overlay, these directives
       must follow an "overlay sock" line within an existing database
       definition.

       <b>extensions [ binddn | peername | ssf | connid ]*</b>
              Enables the sending of additional meta-attributes with
              each request.
              binddn: &lt;bound DN&gt;
              peername: IP=&lt;address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
              ssf: &lt;SSF value&gt;
              connid: &lt;connection ID&gt;

       <b>socketpath &lt;pathname&gt;</b>
              Gives the path to a Unix domain socket to which the
              commands will be sent and from which replies are received.

              When used as an overlay, these additional directives are
              defined:

       <b>sockops   [ bind | unbind | search | compare | modify | modrdn |</b>
       <b>add | delete | extended ]*</b>
              Specify which request types to send to the external
              program. The default is empty (no requests are sent).

       <b>sockresps [ result | search ]*</b>
              Specify which response types to send to the external
              program. "result" sends just the results of an operation.
              "search" sends all entries that the database returned for
              a search request. The default is empty (no responses are
              sent).

       <b>sockdnpat &lt;regexp&gt;</b>
              Specify DN patterns for which the overlay will act. Only
              operations on DNs matching the specified regular
              expression will be processed. The default is empty (all
              DNs are processed).
</pre> <h2>
PROTOCOL </h2>
<pre>
       The protocol uses a newline to terminate the command parameters.
       The following commands are sent:
              ADD
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              &lt;repeat { "suffix:" &lt;database suffix DN&gt; }&gt;
              &lt;entry in LDIF format&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;

              BIND
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              &lt;repeat { "suffix:" &lt;database suffix DN&gt; }&gt;
              dn: &lt;DN&gt;
              method: &lt;method number&gt;
              credlen: &lt;length of &lt;credentials&gt;&gt;
              cred: &lt;credentials&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;

              COMPARE
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              &lt;repeat { "suffix:" &lt;database suffix DN&gt; }&gt;
              dn: &lt;DN&gt;
              &lt;attribute&gt;: &lt;value&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;

              DELETE
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              &lt;repeat { "suffix:" &lt;database suffix DN&gt; }&gt;
              dn: &lt;DN&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;

              EXTENDED
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              &lt;repeat { "suffix:" &lt;database suffix DN&gt; }&gt;
              oid: &lt;OID&gt;
              value: &lt;base64-value&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;

              MODIFY
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              &lt;repeat { "suffix:" &lt;database suffix DN&gt; }&gt;
              dn: &lt;DN&gt;
              &lt;repeat {
                  &lt;"add"/"delete"/"replace"&gt;: &lt;attribute&gt;
                  &lt;repeat { &lt;attribute&gt;: &lt;value&gt; }&gt;
                  -
              }&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;

              MODRDN
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              &lt;repeat { "suffix:" &lt;database suffix DN&gt; }&gt;
              dn: &lt;DN&gt;
              newrdn: &lt;new RDN&gt;
              deleteoldrdn: &lt;0 or 1&gt;
              &lt;if new superior is specified: "newSuperior: &lt;DN&gt;"&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;

              SEARCH
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              &lt;repeat { "suffix:" &lt;database suffix DN&gt; }&gt;
              base: &lt;base DN&gt;
              scope: &lt;0-2, see ldap.h&gt;
              deref: &lt;0-3, see ldap.h&gt;
              sizelimit: &lt;size limit&gt;
              timelimit: &lt;time limit&gt;
              filter: &lt;filter&gt;
              attrsonly: &lt;0 or 1&gt;
              attrs: &lt;"all" or space-separated attribute list&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;

              UNBIND
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              &lt;repeat { "suffix:" &lt;database suffix DN&gt; }&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;

       The commands - except <b>unbind </b>- should output:
              RESULT
              code: &lt;integer&gt;
              matched: &lt;matched DN&gt;
              info: &lt;text&gt;
       where only RESULT is mandatory, and then close the socket.  The
       <b>search </b>RESULT should be preceded by the entries in LDIF format,
       each entry followed by a blank line.  Lines starting with `#' or
       `DEBUG:' are ignored.

       When used as an overlay, the external program should return a
       CONTINUE response if request processing should continue normally,
       or a regular RESULT response if the external program wishes to
       bypass the underlying database.

       If <b>sockresps </b>includes <b>result </b>or <b>search</b>, the overlay will also
       send any response messages to the external program (also see
       KNOWN LIMITATIONS). These will appear as an extended RESULT
       message or an ENTRY message respectively, both are defined below
       and the program is not expected to respond to these.

       The extended RESULT message is similar to the one above, but also
       includes the msgid and any configured extensions:
              RESULT
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              code: &lt;integer&gt;
              matched: &lt;matched DN&gt;
              info: &lt;text&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;

       Typically both the msgid and the connid will be needed to match a
       result message to a request. The ENTRY message has the form
              ENTRY
              msgid: &lt;message id&gt;
              &lt;entry in LDIF format&gt;
              &lt;blank line&gt;
</pre> <h2>
KNOWN LIMITATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sock </b>backend does not process extended operation results from
       an external program.

       If <b>sockresps </b>is configured, <b>sock </b>overlay does not consider
       <b>sockops </b>nor <b>sockdnpat </b>to decide which responses are passed onto
       the external program, instead, all responses are currently passed
       on.
</pre> <h2>
ACCESS CONTROL </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sock </b>backend does not honor all ACL semantics as described in
       <a href="slapd.access.5.html">slapd.access(5)</a>.  In general, access to objects is checked by
       using a dummy object that contains only the DN, so access rules
       that rely on the contents of the object are not honored.  In
       detail:

       The <b>add </b>operation does not require <b>write (=w) </b>access to the
       <b>children </b>pseudo-attribute of the parent entry.

       The <b>bind </b>operation requires <b>auth (=x) </b>access to the <b>entry </b>pseudo-
       attribute of the entry whose identity is being assessed; <b>auth</b>
       <b>(=x) </b>access to the credentials is not checked, but rather
       delegated to the underlying program.

       The <b>compare </b>operation requires <b>compare (=c) </b>access to the <b>entry</b>
       pseudo-attribute of the object whose value is being asserted;
       <b>compare (=c) </b>access to the attribute whose value is being
       asserted is not checked.

       The <b>delete </b>operation does not require <b>write (=w) </b>access to the
       <b>children </b>pseudo-attribute of the parent entry.

       The <b>modify </b>operation requires <b>write (=w) </b>access to the <b>entry</b>
       pseudo-attribute; <b>write (=w) </b>access to the specific attributes
       that are modified is not checked.

       The <b>modrdn </b>operation does not require <b>write (=w) </b>access to the
       <b>children </b>pseudo-attribute of the parent entry, nor to that of the
       new parent, if different; <b>write (=w) </b>access to the distinguished
       values of the naming attributes is not checked.

       The <b>search </b>operation does not require <b>search (=s) </b>access to the
       <b>entry </b>pseudo_attribute of the searchBase; <b>search (=s) </b>access to
       the attributes and values used in the filter is not checked.

       The <b>extended </b>operation does not require any access special
       rights.  The external program has to implement any sort of access
       control.
