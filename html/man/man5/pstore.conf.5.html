DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This file configures the behavior of <a href="../man8/systemd-pstore.8.html">systemd-pstore(8)</a>, a tool
       for archiving the contents of the persistent storage filesystem,
       <b>pstore</b>[1].
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE </h2>
<pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so
       configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from
       those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of
       the listed directories in order of priority, only the first file
       found is used: /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [2], /usr/lib/systemd/. The vendor
       version of the file contains commented out entries showing the
       defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can
       also be created by creating drop-ins, as described below. The
       main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose (or a
       copy in /etc/ if it's shipped under /usr/), however using
       drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over
       modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration
       snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/.
       Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main
       configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic
       order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside.
       When multiple files specify the same option, for options which
       accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last
       takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values,
       entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can
       install drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
       local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
       configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have
       to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to
       prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit
       number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a
       concept of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship
       drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range used by
       users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding
       accidentally drop-ins defined by users. It is recommended to use
       the range 10-40 for drop-ins in /usr/ and the range 60-90 for
       drop-ins in /etc/ and /run/, to make sure that local and
       transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by the OS
       vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the
       recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the
       configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the
       vendor configuration file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       All options are configured in the [PStore] section:

       <i>Storage=</i>
           Controls where to archive (i.e. copy) files from the pstore
           filesystem. One of "none", "external", and "journal". When
           "none", the tool exits without processing files in the pstore
           filesystem. When "external" (the default), files are archived
           into /var/lib/systemd/pstore/, and logged into the journal.
           When "journal", pstore file contents are logged only in the
           journal.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>Unlink=</i>
           Controls whether or not files are removed from pstore after
           processing. Takes a boolean value. When true, a pstore file
           is removed from the pstore once it has been archived (either
           to disk or into the journal). When false, processing of
           pstore files occurs normally, but the files remain in the
           pstore. The default is true in order to maintain the pstore
           in a nearly empty state, so that the pstore has storage
           available for the next kernel error event.

           Added in version 243.

       The defaults for all values are listed as comments in the
       template /etc/systemd/pstore.conf file that is installed by
       default.

        2. ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£ Please note that those configuration files must
           be available at all times. If /usr/local/ is a separate
           partition, it may not be available during early boot, and
           must not be used for configuration.
