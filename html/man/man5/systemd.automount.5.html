NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd.automount - Automount unit configuration
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>automount</i>.automount
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".automount" encodes
       information about a file system automount point controlled and
       supervised by systemd. Automount units may be used to implement
       on-demand mounting as well as parallelized mounting of file
       systems.

       This man page lists the configuration options specific to this
       unit type. See <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for the common options of all unit
       configuration files. The common configuration items are
       configured in the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The
       automount specific configuration options are configured in the
       [Automount] section.

       Automount units must be named after the automount directories
       they control. Example: the automount point /home/lennart must be
       configured in a unit file home-lennart.automount. For details
       about the escaping logic used to convert a file system path to a
       unit name see <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>. Note that automount units cannot
       be templated, nor is it possible to add multiple names to an
       automount unit by creating symlinks to its unit file.

       For each automount unit file a matching mount unit file (see
       <a href="systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount(5)</a> for details) must exist which is activated when
       the automount path is accessed. Example: if an automount unit
       home-lennart.automount is active and the user accesses
       /home/lennart the mount unit home-lennart.mount will be
       activated.

       Note that automount units are separate from the mount itself, so
       you should not set <i>After=</i> or <i>Requires=</i> for mount dependencies
       here. For example, you should not set <i>After=network-online.target</i>
       or similar on network filesystems. Doing so may result in an
       ordering cycle.

       Note that automount support on Linux is privileged, automount
       units are hence only available in the system service manager (and
       root's user service manager), but not in unprivileged users'
       service managers.

       Note that automount units should not be nested. (The
       establishment of the inner automount point would unconditionally
       pin the outer mount point, defeating its purpose.)
</pre> <h2>
AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Implicit Dependencies</b>
       The following dependencies are implicitly added:

       •   If an automount unit is beneath another mount unit in the
           file system hierarchy, a requirement and ordering
           dependencies are created to the on the unit higher in the
           hierarchy.

       •   An implicit <i>Before=</i> dependency is created between an
           automount unit and the mount unit it activates.

   <b>Default Dependencies</b>
       The following dependencies are added unless
       <i>DefaultDependencies=no</i> is set:

       •   Automount units acquire automatic <i>Before=</i> and <i>Conflicts=</i> on
           umount.target in order to be stopped during shutdown.

       •   Automount units automatically gain an <i>After=</i> dependency on
           local-fs-pre.target, and a <i>Before=</i> dependency on
           local-fs.target.
</pre> <h2>
FSTAB </h2>
<pre>
       Automount units may either be configured via unit files, or via
       /etc/fstab (see <a href="fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a> for details).

       For details how systemd parses /etc/fstab see <a href="systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount(5)</a>.

       If an automount point is configured in both /etc/fstab and a unit
       file, the configuration in the latter takes precedence.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Automount unit files may include [Unit] and [Install] sections,
       which are described in <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>.

       Automount unit files must include an [Automount] section, which
       carries information about the file system automount points it
       supervises. The options specific to the [Automount] section of
       automount units are the following:

       <i>Where=</i>
           Takes an absolute path of a directory of the automount point.
           If the automount point does not exist at time that the
           automount point is installed, it is created. This string must
           be reflected in the unit filename. (See above.) This option
           is mandatory.

       <i>ExtraOptions=</i>
           Extra mount options to use when creating the autofs
           mountpoint. This takes a comma-separated list of options.
           This setting is optional. Note that the usual specifier
           expansion is applied to this setting, literal percent
           characters should hence be written as "%%".

           Added in version 250.

       <i>DirectoryMode=</i>
           Directories of automount points (and any parent directories)
           are automatically created if needed. This option specifies
           the file system access mode used when creating these
           directories. Takes an access mode in octal notation. Defaults
           to 0755.

       <i>TimeoutIdleSec=</i>
           Configures an idle timeout. Once the mount has been idle for
           the specified time, systemd will attempt to unmount. Takes a
           unit-less value in seconds, or a time span value such as
           "5min 20s". Pass 0 to disable the timeout logic. The timeout
           is disabled by default.

           Added in version 220.

       more settings.
