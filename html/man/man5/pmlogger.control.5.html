NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogger.control </b>- control files for Performance Co-Pilot
       archiving
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Historical archiving of performance data for Performance Co-Pilot
       (see <a href="../man1/pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) uses <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> and one or more instances of
       <b>pmlogger </b>may be managed by <a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> and
       <a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>.

       <a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> may be run at any time of the day and is
       intended to check that the desired set of <b>pmlogger </b>processes are
       running.  If not, it (re-)starts any missing logger processes.
       By default, <a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> also calls <a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> with a
       <b>-K </b>option to execute any required archive compression tasks.

       <a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> is intended to be run once per day, preferably
       in the early morning, as soon after midnight as practicable.  Its
       task is to aggregate, rotate and perform general housekeeping for
       one or more sets of PCP archives.

       Both <a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> and <a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> operate on a family
       of shared control files, namely the <i>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH</i>
       file and files within the <i>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d</i> directory.
       These files must not be writable by any user other than root.

       The control file(s) should be customized according to the
       following rules that define for the current version (1.1) of the
       control file format.

       1.  Lines beginning with a ``#'' are comments.  A special case is
           lines beginning ``#!#''; these are control lines for a
           <b>pmlogger </b>that has been stopped using <a href="../man1/pmlogctl.1.html">pmlogctl(1)</a>.
       2.  Lines beginning with a ``$'' are assumed to be assignments to
           environment variables in the style of <b>sh</b>(1), and all text
           following the ``$'' will be <b>eval</b>'ed by the script reading the
           control file, and the corresponding variable exported into
           the environment.  This is particularly useful to set and
           export variables into the environment of the administrative
           scripts, e.g.
               $ PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=20
           If the value to the right of the ``='' contains any white
           space, then the value should be enclosed in double (") or
           single (') quotes.
       3.  There <b>must </b>be a version line in the control file of the form:
               $version=1.1
       4.  Fields within a line of the control file(s) are usually
           separated by one or more spaces or tabs (although refer to
           the description of the <i>directory</i> field below for some
           important exceptions).
       5.  There should be one line in the control file(s) for each
           <b>pmlogger </b>instance with at least 4 fields of the form:
               <i>host primary socks directory args</i> ...
       6.  The <i>host</i> field is the name of the host that is the source of
           the performance metrics for this <b>pmlogger </b>instance.  The
           reserved word <b>LOCALHOSTNAME </b>will be replaced by the name of
           the local host.
       7.  The <i>primary</i> field indicates if this is a primary <b>pmlogger</b>
           instance (<b>y</b>) or not (<b>n</b>).  Since the primary logger must run
           on the local host, and there may be at most one primary
           logger for a particular host, this field can be <b>y </b>for at most
           one <b>pmlogger </b>instance, in which case the host name must be
           the name of the local host (or <b>LOCALHOSTNAME</b>).
       8.  The <i>socks</i> field indicates if this <b>pmlogger </b>instance needs to
           be started under the control of <a href="../man1/pmsocks.1.html">pmsocks(1)</a> to connect to a
           <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> through a firewall (<b>y </b>or <b>n</b>).
       9.  The <i>directory</i> field is a directory name.  All archive files
           associated with this <b>pmlogger </b>instance will be created in
           this directory, and this will be the current directory for
           the execution of any programs required to maintain those
           archives.  A useful convention is that primary logger
           archives for the local host with hostname <i>myhost</i> are
           maintained in the directory <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/myhost</i> (this is
           where the default <b>pmlogger </b>start-up script in <i>$PCP_RC_DIR/pcp</i>
           will create the archives), while archives for the remote host
           <i>mumble</i> are maintained in <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/mumble</i>.
       10. The <i>directory</i> field may contain embedded shell syntax that
           will be evaluated by <b>sh</b>(1) to produce the real directory name
           to be used.  The allowed constructs are:
           • Any text (including white space) enclosed with <b>$( </b>and <b>)</b>
             will be interpreted as a shell command.
           • Any text (including white space) enclosed with <b>` </b>and <b>`</b>
             (back quotes) will be interpreted as a shell command.
           • Within a single line only one style of embedded shell
             command is allowed, so either <b>$(</b>...<b>)  </b>or <b>`</b>...<b>`</b>, but not
             both.
           • An initial double quote (") followed by arbitrary text
             (including white space, but excluding an embedded double
             quote) and a final double quote.
           • An initial single quote (') followed by arbitrary text
             (including white space, but excluding an embedded single
             quote) and a final single quote.
           • Any word containing a <b>$ </b>(assumed to introduce an
             environment variable name).
       11. In the <i>directory</i> field, the reserved word <b>LOCALHOSTNAME </b>will
           be replaced by the name of the local host.
       12. The optional <i>args</i> field and any remaining fields are
           interpreted as arguments to be passed to <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.  Most
           typically this would be at least the <b>-c </b>option to specify the
           metrics to be logged and the logging frequencies.

       The following sample control lines specify a primary logger on
       the local host (<i>bozo</i>), and non-primary loggers to collect and log
       performance metrics from the hosts <i>wobbly</i>, <i>boing</i> and the local
       host (i.e. <i>bozo</i>).

       $version=1.1
       bozo          y  n  $PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/bozo   -c config.default
       wobbly        n  n  "/store/wobbly/$(date +%Y)"  -c ./wobbly.config
       boing         n  n  $PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/boing   -c ./pmlogger.config
       LOCALHOSTNAME n  n /cluster/LOCALHOSTNAME   -c ./precious.config

SCHEDULED EXECUTION </h2>
<pre>
       The periodic execution of <a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> and <a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>
       is controlled by either <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> or <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a>.

       Typical <a href="crontab.5.html">crontab(5)</a> entries are provided in
       <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/crontab</i> (unless installed by default in
       <i>/etc/cron.d</i> already) and shown below.

       # daily processing of archives
       14      0       *       *       *       $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily
       # every 30 minutes, check pmlogger instances are running
       25,55   *       *       *       *       $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_check

       When using <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> on Linux, no <b>crontab </b>entries are needed as
       the timer mechanism provided by <b>systemd </b>is used instead to
       achieve the same period execution as the crontab example above.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH</i>
            the PCP logger control file.  For a new installation this
            file contains no <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> control lines (the real control
            files are all in the <i>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d</i> directory),
            but this file is still processed to support any legacy
            configurations therein from earlier PCP releases.
            <b>Warning</b>: this file must not be writable by any user other
            than root.

       <i>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d</i>
            optional directory containing additional PCP logger control
            files, with one or more per <b>pmlogger </b>specification per file.
            <b>Warning</b>: the files herein must not be writable by any user
            other than root.

       <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/crontab</i>
            sample crontab for automated script execution by $PCP_USER
            (or root).  Exists only if the platform does not support the
            /etc/cron.d mechanism.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
