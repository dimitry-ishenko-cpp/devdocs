NAME </h2>
<pre>
       crypttab - Configuration for encrypted block devices
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/crypttab
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The /etc/crypttab file describes encrypted block devices that are
       set up during system boot.

       Empty lines and lines starting with the "#" character are
       ignored. Each of the remaining lines describes one encrypted
       block device. Fields are delimited by white space.

       Each line is in the form

           <i>volume-name encrypted-device key-file options</i>

       The first two fields are mandatory, the remaining two are
       optional.

       Setting up encrypted block devices using this file supports four
       encryption modes: LUKS, TrueCrypt, BitLocker and plain. See
       <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a> for more information about each mode. When no mode
       is specified in the options field and the block device contains a
       LUKS signature, it is opened as a LUKS device; otherwise, it is
       assumed to be in raw dm-crypt (plain mode) format.

       The four fields of /etc/crypttab are defined as follows:

        1. The first field contains the name of the resulting volume
           with decrypted data; its block device is set up below
           /dev/mapper/.

        2. The second field contains a path to the underlying block
           device or file, or a specification of a block device via
           "UUID=" followed by the UUID.

        3. The third field specifies an absolute path to a file with the
           encryption key. Optionally, the path may be followed by ":"
           and an /etc/fstab style device specification (e.g. starting
           with "LABEL=" or similar); in which case the path is taken
           relative to the specified device's file system root. If the
           field is not present or is "none" or "-", a key file named
           after the volume to unlock (i.e. the first column of the
           line), suffixed with .key is automatically loaded from the
           /etc/cryptsetup-keys.d/ and /run/cryptsetup-keys.d/
           directories, if present. Otherwise, the password has to be
           manually entered during system boot. For swap encryption,
           /dev/urandom may be used as key file, resulting in a
           randomized key.

           If the specified key file path refers to an <b>AF_UNIX </b>stream
           socket in the file system, the key is acquired by connecting
           to the socket and reading it from the connection. This allows
           the implementation of a service to provide key information
           dynamically, at the moment when it is needed. For details see
           below.

        4. The fourth field, if present, is a comma-delimited list of
           options. The supported options are listed below.
</pre> <h2>
KEY ACQUISITION </h2>
<pre>
       Six different mechanisms for acquiring the decryption key or
       passphrase unlocking the encrypted volume are supported.
       Specifically:

        1. Most prominently, the user may be queried interactively
           during volume activation (i.e. typically at boot), asking
           them to type in the necessary passphrases.

        2. The (unencrypted) key may be read from a file on disk,
           possibly on removable media. The third field of each line
           encodes the location, for details see above.

        3. The (unencrypted) key may be requested from another service,
           by specifying an <b>AF_UNIX </b>file system socket in place of a key
           file in the third field. For details see above and below.

        4. The key may be acquired via a PKCS#11 compatible hardware
           security token or smartcard. In this case a saved key used in
           unlock process is stored on disk/removable media, acquired
           via <b>AF_UNIX</b>, or stored in the LUKS2 JSON token metadata
           header. For RSA, the saved key is an encrypted volume key.
           The encrypted volume key is then decrypted by the PKCS#11
           token with an RSA private key stored on it, and used to
           unlock the encrypted volume. For elliptic-curve (EC)
           cryptography, the saved key is the public key generated in
           enrollment process. The public key is then used to derive a
           shared secret with a private key stored in the PKCS#11 token.
           The derived shared secret is then used to unlock the volume.
           Use the <b>pkcs11-uri= </b>option described below to use this
           mechanism.

        5. Similarly, the key may be acquired via a FIDO2 compatible
           hardware security token (which must implement the
           "hmac-secret" extension). In this case a key generated
           randomly during enrollment is stored on disk/removable media,
           acquired via <b>AF_UNIX</b>, or stored in the LUKS2 JSON token
           metadata header. The random key is hashed via a keyed hash
           function (HMAC) on the FIDO2 token, using a secret key stored
           on the token that never leaves it. The resulting hash value
           is then used as key to unlock the encrypted volume. Use the
           <b>fido2-device= </b>option described below to use this mechanism.

        6. Similarly, the key may be acquired via a TPM2 security chip.
           In this case a (during enrollment) randomly generated key —
           encrypted by an asymmetric key derived from the TPM2 chip's
           seed key — is stored on disk/removable media, acquired via
           <b>AF_UNIX</b>, or stored in the LUKS2 JSON token metadata header.
           Use the <b>tpm2-device= </b>option described below to use this
           mechanism.

       For the latter five mechanisms the source for the key material
       used for unlocking the volume is primarily configured in the
       third field of each /etc/crypttab line, but may also be
       configured in /etc/cryptsetup-keys.d/ and /run/cryptsetup-keys.d/
       (see above) or in the LUKS2 JSON token header (in case of the
       latter three). Use the <a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a> tool to enroll
       PKCS#11, FIDO2 and TPM2 devices in LUKS2 volumes.
</pre> <h2>
SUPPORTED OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options may be used in the fourth field of each
       line:

       <b>cipher=</b>
           Specifies the cipher to use. See <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a> for possible
           values and the default value of this option. A cipher with
           unpredictable IV values, such as "aes-cbc-essiv:sha256", is
           recommended. Embedded commas in the cipher specification need
           to be escaped by preceding them with a backslash, see example
           below.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>discard</b>
           Allow discard requests to be passed through the encrypted
           block device. This improves performance on SSD storage but
           has security implications.

           Added in version 207.

       <b>hash=</b>
           Specifies the hash to use for password hashing. See
           <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a> for possible values and the default value of
           this option.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>header=</b>
           Use a detached (separated) metadata device or file where the
           header containing the master key(s) is stored. This option is
           only relevant for LUKS and TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt devices. See
           <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a> for possible values and the default value of
           this option.

           Optionally, the path may be followed by ":" and an /etc/fstab
           device specification (e.g. starting with "UUID=" or similar);
           in which case, the path is relative to the device file system
           root. The device gets mounted automatically for LUKS device
           activation duration only.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>keyfile-offset=</b>
           Specifies the number of bytes to skip at the start of the key
           file. See <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a> for possible values and the default
           value of this option.

           Added in version 187.

       <b>keyfile-size=</b>
           Specifies the maximum number of bytes to read from the key
           file. See <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a> for possible values and the default
           value of this option. This option is ignored in plain
           encryption mode, as the key file size is then given by the
           key size.

           Added in version 188.

       <b>keyfile-erase</b>
           If enabled, the specified key file is erased after the volume
           is activated or when activation fails. This is in particular
           useful when the key file is only acquired transiently before
           activation (e.g. via a file in /run/, generated by a service
           running before activation), and shall be removed after use.
           Defaults to off.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>key-slot=</b>
           Specifies the key slot to compare the passphrase or key
           against. If the key slot does not match the given passphrase
           or key, but another would, the setup of the device will fail
           regardless. This option implies <b>luks</b>. See <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a> for
           possible values. The default is to try all key slots in
           sequential order.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>keyfile-timeout=</b>
           Specifies the timeout for the device on which the key file
           resides or the device used as the key file, and falls back to
           a password if it could not be accessed. See
           <a href="../man8/systemd-cryptsetup-generator.8.html">systemd-cryptsetup-generator(8)</a> for key files on external
           devices.

           Added in version 243.

       <b>link-volume-key=</b>
           Specifies the kernel keyring and key description (see
           <a href="../man7/keyrings.7.html">keyrings(7)</a>) where LUKS2 volume key gets linked during device
           activation. The kernel keyring description and key
           description must be separated by "::".

           The kernel keyring part can be a string description or a
           predefined kernel keyring prefixed with "@" (e.g.: to use
           "@s" session or "@u" user keyring directly). The type prefix
           text in the kernel keyring description is not required. The
           specified kernel keyring must already exist at the time of
           device activation.

           The key part is a string description optionally prefixed by a
           "%key_type:". If no type is specified, the "user" type key is
           linked by default. See <a href="../man1/keyctl.1.html">keyctl(1)</a> for more information on key
           descriptions (KEY IDENTIFIERS section).

           Note that the linked volume key is not cleaned up
           automatically when the device is detached.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>luks</b>
           Force LUKS mode. When this mode is used, the following
           options are ignored since they are provided by the LUKS
           header on the device: <b>cipher=</b>, <b>hash=</b>, <b>size=</b>.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>bitlk</b>
           Decrypt BitLocker drive. Encryption parameters are deduced by
           cryptsetup from BitLocker header.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>_netdev</b>
           Marks this cryptsetup device as requiring network. It will be
           started after the network is available, similarly to
           <a href="systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount(5)</a> units marked with <b>_netdev</b>. The service unit
           to set up this device will be ordered between
           remote-fs-pre.target and remote-cryptsetup.target, instead of
           cryptsetup-pre.target and cryptsetup.target.

           Hint: if this device is used for a mount point that is
           specified in <a href="fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a>, the <b>_netdev </b>option should also be used
           for the mount point. Otherwise, a dependency loop might be
           created where the mount point will be pulled in by
           local-fs.target, while the service to configure the network
           is usually only started <i>after</i> the local file system has been
           mounted.

           Added in version 235.

       <b>noauto</b>
           This device will not be added to cryptsetup.target. This
           means that it will not be automatically unlocked on boot,
           unless something else pulls it in. In particular, if the
           device is used for a mount point, it'll be unlocked
           automatically during boot, unless the mount point itself is
           also disabled with <b>noauto</b>.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>nofail</b>
           This device will not be a hard dependency of
           cryptsetup.target. It'll still be pulled in and started, but
           the system will not wait for the device to show up and be
           unlocked, and boot will not fail if this is unsuccessful.
           Note that other units that depend on the unlocked device may
           still fail. In particular, if the device is used for a mount
           point, the mount point itself also needs to have the <b>nofail</b>
           option, or the boot will fail if the device is not unlocked
           successfully. If a keyfile and/or a <b>header </b>are specified, the
           dependencies on their respective directories will also not be
           fatal, so that umounting said directories will not cause the
           generated cryptset unit to be deactivated.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>offset=</b>
           Start offset in the backend device, in 512-byte sectors. This
           option is only relevant for plain devices.

           Added in version 220.

       <b>plain</b>
           Force plain encryption mode.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>read-only</b>, <b>readonly</b>
           Set up the encrypted block device in read-only mode.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>same-cpu-crypt</b>
           Perform encryption using the same CPU that IO was submitted
           on. The default is to use an unbound workqueue so that
           encryption work is automatically balanced between available
           CPUs.

           This requires kernel 4.0 or newer.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>submit-from-crypt-cpus</b>
           Disable offloading writes to a separate thread after
           encryption. There are some situations where offloading write
           requests from the encryption threads to a dedicated thread
           degrades performance significantly. The default is to offload
           write requests to a dedicated thread because it benefits the
           CFQ scheduler to have writes submitted using the same
           context.

           This requires kernel 4.0 or newer.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>no-read-workqueue</b>
           Bypass dm-crypt internal workqueue and process read requests
           synchronously. The default is to queue these requests and
           process them asynchronously.

           This requires kernel 5.9 or newer.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>no-write-workqueue</b>
           Bypass dm-crypt internal workqueue and process write requests
           synchronously. The default is to queue these requests and
           process them asynchronously.

           This requires kernel 5.9 or newer.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>skip=</b>
           How many 512-byte sectors of the encrypted data to skip at
           the beginning. This is different from the <b>offset= </b>option with
           respect to the sector numbers used in initialization vector
           (IV) calculation. Using <b>offset= </b>will shift the IV calculation
           by the same negative amount. Hence, if <b>offset=</b><i>n</i> is given,
           sector <i>n</i> will get a sector number of 0 for the IV
           calculation. Using <b>skip= </b>causes sector <i>n</i> to also be the first
           sector of the mapped device, but with its number for IV
           generation being <i>n</i>.

           This option is only relevant for plain devices.

           Added in version 220.

       <b>size=</b>
           Specifies the key size in bits. See <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a> for
           possible values and the default value of this option.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>sector-size=</b>
           Specifies the sector size in bytes. See <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a> for
           possible values and the default value of this option.

           Added in version 240.

       <b>swap</b>
           The encrypted block device will be used as a swap device, and
           will be formatted accordingly after setting up the encrypted
           block device, with <a href="../man8/mkswap.8.html">mkswap(8)</a>. This option implies <b>plain</b>.

               <b>Warning</b>
               Using the <b>swap </b>option will destroy the contents of the
               named partition during every boot, so make sure the
               underlying block device is specified correctly.
           Added in version 186.

       <b>tcrypt</b>
           Use TrueCrypt encryption mode. When this mode is used, the
           following options are ignored since they are provided by the
           TrueCrypt header on the device or do not apply: <b>cipher=</b>,
           <b>hash=</b>, <b>keyfile-offset=</b>, <b>keyfile-size=</b>, <b>size=</b>.

           When this mode is used, the passphrase is read from the key
           file given in the third field. Only the first line of this
           file is read, excluding the new line character.

           Note that the TrueCrypt format uses both passphrase and key
           files to derive a password for the volume. Therefore, the
           passphrase and all key files need to be provided. Use
           <b>tcrypt-keyfile= </b>to provide the absolute path to all key
           files. When using an empty passphrase in combination with one
           or more key files, use "/dev/null" as the password file in
           the third field.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>tcrypt-hidden</b>
           Use the hidden TrueCrypt volume. This option implies <b>tcrypt</b>.

           This will map the hidden volume that is inside of the volume
           provided in the second field. Please note that there is no
           protection for the hidden volume if the outer volume is
           mounted instead. See <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a> for more information on
           this limitation.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>tcrypt-keyfile=</b>
           Specifies the absolute path to a key file to use for a
           TrueCrypt volume. This implies <b>tcrypt </b>and can be used more
           than once to provide several key files.

           See the entry for <b>tcrypt </b>on the behavior of the passphrase
           and key files when using TrueCrypt encryption mode.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>tcrypt-system</b>
           Use TrueCrypt in system encryption mode. This option implies
           <b>tcrypt</b>.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>tcrypt-veracrypt</b>
           Check for a VeraCrypt volume. VeraCrypt is a fork of
           TrueCrypt that is mostly compatible, but uses different,
           stronger key derivation algorithms that cannot be detected
           without this flag. Enabling this option could substantially
           slow down unlocking, because VeraCrypt's key derivation takes
           much longer than TrueCrypt's. This option implies <b>tcrypt</b>.

           Added in version 232.

       <b>veracrypt-pim=</b>
           Specifies a custom Personal Iteration Multiplier (PIM) value,
           which can range from 0..2147468 for standard veracrypt
           volumes and 0..65535 for veracrypt system volumes. A value of
           0 will imply the VeraCrypt default. This option is only
           effective when <b>tcrypt-veracrypt </b>is set.

           Note that VeraCrypt enforces a minimal allowed PIM value
           depending on the password strength and the hash algorithm
           used for key derivation, however <b>veracrypt-pim= </b>is not
           checked against these bounds. See <b>Veracrypt Personal</b>
           <b>Iterations Multiplier</b>[1] documentation for more information.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>timeout=</b>
           Specifies the timeout for querying for a password. If no unit
           is specified, seconds is used. Supported units are s, ms, us,
           min, h, d. A timeout of 0 waits indefinitely (which is the
           default).

           Added in version 186.

       <b>tmp=</b>
           The encrypted block device will be prepared for using it as
           /tmp/; it will be formatted using <a href="../man8/mkfs.8.html">mkfs(8)</a>. Takes a file
           system type as argument, such as "ext4", "xfs" or "btrfs". If
           no argument is specified defaults to "ext4". This option
           implies <b>plain</b>.

               <b>Warning</b>
               Using the <b>tmp </b>option will destroy the contents of the
               named partition during every boot, so make sure the
               underlying block device is specified correctly.
           Added in version 186.

       <b>tries=</b>
           Specifies the maximum number of times the user is queried for
           a password. The default is 3. If set to 0, the user is
           queried for a password indefinitely.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>headless=</b>
           Takes a boolean argument, defaults to false. If true, never
           query interactively for the password/PIN. Useful for headless
           systems.

           Added in version 249.

       <b>verify</b>
           If the encryption password is read from console, it has to be
           entered twice to prevent typos.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>password-echo=yes|no|masked</b>
           Controls whether to echo passwords or security token PINs
           that are read from console. Takes a boolean or the special
           string "masked". The default is <b>password-echo=masked</b>.

           If enabled, the typed characters are echoed literally. If
           disabled, the typed characters are not echoed in any form,
           the user will not get feedback on their input. If set to
           "masked", an asterisk ("*") is echoed for each character
           typed. Regardless of which mode is chosen, if the user hits
           the tabulator key ("↹") at any time, or the backspace key
           ("⌫") before any other data has been entered, then echo is
           turned off.

           Added in version 249.

       <b>pkcs11-uri=</b>
           Takes either the special value "auto" or an <b>RFC7512 PKCS#11</b>
           <b>URI</b>[2] pointing to a private key which is used to decrypt the
           encrypted key specified in the third column of the line. This
           is useful for unlocking encrypted volumes through PKCS#11
           compatible security tokens or smartcards. See below for an
           example how to set up this mechanism for unlocking a LUKS2
           volume with a YubiKey security token.

           If specified as "auto" the volume must be of type LUKS2 and
           must carry PKCS#11 security token metadata in its LUKS2 JSON
           token section. In this mode the URI and the encrypted key are
           automatically read from the LUKS2 JSON token header. Use
           <a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a> as a simple tool for enrolling PKCS#11
           security tokens or smartcards in a way compatible with
           "auto". In this mode the third column of the line should
           remain empty (that is, specified as "-").

           The specified URI can refer directly to a private key stored
           on a token or alternatively just to a slot or token, in which
           case a search for a suitable private key will be performed.
           In this case if multiple suitable objects are found the token
           is refused. The keyfile configured in the third column of the
           line is used as is (i.e. in binary form, unprocessed). The
           resulting decrypted key (for RSA) or derived shared secret
           (for ECC) is then Base64 encoded before it is used to unlock
           the LUKS volume.

           Use <b>systemd-cryptenroll --pkcs11-token-uri=list </b>to list all
           suitable PKCS#11 security tokens currently plugged in, along
           with their URIs.

           Note that many newer security tokens that may be used as
           PKCS#11 security token typically also implement the newer and
           simpler FIDO2 standard. Consider using <b>fido2-device=</b>
           (described below) to enroll it via FIDO2 instead. Note that a
           security token enrolled via PKCS#11 cannot be used to unlock
           the volume via FIDO2, unless also enrolled via FIDO2, and
           vice versa.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>fido2-device=</b>
           Takes either the special value "auto" or the path to a
           "hidraw" device node (e.g.  /dev/hidraw1) referring to a
           FIDO2 security token that implements the "hmac-secret"
           extension (most current hardware security tokens do). See
           below for an example how to set up this mechanism for
           unlocking an encrypted volume with a FIDO2 security token.

           If specified as "auto" the FIDO2 token device is
           automatically discovered, as it is plugged in.

           FIDO2 volume unlocking requires a client ID hash (CID) to be
           configured via <b>fido2-cid= </b>(see below) and a key to pass to
           the security token's HMAC functionality (configured in the
           line's third column) to operate. If not configured and the
           volume is of type LUKS2, the CID and the key are read from
           LUKS2 JSON token metadata instead. Use <a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a>
           as simple tool for enrolling FIDO2 security tokens,
           compatible with this automatic mode, which is only available
           for LUKS2 volumes.

           Use <b>systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device=list </b>to list all
           suitable FIDO2 security tokens currently plugged in, along
           with their device nodes.

           This option implements the following mechanism: the
           configured key is hashed via they HMAC keyed hash function
           the FIDO2 device implements, keyed by a secret key embedded
           on the device. The resulting hash value is Base64 encoded and
           used to unlock the LUKS2 volume. As it should not be possible
           to extract the secret from the hardware token, it should not
           be possible to retrieve the hashed key given the configured
           key — without possessing the hardware token.

           Note that many security tokens that implement FIDO2 also
           implement PKCS#11, suitable for unlocking volumes via the
           <b>pkcs11-uri= </b>option described above. Typically the newer,
           simpler FIDO2 standard is preferable.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>fido2-cid=</b>
           Takes a Base64 encoded FIDO2 client ID to use for the FIDO2
           unlock operation. If specified, but <b>fido2-device= </b>is not,
           <b>fido2-device=auto </b>is implied. If <b>fido2-device= </b>is used but
           <b>fido2-cid= </b>is not, the volume must be of LUKS2 type, and the
           CID is read from the LUKS2 JSON token header. Use
           <a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a> for enrolling a FIDO2 token in the
           LUKS2 header compatible with this automatic mode.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>fido2-rp=</b>
           Takes a string, configuring the FIDO2 Relying Party (rp) for
           the FIDO2 unlock operation. If not specified
           "io.systemd.cryptsetup" is used, except if the LUKS2 JSON
           token header contains a different value. It should normally
           not be necessary to override this.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>fido2-pin=</b>
           Controls whether to require the user to enter a PIN when
           unlocking the volume (the FIDO2 "clientPin" feature). This
           option only applies when in manual mode, i.e. when <b>fido2-cid=</b>
           option is set. Defaults to neither true or false, but rather
           to <b>v248 </b>behavior, that is: try with no PIN first, but if
           token reports that PIN is required, try again asking for PIN.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>fido2-up=</b>
           Controls whether to require the user to verify presence (tap
           the token, the FIDO2 "up" feature) when unlocking the volume.
           This option only applies when in manual mode, i.e. when
           <b>fido2-cid= </b>option is set. Defaults to neither true or false,
           but rather to <b>v248 </b>behavior, that is: try with no UP first,
           but if token reports that UP is required, try again with UP
           enabled.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>fido2-uv=</b>
           Controls whether to require user verification (the FIDO2 "uv"
           feature) when unlocking the volume. This option only applies
           when in manual mode, i.e. when <b>fido2-cid= </b>option is set.
           Defaults to neither true or false, but rather to <b>v248</b>
           behavior, that is: omit configuring UV whatsoever.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>tpm2-device=</b>
           Takes either the special value "auto" or the path to a device
           node (e.g.  /dev/tpmrm0) referring to a TPM2 security chip.
           See below for an example how to set up this mechanism for
           unlocking an encrypted volume with a TPM2 chip.

           Use <b>tpm2-pcrs= </b>(see below) to configure the set of TPM2 PCRs
           to bind the volume unlocking to. Use <a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a>
           as simple tool for enrolling TPM2 security chips in LUKS2
           volumes.

           If specified as "auto" the TPM2 device is automatically
           discovered. Use <b>systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-device=list </b>to
           list all suitable TPM2 devices currently available, along
           with their device nodes.

           This option implements the following mechanism: when
           enrolling a TPM2 device via <b>systemd-cryptenroll </b>on a LUKS2
           volume, a randomized key unlocking the volume is generated on
           the host and loaded into the TPM2 chip where it is encrypted
           with an asymmetric "primary" key pair derived from the TPM2's
           internal "seed" key. Neither the seed key nor the primary key
           are permitted to ever leave the TPM2 chip — however, the now
           encrypted randomized key may. It is saved in the LUKS2 volume
           JSON token header. When unlocking the encrypted volume, the
           primary key pair is generated on the TPM2 chip again (which
           works as long as the chip's seed key is correctly maintained
           by the TPM2 chip), which is then used to decrypt (on the TPM2
           chip) the encrypted key from the LUKS2 volume JSON token
           header saved there during enrollment. The resulting decrypted
           key is then used to unlock the volume. When the randomized
           key is encrypted the current values of the selected PCRs (see
           below) are included in the operation, so that different PCR
           state results in different encrypted keys and the decrypted
           key can only be recovered if the same PCR state is
           reproduced.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>tpm2-pcrs=</b>
           Takes a "+" separated list of numeric TPM2 PCR (i.e.
           "Platform Configuration Register") indexes to bind the TPM2
           volume unlocking to. This option is only useful when TPM2
           enrollment metadata is not available in the LUKS2 JSON token
           header already, the way <b>systemd-cryptenroll </b>writes it there.
           If not used (and no metadata in the LUKS2 JSON token header
           defines it), defaults to a list of a single entry: PCR 7.
           Assign an empty string to encode a policy that binds the key
           to no PCRs, making the key accessible to local programs
           regardless of the current PCR state.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>tpm2-pin=</b>
           Takes a boolean argument, defaults to "false". Controls
           whether TPM2 volume unlocking is bound to a PIN in addition
           to PCRs. Similarly, this option is only useful when TPM2
           enrollment metadata is not available.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>tpm2-signature=</b>
           Takes an absolute path to a TPM2 PCR JSON signature file, as
           produced by the <a href="../man1/systemd-measure.1.html">systemd-measure(1)</a> tool. This permits locking
           LUKS2 volumes to any PCR values for which a valid signature
           matching a public key specified at key enrollment time can be
           provided. See <a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a> for details on enrolling
           TPM2 PCR public keys. If this option is not specified but it
           is attempted to unlock a LUKS2 volume with a signed TPM2 PCR
           enrollment a suitable signature file tpm2-pcr-signature.json
           is searched for in /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/,
           /usr/lib/systemd/ (in this order).

           Added in version 252.

       <b>tpm2-pcrlock=</b>
           Takes an absolute path to a TPM2 pcrlock policy file, as
           produced by the <b>systemd-pcrlock</b>(1) tool. This permits locking
           LUKS2 volumes to a local policy of allowed PCR values with
           variants. See <a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a> for details on enrolling
           TPM2 pcrlock policies. If this option is not specified but it
           is attempted to unlock a LUKS2 volume with a TPM2 pcrlock
           enrollment a suitable signature file pcrlock.json is searched
           for in /run/systemd/ and /var/lib/systemd/ (in this order).

           Added in version 255.

       <b>tpm2-measure-pcr=</b>
           Controls whether to measure the volume key of the encrypted
           volume to a TPM2 PCR. If set to "no" (which is the default)
           no PCR extension is done. If set to "yes" the volume key is
           measured into PCR 15. If set to a decimal integer in the
           range 0...23 the volume key is measured into the specified
           PCR. The volume key is measured along with the activated
           volume name and its UUID. This functionality is particularly
           useful for the encrypted volume backing the root file system,
           as it then allows later TPM objects to be securely bound to
           the root file system and hence the specific installation.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>tpm2-measure-bank=</b>
           Selects one or more TPM2 PCR banks to measure the volume key
           into, as configured with <b>tpm2-measure-pcr= </b>above. Multiple
           banks may be specified, separated by a colon character. If
           not specified automatically determines available and used
           banks. Expects a message digest name (e.g.  "sha1", "sha256",
           ...) as argument, to identify the bank.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>token-timeout=</b>
           Specifies how long to wait at most for configured security
           devices (i.e. FIDO2, PKCS#11, TPM2) to show up. Takes a time
           value in seconds (but other time units may be specified too,
           see <a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)</a> for supported formats). Defaults to 30s.
           Once the specified timeout elapsed authentication via
           password is attempted. Note that this timeout applies to
           waiting for the security device to show up — it does not
           apply to the PIN prompt for the device (should one be needed)
           or similar. Pass 0 to turn off the time-out and wait forever.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>try-empty-password=</b>
           Takes a boolean argument. If enabled, right before asking the
           user for a password it is first attempted to unlock the
           volume with an empty password. This is useful for systems
           that are initialized with an encrypted volume with only an
           empty password set, which shall be replaced with a suitable
           password during first boot, but after activation.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>x-systemd.device-timeout=</b>
           Specifies how long systemd should wait for a block device to
           show up before giving up on the entry. The argument is a time
           in seconds or explicitly specified units of "s", "min", "h",
           "ms".

           Added in version 216.

       <b>x-initrd.attach</b>
           Setup this encrypted block device in the initrd, similarly to
           <a href="systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount(5)</a> units marked with <b>x-initrd.mount</b>.

           Although it's not necessary to mark the mount entry for the
           root file system with <b>x-initrd.mount</b>, <b>x-initrd.attach </b>is
           still recommended with the encrypted block device containing
           the root file system as otherwise systemd will attempt to
           detach the device during the regular system shutdown while
           it's still in use. With this option the device will still be
           detached but later after the root file system is unmounted.

           All other encrypted block devices that contain file systems
           mounted in the initrd should use this option.

           Added in version 245.

       At early boot and when the system manager configuration is
       reloaded, this file is translated into native systemd units by
       <a href="../man8/systemd-cryptsetup-generator.8.html">systemd-cryptsetup-generator(8)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
AF_UNIX KEY FILES </h2>
<pre>
       If the key file path (as specified in the third column of
       /etc/crypttab entries, see above) refers to an <b>AF_UNIX </b>stream
       socket in the file system, the key is acquired by connecting to
       the socket and reading the key from the connection. The
       connection is made from an <b>AF_UNIX </b>socket name in the abstract
       namespace, see <a href="../man7/unix.7.html">unix(7)</a> for details. The source socket name is
       chosen according to the following format:

           <b>NUL </b><i>RANDOM</i> /cryptsetup/ <i>VOLUME</i>

       In other words: a <b>NUL </b>byte (as required for abstract namespace
       sockets), followed by a random string (consisting of alphanumeric
       characters only), followed by the literal string "/cryptsetup/",
       followed by the name of the volume to acquire they key for. For
       example, for the volume "myvol":

           \0d7067f78d9827418/cryptsetup/myvol

       Services listening on the <b>AF_UNIX </b>stream socket may query the
       source socket name with <a href="../man2/getpeername.2.html">getpeername(2)</a>, and use this to determine
       which key to send, allowing a single listening socket to serve
       keys for multiple volumes. If the PKCS#11 logic is used (see
       above), the socket source name is picked in similar fashion,
       except that the literal string "/cryptsetup-pkcs11/" is used. And
       similarly for FIDO2 ("/cryptsetup-fido2/") and TPM2
       ("/cryptsetup-tpm2/"). A different path component is used so that
       services providing key material know that the secret key was not
       requested directly, but instead an encrypted key that will be
       decrypted via the PKCS#11/FIDO2/TPM2 logic to acquire the final
       secret key.

       <b>Example 2. Yubikey-based PKCS#11 Volume Unlocking Example</b>

       The PKCS#11 logic allows hooking up any compatible security token
       that is capable of storing RSA or EC cryptographic keys for
       unlocking an encrypted volume. Here's an example how to set up a
       Yubikey security token for this purpose on a LUKS2 volume, using
       <b>ykmap</b>(1) from the yubikey-manager project to initialize the token
       and <a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a> to add it in the LUKS2 volume:

           # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT-0

           # Destroy any old key on the Yubikey (careful!)
           ykman piv reset

           # Generate a new private/public key pair on the device, store the public key in
           # 'pubkey.pem'.
           ykman piv generate-key -a RSA2048 9d pubkey.pem

           # Create a self-signed certificate from this public key, and store it on the
           # device. The "subject" should be an arbitrary user-chosen string to identify
           # the token with.
           ykman piv generate-certificate --subject "Knobelei" 9d pubkey.pem

           # We don't need the public key anymore, let's remove it. Since it is not
           # security sensitive we just do a regular "rm" here.
           rm pubkey.pem

           # Enroll the freshly initialized security token in the LUKS2 volume. Replace
           # /dev/sdXn by the partition to use (e.g. /dev/sda1).
           sudo systemd-cryptenroll --pkcs11-token-uri=auto /dev/sdXn

           # Test: Let's run systemd-cryptsetup to test if this all worked.
           sudo systemd-cryptsetup attach mytest /dev/sdXn - pkcs11-uri=auto

           # If that worked, let's now add the same line persistently to /etc/crypttab,
           # for the future. We don't want to use the (unstable) /dev/sdX name, so let's
           # figure out a stable link:
           udevadm info -q -r symlink /dev/sdXn

           # Now add the line using the by-uuid symlink to /etc/crypttab:
           sudo bash -c 'echo "mytest /dev/disk/by-uuid/... - pkcs11-uri=auto" &gt;&gt;/etc/crypttab'

           # Depending on your distribution and encryption setup, you may need to manually
           # regenerate your initramfs to be able to use a Yubikey / PKCS#11 token to
           # unlock the partition during early boot.

           # On Fedora based systems:
           sudo dracut --force
           # On Debian based systems:
           sudo update-initramfs -u

       A few notes on the above:

       •   We use RSA2048, which is the longest key size current
           Yubikeys support

       •   We use Yubikey key slot 9d, since that's apparently the
           keyslot to use for decryption purposes, see <b>Yubico PIV</b>
           <b>certificate slots</b>[3].

       <b>Example 3. FIDO2 Volume Unlocking Example</b>

       The FIDO2 logic allows using any compatible FIDO2 security token
       that implements the "hmac-secret" extension for unlocking an
       encrypted volume. Here's an example how to set up a FIDO2
       security token for this purpose for a LUKS2 volume, using
       <a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a>:

           # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT-0

           # Enroll the security token in the LUKS2 volume. Replace /dev/sdXn by the
           # partition to use (e.g. /dev/sda1).
           sudo systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device=auto /dev/sdXn

           # Test: Let's run systemd-cryptsetup to test if this worked.
           sudo systemd-cryptsetup attach mytest /dev/sdXn - fido2-device=auto

           # If that worked, let's now add the same line persistently to /etc/crypttab,
           # for the future. We don't want to use the (unstable) /dev/sdX name, so let's
           # figure out a stable link:

           # Now add the line using the by-uuid symlink to /etc/crypttab:
           sudo bash -c 'echo "mytest /dev/disk/by-uuid/... - fido2-device=auto" &gt;&gt;/etc/crypttab'

           # Depending on your distribution and encryption setup, you may need to manually
           # regenerate your initramfs to be able to use a FIDO2 device to unlock the
           # partition during early boot.

       <b>Example 4. TPM2 Volume Unlocking Example</b>

       The TPM2 logic allows using any TPM2 chip supported by the Linux
       kernel for unlocking an encrypted volume. Here's an example how
       to set up a TPM2 chip for this purpose for a LUKS2 volume, using
       <a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a>:

           # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT-0

           # Enroll the TPM2 security chip in the LUKS2 volume, and bind it to PCR 7
           # only. Replace /dev/sdXn by the partition to use (e.g. /dev/sda1).
           sudo systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=7 /dev/sdXn

           # Test: Let's run systemd-cryptsetup to test if this worked.
           sudo systemd-cryptsetup attach mytest /dev/sdXn - tpm2-device=auto

           # If that worked, let's now add the same line persistently to /etc/crypttab,
           # for the future. We don't want to use the (unstable) /dev/sdX name, so let's
           # figure out a stable link:
           udevadm info -q -r symlink /dev/sdXn

           # Now add the line using the by-uuid symlink to /etc/crypttab:
           sudo bash -c 'echo "mytest /dev/disk/by-uuid/... - tpm2-device=auto" &gt;&gt;/etc/crypttab'

           # And now let's check that automatic unlocking works:
           sudo systemd-cryptsetup detach mytest
           sudo systemctl daemon-reload
           sudo systemctl start cryptsetup.target
           systemctl is-active systemd-cryptsetup@mytest.service

           # Once we have the device which will be unlocked automatically, we can use it.
           # Usually we would create a file system and add it to /etc/fstab:
           sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/mytest
           # This prints a 'Filesystem UUID', which we can use as a stable name:
           sudo bash -c 'echo "/dev/disk/by-uuid/... /var/mytest ext4 defaults,x-systemd.mkdir 0 2" &gt;&gt;/etc/fstab'
           # And now let's check that the mounting works:
           sudo systemctl daemon-reload
           sudo systemctl start /var/mytest
           systemctl status /var/mytest

           # Depending on your distribution and encryption setup, you may need to manually

           # the partition during early boot.
