NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-remote - Configuration for a remote
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Flatpak stores information about configured remotes for an
       installation location in $installation/repo/config. For example,
       the remotes for the default system-wide installation are in
       $prefix/var/lib/flatpak/repo/config, and the remotes for the
       per-user installation are in
       $HOME/.local/share/flatpak/repo/config.

       Normally, it is not necessary to edit remote config files
       directly, the <b>flatpak remote-modify </b>command should be used to
       change properties of remotes.

       System-wide remotes can be statically preconfigured by dropping
       <a href="flatpakrepo.5.html">flatpakrepo(5)</a> files into /etc/flatpak/remotes.d/.
</pre> <h2>
FILE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The remote config file format is using the same .ini file format
       that is used for systemd unit files or application .desktop
       files.

   <b>[remote ...]</b>
       All the configuration for the the remote with name NAME is
       contained in the [remote "NAME"] group.

       The following keys are recognized by OSTree, among others:

       <b>url </b>(string)
           The url for the remote. An URL of the form oci+https:// or
           oci+http:// is a Flatpak extension that indicates that the
           remote is not an ostree repository, but is rather an URL to
           an index of OCI images that are stored within a container
           image registry.

       <b>gpg-verify </b>(boolean)
           Whether to use GPG verification for content from this remote.

       <b>gpg-verify-summary </b>(boolean)
           Whether to use GPG verification for the summary of this
           remote.

           This is ignored if <b>collection-id </b>is set, as refs are verified
           in commit metadata in that case. Enabling <b>gpg-verify-summary</b>
           would break peer to peer distribution of refs.

       <b>collection-id </b>(string)
           The globally unique identifier for the upstream collection
           repository, to allow mirrors to be grouped.

       All flatpak-specific keys have a xa. prefix:

       <b>xa.disable </b>(boolean)
           Whether the remote is disabled. Defaults to false.

       <b>xa.prio </b>(integer)
           The priority for the remote. This is used when listing
           remotes, and when searching them for the runtime needed by an
           app. The remote providing the app is searched for its runtime
           before others with equal priority. Defaults to 1.

       <b>xa.noenumerate </b>(boolean)
           Whether this remote should be ignored when presenting
           available apps/runtimes, or when searching for a runtime
           dependency. Defaults to false.

       <b>xa.nodeps </b>(boolean)
           Whether this remote should be excluded when searching for
           dependencies. Defaults to false.

       <b>xa.title </b>(string)
           An optional title to use when presenting this remote in a UI.

       <b>xa.title-is-set </b>(boolean)
           This key is set to true if <b>xa.title </b>has been explicitly set.

       <b>xa.comment </b>(string)
           An optional single-line comment to use when presenting this
           remote in a UI.

       <b>xa.comment-is-set </b>(boolean)
           This key is set to true if <b>xa.comment </b>has been explicitly
           set.

       <b>xa.description </b>(string)
           An optional full-paragraph of text to use when presenting
           this remote in a UI.

       <b>xa.description-is-set </b>(boolean)
           This key is set to true if <b>xa.description </b>has been explicitly
           set.

       <b>xa.homepage </b>(string)
           An optional URL that points to a website for this repository
           to use when presenting this remote in a UI.

       <b>xa.homepage-is-set </b>(boolean)
           This key is set to true if <b>xa.homepage </b>has been explicitly
           set.

       <b>xa.icon </b>(string)
           An optional URL that points to an icon for this repository to
           use when presenting this remote in a UI.

       <b>xa.icon-is-set </b>(boolean)
           This key is set to true if <b>xa.icon </b>has been explicitly set.

       <b>xa.default-branch </b>(string)
           The default branch to use when installing from this remote.

       <b>xa.default-branch-is-set </b>(boolean)
           This key is set to true if <b>xa.default-branch </b>has been
           explicitly set.

       <b>xa.main-ref </b>(string)
           The main reference served by this remote. This is used for
           origin remotes of applications installed via a flatpakref
           file.
