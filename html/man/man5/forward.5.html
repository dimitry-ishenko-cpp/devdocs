</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>forward </b>— email forwarding information file
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Users may put a <b>.forward </b>file in their home directory.  If this
       file exists, <i>smtpd</i>(8) forwards email to the destinations
       specified therein.

       A <b>.forward </b>file contains a list of expansion values, as described
       in <i>aliases</i>(5).  Each expansion value should be on a line by
       itself.  However, the <b>.forward </b>mechanism differs from the aliases
       mechanism in that it disallows file inclusion (:include:) and it
       performs expansion under the user ID of the <b>.forward </b>file owner.

       Permissions on the <b>.forward </b>file are very strict and expansion is
       rejected if the file is group or world-writable; if the home
       directory is group writeable; or if the file is not owned by the
       user.

       Users should avoid editing the <b>.forward </b>file directly, to prevent
       delivery failures from occurring if a message arrives while the
       file is not fully written.  The best option is to use a temporary
       file and use the <i>mv</i>(1) command to atomically overwrite the former
       <b>.forward</b>.  Alternatively, setting the <i>sticky</i>(8) bit on the home
       directory will cause the <b>.forward </b>lookup to return a temporary
       failure, causing mails to be deferred.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>~/.forward</i>     Email forwarding information.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following file forwards mail to “user@example.com”, and pipes
       the same mail to “examplemda”.

             # empty lines are ignored

             user@example.com        # anything after # is ignored
             "|/path/to/examplemda"
