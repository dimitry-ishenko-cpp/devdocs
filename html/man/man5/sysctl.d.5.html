DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       At boot, <a href="../man8/systemd-sysctl.service.8.html">systemd-sysctl.service(8)</a> reads configuration files from
       the above directories to configure <a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl(8)</a> kernel parameters.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The configuration files contain a list of variable assignments,
       separated by newlines. Empty lines and lines whose first
       non-whitespace character is "#" or ";" are ignored.

       Note that either "/" or "."  may be used as separators within
       sysctl variable names. If the first separator is a slash,
       remaining slashes and dots are left intact. If the first
       separator is a dot, dots and slashes are interchanged.
       "kernel.domainname=foo" and "kernel/domainname=foo" are
       equivalent and will cause "foo" to be written to
       /proc/sys/kernel/domainname. Either
       "net.ipv4.conf.enp3s0/200.forwarding" or
       "net/ipv4/conf/enp3s0.200/forwarding" may be used to refer to
       /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/enp3s0.200/forwarding. A glob <a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob(7)</a>
       pattern may be used to write the same value to all matching keys.
       Keys for which an explicit pattern exists will be excluded from
       any glob matching. In addition, a key may be explicitly excluded
       from being set by any matching glob patterns by specifying the
       key name prefixed with a "-" character and not followed by "=",
       see SYNOPSIS.

       Any access permission errors and attempts to write variables not
       present on the local system are logged at debug level and do not
       cause the service to fail. Other types of errors when setting
       variables are logged with higher priority and cause the service
       to return failure at the end (after processing other variables).
       As an exception, if a variable assignment is prefixed with a
       single "-" character, failure to set the variable for any reason
       will be logged at debug level and will not cause the service to
       fail.

       The settings configured with sysctl.d files will be applied early
       on boot. The network interface-specific options will also be
       applied individually for each network interface as it shows up in
       the system. (More specifically, net.ipv4.conf.*, net.ipv6.conf.*,
       net.ipv4.neigh.*  and net.ipv6.neigh.*).

       Many sysctl parameters only become available when certain kernel
       modules are loaded. Modules are usually loaded on demand, e.g.
       when certain hardware is plugged in or network brought up. This
       means that <a href="../man8/systemd-sysctl.service.8.html">systemd-sysctl.service(8)</a> which runs during early boot
       will not configure such parameters if they become available after
       it has run. To set such parameters, it is recommended to add an
       <a href="../man7/udev.7.html">udev(7)</a> rule to set those parameters when they become available.
       Alternatively, a slightly simpler and less efficient option is to
       add the module to <a href="modules-load.d.5.html">modules-load.d(5)</a>, causing it to be loaded
       statically before sysctl settings are applied (see example
       below).
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE </h2>
<pre>
       Configuration files are read from directories in /etc/, /run/,
       /usr/local/lib/, and /usr/lib/, in order of precedence, as listed
       in the SYNOPSIS section above. Files must have the ".conf"
       extension. Files in /etc/ override files with the same name in
       /run/, /usr/local/lib/, and /usr/lib/. Files in /run/ override
       files with the same name under /usr/.

       All configuration files are sorted by their filename in
       lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they
       reside in. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry
       in the file with the lexicographically latest name will take
       precedence. Thus, the configuration in a certain file may either
       be replaced completely (by placing a file with the same name in a
       directory with higher priority), or individual settings might be
       changed (by specifying additional settings in a file with a
       different name that is ordered later).

       Packages should install their configuration files in /usr/lib/
       (distribution packages) or /usr/local/lib/ (local installs) [1].
       Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may
       use this logic to override the configuration files installed by
       vendor packages.

       It is recommended to prefix all filenames with a two-digit number
       and a dash to simplify the ordering. It is recommended to use the
       range 10-40 for configuration files in /usr/ and the range 60-90
       for configuration files in /etc/ and /run/, to make sure that
       local and transient configuration files will always take priority
       over configuration files shipped by the OS vendor.

       If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file
       supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink
       to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with the
       same filename as the vendor configuration file. If the vendor
       configuration file is included in the initrd image, the image has
       to be regenerated.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Example 1. Set kernel YP domain name</b>

       /etc/sysctl.d/domain-name.conf:

           kernel.domainname=example.com

       <b>Example 2. Apply settings available only when a certain module is</b>
       <b>loaded (method one)</b>

       /etc/udev/rules.d/99-bridge.rules:

           ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="module", KERNEL=="br_netfilter", \
                 RUN+="/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --prefix=/net/bridge"

       /etc/sysctl.d/bridge.conf:

           net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 0
           net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0
           net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 0

       This method applies settings when the module is loaded. Please
       note that, unless the br_netfilter module is loaded, bridged
       packets will not be filtered by Netfilter (starting with kernel
       3.18), so simply not loading the module is sufficient to avoid
       filtering.

       <b>Example 3. Apply settings available only when a certain module is</b>
       <b>loaded (method two)</b>

       /etc/modules-load.d/bridge.conf:

           br_netfilter

       /etc/sysctl.d/bridge.conf:

           net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 0
           net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0
           net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 0

       This method forces the module to be always loaded. Please note
       that, unless the br_netfilter module is loaded, bridged packets
       will not be filtered with Netfilter (starting with kernel 3.18),
       so simply not loading the module is sufficient to avoid
       filtering.

       <b>Example 4. Set network routing properties for all interfaces</b>

       /etc/sysctl.d/20-rp_filter.conf:

           net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 2
           net.ipv4.conf.*.rp_filter = 2
           -net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter
           net.ipv4.conf.hub0.rp_filter = 1

       The <b>rp_filter </b>key will be set to "2" for all interfaces, except
       "hub0". We set net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter first, so any
       interfaces which are added <i>later</i> will get this value (this also
       covers any interfaces detected while we're running). The glob
       matches any interfaces which were detected <i>earlier</i>. The glob will
       also match net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter, which we don't want to
       set at all, so it is explicitly excluded. And "hub0" is excluded
       from the glob because it has an explicit setting.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
        1. ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£ Please note that those configuration files must
           be available at all times. If /usr/local/ is a separate
           partition, it may not be available during early boot, and
           must not be used for configuration.
