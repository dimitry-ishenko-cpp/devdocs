NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ovsdb-server - _Server database schema

       Every <b>ovsdb-server </b>(version 2.9 or later) always hosts an
       instance of this schema, which holds information on the status
       and configuration of the server itself. This database is read-
       only. This manpage describes the schema for this database.
</pre> <h2>
TABLE SUMMARY </h2>
<pre>
       The following list summarizes the purpose of each of the tables
       in the <b>_Server </b>database.  Each table is described in more detail
       on a later page.

       Table     Purpose
       <b>Database  </b>Databases.
</pre> <h2>
Database TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       This table describes the databases hosted by the database server,
       with one row per database. As its database configuration and
       status changes, the server automatically and immediately updates
       the table to match.

       The OVSDB protocol specified in RFC 7047 does not provide a way
       for an OVSDB client to find out about some kinds of configuration
       changes, such as about databases added or removed while a client
       is connected to the server, or databases changing between
       read/write and read-only due to a transition between active and
       backup roles. This table provides a solution: clients can monitor
       the table’s contents to find out about important changes.

       Traditionally, <b>ovsdb-server </b>disconnects all of its clients when a
       significant configuration change occurs, because this prompts a
       well-written client to reassess what is available from the server
       when it reconnects. Because this table provides an alternative
       and more efficient way to find out about those changes, OVS 2.9
       also introduces the <b>set_db_change_aware </b>RPC, documented in
       <a href="../man7/ovsdb-server.7.html">ovsdb-server(7)</a>, to allow clients to suppress this disconnection
       behavior.

       When a database is removed from the server, in addition to
       <b>Database </b>table updates, the server sends <b>canceled </b>messages, as
       described in RFC 7047 section 4.1.4, in reply to outstanding
       transactions for the removed database. The server also cancels
       any outstanding monitoring initiated by <b>monitor </b>or <b>monitor_cond</b>
       requested on the removed database, sending the <b>monitor_canceled</b>
       RPC described in <a href="../man7/ovsdb-server.7.html">ovsdb-server(7)</a>. Only clients that disable
       disconnection with <b>set_db_change_aware </b>receive these messages.

       Clients can use the <b>_uuid </b>column in this table as a generation
       number. The server generates a fresh <b>_uuid </b>every time it adds a
       database, so that removing and then re-adding a database to the
       server causes its row <b>_uuid </b>to change.

   <b>Summary:</b>
       <b>name                          </b>string
       <b>model                         </b>string, one of <b>clustered</b>, <b>relay</b>, or
                                     <b>standalone</b>
       <b>schema                        </b>optional string
       <b>connected                     </b>boolean
       <i>Clustered Databases:</i>
         <b>leader                      </b>boolean
         <b>cid                         </b>optional uuid
         <b>sid                         </b>optional uuid
         <b>index                       </b>optional integer

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>name</b>: string
              The database’s name, as specified in its schema.

       <b>model</b>: string, one of <b>clustered</b>, <b>relay</b>, or <b>standalone</b>
              The storage model: <b>standalone </b>for a standalone or active-
              backup database, <b>clustered </b>for a clustered database, <b>relay</b>
              for a relay database.

       <b>schema</b>: optional string
              The database schema, as a JSON string. In the case of a
              clustered database, this is empty until it finishes
              joining its cluster. In the case of a relay database, this
              is empty until it connects to the relay source.

       <b>connected</b>: boolean
              True if the database is connected to its storage. A
              standalone database is always connected. A clustered
              database is connected if the server is in contact with a
              majority of its cluster. A relay database is connected if
              the server is in contact with the relay source, i.e. is
              connected to the server it syncs from. An unconnected
              database cannot be modified and its data might be
              unavailable or stale.

     <i>Clustered Databases:</i>

       These columns are most interesting and in some cases only
       relevant for clustered databases, that is, those where the <b>model</b>
       column is <b>clustered</b>.

       <b>leader</b>: boolean
              True if the database is the leader in its cluster. For a
              standalone or active-backup database, this is always true.
              For a relay database, this is always false.

       <b>cid</b>: optional uuid
              The cluster ID for this database, which is the same for
              all of the servers that host this particular clustered
              database. For a standalone, active-backup or relay
              database, this is empty.

       <b>sid</b>: optional uuid
              The server ID for this database, different for each server
              that hosts a particular clustered database. A server that
              hosts more than one clustered database will have a
              different <b>sid </b>in each one. For a standalone, active-backup
              or relay database, this is empty.

       <b>index</b>: optional integer
              For a clustered database, the index of the log entry
              currently exposed to clients. For a given server, this
              increases monotonically. When a client switches from one
              server to another in a cluster, it can ensure that it
              never sees an older snapshot of data by avoiding servers
              that have <b>index </b>less than the largest value they have
              already observed.

              For a standalone, active-backup or relay database, this is
              empty.
