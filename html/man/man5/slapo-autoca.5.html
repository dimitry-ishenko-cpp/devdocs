NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-autoca - Automatic Certificate Authority overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Automatic CA overlay generates X.509 certificate/key pairs
       for entries in the directory. The DN of a generated certificate
       is identical to the DN of the entry containing it. On startup it
       looks for a CA certificate and key in the suffix entry of the
       database which it will use to sign all subsequently generated
       certificates. A new CA certificate and key will be generated and
       stored in the suffix entry if none already exists. The CA
       certificate is stored in the cACertificate;binary attribute of
       the suffix entry, and the private key is stored in the
       cAPrivateKey;binary attribute of the suffix entry. These
       attributes may be overwritten if some other CA certificate/key
       pair is desired for use.

       Certificates for users and servers are generated on demand using
       a Search request returning only the userCertificate;binary and
       userPrivateKey;binary attributes. Any Search for anything besides
       exactly these two attributes is ignored by the overlay. Note that
       these values are stored in ASN.1 DER form in the directory so the
       ";binary" attribute option is mandatory.

       Entries that do not belong to selected objectClasses will be
       ignored by the overlay. By default, entries of objectClass <b>person</b>
       will be treated as users, and entries of objectClass <b>ipHost </b>will
       be treated as servers. There are slight differences in the set of
       X.509V3 certificate extensions added to the certificate between
       users and servers.

       The CA's private key is stored in a <b>cAPrivateKey </b>attribute, and
       user and server private keys are stored in the <b>userPrivateKey</b>
       attribute. The private key values are encoded in PKCS#8 format.
       It is essential that access to these attributes be properly
       secured with ACLs. Both of these attributes inherit from the
       <b>pKCS8PrivateKey </b>attribute, so it is sufficient to use a single
       ACL rule like

               access to attrs=pKCS8PrivateKey by self ssf=128 write

       at the beginning of the rules.

       Currently there is no automated management for expiration or
       revocation.  Obsolete certificates and keys must be manually
       removed by deleting an entry's userCertificate and userPrivateKey
       attributes.

CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf </b>options apply to the Automatic CA overlay.  They
       should appear after the <b>overlay </b>directive.

       <b>userClass &lt;objectClass&gt;</b>
              Specify the objectClass to be treated as user entries.

       <b>serverClass &lt;objectClass&gt;</b>
              Specify the objectClass to be treated as server entries.

       <b>userKeybits &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the size of the private key to use for user
              certificates.  The default is 2048 and the minimum is 512.

       <b>serverKeybits &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the size of the private key to use for server
              certificates.  The default is 2048 and the minimum is 512.

       <b>caKeybits &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the size of the private key to use for the CA
              certificate.  The default is 2048 and the minimum is 512.

       <b>userDays &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the duration for a user certificate's validity.
              The default is 365, 1 year.

       <b>serverDays &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the duration for a server certificate's validity.
              The default is 1826, 5 years.

       <b>caDays &lt;integer&gt;</b>
              Specify the duration for the CA certificate's validity.
              The default is 3652, 10 years.

       <b>localDN &lt;DN&gt;</b>
              Specify the DN of an entry that represents this server.
              Requests to generate a certificate/key pair for this DN
              will also install the certificate and key into slapd's TLS
              settings in cn=config for immediate use.
