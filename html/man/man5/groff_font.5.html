       groff_font - GNU <i>roff</i> device and font description files
</pre> <h2>
Description </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>groff</i> font and output device description formats are slight
       extensions of those used by AT&amp;T device-independent <i>troff</i>.  In
       distinction to the AT&amp;T implementation, <i>groff</i> lacks a binary
       format; all files are text files.  (Plan 9 <i>troff</i> has also
       abandoned the binary format.)  The device and font description
       files for a device <i>name</i> are stored in a <i>dev</i>name directory.  The
       device description file is called <i>DESC</i>, and, for each font
       supported by the device, a font description file is called <i>f,</i>
       where <i>f</i> is usually an abbreviation of a font's name and/or style.
       For example, the <b>ps </b>(PostScript) device has <i>groff</i> font
       description files for Times roman (<b>TR</b>) and Zapf Chancery Medium
       italic (<b>ZCMI</b>), among many others, while the <b>utf8 </b>device (for
       terminals) has only font descriptions for the roman, italic,
       bold, and bold-italic styles (<b>R</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>BI</b>, respectively).

       Device and font description files are read by the formatter,
       <i>troff</i>, and by output drivers.  The programs typically delegate
       these files' processing to an internal library, <i>libgroff</i>,
       ensuring their consistent interpretation.
</pre> <i><h2>DESC</h2></i> file format <pre>
       The <i>DESC</i> file contains a series of directives; each begins a
       line.  Their order is not important, with two exceptions: (1) the
       <b>res </b>directive must precede any <b>papersize </b>directive; and (2) the
       <b>charset </b>directive must come last (if at all).  If a directive
       name is repeated, later entries in the file override previous
       ones (except that the paper dimensions are computed based on the
       <b>res </b>directive last seen when <b>papersize </b>is encountered).  Spaces
       and/or tabs separate words and are ignored at line boundaries.
       Comments start with the “<b>#</b>” character and extend to the end of a
       line.  Empty lines are ignored.

       <b>family </b><i>fam</i>
              The default font family is <i>fam</i>.

       <b>fonts </b><i>n F1</i> ... <i>Fn</i>
              Fonts <i>F1</i>, ..., <i>Fn</i> are mounted at font positions <i>m</i>+1, ...,
              <i>m</i>+<i>n</i> where <i>m</i> is the number of <b>styles </b>(see below).  This
              directive may extend over more than one line.  A font name
              of <b>0 </b>causes no font to be mounted at the corresponding
              position.

       <b>hor </b><i>n</i>  The horizontal motion quantum is <i>n</i> basic units.
              Horizontal quantities are rounded to multiples of <i>n.</i>

       <b>image_generator </b><i>program</i>
              Use <i>program</i> to generate PNG images from PostScript input.
              Under GNU/Linux, this is usually <i>gs</i>(1), but under other
              systems (notably Cygwin) it might be set to another name.
              The <i>grohtml</i>(1) driver uses this directive.

       <b>paperlength </b><i>n</i>
              The vertical dimension of the output medium is <i>n</i> basic
              units (deprecated: use <b>papersize </b>instead).

       <b>papersize </b><i>format-or-dimension-pair-or-file-name</i> ...
              The dimensions of the output medium are as according to
              the argument, which is either a standard paper format, a
              pair of dimensions, or the name of a plain text file
              containing either of the foregoing.  Recognized paper
              formats are the ISO and DIN formats <b>A0</b>–<b>A7</b>, <b>B0</b>–<b>B7</b>, <b>C0</b>–<b>C7</b>,
              and <b>D0</b>–<b>D7</b>; the U.S. formats <b>letter</b>, <b>legal</b>, <b>tabloid</b>,
              <b>ledger</b>, <b>statement</b>, and <b>executive</b>; and the envelope formats
              <b>com10</b>, <b>monarch</b>, and <b>DL</b>.  Matching is performed without
              regard for lettercase.

              Alternatively, the argument can be a custom paper format
              <i>length</i><b>,</b><i>width</i> (with no spaces before or after the comma).
              Both <i>length</i> and <i>width</i> must have a unit appended; valid
              units are “<b>i</b>” for inches, “<b>c</b>” for centimeters, “<b>p</b>” for
              points, and “<b>P</b>” for picas.  Example: “<b>12c,235p</b>”.  An
              argument that starts with a digit is always treated as a
              custom paper format.

              Finally, the argument can be a file name (e.g.,
              <i>/etc/papersize</i>); if the file can be opened, the first line
              is read and a match attempted against each other form.  No
              comment syntax is supported.

              More than one argument can be specified; each is scanned
              in turn and the first valid paper specification used.

       <b>paperwidth </b><i>n</i>
              The horizontal dimension of the output medium is <i>n</i> basic
              units (deprecated: use <b>papersize </b>instead).

       <b>pass_filenames</b>
              Direct <i>troff</i> to emit the name of the source file being
              processed.  This is achieved with the intermediate output
              command “<b>x F</b>”, which <i>grohtml</i> interprets.

       <b>postpro </b><i>program</i>
              Use <i>program</i> as the postprocessor.

       <b>prepro </b><i>program</i>
              Use <i>program</i> as a preprocessor.  The <b>html </b>and <b>xhtml </b>output
              devices use this directive.

       <b>print </b><i>program</i>
              Use <i>program</i> as the print spooler.  If omitted, <i>groff</i>'s <b>-l</b>
              and <b>-L </b>options are ignored.

       <b>res </b><i>n</i>  The device resolution is <i>n</i> basic units per inch.

       <b>sizes </b><i>s1</i> ... <i>sn</i> <b>0</b>
              The device has fonts at <i>s1</i>, ..., <i>sn</i> scaled points (see
              below).  The list of sizes must be terminated by a <b>0</b>.
              Each <i>si</i> can also be a range of sizes <i>m</i>–<i>n</i>.  The list can
              extend over more than one line.

       <b>sizescale </b><i>n</i>
              A typographical point is subdivided into <i>n</i> scaled points.
              The default is <b>1</b>.

       <b>styles </b><i>S1</i> ... <i>Sm</i>
              The first <i>m</i> font mounting positions are associated with
              styles <i>S1</i>, ..., <i>Sm</i>.

       <b>tcommand</b>
              The postprocessor can handle the <b>t </b>and <b>u </b>intermediate
              output commands.

       <b>unicode</b>
              The output device supports the complete Unicode
              repertoire.  This directive is useful only for devices
              which produce character entities instead of glyphs.

              If <b>unicode </b>is present, no <b>charset </b>section is required in
              the font description files since the Unicode handling
              built into <i>groff</i> is used.  However, if there are entries
              in a font description file's <b>charset </b>section, they either
              override the default mappings for those particular
              characters or add new mappings (normally for composite
              characters).

              The <b>utf8</b>, <b>html</b>, and <b>xhtml </b>output devices use this
              directive.

       <b>unitwidth </b><i>n</i>
              Quantities in the font description files are in basic
              units for fonts whose type size is <i>n</i> scaled points.

       <b>unscaled_charwidths</b>
              Make the font handling module always return unscaled glyph
              widths.  The <i>grohtml</i> driver uses this directive.

       <b>use_charnames_in_special</b>
              <i>troff</i> should encode named glyphs inside device control
              commands.  The <i>grohtml</i> driver uses this directive.

       <b>vert </b><i>n</i> The vertical motion quantum is <i>n</i> basic units.  Vertical
              quantities are rounded to multiples of <i>n.</i>

       <b>charset</b>
              This directive and the rest of the file are ignored.  It
              is recognized for compatibility with other <i>troff</i>
              implementations.  In GNU <i>troff</i>, character set repertoire
              is described on a per-font basis.

       <i>troff</i> recognizes but ignores the directives <b>spare1</b>, <b>spare2</b>, and
       <b>biggestfont</b>.

       The <b>res</b>, <b>unitwidth</b>, <b>fonts</b>, and <b>sizes </b>lines are mandatory.
       Directives not listed above are ignored by <i>troff</i> but may be used
       by postprocessors to obtain further information about the device.
</pre> <h2>
Font description file format </h2>
<pre>
       On typesetting output devices, each font is typically available
       at multiple sizes.  While paper measurements in the device
       description file are in absolute units, measurements applicable
       to fonts must be proportional to the type size.  <i>groff</i> achieves
       this using the precedent set by AT&amp;T device-independent <i>troff</i>:
       one font size is chosen as a norm, and all others are scaled
       linearly relative to that basis.  The “unit width” is the number
       of basic units per point when the font is rendered at this
       nominal size.

       For instance, <i>groff</i>'s <b>lbp </b>device uses a <b>unitwidth </b>of 800.  Its
       Times roman font (“<b>TR</b>”) has a <b>spacewidth </b>of 833; this is also the
       width of its comma, period, centered period, and mathematical
       asterisk, while its “M” is 2,963 basic units.  Thus, an “M” on
       the <b>lbp </b>device is 2,963 basic units wide at a notional type size
       of 800 points.  (800-point type is not practical for most
       purposes, but using it enables the quantities in the font
       description files to be expressed as integers.)

       A font description file has two sections.  The first is a
       sequence of directives, and is parsed similarly to the <i>DESC</i> file
       described above.  Except for the directive names that begin the
       second section, their ordering is immaterial.  Later directives
       of the same name override earlier ones, spaces and tabs are
       handled in the same way, and the same comment syntax is
       supported.  Empty lines are ignored throughout.

       <b>name </b><i>F</i> The name of the font is <i>F</i>.  “<b>DESC</b>” is an invalid font
              name.  Simple integers are valid, but their use is
              discouraged.  (<i>groff</i> requests and escape sequences
              interpret non-negative integers as mounting positions
              instead.  Further, a font named “<b>0</b>” cannot be
              automatically mounted by the <b>fonts </b>directive of a <i>DESC</i>
              file.)

       <b>spacewidth </b><i>n</i>
              The width of an unadjusted inter-word space is <i>n</i> basic
              units.

       The directives above must appear in the first section; those
       below are optional.

       <b>slant </b><i>n</i>
              The font's glyphs have a slant of <i>n</i> degrees; a positive <i>n</i>
              slants in the direction of text flow.

       <b>ligatures </b><i>lig1</i> ... <i>lign</i> [<b>0</b>]
              Glyphs <i>lig1</i>, ..., <i>lign</i> are ligatures; possible ligatures
              are <b>ff</b>, <b>fi</b>, <b>fl</b>, <b>ffi</b>, and <b>ffl</b>.  For compatibility with
              other <i>troff</i> implementations, the list of ligatures may be
              terminated with a <b>0</b>.  The list of ligatures must not
              extend over more than one line.

       <b>special</b>
              The font is <i>special</i>: when a glyph is requested that is not
              present in the formatter's currently selected font, the
              glyph is sought in any mounted fonts that bear this
              property.

       Other directives in this section are ignored by <i>troff</i>, but may be
       used by postprocessors to obtain further information about the
       font.

       The second section contains one or two subsections.  These can
       appear in either order; the first one encountered commences the
       second section.  Each starts with a directive on a line by
       itself.  A <b>charset </b>subsection is mandatory unless the associated
       <i>DESC</i> file contains the <b>unicode </b>directive.  Another subsection,
       <b>kernpairs</b>, is optional.

       The directive <b>charset </b>starts the character set subsection.  (On
       typesetters, this directive is misnamed since it starts a list of
       glyphs, not characters.)  It precedes a series of glyph
       descriptions, one per line.  Each such glyph description
       comprises a set of fields separated by spaces or tabs and
       organized as follows.

              <i>name metrics type code</i> [<i>entity-name</i>] [<b>-- </b><i>comment</i>]

       <i>name</i> identifies the glyph: a printable character <i>c</i> corresponds to
       the <i>troff</i> ordinary character <i>c</i>, and a multi-character sequence
       not beginning with <b>\</b>, corresponds to the GNU <i>troff</i> special
       character escape sequence “<b>\[</b><i>name</i><b>]</b>”.  A name consisting of three
       minus signs, “<b>---</b>”, indicates that the glyph is unnamed: such
       glyphs can be accessed only by the <b>\N </b>escape sequence in <i>troff</i>.
       A special character named “<b>---</b>” can still be defined using <b>.char</b>
       and similar requests.  The <i>name</i> “<b>\-</b>” defines the minus sign
       glyph.  Finally, <i>name</i> can be the horizontal motion escape
       sequences, <b>\| </b>and <b>\^ </b>(“thin” and “hair” spaces, respectively), in
       which case only the width metric described below is applied; a
       font can thus customize the widths of these spaces.

       The form of the <i>metrics</i> field is as follows (on one line; it may
       be broken here for readability).

              <i>width</i>[<b>,</b>[<i>height</i>[<b>,</b>[<i>depth</i>[<b>,</b>[<i>italic-correction</i>[<b>,</b>[
              <i>left-italic-correction</i>[<b>,</b>[<i>subscript-correction</i>]]]]]]]]]]

       There must not be any spaces, tabs, or newlines between these
       <i>subfields,</i> which are in basic units expressed as decimal
       integers.  Unspecified subfields default to <b>0</b>.  Since there is no
       associated binary format, these values are not required to fit
       into the C language data type <b>char </b>as they are in AT&amp;T device-
       independent <i>troff</i>.

       The <i>width</i> subfield gives the width of the glyph.  The <i>height</i>
       subfield gives the height of the glyph (upwards is positive); if
       a glyph does not extend above the baseline, it should be given a
       zero height, rather than a negative height.  The <i>depth</i> subfield
       gives the depth of the glyph, that is, the distance below the
       baseline to which the glyph extends (downwards is positive); if a
       glyph does not extend below the baseline, it should be given a
       zero depth, rather than a negative depth.  Italic corrections are
       relevant to glyphs in italic or oblique styles.  The <i>italic-</i>
       <i>correction</i> is the amount of space that should be added after an
       oblique glyph to be followed immediately by an upright glyph.
       The <i>left-italic-correction</i> is the amount of space that should be
       added before an oblique glyph to be preceded immediately by an
       upright glyph.  The <i>subscript-correction</i> is the amount of space
       that should be added after an oblique glyph to be followed by a
       subscript; it should be less than the italic correction.

       For fonts used with typesetters, the <i>type</i> field gives a featural
       description of the glyph: it is a bit mask recording whether the
       glyph is an ascender, descender, both, or neither.  When a <b>\w</b>
       escape sequence is interpolated, these values are bitwise or-ed
       together for each glyph and stored in the <b>ct </b>register.  In font
       descriptions for terminals, all glyphs might have a type of zero,
       regardless of their appearance.

       0      means the glyph lies entirely between the baseline and a
              horizontal line at the “x-height” of the font, as with
              “a”, “c”, and “x”;

       1      means the glyph descends below the baseline, like “p”;

       2      means the glyph ascends above the font's x-height, like
              “A” or “b”); and

       3      means the glyph is both an ascender and a descender—this
              is true of parentheses in some fonts.

       The <i>code</i> field gives a numeric identifier that the postprocessor
       uses to render the glyph.  The glyph can be specified to <i>troff</i>
       using this code by means of the <b>\N </b>escape sequence.  The code can
       be any integer (that is, any integer parsable by the C standard
       library's <i>strtol</i>(3) function).

       The <i>entity-name</i> field defines an identifier for the glyph that
       the postprocessor uses to print the <i>troff</i> glyph <i>name</i>.  This field
       is optional; it was introduced so that the <i>grohtml</i> output driver
       could encode its character set.  For example, the glyph <b>\[Po] </b>is
       represented by “<b>&amp;pound;</b>” in HTML 4.0.  For efficiency, these data
       are now compiled directly into <i>grohtml</i>.  <i>grops</i> uses the field to
       build sub-encoding arrays for PostScript fonts containing more
       than 256 glyphs.

       Anything on the line after the <i>entity-name</i> field or “<b>--</b>” is
       ignored.  When <i>afmtodit</i> generates font description files for
       <i>gropdf</i>(1) and <i>grops</i>(1), it writes the UTF-16 code for the
       character to the comment field.

       A line in the <b>charset </b>section can also have the form
              <i>name</i> <b>"</b>
       identifying <i>name</i> as another name for the glyph mentioned in the
       preceding line.  Such aliases can be chained.

       The directive <b>kernpairs </b>starts a list of kerning adjustments to
       be made to adjacent glyph pairs from this font.  It contains a
       sequence of lines formatted as follows.
              <i>g1 g2 n</i>
       The foregoing means that when glyph <i>g1</i> is typeset immediately
       before <i>g2</i>, the space between them should be increased by <i>n</i>.  Most
       kerning pairs should have a negative value for <i>n</i>.
