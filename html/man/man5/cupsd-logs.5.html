</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cupsd-logs - cupsd log files (access_log, error_log, and
       page_log)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd(8)</a> normally maintains three log files: <i>access_log</i> to track
       requests that are submitted to the scheduler, <i>error_log</i> to track
       progress and errors, and <i>page_log</i> to track pages that are
       printed.  Configuration directives in <a href="cupsd.conf.5.html">cupsd.conf(5)</a> and
       <a href="cups-files.conf.5.html">cups-files.conf(5)</a> control what information is logged and where
       it is stored.

   <b>ACCESS LOG FILE FORMAT</b>
       The <i>access_log</i> file lists each HTTP resource that is accessed by
       a web browser or client.  Each line is in an extended version of
       the so-called "Common Log Format" used by many web servers and
       web reporting tools:

           <i>host group user date-time</i> "<i>method resource version</i>" <i>status bytes</i>
             <i>ipp-operation ipp-status</i>

       For example:

           10.0.1.2 - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:28 +0000] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 317
             CUPS-Get-Printers successful-ok-ignored-or-substituted-attributes
           localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1"
             200 0 - -
           localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] "POST / HTTP/1.1"
             200 157 CUPS-Get-Printers
             successful-ok-ignored-or-substituted-attributes
           localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] "POST / HTTP/1.1"
             200 1411 CUPS-Get-Devices -
           localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1"
             200 6667 - -

       The <i>host</i> field will normally only be an IP address unless you
       have enabled the HostNameLookups directive in the <i>cupsd.conf</i> file
       or if the IP address corresponds to your local machine.

       The <i>group</i> field always contains "-".

       The <i>user</i> field is the authenticated username of the requesting
       user.  If no username and password is supplied for the request
       then this field contains "-".

       The <i>date-time</i> field is the date and time of the request in local
       time and is in the format "[DD/MON/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ]".

       The <i>method</i> field is the HTTP method used: "GET", "HEAD",
       "OPTIONS", "POST", or "PUT".  "GET" requests are used to get
       files from the server, both for the web interface and to get
       configuration and log files.  "HEAD" requests are used to get
       information about a resource prior to a "GET".  "OPTIONS"
       requests are used to upgrade connections to TLS encryption.
       "POST" requests are used for web interface forms and IPP
       requests.  "PUT" requests are used to upload configuration files.

       The <i>resource</i> field is the filename of the requested resource.

       The <i>version</i> field is the HTTP specification version used by the
       client.  For CUPS clients this will always be "HTTP/1.1".

       The <i>status</i> field contains the HTTP result status of the request,
       as follows:

            200  Successful operation.

            201  File created/modified successfully.

            304  The requested file has not changed.

            400  Bad HTTP request; typically this means that you have a
                 malicious program trying to access your server.

            401  Unauthorized, authentication (username + password) is
                 required.

            403  Access is forbidden; typically this means that a client
                 tried to access a file or resource they do not have
                 permission to access.

            404  The file or resource does not exist.

            405  URL access method is not allowed; typically this means
                 you have a web browser using your server as a proxy.

            413  Request too large; typically this means that a client
                 tried to print a file larger than the MaxRequestSize
                 allows.

            426  Upgrading to TLS-encrypted connection.

            500  Server error; typically this happens when the server is
                 unable to open/create a file - consult the error_log
                 file for details.

            501  The client requested encryption but encryption support
                 is not enabled/compiled in.

            505  HTTP version number not supported; typically this means
                 that you have a malicious program trying to access your
                 server.

       The <i>bytes</i> field contains the number of bytes in the request.  For
       POST requests the bytes field contains the number of bytes of
       non-IPP data that is received from the client.

       The <i>ipp-operation</i> field contains either "-" for non-IPP requests
       or the IPP operation name for POST requests containing an IPP
       request.

       The <i>ipp-status</i> field contains either "-" for non-IPP requests or
       the IPP status code name for POST requests containing an IPP
       response.

   <b>ERROR LOG FILE FORMAT</b>
       The <i>error_log</i> file lists messages from the scheduler - errors,
       warnings, etc. The LogLevel directive in the <a href="cupsd.conf.5.html">cupsd.conf(5)</a> file
       controls which messages are logged:

           level date-time message

       For example:

           I [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] Queued on 'DeskJet' by 'mike'.
           D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[0]="DeskJet"
           D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[1]="1"
           D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[2]="mike"
           D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[3]="myjob"
           D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[4]="1"
           D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[5]="media=
             na_letter_8.5x11in sides=one-sided"
           D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[6]="/var/spool/cups/
             d000001-001"
           I [20/May/1999:19:21:02 +0000] [Job 2] Queued on 'DeskJet' by 'mike'.
           I [20/May/1999:19:22:24 +0000] [Job 2] Canceled by 'mike'.

       The <i>level</i> field contains the type of message:

       A    Alert message (LogLevel alert)

       C    Critical error message (LogLevel crit)

       D    Debugging message (LogLevel debug)

       d    Detailed debugging message (LogLevel debug2)

       E    Normal error message (LogLevel error)

       I    Informational message (LogLevel info)

       N    Notice message (LogLevel notice)

       W    Warning message (LogLevel warn)

       X    Emergency error message (LogLevel emerg)

       The <i>date-time</i> field contains the date and time of when the page
       started printing. The format of this field is identical to the
       data-time field in the <i>access_log</i> file.

       The <i>message</i> field contains a free-form textual message.  Messages
       from job filters are prefixed with "[Job NNN]" where "NNN" is the
       job ID.

   <b>PAGE LOG FILE FORMAT</b>
       The <i>page_log</i> file lists the total number of pages (sheets) that
       are printed.  By default, each line contains the following
       information:

           <i>printer user job-id date-time</i> <b>total </b><i>num-sheets job-billing</i>
             <i>job-originating-host-name job-name media sides</i>

       For example the entry for a two page job called "myjob" might
       look like:

           DeskJet root 1 [20/May/1999:19:21:06 +0000] total 2 acme-123
             localhost myjob na_letter_8.5x11in one-sided

       The PageLogFormat directive in the <a href="cupsd.conf.5.html">cupsd.conf(5)</a> file can be used
       to change this information.

       The <i>printer</i> field contains the name of the printer that printed
       the page.  If you send a job to a printer class, this field will
       contain the name of the printer that was assigned the job.

       The <i>user</i> field contains the name of the user (the IPP requesting-
       user-name attribute) that submitted this file for printing.

       The <i>job-id</i> field contains the job number of the page being
       printed.

       The <i>date-time</i> field contains the date and time of when the page
       started printing.  The format of this field is identical to the
       data-time field in the <i>access_log</i> file.

       The <i>num-sheets</i> field provides the total number of pages (sheets)
       that have been printed on for the job.

       The <i>job-billing</i> field contains a copy of the job-billing or job-
       account-id attributes provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-
       Job requests or "-" if neither was provided.

       The <i>job-originating-host-name</i> field contains the hostname or IP
       address of the client that printed the job.

       The <i>job-name</i> field contains a copy of the job-name attribute
       provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if
       none was provided.

       The <i>media</i> field contains a copy of the media or media-col/media-
       size attribute provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job
       requests or "-" if none was provided.

       The <i>sides</i> field contains a copy of the sides attribute provided
       with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if none was
       provided.
