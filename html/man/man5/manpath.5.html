</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       manpath - format of the /usr/local/etc/man_db.conf file
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The manpath configuration file is used by the manual page
       utilities to assess users' manpaths at run time, to indicate
       which manual page hierarchies (manpaths) are to be treated as
       system hierarchies and to assign them directories to be used for
       storing cat files.

       If the environment variable $<b>MANPATH </b>is already set, the
       information contained within /usr/local/etc/man_db.conf will not
       override it.
</pre> <h2>
SEARCH PATH </h2>
<pre>
       By default, man-db examines the user's $<b>PATH</b>.  For each
       <i>path_element</i> found there, it adds <i>manpath_element</i> to the search
       path.

       If there is no <b>MANPATH_MAP </b>line in the configuration file for a
       given <i>path_element</i>, then it adds all of <i>path_element/../man</i>,
       <i>path_element/man</i>, <i>path_element/../share/man</i>, and
       <i>path_element/share/man</i> that exist as directories to the search
       path.

       It then adds any <b>MANDATORY_MANPATH </b>entries from the configuration
       file to the search path.

       Finally, if the <b>--systems </b>option is used or the $<b>SYSTEM</b>
       environment variable is set, then that should consist of a
       sequence of operating system names separated by commas or colons.
       This acts as a template, expanding the search path once more to
       allow access to other operating systems' manual pages: for each
       system name, man-db looks for that name as a subdirectory of each
       entry in the search path, and adds it to the final search path if
       it exists.  A system name of <b>man </b>inserts the normal search path
       without subdirectories.  For example, if the search path would
       otherwise have been <i>/usr/share/man:/usr/local/man</i>, and $<b>SYSTEM </b>is
       set to <i>newOS:man</i>, then the final search path will be
       <i>/usr/share/man/newOS:/usr/share/man:/usr/local/man/newOS:/usr/local/man</i>.

       The $<b>MANPATH </b>environment variable overrides man-db's default
       manual page search paths.  Most users should not need to set it.
       Its syntax is similar to the $<b>PATH </b>environment variable: it
       consists of a sequence of directory names separated by colons.
       It overrides the default search path described above.

       If the value of $<b>MANPATH </b>starts with a colon, then the default
       search path is added at its start.  If the value of $<b>MANPATH </b>ends
       with a colon, then the default search path is added at its end.
       If the value of $<b>MANPATH </b>contains a double colon (<b>::</b>), then the
       default search path is inserted in the middle of the value,
       between the two colons.

FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The following field types are currently recognised:

       <b># </b><i>comment</i>
              Blank lines or those beginning with a <b># </b>will be treated as
              comments and ignored.

       <b>MANDATORY_MANPATH </b><i>manpath_element</i>
              Lines of this form indicate manpaths that every
              automatically generated $<b>MANPATH </b>should contain.  This
              will typically include <i>/usr/man</i>.

       <b>MANPATH_MAP </b><i>path_element manpath_element</i>
              Lines of this form set up $<b>PATH </b>to $<b>MANPATH </b>mappings.  For
              each <i>path_element</i> found in the user's $<b>PATH</b>,
              <i>manpath_element</i> will be added to the $<b>MANPATH</b>.

       <b>MANDB_MAP </b><i>manpath_element</i> [ <i>catpath_element</i> ]
              Lines of this form indicate which manpaths are to be
              treated as system manpaths, and optionally where their cat
              files should be stored.  This field type is particularly
              important if <b>man </b>is a setuid program, as (when in the
              system configuration file /usr/local/etc/man_db.conf
              rather than the per-user configuration file .manpath) it
              indicates which manual page hierarchies to access as the
              setuid user and which as the invoking user.

              The system manual page hierarchies are usually those
              stored under <i>/usr</i> such as <i>/usr/man</i>, <i>/usr/local/man</i> and
              <i>/usr/X11R6/man</i>.

              If cat pages from a particular <i>manpath_element</i> are not to
              be stored or are to be stored in the traditional location,
              <i>catpath_element</i> may be omitted.

              Traditional cat placement would be impossible for read
              only mounted manual page hierarchies and because of this
              it is possible to specify any valid directory hierarchy
              for their storage.  To observe the <b>Linux FSSTND </b>the
              keyword <b>FSSTND </b>can be used in place of an actual
              directory.

              Unfortunately, it is necessary to specify <b>all </b>system man
              tree paths, including alternate operating system paths
              such as <i>/usr/man/sun</i> and any <b>NLS locale </b>paths such as
              <i>/usr/man/de_DE.88591</i>.

              As the information is parsed line by line in the order
              written, it is necessary for any manpath that is a sub-
              hierarchy of another hierarchy to be listed first,
              otherwise an incorrect match will be made.  An example is
              that <i>/usr/man/de_DE.88591</i> must come before <i>/usr/man</i>.

       <b>DEFINE </b><i>key value</i>
              Lines of this form define miscellaneous configuration
              variables; see the default configuration file for those
              variables used by the manual pager utilities.  They
              include default paths to various programs (such as <i>grep</i>
              and <i>tbl</i>), and default sets of arguments to those programs.

       <b>SECTION </b><i>section</i> ...
              Lines of this form define the order in which manual
              sections should be searched.  If there are no <b>SECTION</b>
              directives in the configuration file, the default is:

                     SECTION 1 n l 8 3 0 2 3type 5 4 9 6 7

              If multiple <b>SECTION </b>directives are given, their section
              lists will be concatenated.

              If a particular extension is not in this list (say, 1mh)
              it will be displayed with the rest of the section it
              belongs to.  The effect of this is that you only need to
              explicitly list extensions if you want to force a
              particular order.  Sections with extensions should usually
              be adjacent to their main section (e.g. "1 1mh 8 ...").

              <b>SECTIONS </b>is accepted as an alternative name for this
              directive.

       <b>MINCATWIDTH </b><i>width</i>
              If the terminal width is less than <i>width</i>, cat pages will
              not be created (if missing) or displayed.  The default is
              80.

       <b>MAXCATWIDTH </b><i>width</i>
              If the terminal width is greater than <i>width</i>, cat pages
              will not be created (if missing) or displayed.  The
              default is 80.

       <b>CATWIDTH </b><i>width</i>
              If <i>width</i> is non-zero, cat pages will always be formatted
              for a terminal of the given width, regardless of the width
              of the terminal actually being used.  This overrides
              <b>MINCATWIDTH </b>and <b>MAXCATWIDTH</b>.

       <b>NOCACHE</b>
              This flag prevents <a href="../man1/man.1.html">man(1)</a> from creating cat pages
              automatically.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Unless the rules above are followed and observed precisely, the
       manual pager utilities will not function as desired.  The rules
       are overly complicated.
