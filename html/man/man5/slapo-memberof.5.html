NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-memberof - Reverse Group Membership overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>memberof </b>overlay to <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> allows automatic reverse group
       membership maintenance.  Any time a group entry is modified, its
       members are modified as appropriate in order to keep a DN-valued
       "is member of" attribute updated with the DN of the group.

       Note that the <b>dynlist </b>overlay can also provide this functionality
       and may be suitable for less demanding environments.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The config directives that are specific to the <b>memberof </b>overlay
       must be prefixed by <b>memberof-</b>, to avoid potential conflicts with
       directives specific to the underlying database or to other
       stacked overlays.

       <b>overlay memberof</b>
              This directive adds the memberof overlay to the current
              database; see <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> for details.

       The following <b>slapd.conf </b>configuration options are defined for
       the memberof overlay.

       <b>memberof-group-oc </b><i>&lt;group-oc&gt;</i>
              The value <i>&lt;group-oc&gt;</i> is the name of the objectClass that
              triggers the reverse group membership update.  It defaults
              to <i>groupOfNames</i>.

       <b>memberof-member-ad </b><i>&lt;member-ad&gt;</i>
              The value <i>&lt;member-ad&gt;</i> is the name of the attribute that
              contains the names of the members in the group objects; it
              must be DN-valued.  It defaults to <i>member</i>.

       <b>memberof-memberof-ad </b><i>&lt;memberof-ad&gt;</i>
              The value <i>&lt;memberof-ad&gt;</i> is the name of the attribute that
              contains the names of the groups an entry is member of; it
              must be DN-valued.  Its contents are automatically updated
              by the overlay.  It defaults to <i>memberOf</i>.

       <b>memberof-dn </b><i>&lt;dn&gt;</i>
              The value <i>&lt;dn&gt;</i> contains the DN that is used as
              <i>modifiersName</i> for internal modifications performed to
              update the reverse group membership.  It defaults to the
              <i>rootdn</i> of the underlying database.

       <b>memberof-dangling {</b><i>ignore</i><b>, </b><i>drop</i><b>, </b><i>error</i><b>}</b>
              This option determines the behavior of the overlay when,
              during a modification, it encounters dangling references.
              The default is <i>ignore</i>, which may leave dangling
              references.  Other options are <i>drop</i>, which discards those
              modifications that would result in dangling references,
              and <i>error</i>, which causes modifications that would result in
              dangling references to fail.

       <b>memberof-dangling-error </b><i>&lt;error-code&gt;</i>
              If <b>memberof-dangling </b>is set to <i>error</i>, this configuration
              parameter can be used to modify the response code returned
              in case of violation.  It defaults to "constraint
              violation", but other implementations are known to return
              "no such object" instead.

       <b>memberof-refint {</b><i>true</i><b>|</b><i>FALSE</i><b>}</b>
              This option determines whether the overlay will try to
              preserve referential integrity or not.  If set to <i>TRUE</i>,
              when an entry containing values of the "is member of"
              attribute is modified, the corresponding groups are
              modified as well.

       <b>memberof-addcheck {</b><i>true</i><b>|</b><i>FALSE</i><b>}</b>
              This option determines whether the overlay will check
              newly added entries for membership in any existing groups.
              This check is useful if populated groups are created in
              the directory before the entries they reference. The
              situation often occurs during replication, which may
              replicate entries in random order.  If set to <i>TRUE</i>, every
              Add operation will search for groups referencing the added
              entry and populate its memberof attribute with the group
              DNs. Note that <b>memberof-dangling </b>must be left on its
              default setting of <i>ignore</i> for this option to work.

       The memberof overlay may be used with any backend that provides
       full read-write functionality, but it is mainly intended for use
       with local storage backends. The maintenance operations it
       performs are internal to the server on which the overlay is
       configured and are never replicated. Consumer servers should be
       configured with their own instances of the memberOf overlay if it
       is desired to maintain these memberOf attributes on the
       consumers. Consumers must also be configured to exclude the
       <i>memberof</i> attribute from replication.  (See the <b>exattr </b>option in
       the consumer configuration.)

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       The memberof overlay has been reworked with the 2.5 release to
       use a consistent namespace as with other overlays. As a side-
       effect the following cn=config parameters are deprecated and will
       be removed in a future release: <b>olcMemberOf </b>is replaced with
       olcMemberOfConfig
