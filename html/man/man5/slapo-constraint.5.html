NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-constraint - Attribute Constraint Overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The constraint overlay is used to ensure that attribute values
       match some constraints beyond basic LDAP syntax.  Attributes can
       have multiple constraints placed upon them, and all must be
       satisfied when modifying an attribute value under constraint.

       This overlay is intended to be used to force syntactic regularity
       upon certain string represented data which have well known
       canonical forms, like telephone numbers, post codes, FQDNs, etc.

       It constrains only LDAP <i>add</i>, <i>modify</i> and <i>rename</i> commands and only
       seeks to control the <i>add</i> and <i>replace</i> values of <i>modify</i> and <i>rename</i>
       requests.

       No constraints are applied for operations performed with the
       <i>relax</i> control set.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       This <b>slapd.conf </b>option applies to the constraint overlay.  It
       should appear after the <b>overlay </b>directive.

       <b>constraint_attribute &lt;attribute_name&gt;[,...] &lt;type&gt; &lt;value&gt;</b>
       <b>[&lt;extra&gt; [...]]</b>
              Specifies the constraint which should apply to the comma-
              separated attribute list named as the first parameter.
              Six types of constraint are currently supported - <b>regex</b>,
              <b>negregex</b>, <b>size</b>, <b>count</b>, <b>uri</b>, and <b>set</b>.

              The parameter following the <b>regex </b>or <b>negregex </b>type is a
              Unix style regular expression (See <a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex(7)</a> ). The
              parameter following the <b>uri </b>type is an LDAP URI. The URI
              will be evaluated using an internal search.  It must not
              include a hostname, and it must include a list of
              attributes to evaluate.

              The parameter following the <b>set </b>type is a string that is
              interpreted according to the syntax in use for ACL sets.
              This allows one to construct constraints based on the
              contents of the entry.

              The <b>size </b>type can be used to enforce a limit on an
              attribute length, and the <b>count </b>type limits the number of
              values of an attribute.

              Extra parameters can occur in any order after those
              described above.

              <b>&lt;extra&gt; : restrict=&lt;uri&gt;</b>

              This extra parameter allows one to restrict the
              application of the corresponding constraint only to
              entries that match the <i>base</i>, <i>scope</i> and <i>filter</i> portions of
              the LDAP URI.  The <i>base</i>, if present, must be within the
              naming context of the database.  The <i>scope</i> is only used
              when the <i>base</i> is present; it defaults to <b>base</b>.  The other
              parameters of the URI are not allowed.

       Any attempt to add or modify an attribute named as part of the
       constraint overlay specification which does not fit the
       constraint listed will fail with a LDAP_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION
       error.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
              overlay constraint
              constraint_attribute jpegPhoto size 131072
              constraint_attribute userPassword count 3
              constraint_attribute mail regex ^[[:alnum:]]+@mydomain.com$
              constraint_attribute mail negregex ^[[:alnum:]]+@notallowed.com$
              constraint_attribute title uri
                ldap:///dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com?title?sub?(objectClass=titleCatalog)
              constraint_attribute cn,sn,givenName set
                "(this/givenName + [ ] + this/sn) &amp; this/cn"
                restrict="ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com??sub?(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)"

       A specification like the above would reject any <b>mail </b>attribute
       which did not look like <b>&lt;alphanumeric string&gt;@mydomain.com </b>or
       that looks like <b>&lt;alphanumeric string&gt;@notallowed.com</b>.  It would
       also reject any <b>title </b>attribute whose values were not listed in
       the <b>title </b>attribute of any <b>titleCatalog </b>entries in the given
       scope. (Note that the "dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com" subtree
       ought to reside in a separate database, otherwise the initial set
       of titleCatalog entries could not be populated while the
       constraint is in effect.)  Finally, it requires the values of the
       attribute <b>cn </b>to be constructed by pairing values of the
       attributes <b>sn </b>and <b>givenName</b>, separated by a space, but only for
       entries derived from the objectClass <b>inetOrgPerson</b>.
