NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpakrepo - Reference to a remote
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Flatpak uses flatpakrepo files to share information about
       remotes. The flatpakrepo file contains enough information to add
       the remote. Use the <b>flatpak remote-add --from </b>command to do so.

       flatpakrepo files may also contain additional information that is
       useful when displaying a remote to the user, e.g. in an app
       store.

       The filename extension commonly used for flatpakrepo files is
       .flatpakrepo.

       flatpakrepo files can also be placed in /etc/flatpak/remotes.d/
       to statically preconfigure system-wide remotes. Such files must
       use the .flatpakrepo extension.
</pre> <h2>
FILE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The flatpakrepo file is using the same .ini file format that is
       used for systemd unit files or application .desktop files.

   <b>[Flatpak Repo]</b>
       All the information is contained in the [Flatpak Repo] group.

       The following keys can be present in this group:

       <b>Version </b>(uint64)
           The version of the file format, must be 1 if present.

       <b>Url </b>(string)
           The url for the remote. This key is mandatory.

       <b>GPGKey </b>(string)
           The base64-encoded gpg key for the remote.

       <b>DefaultBranch </b>(string)
           The default branch to use for this remote.

       <b>Subset </b>(string)
           Limit the remote to the named subset of refs.

       <b>Title </b>(string)
           The title of the remote. This should be a user-friendly name
           that can be displayed e.g. in an app store.

       <b>Comment </b>(string)
           A short summary of the remote, for display e.g. in an app
           store.

       <b>Description </b>(string)
           A longer description of the remote, for display e.g. in an
           app store.

       <b>Icon </b>(string)
           The url for an icon that can be used to represent the remote.

       <b>Homepage </b>(string)
           The url of a webpage describing the remote.

       <b>Filter </b>(string)
           The path of a local file to use to filter remote refs. See
           <a href="../man1/flatpak-remote-add.1.html">flatpak-remote-add(1)</a> for details on the format of the file.

           Note: This field is treated a bit special by flatpak
           remote-add. If you install a remote with --if-not-exists then
           and the remote is already configured, then the filter field
           of the remote configuration will be update anyway. And, if
           the filter field is *not* specified then any existing filters
           are cleared. The goal here is to allow a pre-configured
           filtered remote to be replaced with the regular one if you
           add the normal upstream (unfiltered) flatpakrepo file.

       <b>DeploySideloadCollectionID </b>(string)
           The collection ID of the remote, if it has one. This uniquely
           identifies the collection of apps in the remote, to allow
           peer to peer redistribution (see <a href="../man1/flatpak.1.html">flatpak(1)</a>). It is
           recommended to use this key over DeployCollectionID or
           CollectionID because only newer clients (Flatpak 1.12.8 or
           later) pay attention to it (and older clients don't handle
           collection IDs properly).

       <b>DeployCollectionID </b>(string)
           This is deprecated but still supported for backwards
           compatibility. Use DeploySideloadCollectionID instead.

       <b>CollectionID </b>(string)
           This is deprecated but still supported for backwards
           compatibility. Use DeploySideloadCollectionID instead.
