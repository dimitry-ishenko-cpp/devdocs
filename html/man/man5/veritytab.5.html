NAME </h2>
<pre>
       veritytab - Configuration for verity block devices
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/veritytab
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The /etc/veritytab file describes verity protected block devices
       that are set up during system boot.

       Empty lines and lines starting with the "#" character are
       ignored. Each of the remaining lines describes one verity
       protected block device. Fields are delimited by white space.

       Each line is in the form

           <i>volume-name data-device hash-device roothash</i> [<i>options</i>]

       The first four fields are mandatory, the remaining one is
       optional.

       The first field contains the name of the resulting verity volume;
       its block device is set up below /dev/mapper/.

       The second field contains a path to the underlying block data
       device, or a specification of a block device via <i>UUID=</i> followed
       by the <i>UUID</i>.

       The third field contains a path to the underlying block hash
       device, or a specification of a block device via <i>UUID=</i> followed
       by the <i>UUID</i>.

       The fourth field is the <i>roothash</i> in hexadecimal.

       The fifth field, if present, is a comma-delimited list of
       options. The following options are recognized:

       <b>superblock=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Use dm-verity with or without permanent on-disk superblock.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>format=</b><i>NUMBER</i>
           Specifies the hash version type. Format type "0" is original
           Chrome OS version. Format type "1" is modern version.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>data-block-size=</b><i>BYTES</i>
           Used block size for the data device. (Note kernel supports
           only page-size as maximum here; Multiples of 512 bytes.)

           Added in version 254.

       <b>hash-block-size=</b><i>BYTES</i>
           Used block size for the hash device. (Note kernel supports
           only page-size as maximum here; Multiples of 512 bytes.)

           Added in version 254.

       <b>data-blocks=</b><i>BLOCKS</i>
           Number of blocks of data device used in verification. If not
           specified, the whole device is used.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>hash-offset=</b><i>BYTES</i>
           Offset of hash area/superblock on "hash-device". (Multiples
           of 512 bytes.)

           Added in version 254.

       <b>salt=</b><i>HEX</i>
           Salt used for format or verification. Format is a hexadecimal
           string; 256 bytes long maximum; "-" is the special value for
           empty.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>uuid=</b><i>UUID</i>
           Use the provided <i>UUID</i> instead of generating new one. The <i>UUID</i>
           must be provided in standard UUID format, e.g.
           "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc".

           Added in version 254.

       <b>ignore-corruption</b>, <b>restart-on-corruption</b>, <b>panic-on-corruption</b>
           Defines what to do if a data verity problem is detected (data
           corruption). Without these options kernel fails the IO
           operation with I/O error. With <b>--ignore-corruption </b>option the
           corruption is only logged. With <b>--restart-on-corruption </b>or
           <b>--panic-on-corruption </b>the kernel is restarted (panicked)
           immediately. (You have to provide way how to avoid restart
           loops.)

           Added in version 248.

       <b>ignore-zero-blocks</b>
           Instruct kernel to not verify blocks that are expected to
           contain zeroes and always directly return zeroes instead.

               <b>Warning</b>
               Use this option only in very specific cases. This option
               is available since Linux kernel version 4.5.
           Added in version 248.

       <b>check-at-most-once</b>
           Instruct kernel to verify blocks only the first time they are
           read from the data device, rather than every time.

               <b>Warning</b>
               It provides a reduced level of security because only
               offline tampering of the data device's content will be
               detected, not online tampering. This option is available
               since Linux kernel version 4.17.
           Added in version 248.

       <b>hash=</b><i>HASH</i>
           Hash algorithm for dm-verity. This should be the name of the
           algorithm, like "sha1". For default see <b>veritysetup --help</b>.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>fec-device=</b><i>PATH</i>
           Use forward error correction (FEC) to recover from corruption
           if hash verification fails. Use encoding data from the
           specified device. The fec device argument can be block device
           or file image. If fec device path doesn't exist, it will be
           created as file. Note: block sizes for data and hash devices
           must match. Also, if the verity data_device is encrypted the
           fec_device should be too.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>fec-offset=</b><i>BYTES</i>
           This is the offset, in bytes, from the start of the FEC
           device to the beginning of the encoding data. (Aligned on 512
           bytes.)

           Added in version 254.

       <b>fec-roots=</b><i>NUM</i>
           Number of generator roots. This equals to the number of
           parity bytes in the encoding data. In RS(M, N) encoding, the
           number of roots is M-N. M is 255 and M-N is between 2 and 24
           (including).

           Added in version 254.

       <b>root-hash-signature=</b><i>PATH</i><b>|base64:</b><i>HEX</i>
           A base64 string encoding the root hash signature prefixed by
           "base64:" or a path to roothash signature file used to verify
           the root hash (in kernel). This feature requires Linux kernel
           version 5.4 or more recent.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>_netdev</b>
           Marks this veritysetup device as requiring network. It will
           be started after the network is available, similarly to
           <a href="systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount(5)</a> units marked with <b>_netdev</b>. The service unit
           to set up this device will be ordered between
           remote-fs-pre.target and remote-veritysetup.target, instead
           of veritysetup-pre.target and veritysetup.target.

           Hint: if this device is used for a mount point that is
           specified in <a href="fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a>, the <b>_netdev </b>option should also be used
           for the mount point. Otherwise, a dependency loop might be
           created where the mount point will be pulled in by
           local-fs.target, while the service to configure the network
           is usually only started <i>after</i> the local file system has been
           mounted.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>noauto</b>
           This device will not be added to veritysetup.target. This
           means that it will not be automatically enabled on boot,
           unless something else pulls it in. In particular, if the
           device is used for a mount point, it'll be enabled
           automatically during boot, unless the mount point itself is
           also disabled with <b>noauto</b>.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>nofail</b>
           This device will not be a hard dependency of
           veritysetup.target. It'll still be pulled in and started, but
           the system will not wait for the device to show up and be
           enabled, and boot will not fail if this is unsuccessful. Note
           that other units that depend on the enabled device may still
           fail. In particular, if the device is used for a mount point,
           the mount point itself also needs to have the <b>nofail </b>option,
           or the boot will fail if the device is not enabled
           successfully.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>x-initrd.attach</b>
           Setup this verity protected block device in the initrd,
           similarly to <a href="systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount(5)</a> units marked with
           <b>x-initrd.mount</b>.

           Although it's not necessary to mark the mount entry for the
           root file system with <b>x-initrd.mount</b>, <b>x-initrd.attach </b>is
           still recommended with the verity protected block device
           containing the root file system as otherwise systemd will
           attempt to detach the device during the regular system
           shutdown while it's still in use. With this option the device
           will still be detached but later after the root file system
           is unmounted.

           All other verity protected block devices that contain file
           systems mounted in the initrd should use this option.

           Added in version 248.

       At early boot and when the system manager configuration is
       reloaded, this file is translated into native systemd units by
       <a href="../man8/systemd-veritysetup-generator.8.html">systemd-veritysetup-generator(8)</a>.
