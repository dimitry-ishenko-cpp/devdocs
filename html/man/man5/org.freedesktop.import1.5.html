NAME </h2>
<pre>
       org.freedesktop.import1 - The D-Bus interface of systemd-importd
</pre> <h2>
INTRODUCTION </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="../man8/systemd-importd.service.8.html">systemd-importd.service(8)</a> is a system service which may be used
       to import, export and download disk images. These images can be
       used by tools such as <a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a> to run local containers.
       The service is used as the backend for <b>importctl pull-raw</b>,
       <b>importctl pull-tar </b>and related commands. This page describes the
       D-Bus interface.

       Note that <a href="../man8/systemd-importd.service.8.html">systemd-importd.service(8)</a> is mostly a small companion
       service for <a href="../man8/systemd-machined.service.8.html">systemd-machined.service(8)</a>. Many operations to
       manipulate local container and VM images are hence available via
       the <b>systemd-machined </b>D-Bus API, c.f.

THE MANAGER OBJECT </h2>
<pre>
       The service exposes the following interfaces on the Manager
       object on the bus:

           node /org/freedesktop/import1 {
             interface org.freedesktop.import1.Manager {
               methods:
                 ImportTar(in  h fd,
                           in  s local_name,

   <b>Methods</b>
       <b>ImportTar()</b>/<b>ImportTarEx() </b>and <b>ImportRaw()</b>/<b>ImportRawEx() </b>import a
       disk image and place it into the image directory. The first
       argument should be a file descriptor (opened for reading)
       referring to the tar or raw file to import. It should reference a
       file on disk, a pipe or a socket. When <b>ImportTar()</b>/<b>ImportTarEx()</b>
       is used the file descriptor should refer to a tar file,
       optionally compressed with <b>gzip</b>(1), <b>bzip2</b>(1), or <b>xz</b>(1).
       <b>systemd-importd </b>will detect the used compression scheme (if any)
       automatically. When <b>ImportRaw()</b>/<b>ImportRawEx() </b>is used the file
       descriptor should refer to a raw or qcow2 disk image containing
       an MBR or GPT disk label, also optionally compressed with gzip,
       bzip2 or xz. In either case, if the file is specified as a file
       descriptor on disk, progress information is generated for the
       import operation (as in that case we know the total size on
       disk). If a socket or pipe is specified, progress information is
       not available. The file descriptor argument is followed by a
       local name for the image. This should be a name suitable as a
       hostname and will be used to name the imported image below
       /var/lib/machines/. A tar import is placed as a directory tree or
       a <a href="../man8/btrfs.8.html">btrfs(8)</a> subvolume below the image directory under the
       specified name with no suffix appended. A raw import is placed as
       a file in the image directory with the .raw suffix appended. In
       case of <b>ImportTar()</b>/<b>ImportRaw()</b>, if the <b>force </b>argument is true,
       any pre-existing image with the same name is removed before
       starting the operation. Otherwise, the operation fails if an
       image with the same name already exists. The <b>read_only </b>argument
       controls whether to create a writable or read-only image. In case
       of <b>ImportTarEx()</b>/<b>ImportRawEx() </b>these boolean flags are provided
       via a 64bit flags parameter instead, with bit 0 mapping to the
       <b>force </b>parameter, and bit 1 mapping to <b>read_only</b>. The <b>class</b>
       parameter specifies the image class, and takes one of "machine",
       "portable", "sysext", "confext". All four methods return
       immediately after starting the import, with the import transfer
       ongoing. They return a pair of transfer identifier and object
       path, which may be used to retrieve progress information about
       the transfer or to cancel it. The transfer identifier is a simple
       numeric identifier, the object path references an
       org.freedesktop.import1.Transfer object, see below. Listen for a
       <b>TransferRemoved() </b>signal for the transfer ID in order to detect
       when a transfer is complete. The returned transfer object is
       useful to determine the current progress or log output of the
       ongoing import operation.

       <b>ExportTar()</b>/<b>ExportTarEx() </b>and <b>ExportRaw()</b>/<b>ExportRaw() </b>implement
       the reverse operation, and may be used to export a system image
       in order to place it in a tar or raw image. They take the machine
       name to export as their first parameter, followed by a file
       descriptor (opened for writing) where the tar or raw file will be
       written. It may either reference a file on disk or a pipe/socket.
       The third argument specifies in which compression format to write
       the image. It takes one of "uncompressed", "xz", "bzip2" or
       "gzip", depending on which compression scheme is required. The
       image written to the specified file descriptor will be a tar file
       in case of <b>ExportTar()</b>/<b>ExportTarEx() </b>or a raw disk image in case
       of <b>ExportRaw()</b>/<b>ExportRawEx()</b>. Note that currently raw disk images
       may not be exported as tar files, and vice versa. This
       restriction might be lifted eventually. The method returns a
       transfer identifier and object path for cancelling or tracking
       the export operation, similarly to <b>ImportTar()</b>/<b>ImportTarEx() </b>or
       <b>ImportRaw()</b>/<b>ImportRawEx() </b>as described above.
       <b>ExportTarEx()</b>/<b>ExportRawEx() </b>expect the image class as additional
       parameter, as well as a 64bit flags parameter that currently must
       be specified as zero.

       <b>PullTar()</b>/<b>PullTarEx() </b>and <b>PullRaw()</b>/<b>PullRawEx() </b>may be used to
       download, verify and import a system image from a URL. They take
       a URL argument which should point to a tar or raw file on the
       "http://" or "https://" protocols, possibly compressed with xz,
       bzip2 or gzip. The second argument is a local name for the image.
       It should be suitable as a hostname, similarly to the matching
       argument of the <b>ImportTar()</b>/<b>ImportTarEx() </b>and
       <b>ImportRaw()</b>/<b>ImportRawEx() </b>methods above. The third argument
       indicates the verification mode for the image. It may be one of
       "no", "checksum", "signature".  "no" turns off any kind of
       verification of the image; "checksum" looks for a SHA256SUM file
       next to the downloaded image and verifies any SHA256 hash value
       in that file against the image; "signature" does the same but
       also tries to authenticate the SHA256SUM file via <b>gpg</b>(8) first.
       In case of <b>PullTar()</b>/<b>PullRaw() </b>the last argument indicates
       whether to replace a possibly pre-existing image with the same
       local name (if "true"), or whether to fail (if "false"). In case
       of <b>PullTarEx()</b>/<b>PullRawEx() </b>the last argument is a 64bit flags
       parameter, where bit 0 controls the "force" flag, bit 1 is a
       "read_only" flag that controls whether the created image shall be
       marked read-only, and bit 2 is a "keep_download" flag that
       indicates whether a pristine, read-only copy of the downloaded
       image shell be kept, in addition for the local copy of the image.
       The <b>..._Ex() </b>variants also expect an image class string (as
       above). Like the import and export calls above, these calls
       return a pair of transfer identifier and object path for the
       ongoing download.

       <b>ImportFileSystem()</b>/<b>ImportFileSystemEx() </b>are similar to
       <b>ImportTar()</b>/<b>ImportTarEx() </b>but import a directory tree. The first
       argument must refer to a directory file descriptor for the source
       hierarchy to import.

       <b>ListTransfers()</b>/<b>ListTransfersEx() </b>return a list of ongoing
       import, export or download operations as created with the six
       calls described above. They return an array of structures which
       consist of the numeric transfer identifier, a string indicating
       the operation (one of "import-tar", "import-raw", "export-tar",
       "export-raw", "pull-tar" or "pull-raw"), a string describing the
       remote file (in case of download operations this is the source
       URL, in case of import/export operations this is a short string
       describing the file descriptor passed in), a string with the
       local machine image name, the image class (only in case of
       <b>ListTransfersEx()</b>; one of "machine", "portable", "sysext",
       "confext"), a progress value between 0.0 (for 0%) and 1.0 (for
       100%), as well as the transfer object path.

       <b>CancelTransfer() </b>may be used to cancel an ongoing import, export
       or download operation. Simply specify the transfer identifier to
       cancel the ongoing operation.

       <b>ListImages() </b>returns a list of currently installed images. It
       takes a image class string and a flags parameter. The image class
       is either the empty string or specifies one of the four image
       classes, by which it will then filter. The flags parameter must
       be zero at this time. It returns an array of items, each
       describing one image. The item fields are in order: the image
       class, the local image name, the image type, the image path, the
       read-only flag, the creation and modification times (in
       microseconds since the UNIX epoch), as well as the current disk
       usage in bytes (both overall, and exclusive), as well as any size
       limit in bytes set on the image (both overall and exclusive).

   <b>Signals</b>
       The <b>TransferNew() </b>signal is generated each time a new transfer is
       started with the import, export or download calls described
       above. It carries the transfer ID and object path that have just
       been created.

       The <b>TransferRemoved() </b>signal is sent each time a transfer
       finishes, is canceled or fails. It also carries the transfer ID
       and object path, followed by a string indicating the result of
       the operation, which is one of "done" (on success), "canceled" or
       "failed".

             interface org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties { ... };
           };

   <b>Methods</b>
       The <b>Cancel() </b>method may be used to cancel the transfer. It takes
       no parameters. This method is pretty much equivalent to the
       <b>CancelTransfer() </b>method on the Manager interface (see above), but
       is exposed on the Transfer object itself instead of taking a
       transfer ID.

   <b>Properties</b>
       The <i>Id</i> property exposes the numeric transfer ID of the transfer
       object.

       The <i>Local</i>, <i>Remote</i> and <i>Type</i> properties expose the local container
       name of this transfer, the remote source (in case of download:
       the URL, in case of import/export: a string describing the file
       descriptor passed in), and the type of operation (see the
       Manager's <b>ListTransfer() </b>method above for an explanation of the
       possible values).

       The <i>Verify</i> property exposes the selected verification setting and
       is only defined for download operations (see above).

       The <i>Progress</i> property exposes the current progress of the
       transfer as a value between 0.0 and 1.0. To show a progress bar
       on screen we recommend to query this value in regular intervals,
       for example every 500 ms or so.

   <b>Signals</b>
       The <b>LogMessage() </b>signal is emitted for log messages generated by
       a transfer. It carries a pair of syslog log level integer and log
       string.

       The <b>ProgressUpdate() </b>signal is emitted in regular intervals when
       new download progress information is available for a transfer. It
       carries a double precision floating pointer number between 0.0
       and 1.0 indicating the transfer progress.
