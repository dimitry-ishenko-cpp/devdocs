NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapd.access - access configuration for slapd, the stand-alone
       LDAP daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> file contains configuration information for the
       <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> daemon. This configuration file is also used by the
       SLAPD tools <a href="../man8/slapacl.8.html">slapacl(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapadd.8.html">slapadd(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapauth.8.html">slapauth(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapcat.8.html">slapcat(8)</a>,
       <a href="../man8/slapdn.8.html">slapdn(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapindex.8.html">slapindex(8)</a>, <a href="../man8/slapmodify.8.html">slapmodify(8)</a>, and <a href="../man8/slaptest.8.html">slaptest(8)</a>.

       The <b>slapd.conf </b>file consists of a series of global configuration
       options that apply to <b>slapd </b>as a whole (including all backends),
       followed by zero or more database backend definitions that
       contain information specific to a backend instance.

       The general format of <b>slapd.conf </b>is as follows:

           # comment - these options apply to every database
           &lt;global configuration options&gt;
           # first database definition &amp; configuration options
           database    &lt;backend 1 type&gt;
           &lt;configuration options specific to backend 1&gt;
           # subsequent database definitions &amp; configuration options
           ...

       Both the global configuration and each backend-specific section
       can contain access information.  Backend-specific access control
       directives are used for those entries that belong to the backend,
       according to their naming context.  In case no access control
       directives are defined for a backend or those which are defined
       are not applicable, the directives from the global configuration
       section are then used.

       If no access controls are present, the default policy allows
       anyone and everyone to read anything but restricts updates to
       rootdn.  (e.g., "access to * by * read").

       When dealing with an access list, because the global access list
       is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the
       resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an
       implicit <b>access to * by * none </b>directive. If there are no access
       directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

       <b>Be warned: the rootdn can always read and write EVERYTHING!</b>

       For entries not held in any backend (such as a root DSE), the
       global directives are used.

       Arguments that should be replaced by actual text are shown in
       brackets &lt;&gt;.
</pre> <h2>
THE ACCESS DIRECTIVE </h2>
<pre>
       The structure of the access control directives is

       <b>access to &lt;what&gt; [ by &lt;who&gt; [ &lt;access&gt; ] [ &lt;control&gt; ] ]+</b>
              Grant access (specified by <b>&lt;access&gt;</b>) to a set of entries
              and/or attributes (specified by <b>&lt;what&gt;</b>) by one or more
              requestors (specified by <b>&lt;who&gt;</b>).

       Lists of access directives are evaluated in the order they appear
       in <i>slapd.conf</i>.  When a <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>clause matches the datum whose
       access is being evaluated, its <b>&lt;who&gt; </b>clause list is checked.
       When a <b>&lt;who&gt; </b>clause matches the accessor's properties, its
       <b>&lt;access&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;control&gt; </b>clauses are evaluated.

       Access control checking stops at the first match of the <b>&lt;what&gt;</b>
       and <b>&lt;who&gt; </b>clause, unless otherwise dictated by the <b>&lt;control&gt;</b>
       clause.  Each <b>&lt;who&gt; </b>clause list is implicitly terminated by a

            by * none stop

       <b>&lt;control&gt; </b>clause.  This implicit <b>&lt;control&gt; </b>stops access directive
       evaluation with no more access privileges granted to anyone else.
       To stop access directive evaluation only when both <b>&lt;who&gt; </b>and
       <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>match, add an explicit

            by * break

       to the end of the <b>&lt;who&gt; </b>clause list.

       Each <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>clause list is implicitly terminated by a

            access to *
                 by * none

       clause that results in granting no access privileges to an
       otherwise unspecified datum.
</pre> <h2>
THE &lt;WHAT&gt; FIELD </h2>
<pre>
       The field <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>specifies the entity the access control
       directive applies to.  It can have the forms

            dn[.&lt;dnstyle&gt;]=&lt;dnpattern&gt;
            filter=&lt;ldapfilter&gt;
            attrs=&lt;attrlist&gt;[ val[/matchingRule][.&lt;attrstyle&gt;]=&lt;attrval&gt;]

       with

            &lt;dnstyle&gt;={{exact|base(object)}|regex
                 |one(level)|sub(tree)|children}
            &lt;attrlist&gt;={&lt;attr&gt;|[{!|@}]&lt;objectClass&gt;}[,&lt;attrlist&gt;]
            &lt;attrstyle&gt;={{exact|base(object)}|regex
                 |one(level)|sub(tree)|children}

       The statement <b>dn=&lt;dnpattern&gt; </b>selects the entries based on their
       naming context.  The <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt; </b>is a string representation of
       the entry's DN.  The wildcard <b>* </b>stands for all the entries, and
       it is implied if no <b>dn </b>form is given.

       The <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt; </b>is optional; however, it is recommended to specify
       it to avoid ambiguities.  <b>Base </b>(synonym of <b>baseObject</b>), the
       default, or <b>exact </b>(an alias of <b>base</b>) indicates the entry whose DN
       is equal to the <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b>; <b>one </b>(synonym of <b>onelevel</b>) indicates
       all the entries immediately below the <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b>, <b>sub </b>(synonym
       of <b>subtree</b>) indicates all entries in the subtree at the
       <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b>, <b>children </b>indicates all the entries below
       (subordinate to) the <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b>.

       If the <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt; </b>qualifier is <b>regex</b>, then <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt; </b>is a POSIX
       (''extended'') regular expression pattern, as detailed in
       <a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex(7)</a> and/or <b>re_format</b>(7), matching a normalized string
       representation of the entry's DN.  The regex form of the pattern
       does not (yet) support UTF-8.

       The statement <b>filter=&lt;ldapfilter&gt; </b>selects the entries based on a
       valid LDAP filter as described in RFC 4515.  A filter of
       <b>(objectClass=*) </b>is implied if no <b>filter </b>form is given.

       The statement <b>attrs=&lt;attrlist&gt; </b>selects the attributes the access
       control rule applies to.  It is a comma-separated list of
       attribute types, plus the special names <b>entry</b>, indicating access
       to the entry itself, and <b>children</b>, indicating access to the
       entry's children. ObjectClass names may also be specified in this
       list, which will affect all the attributes that are required
       and/or allowed by that objectClass.  Actually, names in
       <b>&lt;attrlist&gt; </b>that are prefixed by <b>@ </b>are directly treated as
       objectClass names.  A name prefixed by <b>!  </b>is also treated as an
       objectClass, but in this case the access rule affects the
       attributes that are not required nor allowed by that objectClass.
       If no <b>attrs </b>form is given, <b>attrs=@extensibleObject </b>is implied,
       i.e. all attributes are addressed.

       Using the form <b>attrs=&lt;attr&gt;</b>
       <b>val[/matchingRule][.&lt;attrstyle&gt;]=&lt;attrval&gt; </b>specifies access to a
       particular value of a single attribute.  In this case, only a
       single attribute type may be given. The <b>&lt;attrstyle&gt; exact </b>(the
       default) uses the attribute's equality matching rule to compare
       the value, unless a different (and compatible) matching rule is
       specified. If the <b>&lt;attrstyle&gt; </b>is <b>regex</b>, the provided value is
       used as a POSIX (''extended'') regular expression pattern.  If
       the attribute has DN syntax, the <b>&lt;attrstyle&gt; </b>can be any of <b>base</b>,
       <b>onelevel</b>, <b>subtree </b>or <b>children</b>, resulting in base, onelevel,
       subtree or children match, respectively.

       The dn, filter, and attrs statements are additive; they can be
       used in sequence to select entities the access rule applies to
       based on naming context, value and attribute type simultaneously.
       Submatches resulting from <b>regex </b>matching can be dereferenced in
       the <b>&lt;who&gt; </b>field using the syntax <i>${v&lt;n&gt;}</i>, where <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> is the
       submatch number.  The default syntax, <i>$&lt;n&gt;</i>, is actually an alias
       for <i>${d&lt;n&gt;}</i>, that corresponds to dereferencing submatches from
       the <b>dnpattern </b>portion of the <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>field.
</pre> <h2>
THE &lt;WHO&gt; FIELD </h2>
<pre>
       The field <b>&lt;who&gt; </b>indicates whom the access rules apply to.
       Multiple <b>&lt;who&gt; </b>statements can appear in an access control
       statement, indicating the different access privileges to the same
       resource that apply to different accessee.  It can have the forms

            *
            anonymous
            users
            self[.&lt;selfstyle&gt;]

            dn[.&lt;dnstyle&gt;[,&lt;modifier&gt;]]=&lt;DN&gt;
            dnattr=&lt;attrname&gt;

            realanonymous
            realusers
            realself[.&lt;selfstyle&gt;]

            realdn[.&lt;dnstyle&gt;[,&lt;modifier&gt;]]=&lt;DN&gt;
            realdnattr=&lt;attrname&gt;

            group[/&lt;objectclass&gt;[/&lt;attrname&gt;]]
                 [.&lt;groupstyle&gt;]=&lt;group&gt;
            peername[.&lt;peernamestyle&gt;]=&lt;peername&gt;
            sockname[.&lt;style&gt;]=&lt;sockname&gt;
            domain[.&lt;domainstyle&gt;[,&lt;modifier&gt;]]=&lt;domain&gt;
            sockurl[.&lt;style&gt;]=&lt;sockurl&gt;
            set[.&lt;setstyle&gt;]=&lt;pattern&gt;

            ssf=&lt;n&gt;
            transport_ssf=&lt;n&gt;
            tls_ssf=&lt;n&gt;
            sasl_ssf=&lt;n&gt;

            dynacl/&lt;name&gt;[/&lt;options&gt;][.&lt;dynstyle&gt;][=&lt;pattern&gt;]

       with

            &lt;style&gt;={exact|regex|expand}
            &lt;selfstyle&gt;={level{&lt;n&gt;}}
            &lt;dnstyle&gt;={{exact|base(object)}|regex
                 |one(level)|sub(tree)|children|level{&lt;n&gt;}}
            &lt;groupstyle&gt;={exact|expand}
            &lt;peernamestyle&gt;={&lt;style&gt;|ip|ipv6|path}
            &lt;domainstyle&gt;={exact|regex|sub(tree)}
            &lt;setstyle&gt;={exact|expand}
            &lt;modifier&gt;={expand}
            &lt;name&gt;=aci          &lt;pattern&gt;=&lt;attrname&gt;]

       They may be specified in combination.

       The wildcard <b>* </b>refers to everybody.

       The keywords prefixed by <b>real </b>act as their counterparts without
       prefix; the checking respectively occurs with the <i>authentication</i>
       DN and the <i>authorization</i> DN.

       The keyword <b>anonymous </b>means access is granted to unauthenticated
       clients; it is mostly used to limit access to authentication
       resources (e.g. the <b>userPassword </b>attribute) to unauthenticated
       clients for authentication purposes.

       The keyword <b>users </b>means access is granted to authenticated
       clients.

       The keyword <b>self </b>means access to an entry is allowed to the entry
       itself (e.g. the entry being accessed and the requesting entry
       must be the same).  It allows the <b>level{&lt;n&gt;} </b>style, where <i>&lt;n&gt;</i>
       indicates what ancestor of the DN is to be used in matches.  A
       positive value indicates that the &lt;n&gt;-th ancestor of the user's
       DN is to be considered; a negative value indicates that the
       &lt;n&gt;-th ancestor of the target is to be considered.  For example,
       a "<i>by self.level{1} ...</i>" clause would match when the object
       "<i>dc=example,dc=com</i>" is accessed by "<i>cn=User,dc=example,dc=com</i>".
       A "<i>by self.level{-1} ...</i>" clause would match when the same user
       accesses the object "<i>ou=Address Book,cn=User,dc=example,dc=com</i>".

       The statement <b>dn=&lt;DN&gt; </b>means that access is granted to the
       matching DN.  The optional style qualifier <b>dnstyle </b>allows the
       same choices of the dn form of the <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>field.  In addition,
       the <b>regex </b>style can exploit substring substitution of submatches
       in the <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>dn.regex clause by using the form <b>$&lt;digit&gt;</b>, with
       <b>digit </b>ranging from 0 to 9 (where 0 matches the entire string), or
       the form <b>${&lt;digit&gt;+}</b>, for submatches higher than 9.  Substring
       substitution from attribute value can be done in using the form
       <b>${v&lt;digit&gt;+}</b>.  Since the dollar character is used to indicate a
       substring replacement, the dollar character that is used to
       indicate match up to the end of the string must be escaped by a
       second dollar character, e.g.

           access to dn.regex="^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),dc=[^,]+,dc=com$"
               by dn.regex="^uid=$2,dc=[^,]+,dc=com$$" write

       The style qualifier allows an optional <b>modifier</b>.  At present, the
       only type allowed is <b>expand</b>, which causes substring substitution
       of submatches to take place even if <b>dnstyle </b>is not <b>regex</b>.  Note
       that the <b>regex </b>dnstyle in the above example may be of use only if
       the <b>&lt;by&gt; </b>clause needs to be a regex; otherwise, if the value of
       the second (from the right) <b>dc= </b>portion of the DN in the above
       example were fixed, the form

           access to dn.regex="^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),dc=example,dc=com$"
               by dn.exact,expand="uid=$2,dc=example,dc=com" write

       could be used; if it had to match the value in the <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>clause,
       the form

           access to dn.regex="^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),dc=([^,]+),dc=com$"
               by dn.exact,expand="uid=$2,dc=$3,dc=com" write

       could be used.

       Forms of the <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>clause other than regex may provide
       submatches as well.  The <b>base(object)</b>, the <b>sub(tree)</b>, the
       <b>one(level)</b>, and the <b>children </b>forms provide <b>$0 </b>as the match of the
       entire string.  The <b>sub(tree)</b>, the <b>one(level)</b>, and the <b>children</b>
       forms also provide <b>$1 </b>as the match of the rightmost part of the
       DN as defined in the <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>clause.  This may be useful, for
       instance, to provide access to all the ancestors of a user by
       defining

           access to dn.subtree="dc=com"
               by dn.subtree,expand="$1" read

       which means that only access to entries that appear in the DN of
       the <b>&lt;by&gt; </b>clause is allowed.

       The <b>level{&lt;n&gt;} </b>form is an extension and a generalization of the
       <b>onelevel </b>form, which matches all DNs whose &lt;n&gt;-th ancestor is the
       pattern.  So, <i>level{1}</i> is equivalent to <i>onelevel</i>, and <i>level{0}</i> is
       equivalent to <i>base</i>.

       It is perfectly useless to give any access privileges to a DN
       that exactly matches the <b>rootdn </b>of the database the ACLs apply
       to, because it implicitly possesses write privileges for the
       entire tree of that database.  Actually, access control is
       bypassed for the <b>rootdn</b>, to solve the intrinsic chicken-and-egg
       problem.

       The statement <b>dnattr=&lt;attrname&gt; </b>means that access is granted to
       requests whose DN is listed in the entry being accessed under the
       <b>&lt;attrname&gt; </b>attribute.

       The statement <b>group=&lt;group&gt; </b>means that access is granted to
       requests whose DN is listed in the group entry whose DN is given
       by <b>&lt;group&gt;</b>.  The optional parameters <b>&lt;objectclass&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;attrname&gt;</b>
       define the objectClass and the member attributeType of the group
       entry.  The defaults are <b>groupOfNames </b>and <b>member</b>, respectively.
       The optional style qualifier <b>&lt;style&gt; </b>can be <b>expand</b>, which means
       that <b>&lt;group&gt; </b>will be expanded as a replacement string (but not as
       a regular expression) according to <a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex(7)</a> and/or <b>re_format</b>(7),
       and <b>exact</b>, which means that exact match will be used.  If the
       style of the DN portion of the <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>clause is regex, the
       submatches are made available according to <a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex(7)</a> and/or
       <b>re_format</b>(7); other styles provide limited submatches as
       discussed above about the DN form of the <b>&lt;by&gt; </b>clause.

       For static groups, the specified attributeType must have
       <b>DistinguishedName </b>or <b>NameAndOptionalUID </b>syntax. For dynamic
       groups the attributeType must be a subtype of the <b>labeledURI</b>
       attributeType. Only LDAP URIs of the form
       <b>ldap:///&lt;base&gt;??&lt;scope&gt;?&lt;filter&gt; </b>will be evaluated in a dynamic
       group, by searching the local server only.

       The statements <b>peername=&lt;peername&gt;</b>, <b>sockname=&lt;sockname&gt;</b>,
       <b>domain=&lt;domain&gt;</b>, and <b>sockurl=&lt;sockurl&gt; </b>mean that the contacting
       host IP (in the form <b>IP=&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt; </b>for IPv4, or
       <b>IP=[&lt;ipv6&gt;]:&lt;port&gt; </b>for IPv6) or the contacting host named pipe
       file name (in the form <b>PATH=&lt;path&gt; </b>if connecting through a named
       pipe) for <b>peername</b>, the named pipe file name for <b>sockname</b>, the
       contacting host name for <b>domain</b>, and the contacting URL for
       <b>sockurl </b>are compared against <b>pattern </b>to determine access.  The
       same <b>style </b>rules for pattern match described for the <b>group </b>case
       apply, plus the <b>regex </b>style, which implies submatch <b>expand </b>and
       regex match of the corresponding connection parameters.  The
       <b>exact </b>style of the <b>&lt;peername&gt; </b>clause (the default) implies a
       case-exact match on the client's <b>IP</b>, including the <b>IP= </b>prefix and
       the trailing <b>:&lt;port&gt;</b>, or the client's <b>path</b>, including the <b>PATH=</b>
       prefix if connecting through a named pipe.  The special <b>ip </b>style
       interprets the pattern as <b>&lt;peername&gt;=&lt;ip&gt;[%&lt;mask&gt;][{&lt;n&gt;}]</b>, where
       <b>&lt;ip&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;mask&gt; </b>are dotted digit representations of the IP and
       the mask, while <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>, delimited by curly brackets, is an optional
       port.  The same applies to IPv6 addresses when the special <b>ipv6</b>
       style is used.  When checking access privileges, the IP portion
       of the <b>peername </b>is extracted, eliminating the <b>IP= </b>prefix and the
       <b>:&lt;port&gt; </b>part, and it is compared against the <b>&lt;ip&gt; </b>portion of the
       pattern after masking with <b>&lt;mask&gt;</b>: <i>((peername &amp; &lt;mask&gt;) == &lt;ip&gt;)</i>.
       As an example, <b>peername.ip=127.0.0.1 </b>and <b>peername.ipv6=::1 </b>allow
       connections only from localhost,
       <b>peername.ip=192.168.1.0%255.255.255.0 </b>allows connections from any
       IP in the 192.168.1 class C domain, and
       <b>peername.ip=192.168.1.16%255.255.255.240{9009} </b>allows connections
       from any IP in the 192.168.1.[16-31] range of the same domain,
       only if port 9009 is used.  The special <b>path </b>style eliminates the
       <b>PATH= </b>prefix from the <b>peername </b>when connecting through a named
       pipe, and performs an exact match on the given pattern.  The
       <b>&lt;domain&gt; </b>clause also allows the <b>subtree </b>style, which succeeds
       when a fully qualified name exactly matches the <b>domain </b>pattern,
       or its trailing part, after a <b>dot</b>, exactly matches the <b>domain</b>
       pattern.  The <b>expand </b>style is allowed, implying an <b>exact </b>match
       with submatch expansion; the use of <b>expand </b>as a style modifier is
       considered more appropriate.  As an example,
       <b>domain.subtree=example.com </b>will match www.example.com, but will
       not match www.anotherexample.com.  The <b>domain </b>of the contacting
       host is determined by performing a DNS reverse lookup.  As this
       lookup can easily be spoofed, use of the <b>domain </b>statement is
       strongly discouraged.  By default, reverse lookups are disabled.
       The optional <b>domainstyle </b>qualifier of the <b>&lt;domain&gt; </b>clause allows
       a <b>modifier </b>option; the only value currently supported is <b>expand</b>,
       which causes substring substitution of submatches to take place
       even if the <b>domainstyle </b>is not <b>regex</b>, much like the analogous
       usage in <b>&lt;dn&gt; </b>clause.

       The statement <b>set=&lt;pattern&gt; </b>is undocumented yet.

       The statement <b>dynacl/&lt;name&gt;[/&lt;options&gt;][.&lt;dynstyle&gt;][=&lt;pattern&gt;]</b>
       means that access checking is delegated to the admin-defined
       method indicated by <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>, which can be registered at run-time
       by means of the <b>moduleload </b>statement.  The fields <b>&lt;options&gt;</b>,
       <b>&lt;dynstyle&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;pattern&gt; </b>are optional, and are directly passed to
       the registered parsing routine.  Dynacl is experimental; it must
       be enabled at compile time.

       The statement <b>dynacl/aci[=&lt;attrname&gt;] </b>means that the access
       control is determined by the values in the <b>attrname </b>of the entry
       itself.  The optional <b>&lt;attrname&gt; </b>indicates what attributeType
       holds the ACI information in the entry.  By default, the
       <b>OpenLDAPaci </b>operational attribute is used.  ACIs are
       experimental; they must be enabled at compile time.

       The statements <b>ssf=&lt;n&gt;</b>, <b>transport_ssf=&lt;n&gt;</b>, <b>tls_ssf=&lt;n&gt;</b>, and
       <b>sasl_ssf=&lt;n&gt; </b>set the minimum required Security Strength Factor
       (ssf) needed to grant access.  The value should be positive
       integer.
</pre> <h2>
THE &lt;ACCESS&gt; FIELD </h2>
<pre>
       The optional field <b>&lt;access&gt; ::= [[real]self]{&lt;level&gt;|&lt;priv&gt;}</b>
       determines the access level or the specific access privileges the
       <b>who </b>field will have.  Its component are defined as

            &lt;level&gt; ::= none|disclose|auth|compare|search|read|{write|add|delete}|manage
            &lt;priv&gt; ::= {=|+|-}{0|d|x|c|s|r|{w|a|z}|m}+

       The modifier <b>self </b>allows special operations like having a certain
       access level or privilege only in case the operation involves the
       name of the user that's requesting the access.  It implies the
       user that requests access is authorized.  The modifier <b>realself</b>
       refers to the authenticated DN as opposed to the authorized DN of
       the <b>self </b>modifier.  An example is the <b>selfwrite </b>access to the
       member attribute of a group, which allows one to add/delete its
       own DN from the member list of a group, while being not allowed
       to affect other members.

       The <b>level </b>access model relies on an incremental interpretation of
       the access privileges.  The possible levels are <b>none</b>, <b>disclose</b>,
       <b>auth</b>, <b>compare</b>, <b>search</b>, <b>read</b>, <b>write</b>, and <b>manage</b>.  Each access
       level implies all the preceding ones, thus <b>manage </b>grants all
       access including administrative access. This access allows some
       modifications which would otherwise be prohibited by the LDAP
       data model or the directory schema, e.g. changing the structural
       objectclass of an entry, or modifying an operational attribute
       that is defined as not user modifiable.  The <b>write </b>access is
       actually the combination of <b>add </b>and <b>delete</b>, which respectively
       restrict the write privilege to add or delete the specified
       <b>&lt;what&gt;</b>.

       The <b>none </b>access level disallows all access including disclosure
       on error.

       The <b>disclose </b>access level allows disclosure of information on
       error.

       The <b>auth </b>access level means that one is allowed access to an
       attribute to perform authentication/authorization operations
       (e.g.  <b>bind</b>) with no other access.  This is useful to grant
       unauthenticated clients the least possible access level to
       critical resources, like passwords.

       The <b>priv </b>access model relies on the explicit setting of access
       privileges for each clause.  The <b>= </b>sign resets previously defined
       accesses; as a consequence, the final access privileges will be
       only those defined by the clause.  The <b>+ </b>and <b>- </b>signs add/remove
       access privileges to the existing ones.  The privileges are <b>m </b>for
       manage, <b>w </b>for write, <b>a </b>for add, <b>z </b>for delete, <b>r </b>for read, <b>s </b>for
       search, <b>c </b>for compare, <b>x </b>for authentication, and <b>d </b>for disclose.
       More than one of the above privileges can be added in one
       statement.  <b>0 </b>indicates no privileges and is used only by itself
       (e.g., +0).  Note that <b>+az </b>is equivalent to <b>+w</b>.

       If no access is given, it defaults to <b>+0</b>.
</pre> <h2>
THE &lt;CONTROL&gt; FIELD </h2>
<pre>
       The optional field <b>&lt;control&gt; </b>controls the flow of access rule
       application.  It can have the forms

            stop
            continue
            break

       where <b>stop</b>, the default, means access checking stops in case of
       match.  The other two forms are used to keep on processing access
       clauses.  In detail, the <b>continue </b>form allows for other <b>&lt;who&gt;</b>
       clauses in the same <b>&lt;access&gt; </b>clause to be considered, so that
       they may result in incrementally altering the privileges, while
       the <b>break </b>form allows for other <b>&lt;access&gt; </b>clauses that match the
       same target to be processed.  Consider the (silly) example

            access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com" attrs=cn
                 by * =cs break

            access to dn.subtree="ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
                 by * +r

       which allows search and compare privileges to everybody under the
       "dc=example,dc=com" tree, with the second rule allowing also read
       in the "ou=People" subtree, or the (even more silly) example

            access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com" attrs=cn
                 by * =cs continue
                 by users +r

       which grants everybody search and compare privileges, and adds
       read privileges to authenticated clients.

       One useful application is to easily grant write privileges to an
       <b>updatedn </b>that is different from the <b>rootdn</b>.  In this case, since
       the <b>updatedn </b>needs write access to (almost) all data, one can use

            access to *
                 by dn.exact="cn=The Update DN,dc=example,dc=com" write
                 by * break

       as the first access rule.  As a consequence, unless the operation
       is performed with the <b>updatedn </b>identity, control is passed
       straight to the subsequent rules.
</pre> <h2>
OPERATION REQUIREMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Operations require different privileges on different portions of
       entries.  The following summary applies to primary MDB database
       backend. Requirements for other backends may (and often do)
       differ.

       The <b>add </b>operation requires <b>add (=a) </b>privileges on the pseudo-
       attribute <b>entry </b>of the entry being added, and <b>add (=a) </b>privileges
       on the pseudo-attribute <b>children </b>of the entry's parent.  When
       adding the suffix entry of a database, <b>add </b>access to <b>children </b>of
       the empty DN ("") is required. Also if Add content ACL checking
       has been configured on the database (see the <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> or
       <a href="slapd-config.5.html">slapd-config(5)</a> manual page), <b>add (=a) </b>will be required on all of
       the attributes being added.

       The <b>bind </b>operation, when credentials are stored in the directory,
       requires <b>auth (=x) </b>privileges on the attribute the credentials
       are stored in (usually <b>userPassword</b>).

       The <b>compare </b>operation requires <b>compare (=c) </b>privileges on the
       attribute that is being compared.

       The <b>delete </b>operation requires <b>delete (=z) </b>privileges on the
       pseudo-attribute <b>entry </b>of the entry being deleted, and <b>delete</b>
       <b>(=d) </b>privileges on the <b>children </b>pseudo-attribute of the entry's
       parent.

       The <b>modify </b>operation requires <b>write (=w) </b>privileges on the
       attributes being modified.  In detail, <b>add (=a) </b>is required to
       add new values, <b>delete (=z) </b>is required to delete existing
       values, and both <b>delete </b>and <b>add (=az)</b>, or <b>write (=w)</b>, are
       required to replace existing values.

       The <b>modrdn </b>operation requires <b>write (=w) </b>privileges on the
       pseudo-attribute <b>entry </b>of the entry whose relative DN is being
       modified, <b>delete (=z) </b>privileges on the pseudo-attribute <b>children</b>
       of the old entry's parents, <b>add (=a) </b>privileges on the pseudo-
       attribute <b>children </b>of the new entry's parents, and <b>add (=a)</b>
       privileges on the attributes that are present in the new relative
       DN.  <b>Delete (=z) </b>privileges are also required on the attributes
       that are present in the old relative DN if <b>deleteoldrdn </b>is set to
       1.

       The <b>search </b>operation, requires <b>search (=s) </b>privileges on the
       <b>entry </b>pseudo-attribute of the searchBase (NOTE: this was
       introduced with OpenLDAP 2.4).  Then, for each entry, it requires
       <b>search (=s) </b>privileges on the attributes that are defined in the
       filter.  The resulting entries are finally tested for <b>read (=r)</b>
       privileges on the pseudo-attribute <b>entry </b>(for read access to the
       entry itself) and for <b>read (=r) </b>access on each value of each
       attribute that is requested.  Also, for each <b>referral </b>object used
       in generating continuation references, the operation requires
       <b>read (=r) </b>access on the pseudo-attribute <b>entry </b>(for read access
       to the referral object itself), as well as <b>read (=r) </b>access to
       the attribute holding the referral information (generally the <b>ref</b>
       attribute).

       Some internal operations and some <b>controls </b>require specific
       access privileges.

       The SASL <b>authzID </b>mapping and the LDAP <b>proxyAuthz </b>control require
       <b>auth (=x) </b>privileges on all the attributes that are present in
       the search filter of the URI regexp maps (the right-hand side of
       the <b>authz-regexp </b>directives).  <b>Auth (=x) </b>privileges are also
       required on the <b>authzTo </b>attribute of the authorizing identity
       and/or on the <b>authzFrom </b>attribute of the authorized identity.  In
       both cases, it is the authorizing identity that requires the
       privileges (i.e. the identity that has authenticated and is now
       trying to do some operation using another entity's permissions).

       In general, when an internal lookup is performed for
       authentication or authorization purposes, search-specific
       privileges (see the access requirements for the search operation
       illustrated above) are relaxed to <b>auth</b>.

       Access control to search entries is checked by the frontend, so
       it is fully honored by all backends; for all other operations and
       for the discovery phase of the search operation, full ACL
       semantics is only supported by the primary backends, i.e.
       <a href="slapd-mdb.5.html">slapd-mdb(5)</a>.

       Some other backend, like <a href="slapd-sql.5.html">slapd-sql(5)</a>, may fully support them;
       others may only support a portion of the described semantics, or
       even differ in some aspects.  The relevant details are described
       in the backend-specific man pages.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       It is strongly recommended to explicitly use the most appropriate
       <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt; </b>in <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;who&gt; </b>clauses, to avoid possible
       incorrect specifications of the access rules as well as for
       performance (avoid unnecessary regex matching when an exact match
       suffices) reasons.

       An administrator might create a rule of the form:

            access to dn.regex="dc=example,dc=com"
                 by ...

       expecting it to match all entries in the subtree
       "dc=example,dc=com".  However, this rule actually matches any DN
       which contains anywhere the substring "dc=example,dc=com".  That
       is, the rule matches both "uid=joe,dc=example,dc=com" and
       "dc=example,dc=com,uid=joe".

       To match the desired subtree, the rule would be more precisely
       written:

            access to dn.regex="^(.+,)?dc=example,dc=com$"
                 by ...

       For performance reasons, it would be better to use the subtree
       style.

            access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"
                 by ...

       When writing submatch rules, it may be convenient to avoid
       unnecessary <b>regex &lt;dnstyle&gt; </b>use; for instance, to allow access to
       the subtree of the user that matches the <b>&lt;what&gt; </b>clause, one could
       use

            access to dn.regex="^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),dc=example,dc=com$"
                 by dn.regex="^uid=$2,dc=example,dc=com$$" write
                 by ...

       However, since all that is required in the <b>&lt;by&gt; </b>clause is
       substring expansion, a more efficient solution is

            access to dn.regex="^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),dc=example,dc=com$"
                 by dn.exact,expand="uid=$2,dc=example,dc=com" write
                 by ...

       In fact, while a <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt; </b>of <b>regex </b>implies substring expansion,
       <b>exact</b>, as well as all the other DN specific <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt; </b>values,
       does not, so it must be explicitly requested.
