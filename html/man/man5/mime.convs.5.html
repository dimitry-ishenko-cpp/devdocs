NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mime.convs - mime type conversion file for cups (deprecated)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>mime.convs </b>file defines the filters that are available for
       converting files from one format to another.  The standard
       filters support text, PDF, PostScript, and many types of image
       files.

       Additional filters are specified in files with the extension
       <i>.convs</i> in the CUPS configuration directory.

       Each line in the <b>mime.convs </b>file is a comment, blank, or filter
       line.  Comment lines start with the # character.  Filter lines
       specify the source and destination MIME types along with a
       relative cost associated with the filter and the filter to run:

           source/type destination/type cost filter

       The <i>source/type</i> field specifies the source MIME media type that
       is consumed by the filter.

       The <i>destination/type</i> field specifies the destination MIME media
       type that is produced by the filter.

       The <i>cost</i> field specifies the relative cost for running the
       filter.  A value of 100 means that the filter uses a large amount
       of resources while a value of 0 means that the filter uses very
       few resources.

       The <i>filter</i> field specifies the filter program filename.
       Filenames are relative to the CUPS filter directory.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/cups</i> - Typical CUPS configuration directory.
       <i>/usr/lib/cups/filter</i> - Typical CUPS filter directory.
       <i>/usr/libexec/cups/filter</i> - CUPS filter directory on macOS.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Define a filter that converts PostScript documents to CUPS Raster
       format:

           application/vnd.cups-postscript application/vnd.cups-raster 50 pstoraster
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       CUPS filters are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a
       future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP
       can be supported using applications such as <a href="../man1/ippeveprinter.1.html">ippeveprinter(1)</a>.
