NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-otp - OATH One-Time Password module
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>moduleload </b><i>otp.la</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>otp </b>module allows time-based one-time password, AKA
       "authenticator-style", and HMAC-based one-time password
       authentication to be used in conjunction with a standard LDAP
       password for two-factor authentication.

       With this module, users would use their password, followed with
       the one-time password in the password prompt to authenticate.

       The password needed for a user to authenticate is calculated
       based on a counter (current time in case of TOTP) and a key that
       is referenced in the user's LDAP entry. Since the password is
       based on the time or number of uses, it changes periodically.
       Once used, it cannot be used again so keyloggers and shoulder-
       surfers are thwarted. A mobile phone application, such as the
       Google Authenticator or YubiKey (a <b>prover</b>), can be used to
       calculate the user's current one-time password, which is
       expressed as a (usually six-digit) number.

       Alternatively, the value can be calculated by some other
       application with access to the user's key and delivered to the
       user through SMS or some other channel. When prompted to
       authenticate, the user merely appends the code provided by the
       prover at the end of their password when authenticating.

       This implementation complies with <b>RFC 4226 HOTP HMAC-Based One</b>
       <b>Time Passwords </b>and <b>RFC 6238 TOTP Time-based One Time Passwords</b>
       and includes support for the SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 HMAC
       algorithms.

       The HMAC key used in the OTP computation is stored in the
       oathOTPToken entry referenced in the user's LDAP entry and the
       parameters are stored in the oathOTPParams LDAP entry referenced
       in the token.

CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Once the module is configured on the database, it will intercept
       LDAP simple binds for users whose LDAP entry has any of the
       <b>oathOTPUser </b>derived objectlasses attached to it. The attributes
       linking the user and the shared secret are:

              <b>oathTOTPToken: &lt;dn&gt;</b>
                     Mandatory for <b>oathTOTPUser</b>, indicates that the
                     named entry is designated to hold the time-based
                     one-time password shared secret and the last
                     password used.

              <b>oathHOTPToken: &lt;dn&gt;</b>
                     Mandatory for <b>oathHOTPUser</b>, indicates that the
                     named entry is designated to hold the one-time
                     password shared secret and the last password used.

              <b>oathTOTPParams: &lt;dn&gt;</b>
                     Mandatory for <b>oathTOTPToken</b>, indicates that the
                     named entry is designated to hold the parameters to
                     generate time-based one-time password shared
                     secret: its length and algorithm to use as well as
                     the length of each time step and the grace period.

              <b>oathHOTPParams: &lt;dn&gt;</b>
                     Mandatory for <b>oathHOTPToken</b>, indicates that the
                     named entry is designated to hold the parameters to
                     generate one-time password shared secret: its
                     length and algorithm to use as well as the
                     permitted number of passwords to skip.

       The following parts of the OATH-LDAP schema are implemented.

       General attributes:

              <b>oathSecret: &lt;data&gt;</b>
                     The shared secret is stored here as raw bytes.

              <b>oathOTPLength: &lt;length&gt;</b>
                     The password length, usually 6.

              <b>oathHMACAlgorithm: &lt;OID&gt;</b>
                     The OID of the hash algorithm to use as defined in
                     RFC 8018.  Supported algorithms include SHA1,
                     SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512.

       The HOTP attributes:

              <b>oathHOTPLookAhead: &lt;number&gt;</b>
                     The number of successive HOTP tokens that can be
                     skipped.

              <b>oathHOTPCounter: &lt;number&gt;</b>
                     The order of the last HOTP token successfully
                     redeemed by the user.

       The TOTP attributes:

              <b>oathTOTPTimeStepPeriod: &lt;seconds&gt;</b>
                     The length of the time-step period for TOTP
                     calculation.

              <b>oathTOTPLastTimeStep: &lt;number&gt;</b>
                     The order of the last TOTP token successfully
                     redeemed by the user.

              <b>oathTOTPTimeStepWindow: &lt;number&gt;</b>
                     The number of time periods around the current time
                     to try when checking the password provided by the
                     user.

              <b>oathTOTPTimeStepDrift: &lt;number&gt;</b>
                     If the client didn't provide the correct token but
                     it still fit with oathTOTPTimeStepWindow above,
                     this attribute records the current offset to
                     provide for slow clock drift of the client device.
