NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapd-asyncmeta - asynchronous metadirectory backend to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>asyncmeta </b>backend to <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> performs basic LDAP proxying
       with respect to a set of remote LDAP servers, called "targets".
       The information contained in these servers can be presented as
       belonging to a single Directory Information Tree (DIT).

       A good knowledge of the functionality of the <b>slapd-meta(5)</b>
       backend  is recommended.   This  backend has been designed as an
       asynchronous version of the <b>meta </b>backend. Unlike <b>meta </b>, the
       operation handling threads are no longer pending on the response
       from the remote server, thus decreasing the number of threads
       necessary to handle the same load. While <b>asyncmeta </b>maintains the
       functionality of <b>meta </b>and has a largely similar codebase, some
       changes in operation and some new configuration directives have
       been added. Some configuration options, such as <b>conn-pool-max ,</b>
       <b>conn-ttl , single-conn , </b>and <b>use-temporary-conn </b>have been
       removed, as they are no longer relevant.

       <b>New connection handling:</b>

       Unlike <b>meta, </b>which caches bound connections, the <b>asyncmeta </b>works
       with a configured maximum number of connections per target.  For
       each request redirected to a target, a different connection is
       selected.  Each connection has a queue, to which the request is
       added before it is sent to the remote server, and is removed
       after the last response for that request is received.
        For each new request, a new connection is chosen using
       round-robin scheduling.

       <b>Overlays:</b>

       Due to implementation specifics, there is no guarantee that any
       of the existing OpenLDAP overlays will work with <b>asyncmeta</b>
       backend.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Refer to <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a> for configuration examples.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf </b>options apply to the ASYNCMETA backend database.
       That is, they must follow a "database asyncmeta" line and come
       before any subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.  Other
       database options are described in the <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> manual page.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIAL CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES </h2>
<pre>
       Target configuration starts with the "uri" directive.  All the
       configuration directives that are not specific to targets should
       be defined first for clarity, including those that are common to
       all backends.  They are:

       <b>default-target none</b>
              This directive forces the backend to reject all those
              operations that must resolve to a single target in case
              none or multiple targets are selected.  They include: add,
              delete, modify, modrdn; compare is not included, as well
              as bind since, as they don't alter entries, in case of
              multiple matches an attempt is made to perform the
              operation on any candidate target, with the constraint
              that at most one must succeed.  This directive can also be
              used when processing targets to mark a specific target as
              default.

       <b>dncache-ttl {DISABLED|forever|&lt;ttl&gt;}</b>
              This directive sets the time-to-live of the DN cache.
              This caches the target that holds a given DN to speed up
              target selection in case multiple targets would result
              from an uncached search; forever means cache never
              expires; disabled means no DN caching; otherwise a valid (
              &gt; 0 ) ttl is required, in the format illustrated for the
              <b>idle-timeout </b>directive.

       <b>onerr {CONTINUE|report|stop}</b>
              This directive allows one to select the behavior in case
              an error is returned by one target during a search.  The
              default, <b>continue</b>, consists in continuing the operation,
              trying to return as much data as possible.  If the value
              is set to <b>stop</b>, the search is terminated as soon as an
              error is returned by one target, and the error is
              immediately propagated to the client.  If the value is set
              to <b>report</b>, the search is continued to the end but, in case
              at least one target returned an error code, the first non-
              success error code is returned.

       <b>max-timeout-ops &lt;number&gt;</b>
              Specify the number of consecutive timed out requests,
              after which the connection will be considered faulty and
              dropped.

       <b>max-pending-ops &lt;number&gt;</b>
              The maximum number of pending requests stored in a
              connection's queue.  The default is 128. When this number
              is exceeded, <b>LDAP_BUSY </b>will be returned to the client.

       <b>max-target-conns &lt;number&gt;</b>
              The maximum number of connections per target. Unlike
              <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a>, no new connections will be created once
              this number is reached. The default value is 255.

       <b>norefs &lt;NO|yes&gt;</b>
              If <b>yes</b>, do not return search reference responses.  By
              default, they are returned unless request is LDAPv2.  If
              set before any target specification, it affects all
              targets, unless overridden by any per-target directive.

       <b>noundeffilter &lt;NO|yes&gt;</b>
              If <b>yes</b>, return success instead of searching if a filter is
              undefined or contains undefined portions.  By default, the
              search is propagated after replacing undefined portions
              with <b>(!(objectClass=*))</b>, which corresponds to the empty
              result set.  If set before any target specification, it
              affects all targets, unless overridden by any per-target
              directive.

       <b>protocol-version {0,2,3}</b>
              This directive indicates what protocol version must be
              used to contact the remote server.  If set to 0 (the
              default), the proxy uses the same protocol version used by
              the client, otherwise the requested protocol is used.  The
              proxy returns <i>unwillingToPerform</i> if an operation that is
              incompatible with the requested protocol is attempted.  If
              set before any target specification, it affects all
              targets, unless overridden by any per-target directive.

       <b>pseudoroot-bind-defer {YES|no}</b>
              This directive, when set to <b>yes</b>, causes the authentication
              to the remote servers with the pseudo-root identity (the
              identity defined in each <b>idassert-bind </b>directive) to be
              deferred until actually needed by subsequent operations.
              Otherwise, all binds as the rootdn are propagated to the
              targets.

       <b>quarantine &lt;interval&gt;,&lt;num&gt;[;&lt;interval&gt;,&lt;num&gt;[...]]</b>
              Turns on quarantine of URIs that returned
              <i>LDAP_UNAVAILABLE</i>, so that an attempt to reconnect only
              occurs at given intervals instead of any time a client
              requests an operation.  The pattern is: retry only after
              at least <i>interval</i> seconds elapsed since last attempt, for
              exactly <i>num</i> times; then use the next pattern.  If <i>num</i> for
              the last pattern is "<b>+</b>", it retries forever; otherwise, no
              more retries occur.  This directive must appear before any
              target specification; it affects all targets with the same
              pattern.

       <b>rebind-as-user {NO|yes}</b>
              If this option is given, the client's bind credentials are
              remembered for rebinds, when trying to re-establish a
              broken connection, or when chasing a referral, if
              <b>chase-referrals </b>is set to <i>yes</i>.

       <b>session-tracking-request {NO|yes}</b>
              Adds session tracking control for all requests.  The
              client's IP and hostname, and the identity associated to
              each request, if known, are sent to the remote server for
              informational purposes.  This directive is incompatible
              with setting <i>protocol-version</i> to 2.  If set before any
              target specification, it affects all targets, unless
              overridden by any per-target directive.
</pre> <h2>
TARGET SPECIFICATION </h2>
<pre>
       Target specification starts with a "uri" directive:

       <b>uri &lt;protocol&gt;://[&lt;host&gt;]/&lt;naming context&gt; [...]</b>
              Identical to <b>meta.  </b>See <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a> for details.

       <b>acl-authcDN &lt;administrative DN for access control purposes&gt;</b>
              DN which is used to query the target server for acl
              checking, as in the LDAP backend; it is supposed to have
              read access on the target server to attributes used on the
              proxy for acl checking.  There is no risk of giving away
              such values; they are only used to check permissions.  <b>The</b>
              <b>acl-authcDN identity is by no means implicitly used by the</b>
              <b>proxy when the client connects anonymously.</b>

       <b>acl-passwd &lt;password&gt;</b>
              Password used with the <b>acl-authcDN </b>above.

       <b>bind-timeout &lt;microseconds&gt;</b>
              This directive defines the timeout, in microseconds, used
              when polling for response after an asynchronous bind
              connection. See <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a> for details.

       <b>chase-referrals {YES|no}</b>
              enable/disable automatic referral chasing, which is
              delegated to the underlying libldap, with rebinding
              eventually performed if the <b>rebind-as-user </b>directive is
              used.  The default is to chase referrals.  If set before
              any target specification, it affects all targets, unless
              overridden by any per-target directive.

       <b>client-pr {accept-unsolicited|DISABLE|&lt;size&gt;}</b>
              This feature allows one to use RFC 2696 Paged Results
              control when performing search operations with a specific
              target, irrespective of the client's request. See
              <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a> for details.

       <b>default-target [&lt;target&gt;]</b>
              The "default-target" directive can also be used during
              target specification.  With no arguments it marks the
              current target as the default.  The optional number marks
              target &lt;target&gt; as the default one, starting from 1.
              Target &lt;target&gt; must be defined.

       <b>filter &lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              This directive allows specifying a <b>regex</b>(5) pattern to
              indicate what search filter terms are actually served by a
              target.

              In a search request, if the search filter matches the
              <i>pattern</i> the target is considered while fulfilling the
              request; otherwise the target is ignored. There may be
              multiple occurrences of the <b>filter </b>directive for each
              target.

       <b>idassert-authzFrom &lt;authz-regexp&gt;</b>
              if defined, selects what <i>local</i> identities are authorized
              to exploit the identity assertion feature.  The string
              <b>&lt;authz-regexp&gt; </b>follows the rules defined for the <i>authzFrom</i>
              attribute.  See <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a>, section related to
              <b>authz-policy</b>, for details on the syntax of this field.

       <b>idassert-bind bindmethod=none|simple|sasl [binddn=&lt;simple DN&gt;]</b>
              <b>[credentials=&lt;simple password&gt;] [saslmech=&lt;SASL mech&gt;]</b>
              <b>[secprops=&lt;properties&gt;] [realm=&lt;realm&gt;]</b>
              <b>[authcId=&lt;authentication ID&gt;] [authzId=&lt;authorization ID&gt;]</b>
              <b>[authz={native|proxyauthz}] [mode=&lt;mode&gt;] [flags=&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              <b>[starttls=no|yes|critical] [tls_cert=&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_key=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_cacert=&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_cacertdir=&lt;path&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqsan=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_cipher_suite=&lt;ciphers&gt;] [tls_ecname=&lt;names&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_protocol_min=&lt;major&gt;[.&lt;minor&gt;]]</b>
              <b>[tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all] </b>Allows one to define the
              parameters of the authentication method that is internally
              used by the proxy to authorize connections that are
              authenticated by other databases. See <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a> for
              details.

       <b>idle-timeout &lt;time&gt;</b>
              This directive causes a a persistent connection  to  be
              dropped after it  has been idle for the specified time.
              The connection will be re-created the next time it is
              selected for use. A connection is considered idle if no
              attempts have been made by the backend to use it to send a
              request to the backend server. If there are still pending
              requests in its queue, the connection will be dropped
              after the last request one has either received a result or
              has timed out.

              [&lt;d&gt;d][&lt;h&gt;h][&lt;m&gt;m][&lt;s&gt;[s]]

              where &lt;d&gt;, &lt;h&gt;, &lt;m&gt; and &lt;s&gt; are respectively treated as
              days, hours, minutes and seconds.  If set before any
              target specification, it affects all targets, unless
              overridden by any per-target directive.

       <b>keepalive &lt;idle&gt;:&lt;probes&gt;:&lt;interval&gt;</b>
              The <b>keepalive </b>parameter sets the values of <i>idle</i>, <i>probes</i>,
              and <i>interval</i> used to check whether a socket is alive; <i>idle</i>
              is the number of seconds a connection needs to remain idle
              before TCP starts sending keepalive probes; <i>probes</i> is the
              maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before
              dropping the connection; <i>interval</i> is interval in seconds
              between individual keepalive probes.  Only some systems
              support the customization of these values; the <b>keepalive</b>
              parameter is ignored otherwise, and system-wide settings
              are used.

       <b>tcp-user-timeout &lt;milliseconds&gt;</b>
              If non-zero, corresponds to the <b>TCP_USER_TIMEOUT </b>set on
              the target connections, overriding the operating system
              setting.  Only some systems support the customization of
              this parameter, it is ignored otherwise and system-wide
              settings are used.

       <b>map {attribute|objectclass} [&lt;local name&gt;|*] {&lt;foreign name&gt;|*}</b>
              This maps object classes and attributes as in the LDAP
              backend.  See <a href="slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap(5)</a>.

       <b>network-timeout &lt;time&gt;</b>
              Sets the network timeout value after which
              <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>/<a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a> following a <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> returns in case
              of no activity while sending an operation to the remote
              target.  The value is in milliseconds, and it can be
              specified as for <b>idle-timeout</b>.  If set before any target
              specification, it affects all targets, unless overridden
              by any per-target directive.

       <b>nretries {forever|never|&lt;nretries&gt;}</b>
              This directive defines how many times forwarding an
              operation should be retried in case of temporary failure
              in contacting a target. The number of retries is per
              operation, so if a bind to the target is necessary first,
              the remaining number is decremented. If defined before any
              target specification, it applies to all targets (by
              default, <b>3 </b>times); the global value can be overridden by
              redefinitions inside each target specification.

       <b>subtree-{exclude|include} &lt;rule&gt;</b>
              This directive allows one to indicate what subtrees are
              actually served by a target. See <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a> for
              details.

       <b>suffixmassage &lt;local suffix&gt; &lt;remote suffix&gt;</b>
              <b>slapd-asyncmeta </b>does not support the rewrite engine used
              by the LDAP and META backends.  <b>suffixmassage </b>can be used
              to perform DN suffix rewriting, the same way as the
              obsoleted suffixmassage directive previously used by the
              LDAP backend.

       <b>t-f-support {NO|yes|discover}</b>
              enable if the remote server supports absolute filters (see
              <i>RFC 4526</i> for details).  If set to <b>discover</b>, support is
              detected by reading the remote server's root DSE.  If set
              before any target specification, it affects all targets,
              unless overridden by any per-target directive.

       <b>timeout [&lt;op&gt;=]&lt;val&gt; [...]</b>
              This directive allows one to set per-operation timeouts.
              Operations can be

              <b>&lt;op&gt; ::= bind, add, delete, modrdn, modify, compare,</b>
              <b>search</b>

              By default, the timeout for all operations is 2 seconds.

              See <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a> for details.

       <b>tls {none|[try-]start|[try-]propagate|ldaps}</b>
              B [starttls=no] <b>[tls_cert=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_key=&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_cacert=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_cacertdir=&lt;path&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqsan=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_cipher_suite=&lt;ciphers&gt;] [tls_ecname=&lt;names&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all]</b>
              Specify TLS settings regular connections.

              If the first parameter is not "none" then this configures
              the TLS settings to be used for regular connections.  The
              StartTLS extended operation will be used when establishing
              the connection unless the URI directive protocol scheme is
              <b>ldaps://</b>.  In that case this keyword may only be set to
              "ldaps" and the StartTLS operation will not be used.

              With <b>propagate</b>, the proxy issues the StartTLS operation
              only if the original connection has a TLS layer set up.
              The <b>try- </b>prefix instructs the proxy to continue operations
              if the StartTLS operation failed; its use is <b>not</b>
              recommended.

              The TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS
              settings, except for <b>tls_reqcert </b>which defaults to
              "demand", <b>tls_reqsan </b>which defaults to "allow", and
              <b>starttls </b>which is overshadowed by the first keyword and
              thus ignored.

              If set before any target specification, it affects all
              targets, unless overridden by any per-target directive.

SCENARIOS </h2>
<pre>
       See <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a> for configuration scenarios.
</pre> <h2>
ACLs </h2>
<pre>
       ACL behavior is identical to meta. See <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
ACCESS CONTROL </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>asyncmeta </b>backend does not honor all ACL semantics as
       described in <a href="slapd.access.5.html">slapd.access(5)</a>.  In general, access checking is
       delegated to the remote server(s).  Only <b>read (=r) </b>access to the
       <b>entry </b>pseudo-attribute and to the other attribute values of the
       entries returned by the <b>search </b>operation is honored, which is
       performed by the frontend.
