NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapd-ldap - LDAP backend to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The LDAP backend to <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> is not an actual database; instead
       it acts as a proxy to forward incoming requests to another LDAP
       server. While processing requests it will also chase referrals,
       so that referrals are fully processed instead of being returned
       to the slapd client.

       Sessions that explicitly Bind to the back-ldap database always
       create their own private connection to the remote LDAP server.
       Anonymous sessions will share a single anonymous connection to
       the remote server. For sessions bound through other mechanisms,
       all sessions with the same DN will share the same connection.
       This connection pooling strategy can enhance the proxy's
       efficiency by reducing the overhead of repeatedly making/breaking
       multiple connections.

       The ldap database can also act as an information service, i.e.
       the identity of locally authenticated clients is asserted to the
       remote server, possibly in some modified form.  For this purpose,
       the proxy binds to the remote server with some administrative
       identity, and, if required, authorizes the asserted identity.
       See the <i>idassert-</i>* rules below.  The administrative identity of
       the proxy, on the remote server, must be allowed to authorize by
       means of appropriate <b>authzTo </b>rules; see <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> for
       details.

       The proxy instance of <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> must contain schema information
       for the attributes and objectClasses used in filters, request DNs
       and request-related data in general.  It should also contain
       schema information for the data returned by the proxied server.
       It is the responsibility of the proxy administrator to keep the
       schema of the proxy lined up with that of the proxied server.

       Note: When looping back to the same instance of <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a>, each
       connection requires a new thread; as a consequence, the <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a>
       <b>threads </b>parameter may need some tuning. In those cases, one may
       consider using <a href="slapd-relay.5.html">slapd-relay(5)</a> instead, which performs the relayed
       operation internally and thus reuses the same connection.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf </b>options apply to the LDAP backend database.
       That is, they must follow a "database ldap" line and come before
       any subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database
       options are described in the <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> manual page.

       Note: In early versions of back-ldap it was recommended to always
       set

              lastmod  off

       for <b>ldap </b>and <b>meta </b>databases.  This was required because
       operational attributes related to entry creation and modification
       should not be proxied, as they could be mistakenly written to the
       target server(s), generating an error.  The current
       implementation automatically sets lastmod to <b>off</b>, so its use is
       redundant and should be omitted.

       <b>uri &lt;ldapurl&gt;</b>
              LDAP server to use.  Multiple URIs can be set in a single
              <b>ldapurl </b>argument, resulting in the underlying library
              automatically calling the first server of the list that
              responds, e.g.

              <b>uri "ldap://host/ ldap://backup-host/"</b>

              The URI list is space- or comma-separated.  Whenever the
              server that responds is not the first one in the list, the
              list is rearranged and the responsive server is moved to
              the head, so that it will be first contacted the next time
              a connection needs to be created.

       <b>acl-bind bindmethod=simple|sasl [binddn=&lt;simple DN&gt;]</b>
              <b>[credentials=&lt;simple password&gt;] [saslmech=&lt;SASL mech&gt;]</b>
              <b>[secprops=&lt;properties&gt;] [realm=&lt;realm&gt;]</b>
              <b>[authcId=&lt;authentication ID&gt;] [authzId=&lt;authorization ID&gt;]</b>
              <b>[starttls=no|yes|critical] [tls_cert=&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_key=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_cacert=&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_cacertdir=&lt;path&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqsan=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_cipher_suite=&lt;ciphers&gt;] [tls_ecname=&lt;names&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_protocol_min=&lt;major&gt;[.&lt;minor&gt;]]</b>
              <b>[tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all]</b>
              Allows one to define the parameters of the authentication
              method that is internally used by the proxy to collect
              info related to access control, and whenever an operation
              occurs with the identity of the rootdn of the LDAP proxy
              database.  The identity defined by this directive,
              according to the properties associated to the
              authentication method, is supposed to have read access on
              the target server to attributes used on the proxy for ACL
              checking.

              There is no risk of giving away such values; they are only
              used to check permissions.  The default is to use <b>simple</b>
              bind, with empty <i>binddn</i> and <i>credentials</i>, which means that
              the related operations will be performed anonymously.  If
              not set, and if <b>idassert-bind </b>is defined, this latter
              identity is used instead.  See <b>idassert-bind </b>for details.

              The connection between the proxy database and the remote
              server associated to this identity is cached regardless of
              the lifespan of the client-proxy connection that first
              established it.

              <b>This identity is not implicitly used by the proxy when the</b>
              <b>client connects anonymously.  </b>The <b>idassert-bind </b>feature,
              instead, in some cases can be crafted to implement that
              behavior, which is <i>intrinsically unsafe and should be used</i>
              <i>with extreme care</i>.

              The TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS
              settings, except for <b>tls_reqcert </b>which defaults to
              "demand", and <b>tls_reqsan </b>which defaults to "allow".

       <b>cancel {ABANDON|ignore|exop[-discover]}</b>
              Defines how to handle operation cancellation.  By default,
              <b>abandon </b>is invoked, so the operation is abandoned
              immediately.  If set to <b>ignore</b>, no action is taken and any
              further response is ignored; this may result in further
              response messages to be queued for that connection, so it
              is recommended that long lasting connections are timed out
              either by <i>idle-timeout</i> or <i>conn-ttl</i>, so that resources
              eventually get released.  If set to <b>exop</b>, a <i>cancel</i>
              operation (RFC 3909) is issued, resulting in the
              cancellation of the current operation; the <i>cancel</i>
              operation waits for remote server response, so its use may
              not be recommended.  If set to <b>exop-discover</b>, support of
              the <i>cancel</i> extended operation is detected by reading the
              remote server's root DSE.

       <b>chase-referrals {YES|no}</b>
              enable/disable automatic referral chasing, which is
              delegated to the underlying libldap, with rebinding
              eventually performed if the <b>rebind-as-user </b>directive is
              used.  The default is to chase referrals.

       <b>conn-pool-max &lt;int&gt;</b>
              This directive defines the maximum size of the privileged
              connections pool.

       <b>conn-ttl &lt;time&gt;</b>
              This directive causes a cached connection to be dropped
              after a given ttl, regardless of being idle or not.  If a
              client connection outlives the remote connection, the
              client will receive <i>LDAP_UNAVAILABLE</i> when it executes the
              next operation.

       <b>idassert-authzFrom &lt;authz-regexp&gt;</b>
              if defined, selects what <i>local</i> identities are authorized
              to exploit the identity assertion feature.  The string
              <b>&lt;authz-regexp&gt; </b>mostly follows the rules defined for the
              <i>authzFrom</i> attribute.  See <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a>, section related
              to <b>authz-policy</b>, for details on the syntax of this field.
              This parameter differs from the documented behavior in
              relation to the meaning of *, which in this case allows
              anonymous rather than denies.

       <b>idassert-bind bindmethod=none|simple|sasl [binddn=&lt;simple DN&gt;]</b>
              <b>[credentials=&lt;simple password&gt;] [saslmech=&lt;SASL mech&gt;]</b>
              <b>[secprops=&lt;properties&gt;] [realm=&lt;realm&gt;]</b>
              <b>[authcId=&lt;authentication ID&gt;] [authzId=&lt;authorization ID&gt;]</b>
              <b>[authz={native|proxyauthz}] [mode=&lt;mode&gt;] [flags=&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              <b>[starttls=no|yes|critical] [tls_cert=&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_key=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_cacert=&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_cacertdir=&lt;path&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqsan=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_cipher_suite=&lt;ciphers&gt;] [tls_ecname=&lt;names&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_protocol_min=&lt;version&gt;] [tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all]</b>
              Allows one to define the parameters of the authentication
              method that is internally used by the proxy to authorize
              connections that are authenticated by other databases.
              Direct binds are always proxied without any idassert
              handling.

              The identity defined by this directive, according to the
              properties associated to the authentication method, is
              supposed to have auth access on the target server to
              attributes used on the proxy for authentication and
              authorization, and to be allowed to authorize the users.
              This requires to have <b>proxyAuthz </b>privileges on a wide set
              of DNs, e.g.  <b>authzTo=dn.subtree:""</b>, and the remote server
              to have <b>authz-policy </b>set to <b>to </b>or <b>both</b>.  See <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a>
              for details on these statements and for remarks and
              drawbacks about their usage.  The supported bindmethods
              are

              <b>none|simple|sasl</b>

              where <b>none </b>is the default, i.e. no <i>identity assertion</i> is
              performed.

              The <b>authz </b>parameter is used to instruct the SASL bind to
              exploit <b>native </b>SASL authorization, if available; since
              connections are cached, this should only be used when
              authorizing with a fixed identity (e.g. by means of the
              <b>authzDN </b>or <b>authzID </b>parameters).  Otherwise, the default
              <b>proxyauthz </b>is used, i.e. the proxyAuthz control (Proxied
              Authorization, RFC 4370) is added to all operations.

              The supported modes are:

              <b>&lt;mode&gt; := {legacy|anonymous|none|self}</b>

              If <b>&lt;mode&gt; </b>is not present, and <b>authzId </b>is given, the proxy
              always authorizes that identity.  <b>&lt;authorization ID&gt; </b>can
              be

              <b>u:&lt;user&gt;</b>

              <b>[dn:]&lt;DN&gt;</b>

              The former is supposed to be expanded by the remote server
              according to the authz rules; see <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> for
              details.  In the latter case, whether or not the <b>dn:</b>
              prefix is present, the string must pass DN validation and
              normalization.

              The default mode is <b>legacy</b>, which implies that the proxy
              will either perform a simple bind as the <i>authcDN</i> or a SASL
              bind as the <i>authcID</i> and assert the client's identity when
              it is not anonymous.  The other modes imply that the proxy
              will always either perform a simple bind as the <i>authcDN</i> or
              a SASL bind as the <i>authcID</i>, unless restricted by
              <b>idassert-authzFrom </b>rules (see below), in which case the
              operation will fail; eventually, it will assert some other
              identity according to <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>.  Other identity assertion
              modes are <b>anonymous </b>and <b>self</b>, which respectively mean that
              the <i>empty</i> or the <i>client</i>'s identity will be asserted; <b>none</b>,
              which means that no proxyAuthz control will be used, so
              the <i>authcDN</i> or the <i>authcID</i> identity will be asserted.  For
              all modes that require the use of the <i>proxyAuthz</i> control,
              on the remote server the proxy identity must have
              appropriate <i>authzTo</i> permissions, or the asserted
              identities must have appropriate <i>authzFrom</i> permissions.
              Note, however, that the ID assertion feature is mostly
              useful when the asserted identities do not exist on the
              remote server.

              Flags can be

              <b>override,[non-]prescriptive,proxy-authz-[non-]critical,dn-{authzid|whoami}</b>

              When the <b>override </b>flag is used, identity assertion takes
              place even when the database is authorizing for the
              identity of the client, i.e. after binding with the
              provided identity, and thus authenticating it, the proxy
              performs the identity assertion using the configured
              identity and authentication method.

              When the <b>prescriptive </b>flag is used (the default),
              operations fail with <i>inappropriateAuthentication</i> for those
              identities whose assertion is not allowed by the
              <b>idassert-authzFrom </b>patterns.  If the <b>non-prescriptive </b>flag
              is used, operations are performed anonymously for those
              identities whose assertion is not allowed by the
              <b>idassert-authzFrom </b>patterns.

              When the <b>proxy-authz-non-critical </b>flag is used (the
              default), the proxyAuthz control is not marked as
              critical, in violation of RFC 4370.  Use of
              <b>proxy-authz-critical </b>is recommended.

              When the <b>dn-authzid </b>flag is used, RFC 3829 LDAP
              Authorization Identity Controls is used to retrieve the
              identity associated to the SASL identity; when the
              <b>dn-whoami </b>flag is used, RFC 4532 LDAP Who am I? Operation
              is performed after the bind for the same purpose.

              The TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS
              settings, except for <b>tls_reqcert </b>which defaults to
              "demand", and <b>tls_reqsan </b>which defaults to "allow".

              The identity associated to this directive is also used for
              privileged operations whenever <b>idassert-bind </b>is defined
              and <b>acl-bind </b>is not.  See <b>acl-bind </b>for details.

       <b>idassert-passthru &lt;authz-regexp&gt;</b>
              if defined, selects what <i>local</i> identities bypass the
              identity assertion feature.  Those identities need to be
              known by the remote host.  The string <b>&lt;authz-regexp&gt;</b>
              follows the rules defined for the <i>authzFrom</i> attribute.
              See <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a>, section related to <b>authz-policy</b>, for
              details on the syntax of this field.

       <b>idle-timeout &lt;time&gt;</b>
              This directive causes a cached connection to be dropped
              after it has been idle for the specified time.  If a
              client connection outlives the remote connection, the
              client will receive <i>LDAP_UNAVAILABLE</i> when it executes the
              next operation.

       <b>keepalive &lt;idle&gt;:&lt;probes&gt;:&lt;interval&gt;</b>
              The <b>keepalive </b>parameter sets the values of <i>idle</i>, <i>probes</i>,
              and <i>interval</i> used to check whether a socket is alive; <i>idle</i>
              is the number of seconds a connection needs to remain idle
              before TCP starts sending keepalive probes; <i>probes</i> is the
              maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before
              dropping the connection; <i>interval</i> is interval in seconds
              between individual keepalive probes.  Only some systems
              support the customization of these values; the <b>keepalive</b>
              parameter is ignored otherwise, and system-wide settings
              are used.

       <b>tcp-user-timeout &lt;milliseconds&gt;</b>
              If non-zero, corresponds to the <b>TCP_USER_TIMEOUT </b>set on
              the target connections, overriding the operating system
              setting.  Only some systems support the customization of
              this parameter, it is ignored otherwise and system-wide
              settings are used.

       <b>network-timeout &lt;time&gt;</b>
              Sets the network timeout value after which
              <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>/<a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a> following a <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> returns in case
              of no activity.  The value is in seconds, and it can be
              specified as for <b>idle-timeout</b>.

       <b>norefs &lt;NO|yes&gt;</b>
              If <b>yes</b>, do not return search reference responses.  By
              default, they are returned unless request is LDAPv2.

       <b>omit-unknown-schema &lt;NO|yes&gt;</b>
              If <b>yes</b>, do not return objectClasses or attributes that are
              not known to the local server.  The default is to return
              all schema elements.

       <b>noundeffilter &lt;NO|yes&gt;</b>
              If <b>yes</b>, return success instead of searching if a filter is
              undefined or contains undefined portions.  By default, the
              search is propagated after replacing undefined portions
              with <b>(!(objectClass=*))</b>, which corresponds to the empty
              result set.

       <b>onerr {CONTINUE|stop}</b>
              This directive allows one to select the behavior in case
              an error is returned by the remote server during a search.
              The default, <b>continue</b>, consists in returning success.  If
              the value is set to <b>stop</b>, the error is returned to the
              client.

       <b>protocol-version {0,2,3}</b>
              This directive indicates what protocol version must be
              used to contact the remote server.  If set to 0 (the
              default), the proxy uses the same protocol version used by
              the client, otherwise the requested protocol is used.  The
              proxy returns <i>unwillingToPerform</i> if an operation that is
              incompatible with the requested protocol is attempted.

       <b>proxy-whoami {NO|yes}</b>
              Turns on proxying of the WhoAmI extended operation. If
              this option is given, back-ldap will replace slapd's
              original WhoAmI routine with its own. On slapd sessions
              that were authenticated by back-ldap, the WhoAmI request
              will be forwarded to the remote LDAP server. Other
              sessions will be handled by the local slapd, as before.
              This option is mainly useful in conjunction with Proxy
              Authorization.

       <b>quarantine &lt;interval&gt;,&lt;num&gt;[;&lt;interval&gt;,&lt;num&gt;[...]]</b>
              Turns on quarantine of URIs that returned
              <i>LDAP_UNAVAILABLE</i>, so that an attempt to reconnect only
              occurs at given intervals instead of any time a client
              requests an operation.  The pattern is: retry only after
              at least <i>interval</i> seconds elapsed since last attempt, for
              exactly <i>num</i> times; then use the next pattern.  If <i>num</i> for
              the last pattern is "<b>+</b>", it retries forever; otherwise, no
              more retries occur.  The process can be restarted by
              resetting the <i>olcDbQuarantine</i> attribute of the database
              entry in the configuration backend.

       <b>rebind-as-user {NO|yes}</b>
              If this option is given, the client's bind credentials are
              remembered for rebinds, when trying to re-establish a
              broken connection, or when chasing a referral, if
              <b>chase-referrals </b>is set to <i>yes</i>.  Note, however, that
              connection is not re-established automatically after it
              was dropped due to <b>idle-timeout </b>or <b>conn-ttl .</b>

       <b>session-tracking-request {NO|yes}</b>
              Adds session tracking control for all requests.  The
              client's IP and hostname, and the identity associated to
              each request, if known, are sent to the remote server for
              informational purposes.  This directive is incompatible
              with setting <i>protocol-version</i> to 2.

       <b>single-conn {NO|yes}</b>
              Discards current cached connection when the client
              rebinds.

       <b>t-f-support {NO|yes|discover}</b>
              enable if the remote server supports absolute filters (see
              <i>RFC 4526</i> for details).  If set to <b>discover</b>, support is
              detected by reading the remote server's root DSE.

       <b>timeout [&lt;op&gt;=]&lt;val&gt; [...]</b>
              This directive allows one to set per-operation timeouts.
              Operations can be

              <b>&lt;op&gt; ::= bind, add, delete, modrdn, modify, compare,</b>
              <b>search</b>

              The overall duration of the <b>search </b>operation is controlled
              either by the <b>timelimit </b>parameter or by server-side
              enforced time limits (see <b>timelimit </b>and <b>limits </b>in
              <a href="slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a> for details).  This <b>timeout </b>parameter
              controls how long the target can be irresponsive before
              the operation is aborted.  Timeout is meaningless for the
              remaining operations, <b>unbind </b>and <b>abandon</b>, which do not
              imply any response, while it is not yet implemented in
              currently supported <b>extended </b>operations.  If no operation
              is specified, the timeout <b>val </b>affects all supported
              operations.

              Note: if the timelimit is exceeded, the operation is
              cancelled (according to the <b>cancel </b>directive); the
              protocol does not provide any means to rollback
              operations, so the client will not be notified about the
              result of the operation, which may eventually succeeded or
              not.  In case the timeout is exceeded during a bind
              operation, the connection is destroyed, according to
              RFC4511.

              Note: in some cases, this backend may issue binds prior to
              other operations (e.g. to bind anonymously or with some
              prescribed identity according to the <b>idassert-bind</b>
              directive).  In this case, the timeout of the operation
              that resulted in the bind is used.

       <b>tls {none|[try-]start|[try-]propagate|ldaps} [starttls=no]</b>
              <b>[tls_cert=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_key=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_cacert=&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_cacertdir=&lt;path&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_reqsan=never|allow|try|demand]</b>
              <b>[tls_cipher_suite=&lt;ciphers&gt;] [tls_ecname=&lt;names&gt;]</b>
              <b>[tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all]</b>
              Specify TLS settings for regular connections.

              If the first parameter is not "none" then this configures
              the TLS settings to be used for regular connections.  The
              StartTLS extended operation will be used when establishing
              the connection unless the URI directive protocol scheme is
              <b>ldaps://</b>.  In that case this keyword may only be set to
              "ldaps" and the StartTLS operation will not be used.

              With <b>propagate</b>, the proxy issues the StartTLS operation
              only if the original connection has a TLS layer set up.
              The <b>try- </b>prefix instructs the proxy to continue operations
              if the StartTLS operation failed; its use is <b>not</b>
              recommended.

              The TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS
              settings, except for <b>tls_reqcert </b>which defaults to
              "demand", <b>tls_reqsan </b>which defaults to "allow", and
              <b>starttls </b>which is overshadowed by the first keyword and
              thus ignored.

       <b>use-temporary-conn {NO|yes}</b>
              when set to <b>yes</b>, create a temporary connection whenever
              competing with other threads for a shared one; otherwise,
              wait until the shared connection is available.

ACCESS CONTROL </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>ldap </b>backend does not honor all ACL semantics as described in
       <a href="slapd.access.5.html">slapd.access(5)</a>.  In general, access checking is delegated to the
       remote server(s).  Only <b>read (=r) </b>access to the <b>entry </b>pseudo-
       attribute and to the other attribute values of the entries
       returned by the <b>search </b>operation is honored, which is performed
       by the frontend.
</pre> <h2>
OVERLAYS </h2>
<pre>
       The LDAP backend provides basic proxying functionalities to many
       overlays.  The <b>chain </b>overlay, described in <a href="slapo-chain.5.html">slapo-chain(5)</a>, and
       the <b>translucent </b>overlay, described in <a href="slapo-translucent.5.html">slapo-translucent(5)</a>,
       deserve a special mention.

       Conversely, there are many overlays that are best used in
       conjunction with the LDAP backend.  The <b>proxycache </b>overlay allows
       caching of LDAP search requests (queries) in a local database.
       See <a href="slapo-pcache.5.html">slapo-pcache(5)</a> for details.  The <b>rwm </b>overlay provides DN
       rewrite and attribute/objectClass mapping capabilities to the
       underlying database.  See <a href="slapo-rwm.5.html">slapo-rwm(5)</a> for details.
