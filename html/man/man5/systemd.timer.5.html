NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd.timer - Timer unit configuration
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>timer</i>.timer
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".timer" encodes
       information about a timer controlled and supervised by systemd,
       for timer-based activation.

       This man page lists the configuration options specific to this
       unit type. See <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for the common options of all unit
       configuration files. The common configuration items are
       configured in the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The
       timer specific configuration options are configured in the
       [Timer] section.

       For each timer file, a matching unit file must exist, describing
       the unit to activate when the timer elapses. By default, a
       service by the same name as the timer (except for the suffix) is
       activated. Example: a timer file foo.timer activates a matching
       service foo.service. The unit to activate may be controlled by
       <i>Unit=</i> (see below).

       Note that in case the unit to activate is already active at the
       time the timer elapses it is not restarted, but simply left
       running. There is no concept of spawning new service instances in
       this case. Due to this, services with <i>RemainAfterExit=yes</i> set
       (which stay around continuously even after the service's main
       process exited) are usually not suitable for activation via
       repetitive timers, as they will only be activated once, and then
       stay around forever. Target units, which by default do not
       deactivate on their own, can be activated repeatedly by timers by
       setting <i>StopWhenUnneeded=yes</i> on them. This will cause a target
       unit to be stopped immediately after its activation, if it is not
       a dependency of another running unit.
</pre> <h2>
AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Implicit Dependencies</b>
       The following dependencies are implicitly added:

       •   Timer units automatically gain a <i>Before=</i> dependency on the
           service they are supposed to activate.

   <b>Default Dependencies</b>
       The following dependencies are added unless
       <i>DefaultDependencies=no</i> is set:

       •   Timer units will automatically have dependencies of type
           <i>Requires=</i> and <i>After=</i> on sysinit.target, a dependency of type
           <i>Before=</i> on timers.target, as well as <i>Conflicts=</i> and <i>Before=</i>
           on shutdown.target to ensure that they are stopped cleanly
           prior to system shutdown. Only timer units involved with
           early boot or late system shutdown should disable the
           <i>DefaultDependencies=</i> option.

       •   Timer units with at least one <i>OnCalendar=</i> directive acquire a
           pair of additional <i>After=</i> dependencies on time-set.target and
           time-sync.target, in order to avoid being started before the
           system clock has been correctly set. See <a href="../man7/systemd.special.7.html">systemd.special(7)</a>
           for details on these two targets.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Timer unit files may include [Unit] and [Install] sections, which
       are described in <a href="systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>.

       Timer unit files must include a [Timer] section, which carries
       information about the timer it defines. The options specific to
       the [Timer] section of timer units are the following:

       <i>OnActiveSec=</i>, <i>OnBootSec=</i>, <i>OnStartupSec=</i>, <i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>,
       <i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i>
           Defines monotonic timers relative to different starting
           points:

           Multiple directives may be combined of the same and of
           different types, in which case the timer unit will trigger
           whenever any of the specified timer expressions elapse. For
           example, by combining <i>OnBootSec=</i> and <i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>, it is
           possible to define a timer that elapses in regular intervals
           and activates a specific service each time. Moreover, both
           monotonic time expressions and <i>OnCalendar=</i> calendar
           expressions may be combined in the same timer unit.

           The arguments to the directives are time spans configured in
           seconds. Example: "OnBootSec=50" means 50s after boot-up. The
           argument may also include time units. Example: "OnBootSec=5h
           30min" means 5 hours and 30 minutes after boot-up. For
           details about the syntax of time spans, see <a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)</a>.

           If a timer configured with <i>OnBootSec=</i> or <i>OnStartupSec=</i> is
           already in the past when the timer unit is activated, it will
           immediately elapse and the configured unit is started. This
           is not the case for timers defined in the other directives.

           These are monotonic timers, independent of wall-clock time
           and timezones. If the computer is temporarily suspended, the
           monotonic clock generally pauses, too. Note that if
           <i>WakeSystem=</i> is used, a different monotonic clock is selected
           that continues to advance while the system is suspended and
           thus can be used as the trigger to resume the system.

           If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the
           list of timers is reset (both monotonic timers and
           <i>OnCalendar=</i> timers, see below), and all prior assignments
           will have no effect.

           Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the precise
           time configured with these settings, as they are subject to
           the <i>AccuracySec=</i> setting below.

       <i>OnCalendar=</i>
           Defines realtime (i.e. wallclock) timers with calendar event
           expressions. See <a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)</a> for more information on the
           syntax of calendar event expressions. Otherwise, the
           semantics are similar to <i>OnActiveSec=</i> and related settings.

           Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the precise
           time configured with this setting, as it is subject to the
           <i>AccuracySec=</i> setting below.

           May be specified more than once, in which case the timer unit
           will trigger whenever any of the specified expressions
           elapse. Moreover calendar timers and monotonic timers (see
           above) may be combined within the same timer unit.

           If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the
           list of timers is reset (both <i>OnCalendar=</i> timers and
           monotonic timers, see above), and all prior assignments will
           have no effect.

           Note that calendar timers might be triggered at unexpected
           times if the system's realtime clock is not set correctly.
           Specifically, on systems that lack a battery-buffered
           Realtime Clock (RTC) it might be wise to enable
           systemd-time-wait-sync.service to ensure the clock is
           adjusted to a network time source <i>before</i> the timer event is
           set up. Timer units with at least one <i>OnCalendar=</i> expression
           are automatically ordered after time-sync.target, which
           systemd-time-wait-sync.service is ordered before.

           When a system is temporarily put to sleep (i.e. system
           suspend or hibernation) the realtime clock does not pause.
           When a calendar timer elapses while the system is sleeping it
           will not be acted on immediately, but once the system is
           later resumed it will catch up and process all timers that
           triggered while the system was sleeping. Note that if a
           calendar timer elapsed more than once while the system was
           continuously sleeping the timer will only result in a single
           service activation. If <i>WakeSystem=</i> (see below) is enabled a
           calendar time event elapsing while the system is suspended
           will cause the system to wake up (under the condition the
           system's hardware supports time-triggered wake-up
           functionality).

           Added in version 197.

       <i>AccuracySec=</i>
           Specify the accuracy the timer shall elapse with. Defaults to
           1min. The timer is scheduled to elapse within a time window
           starting with the time specified in <i>OnCalendar=</i>,
           <i>OnActiveSec=</i>, <i>OnBootSec=</i>, <i>OnStartupSec=</i>, <i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i> or
           <i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i> and ending the time configured with
           <i>AccuracySec=</i> later. Within this time window, the expiry time
           will be placed at a host-specific, randomized, but stable
           position that is synchronized between all local timer units.
           This is done in order to optimize power consumption to
           suppress unnecessary CPU wake-ups. To get best accuracy, set
           this option to 1us. Note that the timer is still subject to
           the timer slack configured via <a href="systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)</a>'s
           <i>TimerSlackNSec=</i> setting. See <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> for details. To
           optimize power consumption, make sure to set this value as
           high as possible and as low as necessary.

           Note that this setting is primarily a power saving option
           that allows coalescing CPU wake-ups. It should not be
           confused with <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> (see below) which adds a
           random value to the time the timer shall elapse next and
           whose purpose is the opposite: to stretch elapsing of timer
           events over a longer period to reduce workload spikes. For
           further details and explanations and how both settings play
           together, see below.

           Added in version 209.

       <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i>
           Delay the timer by a randomly selected, evenly distributed
           amount of time between 0 and the specified time value.
           Defaults to 0, indicating that no randomized delay shall be
           applied. Each timer unit will determine this delay randomly
           before each iteration, and the delay will simply be added on
           top of the next determined elapsing time, unless modified
           with <i>FixedRandomDelay=</i>, see below.

           This setting is useful to stretch dispatching of similarly
           configured timer events over a certain time interval, to
           prevent them from firing all at the same time, possibly
           resulting in resource congestion.

           Note the relation to <i>AccuracySec=</i> above: the latter allows
           the service manager to coalesce timer events within a
           specified time range in order to minimize wakeups, while this
           setting does the opposite: it stretches timer events over an
           interval, to make it unlikely that they fire simultaneously.
           If <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> and <i>AccuracySec=</i> are used in
           conjunction, first the randomized delay is added, and then
           the result is possibly further shifted to coalesce it with
           other timer events happening on the system. As mentioned
           above <i>AccuracySec=</i> defaults to 1 minute and
           <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> to 0, thus encouraging coalescing of
           timer events. In order to optimally stretch timer events over
           a certain range of time, set <i>AccuracySec=1us</i> and
           <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> to some higher value.

           Added in version 229.

       <i>FixedRandomDelay=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When enabled, the randomized offset
           specified by <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> is reused for all firings of
           the same timer. For a given timer unit, the offset depends on
           the machine ID, user identifier and timer name, which means
           that it is stable between restarts of the manager. This
           effectively creates a fixed offset for an individual timer,
           reducing the jitter in firings of this timer, while still
           avoiding firing at the same time as other similarly
           configured timers.

           This setting has no effect if <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> is set to
           0. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

           Added in version 247.

       <i>OnClockChange=</i>, <i>OnTimezoneChange=</i>
           These options take boolean arguments. When true, the service
           unit will be triggered when the system clock (<b>CLOCK_REALTIME</b>)
           jumps relative to the monotonic clock (<b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>), or
           when the local system timezone is modified. These options can
           be used alone or in combination with other timer expressions
           (see above) within the same timer unit. These options default
           to <b>false</b>.

           Added in version 242.

       <i>Unit=</i>
           The unit to activate when this timer elapses. The argument is
           a unit name, whose suffix is not ".timer". If not specified,
           this value defaults to a service that has the same name as
           the timer unit, except for the suffix. (See above.) It is
           recommended that the unit name that is activated and the unit
           name of the timer unit are named identically, except for the
           suffix.

       <i>Persistent=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, the time when the service
           unit was last triggered is stored on disk. When the timer is
           activated, the service unit is triggered immediately if it
           would have been triggered at least once during the time when
           the timer was inactive. Such triggering is nonetheless
           subject to the delay imposed by <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i>. This is
           useful to catch up on missed runs of the service when the
           system was powered down. Note that this setting only has an
           effect on timers configured with <i>OnCalendar=</i>. Defaults to
           <b>false</b>.

           Use <b>systemctl clean --what=state ...  </b>on the timer unit to
           remove the timestamp file maintained by this option from
           disk. In particular, use this command before uninstalling a
           timer unit. See <a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a> for details.

           Added in version 212.

       <i>WakeSystem=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, an elapsing timer will
           cause the system to resume from suspend, should it be
           suspended and if the system supports this. Note that this
           option will only make sure the system resumes on the
           appropriate times, it will not take care of suspending it
           again after any work that is to be done is finished. Defaults
           to <b>false</b>.

           Note that this functionality requires privileges and is thus
           generally only available in the system service manager.

           Note that behaviour of monotonic clock timers (as configured
           with <i>OnActiveSec=</i>, <i>OnBootSec=</i>, <i>OnStartupSec=</i>,
           <i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>, <i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i>, see above) is altered
           depending on this option. If false, a monotonic clock is used
           that is paused during system suspend (<b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>), if
           true a different monotonic clock is used that continues
           advancing during system suspend (<b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME</b>), see
           <a href="../man2/clock_getres.2.html">clock_getres(2)</a> for details.

           Added in version 212.

       <i>RemainAfterElapse=</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, a timer will stay loaded,
           and its state remains queryable even after it elapsed and the
           associated unit (as configured with <i>Unit=</i>, see above)
           deactivated again. If false, an elapsed timer unit that
           cannot elapse anymore is unloaded once its associated unit
           deactivated again. Turning this off is particularly useful
           for transient timer units. Note that this setting has an
           effect when repeatedly starting a timer unit: if
           <i>RemainAfterElapse=</i> is on, starting the timer a second time
           has no effect. However, if <i>RemainAfterElapse=</i> is off and the
           timer unit was already unloaded, it can be started again, and
           thus the service can be triggered multiple times. Defaults to
           <b>true</b>.

           Added in version 229.
