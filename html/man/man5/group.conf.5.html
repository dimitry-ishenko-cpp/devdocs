NAME </h2>
<pre>
       group.conf - configuration file for the pam_group module
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but
       instead it grants group memberships (in the credential setting
       phase of the authentication module) to the user. Such memberships
       are based on the service they are applying for.

       For this module to function correctly there must be a correctly
       formatted /etc/security/group.conf file present. White spaces are
       ignored and lines maybe extended with '\' (escaped newlines).
       Text following a '#' is ignored to the end of the line.

       The syntax of the lines is as follows:

       <i>services</i>;<i>ttys</i>;<i>users</i>;<i>times</i>;<i>groups</i>

       The first field, the <i>services</i> field, is a logic list of PAM
       service names that the rule applies to.

       The second field, the <i>tty</i> field, is a logic list of terminal
       names that this rule applies to.

       The third field, the <i>users</i> field, is a logic list of users, or a
       UNIX group, or a netgroup of users to whom this rule applies.
       Group names are preceded by a '%' symbol, while netgroup names
       are preceded by a '@' symbol.

       A logic list namely means individual tokens that are optionally
       prefixed with '!' (logical not) and separated with '&amp;' (logical
       and) and '|' (logical or).

       For these items the simple wildcard '*' may be used only once.
       With UNIX groups or netgroups no wildcards or logic operators are
       allowed.

       The <i>times</i> field is used to indicate "when" these groups are to be
       given to the user. The format here is a logic list of
       day/time-range entries. The days are specified by a sequence of
       two character entries, MoTuSa for example is Monday Tuesday and
       Saturday. Note that repeated days are unset MoMo = no day, and
       MoWk = all weekdays bar Monday. The two character combinations
       accepted are Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su Wk Wd Al, the last two being
       week-end days and all 7 days of the week respectively. As a final
       example, AlFr means all days except Friday.

       Each day/time-range can be prefixed with a '!' to indicate
       "anything but". The time-range part is two 24-hour times HHMM,
       separated by a hyphen, indicating the start and finish time (if
       the finish time is smaller than the start time it is deemed to
       apply on the following day).

       The <i>groups</i> field is a comma or space separated list of groups
       that the user inherits membership of. These groups are added if
       the previous fields are satisfied by the user's request.

       For a rule to be active, ALL of service+ttys+users must be
       satisfied by the applying process.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       These are some example lines which might be specified in
       /etc/security/group.conf.

       Running 'xsh' on tty* (any ttyXXX device), the user 'us' is given
       access to the floppy (through membership of the floppy group)

           xsh;tty*&amp;!ttyp*;us;Al0000-2400;floppy

       Running 'xsh' on tty* (any ttyXXX device), the users 'sword',
       'pike' and 'shield' are given access to games (through membership
       of the floppy group) after work hours.

           xsh; tty* ;sword|pike|shield;!Wk0900-1800;games, sound
           xsh; tty* ;*;Al0900-1800;floppy

       Any member of the group 'admin' running 'xsh' on tty*, is granted
       access (at any time) to the group 'plugdev'

           xsh; tty* ;%admin;Al0000-2400;plugdev
