NAME </h2>

       homed.conf, homed.conf.d - Home area/user account manager
       configuration files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
           /etc/systemd/homed.conf
           /run/systemd/homed.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/homed.conf

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These configuration files control default parameters for home
       areas/user accounts created and managed by
       <a href="../man8/systemd-homed.service.8.html">systemd-homed.service(8)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE </h2>
<pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so
       configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from
       those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of
       the listed directories in order of priority, only the first file
       found is used: /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], /usr/lib/systemd/. The vendor
       version of the file contains commented out entries showing the
       defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can
       also be created by creating drop-ins, as described below. The
       main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose (or a
       copy in /etc/ if it's shipped under /usr/), however using
       drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over
       modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration
       snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/.
       Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main
       configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic
       order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside.
       When multiple files specify the same option, for options which
       accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last
       takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values,
       entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can
       install drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
       local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
       configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have
       to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to
       prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit
       number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a
       concept of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship
       drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range used by
       users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding
       accidentally drop-ins defined by users. It is recommended to use
       the range 10-40 for drop-ins in /usr/ and the range 60-90 for
       drop-ins in /etc/ and /run/, to make sure that local and
       transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by the OS
       vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the
       recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the
       configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the
       vendor configuration file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are available in the [Home] section:

       <i>DefaultStorage=</i>
           The default storage to use for home areas. Takes one of
           "luks", "fscrypt", "directory", "subvolume", "cifs". For
           details about these options, see <a href="../man1/homectl.1.html">homectl(1)</a>. If not
           configured or assigned the empty string, the default storage
           is automatically determined: if not running in a container
           environment and /home/ is not itself encrypted, defaults to
           "luks". Otherwise defaults to "subvolume" if /home/ is on a
           btrfs file system, and "directory" otherwise. Note that the
           storage selected on the <b>homectl </b>command line always takes
           precedence.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>DefaultFileSystemType=</i>
           When using "luks" as storage (see above), selects the default
           file system to use inside the user's LUKS volume. Takes one
           of "btrfs", "ext4" or "xfs". If not specified defaults to
           "btrfs". This setting has no effect if a different storage
           mechanism is used. The file system type selected on the
           <b>homectl </b>command line always takes precedence.

           Added in version 246.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
        1. ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£ Please note that those configuration files must
           be available at all times. If /usr/local/ is a separate
           partition, it may not be available during early boot, and
           must not be used for configuration.
