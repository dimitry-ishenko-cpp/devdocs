SYNOPSIS </h2>

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>mdadm</i> is a tool for creating, managing, and monitoring RAID
       devices using the <b>md </b>driver in Linux.

       Some common tasks, such as assembling all arrays, can be
       simplified by describing the devices and arrays in this
       configuration file.

   <b>SYNTAX</b>
       The file should be seen as a collection of words separated by
       white space (space, tab, or newline).  Any word that beings with
       a hash sign (#) starts a comment and that word together with the
       remainder of the line is ignored.

       Spaces can be included in a word using quotation characters.
       Either single quotes (<b>'</b>) or double quotes (<b>"</b>) may be used.  All
       the characters from one quotation character to next identical
       character are protected and will not be used to separate words to
       start new quoted strings.  To include a single quote it must be
       between double quotes.  To include a double quote it must be
       between single quotes.

       Any line that starts with white space (space or tab) is treated
       as though it were a continuation of the previous line.

       Empty lines are ignored, but otherwise each (non continuation)
       line must start with a keyword as listed below.  The keywords are
       case insensitive and can be abbreviated to 3 characters.

       The keywords are:

       <b>DEVICE </b>A <b>device </b>line lists the devices (whole devices or
              partitions) that might contain a component of an MD array.
              When looking for the components of an array, <i>mdadm</i> will
              scan these devices (or any devices listed on the command
              line).

              The <b>device </b>line may contain a number of different devices
              (separated by spaces) and each device name can contain
              wild cards as defined by <a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob(7)</a>.

              Also, there may be several device lines present in the
              file.

              Alternatively, a <b>device </b>line can contain either or both of
              the  words <b>containers </b>and <b>partitions</b>.  The word <b>containers</b>
              will cause <i>mdadm</i> to look for assembled CONTAINER arrays
              and included them as a source for assembling further
              arrays.

              The word <i>partitions</i> will cause <i>mdadm</i> to read
              <i>/proc/partitions</i> and include all devices and partitions
              found therein.  <i>mdadm</i> does not use the names from
              <i>/proc/partitions</i> but only the major and minor device
              numbers.  It scans <i>/dev</i> to find the name that matches the
              numbers.

              If no DEVICE line is present in any config file, then
              "DEVICE partitions containers" is assumed.

              For example:

              DEVICE /dev/hda* /dev/hdc*
              DEV    /dev/sd*
              DEVICE /dev/disk/by-path/pci*
              DEVICE partitions

       <b>ARRAY  </b>The ARRAY lines identify actual arrays.  The second word
              on the line may be the name of the device where the array
              is normally assembled, such as <b>/dev/md1 </b>or <b>/dev/md/backup</b>.
              If the name does not start with a slash ('<b>/</b>'), it is
              treated as being in <b>/dev/md/</b>.  Alternately the word
              <b>&lt;ignore&gt; </b>(complete with angle brackets) can be given in
              which case any array which matches the rest of the line
              will never be automatically assembled.  If no device name
              is given, <i>mdadm</i> will use various heuristics to determine
              an appropriate name.

              Subsequent words identify the array, or identify the array
              as a member of a group. If multiple identities are given,
              then a component device must match ALL identities to be
              considered a match.  Each identity word has a tag, and
              equals sign, and some value.  The tags are:

           <b>uuid=  </b>The value should be a 128 bit uuid in hexadecimal,
                  with punctuation interspersed if desired.  This must
                  match the uuid stored in the superblock.

           <b>super-minor=</b>
                  The value is an integer which indicates the minor
                  number that was stored in the superblock when the
                  array was created. When an array is created as
                  /dev/mdX, then the minor number X is stored.

           <b>devices=</b>
                  The value is a comma separated list of device names or
                  device name patterns.  Only devices with names which
                  match one entry in the list will be used to assemble
                  the array.  Note that the devices listed there must
                  also be listed on a DEVICE line.

           <b>level= </b>The value is a RAID level.  This is not normally used
                  to identify an array, but is supported so that the
                  output of

                  <b>mdadm --examine --scan</b>

                  can be use directly in the configuration file.

           <b>num-devices=</b>
                  The value is the number of devices in a complete
                  active array.  As with <b>level= </b>this is mainly for
                  compatibility with the output of

                  <b>mdadm --examine --scan</b>.

           <b>spares=</b>
                  The value is a number of spare devices to expect the
                  array to have.  The sole use of this keyword and value
                  is as follows: <b>mdadm --monitor </b>will report an array if
                  it is found to have fewer than this number of spares
                  when <b>--monitor </b>starts or when <b>--oneshot </b>is used.

           <b>spare-group=</b>
                  The value is a textual name for a group of arrays.
                  All arrays with the same <b>spare-group </b>name are
                  considered to be part of the same group.  The
                  significance of a group of arrays is that <i>mdadm</i> will,
                  when monitoring the arrays, move a spare drive from
                  one array in a group to another array in that group if
                  the first array had a failed or missing drive but no
                  spare.

           <b>auto=  </b>This option is rarely needed with mdadm-3.0,
                  particularly if use with the Linux kernel v2.6.28 or
                  later.  It tells <i>mdadm</i> whether to use partitionable
                  array or non-partitionable arrays and, in the absence
                  of <i>udev</i>, how many partition devices to create.  From
                  2.6.28 all md array devices are partitionable, hence
                  this option is not needed.

                  The value of this option can be "yes" or "md" to
                  indicate that a traditional, non-partitionable md
                  array should be created, or "mdp", "part" or
                  "partition" to indicate that a partitionable md array
                  (only available in linux 2.6 and later) should be
                  used.  This later set can also have a number appended
                  to indicate how many partitions to create device files
                  for, e.g.  <b>auto=mdp5</b>.  The default is 4.

           <b>bitmap=</b>
                  The option specifies a file in which a write-intent
                  bitmap should be found.  When assembling the array,
                  <i>mdadm</i> will provide this file to the <b>md </b>driver as the
                  bitmap file.  This has the same function as the
                  <b>--bitmap-file </b>option to <b>--assemble</b>.

           <b>metadata=</b>
                  Specify the metadata format that the array has.  This
                  is mainly recognised for comparability with the output
                  of <b>mdadm -Es</b>.

           <b>container=</b>
                  Specify that this array is a member array of some
                  container.  The value given can be either a path name
                  in /dev, or a UUID of the container array.

           <b>member=</b>
                  Specify that this array is a member array of some
                  container.  Each type of container has some way to
                  enumerate member arrays, often a simple sequence
                  number.  The value identifies which member of a
                  container the array is.  It will usually accompany a
                  "container=" word.

       <b>MAILADDR</b>
              The <b>mailaddr </b>line gives an E-mail address that alerts
              should be sent to when <i>mdadm</i> is running in <b>--monitor </b>mode
              (and was given the <b>--scan </b>option).  There should only be
              one <b>MAILADDR </b>line and it should have only one address.
              Any subsequent addresses are silently ignored.

       <b>MAILFROM</b>
              The <b>mailfrom </b>line (which can only be abbreviated to at
              least 5 characters) gives an address to appear in the
              "From" address for alert mails.  This can be useful if you
              want to explicitly set a domain, as the default from
              address is "root" with no domain.  All words on this line
              are catenated with spaces to form the address.

              Note that this value cannot be set via the <i>mdadm</i>
              commandline.  It is only settable via the config file.
              There should only be one <b>MAILADDR </b>line and it should have
              only one address.  Any subsequent addresses are silently
              ignored.

       <b>PROGRAM</b>
              The <b>program </b>line gives the name of a program to be run
              when <b>mdadm --monitor </b>detects potentially interesting
              events on any of the arrays that it is monitoring.  This
              program gets run with two or three arguments, they being
              the Event, the md device, and possibly the related
              component device.

              There should only be one <b>program </b>line and it should be
              given only one program.  Any subsequent programs are
              silently ignored.

       <b>CREATE </b>The <b>create </b>line gives default values to be used when
              creating arrays, new members of arrays, and device entries
              for arrays.

              There should only be one <b>create </b>line.  Any subsequent
              lines will override the previous settings.

              Keywords used in the <i>CREATE</i> line and supported values are:

           <b>owner=</b>

           <b>group= </b>These can give user/group ids or names to use instead
                  of system defaults (root/wheel or root/disk).

           <b>mode=  </b>An octal file mode such as 0660 can be given to
                  override the default of 0600.

           <b>auto=  </b>This corresponds to the <b>--auto </b>flag to mdadm.  Give
                  <b>yes</b>, <b>md</b>, <b>mdp</b>, <b>part </b>â€” possibly followed by a number of
                  partitions â€” to indicate how missing device entries
                  should be created.

           <b>metadata=</b>
                  The name of the metadata format to use if none is
                  explicitly given.  This can be useful to impose a
                  system-wide default of version-1 superblocks.

           <b>names=yes</b>
                  Since Linux 2.6.29 it has been possible to create <b>md</b>
                  devices with a name like <b>md_home </b>rather than just a
                  number, like <b>md3</b>.  <i>mdadm</i> will use the numeric
                  alternative by default as other tools that interact
                  with md arrays may expect only numbers.  If <b>names=yes</b>
                  is given in <i>mdadm.conf</i> then <i>mdadm</i> will use a name when
                  appropriate.  If <b>names=no </b>is given, then non-numeric
                  <i>md</i> device names will not be used even if the default
                  changes in a future release of <i>mdadm</i>.

           <b>bbl=no </b>By default, <i>mdadm</i> will reserve space for a bad block
                  list (bbl) on all devices included in or added to any
                  array that supports them.  Setting <b>bbl=no </b>will prevent
                  this, so newly added devices will not have a bad block
                  log.

       <b>HOMEHOST</b>
              The <b>homehost </b>line gives a default value for the
              <b>--homehost= </b>option to mdadm.  There should normally be
              only one other word on the line.  It should either be a
              host name, or one of the special words <b>&lt;system&gt;, &lt;none&gt;</b>
              and <b>&lt;ignore&gt;</b>.  If <b>&lt;system&gt; </b>is given, then the
              <b>gethostname</b>(<b>2</b>) systemcall is used to get the host name.
              This is the default.

              If <b>&lt;ignore&gt; </b>is given, then a flag is set so that when
              arrays are being auto-assembled the checking of the
              recorded <i>homehost</i> is disabled.  If <b>&lt;ignore&gt; </b>is given it is
              also possible to give an explicit name which will be used
              when creating arrays.  This is the only case when there
              can be more that one other word on the <b>HOMEHOST </b>line.  If
              there are other words, or other <b>HOMEHOST </b>lines, they are
              silently ignored.

              If <b>&lt;none&gt; </b>is given, then the default of using
              <b>gethostname</b>(<b>2</b>) is over-ridden and no homehost name is
              assumed.

              When arrays are created, this host name will be stored in
              the metadata.  When arrays are assembled using auto-
              assembly, arrays which do not record the correct homehost
              name in their metadata will be assembled using a "foreign"
              name.  A "foreign" name alway ends with a digit string
              preceded by an underscore to differentiate it from any
              possible local name. e.g.  <b>/dev/md/1_1 </b>or <b>/dev/md/home_0</b>.

       <b>HOMECLUSTER</b>
              The <b>homcluster </b>line gives a default value for the
              <b>--homecluster= </b>option to mdadm.  It specifies  the
              cluster name for the md device.  The md device can be
              assembled only on the cluster which matches the name
              specified. If <b>homcluster </b>is not provided, mdadm tries to
              detect the cluster name automatically.

              There should only be one <b>homecluster </b>line.  Any subsequent
              lines will be silently ignored.

       <b>AUTO   </b>A list of names of metadata format can be given, each
              preceded by a plus or minus sign.  Also the word <i>homehost</i>
              is allowed as is <i>all</i> preceded by plus or minus sign.  <i>all</i>
              is usually last.

              When <i>mdadm</i> is auto-assembling an array, either via
              <i>--assemble</i> or <i>--incremental</i> and it finds metadata of a
              given type, it checks that metadata type against those
              listed in this line.  The first match wins, where <i>all</i>
              matches anything.  If a match is found that was preceded
              by a plus sign, the auto assembly is allowed.  If the
              match was preceded by a minus sign, the auto assembly is
              disallowed.  If no match is found, the auto assembly is
              allowed.

              If the metadata indicates that the array was created for
              <i>this</i> host, and the word <i>homehost</i> appears before any other
              match, then the array is treated as a valid candidate for
              auto-assembly.

              This can be used to disable all auto-assembly (so that
              only arrays explicitly listed in mdadm.conf or on the
              command line are assembled), or to disable assembly of
              certain metadata types which might be handled by other
              software.  It can also be used to disable assembly of all
              foreign arrays - normally such arrays are assembled but
              given a non-deterministic name in <b>/dev/md/</b>.

              The known metadata types are <b>0.90</b>, <b>1.x</b>, <b>ddf</b>, <b>imsm</b>.

              <b>AUTO </b>should be given at most once.  Subsequent lines are
              silently ignored.  Thus a later config file in a config
              directory will not overwrite the setting in an earlier
              config file.

       <b>POLICY </b>This is used to specify what automatic behavior is allowed
              on devices newly appearing in the system and provides a
              way of marking spares that can be moved to other arrays as
              well as the migration domains.  <i>Domain</i> can be defined
              through <i>policy</i> line by specifying a domain name for a
              number of paths from <b>/dev/disk/by-path/</b>.  A device may
              belong to several domains. The domain of an array is a
              union of domains of all devices in that array.  A spare
              can be automatically moved from one array to another if
              the set of the destination array's <i>domains</i> contains all
              the <i>domains</i> of the new disk or if both arrays have the
              same <i>spare-group</i>.

              To update hot plug configuration it is necessary to
              execute <b>mdadm --udev-rules </b>command after changing the
              config file

              Keywords used in the <i>POLICY</i> line and supported values are:

           <b>domain=</b>
                  any arbitrary string

           <b>metadata=</b>
                  0.9 1.x ddf or imsm

           <b>path=  </b>file glob matching anything from <b>/dev/disk/by-path</b>

           <b>type=  </b>either <b>disk </b>or <b>part</b>.

           <b>action=</b>
                  include, re-add, spare, spare-same-slot, or force-
                  spare

           <b>auto=  </b>yes, no, or homehost.

           The <i>action</i> item determines the automatic behavior allowed for
           devices matching the <i>path</i> and <i>type</i> in the same line.  If a
           device matches several lines with different <i>actions</i> then the
           most permissive will apply. The ordering of policy lines is
           irrelevant to the end result.

           <b>include</b>
                  allows adding a disk to an array if metadata on that
                  disk matches that array

           <b>re-add </b>will include the device in the array if it appears to
                  be a current member or a member that was recently
                  removed and the array has a write-intent-bitmap to
                  allow the <b>re-add </b>functionality.

           <b>spare  </b>as above and additionally: if the device is bare it
                  can become a spare if there is any array that it is a
                  candidate for based on domains and metadata.

           <b>spare-same-slot</b>
                  as above and additionally if given slot was used by an
                  array that went degraded recently and the device
                  plugged in has no metadata then it will be
                  automatically added to that array (or it's container)

           <b>force-spare</b>
                  as above and the disk will become a spare in remaining
                  cases

       <b>PART-POLICY</b>
              This is similar to <b>POLICY </b>and accepts the same keyword
              assignments.  It allows a consistent set of policies to
              applied to each of the partitions of a device.

              A <b>PART-POLICY </b>line should set <i>type=disk</i> and identify the
              path to one or more disk devices.  Each partition on these
              disks will be treated according to the <i>action=</i> setting
              from this line.  If a <i>domain</i> is set in the line, then the
              domain associated with each patition will be based on the
              domain, but with "<b>-part</b>N" appended, when N is the
              partition number for the partition that was found.

       <b>SYSFS  </b>The <b>SYSFS </b>line lists custom values of MD device's sysfs
              attributes which will be stored in sysfs after the array
              is assembled. Multiple lines are allowed and each line has
              to contain the uuid or the name of the device to which it
              relates.  Lines are applied in reverse order.

           <b>uuid=  </b>hexadecimal identifier of MD device. This has to match
                  the uuid stored in the superblock.

           <b>name=  </b>name of the MD device as was given to <i>mdadm</i> when the
                  array was created. It will be ignored if <b>uuid </b>is not
                  empty.

       <b>MONITORDELAY</b>
              The <b>monitordelay </b>line gives a delay in seconds <i>mdadm</i> shall
              wait before pooling md arrays when <i>mdadm</i> is running in
              <b>--monitor </b>mode.  <b>-d/--delay </b>command line argument takes
              precedence over the config file.

              If multiple <b>MINITORDELAY </b>lines are provided, only first
              non-zero value is considered.

       <b>ENCRYPTION_NO_VERIFY</b>
              The <b>ENCRYPTION_NO_VERIFY </b>disables encryption verification
              for devices with particular encryption support detected.
              Currently, only verification of SATA OPAL encryption can
              be disabled.  It does not disable ATA security encryption
              verification.  Currently effective only for <i>IMSM</i> metadata.
