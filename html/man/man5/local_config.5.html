NAME </h2>
<pre>
       Local_Config - Local_Config database schema

       This database is for local configuration of an ovsdb-server. The
       database is meant to be unique, even among multiple clustered db
       servers, so that configuration that is local to that server can
       be configured separately (e.g. Connection information).
</pre> <h2>
TABLE SUMMARY </h2>
<pre>
       The following list summarizes the purpose of each of the tables
       in the <b>Local_Config </b>database.  Each table is described in more
       detail on a later page.

       Table     Purpose
       <b>Config    </b>ovsdb-server configuration
       <b>Connection</b>
                 OVSDB client connections.
</pre> <h2>
Config TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       The root local configuration table for an ovsdb-server. This
       table must have exactly one row.

              should connect or on which it should listen, along with
              options for how these connections should be configured.
              See the <b>Connection </b>table for more information.
</pre> <h2>
Connection TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Configuration for a database connection to an Open vSwitch
       database (OVSDB) client.

       This table primarily configures the Open vSwitch database server
       (<b>ovsdb-server</b>).

       The Open vSwitch database server can initiate and maintain active
       connections to remote clients. It can also listen for database
       connections.

       <b>target</b>: string (must be unique within table)
              Connection methods for clients.

              The following connection methods are currently supported:

              <b>ssl:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified SSL <i>port</i> on the host at the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address. A valid SSL
                     configuration must be provided when this form is
                     used, this configuration can be specified via
                     command-line options or the <b>SSL </b>table.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not
                     always built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>tcp:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified TCP <i>port</i> on the host at the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address. If <i>host</i> is an
                     IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[::1]:6640</b>.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              <b>pssl:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for SSL connections on the specified TCP
                     <i>port</i>. Specify 0 for <i>port</i> to have the kernel
                     automatically choose an available port. If <i>host</i>,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address, is specified,
                     then connections are restricted to the resolved or
                     specified local IPaddress (either IPv4 or IPv6
                     address). If <i>host</i> is an IPv6 address, wrap in
                     square brackets, e.g. <b>pssl:6640:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is
                     not specified then it listens only on IPv4 (but not
                     IPv6) addresses. A valid SSL configuration must be
                     provided when this form is used, this can be
                     specified either via command-line options or the
                     <b>SSL </b>table.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL support is an optional feature that is not
                     always built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>ptcp:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for connections on the specified TCP <i>port</i>.
                     Specify 0 for <i>port</i> to have the kernel automatically
                     choose an available port. If <i>host</i>, which can either
                     be a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or an
                     IP address, is specified, then connections are
                     restricted to the resolved or specified local IP
                     address (either IPv4 or IPv6 address). If <i>host</i> is
                     an IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g.
                     <b>ptcp:6640:[::1]</b>. If <i>host</i> is not specified then it
                     listens only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              When multiple clients are configured, the <b>target </b>values
              must be unique. Duplicate <b>target </b>values yield unspecified
              results.

       <b>read_only</b>: boolean
              <b>true </b>to restrict these connections to read-only
              transactions, <b>false </b>to allow them to modify the database.

       <b>role</b>: string
              String containing role name for this connection entry.

     <i>Client Failure Detection and Handling:</i>

       <b>max_backoff</b>: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection
              attempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       <b>inactivity_probe</b>: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection
              to the client before sending an inactivity probe message.
              If Open vSwitch does not communicate with the client for
              the specified number of seconds, it will send a probe. If
              a response is not received for the same additional amount
              of time, Open vSwitch assumes the connection has been
              broken and attempts to reconnect. Default is
              implementation-specific. A value of 0 disables inactivity
              probes.

     <i>Status:</i>

       Key-value pair of <b>is_connected </b>is always updated. Other key-value
       pairs in the status columns may be updated depends on the <b>target</b>
       type.

       When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
       inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>punix:</b>), both <b>n_connections</b>
       and <b>is_connected </b>may also be updated while the remaining key-
       value pairs are omitted.

       On the other hand, when <b>target </b>specifies an outbound connection,
       all key-value pairs may be updated, except the above-mentioned
       two key-value pairs associated with inbound connection targets.
       They are omitted.

       <b>is_connected</b>: boolean
              <b>true </b>if currently connected to this client, <b>false</b>
              otherwise.

       <b>status : last_error</b>: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the
              connection to the manager; i.e. <b>strerror(errno)</b>. This key
              will exist only if an error has occurred.

       <b>status : state</b>: optional string, one of <b>ACTIVE</b>, <b>BACKOFF</b>,
       <b>CONNECTING</b>, <b>IDLE</b>, or <b>VOID</b>
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              <b>VOID   </b>Connection is disabled.

              <b>BACKOFF</b>
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              <b>CONNECTING</b>
                     Attempting to connect.

              <b>ACTIVE </b>Connected, remote host responsive.

              <b>IDLE   </b>Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-
                     alive.

              These values may change in the future. They are provided
              only for human consumption.

       <b>status : sec_since_connect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last successfully
              connected to the database (in seconds). Value is empty if
              client has never successfully been connected.

       <b>status : sec_since_disconnect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last disconnected
              from the database (in seconds). Value is empty if client
              has never disconnected.

       <b>status : locks_held</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection holds. Omitted if the connection does not hold
              any locks.

       <b>status : locks_waiting</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection is currently waiting to acquire. Omitted if the
              connection is not waiting for any locks.

       <b>status : locks_lost</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection has had stolen by another OVSDB client. Omitted
              if no locks have been stolen from this connection.

       <b>status : n_connections</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 2
              When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
              inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>) and more than
              one connection is actually active, the value is the number
              of active connections. Otherwise, this key-value pair is
              omitted.

       <b>status : bound_port</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              When <b>target </b>is <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>, this is the TCP port on
              which the OVSDB server is listening. (This is particularly
              useful when <b>target </b>specifies a port of 0, allowing the
              kernel to choose any available port.)

     <i>Connection Parameters:</i>

       <b>other_config : dscp</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) is specified
              using 6 bits in the Type of Service (TOS) field in the IP
              header. DSCP provides a mechanism to classify the network
              traffic and provide Quality of Service (QoS) on IP
              networks. The DSCP value specified here is used when
              establishing the connection between the manager and the
              Open vSwitch. If no value is specified, a default value of
              48 is chosen. Valid DSCP values must be in the range 0 to
              63.

     <i>Configuration:</i>

       External configuration options

       <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs
              External client-defined key-value pairs
