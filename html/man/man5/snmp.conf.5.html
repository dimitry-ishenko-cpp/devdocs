</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       snmp.conf - snmp configuration file for cups (deprecated)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>snmp.conf </b>file configures how the standard CUPS network
       backends (http, https, ipp, ipps, lpd, snmp, and socket) access
       printer information using SNMPv1 and is normally located in the
       <i>/etc/cups</i> directory.  Each line in the file can be a
       configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment
       lines start with the # character.

       The Community and DebugLevel directives are used by all backends.
       The remainder apply only to the SNMP backend - <a href="../man8/cups-snmp.8.html">cups-snmp(8)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
DIRECTIVES </h2>
<pre>
       The following directives are understood by the CUPS network
       backends:

       <b>Address @IF(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b>

       <b>Address @LOCAL</b>

       <b>Address </b><i>address</i>
            Sends SNMP broadcast queries (for discovery) to the
            specified address(es).  There is no default for the
            broadcast address.

       <b>Community </b><i>name</i>
            Specifies the community name to use.  Only a single
            community name may be specified.  The default community name
            is "public".  If no name is specified, all SNMP functions
            are disabled.

       <b>DebugLevel </b><i>number</i>
            Specifies the logging level from 0 (none) to 3 (everything).
            Typically only used for debugging (thus the name).  The
            default debug level is 0.

       <b>DeviceURI "</b><i>regular expression</i><b>" </b><i>device-uri</i> [... <i>device-uri</i>]
            Specifies one or more device URIs that should be used for a
            given make and model string.  The regular expression is used
            to match the detected make and model, and the device URI
            strings must be of the form "scheme://%s[:port]/[path]",
            where "%s" represents the detected address or hostname.
            There are no default device URI matching rules.

       <b>HostNameLookups on</b>

       <b>HostNameLookups off</b>
            Specifies whether the addresses of printers should be
            converted to hostnames or left as numeric IP addresses.  The
            default is "off".

       <b>MaxRunTime </b><i>seconds</i>
            Specifies the maximum number of seconds that the SNMP
            backend will scan the network for printers.  The default is
            120 seconds (2 minutes).
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       CUPS backends are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a
       future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP
       can be supported using applications such as <a href="../man1/ippeveprinter.1.html">ippeveprinter(1)</a>.
