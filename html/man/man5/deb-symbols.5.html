NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-symbols - Debian's extended shared library information file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DEBIAN/symbols</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The symbol files are shipped in Debian binary packages, and its
       format is a subset of the template symbol files used by
       <a href="../man1/dpkg-gensymbols.1.html">dpkg-gensymbols(1)</a> in Debian source packages, see
       <a href="deb-src-symbols.5.html">deb-src-symbols(5)</a>.

       The format for an extended shared library dependency information
       entry in these files is:

        <i>library-soname main-dependency-template</i>
        [| <i>alternative-dependency-template</i>]
        [...]
        [* <i>field-name</i>: <i>field-value</i>]
        [...]
         <i>symbol minimal-version</i> [<i>id-of-dependency-template</i>]

       The <i>library-soname</i> is exactly the value of the SONAME field as
       exported by <a href="../man1/objdump.1.html">objdump(1)</a>.  A <i>dependency-template</i> is a dependency
       where <i>#MINVER#</i> is dynamically replaced either by a version check
       like “(&gt;= <i>minimal-version</i>)” or by nothing (if an unversioned
       dependency is deemed sufficient).

       Each exported <i>symbol</i> (listed as <i>name</i>@<i>version</i>, with <i>version</i> being
       “Base” if the library is not versioned) is associated to a
       <i>minimal-version</i> of its dependency template (the main dependency
       template is always used and will end up being combined with the
       dependency template referenced by <i>id-of-dependency-template</i> if
       present).  The first alternative dependency template is numbered
       1, the second one 2, etc.  Each column is separated by exactly a
       single whitespace.

       Each entry for a library can also have some fields of meta-
       information.  Those fields are stored on lines starting with an
       asterisk.  Currently, the only valid fields are:

       <b>Build-Depends-Package</b>
           It indicates the name of the “-dev” package associated to the
           library and is used by <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>to make sure that the
           dependency generated is at least as strict as the
           corresponding build dependency (since dpkg 1.14.13).

       <b>Build-Depends-Packages</b>
           The same as <b>Build-Depends-Package </b>but accepts a comma-
           separated list of package names (since dpkg 1.20.0).  This
           field will override any <b>Build-Depends-Package </b>field present,
           and is mostly useful with “-dev” packages and metapackages
           depending on these, say for a transition period.

       <b>Allow-Internal-Symbol-Groups</b>
           It indicates what internal symbol groups should be ignored,
           as a whitespace separated list, so that the symbols contained
           in those groups get included in the output file (since dpkg
           1.20.1).  This should only be necessary for toolchain
           packages providing those internal symbols.  The available
           groups are system dependent, for ELF and GNU-based systems
           these are <b>aeabi </b>and <b>gomp</b>.

       <b>Ignore-Blacklist-Groups</b>
           A deprecated alias for <b>Allow-Internal-Symbol-Groups </b>(since
           dpkg 1.20.1, supported since dpkg 1.17.6).
