NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-override - Debian archive override file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>override</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       While most information about a package can be found in the
       control file, some is managed centrally by the distribution czars
       rather than by the maintainer in order to offer some global
       consistency.  This information is found in the override file.

       The override file has a simple whitespace-delimited format.
       Comments are allowed (denoted with a <b>#</b>).

           <i>package priority section</i> [<i>maintainer-info</i>]

       <i>package</i> is the name of the package.  Entries in the override file
       for packages not found in the tree of binary packages are
       ignored.

       <i>priority</i> and <i>section</i> correspond to the respective control fields
       available in the .deb.  The allowed values are specific to each
       distribution archive.

       <i>maintainer-info</i>, if present, can be either the name of a
       maintainer for an unconditional override, or else <i>old-maintainer</i>
       <b>=&gt; </b><i>new-maintainer</i> to perform a substitution.

       The override files used to make the official Packages lists may
       be found in the <i>indices</i> directory on any Debian mirror.
