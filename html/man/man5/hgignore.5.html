NAME </h2>
<pre>
       hgignore - syntax for Mercurial ignore files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       The Mercurial system uses a file called <b>.hgignore </b>in the root
       directory of a repository to control its behavior when it
       searches for files that it is not currently tracking.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The working directory of a Mercurial repository will often
       contain files that should not be tracked by Mercurial. These
       include backup files created by editors and build products
       created by compilers.  These files can be ignored by listing them
       in a <b>.hgignore </b>file in the root of the working directory. The
       <b>.hgignore </b>file must be created manually. It is typically put
       under version control, so that the settings will propagate to
       other repositories with push and pull.

       An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the
       repository root directory, or any prefix path of that path, is
       matched against any pattern in <b>.hgignore</b>.

       For example, say we have an untracked file, <b>file.c</b>, at <b>a/b/file.c</b>
       inside our repository. Mercurial will ignore <b>file.c </b>if any
       pattern in <b>.hgignore </b>matches <b>a/b/file.c</b>, <b>a/b </b>or <b>a</b>.

       In addition, a Mercurial configuration file can reference a set
       of per-user or global ignore files. See the <b>ignore </b>configuration
       key on the <b>[ui] </b>section of <b>hg help config </b>for details of how to
       configure these files.

       To control Mercurial's handling of files that it manages, many
       commands support the <b>-I </b>and <b>-X </b>options; see <b>hg help &lt;command&gt; </b>and
       <b>hg help patterns </b>for details.

       Files that are already tracked are not affected by .hgignore,
       even if they appear in .hgignore. An untracked file X can be
       explicitly added with <b>hg add X</b>, even if X would be excluded by a
       pattern in .hgignore.
</pre> <h2>
SYNTAX </h2>
<pre>
       An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of a list of
       patterns, with one pattern per line. Empty lines are skipped. The
       <b># </b>character is treated as a comment character, and the <b>\</b>
       character is treated as an escape character.

       Mercurial supports several pattern syntaxes. The default syntax
       used is Python/Perl-style regular expressions.

       To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form:

       syntax: NAME

       where <b>NAME </b>is one of the following:

       <b>regexp</b>

              Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.

       <b>glob</b>

              Shell-style glob.

       <b>rootglob</b>

              A variant of <b>glob </b>that is rooted (see below).

       The chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all patterns that
       follow, until another syntax is selected.

       Neither <b>glob </b>nor regexp patterns are rooted. A glob-syntax
       pattern of the form <b>*.c </b>will match a file ending in <b>.c </b>in any
       directory, and a regexp pattern of the form <b>\.c$ </b>will do the
       same. To root a regexp pattern, start it with <b>^</b>. To get the same
       effect with glob-syntax, you have to use <b>rootglob</b>.

       Subdirectories can have their own .hgignore settings by adding
       <b>subinclude:path/to/subdir/.hgignore </b>to the root <b>.hgignore</b>. See <b>hg</b>
       <b>help patterns </b>for details on <b>subinclude: </b>and <b>include:</b>.

       Note   Patterns specified in other than <b>.hgignore </b>are always
              rooted.  Please see <b>hg help patterns </b>for details.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       Here is an example ignore file.

       # use glob syntax.
       syntax: glob

       *.elc
       *.pyc
       *~

       # switch to regexp syntax.
       syntax: regexp
       ^\.pc/
</pre> <h2>
DEBUGGING </h2>
<pre>
       Use the <b>debugignore </b>command to see if and why a file is ignored,
       or to see the combined ignore pattern. See <b>hg help debugignore</b>
       for details.
