NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd.netdev - Virtual Network Device configuration
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>netdev</i>.netdev
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A plain ini-style text file that encodes configuration about a
       virtual network device, used by <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.8.html">systemd-networkd(8)</a>. See
       <a href="../man7/systemd.syntax.7.html">systemd.syntax(7)</a> for a general description of the syntax.

       The main Virtual Network Device file must have the extension
       .netdev; other extensions are ignored. Virtual network devices
       are created as soon as networkd is started. If a netdev with the
       specified name already exists, networkd will use that as-is
       rather than create its own. Note that the settings of the
       pre-existing netdev will not be changed by networkd.

       The .netdev files are read from the files located in the system
       network directory /usr/lib/systemd/network and
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network
       directory /run/systemd/network and the local administration
       network directory /etc/systemd/network. All configuration files
       are collectively sorted and processed in alphanumeric order,
       regardless of the directories in which they live. However, files
       with identical filenames replace each other. It is recommended
       that each filename is prefixed with a number smaller than "70"
       (e.g.  10-vlan.netdev). Otherwise, .netdev files generated by
       <a href="../man8/systemd-network-generator.service.8.html">systemd-network-generator.service(8)</a> may take precedence over
       user configured files. Files in /etc/ have the highest priority,
       files in /run/ take precedence over files with the same name in
       /usr/lib/. This can be used to override a system-supplied
       configuration file with a local file if needed. As a special
       case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name
       pointing to /dev/null disables the configuration file entirely
       (it is "masked").

       Along with the netdev file foo.netdev, a "drop-in" directory
       foo.netdev.d/ may exist. All files with the suffix ".conf" from
       this directory will be merged in the alphanumeric order and
       parsed after the main file itself has been parsed. This is useful
       to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify
       the main configuration file. Each drop-in file must have
       appropriate section headers.

       In addition to /etc/systemd/network, drop-in ".d" directories can
       be placed in /usr/lib/systemd/network or /run/systemd/network
       directories. Drop-in files in /etc/ take precedence over those in
       /run/ which in turn take precedence over those in /usr/lib/.
       Drop-in files under any of these directories take precedence over
       the main netdev file wherever located. (Of course, since /run/ is
       temporary and /usr/lib/ is for vendors, it is unlikely drop-ins
       should be used in either of those places.)

[NETDEV] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [NetDev] section accepts the following keys:

       <i>Description=</i>
           A free-form description of the netdev.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>Name=</i>
           The interface name used when creating the netdev. This
           setting is compulsory.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>Kind=</i>
           The netdev kind. This setting is compulsory. See the
           "Supported netdev kinds" section for the valid keys.

           Added in version 211.

       <i>MTUBytes=</i>
           The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the device.
           The usual suffixes K, M, G are supported and are understood
           to the base of 1024. For "tun" or "tap" devices, <i>MTUBytes=</i>
           setting is not currently supported in [NetDev] section.
           Please specify it in [Link] section of corresponding
           <a href="systemd.network.5.html">systemd.network(5)</a> files.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>MACAddress=</i>
           Specifies the MAC address to use for the device, or takes the
           special value "none". When "none", <b>systemd-networkd </b>does not
           request the MAC address for the device, and the kernel will
           assign a random MAC address. For "tun", "tap", or "l2tp"
           devices, the <i>MACAddress=</i> setting in the [NetDev] section is
           not supported and will be ignored. Please specify it in the
           [Link] section of the corresponding <a href="systemd.network.5.html">systemd.network(5)</a> file.
           If this option is not set, "vlan" device inherits the MAC
           address of the master interface. For other kind of netdevs,
           if this option is not set, then the MAC address is generated
           based on the interface name and the <a href="machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a>.

           Note, even if "none" is specified, <b>systemd-udevd </b>will assign
           the persistent MAC address for the device, as 99-default.link
           has <i>MACAddressPolicy=persistent</i>. So, it is also necessary to
           create a custom .link file for the device, if the MAC address
           assignment is not desired.

           Added in version 215.
</pre> <h2>

           about the topology throughout the entire bridged local area
           network.

           Added in version 227.

       <i>MaxAgeSec=</i>
           MaxAgeSec specifies the number of seconds of maximum message
           age. If the last seen (received) hello packet is more than
           this number of seconds old, the bridge in question will start
           the takeover procedure in attempt to become the Root Bridge
           itself.

           Added in version 227.

       <i>ForwardDelaySec=</i>
           ForwardDelaySec specifies the number of seconds spent in each
           of the Listening and Learning states before the Forwarding
           state is entered.

           Added in version 227.

       <i>AgeingTimeSec=</i>
           This specifies the number of seconds a MAC Address will be
           kept in the forwarding database after having a packet
           received from this MAC Address.

           Added in version 232.

       <i>Priority=</i>
           The priority of the bridge. An integer between 0 and 65535. A

       <i>GroupForwardMask=</i>
           A 16-bit bitmask represented as an integer which allows
           forwarding of link local frames with 802.1D reserved
           addresses (01:80:C2:00:00:0X). A logical AND is performed
           between the specified bitmask and the exponentiation of 2^X,
           the lower nibble of the last octet of the MAC address. For
           example, a value of 8 would allow forwarding of frames
           addressed to 01:80:C2:00:00:03 (802.1X PAE).

           Added in version 235.

       <i>DefaultPVID=</i>
           This specifies the default port VLAN ID of a newly attached

       <i>MulticastQuerier=</i>
           Takes a boolean. This setting controls the
           IFLA_BR_MCAST_QUERIER option in the kernel. If enabled, the
           kernel will send general ICMP queries from a zero source
           address. This feature should allow faster convergence on
           startup, but it causes some multicast-aware switches to
           misbehave and disrupt forwarding of multicast packets. When
           unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 230.

       <i>MulticastSnooping=</i>

           Added in version 231.

       <i>VLANProtocol=</i>
           Allows setting the protocol used for VLAN filtering. Takes
           <b>802.1q </b>or, <b>802.1ad</b>, and defaults to unset and kernel's
           default is used.

           Added in version 246.

       <i>STP=</i>
           Takes a boolean. This enables the bridge's Spanning Tree
           Protocol (STP). When unset, the kernel's default will be
           used.

           Added in version 232.

       <i>MulticastIGMPVersion=</i>
           Allows changing bridge's multicast Internet Group Management
           Protocol (IGMP) version. Takes an integer 2 or 3. When unset,

           Takes a boolean value, or "inherit". Set to "inherit" if the
           encapsulated protocol is IPv6. When unset, the kernel's
           default will be used.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>Independent=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the vxlan interface is created
           without any underlying network interface. Defaults to false,
           which means that a .network file that requests this VXLAN
           interface using <i>VXLAN=</i> is required for the VXLAN to be
           created.

           either.

           Added in version 219.

       <i>Independent=</i>
           Takes a boolean. When false (the default), the tunnel is
           always created over some network device, and a .network file
           that requests this tunnel using <i>Tunnel=</i> is required for the
           tunnel to be created. When true, the tunnel is created
           independently of any network as "tunnel@NONE".

           Added in version 235.

       <i>AssignToLoopback=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set to "yes", the loopback interface "lo"

           Added in version 240.

       <i>FOUSourcePort=</i>
           This setting specifies the UDP source port for encapsulation.
           Defaults to <b>0 </b>— that is, the source port for packets is left
           to the network stack to decide.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>Encapsulation=</i>
           Accepts the same key as in the [FooOverUDP] section.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>IPv6RapidDeploymentPrefix=</i>
           Reconfigure the tunnel for <b>IPv6 Rapid Deployment</b>[16], also
           known as 6rd. The value is an ISP-specific IPv6 prefix with a
           non-zero length. Only applicable to SIT tunnels.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>ISATAP=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If set, configures the tunnel as Intra-Site
           Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) tunnel. Only
           applicable to SIT tunnels. When unset, the kernel's default

[FOOOVERUDP] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [FooOverUDP] section only applies for netdevs of kind "fou"
       and accepts the following keys:

       <i>Encapsulation=</i>
           Specifies the encapsulation mechanism used to store
           networking packets of various protocols inside the UDP
           packets. Supports the following values: "FooOverUDP" provides
           the simplest no-frills model of UDP encapsulation, it simply
           encapsulates packets directly in the UDP payload.
           "GenericUDPEncapsulation" is a generic and extensible
           encapsulation, it allows encapsulation of packets for any IP
           protocol and optional data as part of the encapsulation. For
           more detailed information see <b>Generic UDP Encapsulation</b>[17].
           Defaults to "FooOverUDP".

           Added in version 240.

       <i>Port=</i>
           Specifies the port number where the encapsulated packets will
           arrive. Those packets will be removed and manually fed back
           into the network stack with the encapsulation removed to be
           sent to the real destination. This option is mandatory.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>PeerPort=</i>
           Specifies the peer port number. Defaults to unset. Note that
           when peer port is set "Peer=" address is mandatory.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>Protocol=</i>
           The <i>Protocol=</i> specifies the protocol number of the packets
           arriving at the UDP port. When <i>Encapsulation=FooOverUDP</i>, this
           field is mandatory and is not set by default. Takes an IP
           protocol name such as "gre" or "ipip", or an integer within
           the range 1...255. When
           <i>Encapsulation=GenericUDPEncapsulation</i>, this must not be
           specified.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>Peer=</i>
           Configures peer IP address. Note that when peer address is
           set "PeerPort=" is mandatory.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>Local=</i>
           Configures local IP address.

           Added in version 243.
</pre> <h2>

       The [Peer] section only applies for netdevs of kind "veth" and
       accepts the following keys:

       <i>Name=</i>
           The interface name used when creating the netdev. This
           setting is compulsory.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>MACAddress=</i>
           The peer MACAddress, if not set, it is generated in the same
           way as the MAC address of the main interface.

           Added in version 215.
</pre> <h2>
[VXCAN] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [VXCAN] section only applies for netdevs of kind "vxcan" and
       accepts the following key:

       <i>Peer=</i>
           The peer interface name used when creating the netdev. This
           setting is compulsory.

           Added in version 236.
</pre> <h2>
[TUN] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [Tun] section only applies for netdevs of kind "tun", and
       accepts the following keys:

       <i>MultiQueue=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures whether to use multiple file
           descriptors (queues) to parallelize packets sending and
           receiving. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 215.

       <i>PacketInfo=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures whether packets should be
           prepended with four extra bytes (two flag bytes and two
           protocol bytes). If disabled, it indicates that the packets
           will be pure IP packets. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 215.

       <i>VNetHeader=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Configures IFF_VNET_HDR flag for a tun or
           tap device. It allows sending and receiving larger Generic
           Segmentation Offload (GSO) packets. This may increase
           throughput significantly. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 223.

       <i>User=</i>
           User to grant access to the /dev/net/tun device.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>Group=</i>
           Group to grant access to the /dev/net/tun device.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>KeepCarrier=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If enabled, to make the interface maintain
           its carrier status, the file descriptor of the interface is
           kept open. This may be useful to keep the interface in
           running state, for example while the backing process is
           temporarily shutdown. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 252.
</pre> <h2>
[TAP] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [Tap] section only applies for netdevs of kind "tap", and
       accepts the same keys as the [Tun] section.
</pre> <h2>
[WIREGUARD] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [WireGuard] section accepts the following keys:

       <i>PrivateKey=</i>
           The Base64 encoded private key for the interface. It can be
           generated using the <b>wg genkey </b>command (see <a href="../man8/wg.8.html">wg(8)</a>). Specially,
           if the specified key is prefixed with "@", it is interpreted
           as the name of the credential from which the actual key shall
           be read.  <b>systemd-networkd.service </b>automatically imports
           credentials matching "network.wireguard.*". For more details
           on credentials, refer to <a href="systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a>. A private key is
           mandatory to use WireGuard. If not set, the credential
           "network.wireguard.private.<i>netdev</i>" is used if exists. I.e.
           for 50-foobar.netdev, "network.wireguard.private.50-foobar"
           is tried.

           Note that because this information is secret, it's strongly
           recommended to use an (encrypted) credential. Alternatively,
           you may want to set the permissions of the .netdev file to be
           owned by "root:systemd-network" with a "0640" file mode.

           Added in version 237.

       <i>PrivateKeyFile=</i>
           Takes an absolute path to a file which contains the Base64
           encoded private key for the interface. When this option is
           specified, then <i>PrivateKey=</i> is ignored. Note that the file
           must be readable by the user "systemd-network", so it should
           be, e.g., owned by "root:systemd-network" with a "0640" file
           mode. If the path refers to an <b>AF_UNIX </b>stream socket in the
           file system a connection is made to it and the key read from
           it.

           Added in version 242.

       <i>ListenPort=</i>
           Sets UDP port for listening. Takes either value between 1 and
           65535 or "auto". If "auto" is specified, the port is
           automatically generated based on interface name. Defaults to
           "auto".

           Added in version 237.

       <i>FirewallMark=</i>
           Sets a firewall mark on outgoing WireGuard packets from this
           interface. Takes a number between 1 and 4294967295.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>RouteTable=</i>
           The table identifier for the routes to the addresses
           specified in the <i>AllowedIPs=</i>. Takes a negative boolean value,
           one of the predefined names "default", "main", and "local",
           names defined in <i>RouteTable=</i> in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>, or a number
           in the range 1...4294967295. When "off" the routes to the
           addresses specified in the <i>AllowedIPs=</i> setting will not be
           configured. Defaults to false. This setting will be ignored
           when the same setting is specified in the [WireGuardPeer]
           section.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>RouteMetric=</i>
           The priority of the routes to the addresses specified in the
           <i>AllowedIPs=</i>. Takes an integer in the range 0...4294967295.
           Defaults to 0 for IPv4 addresses, and 1024 for IPv6
           addresses. This setting will be ignored when the same setting
           is specified in the [WireGuardPeer] section.

           Added in version 250.
</pre> <h2>
[WIREGUARDPEER] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [WireGuardPeer] section accepts the following keys:

       <i>PublicKey=</i>
           Sets a Base64 encoded public key calculated by <b>wg pubkey </b>(see
           <a href="../man8/wg.8.html">wg(8)</a>) from a private key, and usually transmitted out of
           band to the author of the configuration file. This option
           honors the "@" prefix in the same way as the <b>PrivateKey=</b>
           setting of the <b>[WireGuard] </b>section. This option is mandatory
           for this section.

           Added in version 237.

       <i>PresharedKey=</i>
           Optional preshared key for the interface. It can be generated
           by the <b>wg genpsk </b>command. This option adds an additional
           layer of symmetric-key cryptography to be mixed into the
           already existing public-key cryptography, for post-quantum
           resistance. This option honors the "@" prefix in the same way
           as the <b>PrivateKey= </b>setting of the <b>[WireGuard] </b>section.

           Note that because this information is secret, it's strongly
           recommended to use an (encrypted) credential. Alternatively,
           you may want to set the permissions of the .netdev file to be
           owned by "root:systemd-network" with a "0640" file mode.

           Added in version 237.

       <i>PresharedKeyFile=</i>
           Takes an absolute path to a file which contains the Base64
           encoded preshared key for the peer. When this option is
           specified, then <i>PresharedKey=</i> is ignored. Note that the file
           must be readable by the user "systemd-network", so it should
           be, e.g., owned by "root:systemd-network" with a "0640" file
           mode. If the path refers to an <b>AF_UNIX </b>stream socket in the
           file system a connection is made to it and the key read from
           it.

           Added in version 242.

       <i>AllowedIPs=</i>
           Sets a comma-separated list of IP (v4 or v6) addresses with
           CIDR masks from which this peer is allowed to send incoming
           traffic and to which outgoing traffic for this peer is
           directed. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an
           empty string is assigned, then the all previous assignments
           are cleared.

           The catch-all 0.0.0.0/0 may be specified for matching all
           IPv4 addresses, and ::/0 may be specified for matching all
           IPv6 addresses.

           Note that this only affects <i>routing inside the network</i>
           <i>interface itself</i>, i.e. the packets that pass through the
           tunnel itself. To cause packets to be sent via the tunnel in
           the first place, an appropriate route needs to be added as
           well — either in the "[Routes]" section on the ".network"
           matching the wireguard interface, or externally to
           systemd-networkd.

           Added in version 237.

       <i>Endpoint=</i>
           Sets an endpoint IP address or hostname, followed by a colon,
           and then a port number. IPv6 address must be in the square
           brackets. For example, "111.222.333.444:51820" for IPv4 and
           "[1111:2222::3333]:51820" for IPv6 address. This endpoint
           will be updated automatically once to the most recent source
           IP address and port of correctly authenticated packets from
           the peer at configuration time.

           This option honors the "@" prefix in the same way as the
           <b>PrivateKey= </b>setting of the <b>[WireGuard] </b>section.

           Added in version 237.

       <i>PersistentKeepalive=</i>
           Sets a seconds interval, between 1 and 65535 inclusive, of
           how often to send an authenticated empty packet to the peer
           for the purpose of keeping a stateful firewall or NAT mapping
           valid persistently. For example, if the interface very rarely
           sends traffic, but it might at anytime receive traffic from a
           peer, and it is behind NAT, the interface might benefit from
           having a persistent keepalive interval of 25 seconds. If set
           to 0 or "off", this option is disabled. By default or when
           unspecified, this option is off. Most users will not need
           this.

           Added in version 237.

       <i>RouteTable=</i>
           The table identifier for the routes to the addresses
           specified in the <i>AllowedIPs=</i>. Takes a negative boolean value,
           one of the predefined names "default", "main", and "local",
           names defined in <i>RouteTable=</i> in <a href="networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a>, or a number
           in the range 1...4294967295. Defaults to unset, and the value
           specified in the same setting in the [WireGuard] section will
           be used.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>RouteMetric=</i>
           The priority of the routes to the addresses specified in the
           <i>AllowedIPs=</i>. Takes an integer in the range 0...4294967295.
           Defaults to unset, and the value specified in the same
           setting in the [WireGuard] section will be used.

           Added in version 250.

           transmit LACPDUs every 30 seconds, and "fast", which requests
           partner to transmit LACPDUs every second. The default value
           is "slow".

           Added in version 216.

       <i>MIIMonitorSec=</i>
           Specifies the frequency that Media Independent Interface link
           monitoring will occur. A value of zero disables MII link

           Added in version 256.

       <i>UpDelaySec=</i>
           Specifies the delay before a link is enabled after a link up

           Added in version 220.

       <i>AdActorSystemPriority=</i>
           Specifies the 802.3ad actor system priority. Takes a number
           in the range 1...65535.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>AdUserPortKey=</i>
           Specifies the 802.3ad user defined portion of the port key.
           Takes a number in the range 0...1023.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>AdActorSystem=</i>
           Specifies the 802.3ad system MAC address. This cannot be a
           null or multicast address.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>FailOverMACPolicy=</i>
           Specifies whether the active-backup mode should set all
           slaves to the same MAC address at the time of enslavement or,
           when enabled, to perform special handling of the bond's MAC
           address in accordance with the selected policy. The default
           policy is none. Possible values are "none", "active" and
           "follow".

           Added in version 220.

       <i>ARPValidate=</i>
           Specifies whether or not ARP probes and replies should be
           validated in any mode that supports ARP monitoring, or
           whether non-ARP traffic should be filtered (disregarded) for
           link monitoring purposes. Possible values are "none",
           "active", "backup" and "all".

           Added in version 220.

       <i>ARPIntervalSec=</i>
           Specifies the ARP link monitoring frequency. A value of 0
           disables ARP monitoring. The default value is 0, and the
           default unit seconds.

           Added in version 220.

       <i>ARPIPTargets=</i>
           Specifies the IP addresses to use as ARP monitoring peers
           when <i>ARPIntervalSec=</i> is greater than 0. These are the targets
           of the ARP request sent to determine the health of the link
           to the targets. Specify these values in IPv4 dotted decimal
           format. At least one IP address must be given for ARP
           monitoring to function. The maximum number of targets that
           can be specified is 16. The default value is no IP addresses.

           Added in version 220.

       <i>ARPAllTargets=</i>
           Specifies the quantity of <i>ARPIPTargets=</i> that must be
           reachable in order for the ARP monitor to consider a slave as
           being up. This option affects only active-backup mode for
           slaves with ARPValidate enabled. Possible values are "any"
           and "all".

           Added in version 220.

       <i>PrimaryReselectPolicy=</i>
           Specifies the reselection policy for the primary slave. This
           affects how the primary slave is chosen to become the active
           slave when failure of the active slave or recovery of the
           primary slave occurs. This option is designed to prevent
           flip-flopping between the primary slave and other slaves.
           Possible values are "always", "better" and "failure".

           Added in version 220.

       <i>ResendIGMP=</i>
           Specifies the number of IGMP membership reports to be issued
           after a failover event. One membership report is issued
           immediately after the failover, subsequent packets are sent
           in each 200ms interval. The valid range is 0...255. Defaults
           to 1. A value of 0 prevents the IGMP membership report from
           being issued in response to the failover event.

           Added in version 220.

       <i>PacketsPerSlave=</i>
           Specify the number of packets to transmit through a slave
           before moving to the next one. When set to 0, then a slave is
           chosen at random. The valid range is 0...65535. Defaults to
           1. This option only has effect when in balance-rr mode.

           Added in version 220.

       <i>GratuitousARP=</i>
           Specify the number of peer notifications (gratuitous ARPs and
           unsolicited IPv6 Neighbor Advertisements) to be issued after
           a failover event. As soon as the link is up on the new slave,
           a peer notification is sent on the bonding device and each
           VLAN sub-device. This is repeated at each link monitor
           interval (ARPIntervalSec or MIIMonitorSec, whichever is
           active) if the number is greater than 1. The valid range is
           0...255. The default value is 1. These options affect only
           the active-backup mode.

           Added in version 220.

       <i>AllSlavesActive=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Specifies that duplicate frames (received on
           inactive ports) should be dropped when false, or delivered
           when true. Normally, bonding will drop duplicate frames
           (received on inactive ports), which is desirable for most
           users. But there are some times it is nice to allow duplicate
           frames to be delivered. The default value is false (drop
           duplicate frames received on inactive ports).

           Added in version 220.

       <i>DynamicTransmitLoadBalancing=</i>
           Takes a boolean. Specifies if dynamic shuffling of flows is
           enabled. Applies only for balance-tlb mode. Defaults to
           unset.

           Added in version 240.

       <i>MinLinks=</i>
           Specifies the minimum number of links that must be active
           before asserting carrier. The default value is 0.

           Added in version 220.

       <i>ARPMissedMax=</i>
           Specify the maximum number of arp interval monitor cycle for
           missed ARP replies. If this number is exceeded, link is
           reported as down. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 256.

[XFRM] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [Xfrm] section accepts the following keys:

       <i>InterfaceId=</i>
           Sets the ID/key of the xfrm interface which needs to be
           associated with a SA/policy. Can be decimal or hexadecimal,
           valid range is 1-0xffffffff. This is mandatory.

           Added in version 243.

       <i>Independent=</i>
           Takes a boolean. If false (the default), the xfrm interface
           must have an underlying device which can be used for hardware
           offloading.

           Added in version 243.

       For more detail information see <b>Virtual XFRM Interfaces</b>[18].
</pre> <h2>
[VRF] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [VRF] section only applies for netdevs of kind "vrf" and
       accepts the following key:

       <i>Table=</i>
           The numeric routing table identifier. This setting is
           compulsory.

           Added in version 243.
</pre> <h2>
[BATMANADVANCED] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [BatmanAdvanced] section only applies for netdevs of kind
       "batadv" and accepts the following keys:

       <i>GatewayMode=</i>
           Takes one of "off", "server", or "client". A batman-adv node
           can either run in server mode (sharing its internet
           connection with the mesh) or in client mode (searching for
           the most suitable internet connection in the mesh) or having
           the gateway support turned off entirely (which is the default
           setting).

           Added in version 248.

       <i>Aggregation=</i>
           Takes a boolean value. Enables or disables aggregation of
           originator messages. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>BridgeLoopAvoidance=</i>
           Takes a boolean value. Enables or disables avoidance of loops
           on bridges. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>DistributedArpTable=</i>
           Takes a boolean value. Enables or disables the distributed
           ARP table. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>Fragmentation=</i>
           Takes a boolean value. Enables or disables fragmentation.
           Defaults to true.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>HopPenalty=</i>
           The hop penalty setting allows one to modify <b>batctl</b>(8)
           preference for multihop routes vs. short routes. This integer
           value is applied to the TQ (Transmit Quality) of each
           forwarded OGM (Originator Message), thereby propagating the
           cost of an extra hop (the packet has to be received and
           retransmitted which costs airtime). A higher hop penalty will
           make it more unlikely that other nodes will choose this node
           as intermediate hop towards any given destination. The
           default hop penalty of '15' is a reasonable value for most
           setups and probably does not need to be changed. However,
           mobile nodes could choose a value of 255 (maximum value) to
           avoid being chosen as a router by other nodes. The minimum
           value is 0.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>OriginatorIntervalSec=</i>
           The value specifies the interval in seconds, unless another
           time unit is specified in which batman-adv floods the network
           with its protocol information. See <a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)</a> for more
           information.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>GatewayBandwidthDown=</i>
           If the node is a server, this parameter is used to inform
           other nodes in the network about this node's internet
           connection download bandwidth in bits per second. Just enter
           any number suffixed with K, M, G or T (base 1000) and the
           batman-adv module will propagate the entered value in the
           mesh.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>GatewayBandwidthUp=</i>
           If the node is a server, this parameter is used to inform
           other nodes in the network about this node's internet
           connection upload bandwidth in bits per second. Just enter
           any number suffixed with K, M, G or T (base 1000) and the
           batman-adv module will propagate the entered value in the
           mesh.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>RoutingAlgorithm=</i>
           This can be either "batman-v" or "batman-iv" and describes
           which routing_algo of <b>batctl</b>(8) to use. The algorithm cannot
           be changed after interface creation. Defaults to "batman-v".

           Added in version 248.
</pre> <h2>
[IPOIB] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [IPoIB] section only applies for netdevs of kind "ipoib" and
       accepts the following keys:

       <i>PartitionKey=</i>
           Takes an integer in the range 1...0xffff, except for 0x8000.
           Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>Mode=</i>
           Takes one of the special values "datagram" or "connected".
           Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.

           When "datagram", the Infiniband unreliable datagram (UD)
           transport is used, and so the interface MTU is equal to the
           IB L2 MTU minus the IPoIB encapsulation header (4 bytes). For
           example, in a typical IB fabric with a 2K MTU, the IPoIB MTU
           will be 2048 - 4 = 2044 bytes.

           When "connected", the Infiniband reliable connected (RC)
           transport is used. Connected mode takes advantage of the
           connected nature of the IB transport and allows an MTU up to
           the maximal IP packet size of 64K, which reduces the number
           of IP packets needed for handling large UDP datagrams, TCP
           segments, etc and increases the performance for large
           messages.

           Added in version 250.

       <i>IgnoreUserspaceMulticastGroup=</i>
           Takes an boolean value. When true, the kernel ignores
           multicast groups handled by userspace. Defaults to unset, and
           the kernel's default is used.

           Added in version 250.
</pre> <h2>
[WLAN] SECTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The [WLAN] section only applies to WLAN interfaces, and accepts
       the following keys:

       <i>PhysicalDevice=</i>
           Specifies the name or index of the physical WLAN device (e.g.
           "0" or "phy0"). The list of the physical WLAN devices that
           exist on the host can be obtained by <b>iw phy </b>command. This
           option is mandatory.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>Type=</i>
           Specifies the type of the interface. Takes one of the
           "ad-hoc", "station", "ap", "ap-vlan", "wds", "monitor",
           "mesh-point", "p2p-client", "p2p-go", "p2p-device", "ocb",
           and "nan". This option is mandatory.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>WDS=</i>
           Enables the Wireless Distribution System (WDS) mode on the
           interface. The mode is also known as the "4 address mode".
           Takes a boolean value. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's
           default will be used.

           Added in version 251.
