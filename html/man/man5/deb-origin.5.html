NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-origin - Vendor-specific information files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/usr/local/etc/dpkg/origins/</b><i>filename</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The files in <b>/usr/local/etc/dpkg/origins </b>can provide information
       about various vendors who are providing Debian packages.

       They contain a number of fields, or comments when the line starts
       with ‘<b>#</b>’.  Each field begins with a tag, such as <b>Vendor </b>or
       <b>Parent</b>, followed by a colon and the body of the field.  Fields
       are delimited only by field tags.  In other words, field text may
       be multiple lines in length, but the tools will join lines when
       processing the body of the field.

       The file should be named according to the vendor name.  The usual
       convention is to name the vendor file using the vendor name in
       all lowercase, but some variation is permitted.

       Namely (since dpkg 1.21.10), first, non-alphanumeric characters
       (‘<b>[^A-Za-z0-9]</b>’) are mapped to dashes (‘<b>-</b>’), then the resulting
       name will be tried in sequence by lower-casing it, keeping it as
       is, lower-casing then capitalizing it (that is upper-casing the
       first character), and only capitalizing it.

       In addition, for historical and backwards compatibility, the name
       will be tried keeping it as is without non-alphanumeric
       characters remapping, then the resulting name will be tried in
       sequence by lower-casing it, keeping it as is, lower-casing then
       capitalizing it, and only capitalizing it.  And finally the name
       will be tried by remapping spaces to dashes (‘<b>-</b>’), then the
       resulting name will be tried in sequence by lower-casing it,
       keeping it as is, lower-casing then capitalizing it, and only
       capitalizing it.

       But these backwards compatible module lookups will be removed
       during the dpkg 1.22.x release cycle.
