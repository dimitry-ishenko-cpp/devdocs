DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>STORAGE LOCATION</b>
       Compiled terminfo descriptions are placed under the directory
       <b>@TERMINFO@</b>.  Two configurations are supported (when building the
       <b>ncurses </b>libraries):

       <b>directory tree</b>
            A two-level scheme is used to avoid a linear search of a
            huge UNIX system directory: <b>@TERMINFO@/c/name </b>where <i>name</i> is
            the name of the terminal, and <i>c</i> is the first character of
            <i>name</i>.  Thus, <i>act4</i> can be found in the file
            <b>@TERMINFO@/a/act4</b>.  Synonyms for the same terminal are
            implemented by multiple links to the same compiled file.

       <b>hashed database</b>
            Using Berkeley database, two types of records are stored:
            the terminfo data in the same format as stored in a
            directory tree with the terminfo's primary name as a key,
            and records containing only aliases pointing to the primary
            name.

            If built to write hashed databases, <b>ncurses </b>can still read
            terminfo databases organized as a directory tree, but cannot
            write entries into the directory tree.  It can write (or
            rewrite) entries in the hashed database.

            <b>ncurses </b>distinguishes the two cases in the TERMINFO and
            TERMINFO_DIRS environment variable by assuming a directory
            tree for entries that correspond to an existing directory,
            and hashed database otherwise.

   <b>LEGACY STORAGE FORMAT</b>
       The format has been chosen so that it will be the same on all
       hardware.  An 8 or more bit byte is assumed, but no assumptions
       about byte ordering or sign extension are made.

       The compiled file is created with the <b>@TIC@ </b>program, and read by
       the routine <b>setupterm</b>(3X).  The file is divided into six parts:

            a) <i>header</i>,

            b) <i>terminal names</i>,

            c) <i>boolean flags</i>,

            d) <i>numbers</i>,

            e) <i>strings</i>, and

            f) <i>string table</i>.

       The <i>header</i> section begins the file.  This section contains six
       short integers in the format described below.  These integers are

            (1) the <i>magic number</i> (octal 0432);

            (2) the size, in bytes, of the <i>terminal names</i> section;

            (3) the number of bytes in the <i>boolean flags</i> section;

            (4) the number of short integers in the <i>numbers</i> section;

            (5) the number of offsets (short integers) in the <i>strings</i>
            section;

            (6) the size, in bytes, of the <i>string table</i>.

       The capabilities in the <i>boolean flags</i>, <i>numbers</i>, and <i>strings</i>
       sections are in the same order as the file &lt;term.h&gt;.

       Short integers are signed, in the range -32768 to 32767.  They
       are stored as two 8-bit bytes.  The first byte contains the least
       significant 8 bits of the value, and the second byte contains the
       most significant 8 bits.  (Thus, the value represented is
       256*second+first.)  This format corresponds to the hardware of
       the VAX and PDP-11 (that is, little-endian machines).  Machines
       where this does not correspond to the hardware must read the
       integers as two bytes and compute the little-endian value.

       Numbers in a terminal description, whether they are entries in
       the <i>numbers</i> or <i>strings</i> table, are positive integers.  Boolean
       flags are treated as positive one-byte integers.  In each case,
       those positive integers represent a terminal capability.  The
       terminal compiler @TIC@ uses negative integers to handle the
       cases where a capability is not available:

       •   If a capability is absent from this terminal, @TIC@ stores a
           -1 in the corresponding table.

           The integer value -1 is represented by two bytes 0377, 0377.
           Absent boolean values are represented by the byte 0 (false).

       •   If a capability has been canceled from this terminal, @TIC@
           stores a -2 in the corresponding table.

           The integer value -2 is represented by two bytes 0377, 0376.
           The boolean value -2 is represented by the byte 0376.

       •   Other negative values are illegal.

       The <i>terminal names</i> section comes after the <i>header</i>.  It contains
       the first line of the terminfo description, listing the various
       names for the terminal, separated by the “|” character.  The
       <i>terminal names</i> section is terminated with an ASCII NUL character.

       The <i>boolean flags</i> section has one byte for each flag.  Boolean
       capabilities are either 1 or 0 (true or false) according to
       whether the terminal supports the given capability or not.

       Between the <i>boolean flags</i> section and the <i>number</i> section, a null
       byte will be inserted, if necessary, to ensure that the <i>number</i>
       section begins on an even byte This is a relic of the PDP-11's
       word-addressed architecture, originally designed to avoid traps
       induced by addressing a word on an odd byte boundary.  All short
       integers are aligned on a short word boundary.

       The <i>numbers</i> section is similar to the <i>boolean flags</i> section.
       Each capability takes up two bytes, and is stored as a little-
       endian short integer.

       The <i>strings</i> section is also similar.  Each capability is stored
       as a short integer.  The capability value is an index into the
       <i>string table</i>.

       The <i>string table</i> is the last section.  It contains all of the
       values of string capabilities referenced in the <i>strings</i> section.
       Each string is null-terminated.  Special characters in ^X or \c
       notation are stored in their interpreted form, not the printing
       representation.  Padding information $&lt;nn&gt; and parameter
       information %x are stored intact in uninterpreted form.

   <b>EXTENDED STORAGE FORMAT</b>
       The previous section describes the conventional terminfo binary
       format.  With some minor variations of the offsets (see
       PORTABILITY), the same binary format is used in all modern UNIX
       systems.  Each system uses a predefined set of boolean, number or
       string capabilities.

       The <b>ncurses </b>libraries and applications support extended terminfo
       binary format, allowing users to define capabilities which are
       loaded at runtime.  This extension is made possible by using the
       fact that the other implementations stop reading the terminfo
       data when they have reached the end of the size given in the
       header.  <b>ncurses </b>checks the size, and if it exceeds that due to
       the predefined data, continues to parse according to its own
       scheme.

       First, it reads the extended header (5 short integers):

            (1)  count of extended boolean capabilities

            (2)  count of extended numeric capabilities

            (3)  count of extended string capabilities

            (4)  count of the items in extended string table

            (5)  size of the extended string table in bytes

       The count- and size-values for the extended string table include
       the extended capability <i>names</i> as well as extended capability
       <i>values</i>.

       Using the counts and sizes, <b>ncurses </b>allocates arrays and reads
       data for the extended capabilities in the same order as the
       header information.

       The extended string table contains values for string
       capabilities.  After the end of these values, it contains the
       names for each of the extended capabilities in order, e.g.,
       booleans, then numbers and finally strings.

       Applications which manipulate terminal data can use the
       definitions described in <b>term_variables</b>(3X) which associate the
       long capability names with members of a <b>TERMTYPE </b>structure.

   <b>EXTENDED NUMBER FORMAT</b>
       On occasion, 16-bit signed integers are not large enough.  With
       <b>ncurses </b>6.1, a new format was introduced by making a few changes
       to the legacy format:

       •   a different magic number (octal 01036)

       •   changing the type for the <i>number</i> array from signed 16-bit
           integers to signed 32-bit integers.

       To maintain compatibility, the library presents the same data
       structures to direct users of the <b>TERMTYPE </b>structure as in
       previous formats.  However, that cannot provide callers with the
       extended numbers.  The library uses a similar but hidden data
       structure <b>TERMTYPE2 </b>to provide data for the terminfo functions.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
   <b>setupterm</b>
       Note that it is possible for <b>setupterm </b>to expect a different set
       of capabilities than are actually present in the file.  Either
       the database may have been updated since <b>setupterm </b>was recompiled
       (resulting in extra unrecognized entries in the file) or the
       program may have been recompiled more recently than the database
       was updated (resulting in missing entries).  The routine
       <b>setupterm </b>must be prepared for both possibilities - this is why
       the numbers and sizes are included.  Also, new capabilities must
       always be added at the end of the lists of boolean, number, and
       string capabilities.

   <b>Binary format</b>
       X/Open Curses does not specify a format for the terminfo
       database.  UNIX System V curses used a directory-tree of binary
       files, one per terminal description.

       Despite the consistent use of little-endian for numbers and the
       otherwise self-describing format, it is not wise to count on
       portability of binary terminfo entries between commercial UNIX
       versions.  The problem is that there are at least three versions
       of terminfo (under HP-UX, AIX, and OSF/1) which diverged from
       System V terminfo after SVr1, and have added extension
       capabilities to the string table that (in the binary format)
       collide with System V and XSI Curses extensions.  See <a href="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a>
       for detailed discussion of terminfo source compatibility issues.

       This implementation is by default compatible with the binary
       terminfo format used by Solaris curses, except in a few less-used
       details where it was found that the latter did not match X/Open
       Curses.  The format used by the other Unix versions can be
       matched by building ncurses with different configuration options.

   <b>Magic codes</b>
       The magic number in a binary terminfo file is the first 16-bits
       (two bytes).  Besides making it more reliable for the library to
       check that a file is terminfo, utilities such as <a href="../man1/file.1.html">file(1)</a> also use
       that to tell what the file-format is.  System V defined more than
       one magic number, with 0433, 0435 as screen-dumps (see
       <a href="scr_dump.5.html">scr_dump(5)</a>).  This implementation uses 01036 as a continuation
       of that sequence, but with a different high-order byte to avoid
       confusion.

   <b>The TERMTYPE structure</b>
       Direct access to the <b>TERMTYPE </b>structure is provided for legacy
       applications.  Portable applications should use the <b>tigetflag </b>and
       related functions described in <b>curs_terminfo</b>(3X) for reading
       terminal capabilities.

   <b>Mixed-case terminal names</b>
       A small number of terminal descriptions use uppercase characters
       in their names.  If the underlying filesystem ignores the
       difference between uppercase and lowercase, <b>ncurses </b>represents
       the “first character” of the terminal name used as the
       intermediate level of a directory tree in (two-character)
       hexadecimal form.

       As an example, here is a description for the Lear-Siegler ADM-3,
       a popular though rather stupid early terminal:

           adm3a|lsi adm3a,
                   am,
                   cols#80, lines#24,
                   bel=^G, clear= 32$&lt;1&gt;, cr=^M, cub1=^H, cud1=^J,
                   cuf1=^L, cup=\E=%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c, cuu1=^K,
                   home=^^, ind=^J,

       and a hexadecimal dump of the compiled terminal description:

</pre> <h2>
LIMITS </h2>
<pre>
       Some limitations:

       •   total compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes in the legacy
           format.

       •   total compiled entries cannot exceed 32768 bytes in the
           extended format.

       •   the name field cannot exceed 128 bytes.

       Compiled entries are limited to 32768 bytes because offsets into
       the <i>strings table</i> use two-byte integers.  The legacy format could
       have supported 32768-byte entries, but was limited a virtual
       memory page's 4096 bytes.
