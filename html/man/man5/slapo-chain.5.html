NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-chain - chain overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>chain </b>overlay to <a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> allows automatic referral chasing.
       Any time a referral is returned (except for bind operations), it
       is chased by using an instance of the ldap backend.  If
       operations are performed with an identity (i.e. after a bind),
       that identity can be asserted while chasing the referrals by
       means of the <i>identity assertion</i> feature of back-ldap (see
       <a href="slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap(5)</a> for details), which is essentially based on the
       <b>proxied authorization </b>control [RFC 4370].  Referral chasing can
       be controlled by the client by issuing the <b>chaining </b>control (see
       <i>draft-sermersheim-ldap-chaining</i> for details.)

       The config directives that are specific to the <b>chain </b>overlay are
       prefixed by <b>chain-</b>, to avoid potential conflicts with directives
       specific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.

       There are very few chain overlay specific directives; however,
       directives related to the instances of the <i>ldap</i> backend that may
       be implicitly instantiated by the overlay may assume a special
       meaning when used in conjunction with this overlay.  They are
       described in <a href="slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap(5)</a>, and they also need to be prefixed by
       <b>chain-</b>.

       Note: this overlay is built into the <i>ldap</i> backend; it is not a
       separate module.

       <b>overlay chain</b>
              This directive adds the chain overlay to the current
              backend.  The chain overlay may be used with any backend,
              but it is mainly intended for use with local storage
              backends that may return referrals.  It is useless in
              conjunction with the <i>slapd-ldap</i> and <i>slapd-meta</i> backends
              because they already exploit the libldap specific referral
              chase feature.  [Note: this may change in the future, as
              the <b>ldap</b>(5) and <b>meta</b>(5) backends might no longer chase
              referrals on their own.]

       <b>chain-cache-uri {FALSE|true}</b>
              This directive instructs the <i>chain</i> overlay to cache
              connections to URIs parsed out of referrals that are not
              predefined, to be reused for later chaining.  These URIs
              inherit the properties configured for the underlying
              <a href="slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap(5)</a> before any occurrence of the <b>chain-uri</b>
              directive; basically, they are chained anonymously.

       <b>chain-chaining [resolve=&lt;r&gt;] [continuation=&lt;c&gt;] [critical]</b>
              This directive enables the <i>chaining</i> control (see <i>draft-</i>
              <i>sermersheim-ldap-chaining</i> for details) with the desired
              resolve and continuation behaviors and criticality.  The
              <b>resolve </b>parameter refers to the behavior while discovering
              a resource, namely when accessing the object indicated by
              the request DN; the <b>continuation </b>parameter refers to the
              behavior while handling intermediate responses, which is
              mostly significant for the search operation, but may
              affect extended operations that return intermediate
              responses.  The values <b>r </b>and <b>c </b>can be any of
              <b>chainingPreferred</b>, <b>chainingRequired</b>, <b>referralsPreferred</b>,
              <b>referralsRequired</b>.  If the <b>critical </b>flag affects the
              control criticality if provided.  [This control is
              experimental and its support may change in the future.]

       <b>chain-max-depth &lt;n&gt;</b>
              In case a referral is returned during referral chasing,
              further chasing occurs at most <b>&lt;n&gt; </b>levels deep.  Set to <b>1</b>
              (the default) to disable further referral chasing.

       <b>chain-return-error {FALSE|true}</b>
              In case referral chasing fails, the real error is returned
              instead of the original referral.  In case multiple
              referral URIs are present, only the first error is
              returned.  This behavior may not be always appropriate nor
              desirable, since failures in referral chasing might be
              better resolved by the client (e.g. when caused by
              distributed authentication issues).

       <b>chain-uri &lt;ldapuri&gt;</b>
              This directive instantiates a new underlying <i>ldap</i> database
              and instructs it about which URI to contact to chase
              referrals.  As opposed to what stated in <a href="slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap(5)</a>,
              only one URI can appear after this directive; all
              subsequent <a href="slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap(5)</a> directives prefixed by <b>chain-</b>
              refer to this specific instance of a remote server.

       Directives for configuring the underlying ldap database may also
       be required, as shown in this example:

              overlay                 chain
              chain-rebind-as-user    FALSE

              chain-uri               "ldap://ldap1.example.com"
              chain-rebind-as-user    TRUE
              chain-idassert-bind     bindmethod="simple"
                                      binddn="cn=Auth,dc=example,dc=com"
                                      credentials="secret"
                                      mode="self"

              chain-uri               "ldap://ldap2.example.com"
              chain-idassert-bind     bindmethod="simple"
                                      binddn="cn=Auth,dc=example,dc=com"
                                      credentials="secret"
                                      mode="none"

       Any valid directives for the ldap database may be used; see
       <a href="slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap(5)</a> for details.  Multiple occurrences of the <b>chain-uri</b>
       directive may appear, to define multiple "trusted" URIs where
       operations with <i>identity assertion</i> are chained.  All URIs not
       listed in the configuration are chained anonymously.  All
       <a href="slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap(5)</a> directives appearing before the first occurrence of
       <b>chain-uri </b>are inherited by all URIs, unless specifically
       overridden inside each URI configuration.
