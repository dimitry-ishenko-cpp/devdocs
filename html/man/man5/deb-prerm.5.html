NAME </h2>
<pre>
       deb-prerm - package pre-removal maintainer script
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DEBIAN/prerm</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A package can perform several pre-removal actions via maintainer
       scripts, by including an executable <i>prerm</i> file in its control
       archive (i.e. <i>DEBIAN/prerm</i> during package creation).

       The script can be called in the following ways:

       <i>prerm</i> <b>remove</b>
           Before the package is removed.

       <i>old-prerm</i> <b>upgrade </b><i>new-version</i>
           Before an upgrade.

       <i>new-prerm</i> <b>failed-upgrade </b><i>old-version new-version</i>
           If the above <b>upgrade </b>fails.

           The <i>new-version</i> is passed only since dpkg 1.18.5.

       <i>prerm</i> <b>deconfigure in-favour </b><i>new-package new-version</i>
           [ <b>removing </b><i>old-package old-version</i> ]
           Before package is deconfigured while dependency is replaced
           due to conflict.

       <i>prerm</i> <b>remove in-favour </b><i>new-package new-version</i>
           Before the package is replaced due to conflict.
