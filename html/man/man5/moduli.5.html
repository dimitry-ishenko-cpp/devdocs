</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>moduli </b>— Diffie-Hellman moduli
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>/etc/moduli</i> file contains prime numbers and generators for
       use by <i>sshd</i>(8) in the Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange key exchange
       method.

       New moduli may be generated with <i>ssh-keygen</i>(1) using a two-step
       process.  An initial <i>candidate generation</i> pass, using <b>ssh-keygen</b>
       <b>-M generate</b>, calculates numbers that are likely to be useful.  A
       second <i>primality testing</i> pass, using <b>ssh-keygen -M screen</b>,
       provides a high degree of assurance that the numbers are prime
       and are safe for use in Diffie-Hellman operations by <i>sshd</i>(8).
       This <b>moduli </b>format is used as the output from each pass.

       The file consists of newline-separated records, one per modulus,
       containing seven space-separated fields.  These fields are as
       follows:

             timestamp    The time that the modulus was last processed
                          as YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.

             type         Decimal number specifying the internal
                          structure of the prime modulus.  Supported
                          types are:

                          0     Unknown, not tested.
                          2     "Safe" prime; (p-1)/2 is also prime.
                          4     Sophie Germain; 2p+1 is also prime.

                          Moduli candidates initially produced by
                          <i>ssh-keygen</i>(1) are Sophie Germain primes (type
                          4).  Further primality testing with
                          <i>ssh-keygen</i>(1) produces safe prime moduli (type
                          2) that are ready for use in <i>sshd</i>(8).  Other
                          types are not used by OpenSSH.

             tests        Decimal number indicating the type of
                          primality tests that the number has been
                          subjected to represented as a bitmask of the
                          following values:

                          0x00  Not tested.
                          0x01  Composite number – not prime.
                          0x02  Sieve of Eratosthenes.
                          0x04  Probabilistic Miller-Rabin primality
                                tests.

                          The <i>ssh-keygen</i>(1) moduli candidate generation
                          uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes (flag 0x02).
                          Subsequent <i>ssh-keygen</i>(1) primality tests are
                          Miller-Rabin tests (flag 0x04).

             trials       Decimal number indicating the number of
                          primality trials that have been performed on
                          the modulus.

             size         Decimal number indicating the size of the
                          prime in bits.

             generator    The recommended generator for use with this
                          modulus (hexadecimal).

             modulus      The modulus itself in hexadecimal.

       When performing Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange, <i>sshd</i>(8) first
       estimates the size of the modulus required to produce enough
       Diffie-Hellman output to sufficiently key the selected symmetric
       cipher.  <i>sshd</i>(8) then randomly selects a modulus from <i>/etc/moduli</i>
       that best meets the size requirement.
