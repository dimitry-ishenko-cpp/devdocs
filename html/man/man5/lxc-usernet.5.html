NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lxc-usernet - unprivileged user network administration file.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/lxc/lxc-usernet</i> controls the limits which the program <b>lxc-</b>
       <b>user-nic </b>places on network interfaces which an unprivileged user
       may create.

   <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       This file consists of multiple entries, one per line, of the
       form:

       <b>user type bridge number</b>

       or

       <b>@group type bridge number</b>

       Where

       <b>user   </b>is the username to whom this entry applies.

       <b>@group </b>is the groupname to which this entry applies.

       <b>type   </b>is the type of network interface being allowed. Only veth
              is currently supported.

       <b>bridge </b>is the bridge to which the network interfaces may be
              attached, for instance <i>lxcbr0</i>.

       <b>number </b>is the number or quota of network interfaces of the given
              type which the given user or group may attach to the given
              bridge, for instance <i>2</i>.

       Since a user can be specified both by username as well as one or
       more usergroups, it is possible that several configuration lines
       enable that user to create network interfaces. In such cases, any
       interfaces create are counted towards the quotas of the user or
       group in the order in which they appear in the file. If the quota
       of one line is full, the rest will be parsed until one is found
       or the end of the file.
