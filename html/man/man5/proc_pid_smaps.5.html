DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/smaps</i> (since Linux 2.6.14)
              This file shows memory consumption for each of the
              process's mappings.  (The <a href="../man1/pmap.1.html">pmap(1)</a> command displays similar
              information, in a form that may be easier for parsing.)
              For each mapping there is a series of lines such as the
              following:

                  00400000-0048a000 r-xp 00000000 fd:03 960637       /bin/bash
                  Size:                552 kB
                  Rss:                 460 kB
                  Pss:                 100 kB
                  Shared_Clean:        452 kB
                  Shared_Dirty:          0 kB
                  Private_Clean:         8 kB
                  Private_Dirty:         0 kB
                  Referenced:          460 kB
                  Anonymous:             0 kB
                  AnonHugePages:         0 kB
                  ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
                  ShmemPmdMapped:        0 kB
                  Swap:                  0 kB
                  KernelPageSize:        4 kB
                  MMUPageSize:           4 kB
                  Locked:                0 kB
                  ProtectionKey:         0
                  VmFlags: rd ex mr mw me dw

              The first of these lines shows the same information as is
              displayed for the mapping in <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/maps</i>.  The
              following lines show the size of the mapping, the amount
              of the mapping that is currently resident in RAM ("Rss"),
              the process's proportional share of this mapping ("Pss"),
              the number of clean and dirty shared pages in the mapping,
              and the number of clean and dirty private pages in the
              mapping.  "Referenced" indicates the amount of memory
              currently marked as referenced or accessed.  "Anonymous"
              shows the amount of memory that does not belong to any
              file.  "Swap" shows how much would-be-anonymous memory is
              also used, but out on swap.

              The "KernelPageSize" line (available since Linux 2.6.29)
              is the page size used by the kernel to back the virtual
              memory area.  This matches the size used by the MMU in the
              majority of cases.  However, one counter-example occurs on
              PPC64 kernels whereby a kernel using 64 kB as a base page
              size may still use 4 kB pages for the MMU on older
              processors.  To distinguish the two attributes, the
              "MMUPageSize" line (also available since Linux 2.6.29)
              reports the page size used by the MMU.

              The "Locked" indicates whether the mapping is locked in
              memory or not.

              The "ProtectionKey" line (available since Linux 4.9, on
              x86 only) contains the memory protection key (see
              <a href="../man7/pkeys.7.html">pkeys(7)</a>) associated with the virtual memory area.  This
              entry is present only if the kernel was built with the
              <b>CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MEMORY_PROTECTION_KEYS </b>configuration
              option (since Linux 4.6).

              The "VmFlags" line (available since Linux 3.8) represents
              the kernel flags associated with the virtual memory area,
              encoded using the following two-letter codes:

                     rd   -   readable
                     wr   -   writable

                     sr   -   sequential read advise provided
                     rr   -   random read advise provided
                     dc   -   do not copy area on fork
                     de   -   do not expand area on remapping
                     ac   -   area is accountable
                     nr   -   swap space is not reserved for the area
                     ht   -   area uses huge tlb pages
                     sf   -   perform synchronous page faults (since Linux 4.15)
                     nl   -   non-linear mapping (removed in Linux 4.0)
                     ar   -   architecture specific flag
                     wf   -   wipe on fork (since Linux 4.14)
                     dd   -   do not include area into core dump
                     sd   -   soft-dirty flag (since Linux 3.13)
                     mm   -   mixed map area
                     hg   -   huge page advise flag
                     nh   -   no-huge page advise flag
                     mg   -   mergeable advise flag
                     um   -   userfaultfd missing pages tracking (since Linux 4.3)
                     uw   -   userfaultfd wprotect pages tracking (since Linux 4.3)

              The <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/smaps</i> file is present only if the
              <b>CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR </b>kernel configuration option is
              enabled.
