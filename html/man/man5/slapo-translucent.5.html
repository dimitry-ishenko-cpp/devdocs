NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-translucent - Translucent Proxy overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Translucent Proxy overlay can be used with a backend database
       such as <a href="slapd-mdb.5.html">slapd-mdb(5)</a> to create a "translucent proxy".  Entries
       retrieved from a remote LDAP server may have some or all
       attributes overridden, or new attributes added, by entries in the
       local database before being presented to the client.

       A <b>search </b>operation is first populated with entries from the
       remote LDAP server, the attributes of which are then overridden
       with any attributes defined in the local database. Local
       overrides may be populated with the <b>add</b>, <b>modify , </b>and <b>modrdn</b>
       operations, the use of which is restricted to the root user.

       A <b>compare </b>operation will perform a comparison with attributes
       defined in the local database record (if any) before any
       comparison is made with data in the remote database.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The Translucent Proxy overlay uses a proxied database, typically
       a (set of) remote LDAP server(s), which is configured with the
       options shown in <a href="slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap(5)</a>, <a href="slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta(5)</a> or similar.  These
       <b>slapd.conf </b>options are specific to the Translucent Proxy overlay;
       they must appear after the <b>overlay </b>directive that instantiates
       the <b>translucent </b>overlay.

       <b>translucent_strict</b>
              By default, attempts to delete attributes in either the
              local or remote databases will be silently ignored. The
              <b>translucent_strict </b>directive causes these modifications to
              fail with a Constraint Violation.

       <b>translucent_no_glue</b>
              This configuration option disables the automatic creation
              of "glue" records for an <b>add </b>or <b>modrdn </b>operation, such
              that all parents of an entry added to the local database
              must be created by hand. Glue records are always created
              for a <b>modify </b>operation.

       <b>translucent_local &lt;attr[,attr...]&gt;</b>
              Specify a list of attributes that should be searched for
              in the local database when used in a search filter. By
              default, search filters are only handled by the remote
              database. With this directive, search filters will be
              split into a local and remote portion, and local
              attributes will be searched locally.

       <b>translucent_remote &lt;attr[,attr...]&gt;</b>
              Specify a list of attributes that should be searched for
              in the remote database when used in a search filter. This
              directive complements the <b>translucent_local </b>directive.
              Attributes may be specified as both local and remote if
              desired.

       If neither <b>translucent_local </b>nor <b>translucent_remote </b>are
       specified, the default behavior is to search the remote database
       with the complete search filter. If only <b>translucent_local </b>is
       specified, searches will only be run on the local database.
       Likewise, if only <b>translucent_remote </b>is specified, searches will
       only be run on the remote database. In any case, both the local
       and remote entries corresponding to a search result will be
       merged before being returned to the client.

       <b>translucent_bind_local</b>
              Enable looking for locally stored credentials for simple
              bind when binding to the remote database fails.  Disabled
              by default.

       <b>translucent_pwmod_local</b>
              Enable RFC 3062 Password Modification extended operation
              on locally stored credentials.  The operation only applies
              to entries that exist in the remote database.  Disabled by
              default.
</pre> <h2>
ACCESS CONTROL </h2>
<pre>
       Access control is delegated to either the remote DSA(s) or to the
       local database backend for <b>auth </b>and <b>write </b>operations.  It is
       delegated to the remote DSA(s) and to the frontend for <b>read</b>
       operations.  Local access rules involving data returned by the
       remote DSA(s) should be designed with care.  In fact, entries are
       returned by the remote DSA(s) only based on the remote fraction
       of the data, based on the identity the operation is performed as.
       As a consequence, local rules might only be allowed to see a
       portion of the remote data.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       The Translucent Proxy overlay will disable schema checking in the
       local database, so that an entry consisting of overlay attributes
       need not adhere to the complete schema.

       Because the translucent overlay does not perform any DN rewrites,
       the local and remote database instances must have the same
       suffix.  Other configurations will probably fail with No Such
       Object and other errors.
