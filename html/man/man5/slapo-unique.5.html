NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-unique - Attribute Uniqueness overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Attribute Uniqueness overlay can be used with a backend
       database such as <a href="slapd-mdb.5.html">slapd-mdb(5)</a> to enforce the uniqueness of some
       or all attributes within a scope. This subtree defaults to all
       objects within the subtree of the database for which the
       Uniqueness overlay is configured.

       Uniqueness is enforced by searching the subtree to ensure that
       the values of all attributes presented with an <b>add</b>, <b>modify </b>or
       <b>modrdn </b>operation are unique within the scope.  For example, if
       uniqueness were enforced for the <b>uid </b>attribute, the subtree would
       be searched for any other records which also have a <b>uid </b>attribute
       containing the same value. If any are found, the request is
       rejected.

       The search is performed using the rootdn of the database, to
       avoid issues with ACLs preventing the overlay from seeing all of
       the relevant data. As such, the database must have a rootdn
       configured.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf </b>options apply to the Attribute Uniqueness
       overlay.  They should appear after the <b>overlay </b>directive.

       <b>unique_uri &lt;[strict ][ignore ][serialize ]URI[[ URI...]...]&gt;</b>
              Configure the base, attributes, scope, and filter for
              uniqueness checking.  Multiple URIs may be specified
              within a domain, allowing complex selections of objects.
              Multiple <b>unique_uri </b>statements or <b>olcUniqueURI </b>attribute
              values will create independent domains, each with their
              own independent lists of URIs and ignore/strict settings.

              Keywords <b>strict</b>, <b>ignore</b>, and <b>serialize </b>have to be enclosed
              in quotes (") together with the URI when using deprecated
              slapd.conf configurations.

              The LDAP URI syntax is a subset of <b>RFC-4516, </b>and takes the
              form:

              ldap:///[base dn]?[attributes...]?scope[?filter]

              The <b>base dn </b>defaults to that of the back-end database.
              Specified base dns must be within the subtree of the back-
              end database.

              If no <b>attributes </b>are specified, the URI applies to all
              non-operational attributes.

              The <b>scope </b>component is effectively mandatory, because LDAP
              URIs default to <b>base </b>scope, which is not valid for
              uniqueness, because groups of one object are always
              unique.  Scopes of <b>sub </b>(for subtree) and <b>one </b>for one-level
              are valid.

              The <b>filter </b>component causes the domain to apply uniqueness
              constraints only to matching objects.  e.g.
              <b>ldap:///?cn?sub?(sn=e*) </b>would require unique <b>cn </b>attributes
              for all objects in the subtree of the back-end database
              whose <b>sn </b>starts with an e.

              It is possible to assert uniqueness upon all non-
              operational attributes except those listed by prepending
              the keyword <b>ignore </b>If not configured, all non-operational
              (e.g., system) attributes must be unique. Note that the
              <b>attributes </b>list of an <b>ignore </b>URI should generally contain
              the <b>objectClass</b>, <b>dc</b>, <b>ou </b>and <b>o </b>attributes, as these will
              generally not be unique, nor are they operational
              attributes.

              It is possible to set strict checking for the uniqueness
              domain by prepending the keyword <b>strict.  </b>By default,
              uniqueness is not enforced for null values. Enabling
              <b>strict </b>mode extends the concept of uniqueness to include
              null values, such that only one attribute within a subtree
              will be allowed to have a null value.  Strictness applies
              to all URIs within a uniqueness domain, but some domains
              may be strict while others are not.

              It is possible to enforce strict serialization of
              modifications by prepending the keyword <b>serialize.  </b>By
              default, no serialization is performed, so multiple
              modifications occurring nearly simultaneously may see
              incomplete uniqueness results.  Using <b>serialize </b>will force
              individual write operations to fully complete before
              allowing any others to proceed, to ensure that each
              operation's uniqueness checks are consistent.

       It is not possible to set both URIs and legacy slapo-unique
       configuration parameters simultaneously. In general, the legacy
       configuration options control pieces of a single unfiltered
       subtree domain.

       <b>unique_base &lt;basedn&gt;</b>
              This legacy configuration parameter should be converted to
              the <b>base dn </b>component of the above <b>unique_uri </b>style of
              parameter.

       <b>unique_ignore &lt;attribute...&gt;</b>
              This legacy configuration parameter should be converted to
              a <b>unique_uri </b>parameter with <b>ignore </b>keyword as described
              above.

       <b>unique_attributes &lt;attribute...&gt;</b>
              This legacy configuration parameter should be converted to
              a <b>unique_uri </b>parameter, as described above.

       <b>unique_strict &lt;attribute...&gt;</b>
              This legacy configuration parameter should be converted to
              a <b>strict </b>keyword prepended to a <b>unique_uri </b>parameter, as
              described above.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>unique_uri </b>cannot be used with the old-style of configuration,
       and vice versa.  <b>unique_uri </b>can implement everything the older
       system can do, however.

       Typical attributes for the <b>ignore ldap:///...  </b>URIs are
       intentionally not hardcoded into the overlay to allow for maximum
       flexibility in meeting site-specific requirements.

       Replication and operations with the <b>relax </b>control are allowed to
       bypass this enforcement. It is therefore important that all
       servers accepting writes have this overlay configured in order to
       maintain uniqueness in a replicated DIT.
