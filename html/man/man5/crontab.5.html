</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       crontab - files used to schedule the execution of programs
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A <i>crontab</i> file contains instructions for the <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> daemon in
       the following simplified manner: "run this command at this time
       on this date".  Each user can define their own crontab.  Commands
       defined in any given crontab are executed under the user who owns
       that particular crontab.  Uucp and News usually have their own
       crontabs, eliminating the need for explicitly running <a href="../man1/su.1.html">su(1)</a> as
       part of a cron command.

       Blank lines, leading spaces, and tabs are ignored.  Lines whose
       first non-white space character is a pound-sign (#) are comments,
       and are not processed.  Note that comments are not allowed on the
       same line as cron commands, since they are considered a part of
       the command.  Similarly, comments are not allowed on the same
       line as environment variable settings.

       An active line in a crontab is either an environment setting or a
       cron command.  An environment setting is of the form:

          name = value

       where the white spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional,
       and any subsequent non-leading white spaces in <i>value</i> is a part of
       the value assigned to <i>name</i>.  The <i>value</i> string may be placed in
       quotes (single or double, but matching) to preserve leading or
       trailing white spaces.

       Several environment variables are set up automatically by the
       <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> daemon.  <i>SHELL</i> is set to /bin/sh, and <i>LOGNAME</i> and <i>HOME</i>
       are set from the /etc/passwd line of the crontab´s owner.  <i>HOME</i>
       and <i>SHELL</i> can be overridden by settings in the crontab; LOGNAME
       can not.

       (Note: the <i>LOGNAME</i> variable is sometimes called <i>USER</i> on BSD
       systems and is also automatically set).

       In addition to <i>LOGNAME</i>, <i>HOME</i>, and <i>SHELL</i>, <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> looks at the
       <i>MAILTO</i> variable if a mail needs to be send as a result of running
       any commands in that particular crontab.  If <i>MAILTO</i> is defined
       (and non-empty), mail is sent to the specified address.  If
       <i>MAILTO</i> is defined but empty (<i>MAILTO=""</i>), no mail is sent.
       Otherwise, mail is sent to the owner of the crontab.  This option
       is useful if you decide to use /bin/mail instead of
       /usr/lib/sendmail as your mailer.  Note that /bin/mail does not
       provide aliasing and UUCP usually does not read its mail.  If
       <i>MAILFROM</i> is defined (and non-empty), it is used as the envelope
       sender address, otherwise, the username of the executing user is
       used. This variable is also inherited from the crond process
       environment.

       (Note: Both <i>MAILFROM</i> and <i>MAILTO</i> variables are expanded, so
       setting them as in the following example works as expected:
       MAILFROM=cron-$USER@cron.com ($USER is replaced by the system
       user) )

       By default, cron sends a mail using the 'Content-Type:' header of
       'text/plain' with the 'charset=' parameter set to the
       'charmap/codeset' of the locale in which <a href="../man8/crond.8.html">crond(8)</a> is started up,
       i.e., either the default system locale, if no LC_* environment
       variables are set, or the locale specified by the LC_*
       environment variables (see <a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale(7)</a>).  Different character
       encodings can be used for mailing cron job outputs by setting the
       <i>CONTENT_TYPE</i> and <i>CONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING</i> variables in a crontab
       to the correct values of the mail headers of those names.

       The <i>CRON_TZ</i> variable specifies the time zone specific for the
       cron table.  The user should enter a time according to the
       specified time zone into the table.  The time used for writing
       into a log file is taken from the local time zone, where the
       daemon is running.

       The <i>MLS_LEVEL</i> environment variable provides support for multiple
       per-job SELinux security contexts in the same crontab.  By
       default, cron jobs execute with the default SELinux security
       context of the user that created the crontab file.  When using
       multiple security levels and roles, this may not be sufficient,
       because the same user may be running in different roles or in
       different security levels.  For more information about roles and
       SELinux MLS/MCS, see <a href="../man8/selinux.8.html">selinux(8)</a> and the crontab example mentioned
       later on in this text.  You can set the <i>MLS_LEVEL</i> variable to the
       SELinux security context string specifying the particular SELinux
       security context in which you want jobs to be run.  <b>crond </b>will
       then set the execution context of those jobs that meet the
       specifications of the particular security context.  For more
       information, see <a href="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab(1)</a> -s option.

       The <i>RANDOM_DELAY</i> variable allows delaying job startups by random
       amount of minutes with upper limit specified by the variable. The
       random scaling factor is determined during the cron daemon
       startup so it remains constant for the whole run time of the
       daemon.

       The format of a cron command is similar to the V7 standard, with
       a number of upward-compatible extensions.  Each line has five
       time-and-date fields followed by a <b>user</b>name (if this is the
       <b>system </b>crontab file), and followed by a command.  Commands are
       executed by <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> when the 'minute', 'hour', and 'month of the
       year' fields match the current time, <i>and</i> at least one of the two
       'day' fields ('day of month', or 'day of week') match the current
       time (see "Note" below).

       Note that this means that non-existent times, such as the
       "missing hours" during the daylight savings time conversion, will
       never match, causing jobs scheduled during the "missing times"
       not to be run.  Similarly, times that occur more than once
       (again, during the daylight savings time conversion) will cause
       matching jobs to be run twice.

       <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> examines cron entries every minute.

       The time and date fields are:

              field          allowed values
              -----          --------------
              minute         0-59
              hour           0-23
              day of month   1-31
              month          1-12 (or names, see below)
              day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sunday, or use names)

       A field may contain an asterisk (*), which always stands for
       "first-last".

       Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated
       with a hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.  For example,
       8-11 for an 'hours' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10,
       and 11. The first number must be less than or equal to the second
       one.

       Randomization of the execution time within a range can be used.
       A random number within a range specified as two numbers separated
       with a tilde is picked.  The specified range is inclusive.  For
       example, 6~15 for a 'minutes' entry picks a random minute within
       6 to 15 range.  The random number is picked when crontab file is
       parsed.  The first number must be less than or equal to the
       second one. You might omit one or both of the numbers specifying
       the range.  For example, ~ for a 'minutes' entry picks a random
       minute within 0 to 59 range.

       Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges)
       separated by commas.  Examples: "1,2,5,9", "0-4,8-12".

       Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following a
       range with "/&lt;number&gt;" specifies skips of the number's value
       through the range.  For example, "0-23/2" can be used in the
       'hours' field to specify command execution for every other hour
       (the alternative in the V7 standard is "0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,
       20,22").  Step values are also permitted after an asterisk, so if
       specifying a job to be run every two hours, you can use "*/2".
       Please note that steps are evaluated just within the field they
       are applied to. For example "*/23" in hours field means to
       execute the job on the hour 0 and the hour 23 within a calendar
       day. See "NOTES" below for a workaround.

       Names can also be used for the 'month' and 'day of week' fields.
       Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case
       does not matter).  Ranges and lists of names are allowed.
       Examples: "mon,wed,fri", "jan-mar".

       If the UID of the owner is 0 (root), the first character of a
       crontab entry can be "-" character. This will prevent cron from
       writing a syslog message about the command being executed.

       The "sixth" field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to
       be run.  The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline
       or a "%" character, will be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell
       specified in the SHELL variable of the cronfile.  A "%" character
       in the command, unless escaped with a backslash (\), will be
       changed into newline characters, and all data after the first %
       will be sent to the command as standard input.

       Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified in the
       following two fields — 'day of month', and 'day of week'.  If
       both fields are restricted (i.e., do not contain the "*"
       character), the command will be run when <i>either</i> field matches the
       current time.  For example,
       "30 4 1,15 * 5" would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the
       1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday.

       A crontab file syntax can be tested before an install using the
       -T option. See <a href="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab(1)</a> for details.

       23 0-23/2 * * * echo "run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday"
       5 4 * * sun     echo "run at 5 after 4 every sunday"
</pre> <h2>
Jobs in /etc/cron.d/ </h2>
<pre>
       The jobs in <i>cron.d</i> and <i>/etc/crontab</i> are system jobs, which are
       used usually for more than one user, thus, additionally the
       username is needed.  MAILTO on the first line is optional.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE OF A JOB IN /etc/cron.d/job </h2>
<pre>
       #login as root
       #create job with preferred editor (e.g. vim)
       MAILTO=root
       * * * * * root touch /tmp/file
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       As noted above, skip values only operate within the time period
       they´re attached to. For example, specifying "0/35" for the
       minute field of a crontab entry won´t cause that entry to be
       executed every 35 minutes; instead, it will be executed twice
       every hour, at 0 and 35 minutes past.  For more fine-grained
       control you can do something like this:
       * * * * * if [ $(expr \( $(date +%s) / 60 \) % 58) = 0 ]; then echo this runs every 58 minutes; fi
       0 * * * * if [ $(expr \( $(date +%s) / 3600 \) % 23) = 0 ]; then echo this runs every 23 hours on the hour; fi
       Adjust as needed if your <a href="../man1/date.1.html">date(1)</a> command does not accept "+%s" as
       the format string specifier to output the current UNIX timestamp.
</pre> <h2>
SELinux with multi level security (MLS) </h2>
<pre>
       In a crontab, it is important to specify a security level by
       <i>crontab -s</i> or specifying the required level on the first line of
       the crontab.  Each level is specified in
       <i>/etc/selinux/targeted/seusers</i>.  When using crontab in the MLS
       mode, it is especially important to:
       - check/change the actual role,
       - set correct <i>role for directory</i>, which is used for input/output.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE FOR SELINUX MLS </h2>
<pre>
       # login as root
       newrole -r sysadm_r
       mkdir /tmp/SystemHigh
       chcon -l SystemHigh /tmp/SystemHigh
       crontab -e
       # write in crontab file
       MLS_LEVEL=SystemHigh
       0-59 * * * * id -Z &gt; /tmp/SystemHigh/crontest
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/crontab</i> main system crontab file.  <i>/var/spool/cron/</i> a
       directory for storing crontabs defined by users.  <i>/etc/cron.d/</i> a
       directory for storing system crontabs.

EXTENSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       These special time specification "nicknames" which replace the 5
       initial time and date fields, and are prefixed with the '@'
       character, are supported:

       @reboot    :    Run once after reboot.
       @yearly    :    Run once a year, ie.  "0 0 1 1 *".
       @annually  :    Run once a year, ie.  "0 0 1 1 *".
       @monthly   :    Run once a month, ie. "0 0 1 * *".
       @weekly    :    Run once a week, ie.  "0 0 * * 0".
       @daily     :    Run once a day, ie.   "0 0 * * *".
       @hourly    :    Run once an hour, ie. "0 * * * *".
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>crontab </b>files have to be regular files or symlinks to regular
       files, they must not be executable or writable for anyone else
       but the owner.  This requirement can be overridden by using the
       <b>-p </b>option on the crond command line.  If inotify support is in
       use, changes in the symlinked crontabs are not automatically
       noticed by the cron daemon.  The cron daemon must receive a
       SIGHUP signal to reload the crontabs.  This is a limitation of
       the inotify API.

       cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline
       character.  If the last entry in a crontab is missing a newline
       (i.e. terminated by EOF), cron will consider the crontab (at
       least partially) broken.  A warning will be written to syslog.
