NAME </h2>

       /proc/pid/mounts - mounted filesystems
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mounts</i> (since Linux 2.4.19)
              This file lists all the filesystems currently mounted in
              the process's mount namespace (see <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>).
              The format of this file is documented in <a href="fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a>.

              Since Linux 2.6.15, this file is pollable: after opening
              the file for reading, a change in this file (i.e., a
              filesystem mount or unmount) causes <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a> to mark the
              file descriptor as having an exceptional condition, and
              <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a> mark the file as having a
              priority event (<b>POLLPRI</b>).  (Before Linux 2.6.30, a change
              in this file was indicated by the file descriptor being
              marked as readable for <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>, and being marked as
              having an error condition for <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a>.)

       <i>/proc/mounts</i>
              Before Linux 2.4.19, this file was a list of all the
              filesystems currently mounted on the system.  With the
              introduction of per-process mount namespaces in Linux
              2.4.19 (see <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>), this file became a link
              to <i>/proc/self/mounts</i>, which lists the mounts of the
              process's own mount namespace.  The format of this file is
              documented in <a href="fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a>.
