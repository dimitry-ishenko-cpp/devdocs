       timesyncd.conf, timesyncd.conf.d - Network Time Synchronization
       configuration files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
           /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
           /run/systemd/timesyncd.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/timesyncd.conf

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These configuration files control NTP network time
       synchronization. See <a href="../man7/systemd.syntax.7.html">systemd.syntax(7)</a> for a general description
       of the syntax.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE </h2>
<pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so
       configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from
       those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of
       the listed directories in order of priority, only the first file
       found is used: /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], /usr/lib/systemd/. The vendor
       version of the file contains commented out entries showing the
       defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can
       also be created by creating drop-ins, as described below. The
       main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose (or a
       copy in /etc/ if it's shipped under /usr/), however using
       drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over
       modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration
       snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/.
       Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main
       configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic
       order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside.
       When multiple files specify the same option, for options which
       accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last
       takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values,
       entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can
       install drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
       local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
       configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have
       to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to
       prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit
       number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a
       concept of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship
       drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range used by
       users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding
       accidentally drop-ins defined by users. It is recommended to use
       the range 10-40 for drop-ins in /usr/ and the range 60-90 for
       drop-ins in /etc/ and /run/, to make sure that local and
       transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by the OS
       vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the
       recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the
       configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the
       vendor configuration file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following settings are configured in the [Time] section:

       <i>NTP=</i>
           A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP
           addresses. During runtime this list is combined with any
           per-interface NTP servers acquired from
           <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a>.  <b>systemd-timesyncd </b>will contact
           all configured system or per-interface servers in turn, until
           one responds. When the empty string is assigned, the list of
           NTP servers is reset, and all prior assignments will have no
           effect. This setting defaults to an empty list.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>FallbackNTP=</i>
           A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP
           addresses to be used as the fallback NTP servers. Any
           per-interface NTP servers obtained from
           <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a> take precedence over this
           setting, as do any servers set via <i>NTP=</i> above. This setting
           is hence only relevant if no other NTP server information is
           known. When the empty string is assigned, the list of NTP
           servers is reset, and all prior assignments will have no
           effect. If this option is not given, a compiled-in list of
           NTP servers is used.

           Added in version 216.

       <i>RootDistanceMaxSec=</i>
           Maximum acceptable root distance, i.e. the maximum estimated
           time required for a packet to travel to the server we are
           connected to from the server with the reference clock. If the
           current server does not satisfy this limit, <b>systemd-timesyncd</b>
           will switch to a different server.

           Takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds, but
           other units may be specified, see <b>systemd.time</b>(5). Defaults
           to 5 seconds.

           Added in version 236.

       <i>PollIntervalMinSec=</i>, <i>PollIntervalMaxSec=</i>
           The minimum and maximum poll intervals for NTP messages.
           Polling starts at the minimum poll interval, and is adjusted
           within the specified limits in response to received packets.

           Each setting takes a time span value. The default unit is
           seconds, but other units may be specified, see
           <b>systemd.time</b>(5).  <i>PollIntervalMinSec=</i> defaults to 32 seconds
           and must not be smaller than 16 seconds.  <i>PollIntervalMaxSec=</i>
           defaults to 34 min 8 s (2048 seconds) and must be larger than
           <i>PollIntervalMinSec=</i>.

           Added in version 236.

       <i>ConnectionRetrySec=</i>
           Specifies the minimum delay before subsequent attempts to
           contact a new NTP server are made.

           Takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds, but
           other units may be specified, see <b>systemd.time</b>(5). Defaults
           to 30 seconds and must not be smaller than 1 second.

           Added in version 248.

       <i>SaveIntervalSec=</i>
           The interval at which the current time is periodically saved
           to disk, in the absence of any recent synchronisation from an
           NTP server. This is especially useful for offline systems
           with no local RTC, as it will guarantee that the system clock
           remains roughly monotonic across reboots.

           Takes a time interval value. The default unit is seconds, but
           other units may be specified, see <b>systemd.time</b>(5). Defaults
           to 60 seconds.

           Added in version 250.

           be available at all times. If /usr/local/ is a separate
           partition, it may not be available during early boot, and
           must not be used for configuration.
