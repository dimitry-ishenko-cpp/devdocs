NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>aliases </b>— aliases file for smtpd
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page describes the format of the <b>aliases </b>file, as
       used by <i>smtpd</i>(8).  An alias, in its simplest form, is used to
       assign an arbitrary name to an email address or a group of email
       addresses.  This provides a convenient way to send mail.  For
       example an alias could refer to all users of a group: email to
       that alias would be sent to all members of the group.  Much more
       complex aliases can be defined however: an alias can refer to
       other aliases, be used to send mail to a file instead of another
       person, or to execute various commands.

       Within the file, ‘#’ is a comment delimiter; anything placed
       after it is discarded.  The file consists of key/value mappings
       of the form:

             key: value1, value2, value3, ...

       <i>key</i> is always folded to lowercase before alias lookups to ensure
       that there can be no ambiguity.  The key is expanded to the
       corresponding values, which consist of one or more of the
       following:

       <i>user</i>    A user on the host machine.  The user must have a valid
               entry in the <i>passwd</i>(5) database file.

       <i>/path/to/file</i>
               Append messages to <i>file</i>, specified by its absolute
               pathname.

       |<i>command</i>
               Pipe the message to <i>command</i> on its standard input.  The
               command is run under the privileges of the daemon's
               unprivileged account.

       :<i>include</i>:<i>/path/to/file</i>
               Include any definitions in <i>file</i> as alias entries.  The
               format of the file is identical to this one.

       <i>user-part@domain-part</i>
               An email address in RFC 5322 format.  If an address
               extension is appended to the user-part, it is first
               compared for an exact match.  It is then stripped so that
               an address such as user+ext@example.com will only use the
               part that precedes ‘+’ as a <i>key</i>.

       <i>error</i>:<i>code message</i>
               A status code and message to return.  The code must be 3
               digits, starting 4XX (TempFail) or 5XX (PermFail).  The
               message must be present and can be freely chosen.
