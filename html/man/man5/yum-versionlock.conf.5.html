</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="yum-versionlock.conf.5.html">yum-versionlock.conf(5)</a> is the configuration file for
       <a href="../man1/yum-versionlock.1.html">yum-versionlock(1)</a> Yum plugin for excluding packages that aren't
       listed in the versionlock file.  The plugin will walk each line
       of the versionlock file, parse out the name and version of the
       package. It will then exclude any package by that name that
       doesn't match one of the versions listed within the file (or,
       optionally, any obsoleter of that package).  This is basically
       the same as doing an exclude for the package name itself (as you
       cannot exclude installed packages), but yum will still see the
       versions you have installed/versionlocked as available so that
       "yum reinstall" will still work, etc.  It can also work in the
       opposite way, like a fast exclude, by prefixing a '!'  character
       to the version.

       <a href="yum-versionlock.conf.5.html">yum-versionlock.conf(5)</a> utilizes configuration options in the
       form of

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       follow_obsoletes
              This option is a boolean flag which specifies if the
              versionlock plugin should look at all the obsoletes, and
              see if any of the packages specified have an obsoleter. If
              an obsoleter is found then all versions of that package
              will be excluded. This option is off by default, as
              <a href="../man1/yum-versionlock.1.html">yum-versionlock(1)</a> will take some time to do the obsoletes
              processing, and for non-rename obsoletes any issues you
              had which kept you at a specific version of a package
              should be different with another package.

       locklist
              This option is a string with points to the file which will
              have the versionlock information in it. Note that the file
              <b>has </b>to exist (or the versionlock plugin will make yum
              exit). However it can be empty.

       show_hint
              This option is a boolean flag which specifies if the
              versionlock plugin should print a hint message whenever
              yum runs saying how many package updates available from
              the repos are being blocked due to versionlocks.  This
              hint serves as a reminder that there are locks in effect
              and that you may want to reconsider them since newer
              versions of those packages have been released.  Default is
              1 (show the hint).
