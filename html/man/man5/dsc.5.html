NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dsc - Debian source package control file format
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>filename</i><b>.dsc</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Each Debian source package is composed of a .dsc control file,
       which contains a number of fields, in <a href="deb822.5.html">deb822(5)</a> format.

       Each field begins with a tag, such as <b>Source </b>or <b>Binary </b>(case
       insensitive), followed by a colon, and the body of the field
       (case sensitive unless stated otherwise).  Fields are delimited
       only by field tags.  In other words, field text may be multiple
       lines in length, but the installation tools will generally join
       lines when processing the body of the field (except in case of
       the multiline fields <b>Package-List</b>, <b>Files</b>, <b>Checksums-Sha1 </b>and
       <b>Checksums-Sha256</b>, see below).

       The control data might be enclosed in an OpenPGP ASCII Armored
       signature, as specified in RFC4880.
</pre> <h2>
FIELDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Format: </b><i>format-version</i> (required)
           The value of this field declares the format version of the
           source package.  The field value is used by programs acting
           on a source package to interpret the list of files in the
           source package and determine how to unpack it.  The syntax of
           the field value is a numeric major revision (“0-9”), a period
           (“.”), a numeric minor revision (“0-9”), and then an optional
           subtype after whitespace (“ \t”), which if specified is a
           lowercase alphanumeric (“a-z0-9”) word in parentheses (“()”).
           The subtype is optional in the syntax but may be mandatory
           for particular source format revisions.

           The source formats currently supported by <b>dpkg </b>are <b>1.0</b>, <b>2.0</b>,
           <b>3.0 (native)</b>, <b>3.0 (quilt)</b>, <b>3.0 (git)</b>, <b>3.0 (bzr) </b>and <b>3.0</b>
           <b>(custom)</b>.  See <a href="../man1/dpkg-source.1.html">dpkg-source(1)</a> for their description.

       <b>Source: </b><i>source-name</i> (required)
           The value of this field determines the package name, and is
           used to generate file names by most installation tools.

       <b>Binary: </b><i>binary-package-list</i>
           This folded field lists binary packages which this source
           package can produce, separated by commas.

           This field has now been superseded by the <b>Package-List </b>field,
           which gives enough information about what binary packages are
           produced on which architecture, build-profile and other
           involved restrictions.

       <b>Architecture: </b><i>arch-list</i> (recommended)
           A list of architectures and architecture wildcards separated
           by spaces which specify the type of hardware this package can
           be compiled for.  Common architecture names and architecture
           wildcards are <b>amd64</b>, <b>armel</b>, <b>i386</b>, <b>linux-any</b>, <b>any-amd64</b>, etc.

           Note that the <b>all </b>value is meant for packages that are
           architecture independent, and <b>any </b>for packages that are
           architecture dependent.  The list may include (or consist
           solely of) the special value <b>all</b>.  When the list contains the
           architecture wildcard <b>any</b>, the only other value allowed in
           the list is <b>all</b>.

           The field value is generally generated from <b>Architecture</b>
           fields from in the <i>debian/control</i> in the source package.

       <b>Version: </b><i>version-string</i> (required)
           Typically, this is the original package's version number in
           whatever form the program's author uses.  It may also include
           a Debian revision number (for non-native packages).  The
           exact format and sorting algorithm are described in
           <a href="../man7/deb-version.7.html">deb-version(7)</a>.

       <b>Origin: </b><i>name</i>
           The name of the distribution this package is originating
           from.

       <b>Maintainer: </b><i>fullname-email</i> (recommended)
           Should be in the format “Joe Bloggs &lt;jbloggs@foo.com&gt;”, and
           is typically the person who created the package, as opposed
           to the author of the software that was packaged.

       <b>Uploaders: </b><i>fullname-email-list</i>
           Lists all the names and email addresses of co-maintainers of
           the package, in the same format as the <b>Maintainer </b>field.
           Multiple co-maintainers should be separated by a comma.

       <b>Description </b><i>short-description</i>
        <i>long-description</i>
           The format for the source package description is a short
           brief summary on the first line (after the <b>Description</b>
           field).  The following lines should be used as a longer, more
           detailed description.  Each line of the long description must
           be preceded by a space, and blank lines in the long
           description must contain a single ‘<b>.</b>’ following the preceding
           space.

       <b>Homepage: </b><i>url</i>
           The upstream project home page <i>url</i>.

       <b>Standards-Version: </b><i>version-string</i> (recommended)
           This documents the most recent version of the distribution
           policy standards this package complies with.

       <b>Vcs-Browser: </b><i>url</i>
           The <i>url</i> of a web interface to browse the Version Control
           System repository.

       <b>Vcs-Arch: </b><i>url</i>
       <b>Vcs-Bzr: </b><i>url</i>
       <b>Vcs-Cvs: </b><i>url</i>
       <b>Vcs-Darcs: </b><i>url</i>
       <b>Vcs-Git: </b><i>url</i>
       <b>Vcs-Hg: </b><i>url</i>
       <b>Vcs-Mtn: </b><i>url</i>
       <b>Vcs-Svn: </b><i>url</i>
           These fields declare the <i>url</i> of the Version Control System
           repository used to maintain this package.  See
           <a href="deb-src-control.5.html">deb-src-control(5)</a> for more details.

       <b>Testsuite: </b><i>name-list</i>
           This field declares that the source package contains the
           specified test suites.  The value is a comma-separated list
           of test suites.  If the <b>autopkgtest </b>value is present, a
           <i>debian/tests/control</i> is expected to be present, if the file
           is present but not the value, then <b>dpkg-source </b>will
           automatically add it, preserving previous values.

       <b>Testsuite-Triggers: </b><i>package-list</i>
           This field declares the comma-separated union of all test
           dependencies (<b>Depends </b>fields in <i>debian/tests/control</i> file),
           with all restrictions removed, and OR dependencies flattened
           (that is, converted to separate AND relationships), except
           for binaries generated by this source package and its meta-
           dependency equivalent <b>@</b>.

           <b>Rationale</b>: this field is needed because otherwise to be able
           to get the test dependencies, each source package would need
           to be unpacked.

       <b>Build-Depends: </b><i>package-list</i>
       <b>Build-Depends-Arch: </b><i>package-list</i>
       <b>Build-Depends-Indep: </b><i>package-list</i>
       <b>Build-Conflicts: </b><i>package-list</i>
       <b>Build-Conflicts-Arch: </b><i>package-list</i>
       <b>Build-Conflicts-Indep: </b><i>package-list</i>
           These fields declare relationships between the source package
           and packages used to build it.  They are discussed in the
           <a href="deb-src-control.5.html">deb-src-control(5)</a> manual page.

       <b>Package-List:</b>
        <i>package package-type section priority key-value-list</i>
           This multiline field contains a list of binary packages
           generated by this source package.

           The <i>package</i> is the binary package name.

           The <i>package-type</i> is the binary package type, usually <b>deb</b>,
           another common value is <b>udeb</b>.

           The <i>section</i> and <i>priority</i> match the binary package fields of
           the same name.

           The <i>key-value-list</i> is a space separated <i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> list, and
           the currently known optional keys are:

           <b>arch</b>
               The architecture restriction from the binary package
               <b>Architecture </b>field, with spaces converted to ‘,’.

           <b>profile</b>
               The normalized build-profile restriction formula from the
               binary package <b>Build-Profile </b>field, with ORs converted to
               ‘+’ and ANDs to ‘,’.

           <b>protected</b>
               If the binary package is protected, this key will contain
               the value of the <b>Protected </b>field, that is a <b>yes </b>value.

               Supported since dpkg 1.20.1.

           <b>essential</b>
               If the binary package is essential, this key will contain
               the value of the <b>Essential </b>field, that is a <b>yes </b>value.

       <b>Files: </b>(required, weak)
       <b>Checksums-Sha1: </b>(required, weak)
       <b>Checksums-Sha256: </b>(required, strong)
        <i>checksum size filename</i>
           These multiline fields contain a list of files with a
           checksum and size for each one.  These fields have the same
           syntax and differ only in the checksum algorithm used: MD5
           for <b>Files</b>, SHA-1 for <b>Checksums-Sha1 </b>and SHA-256 for
           <b>Checksums-Sha256</b>.

           The first line of the field value (the part on the same line
           as the field name followed by a colon) is always empty.  The
           content of the field is expressed as continuation lines, one
           line per file.  Each line consists of the checksum, a space,
           the file size, a space, and the file name.

           These fields list all files that make up the source package.
           The list of files in these fields must match the list of
           files in the other related fields.

           <b>Note</b>: The MD5 and SHA-1 checksums are considered weak, and
           should never be assumed to be sufficient for secure
           verification.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>Format </b>field conflates the format for the <b>.dsc </b>file itself
       and the format of the extracted source package.
