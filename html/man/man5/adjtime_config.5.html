</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       adjtime_config - information about hardware clock setting and
       drift factor
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/etc/adjtime</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The file <i>/etc/adjtime</i> contains descriptive information about the
       hardware mode clock setting and clock drift factor. The file is
       read and write by <a href="../man8/hwclock.8.html">hwclock(8)</a>; and read by programs like rtcwake
       to get RTC time mode.

       The file is usually located in <i>/etc</i>, but tools like <a href="../man8/hwclock.8.html">hwclock(8)</a> or
       <a href="../man8/rtcwake.8.html">rtcwake(8)</a> can use alternative location by command line options
       if write access to <i>/etc</i> is unwanted. The default clock mode is
       "UTC" if the file is missing.

       The Hardware Clock is usually not very accurate. However, much of
       its inaccuracy is completely predictable - it gains or loses the
       same amount of time every day. This is called systematic drift.
       The util <a href="../man8/hwclock.8.html">hwclock(8)</a> keeps the file <i>/etc/adjtime</i>, that keeps some
       historical information. For more details see "<b>The Adjust</b>
       <b>Function</b>" and "<b>The Adjtime File</b>" sections from <a href="../man8/hwclock.8.html">hwclock(8)</a> man
       page.

       The <i>adjtime</i> file is formatted in ASCII.

   <b>First line</b>
       Three numbers, separated by blanks:

       <b>drift factor</b>
           the systematic drift rate in seconds per day (floating point
           decimal)

       <b>last adjust time</b>
           the resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC of most recent
           adjustment or calibration (decimal integer)

       <b>adjustment status</b>
           zero (for compatibility with <b>clock</b>(8)) as a floating point
           decimal

   <b>Second line</b>
       <b>last calibration time</b>
           The resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC of most recent
           calibration. Zero if there has been no calibration yet or it
           is known that any previous calibration is moot (for example,
           because the Hardware Clock has been found, since that
           calibration, not to contain a valid time). This is a decimal
           integer.

   <b>Third line</b>
       <b>clock mode</b>
           Supported values are <b>UTC </b>or <b>LOCAL</b>. Tells whether the Hardware
           Clock is set to Coordinated Universal Time or local time. You
           can always override this value with options on the <a href="../man8/hwclock.8.html">hwclock(8)</a>
           command line.
