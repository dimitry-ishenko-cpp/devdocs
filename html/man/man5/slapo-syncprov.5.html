NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slapo-syncprov - Sync Provider overlay to slapd
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Sync Provider overlay implements the provider-side support
       for the LDAP Content Synchronization (RFC4533) as well as
       syncrepl replication support.  The overlay can be used with any
       backend that maintains entryCSN and entryUUID attributes for its
       entries. It also creates a contextCSN attribute in the root entry
       of the database.

       The contextCSN is updated for every write operation performed
       against the database. To reduce database contention, the
       contextCSN is only updated in memory. The value is written to the
       database on server shutdown and read into memory on startup, and
       maintained in memory thereafter. Checkpoints may be configured to
       write the contextCSN into the underlying database to minimize
       recovery time after an unclean shutdown.

       On databases that support inequality indexing, it is highly
       recommended to set an eq index on the entryCSN attribute when
       using this overlay.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf </b>options apply to the Sync Provider overlay.
       They should appear after the <b>overlay </b>directive.

       <b>syncprov-checkpoint &lt;ops&gt; &lt;minutes&gt;</b>
              After a write operation has succeeded, write the
              contextCSN to the underlying database if <b>&lt;ops&gt; </b>write
              operations or more than <b>&lt;minutes&gt; </b>time have passed since
              the last checkpoint. Checkpointing is disabled by default.

       <b>syncprov-sessionlog &lt;ops&gt;</b>
              Configures an in-memory session log for recording
              information about write operations made on the database.
              The <b>&lt;ops&gt; </b>specifies the number of operations that are
              recorded in the log. All write operations (except Adds)
              are recorded in the log.  When using the session log, it
              is helpful to set an eq index on the entryUUID attribute
              in the underlying database.

       <b>syncprov-sessionlog-source &lt;dn&gt;</b>
              Should not be set when syncprov-sessionlog is set and vice
              versa.

              When accesslog for this database is configured and is
              logging at this suffix, it can be used as the session log
              source instead of the in-memory session log mentioned
              above. This log has the advantage of not starting afresh
              every time the server is restarted.

       <b>syncprov-nopresent TRUE | FALSE</b>
              Specify that the Present phase of refreshing should be
              skipped. This value should only be set TRUE for a syncprov
              instance on top of a log database (such as one managed by
              the accesslog overlay).  The default is FALSE.

       <b>syncprov-reloadhint TRUE | FALSE</b>
              Specify that the overlay should honor the reloadHint flag
              in the Sync Control. It must be set TRUE when using the
              accesslog overlay for delta-based syncrepl replication
              support.  The default is FALSE.
