DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       *.pcrlock files define expected TPM2 PCR measurements of
       components involved in the boot process.  <b>systemd-pcrlock</b>(1) uses
       such pcrlock files to analyze and predict TPM2 PCR measurements.
       The pcrlock files are JSON arrays that follow a subset of the <b>TCG</b>
       <b>Canonical Event Log Format (CEL-JSON)</b>[1] specification.
       Specifically the "recnum", "content", and "content_type" record
       fields are not used and ignored if present. Each pcrlock file
       defines one set of expected, ordered PCR measurements of a
       specific component of the boot.

       *.pcrlock files may be placed in various .d/ drop-in directories
       (see above for a full list). All matching files discovered in
       these directories are sorted alphabetically by their file name
       (without taking the actual directory they were found in into
       account): pcrlock files with alphabetically earlier names are
       expected to cover measurements done before those with
       alphabetically later names. In order to make positioning pcrlock
       files in the boot process convenient the files are expected (by
       convention, this is not enforced) to be named
       "<i>NNN</i>-<i>component</i>.pcrlock" (where <i>NNN</i> is a three-digit decimal
       number), for example 750-enter-initrd.pcrlock.

       For various components of the boot process more than one
       alternative pcrlock file shall be supported (i.e. "variants").
       For example to cover multiple kernels installed in parallel in
       the access policy, or multiple versions of the boot loader. This
       can be done by placing *.pcrlock.d/*.pcrlock in the drop-in dirs,
       i.e. a common directory for a specific component, that contains
       one or more pcrlock files each covering one <i>variant</i> of the
       component. Example:
       650-kernel.pcrlock.d/6.5.5-200.fc38.x86_64.pcrlock and
       650-kernel.pcrlock.d/6.5.7-100.fc38.x86_64.pcrlock

       Use <b>systemd-pcrlock list-components </b>to list all pcrlock files
       currently installed.

       Use the various <b>lock-* </b>commands of <b>systemd-pcrlock </b>to
       automatically generate suitable pcrlock files for various types
       of resources.
