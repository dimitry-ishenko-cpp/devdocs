       vtep - hardware_vtep database schema

       This schema specifies relations that a VTEP can use to integrate
       physical ports into logical switches maintained by a network
       virtualization controller such as NSX.

       Glossary:

              VTEP   VXLAN Tunnel End Point, an entity which originates
                     and/or terminates VXLAN tunnels.

              HSC    Hardware Switch Controller.

              NVC    Network Virtualization Controller, e.g. NSX.

              VRF    Virtual Routing and Forwarding instance.

   <b>Common Column</b>
       Some tables contain a column, named <b>other_config</b>. This column has
       the same form and purpose each place that it appears, so we
       describe it here to save space later.

              <b>other_config</b>: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for configuring rarely used or
                     proprietary features.

                     Some tables do not have <b>other_config </b>column because
                     no key-value pairs have yet been defined for them.

Global TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Top-level configuration for a hardware VTEP. There must be
       exactly one record in the <b>Global </b>table.

   <b>Summary:</b>
       <b>switches                      </b>set of <b>Physical_Switch</b>s
       <i>Database Configuration:</i>
         <b>managers                    </b>set of <b>Manager</b>s
       <i>Common Column:</i>
         <b>other_config                </b>map of string-string pairs

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>switches</b>: set of <b>Physical_Switch</b>s
              The physical switch or switches managed by the VTEP.

              When a physical switch integrates support for this VTEP
              schema, which is expected to be the most common case, this
              column should point to one <b>Physical_Switch </b>record that
              represents the switch itself. In another possible
              implementation, a server or a VM presents a VTEP schema
              front-end interface to one or more physical switches,
              presumably communicating with those physical switches over
              a proprietary protocol. In that case, this column would
              point to one <b>Physical_Switch </b>for each physical switch, and
              the set might change over time as the front-end server
              comes to represent a differing set of switches.

     <i>Database Configuration:</i>

       These columns primarily configure the database server
       (<b>ovsdb-server</b>), not the hardware VTEP itself.

       <b>managers</b>: set of <b>Manager</b>s
              Database clients to which the database server should
              connect or to which it should listen, along with options
              for how these connection should be configured. See the
              <b>Manager </b>table for more information.

     <i>Common Column:</i>

       The overall purpose of this column is described under <b>Common</b>
       <b>Column </b>at the beginning of this document.

       <b>other_config</b>: map of string-string pairs

   <b>Details:</b>
     <i>Core Features:</i>

       <b>target</b>: string (must be unique within table)
              Connection method for managers.

              The following connection methods are currently supported:

              <b>ssl:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified SSL <i>port</i> (default: 6640) on the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address.

                     SSL key and certificate configuration happens
                     outside the database.

              <b>tcp:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified TCP <i>port</i> (default: 6640) on the given
                     <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address.

              <b>pssl:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for SSL connections on the specified TCP
                     <i>port</i> (default: 6640). If <i>host</i>, which can either be
                     a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or an IP
                     address, is specified, then connections are
                     restricted to the resolved or specified local IP
                     address.

              <b>ptcp:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for connections on the specified TCP <i>port</i>
                     (default: 6640). If <i>host</i>, which can either be a DNS
                     name (if built with unbound library) or an IP
                     address, is specified, then connections are
                     restricted to the resolved or specified local IP
                     address.

     <i>Client Failure Detection and Handling:</i>

       <b>max_backoff</b>: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection
              attempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       <b>inactivity_probe</b>: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection
              to the client before sending an inactivity probe message.
              If the Open vSwitch database does not communicate with the
              client for the specified number of seconds, it will send a
              probe. If a response is not received for the same
              additional amount of time, the database server assumes the
              connection has been broken and attempts to reconnect.
              Default is implementation-specific. A value of 0 disables
              inactivity probes.

     <i>Status:</i>

       <b>is_connected</b>: boolean
              <b>true </b>if currently connected to this manager, <b>false</b>
              otherwise.

       <b>status : last_error</b>: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the
              connection to the manager; i.e. <b>strerror(errno)</b>. This key
              will exist only if an error has occurred.

       <b>status : state</b>: optional string, one of <b>ACTIVE</b>, <b>BACKOFF</b>,
       <b>CONNECTING</b>, <b>IDLE</b>, or <b>VOID</b>
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              <b>VOID   </b>Connection is disabled.

              <b>BACKOFF</b>
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              <b>CONNECTING</b>
                     Attempting to connect.

              <b>ACTIVE </b>Connected, remote host responsive.

              <b>IDLE   </b>Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-
                     alive.

              These values may change in the future. They are provided
              only for human consumption.

       <b>status : sec_since_connect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this manager last successfully
              connected to the database (in seconds). Value is empty if
              manager has never successfully connected.

       <b>status : sec_since_disconnect</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              The amount of time since this manager last disconnected
              from the database (in seconds). Value is empty if manager
              has never disconnected.

       <b>status : locks_held</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection holds. Omitted if the connection does not hold
              any locks.

       <b>status : locks_waiting</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection is currently waiting to acquire. Omitted if the
              connection is not waiting for any locks.

       <b>status : locks_lost</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the
              connection has had stolen by another OVSDB client. Omitted
              if no locks have been stolen from this connection.

       <b>status : n_connections</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 2
              When <b>target </b>specifies a connection method that listens for
              inbound connections (e.g. <b>ptcp: </b>or <b>pssl:</b>) and more than
              one connection is actually active, the value is the number
              of active connections. Otherwise, this key-value pair is
              omitted.

              When multiple connections are active, status columns and
              key-value pairs (other than this one) report the status of
              one arbitrarily chosen connection.

     <i>Connection Parameters:</i>

       Additional configuration for a connection between the manager and
       the database server.

       <b>other_config : dscp</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) is specified
              using 6 bits in the Type of Service (TOS) field in the IP
              header. DSCP provides a mechanism to classify the network
              traffic and provide Quality of Service (QoS) on IP
              networks. The DSCP value specified here is used when
              establishing the connection between the manager and the
              database server. If no value is specified, a default value
              of 48 is chosen. Valid DSCP values must be in the range 0
              to 63.

     <i>Error Notification:</i>

       An entry in this column indicates to the NVC that this switch has

       fault has been cleared.

       <b>switch_fault_status : mac_table_exhaustion</b>: none
              Indicates that the switch has been unable to process MAC
              entries requested by the NVC due to lack of table
              resources.

       <b>switch_fault_status : tunnel_exhaustion</b>: none
              Indicates that the switch has been unable to create
              tunnels requested by the NVC due to lack of resources.

       <b>switch_fault_status : lr_switch_bindings_fault</b>: none
              Indicates that the switch has been unable to create the
              logical router interfaces requested by the NVC due to
              conflicting configurations or a lack of hardware
              resources.

       <b>switch_fault_status : lr_static_routes_fault</b>: none
              Indicates that the switch has been unable to create the
              static routes requested by the NVC due to conflicting
              configurations or a lack of hardware resources.

       <b>switch_fault_status : lr_creation_fault</b>: none
              Indicates that the switch has been unable to create the

              configurations or a lack of hardware resources.

       <b>switch_fault_status : lr_support_fault</b>: none
              Indicates that the switch does not support logical
              routing.

       <b>switch_fault_status : unspecified_fault</b>: none
              Indicates that an error has occurred in the switch but
              that no more specific information is available.

       <b>switch_fault_status : unsupported_source_node_replication</b>: none
              Indicates that the requested source node replication mode
              cannot be supported by the physical switch; this
              specifically means in this context that the physical
              switch lacks the capability to support source node
              replication mode. This error occurs when a controller
              attempts to set source node replication mode for one of
              the logical switches that the physical switch is keeping
              context for. An NVC that observes this error should take
              appropriate action (for example reverting the logical
              switch to service node replication mode). It is
              recommended that an NVC be proactive and test for support
              of source node replication by using a test logical switch
              on vtep physical switch nodes and then trying to change
              the replication mode to source node on this logical
              switch, checking for error. The NVC could remember this
              capability per vtep physical switch. Using mixed
              replication modes on a given logical switch is not
              recommended. Service node replication mode is considered a
              basic requirement since it only requires sending a packet
              to a single transport node, hence it is not expected that
              a switch should report that service node mode cannot be
              supported.

     <i>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):</i>

       BFD, defined in RFC 5880, allows point to point detection of
       connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control
       messages. VTEPs are expected to implement BFD.

       BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a
       rate negotiated independently in each direction. Each endpoint
       specifies the rate at which it expects to receive control
       messages, and the rate at which it’s willing to transmit them. An
       endpoint which fails to receive BFD control messages for a period
       of three times the expected reception rate will signal a
       connectivity fault. In the case of a unidirectional connectivity
       issue, the system not receiving BFD control messages will signal
       the problem to its peer in the messages it transmits.

       A hardware VTEP is expected to use BFD to determine reachability
       of devices at the end of the tunnels with which it exchanges
       data. This can enable the VTEP to choose a functioning service
       node among a set of service nodes providing high availability. It
       also enables the NVC to report the health status of tunnels.

       In many cases the BFD peer of a hardware VTEP will be an Open
       vSwitch instance. The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to
       comply faithfully with the requirements put forth in RFC 5880.
       Open vSwitch does not implement the optional Authentication or
       ``Echo Mode’’ features.

     <i>BFD Local Configuration:</i>

       The HSC writes the key-value pairs in the <b>bfd_config_local </b>column
       to specify the local configurations to be used for BFD sessions
       on this tunnel.

       <b>bfd_config_local : bfd_dst_mac</b>: optional string
              Set to an Ethernet address in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>
              to set the MAC expected as destination for received BFD
              packets. The default is <b>00:23:20:00:00:01</b>.

       <b>bfd_config_local : bfd_dst_ip</b>: optional string
              Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address that is
              expected as destination for received BFD packets. The
              default is <b>169.254.1.0</b>.

     <i>BFD Remote Configuration:</i>

       The <b>bfd_config_remote </b>column is the remote counterpart of the
       <b>bfd_config_local </b>column. The NVC writes the key-value pairs in
       this column.

       <b>bfd_config_remote : bfd_dst_mac</b>: optional string
              Set to an Ethernet address in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>
              to set the destination MAC to be used for transmitted BFD
              packets. The default is <b>00:23:20:00:00:01</b>.

       <b>bfd_config_remote : bfd_dst_ip</b>: optional string
              Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address used as
              destination for transmitted BFD packets. The default is
              <b>169.254.1.1</b>.

     <i>BFD Parameters:</i>

       The NVC sets up key-value pairs in the <b>bfd_params </b>column to
       enable and configure BFD.

       <b>bfd_params : enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              True to enable BFD on this <b>Tunnel</b>. If not specified, BFD
              will not be enabled by default.

       <b>bfd_params : min_rx</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 1
              The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD
              session offers to receive BFD control messages. The remote
              endpoint may choose to send messages at a slower rate.
              Defaults to <b>1000</b>.

       <b>bfd_params : min_tx</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 1
              The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD
              session is willing to transmit BFD control messages.
              Messages will actually be transmitted at a slower rate if
              the remote endpoint is not willing to receive as quickly
              as specified. Defaults to <b>100</b>.

       <b>bfd_params : decay_min_rx</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              An alternate receive interval, in milliseconds, that must
              be greater than or equal to <b>bfd_params:min_rx</b>. The
              implementation should switch from <b>bfd_params:min_rx </b>to
              <b>bfd_params:decay_min_rx </b>when there is no obvious incoming
              data traffic at the tunnel, to reduce the CPU and
              bandwidth cost of monitoring an idle tunnel. This feature
              may be disabled by setting a value of 0. This feature is
              reset whenever <b>bfd_params:decay_min_rx </b>or
              <b>bfd_params:min_rx </b>changes.

       <b>bfd_params : forwarding_if_rx</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or
       <b>false</b>
              When <b>true</b>, traffic received on the <b>Tunnel </b>is used to
              indicate the capability of packet I/O. BFD control packets
              are still transmitted and received. At least one BFD
              control packet must be received every 100 *
              <b>bfd_params:min_rx </b>amount of time. Otherwise, even if
              traffic is received, the <b>bfd_params:forwarding </b>will be
              <b>false</b>.

       <b>bfd_params : cpath_down</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Set to true to notify the remote endpoint that traffic
              should not be forwarded to this system for some reason
              other than a connectivity failure on the interface being
              monitored. The typical underlying reason is ``concatenated
              path down,’’ that is, that connectivity beyond the local
              system is down. Defaults to false.

       <b>bfd_params : check_tnl_key</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Set to true to make BFD accept only control messages with
              a tunnel key of zero. By default, BFD accepts control
              messages with any tunnel key.

     <i>BFD Status:</i>

       The VTEP sets key-value pairs in the <b>bfd_status </b>column to report
       the status of BFD on this tunnel. When BFD is not enabled, with
       <b>bfd_params:enable</b>, the HSC clears all key-value pairs from
       <b>bfd_status</b>.

       <b>bfd_status : enabled</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Set to true if the BFD session has been successfully
              enabled. Set to false if the VTEP cannot support BFD or
              has insufficient resources to enable BFD on this tunnel.
              The NVC will disable the BFD monitoring on the other side
              of the tunnel once this value is set to false.

       <b>bfd_status : state</b>: optional string, one of <b>admin_down</b>, <b>down</b>,
       <b>init</b>, or <b>up</b>
              Reports the state of the BFD session. The BFD session is
              fully healthy and negotiated if <b>UP</b>.

       <b>bfd_status : forwarding</b>: optional string, either <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>
              Reports whether the BFD session believes this <b>Tunnel </b>may
              be used to forward traffic. Typically this means the local
              session is signaling <b>UP</b>, and the remote system isn’t
              signaling a problem such as concatenated path down.

       <b>bfd_status : diagnostic</b>: optional string
              A diagnostic code specifying the local system’s reason for
              the last change in session state. The error messages are
              defined in section 4.1 of [RFC 5880].

       <b>bfd_status : remote_state</b>: optional string, one of <b>admin_down</b>,
       <b>down</b>, <b>init</b>, or <b>up</b>
              Reports the state of the remote endpoint’s BFD session.

       <b>bfd_status : remote_diagnostic</b>: optional string
              A diagnostic code specifying the remote system’s reason
              for the last change in session state. The error messages
              are defined in section 4.1 of [RFC 5880].

       <b>bfd_status : info</b>: optional string
              A short message providing further information about the
              BFD status (possibly including reasons why BFD could not
              be enabled).

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>vlan_bindings</b>: map of integer-<b>Logical_Switch </b>pairs, key in range
       0 to 4,095
              Identifies how VLANs on the physical port are bound to
              logical switches. If, for example, the map contains a
              (VLAN, logical switch) pair, a packet that arrives on the
              port in the VLAN is considered to belong to the paired
              logical switch. A value of zero in the VLAN field means
              that untagged traffic on the physical port is mapped to
              the logical switch.

       <b>acl_bindings</b>: map of integer-<b>ACL </b>pairs, key in range 0 to 4,095
              Attach Access Control Lists (ACLs) to the physical port.
              The column consists of a map of VLAN tags to <b>ACL</b>s. If the
              value of the VLAN tag in the map is 0, this means that the
              ACL is associated with the entire physical port. Non-zero
              values mean that the ACL is to be applied only on packets
              carrying that VLAN tag value. Switches will not
              necessarily support matching on the VLAN tag for all ACLs,
              and unsupported ACL bindings will cause errors to be
              reported. The binding of an ACL to a specific VLAN and the
              binding of an ACL to the entire physical port should not
              be combined on a single physical port. That is, a mix of
              zero and non-zero keys in the map is not recommended.

       <b>vlan_stats</b>: map of integer-<b>Logical_Binding_Stats </b>pairs, key in
       range 0 to 4,095
              Statistics for VLANs bound to logical switches on the
              physical port. An implementation that fully supports such
              statistics would populate this column with a mapping for
              every VLAN that is bound in <b>vlan_bindings</b>. An
              implementation that does not support such statistics or
              only partially supports them would not populate this
              column or partially populate it, respectively. A value of
              zero in the VLAN field refers to untagged traffic on the
              physical port.

     <i>Identification:</i>

       <b>name</b>: string
              Symbolic name for the port. The name ought to be unique
              within a given <b>Physical_Switch</b>, but the database is not
              capable of enforcing this.

       <b>description</b>: string
              An extended description for the port.

     <i>Error Notification:</i>

       An entry in this column indicates to the NVC that the physical
       port has encountered a fault. The switch must clear this column
       when the error has been cleared.

       <b>port_fault_status : invalid_vlan_map</b>: none
              Indicates that a VLAN-to-logical-switch mapping requested
              by the controller could not be instantiated by the switch
              because of a conflict with local configuration.

       <b>port_fault_status : invalid_ACL_binding</b>: none
              Indicates that an error has occurred in associating an ACL
              with a port.

       <b>port_fault_status : unspecified_fault</b>: none

     <i>Per Logical-Switch Tunnel Key:</i>

       Tunnel protocols tend to have a field that allows the tunnel to
       be partitioned into sub-tunnels: VXLAN has a VNI, GRE and STT
       have a key, CAPWAP has a WSI, and so on. We call these
       generically ``tunnel keys.’’ Given that one needs to use a tunnel
       key at all, there are at least two reasonable ways to assign
       their values:

              •      Per <b>Logical_Switch</b>+<b>Physical_Locator </b>pair. That is,
                     each logical switch may be assigned a different
                     tunnel key on every <b>Physical_Locator</b>. This model is
                     especially flexible.

                     In this model, <b>Physical_Locator </b>carries the tunnel
                     key. Therefore, one <b>Physical_Locator </b>record will
                     exist for each logical switch carried at a given IP
                     destination.

              •      Per <b>Logical_Switch</b>. That is, every tunnel
                     associated with a particular logical switch carries
                     the same tunnel key, regardless of the
                     <b>Physical_Locator </b>to which the tunnel is addressed.
                     This model may ease switch implementation because
                     it imposes fewer requirements on the hardware
                     datapath.

                     In this model, <b>Logical_Switch </b>carries the tunnel
                     key. Therefore, one <b>Physical_Locator </b>record will
                     exist for each IP destination.

       <b>tunnel_key</b>: optional integer
              This column is used only in the tunnel key per
              <b>Logical_Switch </b>model (see above), because only in that
              model is there a tunnel key associated with a logical
              switch.

              For <b>vxlan_over_ipv4 </b>encapsulation, when the tunnel key per
              <b>Logical_Switch </b>model is in use, this column is the VXLAN
              VNI that identifies a logical switch. It must be in the
              range 0 to 16,777,215.

     <i>Replication Mode:</i>

       For handling L2 broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic,
       packets can be sent to all members of a logical switch referenced
       by a physical switch. There are different modes to replicate the
       packets. The default mode of replication is to send the traffic
       to a service node, which can be a hypervisor, server or
       appliance, and let the service node handle replication to other
       transport nodes (hypervisors or other VTEP physical switches).
       This mode is called service node replication. An alternate mode
       of replication, called source node replication involves the
       source node sending to all other transport nodes. Hypervisors are
       always responsible for doing their own replication for locally
       attached VMs in both modes. Service node replication mode is the
       default and considered a basic requirement because it only
       requires sending the packet to a single transport node.

       <b>replication_mode</b>: optional string, either <b>service_node </b>or
       <b>source_node</b>
              This optional column defines the replication mode per
              <b>Logical_Switch</b>. There are 2 valid values, <b>service_node </b>and
              <b>source_node</b>. If the column is not set, the replication
              mode defaults to service_node.

     <i>Identification:</i>

       <b>name</b>: string (must be unique within table)
              Symbolic name for the logical switch.

       <b>description</b>: string

              its switch login banner.

              Maps from an IPv4 or IPv6 address prefix in CIDR notation
              to a logical switch. Multiple prefixes may map to the same
              switch. By writing a 32-bit (or 128-bit for v6) address
              with a /N prefix length, both the router’s interface
              address and the subnet prefix can be configured. For

       A distributed logical router is implemented by a set of VTEPs

       This table contains the MACs that are used by the VTEPs of a

       controller may log an error if an ACL entry requires it to match
       on an incompatible mixture of fields.

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>sequence</b>: integer
              The sequence number for the ACL entry for the purpose of
              ordering entries in an ACL. Lower numbered entries are
              matched before higher numbered entries.

     <i>L2 fields:</i>

       <b>source_mac</b>: optional string
              Source MAC address, in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>

       <b>dest_mac</b>: optional string
              Destination MAC address, in the form <i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>:<i>xx</i>

       <b>ethertype</b>: optional string
              Ethertype in hexadecimal, in the form <i>0xAAAA</i>

     <i>L3/L4 fields:</i>

       <b>source_ip</b>: optional string
              Source IP address, in the form <i>xx.xx.xx.xx</i> for IPv4 or
              appropriate colon-separated hexadecimal notation for IPv6.

       <b>source_mask</b>: optional string
              Mask that determines which bits of source_ip to match on,
              in the form <i>xx.xx.xx.xx</i> for IPv4 or appropriate colon-
              separated hexadecimal notation for IPv6.

       <b>dest_ip</b>: optional string
              Destination IP address, in the form <i>xx.xx.xx.xx</i> for IPv4
              or appropriate colon-separated hexadecimal notation for
              IPv6.

       <b>dest_mask</b>: optional string
              Mask that determines which bits of dest_ip to match on, in
              the form <i>xx.xx.xx.xx</i> for IPv4 or appropriate colon-
              separated hexadecimal notation for IPv6.

       <b>protocol</b>: optional integer
              Protocol number in the IPv4 header, or value of the "next
              header" field in the IPv6 header.

       <b>source_port_min</b>: optional integer
              Lower end of the range of source port values. The value
              specified is included in the range.

       <b>source_port_max</b>: optional integer
              Upper end of the range of source port values. The value
              specified is included in the range.

       <b>dest_port_min</b>: optional integer
              Lower end of the range of destination port values. The
              value specified is included in the range.

       <b>dest_port_max</b>: optional integer
              Upper end of the range of destination port values. The
              value specified is included in the range.

       <b>tcp_flags</b>: optional integer
              Integer representing the value of TCP flags to match. For
              example, the SYN flag is the second least significant bit
              in the TCP flags. Hence a value of 2 would indicate that
              the "SYN" flag should be set (assuming an appropriate
              mask).

       <b>tcp_flags_mask</b>: optional integer
              Integer representing the mask to apply when matching TCP
              flags. For example, a value of 2 would imply that the
              "SYN" flag should be matched and all other flags ignored.

       <b>icmp_type</b>: optional integer
              ICMP type to be matched.

       <b>icmp_code</b>: optional integer
              ICMP code to be matched.

       <b>direction</b>: string, either <b>egress </b>or <b>ingress</b>
              Direction of traffic to match on the specified port,
              either "ingress" (toward the logical switch or router) or
              "egress" (leaving the logical switch or router).

       <b>action</b>: string, either <b>deny </b>or <b>permit</b>
              Action to take for this rule, either "permit" or "deny".

     <i>Error Notification:</i>

       An entry in this column indicates to the NVC that the ACL could
       not be configured as requested. The switch must clear this column
       when the error has been cleared.

       <b>acle_fault_status : invalid_acl_entry</b>: none
              Indicates that an ACL entry requested by the controller
              could not be instantiated by the switch, e.g. because it
              requires an unsupported combination of fields to be
              matched.

       <b>acle_fault_status : unspecified_fault</b>: none
              Indicates that an error has occurred in configuring the
              ACL entry but no more specific information is available.
</pre> <h2>
ACL TABLE </h2>
<pre>
       Access Control List table. Each ACL is constructed as a set of
       entries from the <b>ACL_entry </b>table. Packets that are not matched by
       any entry in the ACL are allowed by default.

   <b>Summary:</b>
       <b>acl_entries                   </b>set of 1 or more <b>ACL_entry</b>s
       <b>acl_name                      </b>string (must be unique within
                                     table)
       <i>Error Notification:</i>
         <b>acl_fault_status : invalid_acl</b>
                                     none
         <b>acl_fault_status : resource_shortage</b>
                                     none
         <b>acl_fault_status : unspecified_fault</b>
                                     none

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>acl_entries</b>: set of 1 or more <b>ACL_entry</b>s
              A set of references to entries in the <b>ACL_entry </b>table.

       <b>acl_name</b>: string (must be unique within table)
              A human readable name for the ACL, which may (for example)
              be displayed on the switch CLI.

     <i>Error Notification:</i>

       An entry in this column indicates to the NVC that the ACL could
       not be configured as requested. The switch must clear this column
       when the error has been cleared.

       <b>acl_fault_status : invalid_acl</b>: none
              Indicates that an ACL requested by the controller could
              not be instantiated by the switch, e.g., because it
              requires an unsupported combination of fields to be
              matched.

       <b>acl_fault_status : resource_shortage</b>: none
              Indicates that an ACL requested by the controller could
              not be instantiated by the switch due to a shortage of
              resources (e.g. TCAM space).

       <b>acl_fault_status : unspecified_fault</b>: none
              Indicates that an error has occurred in configuring the
              ACL but no more specific information is available.
