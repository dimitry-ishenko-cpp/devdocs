NAME </h2>
<pre>
       trace-cmd.dat.v7 - trace-cmd version 7 file format
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>trace-cmd.dat </b>ignore
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The trace-cmd(1) utility produces a "trace.dat" file. The file
       may also be named anything depending if the user specifies a
       different output name, but it must have a certain binary format.
       The file is used by trace-cmd to save kernel traces into it and
       be able to extract the trace from it at a later point (see
       <a href="../man1/trace-cmd-report.1.html">trace-cmd-report(1)</a>).
</pre> <h2>
INITIAL FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
           The first three bytes contain the magic value:

           0x17 0x08  0x44

           The next 7 bytes contain the characters:

           "tracing"

           The next set of characters contain a null '\0' terminated string
           that contains the version of the file:

           "7\0"

           The next 1 byte contains the flags for the file endianess:

           0 = little endian
           1 = big endian

           The next byte contains the number of bytes per "long" value:

           4 - 32-bit long values
           8 - 64-bit long values

           Note: This is the long size of the target's user space. Not the
           kernel space size.

           [ Now all numbers are written in file defined endianess. ]

           The next 4 bytes are a 32-bit word that defines what the traced
           host machine page size was.

           The compression algorithm header is written next:
              "name\0version\0"
           where "name" and "version" are strings, name and version of the
           compression algorithm used to compress the trace file. If the name
           is "none", the data in the file is not compressed.

           The next 8 bytes are 64-bit integer, the offset within the file where
           the first OPTIONS section is located.

           The rest of the file consists of different sections. The only mandatory
           is the first OPTIONS section, all others are optional. The location and
           the order of the sections is not strict. Each section starts with a header:
</pre> <h2>
FORMAT OF THE SECTION HEADER </h2>
<pre>
           &lt;2 bytes&gt; unsigned short integer, ID of the section.
           &lt;2 bytes&gt; unsigned short integer, section flags:
             1 = the section is compressed.
           &lt;4 bytes&gt; ID of a string, description of the section.
           &lt;8 bytes&gt; long long unsigned integer, size of the section in the file.

           If the section is compressed, the above is the compressed size.
           The section must be uncompressed on reading. The described format of
           the sections refers to the uncompressed data.
</pre> <h2>
COMPRESSION FORMAT OF THE FILE SECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
           Some of the sections in the file may be compressed with the compression algorithm,
           specified in the compression algorithm header. Compressed sections have a compression
           header, written after the section header and right before the compressed data:
             &lt;4 bytes&gt; unsigned int, size of compressed data in this section.
             &lt;4 bytes&gt; unsigned int, size of uncompressed data.
             &lt;data&gt; binary compressed data, with the specified size.
</pre> <h2>
COMPRESSION FORMAT OF THE TRACE DATA </h2>
<pre>
           There are two special sections, BUFFER FLYRECORD and BUFFER LATENCY, containing
           trace data. These sections may be compressed with the compression algorithm, specified
           in the compression header. Usually the size of these sections is huge, that's why its
           compression format is different from the other sections. The trace data is compressed
           in chunks The size of one chunk is specified in the file creation time. The format
           of compressed trace data is:
              &lt;4 bytes&gt; unsigned int, count of chunks.
              Follows the compressed chunks of given count. For each chunk:
                 &lt;4 bytes&gt; unsigned int, size of compressed data in this chunk.
                 &lt;4 bytes&gt; unsigned int, size of uncompressed data, aligned with the trace page size.
                 &lt;data&gt; binary compressed data, with the specified size.
           These chunks must be uncompressed on reading. The described format of
           trace data refers to the uncompressed data.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS SECTION </h2>
<pre>
           Section ID: 0

           This is the the only mandatory section in the file. There can be multiple
           options sections, the first one is located at the offset specified right
           after the compression algorithm header. The section consists of multiple
           trace options, each option has the following format:
             &lt;2 bytes&gt; unsigned short integer, ID of the option.
             &lt;4 bytes&gt; unsigned integer, size of the option's data.

           Note: The size of the second field \fBcommit\fR contains the target

           field: local_t commit;        offset:8;       \fBsize:8;\fR   signed:1;

           shows the kernel has a 64-bit long.

           For the number of times defined in the previous 4 bytes is the
           following:

           8 bytes for the size of the event format file.

           The event format file copied from the target machine:

           This information can be found in:
           debugfs/tracing/printk_formats

           The next 4 bytes are a 32-bit word containing the size of the

</pre> <h2>
BUFFER FLYRECORD SECTION </h2>
<pre>
           This section contains flyrecord tracing data, collected in one trace instance.
           The data is saved per CPU. Each BUFFER FLYRECORD section has a corresponding BUFFER
           option, containing information about saved CPU's trace data. Padding is placed between
           the section header and the CPU data, placing the CPU data at a page aligned (target page)
           position in the file.

           This data is copied directly from the Ftrace ring buffer and is of the
           same format as the ring buffer specified by the event header files
           loaded in the header format file.

           The trace-cmd tool will try to \fBmmap(2)\fR the data page by page with the
           target's page size if possible. If it fails to mmap, it will just read the
           data instead.

       BUFFER TEXT SECTION

           .ft C
             Section ID: 22

             This section contains latency tracing data, ASCII text taken from the
             target's debugfs/tracing/trace file.

           STRINGS SECTION
           .ft

           Section ID: 15

           All strings of the trace file metadata are stored in a string section within the file. The section
           contains a list of nul terminated ASCII strings. An ID of the string is used in the file
           meta data, which is the offset of the actual string into the string section. Strings can be stored
           into multiple string sections in the file.
