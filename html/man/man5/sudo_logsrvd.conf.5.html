NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sudo_logsrvd.conf </b>— configuration for sudo_logsrvd
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sudo_logsrvd.conf </b>file is used to configure the <b>sudo_logsrvd</b>
       log server.  It uses an INI-style format made up of sections in
       square brackets and “key = value” pairs specific to each section
       below the section name.  Depending on the key, values may be
       integers, booleans, or strings.  Section and key names are not
       case sensitive, but values are.

       The pound sign (‘#’) is used to indicate a comment.  Both the
       comment character and any text after it, up to the end of the
       line, are ignored.  Lines beginning with a semi-colon (‘;’) are
       also ignored.

       Long lines can be continued with a backslash (‘\’) as the last
       character on the line.  Leading white space is removed from the
       beginning of lines even when the continuation character is used.

       The “EXAMPLES” section contains a copy of the default
       <b>sudo_logsrvd.conf </b>file.

       The following configuration sections are recognized:

        <b>•  </b>server
        <b>•  </b>relay
        <b>•  </b>iolog
        <b>•  </b>eventlog
        <b>•  </b>syslog
        <b>•  </b>logfile

       Each section is described in detail below.

   <b>server</b>
       The <i>server</i> section configures the address and port the server
       will listen on.  The following keys are recognized:

       listen_address = host[:port][(tls)]
             The host name or IP address, optional port to listen on and
             an optional Transport Layer Security (TLS) flag in
             parentheses.

             The host may be a host name, an IPv4 address, an IPv6
             address in square brackets or the wild card entry ‘*’.  A
             host setting of ‘*’ will cause <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>to listen on
             all configured network interfaces.

             If the optional tls flag is present, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will
             secure the connection with TLS version 1.2 or 1.3.
             Versions of TLS prior to 1.2 are not supported.  See
             <i>sudo_logsrvd</i>(8) for details on generating TLS keys and
             certificates.

             If a port is specified, it may either be a port number or a
             known service name as defined by the system service name
             database.  If no port is specified, port 30343 will be used
             for plaintext connections and port 30344 will be used for
             TLS connections.

             The default value is:
                   listen_address = *:30343
                   listen_address = *:30344(tls)
             which will listen on all configured network interfaces for
             both plaintext and TLS connections.  Multiple
             <i>listen_address</i> lines may be specified to listen on more
             than one port or interface.

       server_log = string
             Where to log server warning and error messages.  Supported
             values are <i>none</i>, <i>stderr</i>, <i>syslog</i>, or a path name beginning
             with the ‘/’ character.  A value of <i>stderr</i> is only
             effective when used in conjunction with the <b>-n </b>option.  The
             default value is <i>syslog</i>.

       pid_file = path
             The path to the file containing the process ID of the
             running <b>sudo_logsrvd</b>.  If set to an empty value, or if
             <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>is run with the <b>-n </b>option, no <i>pid_file</i> will be
             created.  If <i>pid_file</i> refers to a symbolic link, it will be
             ignored.  The default value is <i>/run/sudo/sudo_logsrvd.pid</i>.

       tcp_keepalive = boolean
             If true, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will enable the TCP keepalive socket
             option on the client connection.  This enables the periodic
             transmission of keepalive messages to the client.  If the
             client does not respond to a message in time, the
             connection will be closed.  Defaults to <i>true</i>.

       timeout = number
             The amount of time, in seconds, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will wait for
             the client to respond.  A value of 0 will disable the
             timeout.  The default value is <i>30</i>.

       tls_cacert = path
             The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM
             format, to use instead of the system's default certificate
             authority database when authenticating clients.  The
             default is to use <i>/etc/ssl/sudo/cacert.pem</i> if it exists,
             otherwise the system's default certificate authority
             database is used.

       tls_cert = path
             The path to the server's certificate file, in PEM format.
             The default value is <i>/etc/ssl/sudo/certs/logsrvd_cert.pem</i>.

       tls_checkpeer = bool
             If true, client certificates will be validated by
             <b>sudo_logsrvd</b>; clients without a valid certificate will be
             unable to connect.  If false, no validation of client
             certificates will be performed.  It true and client
             certificates are created using a private certificate
             authority, the <i>tls_cacert</i> setting must be set to a CA
             bundle that contains the CA certificate used to generate
             the client certificate.  The default value is <i>false</i>.

       tls_ciphers_v12 = string
             A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS
             version 1.2 only, separated by a colon ‘:’.  See the
             “CIPHER LIST FORMAT” section in <i>openssl-ciphers</i>(1) for full
             details.  The default value is “HIGH:!aNULL” which consists
             of encryption cipher suites with key lengths larger than
             128 bits, and some cipher suites with 128-bit keys.  Cipher
             suites that offer no authentication are excluded.

       tls_ciphers_v13 = string
             A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS
             version 1.3 only, separated by a colon ‘:’.  Supported
             cipher suites depend on the version of OpenSSL used, but
             should include the following:

                   TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
                   TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
                   TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
                   TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256
                   TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256

             The default cipher suite is “TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384”.

       tls_dhparams = path
             The path to a file containing custom Diffie-Hellman
             parameters in PEM format.  This file can be created with
             the following command:

             openssl dhparam -out /etc/sudo_logsrvd_dhparams.pem 2048

             By default, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will use the OpenSSL defaults for
             Diffie-Hellman key generation.

       tls_key = path
             The path to the server's private key file, in PEM format.
             The default value is <i>/etc/ssl/sudo/private/logsrvd_key.pem</i>.

       tls_verify = bool
             If true, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will validate its own certificate at
             startup time or when the configuration is changed.  If
             false, no verification is performed of the server
             certificate.  When using self-signed certificates without a
             certificate authority, this setting should be set to false.
             The default value is <i>true</i>.

   <b>relay</b>
       The <i>relay</i> section configures the optional logsrv relay host and
       port the server will connect to.  The TLS configuration keys are
       optional, by default the corresponding keys in the “server”
       section will be used.  They are only present in this section to
       make it possible for the relay connection to use a different set
       of TLS parameters from the client-facing server.  The following
       keys are recognized:

       connect_timeout = number
             The amount of time, in seconds, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will wait for
             the connection to a <i>relay_host</i> (see below) to complete.
             Once the connection is complete, the <i>timeout</i> setting
             controls the amount of time <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will wait for the
             relay to respond.  A value of 0 will disable the timeout.
             The default value is <i>30</i>.

       relay_dir = path
             The directory in which log messages are temporarily stored
             before they are sent to the relay host.  Messages are
             stored in the wire format specified by <i>sudo_logsrv.proto</i>(5)
             The default value is <i>/var/log/sudo_logsrvd</i>.

       relay_host = host[:port][(tls)]
             The relay host name or IP address, optional port to connect
             to and an optional Transport Layer Security (TLS) flag in
             parentheses.  The syntax is identical to <i>listen_address</i> in
             the “server” section with one exception: the wild card ‘*’
             syntax is not supported.

             When this setting is enabled, messages from the client will
             be forwarded to one of the specified relay hosts instead of
             being stored locally.  The <i>host</i> could be running an
             instance of <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>or another server that supports
             the <i>sudo_logsrv.proto</i>(5) protocol.

             If multiple <i>relay_host</i> lines are specified, the first
             available relay host will be used.

       retry_interval = number
             The number of seconds to wait after a connection error
             before making a new attempt to forward a message to a relay
             host.  The default value is <i>30</i>.

       store_first = boolean
             If true, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will store logs locally before
             relaying them.  Once the log is complete, a connection to
             the relay host is opened and the log is relayed.  If the
             network connection is interrupted before the log can be
             fully transferred, it will be retransmitted later.  The
             default is to relay logs in real-time.

       tcp_keepalive = boolean
             If true, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will enable the TCP keepalive socket
             option on the relay connection.  This enables the periodic
             transmission of keepalive messages to the relay server.  If
             the relay does not respond to a message in time, the
             connection will be closed.

       timeout = number
             The amount of time, in seconds, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will wait for
             the relay server to respond after a connection has
             succeeded.  A value of 0 will disable the timeout.  The
             default value is <i>30</i>.

       tls_cacert = path
             The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM
             format, to use instead of the system's default certificate
             authority database when authenticating clients.  The
             default is to use the value specified in the “server”
             section, or the system's default certificate authority
             database if no value is set.

       tls_cert = path
             The path to the server's certificate file, in PEM format.
             The default is to use the value specified in the “server”
             section.

       tls_checkpeer = bool
             If true, the relay host's certificate will be validated by
             <b>sudo_logsrvd</b>; connections to a relay without a valid
             certificate will fail.  If false, no validation of relay
             certificates will be performed.  It true and relay
             certificates are created using a private certificate
             authority, the <i>tls_cacert</i> setting must be set to a CA
             bundle that contains the CA certificate used to generate
             the relay certificate.  The default is to use the value
             specified in the “server” section.

       tls_ciphers_v12 = string
             A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS
             version 1.2 only, separated by a colon ‘:’.  See the
             “CIPHER LIST FORMAT” section in <i>openssl-ciphers</i>(1) for full
             details.  The default is to use the value specified in the
             “server” section.

       tls_ciphers_v13 = string
             A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS
             version 1.3 only, separated by a colon ‘:’.  Supported
             cipher suites depend on the version of OpenSSL used, see
             the “server” section for more information.  The default is
             to use the value specified in the “server” section.

       tls_dhparams = path
             The path to a file containing custom Diffie-Hellman
             parameters in PEM format.  The default is to use the value
             specified in the “server” section.

       tls_key = path
             The path to the server's private key file, in PEM format.
             The default is to use the value specified in the “server”
             section.

       tls_verify = bool
             If true, the server's certificate used for relaying will be
             verified at startup.  If false, no verification is
             performed of the server certificate.  When using self-
             signed certificates without a certificate authority, this
             setting should be set to false.  The default is to use the
             value specified in the “server” section.

   <b>iolog</b>
       The <i>iolog</i> section configures I/O log parameters.  These settings
       are identical to the I/O configuration in <i>sudoers</i>(5).  The
       following keys are recognized:

       iolog_compress = boolean
             If set, I/O logs will be compressed using <b>zlib</b>.  Enabling
             compression can make it harder to view the logs in real-
             time as the program is executing due to buffering.  The
             default value is <i>false</i>.

       iolog_dir = path
             The top-level directory to use when constructing the path
             name for the I/O log directory.  The session sequence
             number, if any, is stored in the directory.  The default
             value is <i>/var/log/sudo-io</i>.

             The following percent (‘%’) escape sequences are supported:

             %{seq}
                   expanded to a monotonically increasing base-36
                   sequence number, such as 0100A5, where every two
                   digits are used to form a new directory, e.g.,
                   <i>01/00/A5</i>

             %{user}
                   expanded to the invoking user's login name

             %{group}
                   expanded to the name of the invoking user's real
                   group-ID

             %{runas_user}
                   expanded to the login name of the user the command
                   will be run as (e.g., root)

             %{runas_group}
                   expanded to the group name of the user the command
                   will be run as (e.g., wheel)

             %{hostname}
                   expanded to the local host name without the domain
                   name

             %{command}
                   expanded to the base name of the command being run

             In addition, any escape sequences supported by the system's
             <i>strftime</i>(3) function will be expanded.

             To include a literal ‘%’ character, the string ‘%%’ should
             be used.

       iolog_file = path
             The path name, relative to <i>iolog_dir</i>, in which to store I/O
             logs.  It is possible for <i>iolog_file</i> to contain directory
             components.  The default value is “%{seq}”.

             See the <i>iolog_dir</i> setting above for a list of supported
             percent (‘%’) escape sequences.

             In addition to the escape sequences, path names that end in
             six or more <i>X</i>s will have the <i>X</i>s replaced with a unique
             combination of digits and letters, similar to the <i>mktemp</i>(3)
             function.

             If the path created by concatenating <i>iolog_dir</i> and
             <i>iolog_file</i> already exists, the existing I/O log file will
             be truncated and overwritten unless <i>iolog_file</i> ends in six
             or more <i>X</i>s.

       iolog_flush = boolean
             If set, I/O log data is flushed to disk after each write
             instead of buffering it.  This makes it possible to view
             the logs in real-time as the program is executing but may
             significantly reduce the effectiveness of I/O log
             compression.  I/O logs are always flushed before sending a
             commit point to the client regardless of this setting.  The
             default value is <i>true</i>.

       iolog_group = name
             The group name to look up when setting the group-ID on new
             I/O log files and directories.  If <i>iolog_group</i> is not set,
             the primary group-ID of the user specified by <i>iolog_user is</i>
             <i>used.</i> If neither <i>iolog_group</i> nor <i>iolog_user</i> are set, I/O
             log files and directories are created with group-ID 0.

       iolog_mode = mode
             The file mode to use when creating I/O log files.  Mode
             bits for read and write permissions for owner, group, or
             other are honored, everything else is ignored.  The file
             permissions will always include the owner read and write
             bits, even if they are not present in the specified mode.
             When creating I/O log directories, search (execute) bits
             are added to match the read and write bits specified by
             <i>iolog_mode</i>.  The default value is <i>0600</i>.

       iolog_user = name
             The user name to look up when setting the owner of new I/O
             log files and directories.  If <i>iolog_group</i> is set, it will
             be used instead of the user's primary group-ID.  By
             default, I/O log files and directories are created with
             user and group-ID 0.

       log_passwords = bool
             Most programs that require a user's password will disable
             echo before reading the password to avoid displaying the
             plaintext password on the screen.  However, if terminal
             input is being logged, the password will still be present
             in the I/O log.  If <i>log_passwords</i> is set to <i>false</i>,
             <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will attempt to prevent passwords from being
             logged.  It does this by using the regular expressions in
             <i>passprompt_regex</i> to match a password prompt in the terminal
             output buffer.  When a match is found, input characters in
             the I/O log will be replaced with ‘*’ until either a line
             feed or carriage return is found in the terminal input or a
             new terminal output buffer is received.  If, however, a
             program displays characters as the user types them (such as
             <b>sudo </b>when the <i>pwfeedback</i> option is set), only the first
             character of the password will be replaced in the I/O log.
             The default value is <i>true</i>.

       maxseq = number
             The maximum sequence number that will be substituted for
             the “%{seq}” escape in the I/O log file (see the <i>iolog_dir</i>
             description above for more information).  While the value
             substituted for “%{seq}” is in base 36, <i>maxseq</i> itself
             should be expressed in decimal.  Values larger than
             2176782336 (which corresponds to the base 36 sequence
             number “ZZZZZZ”) will be silently truncated to 2176782336.
             The default value is <i>2176782336</i>.

       passprompt_regex = string
             One or more POSIX extended regular expressions used to
             match password prompts in the terminal output when
             <i>log_passwords</i> is disabled.  As an extension, if the regular
             expression begins with “(?i)”, it will be matched in a
             case-insensitive manner.  Multiple <i>passprompt_regex</i>
             settings may be specified.  Each regular expression is
             limited to 1024 characters.  The default value is
             “[Pp]assword[: ]*”.

   <b>eventlog</b>
       The <i>eventlog</i> section configures how (and if) security policy
       events are logged.

       log_type = string
             Where to log accept, reject, and alert events reported by
             the policy.  Supported values are <i>syslog</i>, <i>logfile</i>, and
             <i>none</i>.  The default value is <i>syslog</i>.

       log_exit = boolean
             If true, <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will log an event when a command
             exits or is terminated by a signal.  Defaults to <i>false</i>.

       log_format = string
             The event log format.  Supported log formats are:

             json  Currently, this is an alias for <i>json_pretty</i>.  In a
                   future version of <b>sudo_logsrvd</b>, <i>json</i> will be
                   equivalent to <i>json_compact</i>.  JSON log entries contain
                   the full contents of the accept, reject, exit and
                   alert messages.

             json_compact
                   Log events in “compact” (minified) JSON format.  Each
                   event is written as a separate JSON object on single
                   line without extraneous white space.  Due to
                   limitations of the protocol, JSON events sent via
                   <i>syslog</i> may be truncated.

             json_pretty
                   Log events in “pretty” JSON format.  When logging to
                   a file, the entire file is treated as a single JSON
                   object consisting of multiple events, each event
                   spanning multiple lines.  When logging via <i>syslog</i>,
                   there is no difference between the <i>json_pretty</i> and
                   <i>json_compact</i> formats.

             sudo  Log events in traditional sudo-style log format.  See
                   the <i>EVENT LOGGING</i> section in <i>sudoers</i>(5) for details.

             The default value is <i>sudo</i>.

   <b>syslog</b>
       The <i>syslog</i> section configures how events are logged via
       <i>syslog</i>(3).

       facility = string
             Syslog facility if syslog is being used for logging.
             Defaults to <i>authpriv</i>.

             The following syslog facilities are supported: <b>authpriv </b>(if
             your OS supports it), <b>auth</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>,
             <b>local2</b>, <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b>, and <b>local7</b>.

       accept_priority = string
             Syslog priority to use when the user is allowed to run a
             command and authentication is successful.  Defaults to
             <i>notice</i>.

             The following syslog priorities are supported: <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>,
             <b>debug</b>, <b>emerg</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>warning</b>, and <b>none</b>.
             Setting it to a value of <b>none </b>will disable logging of
             successful commands.

       reject_priority = string
             Syslog priority to use when the user is not allowed to run
             a command or when authentication is unsuccessful.  Defaults
             to <i>alert</i>.

             See <i>accept_priority</i> for the list of supported syslog
             priorities.

       alert_priority = string
             Syslog priority to use for event log alert messages
             received from the client.  Defaults to <i>alert</i>.

             See <i>accept_priority</i> for the list of supported syslog
             priorities.

       maxlen = number
             On many systems, <i>syslog</i>(3) has a relatively small log
             buffer.  IETF RFC 5424 states that syslog servers must
             support messages of at least 480 bytes and should support
             messages up to 2048 bytes.  By default, <b>sudo_logsrvd</b>
             creates log messages up to 960 bytes which corresponds to
             the historic BSD syslog implementation which used a 1024
             byte buffer to store the message, date, hostname, and
             program name.

             To prevent syslog messages from being truncated,
             <b>sudo_logsrvd </b>will split up sudo-style log messages that are
             larger than <i>maxlen</i> bytes.  When a message is split,
             additional parts will include the string “(command
             continued)” after the user name and before the continued
             command line arguments.  JSON-format log entries are never
             split and are not affected by <i>maxlen</i>.

       server_facility = string
             Syslog facility if syslog is being used for server warning
             messages.  See above for a list of supported facilities.
             Defaults to <i>daemon</i>

   <b>logfile</b>
       The <i>logfile</i> section consists of settings related to logging to a
       plain file (not syslog).

       path = string
             The path to the file-based event log.  This path must be
             fully-qualified and start with a ‘/’ character.  The
             default value is <i>/var/log/sudo.log</i>.

       time_format = string
             The string used when formatting the date and time for file-
             based event logs.  Formatting is performed via the system's
             <i>strftime</i>(3) function so any escape sequences supported by
             that function will be expanded.  The default value is “%h
             %e %T” which produces dates like “Oct 3 07:15:24” in the
             ‘C’ locale.
