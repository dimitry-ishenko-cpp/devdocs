NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sudo.conf </b>— configuration for sudo front-end
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sudo.conf </b>file is used to configure the <b>sudo </b>front-end.  It
       is used to configure sudo plugins, plugin-agnostic path names,
       debug flags, and other settings.

       The <b>sudo.conf </b>file supports the following directives, described
       in detail below.

       Plugin  an approval, audit, I/O logging, or security policy
               plugin

       Path    a plugin-agnostic path

       Set     a front-end setting, such as <i>disable_coredump</i> or
               <i>group_source</i>

       Debug   debug flags to aid in debugging <b>sudo</b>, <b>sudoreplay</b>, <b>visudo</b>,
               and the <b>sudoers </b>plugin.

       The pound sign (‘#’) is used to indicate a comment.  Both the
       comment character and any text after it, up to the end of the
       line, are ignored.

       Long lines can be continued with a backslash (‘\’) as the last
       character on the line.  Leading white space is removed from the
       beginning of lines even when a continuation character is used.

       Non-comment lines that don't begin with <i>Plugin</i>, <i>Path</i>, <i>Debug</i>, or
       <i>Set</i> are silently ignored.

       The <b>sudo.conf </b>file is always parsed in the ‘C’ locale.

   <b>Plugin configuration</b>
       <b>sudo </b>supports a plugin architecture for security policies and
       input/output logging.  Third parties can develop and distribute
       their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with
       the <b>sudo </b>front-end.  Plugins are dynamically loaded based on the
       contents of <b>sudo.conf</b>.

       A <i>Plugin</i> line consists of the <i>Plugin</i> keyword, followed by the
       <i>symbol_name</i> and the <i>path</i> to the dynamic shared object that
       contains the plugin.  The <i>symbol_name</i> is the name of the <i>struct</i>
       <i>approval_plugin</i>, <i>struct audit_plugin</i>, <i>struct io_plugin</i>, or <i>struct</i>
       <i>policy_plugin</i> defined by the plugin.  If a plugin implements
       multiple plugin types, there must be a <i>Plugin</i> line for each
       unique symbol name.  The <i>path</i> may be fully qualified or relative.
       If not fully qualified, it is relative to the directory specified
       by the <i>plugin_dir Path</i> setting, which defaults to
       <i>/usr/local/libexec/sudo</i>.  In other words:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so

       is equivalent to:

           Plugin sudoers_policy /usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so

       If the plugin was compiled statically into the <b>sudo </b>binary
       instead of being installed as a dynamic shared object, the <i>path</i>
       should be specified without a leading directory, as it does not
       actually exist in the file system.  For example:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so

       On AIX systems, the plugin may be either a shared object ending
       in ‘.so’ or an archive file containing a shared object ending in
       ‘.a’ with the name of the shared object in parentheses at the
       end.

       Starting with <b>sudo </b>1.8.5, any additional parameters after the
       <i>path</i> are passed as arguments to the plugin's <i>open</i> function.  For
       example, to override the compile-time default sudoers file mode:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so sudoers_mode=0440

       See the <i>sudoers</i>(5) manual for a list of supported arguments.

       The same dynamic shared object may contain multiple plugins, each
       with a different symbol name.  The file must be owned by user-ID
       0 and only writable by its owner.  Because of ambiguities that
       arise from composite policies, only a single policy plugin may be
       specified.  This limitation does not apply to I/O plugins.

       If no <b>sudo.conf </b>file is present, or if it contains no <i>Plugin</i>
       lines, the <b>sudoers </b>plugin will be used as the default security
       policy, for I/O logging (if enabled by the policy), and for
       auditing.  This is equivalent to the following:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so
           Plugin sudoers_io sudoers.so
           Plugin sudoers_audit sudoers.so

       Starting with <b>sudo </b>version 1.9.1, some of the logging
       functionality of the <b>sudoers </b>plugin has been moved from the
       policy plugin to an audit plugin.  To maintain compatibility with
       <b>sudo.conf </b>files from older <b>sudo </b>versions, if <b>sudoers </b>is
       configured as the security policy, it will be used as an audit
       plugin as well.  This guarantees that the logging behavior will
       be consistent with that of <b>sudo </b>versions 1.9.0 and below.

       For more information on the <b>sudo </b>plugin architecture, see the
       <i>sudo_plugin</i>(5) manual.

   <b>Path settings</b>
       A <i>Path</i> line consists of the <i>Path</i> keyword, followed by the name of
       the path to set and its value.  For example:

           Path intercept /usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so
           Path noexec /usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudo_noexec.so
           Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass

       If no path name is specified, features relying on the specified
       setting will be disabled.  Disabling <i>Path</i> settings is only
       supported in <b>sudo </b>version 1.8.16 and higher.

       The following plugin-agnostic paths may be set in the
       <i>/etc/sudo.conf</i> file:

       askpass
             The fully qualified path to a helper program used to read
             the user's password when no terminal is available.  This
             may be the case when <b>sudo </b>is executed from a graphical (as
             opposed to text-based) application.  The program specified
             by <i>askpass</i> should display the argument passed to it as the
             prompt and write the user's password to the standard
             output.  The value of <i>askpass</i> may be overridden by the
             SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable.

       devsearch
             An ordered, colon-separated search path of directories to
             look in for device nodes.  This is used when mapping the
             process's tty device number to a device name on systems
             that do not provide such a mechanism.  Sudo will <i>not</i>
             recurse into sub-directories.  If terminal devices may be
             located in a sub-directory of <i>/dev</i>, that path must be
             explicitly listed in <i>devsearch</i>.  The default value is
             <i>/dev/pts:/dev/vt:/dev/term:/dev/zcons:/dev/pty:/dev</i>

             This option is ignored on systems that support either the
             <b>devname</b>() or <b>_ttyname_dev</b>() functions, for example BSD,
             macOS and Solaris.

       intercept
             The path to a shared library containing a wrappers for the
             <i>execve</i>(2), <i>execl</i>(3), <i>execle</i>(3), <i>execlp</i>(3), <i>execv</i>(3),
             <i>execvp</i>(3), <i>execvpe</i>(3), and <i>system</i>(3) library functions that
             intercepts attempts to run further commands and performs a
             policy check before allowing them to be executed.  This is
             used to implement the <i>intercept</i> and <i>log_subcmds</i>
             functionality on systems that support LD_PRELOAD or the
             equivalent.

             The <i>intercept</i> path may be set to either a single fully-
             qualified path, or, for systems that support separate
             LD_PRELOAD environment variables for 32-bit and 64-bit
             executables, it may optionally be set to two fully-
             qualified paths separated by a colon (‘:’).  The first path
             should be the 32-bit version and the second the 64-bit
             version.  This two-path form is currently only supported on
             AIX and Solaris systems.  The default value is
             <i>/usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so</i>.

       noexec
             The path to a shared library containing wrappers for the
             <i>execve</i>(2), <i>execl</i>(3), <i>execle</i>(3), <i>execlp</i>(3), <i>exect</i>(3),
             <i>execv</i>(3), <i>execveat</i>(3), <i>execvP</i>(3), <i>execvp</i>(3), <i>execvpe</i>(3),
             <i>fexecve</i>(3), <i>popen</i>(3), <i>posix_spawn</i>(3), <i>posix_spawnp</i>(3),
             <i>system</i>(3), and <i>wordexp</i>(3) library functions that prevent
             the execution of further commands.  This is used to
             implement the <i>noexec</i> functionality on systems that support
             LD_PRELOAD or the equivalent.

             The <i>noexec</i> path may be set to either a single fully-
             qualified path, or, for systems that support separate
             LD_PRELOAD environment variables for 32-bit and 64-bit
             executables, it may optionally be set to two fully-
             qualified paths separated by a colon (‘:’).  The first path
             should be the 32-bit version and the second the 64-bit
             version.  This two-path form is currently only supported on
             AIX and Solaris systems.  The default value is
             <i>/usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudo_noexec.so</i>.

       plugin_dir
             The default directory to use when searching for plugins
             that are specified without a fully qualified path name.
             The default value is <i>/usr/local/libexec/sudo</i>.

   <b>Other settings</b>
       The <b>sudo.conf </b>file also supports the following front-end
       settings:

       disable_coredump
             Core dumps of <b>sudo </b>itself are disabled by default to
             prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive
             information.  To aid in debugging <b>sudo </b>crashes, you may
             wish to re-enable core dumps by setting “disable_coredump”
             to false in <b>sudo.conf </b>as follows:

                 Set disable_coredump false

             All modern operating systems place restrictions on core
             dumps from set-user-ID processes like <b>sudo </b>so this option
             can be enabled without compromising security.  To actually
             get a <b>sudo </b>core file you will likely need to enable core
             dumps for set-user-ID processes.  On BSD and Linux systems
             this is accomplished in the <i>sysctl</i>(8) command.  On Solaris,
             the <i>coreadm</i>(1m) command is used to configure core dump
             behavior.

             This setting is only available in <b>sudo </b>version 1.8.4 and
             higher.

       group_source
             <b>sudo </b>passes the invoking user's group list to the policy
             and I/O plugins.  On most systems, there is an upper limit
             to the number of groups that a user may belong to
             simultaneously (typically 16 for compatibility with NFS).
             On systems with the <i>getconf</i>(1) utility, running:
                   <b>getconf NGROUPS_MAX</b>
             will return the maximum number of groups.

             However, it is still possible to be a member of a larger
             number of groups--they simply won't be included in the
             group list returned by the kernel for the user.  Starting
             with <b>sudo </b>version 1.8.7, if the user's kernel group list
             has the maximum number of entries, <b>sudo </b>will consult the
             group database directly to determine the group list.  This
             makes it possible for the security policy to perform
             matching by group name even when the user is a member of
             more than the maximum number of groups.

             The <i>group_source</i> setting allows the administrator to change
             this default behavior.  Supported values for <i>group_source</i>
             are:

             static
                   Use the static group list that the kernel returns.
                   Retrieving the group list this way is very fast but
                   it is subject to an upper limit as described above.
                   It is “static” in that it does not reflect changes to
                   the group database made after the user logs in.  This
                   was the default behavior prior to <b>sudo </b>1.8.7.

             dynamic
                   Always query the group database directly.  It is
                   “dynamic” in that changes made to the group database
                   after the user logs in will be reflected in the group
                   list.  On some systems, querying the group database
                   for all of a user's groups can be time consuming when
                   querying a network-based group database.  Most
                   operating systems provide an efficient method of
                   performing such queries.  Currently, <b>sudo </b>supports
                   efficient group queries on AIX, BSD, Linux, macOS,
                   and Solaris.  This is the default behavior on macOS
                   in <b>sudo </b>1.9.6 and higher.

             adaptive
                   Only query the group database if the static group
                   list returned by the kernel has the maximum number of
                   entries.  This is the default behavior on systems
                   other than macOS in <b>sudo </b>1.8.7 and higher.

             For example, to cause <b>sudo </b>to only use the kernel's static
             list of groups for the user:

                 Set group_source static

             This setting is only available in <b>sudo </b>version 1.8.7 and
             higher.

       max_groups
             The maximum number of user groups to retrieve from the
             group database.  Values less than one or larger than 1024
             will be ignored.  This setting is only used when querying
             the group database directly.  It is intended to be used on
             systems where it is not possible to detect when the array
             to be populated with group entries is not sufficiently
             large.  By default, <b>sudo </b>will allocate four times the
             system's maximum number of groups (see above) and retry
             with double that number if the group database query fails.

             This setting is only available in <b>sudo </b>version 1.8.7 and
             higher.  It should not be required in <b>sudo </b>versions 1.8.24
             and higher and may be removed in a later release.

       probe_interfaces
             By default, <b>sudo </b>will probe the system's network interfaces
             and pass the IP address of each enabled interface to the
             policy plugin.  This makes it possible for the plugin to
             match rules based on the IP address without having to query
             DNS.  On Linux systems with a large number of virtual
             interfaces, this may take a non-negligible amount of time.
             If IP-based matching is not required, network interface
             probing can be disabled as follows:

                 Set probe_interfaces false

             This setting is only available in <b>sudo </b>version 1.8.10 and
             higher.

   <b>Debug settings</b>
       <b>sudo </b>versions 1.8.4 and higher support a flexible debugging
       framework that can log what <b>sudo </b>is doing internally if there is
       a problem.

       A <i>Debug</i> line consists of the <i>Debug</i> keyword, followed by the name
       of the program, plugin, or shared object to debug, the debug file
       name, and a comma-separated list of debug flags.  The debug flag
       syntax used by <b>sudo</b>, the <b>sudoers </b>plugin along with its associated
       programs and shared objects is <i>subsystem</i>@<i>priority</i> but a third-
       party plugin is free to use a different format so long as it does
       not include a comma (‘,’).

       On AIX systems, a <i>Debug</i> line will match a plugin specified as
       either the name of an SVR4-style shared object file ending in
       ‘.so’, an archive file ending in ‘.a’, or an archive file ending
       in ‘.a’ with the name of the shared object in parentheses.

       Examples:

           Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug all@warn,plugin@info

       would log all debugging statements at the <i>warn</i> level and higher
       in addition to those at the <i>info</i> level for the plugin subsystem.

           Debug sudo_intercept.so /var/log/intercept_debug all@debug

       would log all debugging statements, regardless of level, for the
       <i>sudo_intercept.so</i> shared library that implements <b>sudo</b>'s intercept
       functionality on some systems.

           Debug sudoers.so /var/log/sudoers_debug all@debug

       would log all debugging statements, regardless of level, for the
       <b>sudoers </b>plugin.  See <i>sudoers</i>(5) for the full list of subsystems
       supported by the <b>sudoers </b>plugin.

       As of <b>sudo </b>1.8.12, multiple <i>Debug</i> entries may be specified per
       program.  Older versions of <b>sudo </b>only support a single <i>Debug</i>
       entry per program.  Plugin-specific <i>Debug</i> entries are also
       supported starting with <b>sudo </b>1.8.12 and are matched by either the
       base name of the plugin that was loaded (for example <i>sudoers.so</i>)
       or by the plugin's fully-qualified path name.  Previously, the
       <b>sudoers </b>plugin shared the same <i>Debug</i> entry as the <b>sudo </b>front-end
       and could not be configured separately.

       The following priorities are supported, in order of decreasing
       severity: <i>crit</i>, <i>err</i>, <i>warn</i>, <i>notice</i>, <i>diag</i>, <i>info</i>, <i>trace</i>, and <i>debug</i>.
       Each priority, when specified, also includes all priorities
       higher than it.  For example, a priority of <i>notice</i> would include
       debug messages logged at <i>notice</i> and higher.

       The priorities <i>trace</i> and <i>debug</i> also include function call tracing
       which logs when a function is entered and when it returns.  For
       example, the following trace is for the <b>get_user_groups</b>()
       function located in src/sudo.c:

           sudo[123] -&gt; get_user_groups @ src/sudo.c:385
           sudo[123] &lt;- get_user_groups @ src/sudo.c:429 := groups=10,0,5

       When the function is entered, indicated by a right arrow ‘-&gt;’,
       the program, process ID, function, source file, and line number
       are logged.  When the function returns, indicated by a left arrow
       ‘&lt;-’, the same information is logged along with the return value.
       In this case, the return value is a string.

       The following subsystems are used by the <b>sudo </b>front-end:

       <i>all</i>         matches every subsystem

       <i>args</i>        command line argument processing

       <i>conv</i>        user conversation

       <i>edit</i>        sudoedit

       <i>event</i>       event subsystem

       <i>exec</i>        command execution

       <i>main</i>        <b>sudo </b>main function

       <i>netif</i>       network interface handling

       <i>pcomm</i>       communication with the plugin

       <i>plugin</i>      plugin configuration

       <i>pty</i>         pseudo-terminal related code

       <i>selinux</i>     SELinux-specific handling

       <i>util</i>        utility functions

       <i>utmp</i>        utmp handling

       The <i>sudoers</i>(5) plugin includes support for additional subsystems.

       # Sudo askpass:
       #   Path askpass /path/to/askpass
       #
       # An askpass helper program may be specified to provide a graphical
       # password prompt for "sudo -A" support.  Sudo does not ship with its
       # own askpass program but can use the OpenSSH askpass.
       #
       # Use the OpenSSH askpass
       #Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass
       #
       # Use the Gnome OpenSSH askpass
       #Path askpass /usr/libexec/openssh/gnome-ssh-askpass

       #
       # Sudo device search path:
       #   Path devsearch /dev/path1:/dev/path2:/dev
       #
       # A colon-separated list of paths to check when searching for a user's
       # terminal device.

       #
       # Sudo command interception:
       #   Path intercept /path/to/sudo_intercept.so
       #
       # Path to a shared library containing replacements for the execv()
       # and execve() library functions that perform a policy check to verify
       # the command is allowed and simply return an error if not.  This is
       # used to implement the "intercept" functionality on systems that
       # support LD_PRELOAD or its equivalent.
       #
       # The compiled-in value is usually sufficient and should only be changed
       # if you rename or move the sudo_intercept.so file.
       #
       #Path intercept /usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so

       #
       # Sudo noexec:
       #   Path noexec /path/to/sudo_noexec.so
       #
       # Path to a shared library containing replacements for the execv()
       # family of library functions that just return an error.  This is
       # used to implement the "noexec" functionality on systems that support
       # LD_PRELOAD or its equivalent.
       #
       # The compiled-in value is usually sufficient and should only be changed
       # if you rename or move the sudo_noexec.so file.
       #
       #Path noexec /usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudo_noexec.so

       #
       # Sudo plugin directory:
       #   Path plugin_dir /path/to/plugins
       #
       # The default directory to use when searching for plugins that are
       # specified without a fully qualified path name.
       #
       #Path plugin_dir /usr/local/libexec/sudo

       #
       # Core dumps:
       #   Set disable_coredump true|false
       #
       # By default, sudo disables core dumps while it is executing (they
       # are re-enabled for the command that is run).
       # To aid in debugging sudo problems, you may wish to enable core
       # dumps by setting "disable_coredump" to false.
       #
       #Set disable_coredump false

       #
       # User groups:
       #   Set group_source static|dynamic|adaptive
       #
       # Sudo passes the user's group list to the policy plugin.
       # If the user is a member of the maximum number of groups (usually 16),
       # sudo will query the group database directly to be sure to include
       # the full list of groups.
       #
       # On some systems, this can be expensive so the behavior is configurable.
       # The "group_source" setting has three possible values:
       #   static   - use the user's list of groups returned by the kernel.
       #   dynamic  - query the group database to find the list of groups.
       #   adaptive - if user is in less than the maximum number of groups.
       #              use the kernel list, else query the group database.
       #
       #Set group_source static

       #
       # Sudo interface probing:
       #   Set probe_interfaces true|false
       #
       # By default, sudo will probe the system's network interfaces and
       # pass the IP address of each enabled interface to the policy plugin.
       # On systems with a large number of virtual interfaces this may take
       # a noticeable amount of time.
       #
       #Set probe_interfaces false

       #
       # Sudo debug files:
       #   Debug program /path/to/debug_log subsystem@priority[,subsyste@priority]
       #
       # Sudo and related programs support logging debug information to a file.
       # The program is typically sudo, sudoers.so, sudoreplay, or visudo.
       #
       # Subsystems vary based on the program; "all" matches all subsystems.
       # Priority may be crit, err, warn, notice, diag, info, trace, or debug.
       # Multiple subsystem@priority may be specified, separated by a comma.
       #
       #Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug all@debug
       #Debug sudoers.so /var/log/sudoers_debug all@debug
