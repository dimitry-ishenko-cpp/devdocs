NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="pkgtorrent-service.conf.5.html">pkgtorrent-service.conf(5)</a> is an example Apache 2 configuration
       file for the <a href="../man8/pkgtorrent-service.8.html">pkgtorrent-service(8)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       The default configuration maps the name <b>torrent_service </b>in any
       "subdirectory" of the web server root to the WSGI program.  The
       service cannot be installed in web server root because all multi-
       file torrents contain a concept of a name, which is expanded to a
       directory name when unpacked.  The service generates .torrent
       files which populates the <b>url-list </b>metadata with the URL prefix
       to the <b>torrent_service </b>name. All files within the torrent are
       relative to this prefix.  The <a href="../man8/pkgtorrent-service.8.html">pkgtorrent-service(8)</a> has been
       tested extensively with Apache 2 and mod_wsgi, but should work
       equally well with any other WSGI capable web server.

       To use this configuration with Apache 2, install and enable
       <b>mod_wsgi </b>then enable this "site" using:

              <b>a2ensite pkgtorrent-service.conf</b>
