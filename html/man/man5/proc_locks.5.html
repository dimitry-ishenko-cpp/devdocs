       /proc/locks - current file locks and leases

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc/locks</i>
              This file shows current file locks (<a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>)
              and leases (<a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>).

              An example of the content shown in this file is the
              following:

                  1: POSIX  ADVISORY  READ  5433 08:01:7864448 128 128
                  2: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 2001 08:01:7864554 0 EOF
                  3: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 1568 00:2f:32388 0 EOF
                  4: POSIX  ADVISORY  WRITE 699 00:16:28457 0 EOF
                  5: POSIX  ADVISORY  WRITE 764 00:16:21448 0 0
                  6: POSIX  ADVISORY  READ  3548 08:01:7867240 1 1
                  7: POSIX  ADVISORY  READ  3548 08:01:7865567 1826 2335
                  8: OFDLCK ADVISORY  WRITE -1 08:01:8713209 128 191

              The fields shown in each line are as follows:

              [1]  The ordinal position of the lock in the list.

              [2]  The lock type.  Values that may appear here include:

                   <b>FLOCK  </b>This is a BSD file lock created using
                          <a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock(2)</a>.

                   <b>OFDLCK </b>This is an open file description (OFD) lock
                          created using <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

                   <b>POSIX  </b>This is a POSIX byte-range lock created using
                          <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

              [3]  Among the strings that can appear here are the
                   following:

                   <b>ADVISORY</b>
                          This is an advisory lock.

                   <b>MANDATORY</b>
                          This is a mandatory lock.

              [4]  The type of lock.  Values that can appear here are:

                   <b>READ   </b>This is a POSIX or OFD read lock, or a BSD
                          shared lock.

                   <b>WRITE  </b>This is a POSIX or OFD write lock, or a BSD
                          exclusive lock.

              [5]  The PID of the process that owns the lock.

                   Because OFD locks are not owned by a single process
                   (since multiple processes may have file descriptors
                   that refer to the same open file description), the
                   value -1 is displayed in this field for OFD locks.
                   (Before Linux 4.14, a bug meant that the PID of the
                   process that initially acquired the lock was
                   displayed instead of the value -1.)

              [6]  Three colon-separated subfields that identify the
                   major and minor device ID of the device containing
                   the filesystem where the locked file resides,
                   followed by the inode number of the locked file.

              [7]  The byte offset of the first byte of the lock.  For
                   BSD locks, this value is always 0.

              [8]  The byte offset of the last byte of the lock.  <b>EOF </b>in
                   this field means that the lock extends to the end of
                   the file.  For BSD locks, the value shown is always
                   <i>EOF</i>.

              Since Linux 4.9, the list of locks shown in <i>/proc/locks</i> is
              filtered to show just the locks for the processes in the
              PID namespace (see <a href="../man7/pid_namespaces.7.html">pid_namespaces(7)</a>) for which the <i>/proc</i>
              filesystem was mounted.  (In the initial PID namespace,
              there is no filtering of the records shown in this file.)

              The <a href="../man8/lslocks.8.html">lslocks(8)</a> command provides a bit more information
              about each lock.
