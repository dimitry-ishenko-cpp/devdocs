</pre> <h2>
INTRODUCTION </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="../man8/systemd-machined.service.8.html">systemd-machined.service(8)</a> is a system service that keeps track
       of locally running virtual machines and containers. This page
       describes the D-Bus interface.

THE MANAGER OBJECT </h2>
<pre>
       The service exposes the following interfaces on the Manager
       object on the bus:

   <b>Methods</b>
       <b>GetMachine() </b>may be used to get the machine object path for the
       machine with the specified name. Similarly, <b>GetMachineByPID()</b>
       gets the machine object the specified PID belongs to if there is
       any.

       <b>GetImage() </b>may be used to get the image object path of the image
       with the specified name.

       <b>ListMachines() </b>returns an array of all currently registered
       machines. The structures in the array consist of the following
       fields: machine name, machine class, an identifier for the
       service that registered the machine and the machine object path.

       <b>ListImages() </b>returns an array of all currently known images. The
       structures in the array consist of the following fields: image
       name, type, read-only flag, creation time, modification time,
       current disk space, and image object path.

       <b>CreateMachine() </b>may be used to register a new virtual machine or
       container with <b>systemd-machined</b>, creating a scope unit for it. It
       accepts the following arguments: a machine name chosen by the
       registrar, an optional UUID as a 32 byte array, a string that
       identifies the service that registers the machine, a class
       string, the PID of the leader process of the machine, an optional
       root directory of the container, and an array of additional
       properties to use for the scope registration. The virtual machine
       name must be suitable as a hostname, and hence should follow the
       usual DNS hostname rules, as well as the Linux hostname
       restrictions. Specifically, only 7 bit ASCII is permitted, a
       maximum length of 64 characters is enforced, only characters from
       the set "a-zA-Z0-9-_."  are allowed, the name may not begin with
       a dot, and it may not contain two dots immediately following each
       other. Container and VM managers should ideally use the hostname
       used internally in the machine for this parameter. This
       recommendation is made in order to make the machine name
       naturally resolvable using <a href="../man8/nss-mymachines.8.html">nss-mymachines(8)</a>. If a container
       manager needs to embed characters outside of the indicated range,
       escaping is required, possibly using "_" as the escape character.
       Another (somewhat natural) option would be to utilize Internet
       IDNA encoding. The UUID is passed as a 32 byte array or, if no
       suitable UUID is available, an empty array (zero length) or
       zeroed out array shall be passed. The UUID should identify the
       virtual machine/container uniquely and should ideally be the same
       UUID that /etc/machine-id in the VM/container is initialized
       from. The service string can be free-form, but it is recommended
       to pass a short lowercase identifier like "systemd-nspawn",
       "libvirt-lxc" or similar. The class string should be either
       "container" or "vm" indicating whether the machine to register is
       of the respective class. The leader PID should be the host PID of
       the init process of the container or the encapsulating process of
       the VM. If the root directory of the container is known and
       available in the host's hierarchy, it should be passed.
       Otherwise, pass the empty string instead. Finally, the scope
       properties are passed as array in the same way as to PID1's
       <b>StartTransientUnit() </b>method. Calling this method will internally
       register a transient scope unit for the calling client (utilizing
       the passed scope_properties) and move the leader PID into it. The
       method returns an object path for the registered machine object
       that implements the org.freedesktop.machine1.Machine interface
       (see below). Also see the <b>New Control Group Interfaces</b>[1] for
       details about scope units and how to alter resource control
       settings on the created machine at runtime.

       <b>RegisterMachine() </b>is similar to <b>CreateMachine()</b>. However, it only
       registers a machine and does not create a scope unit for it.
       Instead, the caller's unit is registered. We recommend to only
       use this method for container or VM managers that are run
       multiple times, one instance for each container/VM they manage,
       and are invoked as system services.

       <b>CreateMachineWithNetwork() </b>and <b>RegisterMachineWithNetwork() </b>are
       similar to <b>CreateMachine() </b>and <b>RegisterMachine() </b>but take an
       extra argument: an array of network interface indices that point
       towards the virtual machine or container. The interface indices
       should reference one or more network interfaces on the host that
       can be used to communicate with the guest. Commonly, the passed
       interface index refers to the host side of a "veth" link (in case
       of containers), a "tun"/"tap" link (in case of VMs), or the host
       side of a bridge interface that bridges access to the
       VM/container interfaces. Specifying this information is useful to
       enable support for link-local IPv6 communication to the machines
       since the scope field of sockaddr_in6 can be initialized by the
       specified ifindex.  <a href="../man8/nss-mymachines.8.html">nss-mymachines(8)</a> makes use of this
       information.

       <b>KillMachine() </b>sends a UNIX signal to the machine's processes. As
       its arguments, it takes a machine name (as originally passed to
       <b>CreateMachine() </b>or returned by <b>ListMachines()</b>), an identifier
       that specifies what precisely to send the signal to (either
       "leader" or "all"), and a numeric UNIX signal integer.

       <b>TerminateMachine() </b>terminates a virtual machine, killing its
       processes. It takes a machine name as its only argument.

       <b>GetMachineAddresses() </b>retrieves the IP addresses of a container.
       This method returns an array of pairs consisting of an address
       family specifier (<b>AF_INET </b>or <b>AF_INET6</b>) and a byte array
       containing the addresses. This is only supported for containers
       that make use of network namespacing.

       <b>GetMachineSSHInfo() </b>retrieves the SSH information of a machine.
       This method returns two strings, the SSH address which can be
       used to tell SSH where to connect, and the path to the SSH
       private key required for the connection to succeed.

       <b>GetMachineOSRelease() </b>retrieves the OS release information of a
       container. This method returns an array of key value pairs read
       from the <a href="os-release.5.html">os-release(5)</a> file in the container and is useful to
       identify the operating system used in a container.

       <b>OpenMachinePTY() </b>allocates a pseudo TTY in the container and
       returns a file descriptor and its path. This is equivalent to
       transitioning into the container and invoking <a href="../man3/posix_openpt.3.html">posix_openpt(3)</a>.

       <b>OpenMachineLogin() </b>allocates a pseudo TTY in the container and
       ensures that a getty login prompt of the container is running on
       the other end. It returns the file descriptor of the PTY and the
       PTY path. This is useful for acquiring a pty with a login prompt
       from the container.

       <b>OpenMachineShell() </b>allocates a pseudo TTY in the container, as
       the specified user, and invokes the executable at the specified
       path with a list of arguments (starting from argv[0]) and an
       environment block. It then returns the file descriptor of the PTY
       and the PTY path.

       <b>BindMountMachine() </b>bind mounts a file or directory from the host
       into the container. Its arguments consist of a machine name, the
       source directory on the host, the destination directory in the
       container, and two booleans, one indicating whether the bind
       mount shall be read-only, the other indicating whether the
       destination mount point shall be created first, if it is missing.

       <b>CopyFromMachine() </b>copies files or directories from a container
       into the host. It takes a container name, a source directory in
       the container and a destination directory on the host as
       arguments.  <b>CopyToMachine() </b>does the opposite and copies files
       from a source directory on the host into a destination directory
       in the container.  <b>CopyFromMachineWithFlags() </b>and
       <b>CopyToMachineWithFlags() </b>do the same but take an additional flags
       argument.

       <b>RemoveImage() </b>removes the image with the specified name.

       <b>RenameImage() </b>renames the specified image.

       <b>CloneImage() </b>clones the specified image under a new name. It also
       takes a boolean argument indicating whether the resulting image
       shall be read-only or not.

       <b>MarkImageReadOnly() </b>toggles the read-only flag of an image.

       <b>SetPoolLimit() </b>sets an overall quota limit on the pool of images.

       <b>SetImageLimit() </b>sets a per-image quota limit.

       <b>MapFromMachineUser()</b>, <b>MapToMachineUser()</b>, <b>MapFromMachineGroup()</b>,
       and <b>MapToMachineGroup() </b>may be used to map UIDs/GIDs from the
       host user namespace to a container user namespace or vice versa.

   <b>Signals</b>
       <b>MachineNew() </b>and <b>MachineRemoved() </b>are sent whenever a new machine
       is registered or removed. These signals carry the machine name
       and the object path to the corresponding
       org.freedesktop.machine1.Machine interface (see below).

   <b>Properties</b>
       <i>PoolPath</i> specifies the file system path where images are written
       to.

       <i>PoolUsage</i> specifies the current usage size of the image pool in
       bytes.

       <i>PoolLimit</i> specifies the size limit of the image pool in bytes.

   <b>Methods</b>
       <b>Terminate() </b>and <b>Kill() </b>terminate/kill the machine. These methods
       take the same arguments as <b>TerminateMachine() </b>and <b>KillMachine()</b>
       on the Manager interface, respectively.

       <b>GetAddresses()</b>, <b>GetSSHInfo() </b>and <b>GetOSRelease() </b>get the IP
       address, SSH connection and OS release information from the
       machine. These methods take the same arguments as
       <b>GetMachineAddresses()</b>, <b>GetMachineSSHInfo() </b>and
       <b>GetMachineOSRelease() </b>of the Manager interface, respectively.

   <b>Properties</b>
       <i>Name</i> is the machine name as it was passed in during registration
       with <b>CreateMachine() </b>on the manager object.

       <i>Id</i> is the machine UUID.

       <i>Timestamp</i> and <i>TimestampMonotonic</i> are the realtime and monotonic
       timestamps when the virtual machines where created in
       microseconds since the epoch.

       <i>Service</i> contains a short string identifying the registering
       service as passed in during registration of the machine.

       <i>Unit</i> is the systemd scope or service unit name for the machine.

       <i>Leader</i> is the PID of the leader process of the machine.

       <i>Class</i> is the class of the machine and is either the string "vm"
       (for real VMs based on virtualized hardware) or "container" (for
       light-weight userspace virtualization sharing the same kernel as
       the host).

       <i>RootDirectory</i> is the root directory of the container if it is
       known and applicable or the empty string.

       <i>NetworkInterfaces</i> contains an array of network interface indices
       that point towards the container, the VM or the host. For details
       about this information see the description of
       <b>CreateMachineWithNetwork() </b>above.

       <i>VSockCID</i> is the VSOCK CID of the VM if it is known, or
       <b>VMADDR_CID_ANY </b>otherwise.

       <i>SSHAddress</i> is the address of the VM in a format <b>ssh </b>can
       understand if it is known or the empty string.

       <i>SSHPrivateKeyPath</i> is the path to the SSH private key of the VM if
       it is known or the empty string.

       <i>State</i> is the state of the machine and is one of "opening",
       "running", or "closing". Note that the state machine is not
       considered part of the API and states might be removed or added
       without this being considered API breakage.
