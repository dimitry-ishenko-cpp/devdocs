Name </h2>
<pre>
       groff_trace - macros for debugging GNU <i>roff</i> documents
</pre> <h2>
Synopsis </h2>
<pre>
       <b>groff -m trace </b>[<i>option</i> ...] [<i>file</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
Description </h2>
<pre>
       <i>trace</i> is a macro package for the <i>groff</i>(7) document formatting
       system, designed as an aid for debugging documents written in its
       language.  It issues a message to the standard error stream upon
       entry to and exit from each macro call.  This can ease the
       process of isolating errors in macro definitions.

       Activate the package by specifying the command-line option
       “<b>-m trace</b>” to the formatter program (often <i>groff</i>(1)).  You can
       achieve finer control by including the macro file within the
       document; invoke the <b>mso </b>request, as in “<b>.mso trace.tmac</b>”.  Only
       macros that are defined after this invocation are traced.  If the
       <b>trace-full </b>register is set to a true value, as with the command-
       line option “<b>-r trace-full=1</b>”, register and string assignments,
       along with some other requests, are traced also.  If another
       macro package should be traced as well, specify it after
       “<b>-m trace</b>” on the command line.

       The macro file <i>trace.tmac</i> is unusual because it does not contain
       any macros to be called by a user.  Instead, <i>groff</i>'s macro
       definition and alteration facilities are wrapped such that they
       display diagnostic messages.

   <b>Limitations</b>
       Because <i>trace.tmac</i> wraps the <b>de </b>request (and its cousins), macro
       arguments are expanded one level more.  This causes problems if
       an argument uses four or more backslashes to delay interpretation
       of an escape sequence.  For example, the macro call
              .foo \\\\n[bar]
       normally passes “\\n[bar]” to macro “foo”, but with <b>de </b>redefined,
       it passes “\n[bar]” instead.

       The solution to this problem is to use <i>groff</i>'s <b>\E </b>escape
       sequence, an escape character that is not interpreted in copy
       mode.
              .foo \En[bar]
</pre> <h2>
Examples </h2>
<pre>
       We will illustrate <i>trace.tmac</i> using the shell's “here document”
       feature to supply <i>groff</i> with a document on the standard input
       stream.  Since we are interested only in diagnostic messages
       appearing on the standard error stream, we discard the formatted
       output by redirecting the standard output stream to <i>/dev/null</i>.

   <b>Observing nested macro calls</b>
       Macro calls can be nested, even with themselves.  Tracing
       recurses along with them; this feature can help to detangle
       complex call stacks.

              $ <b>cat &lt;&lt;EOF | groff -m trace &gt; /dev/null</b>
              <b>.de countdown</b>
              <b>. nop \\$1</b>
              <b>. nr count (\\$1 - 1)</b>
              <b>. if \\n[count] .countdown \\n[count]</b>
              <b>..</b>
              <b>.countdown 3</b>
              <b>blastoff</b>
              <b>EOF</b>
               *** .de countdown
               *** de trace enter: .countdown "3"
                *** de trace enter: .countdown "2"
                 *** de trace enter: .countdown "1"
                 *** trace exit: .countdown "1"
                *** trace exit: .countdown "2"
               *** trace exit: .countdown "3"

   <b>Tracing with the mso request</b>
       Now let us activate tracing within the document, not with a
       command-line option.  We might do so when employing a macro
       package like <i>ms</i> or <i>mom</i>, to avoid distraction by traces of macros
       we didn't write.

              $ <b>cat &lt;&lt;EOF | groff -ms &gt; /dev/null</b>
              <b>.LP</b>
              <b>This is my introductory paragraph.</b>
              <b>.mso trace.tmac</b>
              <b>.de Mymac</b>
              <b>..</b>
              <b>.Mymac</b>
              <b>.PP</b>
              <b>Let us review the existing literature.</b>
              <b>EOF</b>
               *** .de Mymac
               *** de trace enter: .Mymac
               *** trace exit: .Mymac

       As tracing was not yet active when the macros “LP” and “PP” were
       defined (by <i>s.tmac</i>), their calls were not traced; contrast with
       the macro “Mymac”.
