Description </h2>
<pre>
       The name <i>ditroff</i> refers to a historical development stage of the
       <i>roff</i>(7) text processing system.  In <i>roff</i> systems extant today,
       the name <i>troff</i> is a synonym for <i>ditroff</i>.

       Early versions of <i>roff</i> by Joe Ossanna generated two programs from
       the same sources, using conditional compilation to distinguish
       them.  <i>nroff</i> produced text-oriented TTY output, while <i>troff</i>
       generated graphical output for exactly one output device, the
       Wang Graphic Systems CAT phototypesetter.

       In 1979, Brian Kernighan rewrote <i>troff</i> to support more devices by
       creating an intermediate output format for <i>troff</i> that could be
       fed into postprocessor programs which actually do the printout on
       the device.  Kernighan's version marks what is known as
       “classical troff” today.  In order to distinguish it from
       Ossanna's original version, it was called <i>ditroff</i> (<i>d</i>evice
       <i>i</i>ndependent <i>t</i>roff) on some systems, though this naming isn't
       mentioned in the classical documentation.

       Today, all existing <i>roff</i> systems are based on Kernighan's multi-
       device <i>troff</i>.  The distinction between <i>troff</i> and <i>ditroff</i> is no
       longer necessary; each modern <i>troff</i> provides the complete
       functionality of <i>ditroff</i>.

       The easiest way to use <i>ditroff</i> is via the GNU <i>roff</i> system, <i>groff</i>.
       The <i>groff</i>(1) program is a wrapper around <i>(di)troff</i> that
       automatically handles device postprocessing.
