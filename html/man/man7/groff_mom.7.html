Description </h2>
<pre>
       <i>mom</i> is a macro set for <i>groff</i>, designed primarily to prepare
       documents for PDF and PostScript output.  <i>mom</i> provides macros in
       two categories: typesetting and document processing.  The former
       provide access to <i>groff</i>'s typesetting capabilities in ways that
       are simpler to master than <i>groff</i>'s requests and escape sequences.
       The latter provide highly customizable markup tags that allow the
       user to design and output professional-looking documents with a
       minimum of typesetting intervention.

       Files processed with <i>pdfmom</i>(1) produce PDF documents.  The
       documents include a PDF outline that appears in the navigation
       pane panel of document viewers, and may contain clickable
       internal and external links.

       Normally.  <i>groff</i>'s native PDF driver, <i>gropdf</i>(1), is used to
       generate the output.  When <i>pdfmom</i> is given the “<b>-T ps</b>” option, it
       still produces PDF, but processing is delegated to <i>pdfroff</i>, which
       uses <i>groff</i>'s PostScript driver, <i>grops</i>(1).  Not all PDF features
       are available when <b>-T ps </b>is given; its primary use is to allow
       processing of files with embedded PostScript images.

       Files processed with <b>groff -mom </b>(or <b>-m mom</b>) format for the device
       specified with the <b>-T </b>option.  (In this installation, <b>ps </b>is the
       default output device.)

       <i>mom</i> comes with her own comprehensive documentation in HTML.  A
       PDF manual, “Producing PDFs with <i>groff</i> and <i>mom</i>”, discusses
       preparation of PDF documents with <i>mom</i> in detail.

   <b>Details of inline escape sequences in alphabetical order</b>
       <b>\*[</b><i>&lt;colorname&gt;</i><b>]</b>
              begin using an initialized colour inline

       <b>\*[BCK </b><i>n</i><b>]</b>
              move backward in a line

       <b>\*[BOLDER]</b>
       <b>\*[BOLDERX]</b>
              Emboldening on/off

              <b>\*[BOLDER] </b>begins emboldening type.  <b>\*[BOLDERX] </b>turns the
              feature off.  Both are inline escape sequences; therefore,
              they should not appear as separate lines, but rather be
              embedded in text lines, like this:
                     Not <b>\*[BOLDER]</b>everything<b>\*[BOLDERX] </b>is as it seems.

              Alternatively, if you wanted the whole line emboldened,
              you should do
                     <b>\*[BOLDER]</b>Not everything is as it seems.<b>\*[BOLDERX]</b>
              Once <b>\*[BOLDER] </b>is invoked, it remains in effect until
              turned off.

              Note: If you're using the document processing macros with
              <b>.PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE</b>, <i>mom</i> ignores <b>\*[BOLDER] </b>requests.

       <b>\*[BU </b><i>n</i><b>]</b>
              move characters pairs closer together inline (related to
              macro <b>.KERN</b>)

       <b>\*[COND]</b>
       <b>\*[CONDX]</b>
              Pseudo-condensing on/off

              <b>\*[COND] </b>begins pseudo-condensing type.  <b>\*[CONDX] </b>turns
              the feature off.  Both are inline escape sequences;
              therefore, they should not appear as separate lines, but
              rather be embedded in text lines, like this:
                     <b>\*[COND]</b><i>Not everything is as it seems.</i><b>\*[CONDX]</b>
              <b>\*[COND] </b>remains in effect until you turn it off with
              <b>\*[CONDX]</b>.

              IMPORTANT: You must turn <b>\*[COND] </b>off before making any
              changes to the point size of your type, either via the
              <b>.PT_SIZE </b>macro or with the <b>\s </b>inline escape sequence.  If
              you wish the new point size to be pseudo-condensed, simply
              reinvoke <b>\*[COND] </b>afterward.  Equally, <b>\*[COND] </b>must be
              turned off before changing the condense percentage with
              <b>.CONDENSE</b>.

              Note: If you're using the document processing macros with
              <b>.PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE</b>, <i>mom</i> ignores <b>\*[COND] </b>requests.

       <b>\*[EXT]</b>
       <b>\*[EXTX]</b>
              Pseudo-extending on/off

              <b>\*[EXT] </b>begins pseudo-extending type.  <b>\*[EXTX] </b>turns the
              feature off.  Both are inline escape sequences; therefore,
              they should not appear as separate lines, but rather be
              embedded in text lines, like this:
                     <b>\*[EXT]</b><i>Not everything is as it seems.</i><b>\*[EXTX]</b>
              <b>\*[EXT] </b>remains in effect until you turn it off with
              <b>\*[EXTX]</b>.

              IMPORTANT: You must turn <b>\*[EXT] </b>off before making any
              changes to the point size of your type, either via the
              <b>.PT_SIZE </b>macro or with the <b>\s </b>inline escape sequence.  If
              you wish the new point size to be <i>pseudo-extended</i>, simply
              reinvoke <b>\*[EXT] </b>afterward.  Equally, <b>\*[EXT] </b>must be

       <b>\*[SLANT]</b>
       <b>\*[SLANTX]</b>
              Pseudo italic on/off

              <b>\*[SLANT] </b>begins <i>pseudo-italicizing type</i>.  <b>\*[SLANTX]</b>
              turns the feature off.  Both are inline escape sequences;
              therefore, they should not appear as separate lines, but
              rather be embedded in text lines, like this:
                     Not <b>\*[SLANT]</b>everything<b>\*[SLANTX] </b>is as it seems.

              Alternatively, if you wanted the whole line <i>pseudo-</i>
              <i>italicized</i>, you'd do
                     <b>\*[SLANT]</b>Not everything is as it seems.<b>\*[SLANTX]</b>

              Once <b>\*[SLANT] </b>is invoked, it remains in effect until
              turned off.

              Note: If you're using the document processing macros with
              <b>.PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE</b>, <i>mom</i> underlines pseudo-italics by
              default.  To change this behaviour, use the special macro
              <b>.SLANT_MEANS_SLANT</b>.

       <b>\*[ST</b><i>&lt;number&gt;</i><b>]</b>...<b>\*[ST</b><i>&lt;number&gt;</i><b>X]</b>
              Mark positions of string tabs

              The <i>quad</i> direction must be <b>LEFT </b>or <b>JUSTIFY </b>(see <b>.QUAD </b>and
              <b>.JUSTIFY</b>) or the <i>no-fill mode</i> set to <b>LEFT </b>in order for
              these inlines to function properly.  Please see <i>IMPORTANT</i>,
              below.

              String tabs need to be marked off with inline escape
              sequences before being set up with the <b>.ST </b>macro.  Any
              input line may contain string tab markers.  <i>&lt;number&gt;</i>,
              above, means the numeric identifier of the tab.

              The following shows a sample input line with string tab
              markers.
                     <b>\*[ST1]</b>De minimus<b>\*[ST1X]</b>non curat<b>\*[ST2]</b>lex<b>\*[ST2X]</b>.

              String <i>tab 1</i> begins at the start of the line and ends
              after the word <i>time</i>.  String <i>tab 2</i> starts at <i>good</i> and ends
              after <i>men</i>.  <i>Inline escape sequences</i> (e.g., <i>font</i> or <i>point</i>
              <i>size changes</i>, or horizontal movements, including padding)
              are taken into account when <i>mom</i> determines the <i>position</i>
              and <i>length</i> of <i>string tabs</i>.

              Up to nineteen string tabs may be marked (not necessarily
              all on the same line, of course), and they must be
              numbered between 1 and 19.

              Once string tabs have been marked in input lines, they
              have to be <i>set</i> with <b>.ST</b>, after which they may be called,
              by number, with <b>.TAB</b>.

              Note: Lines with string tabs marked off in them are normal
              input lines, i.e. they get printed, just like any input
              line.  If you want to set up string tabs without the line
              printing, use the <b>.SILENT </b>macro.

              <i>IMPORTANT:</i> Owing to the way <i>groff</i> processes input lines
              and turns them into output lines, it is not possible for
              <i>mom</i> to <i>guess</i> the correct starting position of string tabs
              marked off in lines that are centered or set flush right.

              Equally, she cannot guess the starting position if a line
              is fully justified and broken with <b>.SPREAD</b>.

              In other words, in order to use string tabs, <b>LEFT </b>must be
              active, or, if <b>.QUAD LEFT </b>or <b>JUSTIFY </b>are active, the line
              on which the <i>string tabs</i> are marked must be broken
              <i>manually</i> with <b>.BR </b>(but not <b>.SPREAD</b>).

              To circumvent this behaviour, I recommend using the <b>PAD </b>to
              set up string tabs in centered or flush right lines.  Say,
              for example, you want to use a <i>string tab</i> to <i>underscore</i>
              the text of a centered line with a rule.  Rather than
              this,
                     <b>.CENTER</b>
                     <b>\*[ST1]A line of text\*[ST1X]\c</b>
                     <b>.EL</b>
                     <b>.ST 1</b>
                     <b>.TAB 1</b>
                     <b>.PT_SIZE 24</b>
                     <b>.ALD 3p</b>
                     <b>\*[RULE]</b>
                     <b>.RLD 3p</b>
                     <b>.TQ</b>
              you should do:
                     .QUAD CENTER
                     .PAD "#\*[ST1]A line of text\*[ST1X]#"

       <b>.B_MARGIN </b><i>&lt;bottom margin&gt;</i>
              Bottom Margin

              Requires a unit of measure

              <b>.B_MARGIN </b>sets a nominal position at the bottom of the
              page beyond which you don't want your type to go.  When
              the bottom margin is reached, <i>mom</i> starts a new page.
              <b>.B_MARGIN requires a unit of measure.  </b>Decimal fractions
              are allowed.  To set a nominal bottom margin of 3/4 inch,
              enter
                     <b>.B_MARGIN .75i</b>

              Obviously, if you haven't spaced the type on your pages so
              that the last lines fall perfectly at the bottom margin,
              the margin will vary from page to page.  Usually, but not
              always, the last line of type that fits on a page before
              the bottom margin causes mom to start a new page.

              Occasionally, owing to a peculiarity in <i>groff</i>, an extra
              line will fall below the nominal bottom margin.  If you're
              using the document processing macros, this is unlikely to
              happen; the document processing macros are very hard-nosed
              about aligning bottom margins.

              Note: The meaning of <b>.B_MARGIN </b>is slightly different when
              you're using the document processing macros.

       <b>.FALLBACK_FONT </b><i>&lt;fallback font&gt;</i> <b>[ ABORT | WARN ]</b>
              Fallback Font

              In the event that you pass an invalid argument to <b>.FAMILY</b>
              (i.e. a non-existent <i>family</i>), <i>mom</i>, by default, uses the
              <i>fallback font</i>, <b>Courier Medium Roman </b>(<b>CR</b>), in order to
              continue processing your file.

              If you'd prefer another <i>fallback font</i>, pass <b>.FALLBACK_FONT</b>
              the full <i>family+font name</i> of the <i>font</i> you'd like.  For
              example, if you'd rather the <i>fallback font</i> were <b>Times</b>
              <b>Roman Medium Roman</b>,
                     <b>.FALLBACK_FONT TR</b>
              would do the trick.

              <b>Mom </b>issues a warning whenever a <i>font style set</i> with <b>.FT</b>
              does not exist, either because you haven't registered the
              style or because the <i>font style</i> does not exist in the
              current <i>family set</i> with <b>.FAMILY</b>.  By default, <b>mom </b>then
              aborts, which allows you to correct the problem.

              If you'd prefer that <b>mom </b>not abort on non-existent <i>fonts</i>,
              but rather continue processing using a <i>fallback font</i>, you
              can pass <b>.FALLBACK_FONT </b>the argument <b>WARN</b>, either by
              itself, or in conjunction with your chosen <i>fallback font</i><b>.</b>

              Some examples of invoking <b>.FALLBACK_FONT</b>:

              <b>.FALLBACK_FONT WARN</b>
                     <i>mom</i> will issue a warning whenever you try to access
                     a non-existent <i>font</i> but will continue processing
                     your file with the default <i>fallback font</i>, <b>Courier</b>
                     <b>Medium Roman</b>.

              <b>.FALLBACK_FONT TR WARN</b>
                     <b>mom </b>will issue a warning whenever you try to access
                     a non-existent <i>font</i> but will continue processing
                     your file with a <i>fallback font</i> of <b>Times Roman</b>
                     <b>Medium Roman</b>; additionally, <b>TR </b>will be the <i>fallback</i>
                     <i>font</i> whenever you try to access a <i>family</i> that does
                     not exist.

              <b>.FALLBACK_FONT TR ABORT</b>
                     <b>mom </b>will abort whenever you try to access a non-
                     existent <b>font</b>, and will use the <i>fallback font</i> <b>TR</b>
                     whenever you try to access a <i>family</i> that does not
                     exist.  If, for some reason, you want to revert to
                     <b>ABORT</b>, just enter <b>".FALLBACK_FONT ABORT" </b>and <i>mom</i>
                     will once again abort on <i>font errors</i>.

       <b>.FAM </b><i>&lt;family&gt;</i>
              Type Family, alias of <b>.FAMILY</b>

       <b>.FAMILY </b><i>&lt;family&gt;</i>
              Type Family, alias of <b>.FAM</b>

              <b>.FAMILY </b>takes one argument: the name of the <i>family</i> you
              want.  <i>Groff</i> comes with a small set of basic families,
              each identified by a 1-, 2- or 3-letter mnemonic.  The
              standard families are:
                     <b>A   = Avant Garde</b>
                     <b>BM  = Bookman</b>
                     <b>H   = Helvetica</b>
                     <b>HN  = Helvetica Narrow</b>
                     <b>N   = New Century Schoolbook</b>
                     <b>P   = Palatino</b>
                     <b>T   = Times Roman</b>
                     <b>ZCM = Zapf Chancery</b>

              The argument you pass to <b>.FAMILY </b>is the identifier at
              left, above.  For example, if you want <b>Helvetica</b>, enter
                     <b>.FAMILY H</b>

              Note: The font macro (<b>.FT</b>) lets you specify both the type
              <i>family</i> and the desired font with a single macro.  While
              this saves a few keystrokes, I recommend using <b>.FAMILY for</b>
              <i>family</i>, and <b>.FT for </b><i>font</i>, except where doing so is
              genuinely inconvenient.  <b>ZCM</b>, for example, only exists in
              one style: <b>Italic </b>(<b>I</b>).

              Therefore,
                     <b>.FT ZCMI</b>
              makes more sense than setting the <i>family</i> to <b>ZCM</b>, then
              setting the <i>font</i> to <i>I</i>.

              Additional note: If you are running a <i>groff</i> version prior
              to 1.19.2, you must follow all <b>.FAMILY </b>requests with a <b>.FT</b>
              request, otherwise <i>mom</i> will set all type up to the next
              <b>.FT </b>request in the fallback font.

              If you are running <i>groff</i> 1.19.2 or later, when you invoke
              the <b>.FAMILY </b>macro, <i>mom remembers</i> the font style <b>(</b>Roman<b>,</b>
              <b>Italic</b>, etc) currently in use (if the font style exists in
              the new <i>family</i>) and will continue to use the same font
              style in the new family.  For example:
                     <b>.FAMILY BM </b><i>\" Bookman family</i>
                     <b>.FT I </b><i>\" Medium Italic</i>
                     <i>&lt;some text&gt; \" Bookman Medium Italic</i>
                     <b>.FAMILY H </b><i>\" Helvetica family</i>
                     <i>&lt;more text&gt; \" Helvetica Medium Italic</i>

              However, if the font style does not exist in the new
              family, <i>mom</i> will set all subsequent type in the fallback
              font (by default, <b>Courier Medium Roman</b>) until she
              encounters a <b>.FT </b>request that's valid for the <i>family</i>.

              For example, assuming you don't have the font <b>Medium</b>
              <b>Condensed Roman </b>(<i>mom</i> extension <i>CD</i>) in the <i>Helvetica</i>
              <i>family</i>:
                     <b>.FAMILY UN </b><i>\" Univers family</i>
                     <b>.FT CD </b><i>\" Medium Condensed</i>
                     <i>&lt;some text&gt; \" Univers Medium Condensed</i>
                     <b>.FAMILY H </b><i>\" Helvetica family</i>
                     <i>&lt;more text&gt; \" Courier Medium Roman!</i>

              In the above example, you must follow <b>.FAMILY H </b>with a <b>.FT</b>
              request that's valid for <b>Helvetica</b>.

              Please see the Appendices, <i>Adding fonts to groff</i>, for
              information on adding fonts and families to
              <i>groff</i>,<i>as</i>well<i>as</i>to see a list of the extensions <i>mom</i> provides
              to <i>groff</i>'s basic <b>R</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>BI </b>styles.

              Suggestion: When adding <i>families to groff</i>, I recommend
              following the established standard for the naming families
              and fonts.  For example, if you add the <b>Garamond </b>family,
              name the font files
                     <b>GARAMONDR</b>
                     <b>GARAMONDI</b>
                     <b>GARAMONDB</b>
                     <b>GARAMONDBI</b>
              <b>GARAMOND then becomes a valid </b><i>family name</i> you can pass to
              <b>.FAMILY</b>.  (You could, of course, shorten <b>GARAMOND </b>to just
              <b>G</b>, or <b>GD</b>.)  <b>R</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>BI </b>after <b>GARAMOND </b>are the <i>roman</i>,
              <i>italic</i>, <i>bold</i> and <i>bold-italic</i> fonts respectively.

       <b>.FONT R | B | BI | </b><i>&lt;any other valid font style&gt;</i>
              Alias to <b>.FT</b>

       <b>.FT R | B | BI | </b><i>&lt;any other valid font style&gt;</i>
              Set font

              By default, <i>groff</i> permits <b>.FT </b>to take one of four possible
              arguments specifying the desired font:
                     <b>R = (Medium) Roman</b>
                     <b>I = (Medium) Italic</b>
                     <b>B = Bold (Roman)</b>
                     <b>BI = Bold Italic</b>

              For example, if your <i>family</i> is <b>Helvetica</b>, entering
                     <b>.FT B</b>
              will give you the <i>Helvetica bold font</i>.  If your <i>family</i>
              were <b>Palatino</b>, you'd get the <i>Palatino bold font</i>.

              <b>Mom </b>considerably extends the range of arguments you can
              pass to <b>.FT</b>, making it more convenient to add and access
              fonts of differing weights and shapes within the same
              family.

              Have a look here for a list of the weight/style arguments
              <i>mom</i> allows.  Be aware, though, that you must have the
              fonts, correctly installed and named, in order to use the
              arguments.  (See <i>Adding fonts to groff</i> for instructions
              and information.)  Please also read the <i>ADDITIONAL NOTE</i>
              found in the description of the <b>.FAMILY </b>macro.

              How <i>mom</i> reacts to an invalid argument to <b>.FT </b>depends on
              which version of <i>groff</i> you're using.  If your <i>groff</i>
              version is 1.19.2 or later, <i>mom</i> will issue a warning and,
              depending on how you've set up the fallback font, either
              continue processing using the fallback font, or abort
              (allowing you to correct the problem).  In earlier
              versions, <i>mom</i> will silently continue processing, using
              either the fallback font or the font that was in effect
              prior to the invalid <b>.FT </b>call.

              <b>.FT </b>will also accept, as an argument, a full <i>family</i> and
              <i>font name</i>.

              For example,
                     <b>.FT HB</b>
              will set subsequent type in <i>Helvetica Bold</i>.

              However, I strongly recommend keeping <i>family</i> and <i>font</i>
              separate except where doing so is genuinely inconvenient.

              For inline control of <i>fonts</i>, see <i>Inline Escapes</i>, font
              control.

       <b>.HI [ </b><i>&lt;measure&gt;</i> <b>]</b>
              Hanging indent — the optional argument requires a unit of
              measure.

              A hanging indent looks like this:
                     The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as best I
                       could, but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed
                       revenge.  You who so well know the nature of my soul
                       will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a
                       threat, at length I would be avenged...
              The first line of text <i>hangs</i> outside the <i>left margin</i>.

              In order to use <i>hanging indents</i>, you must first have a
              <i>left indent</i> active (set with either <b>.IL </b>or <b>.IB</b>).  <b>Mom </b>will
              not hang text outside the <i>left margin set</i> with <b>.L_MARGIN</b>
              or outside the <i>left margin</i> of a <i>tab</i>.

              The first time you invoke <b>.HI</b>, you must give it a <b>measure</b>.
              If you want the first line of a paragraph to <i>hang by</i>, say,
              <i>1 pica</i>, do
                     <b>.IL 1P</b>
                     <b>.HI 1P</b>
              Subsequent invocations of <b>.HI </b>do not require you to supply
              a <i>measure</i>; <i>mom</i> keeps track of the last measure you gave
              it.

              Generally speaking, you should invoke <b>.HI </b>immediately
              prior to the line you want hung (i.e. without any
              intervening control lines).  And because <i>hanging indents</i>
              affect only one line, there's no need to turn them off.

              <i>IMPORTANT:</i> Unlike <b>IL</b>, <b>IR </b>and <b>IB</b>, measures given to <b>.HI </b>are
              NOT additive.  Each time you pass a measure to <b>.HI</b>, the
              measure is treated literally.  <i>Recipe:</i> A numbered list
              using <i>hanging indents</i>

              <i>Note: mom</i> has macros for setting lists.  This recipe
              exists to demonstrate the use of <i>hanging indents</i> only.

                     1.\0The most important point to be considered is whether
                     the answer to the meaning of Life, the Universe, and
                     Everything really is 42.  We have no one's word on the
                     subject except Mr. Adams's.
                     .HI
                     2.\0If the answer to the meaning of Life, the Universe,
                     and Everything is indeed 42, what impact does this have on
                     the politics of representation?  42 is, after all not a
                     prime number.  Are we to infer that prime numbers don't
                     deserve equal rights and equal access in the universe?
                     .HI
                     3.\0If 42 is deemed non-exclusionary, how do we present
                     it as the answer and, at the same time, forestall debate
                     on its exclusionary implications?

              First, we invoke a left indent with a measure equal to the
              width of 2 figures spaces plus a period (using the \w
              inline escape).  At this point, the left indent is active;
              text afterward would normally be indented.  However, we
              invoke a hanging indent of exactly the same width, which
              hangs the first line (and first line only!) to the left of
              the indent by the same distance (in this case, that means
              “out to the left margin”).  Because we begin the first
              line with a number, a period, and a figure space, the
              actual text (<i>The most important point...</i>) starts at
              exactly the same spot as the indented lines that follow.

              Notice that subsequent invocations of <b>.HI </b>don't require a
              <i>measure</i> to be given.

              Paste the example above into a file and preview it with
                     <b>pdfmom filename.mom | ps2pdf - filename.pdf</b>
              to see hanging indents in action.

       <b>.IB [ </b><i>&lt;left measure&gt; &lt;right measure&gt;</i> <b>]</b>
              Indent both — the optional argument requires a unit of
              measure

              <b>.IB </b>allows you to set or invoke a left and a right indent
              at the same time.

              At its first invocation, you must supply a measure for
              both indents; at subsequent invocations when you wish to
              supply a measure, both must be given again.  As with <b>.IL</b>
              and <b>.IR</b>, the measures are added to the values previously
              passed to the macro.  Hence, if you wish to change just
              one of the values, you must give an argument of zero to
              the other.

              <i>A word of advice:</i> If you need to manipulate left and right
              indents separately, use a combination of <b>.IL </b>and <b>.IR</b>
              instead of <b>.IB</b>.  You'll save yourself a lot of grief.

              A <i>minus sign</i> may be prepended to the arguments to subtract
              from their current values.  The \w inline escape may be
              used to specify text-dependent measures, in which case no
              unit of measure is required.  For example,
                     <b>.IB \w'margarine' \w'jello'</b>
              left indents text by the width of the word <i>margarine</i> and
              right indents by the width of <i>jello</i>.

              Like <b>.IL </b>and <b>.IR</b>, <b>.IB </b>with no argument indents by its last
              active values.  See the brief explanation of how mom
              handles indents for more details.

              <i>Note:</i> Calling a <i>tab</i> (with <b>.TAB &lt;n&gt;</b>) automatically cancels
              any active indents.

              <i>Additional note:</i> Invoking <b>.IB </b>automatically turns off <b>.IL</b>
              and <b>.IR</b>.

       <b>.IL [ </b><i>&lt;measure&gt;</i> <b>]</b>
              Indent left — the optional argument requires a unit of
              measure

              <b>.IL </b>indents text from the left margin of the page, or if
              you're in a <i>tab</i>, from the left edge of the <i>tab</i>.  Once <i>IL</i>
              is on, the <i>left indent</i> is applied uniformly to every
              subsequent line of text, even if you change the line
              length.

              The first time you invoke <b>.IL</b>, you must give it a measure.
              Subsequent invocations with a measure add to the previous
              measure.  A minus sign may be prepended to the argument to
              subtract from the current measure.  The <b>\w </b>inline escape
              may be used to specify a text-dependent measure, in which
              case no unit of measure is required.  For example,
                     <b>.IL \w'margarine'</b>
              indents text by the width of the word <i>margarine</i>.

              With no argument, <b>.IL </b>indents by its last active value.
              See the brief explanation of how <i>mom</i> handles indents for
              more details.

              <i>Note:</i> Calling a <i>tab</i> (with <b>.TAB &lt;n&gt;</b>) automatically cancels
              any active indents.

              <i>Additional note:</i> Invoking <b>.IL </b>automatically turns off <b>IB</b>.

       <b>.IQ [ </b><i>&lt;measure&gt;</i> <b>]</b>
              IQ — quit any/all indents

              <i>IMPORTANT NOTE:</i> The original macro for quitting all
              indents was <b>.IX</b>.  This usage has been deprecated in favour
              of <b>IQ</b>.  <b>.IX </b>will continue to behave as before, but <i>mom</i>
              will issue a warning to <i>stderr</i> indicating that you should
              update your documents.

              As a consequence of this change, <b>.ILX</b>, <b>.IRX </b>and <b>.IBX </b>may
              now also be invoked as <b>.ILQ</b>, <b>.IRQ </b>and <b>.IBQ</b>.  Both forms
              are acceptable.

              Without an argument, the macros to quit indents merely
              restore your original margins and line length.  The
              measures stored in the indent macros themselves are saved
              so you can call them again without having to supply a
              measure.

              If you pass these macros the optional argument <b>CLEAR</b>, they
              not only restore your original left margin and line
              length, but also clear any values associated with a
              particular indent style.  The next time you need an indent
              of the same style, you have to supply a measure again.

              <b>.IQ CLEAR</b>, as you'd suspect, quits and clears the values
              for all indent styles at once.

       <b>.IR [ </b><i>&lt;measure&gt;</i> <b>]</b>
              Indent right — the optional argument requires a unit of
              measure

              <b>.IR </b>indents text from the <i>right margin</i> of the page, or if
              you're in a <i>tab</i>, from the end of the <i>tab</i>.

              The first time you invoke <b>.IR</b>, you must give it a measure.
              Subsequent invocations with a measure add to the previous
              indent measure.  A <i>minus sign</i> may be prepended to the
              argument to subtract from the current indent measure.  The
              \w inline escape may be used to specify a text-dependent
              measure, in which case no <i>unit of measure</i> is required.
              For example,
                     <b>.IR \w'jello'</b>
              indents text by the width of the word <i>jello</i>.

              With no argument, <b>.IR </b>indents by its last active value.
              See the brief explanation of how <i>mom</i> handles indents for
              more details.

              <i>Note:</i> Calling a <i>tab</i> (with <b>.TAB &lt;n&gt;</b>) automatically cancels
              any active indents.

              <i>Additional note:</i> Invoking <b>.IR </b>automatically turns off <b>IB</b>.

       <b>.L_MARGIN </b><i>&lt;left margin&gt;</i>
              Left Margin

              L_MARGIN establishes the distance from the left edge of
              the printer sheet at which you want your type to start.
              It may be used any time, and remains in effect until you
              enter a new value.

              Left indents and tabs are calculated from the value you
              pass to <b>.L_MARGIN</b>, hence it's always a good idea to invoke
              it before starting any serious typesetting.  A unit of
              measure is required.  Decimal fractions are allowed.
              Therefore, to set the left margin at 3 picas (1/2 inch),
              you'd enter either
                     <b>.L_MARGIN 3P</b>
              or
                     <b>.L_MARGIN .5i</b>

              If you use the macros <b>.PAGE</b>, <b>.PAGEWIDTH </b>or <b>.PAPER </b>without
              invoking <b>.L_MARGIN </b>(either before or afterward), <i>mom</i>
              automatically sets <b>.L_MARGIN </b>to <i>1 inch</i>.

              Note: <b>.L_MARGIN </b>behaves in a special way when you're using
              the document processing macros.

       <b>.MCO   </b>Begin multi-column setting.

              <b>.MCO </b>(<i>Multi-Column On</i>) is the <i>macro</i> you use to begin
              <i>multi-column setting</i>.  It marks the current baseline as
              the top of your columns, for use later with <b>.MCR</b>.  See the
              introduction to columns for an explanation of <i>multi-</i>
              <i>columns</i> and some sample input.

              <i>Note:</i> Do not confuse <b>.MCO </b>with the <b>.COLUMNS </b>macro in the
              document processing macros.

       <b>.MCR   </b>Once you've turned <i>multi-columns</i> on (with <b>.MCO</b>), <b>.MCR</b>, at
              any time, returns you to the <i>top of your columns</i>.

       <b>.MCX [ </b><i>&lt;distance to advance below longest column&gt;</i> <b>]</b>
              Optional argument requires a unit of measure.

              Exit multi-columns.

              <b>.MCX </b>takes you out of any <i>tab</i> you were in (by silently
              invoking <b>.TQ</b>) and advances to the bottom of the longest
              column.

              Without an argument, <b>.MCX </b>advances <i>1 linespace</i> below the
              longest column.

              Linespace, in this instance, is the leading in effect at
              the moment <b>.MCX </b>is invoked.

              If you pass the <i>&lt;distance&gt;</i> argument to <b>.MCX</b>, it advances <i>1</i>
              <i>linespace</i> below the longest column (see above) <i>PLUS</i> the
              distance specified by the argument.  The argument requires
              a unit of measure; therefore, to advance an extra 6 points
              below where <b>.MCX </b>would normally place you, you'd enter
                     <b>.MCX 6p</b>

              <i>Note:</i> If you wish to advance a precise distance below the
              baseline of the longest column, use <b>.MCX </b>with an argument
              of <b>0 </b>(zero; no <i>unit of measure</i> required) in conjunction
              with the <b>.ALD </b>macro, like this:
                     <b>.MCX 0</b>
                     <b>.ALD 24p</b>
              The above advances to precisely <i>24 points</i> below the
              baseline of the longest column.

       <b>.NEWPAGE</b>

              Whenever you want to start a new page, use <b>.NEWPAGE</b>, by
              itself with no argument.  <b>Mom </b>will finish up processing
              the current page and move you to the top of a new one
              (subject to the top margin set with <b>.T_MARGIN</b>).

       <b>.PAGE </b><i>&lt;width&gt;</i> <b>[ </b><i>&lt;length&gt;</i> <b>[ </b><i>&lt;lm&gt;</i> <b>[ </b><i>&lt;rm&gt;</i> <b>[ </b><i>&lt;tm&gt;</i> <b>[ </b><i>&lt;bm&gt;</i> <b>] ] ] ] ]</b>

              All arguments require a unit of measure

              <i>IMPORTANT:</i> If you're using the document processing macros,
              <b>.PAGE </b>must come after <b>.START</b>.  Otherwise, it should go at
              the top of a document, prior to any text.  And remember,
              when you're using the document processing macros, top
              margin and bottom margin mean something slightly different
              than when you're using just the typesetting macros (see
              Top and bottom margins in document processing).

              <b>.PAGE </b>lets you establish paper dimensions and page margins
              with a single macro.  The only required argument is page
              width.  The rest are optional, but they must appear in
              order and you can't skip over any.  <i>&lt;lm&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;rm&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;tm&gt;</i> and
              <i>&lt;bm&gt;</i> refer to the left, right, top and bottom margins
              respectively.

              Assuming your page dimensions are 11 inches by 17 inches,
              and that's all you want to set, enter
                     <b>.PAGE 11i 17i</b>
              If you want to set the left margin as well, say, at 1
              inch, <b>PAGE </b>would look like this:
                     <b>.PAGE 11i 17i 1i</b>

              Now suppose you also want to set the top margin, say, at
              1–1/2 inches.  <i>&lt;tm&gt;</i> comes after <i>&lt;rm&gt;</i> in the optional
              arguments, but you can't skip over any arguments,
              therefore to set the top margin, you must also give a
              right margin.  The <b>.PAGE </b>macro would look like this:
                     .PAGE 11i 17i 1i 1i 1.5i
                                      |   |
                     required right---+   +---top margin
                             margin

              Clearly, <b>.PAGE </b>is best used when you want a convenient way
              to tell <i>mom</i> just the dimensions of your printer sheet
              (width and length), or when you want to tell her
              everything about the page (dimensions and all the
              margins), for example
                     <b>.PAGE 8.5i 11i 45p 45p 45p 45p</b>
              This sets up an 8½ by 11 inch page with margins of 45
              points (5/8-inch) all around.

              Additionally, if you invoke <b>.PAGE </b>with a top margin
              argument, any macros you invoke after <b>.PAGE </b>will almost
              certainly move the baseline of the first line of text down
              by one linespace.  To compensate, do
                     <b>.RLD 1v</b>
              immediately before entering any text, or, if it's
              feasible, make <b>.PAGE </b>the last macro you invoke prior to
              entering text.

              Please read the <i>Important note</i> on page dimensions and
              papersize for information on ensuring <i>groff</i> respects your
              <b>.PAGE </b>dimensions and margins.

       <b>.PAGELENGTH </b><i>&lt;length of printer sheet&gt;</i>
              tells <i>mom</i> how long your printer sheet is.  It works just
              like <b>.PAGEWIDTH</b>.

              Therefore, to tell <i>mom</i> your printer sheet is 11 inches
              long, you enter
                     <b>.PAGELENGTH 11i</b>
              Please read the important note on page dimensions and
              papersize for information on ensuring <i>groff</i> respects your
              <i>PAGELENGTH</i>.

       <b>.PAGEWIDTH </b><i>&lt;width of printer sheet&gt;</i>

              The argument to <b>.PAGEWIDTH </b>is the width of your printer
              sheet.

              <b>.PAGEWIDTH </b>requires a unit of measure.  Decimal fractions
              are allowed.  Hence, to tell <i>mom</i> that the width of your
              printer sheet is 8½ inches, you enter
                     .PAGEWIDTH 8.5i

              Please read the Important note on page dimensions and
              papersize for information on ensuring <i>groff</i> respects your
              <i>PAGEWIDTH</i>.

       <b>.PAPER </b><i>&lt;paper type&gt;</i>
              provides a convenient way to set the page dimensions for
              some common printer sheet sizes.  The argument <i>&lt;paper</i>
              <i>type&gt;</i> can be one of: <b>LETTER</b>, <b>LEGAL</b>, <b>STATEMENT</b>, <b>TABLOID</b>,
              <b>LEDGER</b>, <b>FOLIO</b>, <b>QUARTO</b>, <b>EXECUTIVE</b>, <b>10x14</b>, <b>A3</b>, <b>A4</b>, <b>A5</b>, <b>B4</b>,
              <b>B5</b>.

       <b>.PRINTSTYLE</b>

       <b>.PT_SIZE </b><i>&lt;size of type in points&gt;</i>
              Point size of type, does not require a <i>unit of measure</i>.

              <b>.PT_SIZE </b>(<i>Point Size</i>) takes one argument: the <i>size of type</i>
              in <i>points</i>.  Unlike most other macros that establish the
              <i>size</i> or <i>measure</i> of something, <b>.PT_SIZE </b>does not require
              that you supply a <i>unit of measure</i> since it's a near
              universal convention that <i>type size</i> is measured in <i>points</i>.
              Therefore, to change the <i>type size</i> to, say, <i>11 points</i>,
              enter
                     <b>.PT_SIZE 11</b>
              <i>Point sizes</i> may be <i>fractional</i> (e.g., <i>10.25</i> or <i>12.5</i>).

              You can prepend a <i>plus</i> or a <i>minus sign</i> to the argument to
              <b>.PT_SIZE</b>, in which case the <i>point size</i> will be changed by
              <i>+</i> or <i>-</i> the original value.  For example, if the <i>point size</i>
              is <i>12</i>, and you want <i>14</i>, you can do
                     <b>.PT_SIZE +2</b>
              then later reset it to <i>12</i> with
                     <b>.PT_SIZE -2</b>
              The <i>size of type</i> can also be changed inline.

              <i>Note:</i> It is unfortunate that the <b>pic </b>preprocessor has
              already taken the name, PS, and thus <i>mom</i>'s macro for
              setting <i>point sizes</i> can't use it.  However, if you aren't
              using <b>pic</b>, you might want to alias <b>.PT_SIZE </b>as <b>.PS</b>, since
              there'd be no conflict.  For example
                     <b>.ALIAS PS PT_SIZE</b>
              would allow you to set <i>point sizes</i> with <b>.PS</b>.

       <b>.R_MARGIN </b><i>&lt;right margin&gt;</i>
              Right Margin

              Requires a unit of measure.

              IMPORTANT: <b>.R_MARGIN</b>, if used, must come after <b>.PAPER</b>,
              <b>.PAGEWIDTH</b>, <b>.L_MARGIN</b>, and/or <b>.PAGE </b>(if a right margin
              isn't given to PAGE).  The reason is that <b>.R_MARGIN</b>
              calculates line length from the overall page dimensions
              and the left margin.

              Obviously, it can't make the calculation if it doesn't
              know the page width and the left margin.

              <b>.R_MARGIN </b>establishes the amount of space you want between
              the end of typeset lines and the right hand edge of the
              printer sheet.  In other words, it sets the line length.
              <b>.R_MARGIN </b>requires a unit of measure.  Decimal fractions
              are allowed.

              The line length macro (LL) can be used in place of
              <b>.R_MARGIN</b>.  In either case, the last one invoked sets the
              line length.  The choice of which to use is up to you.  In
              some instances, you may find it easier to think of a
              section of type as having a right margin.  In others,
              giving a line length may make more sense.

              For example, if you're setting a page of type you know
              should have 6-pica margins left and right, it makes sense
              to enter a left and right margin, like this:
                     <b>.L_MARGIN 6P</b>
                     <b>.R_MARGIN 6P</b>

              That way, you don't have to worry about calculating the
              line length.  On the other hand, if you know the line
              length for a patch of type should be 17 picas and 3
              points, entering the line length with LL is much easier
              than calculating the right margin, e.g.,
                     <b>.LL 17P+3p</b>

              If you use the macros <b>.PAGE</b>, <b>.PAGEWIDTH </b>or <b>PAPER </b>without
              invoking <b>.R_MARGIN </b>afterward, <i>mom</i> automatically sets
              <b>.R_MARGIN </b>to <i>1 inch</i>.  If you set a line length after these
              macros (with <b>.LL</b>), the line length calculated by <b>.R_MARGIN</b>
              is, of course, overridden.

              Note: <b>.R_MARGIN </b>behaves in a special way when you're using
              the document processing macros.

       <b>.ST </b><i>&lt;tab number&gt;</i> <b>L | R | C | J [ QUAD ]</b>

              After <i>string tabs</i> have been marked off on an input line
              (see <b>\*[ST]...\*[STX]</b>), you need to <i>set</i> them by giving
              them a direction and, optionally, the <b>QUAD </b>argument.

              In this respect, <b>.ST </b>is like <b>.TAB_SET </b>except that you
              don't have to give <b>.ST </b>an indent or a line length (that's
              already taken care of, inline, by <b>\*[ST]...\*[STX]</b>).

              If you want string <i>tab 1</i> to be <b>left</b>, enter
                     <b>.ST 1 L</b>
              If you want it to be <i>left</i> and <i>filled</i>, enter
                     <b>.ST 1 L QUAD</b>
              If you want it to be justified, enter
                     <b>.ST 1 J</b>

       <b>.TAB </b><i>&lt;tab number&gt;</i>
              After <i>tabs</i> have been defined (either with <b>.TAB_SET </b>or
              <b>.ST</b>), <b>.TAB </b>moves to whatever <i>tab number</i> you pass it as an
              argument.

              For example,
                     <b>.TAB 3</b>
              moves you to <i>tab 3</i>.

              Note: <b>.TAB </b>breaks the line preceding it and advances 1
              linespace.  Hence,
                     <b>.TAB 1</b>
                     <b>A line of text in tab 1.</b>
                     <b>.TAB 2</b>
                     <b>A line of text in tab 2.</b>
              produces, on output
                     <b>A line of text in tab 1.</b>
                                                  <b>A line of text in tab 2.</b>

              If you want the tabs to line up, use <b>.TN </b>(“Tab Next”) or,
              more conveniently, the inline escape sequence <b>\*[TB+]</b>:
                     <b>.TAB </b>1
                     A line of text in tab 1.\*[TB+]
                     A line of text in tab 2.
              which produces
                     <b>A line of text in tab 1.   A line of text in tab 2.</b>

              If the text in your tabs runs to several lines, and you
              want the first lines of each tab to align, you must use
              the multi-column macros.

              <i>Additional note:</i> Any indents in effect prior to calling a
              tab are automatically turned off by <b>TAB</b>.  If you were
              happily zipping down the page with a left indent of <i>2</i>
              <i>picas</i> turned on, and you call a <i>tab</i> whose indent from the
              left margin is <i>6 picas</i>, your new distance from the <i>left</i>
              <i>margin</i> will be <i>6 picas</i>, not I 6 picas plus the 2 pica
              indent.

              <i>Tabs</i> are not by nature columnar, which is to say that if
              the text inside a <i>tab</i> runs to several lines, calling
              another <i>tab</i> does not automatically move to the baseline of
              the first line in the <i>previous tab</i>.  To demonstrate:
                     TAB 1
                     Carrots
                     Potatoes
                     Broccoli
                     .TAB 2
                     $1.99/5 lbs
                     $0.25/lb
                     $0.99/bunch
              produces, on output
                     Carrots
                     Potatoes
                     Broccoli
                                 $1.99/5 lbs
                                 $0.25/lb
                                 $0.99/bunch

       <b>.TB </b><i>&lt;tab number&gt;</i>
              Alias to <b>.TAB</b>

       <b>.TI [ </b><i>&lt;measure&gt;</i> <b>]</b>
              Temporary left indent — the optional argument requires a
              <i>unit of measure</i>

              A temporary indent is one that applies only to the first
              line of text that comes after it.  Its chief use is
              indenting the first line of paragraphs.  (<b>Mom's .PP </b>macro,
              for example, uses a <i>temporary indent</i>.)

              The first time you invoke <b>.TI</b>, you must give it a measure.
              If you want to <i>indent</i> the first line of a paragraph by,
              say, 2 ems, do
                     <b>.TI 2m</b>

              Subsequent invocations of <b>.TI </b>do not require you to supply
              a measure; <i>mom</i> keeps track of the last measure you gave
              it.

              Because <i>temporary indents</i> are temporary, there's no need
              to turn them off.

              <i>IMPORTANT:</i> Unlike <b>.IL</b>, <b>.IR </b>and <b>IB</b>, measures given to <b>.TI</b>
              are NOT additive.  In the following example, the second
              <b>".TI 2P" </b>is exactly <i>2 picas</i>.
                     <b>.TI 1P</b>
                     <b>The beginning of a paragraph...</b>
                     <b>.TI 2P</b>
                     <b>The beginning of another paragraph...</b>

       <b>.TN    </b>Tab Next

              Inline escape <b>\*[TB+]</b>

              <b>TN </b>moves over to the <i>next tab</i> in numeric sequence (<i>tab</i>
              <i>n+1</i>) without advancing on the page.  See the <i>NOTE</i> in the
              description of the <b>.TAB </b>macro for an example of how <b>TN</b>
              works.

              In <i>tabs</i> that aren't given the <b>QUAD </b>argument when they're
              set up with <b>.TAB_SET </b>or <b>ST</b>, you must terminate the line
              preceding <b>.TN </b>with the <b>\c </b>inline escape sequence.
              Conversely, if you did give a <b>QUAD </b>argument to <b>.TAB_SET </b>or
              <b>ST</b>, the <b>\c must not be used.</b>

              If you find remembering whether to put in the <b>\c</b>
              bothersome, you may prefer to use the inline escape
              alternative to <b>.TN</b>, <b>\*[TB+]</b>, which works consistently
              regardless of the fill mode.

              <i>Note:</i> You must put text in the input line immediately
              after <b>.TN</b>.  Stacking of <b>.TN</b>'s is not allowed.  In other
              words, you cannot do
                     .TAB 1
                     Some text\c
                     .TN
                     Some more text\c
                     .TN
                     .TN
                     Yet more text
              The above example, assuming <i>tabs</i> numbered from <i>1</i> to <i>4</i>,
              should be entered
                     .TAB 1
                     Some text\c
                     .TN
                     Some more text\c
                     .TN
                     \&amp;\c
                     .TN
                     Yet more text
              \&amp; is a zero-width, non-printing character that <i>groff</i>
              recognizes as valid input, hence meets the requirement for
              input text following <b>.TN</b>.

       <b>.TQ    TQ </b>takes you out of whatever <i>tab</i> you were in, advances <i>1</i>
              <i>linespace</i>, and restores the <i>left margin</i>, <i>line length</i>, <i>quad</i>
              <i>direction</i> and <i>fill mode</i> that were in effect prior to
              invoking any <i>tabs</i>.

       <b>.T_MARGIN </b><i>&lt;top margin&gt;</i>
              Top margin

              Requires a unit of measure

              <b>.T_MARGIN </b>establishes the distance from the top of the
              printer sheet at which you want your type to start.  It
              requires a unit of measure, and decimal fractions are
              allowed.  To set a top margin of 2½ centimetres, you'd
              enter
                     <b>.T_MARGIN 2.5c</b>
              <b>.T_MARGIN </b>calculates the vertical position of the first
              line of type on a page by treating the top edge of the
              printer sheet as a baseline.  Therefore,
                     <b>.T_MARGIN 1.5i</b>
              puts the baseline of the first line of type 1½ inches
              beneath the top of the page.

              Note: <b>.T_MARGIN </b>means something slightly different when
              you're using the document processing macros.  See Top and
              bottom margins in document processing for an explanation.

              IMPORTANT: <b>.T_MARGIN </b>does two things: it establishes the
              top margin for pages that come after it and it moves to
              that position on the current page.  Therefore, <b>.T_MARGIN</b>
              should only be used at the top of a file (prior to
              entering text) or after NEWPAGE, like this:
                     <b>.NEWPAGE</b>
                     <b>.T_MARGIN 6P</b>
                     <i>&lt;text&gt;</i>
