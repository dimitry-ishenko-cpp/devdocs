DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Generators are small executables that live in
       /usr/lib/systemd/system-environment-generators/ and other
       directories listed above.  <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> will execute those binaries
       very early at the startup of each manager and at configuration
       reload time, before running the generators described in
       <a href="systemd.generator.7.html">systemd.generator(7)</a> and before starting any units. Environment
       generators can override the environment that the manager exports
       to services and other processes.

       Generators are loaded from a set of paths determined during
       compilation, as listed above. System and user environment
       generators are loaded from directories with names ending in
       system-environment-generators/ and user-environment-generators/,
       respectively. Generators found in directories listed earlier
       override the ones with the same name in directories lower in the
       list [1]. A symlink to /dev/null or an empty file can be used to
       mask a generator, thereby preventing it from running. Please note
       that the order of the two directories with the highest priority
       is reversed with respect to the unit load path, and generators in
       /run/ overwrite those in /etc/.

       After installing new generators or updating the configuration,
       <b>systemctl daemon-reload </b>may be executed. This will re-run all
       generators, updating environment configuration. It will be used
       for any services that are started subsequently.

       Environment file generators are executed similarly to unit file
       generators described in <a href="systemd.generator.7.html">systemd.generator(7)</a>, with the following
       differences:

       â€¢   Generators are executed sequentially in the alphanumerical
           order of the final component of their name. The output of
           each generator output is immediately parsed and used to
           update the environment for generators that run after that.
           Thus, later generators can use and/or modify the output of
           earlier generators.

       â€¢   Generators are run by every manager instance, their output
           can be different for each user.

       It is recommended to use numerical prefixes for generator names
       to simplify ordering.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Example 1. A simple generator that extends an environment</b>
       <b>variable if a directory exists in the file system</b>

           # 50-xdg-data-dirs.sh

           #!/bin/sh
           # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT-0

           # set the default value
           XDG_DATA_DIRS="${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share}"

           # add a directory if it exists
           if [ -d /opt/foo/share ]; then
               XDG_DATA_DIRS="/opt/foo/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS}"
           fi

           # write our output
           echo "XDG_DATA_DIRS=${XDG_DATA_DIRS}"

       <b>Example 2. A more complicated generator which reads existing</b>
       <b>configuration and mutates one variable</b>

           # 90-rearrange-path.py

           #!/usr/bin/env python3

           """

           Proof-of-concept systemd environment generator that makes sure that bin dirs
           are always after matching sbin dirs in the path.
           (Changes /sbin:/bin:/foo/bar to /bin:/sbin:/foo/bar.)

           This generator shows how to override the configuration possibly created by
           earlier generators. It would be easier to write in bash, but let's have it
           in Python just to prove that we can, and to serve as a template for more
           interesting generators.
