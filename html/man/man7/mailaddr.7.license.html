Extensively rewritten by Arnt Gulbrandsen &lt;agulbra@troll.no&gt;.  My
changes are placed under the same copyright as the original BSD page.

Adjusted by Arnt Gulbrandsen &lt;arnt@gulbrandsen.priv.no&gt; in 2004 to
account for changes since 1995. Route-addrs are now even less
common, etc. Some minor wording improvements. Same copyright.
