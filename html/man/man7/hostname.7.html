       hostname - hostname resolution description
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Hostnames are domains, where a domain is a hierarchical, dot-
       separated list of subdomains; for example, the machine "monet",
       in the "example" subdomain of the "com" domain would be
       represented as "monet.example.com".

       Each element of the hostname must be from 1 to 63 characters long
       and the entire hostname, including the dots, can be at most 253
       characters long.  Valid characters for hostnames are <a href="ascii.7.html">ASCII(7)</a>
       letters from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>, the digits from <i>0</i> to <i>9</i>, and the hyphen (-).
       A hostname may not start with a hyphen.

       Hostnames are often used with network client and server programs,
       which must generally translate the name to an address for use.
       (This task is generally performed by either <a href="../man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo(3)</a> or the
       obsolete <a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname(3)</a>.)

       Hostnames are resolved by the NSS framework in glibc according to
       the <b>hosts </b>configuration in <a href="../man5/nsswitch.conf.5.html">nsswitch.conf(5)</a>.  The DNS-based name
       resolver (in the <b>dns </b>NSS service module) resolves them in the
       following fashion.

       If the name consists of a single component, that is, contains no
       dot, and if the environment variable <b>HOSTALIASES </b>is set to the
       name of a file, that file is searched for any string matching the
       input hostname.  The file should consist of lines made up of two
       white-space separated strings, the first of which is the hostname
       alias, and the second of which is the complete hostname to be
       substituted for that alias.  If a case-insensitive match is found
       between the hostname to be resolved and the first field of a line
       in the file, the substituted name is looked up with no further
       processing.

       If the input name ends with a trailing dot, the trailing dot is
       removed, and the remaining name is looked up with no further
       processing.

       If the input name does not end with a trailing dot, it is looked
       up by searching through a list of domains until a match is found.
       The default search list includes first the local domain, then its
       parent domains with at least 2 name components (longest first).
       For example, in the domain cs.example.com, the name lithium.cchem
       will be checked first as lithium.cchem.cs.example and then as
       lithium.cchem.example.com.  lithium.cchem.com will not be tried,
       as there is only one component remaining from the local domain.
       The search path can be changed from the default by a system-wide
       configuration file (see <a href="../man5/resolver.5.html">resolver(5)</a>).
