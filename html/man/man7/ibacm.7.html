NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ibacm - InfiniBand communication management assistant
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;infiniband/acm.h&gt;</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Used to resolve remote endpoint information before establishing
       communications over InfiniBand.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Th IB ACM provides scalable address and route resolution services
       over InfiniBand.  It resolves system network names and IP
       addresses to InfiniBand path record data using efficient
       mechanisms, including caching of data.

       The IB ACM provides information needed to establish a connection,
       but does not implement the communication management protocol.  It
       provides services similar to rdma_getaddrinfo, rdma_resolve_addr,
       and rdma_resolve_route using IB multicast.  The IB ACM does not
       require IPoIB or use standard naming services, such as DNS, and
       limits network communication, especially with the IB SA.  The
       ib_acme utility assists in verifying what options of the ibacm
       service may be usable for the current fabric topology.

       Client interactions with the ibacm service are done over sockets
       through a standard TCP connection.  The librdmacm abstracts this
       interaction.
