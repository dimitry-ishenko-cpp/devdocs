</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is an implementation of the SCTP protocol as defined in
       RFC4960. It is a message oriented, reliable transport protocol
       with direct support for multihoming that runs on top of <a href="ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>,
       and supports both v4 and v6 versions.

       Like TCP, SCTP provides reliable, connection oriented data
       delivery with congestion control. Unlike TCP, SCTP also provides
       message boundary preservation, ordered and unordered message
       delivery, multi-streaming and multi-homing. Detection of data
       corruption, loss of data and duplication of data is achieved by
       using checksums and sequence numbers. A selective retransmission
       mechanism is applied to correct loss or corruption of data.

       This implementation supports a mapping of SCTP into sockets API
       as defined in the RFC6458(Sockets API extensions for SCTP). Two
       styles of interfaces are supported.

       A <b>one-to-many </b>style interface with 1 to MANY relationship between
       socket and associations where the outbound association setup is
       implicit. The syntax of a one-to-many style socket() call is

       <b>sd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_SEQPACKET, IPPROTO_SCTP);</b>

       A typical server in this style uses the following socket calls in
       sequence to prepare an endpoint for servicing requests.

            1. socket()
            2. bind()
            3. listen()
            4. recvmsg()
            5. sendmsg()
            6. close()

       A typical client uses the following calls in sequence to setup an
       association with a server to request services.

            1. socket()
            2. sendmsg()
            3. recvmsg()
            4. close()

       A <b>one-to-one style </b>interface with a 1 to 1 relationship between
       socket and association which enables existing TCP applications to
       be ported to SCTP with very little effort. The syntax of a one-
       to-one style socket() call is

       <b>sd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP);</b>

       A typical server in one-to-one style uses the following system
       call sequence to prepare an SCTP endpoint for servicing requests:

            1. socket()
            2. bind()
            3. listen()
            4. accept()

       The accept() call blocks until a new association is set up. It
       returns with a new socket descriptor. The server then uses the
       new socket descriptor to communicate with the client, using
       recv() and send() calls to get requests and send back responses.
       Then it calls

            5. close()

       to terminate the association. A typical client uses the following
       system call sequence to setup an association with a server to
       request services:

            1. socket()
            2. connect()

       After returning from connect(), the client uses send() and recv()
       calls to send out requests and receive responses from the server.
       The client calls

            3. close()

       to terminate this association when done.
</pre> <h2>
ADDRESS FORMATS </h2>
<pre>
       SCTP is built on top of IP (see <a href="ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>).  The address formats
       defined by <a href="ip.7.html">ip(7)</a> apply to SCTP.  SCTP only supports point-to-
       point communication; broadcasting and multicasting are not
       supported.
</pre> <h2>
SYSCTLS </h2>
<pre>
       These variables can be accessed by the <b>/proc/sys/net/sctp/* </b>files
       or with the <a href="../man2/sysctl.2.html">sysctl(2)</a> interface.  In addition, most IP sysctls
       also apply to SCTP. See <a href="ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>.

       Please check kernel documentation for this, at
       Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.rst.
</pre> <h2>

</pre> <h2>
CONTROL MSGS </h2>
<pre>
       The ancillary data is carried in msg_control field of struct
       msghdr, which is used in <a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg(2)</a> call. The SCTP
       stack uses the ancillary data to communicate the attributes, such
       as SCTP_RCVINFO, of the message stored in msg_iov to the socket
       endpoint.  Each ancillary data item is preceded by a struct
       cmsghdr, see <a href="../man3/cmsg.3.html">cmsg(3)</a>.  The different cmsg types for SCTP are
       listed below, and all these related macros and structures are
       defined in /usr/include/netinet/sctp.h.

       <b>SCTP_INIT</b>
              This cmsg provides information for initializing new SCTP
              associations for sendmsg() with struct sctp_initmsg, which
              is the same as SCTP_INITMSG socket option's data
              structure.

       <b>SCTP_SNDRCV</b>
              This cmsg specifies SCTP options for sendmsg() and
              describes SCTP header information about a received message
              through recvmsg() with struct sctp_sndrcvinfo. It mixes
              the send and receive path, and SCTP_SNDINFO and
              SCTP_RCVINFO split this information, so these structures
              should be used, when possible, since SCTP_SNDRCV is
              deprecated.  <a href="../man3/sctp_sendmsg.3.html">sctp_sendmsg(3)</a> and <a href="../man3/sctp_send.3.html">sctp_send(3)</a> provide a
              simple way to use this cmsg.

              Note that an application must use the SCTP_RECVRCVINFO
              socket option to enable the delivery of this information.

       <b>SCTP_EXTRCV</b>
              This cmsg specifies SCTP options for SCTP header
              information about a received message via recvmsg() with
              struct sctp_extrcvinfo, and this structure is an extended
              version of SCTP_SNDRCV. Note that data in the next message
              is not valid unless the current message is completely
              read, i.e., unless the MSG_EOR is set. SCTP_NXTINFO should
              be used when possible, since SCTP_EXTRCV is considered
              deprecated.  <a href="../man3/sctp_recvmsg.3.html">sctp_recvmsg(3)</a> provides a simple way to use
              this cmsg.

              Note that an application must use the SCTP_RECVNXTINFO
              socket option to enable the delivery of this information.

       <b>SCTP_RCVINFO, SCTP_NXTINFO</b>
              These cmsgs describe SCTP receive information about a
              received message through recvmsg() with struct
              sctp_rcvinfo, and SCTP receive information of the next
              message that will be delivered through recvmsg() if this
              information is already available when delivering the
              current message with struct sctp_nxtinfo.  <a href="../man3/sctp_recvv.3.html">sctp_recvv(3)</a>
              provides a simple way to use these cmsgs.

              Note that an application must use the SCTP_RECVRCVINFO and
              SCTP_RECVNXTINFO socket options accordingly to enable the
              delivery of this information.

       <b>SCTP_SNDINFO, SCTP_PRINFO, SCTP_AUTHINFO, SCTP_DSTADDRV4,</b>
       <b>SCTP_DSTADDRV6</b>
              These cmsgs specifie a couple of SCTP options for
              sendmsg() for SEND, PRSCTP, AUTH and DSTADDR information
              with struct sctp_sndinfo, sctp_prinfo, sctp_authinfo and
              in(6)_addr accordingly.  <a href="../man3/sctp_sendv.3.html">sctp_sendv(3)</a> provides a simple
              way to use these cmsgs.
</pre> <h2>
EVENTS and NOTIFICATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       An SCTP application may need to understand and process events and
       errors that happen on the SCTP stack. These events include
       network status changes, association startups, remote operational
       errors, and undeliverable messages.  When a notification arrives,
       recvmsg() returns the notification in the application-supplied
       data buffer via msg_iov, and sets MSG_NOTIFICATION in msg_flags.
       See socket option SCTP_EVENT for the event enabling. The
       different events are listed below, and all these related macros
       and structures are defined in /usr/include/netinet/sctp.h.

       <b>SCTP_ASSOC_CHANGE</b>
              Communication notifications inform the application that an
              SCTP association has either begun or ended. The
              notification format is struct sctp_assoc_change.

       <b>SCTP_PEER_ADDR_CHANGE</b>
              When a destination address of a multi-homed peer
              encounters a state change, a peer address change event is
              sent. The notification format is struct sctp_paddr_change.

       <b>SCTP_REMOTE_ERROR</b>
              A remote peer may send an Operation Error message to its
              peer.  This message indicates a variety of error
              conditions on an association.  The notification format is
              struct sctp_remote_error.

       <b>SCTP_SEND_FAILED</b>
              If SCTP cannot deliver a message, it can return back the
              message as a notification if the SCTP_SEND_FAILED event is
              enabled. The notification format is struct
              sctp_send_failed. Please note that this notification is
              deprecated. Use SCTP_SEND_FAILED_EVENT instead.

       <b>SCTP_SHUTDOWN_EVENT</b>
              When a peer sends a SHUTDOWN, SCTP delivers this
              notification to inform the application that it should
              cease sending data. The notification format is struct
              sctp_shutdown_event.

       <b>SCTP_ADAPTATION_INDICATION</b>
              When a peer sends an Adaptation Layer Indication
              parameter, SCTP delivers this notification to inform the
              application about the peer's adaptation layer indication.
              The notification format is struct sctp_adaptation_event.

       <b>SCTP_PARTIAL_DELIVERY_EVENT</b>
              When a receiver is engaged in a partial delivery of a
              message, this notification will be used to indicate
              various events. The notification format is struct
              sctp_pdapi_event.

       <b>SCTP_AUTHENTICATION_EVENT</b>
              This is used to report different events relating to the
              use of the extension to authenticate SCTP messages. The
              notification format is struct sctp_authkey_event.

       <b>SCTP_SENDER_DRY_EVENT</b>
              When the SCTP stack has no more user data to send or
              retransmit, this notification is given to the user.  Also,
              at the time when a user app subscribes to this event, if
              there is no data to be sent or retransmit, the stack will
              immediately send up this notification. The notification
              format is struct sctp_sender_dry_event.

       <b>SCTP_SEND_FAILED_EVENT</b>
              If SCTP cannot deliver a message, it can return back the
              message as a notification if the SCTP_SEND_FAILED_EVENT
              event is enabled. The notification format is struct
              sctp_send_failed_event.
</pre> <h2>
SOCKET OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       To set or get a SCTP socket option, call <a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a> to read or
       <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> to write the option with the option level argument
       set to <b>SOL_SCTP.  </b>Note that all these macros and structures
       described for parameters are defined in
       /usr/include/netinet/sctp.h, and for one-to-one style sockets a
       specified assoc_id works the same as SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC.

       <b>SCTP_RTOINFO.</b>
              This option is used to get or set the protocol parameters
              used to initialize and bound retransmission timeout(RTO).

              The parameter type is struct sctp_rtoinfo, for reading and
              writing.  srto_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or
              SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC.

              Default: srto_max=sysctl_net.sctp.rto_max,
              srto_min=sysctl_net.sctp.rto_min,
              srto_initial=sysctl_net.sctp.rto_initial.

       <b>SCTP_ASSOCINFO</b>
              This option is used to both examine and set various
              association and endpoint parameters.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_assocparams, for reading
              and writing.  sasoc_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or
              SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC. Note that some fields of this structure
              are for reading only:

                struct sctp_assocparams {
                        sctp_assoc_t    sasoc_assoc_id;
                        __u16           sasoc_asocmaxrxt; (RW)
                        __u16           sasoc_number_peer_destinations;
              (R)
                        __u32           sasoc_peer_rwnd; (R)
                        __u32           sasoc_local_rwnd; (R)
                        __u32           sasoc_cookie_life; (RW)

       <b>SCTP_NODELAY</b>
              Turn on/off any Nagle-like algorithm. This means that
              packets are generally sent as soon as possible and no
              unnecessary delays are introduced, at the cost of more
              packets in the network.

              The parameter type is int boolean, for reading and
              writing.

              Default: 0.

       <b>SCTP_AUTOCLOSE</b>
              This socket option is applicable to the one-to-many style
              socket only.  When set it will cause associations that are
              idle for more than the specified number of seconds to
              automatically close. An association being idle is defined
              an association that has NOT sent or received user data
              within a period.

              The parameter type is int(seconds), for reading and
              writing. 0 indicates that no automatic close of any
              associations should be performed.

              Default: sysctl_net.sctp.max_autoclose.

       <b>SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR</b>
              Requests that the peer mark the enclosed address as the
              association primary. The enclosed address must be one of
              the association's locally bound addresses.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_setpeerprim, for writing
              only.  sspp_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id.

              Default: the 1st local address added.  Require:
              SCTP_ASCONF_SUPPORTED.

       <b>SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR</b>
              Requests that the local SCTP stack use the enclosed peer
              address as the association primary. The enclosed address

              The parameter type is struct sctp_prim, for writing only.
              ssp_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id.

              Default: the 1st peer address added.  Require:
              SCTP_ASCONF_SUPPORTED.

       <b>SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS</b>
              If enabled no SCTP message fragmentation will be
              performed. Instead if a message being sent exceeds the
              current PMTU size, the message will NOT be sent and an
              error will be indicated to the user.

              The parameter type is int boolean, for reading and
              writing.

              Default: 0.

       <b>SCTP_PEER_ADDR_PARAMS</b>
              Using this option, applications can enable or disable
              heartbeats for any peer address of an association, modify
              an address's heartbeat interval, force a heartbeat to be
              sent immediately, and adjust the address's maximum number
              of retransmissions sent before an address is considered
              unreachable.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_paddrparams, for reading
              and writing.  spp_address is a specified transport address
              or 0, spp_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or

       <b>SCTP_DEFAULT_SEND_PARAM</b>
              Applications that wish to use the sendto() system call may
              wish to specify a default set of parameters that would
              normally be supplied through the inclusion of ancillary
              data. This option has been obsoleted by
              SCTP_DEFAULT_SNDINFO.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_sndrcvinfo. For reading,
              sinfo_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or
              SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC. For writing, sinfo_assoc_id is a
              specified assoc_id or SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

              Default: default_stream=0, default_flags=0,

       <b>SCTP_EVENTS</b>
              This socket option is used to specify various
              notifications and ancillary data the user wishes to
              receive. This option has been obsoleted by SCTP_EVENT.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_event_subscribe, for
              reading and writing.

              Default: 0.

       <b>SCTP_I_WANT_MAPPED_V4_ADDR</b>
              This socket option is used to turn on or off mapped V4
              addresses. If this option is turned on and the socket is
              type PF_INET6, then IPv4 addresses will be mapped to V6
              representation. If this option is turned off, then no
              mapping will be done of V4 addresses and a user will
              receive both PF_INET6 and PF_INET type addresses on the
              socket.

              The parameter type is int boolean, for reading and
              writing.

              Default: 1.

       <b>SCTP_MAXSEG</b>
              This socket option specifies the maximum size to put in
              any outgoing SCTP DATA chunk. If a message is larger than
              this size it will be fragmented by SCTP into the specified
              size. Note that the underlying SCTP implementation may
              fragment into smaller sized chunks when the PMTU of the
              underlying association is smaller than the value set by
              the user. 0 indicates the user is NOT limiting
              fragmentation and only the PMTU will effect SCTP's choice
              of DATA chunk size.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_assoc_value, for reading
              and writing.  assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or

              an association, including association state, peer receiver
              window size, number of unacked data chunks, and number of
              data chunks pending receipt.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_status, for reading
              only. sstat_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id.

       <b>SCTP_GET_PEER_ADDR_INFO</b>
              Applications can retrieve information about a specific
              peer address of an association, including its reachability
              state, congestion window, and retransmission timer values.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_paddrinfo, for reading
              only. spinfo_address is a specified transport address,
              sas_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC.

       <b>SCTP_GET_ASSOC_STATS</b>
              Applications can retrieve current statistics about an
              association, including SACKs sent and received, SCTP
              packets sent and received.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_assoc_stats, for reading
              only.  sas_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id.

       <b>SCTP_DELAYED_ACK, SCTP_DELAYED_ACK_TIME, SCTP_DELAYED_SACK</b>
              These options will affect the way delayed SACKs are
              performed. They allow the application to get or set the
              delayed SACK time, in milliseconds, and also allow
              changing the delayed SACK frequency. Changing the
              frequency to 1 disables the delayed SACK algorithm. Note
              that if sack_delay or sack_freq is 0 when setting this
              option, the current values will remain unchanged.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_sack_info. For reading,
              sack_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or
              SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC. For writing, sack_assoc_id is a
              specified assoc_id or SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

              Default:
              sackdelay=sysctl_net.sctp.sack_timeout,sackfreq=2.

       <b>SCTP_CONTEXT</b>
              This option allows the setting, on an association basis,
              of a default context that will be received on reading
              messages from the peer.  This is especially helpful for an
              application when using one-to-many style sockets to keep
              some reference to an internal state machine that is
              processing messages on the association.  Note that the
              setting of this value only affects received messages from
              the peer and does not affect the value that is saved with
              outbound messages.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_assoc_value. For
              reading, assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or
              SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC. For writing, assoc_id is a specified
              assoc_id or SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

              Default: 0.

       <b>SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE</b>
              Fragmented interleave controls how the presentation of
              messages occurs for the message receiver. There are three
              levels of fragment interleave defined: level 0:
              SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE = 0; level 1:
              SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE = 1; level 2:
              SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE = 1 &amp; SCTP_INTERLEAVING_SUPPORTED
              = 1.

              The parameter type is int boolean, for reading and
              writing.

              Default: 0.

       <b>SCTP_PARTIAL_DELIVERY_POINT</b>
              This option will set or get the SCTP partial delivery
              point.  This point is the size of a message where the
              partial delivery API will be invoked to help free up rwnd
              space for the peer.  Setting this to a lower value will
              cause partial deliveries to happen more often.  This
              option expects an integer that sets or gets the partial
              delivery point in bytes.  Note also that the call will
              fail if the user attempts to set this value larger than
              the socket receive buffer size. Note that any single
              message having a length smaller than or equal to the SCTP
              partial delivery point will be delivered in a single read
              call as long as the user-provided buffer is large enough
              to hold the message.

              The parameter type is uint32_t, for reading and writing.

              Default: 0.

       <b>SCTP_MAX_BURST</b>
              This option will allow a user to change the maximum burst
              of packets that can be emitted by this association.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_assoc_value. For
              reading, assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or
              SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC. For writing, assoc_id is a specified
              assoc_id or SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

              Default: sysctl_net.sctp.max_burst.

              affects the future associations.

              The parameter type is struct sauth_chunk, for writing
              only.

              Default: no chunks.  Require: SCTP_AUTH_SUPPORTED.  RFC:
              RFC4895.

       <b>SCTP_HMAC_IDENT</b>
              This option gets or sets the list of Hashed Message
              Authentication Code (HMAC) algorithms that the local
              endpoint requires the peer to use.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_hmacalgo, for reading
              and writing.  shmac_idents can include
              SCTP_AUTH_HMAC_ID_{SHA1|SHA256}.

              Default: SCTP_AUTH_HMAC_ID_SHA1.  Require:
              SCTP_AUTH_SUPPORTED.

       <b>SCTP_AUTH_KEY</b>
              This option will set a shared secret key that is used to
              build an association shared key.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_authkey, for writing
              only. sca_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or

       <b>SCTP_GET_ASSOC_NUMBER</b>
              This option gets the current number of associations that
              are attached to a one-to-many style socket. Note that this
              number is only a snapshot.  This means that the number of
              associations may have changed when the caller gets back
              the option result.

              The parameter type is uint32_t, for reading only.

       <b>SCTP_GET_ASSOC_ID_LIST</b>

              identifiers of the SCTP associations handled by a one-to-
              many style socket. It uses struct sctp_assoc_ids and must
              provide a large enough buffer to hold all association
              identifiers. If the buffer is too small, an error must be
              returned. The user can use the SCTP_GET_ASSOC_NUMBER

              Applications can control the exposure of the PF path state
              in the SCTP_PEER_ADDR_CHANGE event, and if pf_expose is
              not 'enabled', no notification will be sent for a
              transport state change to SCTP_PF.  It also affects the
              SCTP_GET_PEER_ADDR_INFO socket option, and if pf_expose is
              'disabled', users can not access the transport info via
              SCTP_GET_PEER_ADDR_INFO option.
