       pipe - overview of pipes and FIFOs
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Pipes and FIFOs (also known as named pipes) provide a
       unidirectional interprocess communication channel.  A pipe has a
       <i>read end</i> and a <i>write end</i>.  Data written to the write end of a
       pipe can be read from the read end of the pipe.

       A pipe is created using <a href="../man2/pipe.2.html">pipe(2)</a>, which creates a new pipe and
       returns two file descriptors, one referring to the read end of
       the pipe, the other referring to the write end.  Pipes can be
       used to create a communication channel between related processes;
       see <a href="../man2/pipe.2.html">pipe(2)</a> for an example.

       A FIFO (short for First In First Out) has a name within the
       filesystem (created using <a href="../man3/mkfifo.3.html">mkfifo(3)</a>), and is opened using
       <a href="../man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a>.  Any process may open a FIFO, assuming the file
       permissions allow it.  The read end is opened using the <b>O_RDONLY</b>
       flag; the write end is opened using the <b>O_WRONLY </b>flag.  See
       <a href="fifo.7.html">fifo(7)</a> for further details.  <i>Note</i>: although FIFOs have a
       pathname in the filesystem, I/O on FIFOs does not involve
       operations on the underlying device (if there is one).

   <b>I/O on pipes and FIFOs</b>
       The only difference between pipes and FIFOs is the manner in
       which they are created and opened.  Once these tasks have been
       accomplished, I/O on pipes and FIFOs has exactly the same
       semantics.

       If a process attempts to read from an empty pipe, then <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>
       will block until data is available.  If a process attempts to
       write to a full pipe (see below), then <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> blocks until
       sufficient data has been read from the pipe to allow the write to
       complete.

       Nonblocking I/O is possible by using the <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> <b>F_SETFL</b>
       operation to enable the <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>open file status flag or by
       opening a <a href="fifo.7.html">fifo(7)</a> with <b>O_NONBLOCK</b>.  If any process has the pipe
       open for writing, reads fail with <b>EAGAIN</b>; otherwise—with no
       potential writers—reads succeed and return empty.

       The communication channel provided by a pipe is a <i>byte stream</i>:
       there is no concept of message boundaries.

       If all file descriptors referring to the write end of a pipe have
       been closed, then an attempt to <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> from the pipe will see
       end-of-file (<a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> will return 0).  If all file descriptors
       referring to the read end of a pipe have been closed, then a
       <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> will cause a <b>SIGPIPE </b>signal to be generated for the
       calling process.  If the calling process is ignoring this signal,
       then <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> fails with the error <b>EPIPE</b>.  An application that
       uses <a href="../man2/pipe.2.html">pipe(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> should use suitable <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a> calls to
       close unnecessary duplicate file descriptors; this ensures that
       end-of-file and <b>SIGPIPE</b>/<b>EPIPE </b>are delivered when appropriate.

       It is not possible to apply <a href="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek(2)</a> to a pipe.

   <b>Pipe capacity</b>
       A pipe has a limited capacity.  If the pipe is full, then a
       <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> will block or fail, depending on whether the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b>
       flag is set (see below).  Different implementations have
       different limits for the pipe capacity.  Applications should not
       rely on a particular capacity: an application should be designed
       so that a reading process consumes data as soon as it is
       available, so that a writing process does not remain blocked.

       Before Linux 2.6.11, the capacity of a pipe was the same as the
       system page size (e.g., 4096 bytes on i386).  Since Linux 2.6.11,
       the pipe capacity is 16 pages (i.e., 65,536 bytes in a system
       with a page size of 4096 bytes).  Since Linux 2.6.35, the default
       pipe capacity is 16 pages, but the capacity can be queried and
       set using the <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> <b>F_GETPIPE_SZ </b>and <b>F_SETPIPE_SZ </b>operations.
       See <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> for more information.

       The following <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> operation, which can be applied to a file
       descriptor that refers to either end of a pipe, places a count of
       the number of unread bytes in the pipe in the <i>int</i> buffer pointed
       to by the final argument of the call:

           ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &amp;nbytes);

       The <b>FIONREAD </b>operation is not specified in any standard, but is
       provided on many implementations.

   <b>/proc files</b>
       On Linux, the following files control how much memory can be used
       for pipes:

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-pages</i> (only in Linux 2.6.34)
              An upper limit, in pages, on the capacity that an
              unprivileged user (one without the <b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b>
              capability) can set for a pipe.

              The default value for this limit is 16 times the default
              pipe capacity (see above); the lower limit is two pages.

              This interface was removed in Linux 2.6.35, in favor of
              <i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size</i>.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size</i> (since Linux 2.6.35)
              The maximum size (in bytes) of individual pipes that can
              be set by users without the <b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE </b>capability.
              The value assigned to this file may be rounded upward, to
              reflect the value actually employed for a convenient
              implementation.  To determine the rounded-up value,
              display the contents of this file after assigning a value
              to it.

              The default value for this file is 1048576 (1 MiB).  The
              minimum value that can be assigned to this file is the
              system page size.  Attempts to set a limit less than the
              page size cause <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> to fail with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.

              Since Linux 4.9, the value on this file also acts as a
              ceiling on the default capacity of a new pipe or newly
              opened FIFO.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard</i> (since Linux 4.5)
              The hard limit on the total size (in pages) of all pipes
              created or set by a single unprivileged user (i.e., one
              with neither the <b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE </b>nor the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>
              capability).  So long as the total number of pages
              allocated to pipe buffers for this user is at this limit,
              attempts to create new pipes will be denied, and attempts
              to increase a pipe's capacity will be denied.

              When the value of this limit is zero (which is the
              default), no hard limit is applied.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-soft</i> (since Linux 4.5)
              The soft limit on the total size (in pages) of all pipes
              created or set by a single unprivileged user (i.e., one
              with neither the <b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE </b>nor the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>
              capability).  So long as the total number of pages
              allocated to pipe buffers for this user is at this limit,
              individual pipes created by a user will be limited to one
              page, and attempts to increase a pipe's capacity will be
              denied.

              When the value of this limit is zero, no soft limit is
              applied.  The default value for this file is 16384, which
              permits creating up to 1024 pipes with the default
              capacity.

       Before Linux 4.9, some bugs affected the handling of the
       <i>pipe-user-pages-soft</i> and <i>pipe-user-pages-hard</i> limits; see BUGS.

   <b>PIPE_BUF</b>
       POSIX.1 says that writes of less than <b>PIPE_BUF </b>bytes must be
       atomic: the output data is written to the pipe as a contiguous
       sequence.  Writes of more than <b>PIPE_BUF </b>bytes may be nonatomic:
       the kernel may interleave the data with data written by other
       processes.  POSIX.1 requires <b>PIPE_BUF </b>to be at least 512 bytes.
       (On Linux, <b>PIPE_BUF </b>is 4096 bytes.)  The precise semantics depend
       on whether the file descriptor is nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>),
       whether there are multiple writers to the pipe, and on <i>n</i>, the
       number of bytes to be written:

       <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>disabled, <i>n</i> &lt;= <b>PIPE_BUF</b>
              All <i>n</i> bytes are written atomically; <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> may block if
              there is not room for <i>n</i> bytes to be written immediately

       <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>enabled, <i>n</i> &lt;= <b>PIPE_BUF</b>
              If there is room to write <i>n</i> bytes to the pipe, then
              <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> succeeds immediately, writing all <i>n</i> bytes;
              otherwise <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> fails, with <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>EAGAIN</b>.

       <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>disabled, <i>n</i> &gt; <b>PIPE_BUF</b>
              The write is nonatomic: the data given to <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> may be
              interleaved with <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>s by other process; the <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>
              blocks until <i>n</i> bytes have been written.

       <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>enabled, <i>n</i> &gt; <b>PIPE_BUF</b>
              If the pipe is full, then <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> fails, with <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set
              to <b>EAGAIN</b>.  Otherwise, from 1 to <i>n</i> bytes may be written
              (i.e., a "partial write" may occur; the caller should
              check the return value from <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> to see how many bytes
              were actually written), and these bytes may be interleaved
              with writes by other processes.

   <b>Open file status flags</b>
       The only open file status flags that can be meaningfully applied
       to a pipe or FIFO are <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>and <b>O_ASYNC</b>.

       Setting the <b>O_ASYNC </b>flag for the read end of a pipe causes a
       signal (<b>SIGIO </b>by default) to be generated when new input becomes
       available on the pipe.  The target for delivery of signals must
       be set using the <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> <b>F_SETOWN </b>command.  On Linux, <b>O_ASYNC </b>is
       supported for pipes and FIFOs only since Linux 2.6.

   <b>Portability notes</b>
       On some systems (but not Linux), pipes are bidirectional: data
       can be transmitted in both directions between the pipe ends.
       POSIX.1 requires only unidirectional pipes.  Portable
       applications should avoid reliance on bidirectional pipe
       semantics.

   <b>BUGS</b>
       Before Linux 4.9, some bugs affected the handling of the
       <i>pipe-user-pages-soft</i> and <i>pipe-user-pages-hard</i> limits when using
       the <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> <b>F_SETPIPE_SZ </b>operation to change a pipe's capacity:

       (a)  When increasing the pipe capacity, the checks against the
            soft and hard limits were made against existing consumption,
            and excluded the memory required for the increased pipe
            capacity.  The new increase in pipe capacity could then push
            the total memory used by the user for pipes (possibly far)
            over a limit.  (This could also trigger the problem
            described next.)

            Starting with Linux 4.9, the limit checking includes the
            memory required for the new pipe capacity.

       (b)  The limit checks were performed even when the new pipe
            capacity was less than the existing pipe capacity.  This
            could lead to problems if a user set a large pipe capacity,
            and then the limits were lowered, with the result that the
            user could no longer decrease the pipe capacity.

            Starting with Linux 4.9, checks against the limits are
            performed only when increasing a pipe's capacity; an
            unprivileged user can always decrease a pipe's capacity.

       (c)  The accounting and checking against the limits were done as
            follows:

            (1)  Test whether the user has exceeded the limit.
            (2)  Make the new pipe buffer allocation.
            (3)  Account new allocation against the limits.

            This was racey.  Multiple processes could pass point (1)
            simultaneously, and then allocate pipe buffers that were
            accounted for only in step (3), with the result that the
            user's pipe buffer allocation could be pushed over the
            limit.

            Starting with Linux 4.9, the accounting step is performed
            before doing the allocation, and the operation fails if the
            limit would be exceeded.

       Before Linux 4.9, bugs similar to points (a) and (c) could also
       occur when the kernel allocated memory for a new pipe buffer;
       that is, when calling <a href="../man2/pipe.2.html">pipe(2)</a> and when opening a previously
       unopened FIFO.
