NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-build-api - source package dpkg build API level
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
        Build-Depends:
         dpkg-build-api (= 1),
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The source package dpkg build API level, defines a versioned
       interface for source packages, where each API level provides
       specific behaviors and guarantees.

       These interfaces can then be adopted by packages in a gradual
       way, and phased out more easily than with global behavior
       changes.

       The declaration of this API level is done through build-
       dependencies, in one of <b>Build-Depends</b>, <b>Build-Depends-Indep </b>or
       <b>Build-Depends-Arch</b>, or via the environment variable
       <b>DPKG_BUILD_API</b>, which will override these if both are present,
       and might emit a warning in case they are different.
</pre> <h2>
API LEVELS </h2>
<pre>
       v2  This level is still under development, and cannot be declared
           via build-dependencies.

       v1  This is the recommended level.  Since dpkg 1.22.0.

           Changes from v0 are:

           •   <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>no longer uses the <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>
               environment variable.  The <b>-l </b>option should be used
               instead.

           •   <b>dpkg-buildpackage </b>defaults to <b>Rules-Requires-Root </b>value
               <b>no</b>.  To restore the <b>v0 </b>behavior <b>Rules-Requires-Root</b>
               should be set to <b>binary-targets</b>.

           •   <b>dpkg-buildpackage </b>expects all required <i>debian/rules</i>
               targets to be supported and no longer has backwards
               compatibility fallback code.  The required targets are
               <b>clean</b>, <b>build</b>, <b>build-indep</b>, <b>build-arch</b>, <b>binary-indep </b>and
               <b>binary-arch</b>.

           •   <b>vendor.mk </b>defaults to using <b>dpkg_vendor_derives_from_v1</b>
               for the <b>dpkg_vendor_derives_from </b>macro.  To restore the
               <b>v0 </b>behavior set <b>dpkg_vendor_derives_from </b>to
               <b>dpkg_vendor_derives_from_v0</b>.

           •   <b>default.mk </b>defaults to including <b>buildtools.mk</b>.

       v0  This is the current global level, equivalent to not
           specifying one.  The interfaces and behaviors provided are
           subject to the normal global interface updates, which tend to
           require longer deprecation cycles and/or coordinated
           transitions.
