NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dnf4.modularity - Modularity in DNF

       Modularity is new way of building, organizing and delivering
       packages.  For more details see:
       <i><a href="https://docs.pagure.org/modularity/">https://docs.pagure.org/modularity/</a> </i>
</pre> <h2>
DEFINITIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>modulemd</b>
              Every repository can contain <b>modules </b>metadata with
              modulemd documents.  These documents hold metadata about
              modules such as <b>Name</b>, <b>Stream </b>or list of packages.

       <b>(non-modular) package</b>
              Package that doesn't belong to a module.

       <b>modular package</b>
              Package that belongs to a module. It is listed in modulemd
              under the <b>artifacts </b>section.  Modular packages can be also
              identified by having <b>%{modularitylabel} </b>RPM header set.

       <b>(module) stream</b>
              Stream is a collection of packages, a virtual repository.
              It is identified with <b>Name </b>and <b>Stream </b>from modulemd
              separated with colon, for example "postgresql:9.6".

              Module streams can be <b>active </b>or <b>inactive</b>. <b>active </b>means the
              RPM packages from this stream are included in the set of
              available packages.  Packages from <b>inactive </b>streams are
              filtered out.  Streams are <b>active </b>either if marked as
              <b>default </b>or if they are explicitly <b>enabled </b>by a user
              action. Streams that satisfy dependencies of <b>default </b>or
              <b>enabled </b>streams are also considered <b>active</b>.  Only one
              stream of a particular module can be <b>active </b>at a given
              point in time.
</pre> <h2>
PACKAGE FILTERING </h2>
<pre>
       Without modules, packages with the highest version are used by
       default.

       Module streams can distribute packages with lower versions than
       available in the repositories available to the operating system.
       To make such packages available for installs and upgrades, the
       non-modular packages are filtered out when their name or provide
       matches against a modular package name from any enabled, default,
       or dependent stream. Modular source packages will not cause
       non-modular binary packages to be filtered out.

   <b>Demodularized rpms</b>
       Contains names of RPMs excluded from package filtering for
       particular module stream. When defined in the latest active
       module, non-modular RPMs with the same name or provide which were
       previously filtered out will reappear.
</pre> <h2>
HOTFIX REPOSITORIES </h2>
<pre>
       In special cases, a user wants to cherry-pick individual packages
       provided outside module streams and make them available on along
       with packages from the active streams.  Under normal
       circumstances, such packages are filtered out or rejected from
       getting on the system by Fail-safe mechanisms.  To make the
       system use packages from a repository regardless of their
       modularity, specify <b>module_hotfixes=true </b>in the .repo file. This
       protects the repository from package filtering.

       Please note the hotfix packages do not override module packages,
       they only become part of available package set. It's the package
       <b>Epoch</b>, <b>Version </b>and <b>Release </b>what determines if the package is the
       latest.
</pre> <h2>
FAIL-SAFE MECHANISMS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Repositories with module metadata are unavailable</b>
       When a repository with module metadata is unavailable, package
       filtering must keep working.  Non-modular RPMs must remain
       unavailable and must never get on the system.

       This happens when:

       • user disables a repository via <b>--disablerepo </b>or uses <b>--repoid</b>

       • user removes a .repo file from disk

       • repository is not available and has <b>skip_if_unavailable=true</b>

       DNF keeps copies of the latest modulemd for every active stream
       and uses them if there's no modulemd available for the stream.
       This keeps package filtering working correctly.

       The copies are made any time a transaction is resolved and
       started.  That includes RPM transactions as well as any <b>dnf</b>
       <b>module &lt;enable|disable|reset&gt; </b>operations.

       When the fail-safe data is used, dnf show such modules as part of
       @modulefailsafe repository.

   <b>Orphaned modular packages</b>
       All packages that are built as a part of a module have
       <b>%{modularitylabel} </b>RPM header set.  If such package becomes part
       of RPM transaction and cannot be associated with any available
       modulemd, DNF prevents from getting it on the system (package is
       available, but cannot be installed, upgraded, etc.). Packages
       from Hotfix repositories or Commandline repository are not
       affected by Fail-safe mechanisms.
