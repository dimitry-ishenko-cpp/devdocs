DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Generators are small executables placed in
       /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/ and other directories listed
       above.  <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> will execute these binaries very early at
       bootup and at configuration reload time — before unit files are
       loaded. Their main purpose is to convert configuration and
       execution context parameters that are not native to the service
       manager into dynamically generated unit files, symlinks or unit
       file drop-ins, so that they can extend the unit file hierarchy
       the service manager subsequently loads and operates on.

       <b>systemd </b>will call each generator with three directory paths that
       are to be used for generator output. In these three directories,
       generators may dynamically generate unit files (regular ones,
       instances, as well as templates), unit file .d/ drop-ins, and
       create symbolic links to unit files to add additional
       dependencies, create aliases, or instantiate existing templates.
       Those directories are included in the unit load path, allowing
       generated configuration to extend or override existing
       definitions. For tests, generators may be called with just one
       argument; the generator should assume that all three paths are
       the same in that case.

       Directory paths for generator output differ by priority:
       .../generator.early has priority higher than the admin
       configuration in /etc/, while .../generator has lower priority
       than /etc/ but higher than vendor configuration in /usr/, and
       .../generator.late has priority lower than all other
       configuration. See the next section and the discussion of unit
       load paths and unit overriding in <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>.

       Generators are loaded from a set of paths determined during
       compilation, as listed above. System and user generators are
       loaded from directories with names ending in system-generators/
       and user-generators/, respectively. Generators found in
       directories listed earlier override the ones with the same name
       in directories lower in the list [1]. A symlink to /dev/null or
       an empty file can be used to mask a generator, thereby preventing
       it from running. Please note that the order of the two
       directories with the highest priority is reversed with respect to
       the unit load path, and generators in /run/ overwrite those in
       /etc/.

       After installing new generators or updating the configuration,
       <b>systemctl daemon-reload </b>may be executed. This will delete the
       previous configuration created by generators, re-run all
       generators, and cause <b>systemd </b>to reload units from disk. See
       <a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a> for more information.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT DIRECTORIES </h2>
<pre>
       Generators are invoked with three arguments: paths to directories
       where generators can place their generated unit files or
       symlinks. By default those paths are runtime directories that are
       included in the search path of <b>systemd</b>, but a generator may be
       called with different paths for debugging purposes. If only one
       argument is provided, the generator should use the same directory
       as the three output paths.

        1. <i>normal-dir</i>

           In normal use this is /run/systemd/generator in case of the
           system generators and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/generator in
           case of the user generators. Unit files placed in this
           directory take precedence over vendor unit configuration but
           not over native user/administrator unit configuration.

        2. <i>early-dir</i>

           In normal use this is /run/systemd/generator.early in case of
           the system generators and
           $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/generator.early in case of the user
           generators. Unit files placed in this directory override unit
           files in /usr/, /run/ and /etc/. This means that unit files
           placed in this directory take precedence over all normal
           configuration, both vendor and user/administrator.

        3. <i>late-dir</i>

           In normal use this is /run/systemd/generator.late in case of
           the system generators and
           $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/generator.late in case of the user
           generators. This directory may be used to extend the unit
           file tree without overriding any other unit files. Any native
           configuration files supplied by the vendor or
           user/administrator take precedence.

       Note: generators <i>must not</i> write to other locations or otherwise
       make changes to system state. Generator output is supposed to
       last only until the next <b>daemon-reload </b>or <b>daemon-reexec</b>; if the
       generator is replaced or masked, its effects should vanish.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The service manager sets a number of environment variables when
       invoking generator executables. They carry information about the
       execution context of the generator, in order to simplify
       conditionalizing generators to specific environments. The
       following environment variables are set:

       <i>$SYSTEMD_SCOPE</i>
           If the generator is invoked from the system service manager
           this variable is set to "system"; if invoked from the
           per-user service manager it is set to "user".

           Added in version 251.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_IN_INITRD</i>
           If the generator is run as part of an initrd this is set to
           "1". If it is run from the regular host (i.e. after the
           transition from initrd to host) it is set to "0". This
           environment variable is only set for system generators.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_FIRST_BOOT</i>
           If this boot-up cycle is considered a "first boot", this is
           set to "1"; if it is a subsequent, regular boot it is set to
           "0". For details see the documentation of <i>ConditionFirstBoot=</i>
           in <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>. This environment variable is only set for
           system generators.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_VIRTUALIZATION</i>
           If the service manager is run in a virtualized environment,
           <i>$SYSTEMD_VIRTUALIZATION</i> is set to a pair of strings,
           separated by a colon. The first string is either "vm" or
           "container", categorizing the type of virtualization. The
           second string identifies the implementation of the
           virtualization technology. If no virtualization is detected
           this variable will not be set. This data is identical to what
           <a href="../man1/systemd-detect-virt.1.html">systemd-detect-virt(1)</a> detects and reports, and uses the same
           vocabulary of virtualization implementation identifiers.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_ARCHITECTURE</i>
           This variable is set to a short identifier of the reported
           architecture of the system. For details about defined values,
           see documentation of <i>ConditionArchitecture=</i> in
           <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>.

           Added in version 251.

       <i>$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</i>, <i>$ENCRYPTED_CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</i>
           If set, refers to the directory system credentials have been
           placed in. Credentials passed into the system in plaintext
           form will be placed in <i>$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</i>, and those
           passed in in encrypted form will be placed in
           <i>$ENCRYPTED_CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</i>. Use the <a href="../man1/systemd-creds.1.html">systemd-creds(1)</a>
           command to automatically decrypt/authenticate credentials
           passed in, if needed. Specifically, use the <b>systemd-creds</b>
           <b>--system cat </b>command.

           Added in version 254.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_CONFIDENTIAL_VIRTUALIZATION</i>
           If the service manager is run in a confidential virtualized
           environment, <i>$SYSTEMD_CONFIDENTIAL_VIRTUALIZATION</i> is set to a
           string that identifies the confidential virtualization
           hardware technology. If no confidential virtualization is
           detected this variable will not be set. This data is
           identical to what <a href="../man1/systemd-detect-virt.1.html">systemd-detect-virt(1)</a> detects and reports,
           and uses the same vocabulary of confidential virtualization
           technology identifiers.

           Added in version 254.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES ABOUT WRITING GENERATORS </h2>
<pre>
       •   All generators are executed in parallel. That means all
           executables are started at the very same time and need to be
           able to cope with this parallelism.

       •   Generators are run very early at boot and cannot rely on any
           external services. They may not talk to any other process.
           That includes simple things such as logging to <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>, or
           <b>systemd </b>itself (this means: no <a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a>)! Non-essential
           file systems like /var/ and /home/ are mounted after
           generators have run. Generators can however rely on the most
           basic kernel functionality to be available, as well as
           mounted /sys/, /proc/, /dev/, /usr/ and /run/ file systems.

       •   Units written by generators are removed when the
           configuration is reloaded. That means the lifetime of the
           generated units is closely bound to the reload cycles of
           <b>systemd </b>itself.

       •   Generators should only be used to generate unit files,
           .d/*.conf drop-ins for them and symlinks to them, not any
           other kind of non-unit related configuration. Due to the
           lifecycle logic mentioned above, generators are not a good
           fit to generate dynamic configuration for other services. If
           you need to generate dynamic configuration for other
           services, do so in normal services you order before the
           service in question.

           Note that using the <i>StandardInputData=</i>/<i>StandardInputText=</i>
           settings of service unit files (see <a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a>), it is
           possible to make arbitrary input data (including
           daemon-specific configuration) part of the unit definitions,
           which often might be sufficient to embed data or
           configuration for other programs into unit files in a native
           fashion.

       •   Since <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a> is not available (see above), log messages
           have to be written to /dev/kmsg instead.

       •   The generator should always include its own name in a comment
           at the top of the generated file, so that the user can easily
           figure out which component created or amended a particular
           unit.

           The <i>SourcePath=</i> directive should be used in generated files
           to specify the source configuration file they are generated
           from. This makes things more easily understood by the user
           and also has the benefit that systemd can warn the user about
           configuration files that changed on disk but have not been
           read yet by systemd. The <i>SourcePath=</i> value does not have to
           be a file in a physical filesystem. For example, in the
           common case of the generator looking at the kernel command
           line, <b>SourcePath=/proc/cmdline </b>should be used.

       •   Generators may write out dynamic unit files or just hook unit
           files into other units with the usual .wants/ or .requires/
           symlinks. Often, it is nicer to simply instantiate a template
           unit file from /usr/ with a generator instead of writing out
           entirely dynamic unit files. Of course, this works only if a
           single parameter is to be used.

       •   If you are careful, you can implement generators in shell
           scripts. We do recommend C code however, since generators are
           executed synchronously and hence delay the entire boot if
           they are slow.

       •   Regarding overriding semantics: there are two rules we try to
           follow when thinking about the overriding semantics:

            1. User configuration should override vendor configuration.
               This (mostly) means that stuff from /etc/ should override
               stuff from /usr/.

            2. Native configuration should override non-native
               configuration. This (mostly) means that stuff you
               generate should never override native unit files for the
               same purpose.

           Of these two rules the first rule is probably the more
           important one and breaks the second one sometimes. Hence,
           when deciding whether to use argv[1], argv[2], or argv[3],
           your default choice should probably be argv[1].

       •   Instead of heading off now and writing all kind of generators
           for legacy configuration file formats, please think twice! It
           is often a better idea to just deprecate old stuff instead of
           keeping it artificially alive.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Example 1. systemd-fstab-generator</b>

       <a href="../man8/systemd-fstab-generator.8.html">systemd-fstab-generator(8)</a> converts /etc/fstab into native mount
       units. It uses argv[1] as location to place the generated unit
       files in order to allow the user to override /etc/fstab with
       their own native unit files, but also to ensure that /etc/fstab
       overrides any vendor default from /usr/.

       After editing /etc/fstab, the user should invoke <b>systemctl</b>
       <b>daemon-reload</b>. This will re-run all generators and cause <b>systemd</b>
       to reload units from disk. To actually mount new directories
       added to fstab, <b>systemctl start </b><i>/path/to/mountpoint</i> or <b>systemctl</b>
       <b>start local-fs.target </b>may be used.

       <b>Example 2. systemd-system-update-generator</b>

       <a href="../man8/systemd-system-update-generator.8.html">systemd-system-update-generator(8)</a> temporarily redirects
       default.target to system-update.target, if a system update is
       scheduled. Since this needs to override the default user
       configuration for default.target, it uses argv[2]. For details
       about this logic, see <a href="systemd.offline-updates.7.html">systemd.offline-updates(7)</a>.

       <b>Example 3. Debugging a generator</b>

           dir=$(mktemp -d)
           SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-fstab-generator \
                   "$dir" "$dir" "$dir"
