NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fanotify - monitoring filesystem events
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The fanotify API provides notification and interception of
       filesystem events.  Use cases include virus scanning and
       hierarchical storage management.  In the original fanotify API,
       only a limited set of events was supported.  In particular, there
       was no support for create, delete, and move events.  The support
       for those events was added in Linux 5.1.  (See <a href="inotify.7.html">inotify(7)</a> for
       details of an API that did notify those events pre Linux 5.1.)

       Additional capabilities compared to the <a href="inotify.7.html">inotify(7)</a> API include
       the ability to monitor all of the objects in a mounted
       filesystem, the ability to make access permission decisions, and
       the possibility to read or modify files before access by other
       applications.

       The following system calls are used with this API:
       <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>, and
       <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>.

   <b>fanotify_init(), fanotify_mark(), and notification groups</b>
       The <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a> system call creates and initializes an
       fanotify notification group and returns a file descriptor
       referring to it.

       An fanotify notification group is a kernel-internal object that
       holds a list of files, directories, filesystems, and mounts for
       which events shall be created.

       For each entry in an fanotify notification group, two bit masks
       exist: the <i>mark</i> mask and the <i>ignore</i> mask.  The mark mask defines
       file activities for which an event shall be created.  The ignore
       mask defines activities for which no event shall be generated.
       Having these two types of masks permits a filesystem, mount, or
       directory to be marked for receiving events, while at the same
       time ignoring events for specific objects under a mount or
       directory.

       The <a href="../man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a> system call adds a file, directory,
       filesystem, or mount to a notification group and specifies which
       events shall be reported (or ignored), or removes or modifies
       such an entry.

       A possible usage of the ignore mask is for a file cache.  Events
       of interest for a file cache are modification of a file and
       closing of the same.  Hence, the cached directory or mount is to
       be marked to receive these events.  After receiving the first
       event informing that a file has been modified, the corresponding
       cache entry will be invalidated.  No further modification events
       for this file are of interest until the file is closed.  Hence,
       the modify event can be added to the ignore mask.  Upon receiving
       the close event, the modify event can be removed from the ignore
       mask and the file cache entry can be updated.

       The entries in the fanotify notification groups refer to files
       and directories via their inode number and to mounts via their
       mount ID.  If files or directories are renamed or moved within
       the same mount, the respective entries survive.  If files or
       directories are deleted or moved to another mount or if
       filesystems or mounts are unmounted, the corresponding entries
       are deleted.

   <b>The event queue</b>
       As events occur on the filesystem objects monitored by a
       notification group, the fanotify system generates events that are
       collected in a queue.  These events can then be read (using
       <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> or similar) from the fanotify file descriptor returned by
       <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>.

       Two types of events are generated: <i>notification</i> events and
       <i>permission</i> events.  Notification events are merely informative
       and require no action to be taken by the receiving application
       with one exception: if a valid file descriptor is provided within
       a generic event, the file descriptor must be closed.  Permission
       events are requests to the receiving application to decide
       whether permission for a file access shall be granted.  For these
       events, the recipient must write a response which decides whether
       access is granted or not.

       An event is removed from the event queue of the fanotify group
       when it has been read.  Permission events that have been read are
       kept in an internal list of the fanotify group until either a
       permission decision has been taken by writing to the fanotify
       file descriptor or the fanotify file descriptor is closed.

   <b>Reading fanotify events</b>
       Calling <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> for the file descriptor returned by
       <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a> blocks (if the flag <b>FAN_NONBLOCK </b>is not
       specified in the call to <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>) until either a file
       event occurs or the call is interrupted by a signal (see
       <a href="signal.7.html">signal(7)</a>).

       After a successful <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, the read buffer contains one or more
       of the following structures:

           struct fanotify_event_metadata {
               __u32 event_len;
               __u8 vers;
               __u8 reserved;
               __u16 metadata_len;
               __aligned_u64 mask;
               __s32 fd;
               __s32 pid;
           };

       Information records are supplemental pieces of information that
       may be provided alongside the generic <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i>
       structure.  The <i>flags</i> passed to <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a> have influence
       over the type of information records that may be returned for an
       event.  For example, if a notification group is initialized with
       <b>FAN_REPORT_FID </b>or <b>FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID</b>, then event listeners should
       also expect to receive a <i>fanotify_event_info_fid</i> structure
       alongside the <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure, whereby file
       handles are used to identify filesystem objects rather than file
       descriptors.  Information records may also be stacked, meaning
       that using the various <b>FAN_REPORT_* </b>flags in conjunction with one
       another is supported.  In such cases, multiple information
       records can be returned for an event alongside the generic
       <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure.  For example, if a
       notification group is initialized with <b>FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID </b>and
       <b>FAN_REPORT_PIDFD</b>, then an event listener should expect to receive
       up to two <i>fanotify_event_info_fid</i> information records and one
       <i>fanotify_event_info_pidfd</i> information record alongside the
       generic <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure.  Importantly, fanotify
       provides no guarantee around the ordering of information records
       when a notification group is initialized with a stacked based
       configuration.  Each information record has a nested structure of
       type <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i>.  It is imperative for event
       listeners to inspect the <i>info_type</i> field of this structure in
       order to determine the type of information record that had been
       received for a given event.

       In cases where an fanotify group identifies filesystem objects by
       file handles, event listeners should also expect to receive one
       or more of the below information record objects alongside the
       generic <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure within the read buffer:

           struct fanotify_event_info_fid {
               struct fanotify_event_info_header hdr;
               __kernel_fsid_t fsid;
               unsigned char handle[];
           };

       In cases where an fanotify group is initialized with
       <b>FAN_REPORT_PIDFD</b>, event listeners should expect to receive the
       below information record object alongside the generic
       <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure within the read buffer:

           struct fanotify_event_info_pidfd {
                   struct fanotify_event_info_header hdr;
                   __s32 pidfd;
           };

       In case of a <b>FAN_FS_ERROR </b>event, an additional information record
       describing the error that occurred is returned alongside the
       generic <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure within the read buffer.
       This structure is defined as follows:

           struct fanotify_event_info_error {
               struct fanotify_event_info_header hdr;
               __s32 error;
               __u32 error_count;
           };

       All information records contain a nested structure of type
       <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i>.  This structure holds meta-
       information about the information record that may have been
       returned alongside the generic <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure.
       This structure is defined as follows:

           struct fanotify_event_info_header {
                __u8 info_type;
                __u8 pad;
                __u16 len;
           };

       For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a large buffer
       size (for example, 4096 bytes), so that multiple events can be
       retrieved by a single <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>.

       The return value of <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> is the number of bytes placed in the
       buffer, or -1 in case of an error (but see BUGS).

       The fields of the <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure are as
       follows:

       <i>event_len</i>
              This is the length of the data for the current event and
              the offset to the next event in the buffer.  Unless the
              group identifies filesystem objects by file handles, the
              value of <i>event_len</i> is always <b>FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN</b>.  For
              a group that identifies filesystem objects by file
              handles, <i>event_len</i> also includes the variable length file
              identifier records.

       <i>vers</i>   This field holds a version number for the structure.  It
              must be compared to <b>FANOTIFY_METADATA_VERSION </b>to verify
              that the structures returned at run time match the
              structures defined at compile time.  In case of a
              mismatch, the application should abandon trying to use the
              fanotify file descriptor.

       <i>reserved</i>
              This field is not used.

       <i>metadata_len</i>
              This is the length of the structure.  The field was
              introduced to facilitate the implementation of optional
              headers per event type.  No such optional headers exist in
              the current implementation.

       <i>mask</i>   This is a bit mask describing the event (see below).

       <i>fd</i>     This is an open file descriptor for the object being
              accessed, or <b>FAN_NOFD </b>if a queue overflow occurred.  With
              an fanotify group that identifies filesystem objects by
              file handles, applications should expect this value to be
              set to <b>FAN_NOFD </b>for each event that is received.  The file
              descriptor can be used to access the contents of the
              monitored file or directory.  The reading application is
              responsible for closing this file descriptor.

              When calling <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>, the caller may specify (via
              the <i>event_f_flags</i> argument) various file status flags that
              are to be set on the open file description that
              corresponds to this file descriptor.  In addition, the
              (kernel-internal) <b>FMODE_NONOTIFY </b>file status flag is set
              on the open file description.  This flag suppresses
              fanotify event generation.  Hence, when the receiver of
              the fanotify event accesses the notified file or directory
              using this file descriptor, no additional events will be
              created.

       <i>pid</i>    If flag <b>FAN_REPORT_TID </b>was set in <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>, this
              is the TID of the thread that caused the event.
              Otherwise, this the PID of the process that caused the
              event.

       A program listening to fanotify events can compare this PID to
       the PID returned by <a href="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid(2)</a>, to determine whether the event is
       caused by the listener itself, or is due to a file access by
       another process.

       The bit mask in <i>mask</i> indicates which events have occurred for a
       single filesystem object.  Multiple bits may be set in this mask,
       if more than one event occurred for the monitored filesystem
       object.  In particular, consecutive events for the same
       filesystem object and originating from the same process may be
       merged into a single event, with the exception that two
       permission events are never merged into one queue entry.

       The bits that may appear in <i>mask</i> are as follows:

       <b>FAN_ACCESS</b>
              A file or a directory (but see BUGS) was accessed (read).

       <b>FAN_OPEN</b>
              A file or a directory was opened.

       <b>FAN_OPEN_EXEC</b>
              A file was opened with the intent to be executed.  See
              NOTES in <a href="../man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a> for additional details.

       <b>FAN_ATTRIB</b>
              A file or directory metadata was changed.

       <b>FAN_CREATE</b>
              A child file or directory was created in a watched parent.

       <b>FAN_DELETE</b>
              A child file or directory was deleted in a watched parent.

       <b>FAN_DELETE_SELF</b>
              A watched file or directory was deleted.

       <b>FAN_FS_ERROR</b>
              A filesystem error was detected.

       <b>FAN_RENAME</b>
              A file or directory has been moved to or from a watched
              parent directory.

       <b>FAN_MOVED_FROM</b>
              A file or directory has been moved from a watched parent
              directory.

       <b>FAN_MOVED_TO</b>
              A file or directory has been moved to a watched parent
              directory.

       <b>FAN_MOVE_SELF</b>
              A watched file or directory was moved.

       <b>FAN_MODIFY</b>
              A file was modified.

       <b>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</b>
              A file that was opened for writing (<b>O_WRONLY </b>or <b>O_RDWR</b>)
              was closed.

       <b>FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</b>
              A file or directory that was opened read-only (<b>O_RDONLY</b>)
              was closed.

       <b>FAN_Q_OVERFLOW</b>
              The event queue exceeded the limit on number of events.
              This limit can be overridden by specifying the
              <b>FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE </b>flag when calling <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>.

       <b>FAN_ACCESS_PERM</b>
              An application wants to read a file or directory, for
              example using <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/readdir.2.html">readdir(2)</a>.  The reader must
              write a response (as described below) that determines
              whether the permission to access the filesystem object
              shall be granted.

       <b>FAN_OPEN_PERM</b>
              An application wants to open a file or directory.  The
              reader must write a response that determines whether the
              permission to open the filesystem object shall be granted.

       <b>FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM</b>
              An application wants to open a file for execution.  The
              reader must write a response that determines whether the
              permission to open the filesystem object for execution
              shall be granted.  See NOTES in <a href="../man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a> for
              additional details.

       To check for any close event, the following bit mask may be used:

       <b>FAN_CLOSE</b>
              A file was closed.  This is a synonym for:

                  FAN_CLOSE_WRITE | FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE

       To check for any move event, the following bit mask may be used:

       <b>FAN_MOVE</b>
              A file or directory was moved.  This is a synonym for:

                  FAN_MOVED_FROM | FAN_MOVED_TO

       The following bits may appear in <i>mask</i> only in conjunction with
       other event type bits:

       <b>FAN_ONDIR</b>
              The events described in the <i>mask</i> have occurred on a
              directory object.  Reporting events on directories
              requires setting this flag in the mark mask.  See
              <a href="../man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a> for additional details.  The <b>FAN_ONDIR</b>
              flag is reported in an event mask only if the fanotify
              group identifies filesystem objects by file handles.

       Information records that are supplied alongside the generic
       <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure will always contain a nested
       structure of type <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i>.  The fields of the
       <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i> are as follows:

       <i>info_type</i>
              A unique integer value representing the type of
              information record object received for an event.  The
              value of this field can be set to one of the following:
              <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</b>, <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</b>,
              <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</b>, or
              <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_PIDFD</b>.  The value set for this field
              is dependent on the flags that have been supplied to
              <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>.  Refer to the field details of each
              information record object type below to understand the
              different cases in which the <i>info_type</i> values can be set.

       <i>pad</i>    This field is currently not used by any information record
              object type and therefore is set to zero.

       <i>len</i>    The value of <i>len</i> is set to the size of the information
              record object, including the <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i>.
              The total size of all additional information records is
              not expected to be larger than (<i>event_len</i> - <i>metadata_len</i>).

       The fields of the <i>fanotify_event_info_fid</i> structure are as
       follows:

       <i>hdr</i>    This is a structure of type <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i>.
              For example, when an fanotify file descriptor is created
              using <b>FAN_REPORT_FID</b>, a single information record is
              expected to be attached to the event with <i>info_type</i> field
              value of <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</b>.  When an fanotify file
              descriptor is created using the combination of
              <b>FAN_REPORT_FID </b>and <b>FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID</b>, there may be two
              information records attached to the event: one with
              <i>info_type</i> field value of <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</b>,
              identifying a parent directory object, and one with
              <i>info_type</i> field value of <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</b>,
              identifying a child object.  Note that for the directory
              entry modification events <b>FAN_CREATE</b>, <b>FAN_DELETE</b>,
              <b>FAN_MOVE</b>, and <b>FAN_RENAME</b>, an information record
              identifying the created/deleted/moved child object is
              reported only if an fanotify group was initialized with
              the flag <b>FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID</b>.

       <i>fsid</i>   This is a unique identifier of the filesystem containing
              the object associated with the event.  It is a structure
              of type <i>__kernel_fsid_t</i> and contains the same value as
              <i>f_fsid</i> when calling <a href="../man2/statfs.2.html">statfs(2)</a>.

       <i>handle</i> This field contains a variable-length structure of type
              <i>struct file_handle</i>.  It is an opaque handle that
              corresponds to a specified object on a filesystem as
              returned by <a href="../man2/name_to_handle_at.2.html">name_to_handle_at(2)</a>.  It can be used to
              uniquely identify a file on a filesystem and can be passed
              as an argument to <a href="../man2/open_by_handle_at.2.html">open_by_handle_at(2)</a>.  If the value of
              <i>info_type</i> field is <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</b>, the file
              handle is followed by a null terminated string that
              identifies the created/deleted/moved directory entry name.
              For other events such as <b>FAN_OPEN</b>, <b>FAN_ATTRIB</b>,
              <b>FAN_DELETE_SELF</b>, and <b>FAN_MOVE_SELF</b>, if the value of
              <i>info_type</i> field is <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</b>, the <i>handle</i>
              identifies the object correlated to the event.  If the
              value of <i>info_type</i> field is <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</b>, the
              <i>handle</i> identifies the directory object correlated to the
              event or the parent directory of a non-directory object
              correlated to the event.  If the value of <i>info_type</i> field
              is <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</b>, the <i>handle</i> identifies
              the same directory object that would be reported with
              <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID </b>and the file handle is followed
              by a null terminated string that identifies the name of a
              directory entry in that directory, or '.' to identify the
              directory object itself.

       The fields of the <i>fanotify_event_info_pidfd</i> structure are as
       follows:

       <i>hdr</i>    This is a structure of type <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i>.
              When an fanotify group is initialized using
              <b>FAN_REPORT_PIDFD</b>, the <i>info_type</i> field value of the
              <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i> is set to
              <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_PIDFD</b>.

       <i>pidfd</i>  This is a process file descriptor that refers to the
              process responsible for generating the event.  The
              returned process file descriptor is no different from one
              which could be obtained manually if <a href="../man2/pidfd_open.2.html">pidfd_open(2)</a> were to
              be called on <i>fanotify_event_metadata.pid</i>.  In the instance
              that an error is encountered during pidfd creation, one of
              two possible error types represented by a negative integer
              value may be returned in this <i>pidfd</i> field.  In cases where
              the process responsible for generating the event has
              terminated prior to the event listener being able to read
              events from the notification queue, <b>FAN_NOPIDFD </b>is
              returned.  The pidfd creation for an event is only
              performed at the time the events are read from the
              notification queue.  All other possible pidfd creation
              failures are represented by <b>FAN_EPIDFD</b>.  Once the event
              listener has dealt with an event and the pidfd is no
              longer required, the pidfd should be closed via <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>.

       The fields of the <i>fanotify_event_info_error</i> structure are as
       follows:

       <i>hdr</i>    This is a structure of type <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i>.
              The <i>info_type</i> field is set to <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_ERROR</b>.

       <i>error</i>  Identifies the type of error that occurred.

       <i>error_count</i>
              This is a counter of the number of errors suppressed since
              the last error was read.

       The following macros are provided to iterate over a buffer
       containing fanotify event metadata returned by a <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> from an
       fanotify file descriptor:

       <b>FAN_EVENT_OK(meta, len)</b>
              This macro checks the remaining length <i>len</i> of the buffer
              <i>meta</i> against the length of the metadata structure and the
              <i>event_len</i> field of the first metadata structure in the
              buffer.

       <b>FAN_EVENT_NEXT(meta, len)</b>
              This macro uses the length indicated in the <i>event_len</i>
              field of the metadata structure pointed to by <i>meta</i> to
              calculate the address of the next metadata structure that
              follows <i>meta</i>.  <i>len</i> is the number of bytes of metadata that
              currently remain in the buffer.  The macro returns a
              pointer to the next metadata structure that follows <i>meta</i>,
              and reduces <i>len</i> by the number of bytes in the metadata
              structure that has been skipped over (i.e., it subtracts
              <i>meta-&gt;event_len</i> from <i>len</i>).

       In addition, there is:

       <b>FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN</b>
              This macro returns the size (in bytes) of the structure
              <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i>.  This is the minimum size (and
              currently the only size) of any event metadata.

   <b>Monitoring an fanotify file descriptor for events</b>
       When an fanotify event occurs, the fanotify file descriptor
       indicates as readable when passed to <a href="epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>, <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, or
       <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>.

   <b>Dealing with permission events</b>
       For permission events, the application must <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> a structure
       of the following form to the fanotify file descriptor:

           struct fanotify_response {
               __s32 fd;
               __u32 response;
           };

       The fields of this structure are as follows:

       <i>fd</i>     This is the file descriptor from the structure
              <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i>.

       <i>response</i>
              This field indicates whether or not the permission is to
              be granted.  Its value must be either <b>FAN_ALLOW </b>to allow
              the file operation or <b>FAN_DENY </b>to deny the file operation.

       If access is denied, the requesting application call will receive
       an <b>EPERM </b>error.  Additionally, if the notification group has been
       created with the <b>FAN_ENABLE_AUDIT </b>flag, then the <b>FAN_AUDIT </b>flag
       can be set in the <i>response</i> field.  In that case, the audit
       subsystem will log information about the access decision to the
       audit logs.

   <b>Monitoring filesystems for errors</b>
       A single <b>FAN_FS_ERROR </b>event is stored per filesystem at once.
       Extra error messages are suppressed and accounted for in the
       <i>error_count</i> field of the existing <b>FAN_FS_ERROR </b>event record, but
       details about the errors are lost.

       Errors reported by <b>FAN_FS_ERROR </b>are generic <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> values, but not
       all kinds of error types are reported by all filesystems.

       Errors not directly related to a file (i.e. super block
       corruption) are reported with an invalid <i>handle</i>.  For these
       errors, the <i>handle</i> will have the field <i>handle_type</i> set to
       <b>FILEID_INVALID</b>, and the handle buffer size set to <b>0</b>.

   <b>Closing the fanotify file descriptor</b>
       When all file descriptors referring to the fanotify notification
       group are closed, the fanotify group is released and its
       resources are freed for reuse by the kernel.  Upon <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>,
       outstanding permission events will be set to allowed.

   <b>/proc interfaces</b>
       The file <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fdinfo/</i>fd contains information about fanotify
       marks for file descriptor <i>fd</i> of process <i>pid</i>.  See <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> for
       details.

       Since Linux 5.13, the following interfaces can be used to control
       the amount of kernel resources consumed by fanotify:

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/fanotify/max_queued_events</i>
              The value in this file is used when an application calls
              <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a> to set an upper limit on the number of
              events that can be queued to the corresponding fanotify
              group.  Events in excess of this limit are dropped, but an
              <b>FAN_Q_OVERFLOW </b>event is always generated.  Prior to Linux
              kernel 5.13, the hardcoded limit was 16384 events.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/fanotify/max_user_group</i>
              This specifies an upper limit on the number of fanotify
              groups that can be created per real user ID.  Prior to
              Linux kernel 5.13, the hardcoded limit was 128 groups per
              user.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/fanotify/max_user_marks</i>
              This specifies an upper limit on the number of fanotify
              marks that can be created per real user ID.  Prior to
              Linux kernel 5.13, the hardcoded limit was 8192 marks per
              group (not per user).

ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to the usual errors for <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, the following errors
       can occur when reading from the fanotify file descriptor:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The buffer is too small to hold the event.

       <b>EMFILE </b>The per-process limit on the number of open files has been
              reached.  See the description of <b>RLIMIT_NOFILE </b>in
              <a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit(2)</a>.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
              has been reached.  See <i>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</i> in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              This error is returned by <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> if <b>O_RDWR </b>or <b>O_WRONLY</b>
              was specified in the <i>event_f_flags</i> argument when calling
              <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a> and an event occurred for a monitored
              file that is currently being executed.

       In addition to the usual errors for <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>, the following
       errors can occur when writing to the fanotify file descriptor:

       <b>EINVAL </b>Fanotify access permissions are not enabled in the kernel
              configuration or the value of <i>response</i> in the response
              structure is not valid.

       <b>ENOENT </b>The file descriptor <i>fd</i> in the response structure is not
              valid.  This may occur when a response for the permission
              event has already been written.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       Linux.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       The fanotify API was introduced in Linux 2.6.36 and enabled in
       Linux 2.6.37.  fdinfo support was added in Linux 3.8.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The fanotify API is available only if the kernel was built with
       the <b>CONFIG_FANOTIFY </b>configuration option enabled.  In addition,
       fanotify permission handling is available only if the
       <b>CONFIG_FANOTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS </b>configuration option is
       enabled.

   <b>Limitations and caveats</b>
       Fanotify reports only events that a user-space program triggers
       through the filesystem API.  As a result, it does not catch
       remote events that occur on network filesystems.

       The fanotify API does not report file accesses and modifications
       that may occur because of <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/msync.2.html">msync(2)</a>, and <a href="../man2/munmap.2.html">munmap(2)</a>.

       Events for directories are created only if the directory itself
       is opened, read, and closed.  Adding, removing, or changing
       children of a marked directory does not create events for the
       monitored directory itself.

       Fanotify monitoring of directories is not recursive: to monitor
       subdirectories under a directory, additional marks must be
       created.  The <b>FAN_CREATE </b>event can be used for detecting when a
       subdirectory has been created under a marked directory.  An
       additional mark must then be set on the newly created
       subdirectory.  This approach is racy, because it can lose events
       that occurred inside the newly created subdirectory, before a
       mark is added on that subdirectory.  Monitoring mounts offers the
       capability to monitor a whole directory tree in a race-free
       manner.  Monitoring filesystems offers the capability to monitor
       changes made from any mount of a filesystem instance in a race-
       free manner.

       The event queue can overflow.  In this case, events are lost.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Before Linux 3.19, <a href="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate(2)</a> did not generate fanotify events.
       Since Linux 3.19, calls to <a href="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate(2)</a> generate <b>FAN_MODIFY</b>
       events.

       As of Linux 3.17, the following bugs exist:

       •  On Linux, a filesystem object may be accessible through
          multiple paths, for example, a part of a filesystem may be
          remounted using the <i>--bind</i> option of <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>.  A listener
          that marked a mount will be notified only of events that were
          triggered for a filesystem object using the same mount.  Any
          other event will pass unnoticed.

       •  When an event is generated, no check is made to see whether
          the user ID of the receiving process has authorization to read
          or write the file before passing a file descriptor for that
          file.  This poses a security risk, when the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>
          capability is set for programs executed by unprivileged users.

       •  If a call to <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> processes multiple events from the
          fanotify queue and an error occurs, the return value will be
          the total length of the events successfully copied to the
          user-space buffer before the error occurred.  The return value
          will not be -1, and <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> will not be set.  Thus, the reading
          application has no way to detect the error.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The two example programs below demonstrate the usage of the
       fanotify API.

   <b>Example program: fanotify_example.c</b>
       The first program is an example of fanotify being used with its
       event object information passed in the form of a file descriptor.
       The program marks the mount passed as a command-line argument and
       waits for events of type <b>FAN_OPEN_PERM </b>and <b>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</b>.  When
       a permission event occurs, a <b>FAN_ALLOW </b>response is given.

       The following shell session shows an example of running this
       program.  This session involved editing the file
       <i>/home/user/temp/notes</i>.  Before the file was opened, a
       <b>FAN_OPEN_PERM </b>event occurred.  After the file was closed, a
       <b>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE </b>event occurred.  Execution of the program ends
       when the user presses the ENTER key.

           # <b>./fanotify_example /home</b>
           Press enter key to terminate.
           Listening for events.
           FAN_OPEN_PERM: File /home/user/temp/notes
           FAN_CLOSE_WRITE: File /home/user/temp/notes

           Listening for events stopped.

   <b>Example program: fanotify_fid.c</b>
       The second program is an example of fanotify being used with a
       group that identifies objects by file handles.  The program marks
       the filesystem object that is passed as a command-line argument
       and waits until an event of type <b>FAN_CREATE </b>has occurred.  The
       event mask indicates which type of filesystem object—either a
       file or a directory—was created.  Once all events have been read
       from the buffer and processed accordingly, the program simply
       terminates.

       The following shell sessions show two different invocations of
       this program, with different actions performed on a watched
       object.

       The first session shows a mark being placed on <i>/home/user</i>.  This
       is followed by the creation of a regular file,
       <i>/home/user/testfile.txt</i>.  This results in a <b>FAN_CREATE </b>event
       being generated and reported against the file's parent watched
       directory object and with the created file name.  Program
       execution ends once all events captured within the buffer have
       been processed.

           # <b>./fanotify_fid /home/user</b>
           Listening for events.
           FAN_CREATE (file created):
                   Directory /home/user has been modified.
                   Entry 'testfile.txt' is not a subdirectory.
           All events processed successfully. Program exiting.

           $ <b>touch /home/user/testfile.txt              </b># In another terminal

       The second session shows a mark being placed on <i>/home/user</i>.  This
       is followed by the creation of a directory, <i>/home/user/testdir</i>.
       This specific action results in a <b>FAN_CREATE </b>event being
       generated and is reported with the <b>FAN_ONDIR </b>flag set and with
       the created directory name.

           # <b>./fanotify_fid /home/user</b>
           Listening for events.
           FAN_CREATE | FAN_ONDIR (subdirectory created):
                   Directory /home/user has been modified.
                   Entry 'testdir' is a subdirectory.
           All events processed successfully. Program exiting.
