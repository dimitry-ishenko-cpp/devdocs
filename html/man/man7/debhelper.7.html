NAME </h2>
<pre>
       debhelper - the debhelper tool suite
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_</b><i>*</i> [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-i</b>] [<b>--no-act</b>] [<b>-p</b><i>package</i>] [<b>-N</b><i>package</i>] [<b>-P</b><i>tmpdir</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Debhelper is used to help you build a Debian package. The
       philosophy behind debhelper is to provide a collection of small,
       simple, and easily understood tools that are used in <i>debian/rules</i>
       to automate various common aspects of building a package. This
       means less work for you, the packager.  It also, to some degree
       means that these tools can be changed if Debian policy changes,
       and packages that use them will require only a rebuild to comply
       with the new policy.

       A typical <i>debian/rules</i> file that uses debhelper will call several
       debhelper commands in sequence, or use <a href="../man1/dh.1.html">dh(1)</a> to automate this
       process. Examples of rules files that use debhelper are in
       <i>/usr/share/doc/debhelper/examples/</i>

       To create a new Debian package using debhelper, you can just copy
       one of the sample rules files and edit it by hand. Or you can try
       the <b>dh-make </b>package, which contains a dh_make command that
       partially automates the process. For a more gentle introduction,
       the <b>maint-guide </b>Debian package contains a tutorial about making
       your first package using debhelper.

       Except where the tool explicitly denotes otherwise, all of the
       debhelper tools assume that they run from the root directory of
       an unpacked source package.  This is so they can locate find
       files like <i>debian/control</i> when needed.

   <b>Other Commands</b>
       If a program's name starts with <b>dh_</b>, and the program is not on
       the above lists, then it is not part of the debhelper package,
       but it should still work like the other programs described on
       this page.
</pre> <h2>
DEBHELPER CONFIG FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Many debhelper commands make use of files in <i>debian/</i> to control
       what they do. Besides the common <i>debian/changelog</i> and
       <i>debian/control</i>, which are in all packages, not just those using
       debhelper, some additional files can be used to configure the
       behavior of specific debhelper commands. These files are
       typically named debian/<i>package</i>.foo (where <i>package</i> of course, is
       replaced with the package that is being acted on).

       For example, <b>dh_installdocs </b>uses files named <i>debian/package.docs</i>
       to list the documentation files it will install. See the man
       pages of individual commands for details about the names and
       formats of the files they use.  Generally, these files will list
       files to act on, one file per line. Some programs in debhelper
       use pairs of files and destinations or slightly more complicated
       formats.

       Note if there is only one binary package listed in
       <i>debian/control</i>, then debhelper will use <i>debian/foo</i> when there's
       no <i>debian/package.foo</i> file.  In compat levels before compat 15,
       this fallback also occurs for the first binary package listed in
       <i>debian/control</i> when there are multiple binary packages. However,
       it is often a good idea to keep the <i>package.</i> prefix as it is more
       explicit and also required when upgrading to compat 15.

       Additionally, there are some special cases where debhelper will
       always fallback to a prefix-less version.  These are cases such
       as <i>debian/copyright</i> and <i>debian/changelog</i>, where the files are
       generally used and needed for all binary packages.

       In some rare cases, you may want to have different versions of
       these files for different architectures or OSes. If files named
       debian/<i>package</i>.foo.<i>ARCH</i> or debian/<i>package</i>.foo.<i>OS</i> exist, where
       <i>ARCH</i> and <i>OS</i> are the same as the output of "<b>dpkg-architecture</b>
       <b>-qDEB_HOST_ARCH</b>" / "<b>dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_ARCH_OS</b>", then
       they will be used in preference to other, more general files.

       Mostly, these config files are used to specify lists of various
       types of files. Documentation or example files to install, files
       to move, and so on.  When appropriate, in cases like these, you
       can use standard shell wildcard characters (<b>? </b>and <b>* </b>and <b>[</b><i>..</i><b>]</b>
       character classes) in the files.  You can also put comments in
       these files; lines beginning with <b># </b>are ignored.

       The syntax of these files is intentionally kept very simple to
       make them easy to read, understand, and modify.

   <b>Substitutions in debhelper config files</b>
       In compatibility level 13 and later, it is possible to use simple
       substitutions in debhelper config files for the following tools:

       â€¢   dh_clean

       â€¢   dh_install

       â€¢   dh_installcatalogs

       â€¢   dh_installdeb

       â€¢   dh_installdirs

       â€¢   dh_installdocs

       â€¢   dh_installexamples

       â€¢   dh_installinfo

       â€¢   dh_installman

       â€¢   dh_installwm

       â€¢   dh_link

       â€¢   dh_missing

       â€¢   dh_ucf

       All substitution variables are of the form <i>${foo}</i> and the braces
       are mandatory.  Variable names are case-sensitive and consist of
       alphanumerics (a-zA-Z0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and
       colons (:).  The first character must be an alphanumeric.

       If you need a literal dollar sign that cannot trigger a
       substitution, you can either use the <b>${Dollar} </b>substitution or
       the sequence <b>${}</b>.

       The following expansions are available:

       <b>DEB_HOST_*</b>, <b>DEB_BUILD_*</b>, <b>DEB_TARGET_*</b>
           Expands to the relevant <a href="../man1/dpkg-architecture.1.html">dpkg-architecture(1)</a> value (similar
           to <i>dpkg-architecture -qVARIABLE_HERE</i>).

           When in doubt, the <b>DEB_HOST_* </b>variant is the one that will
           work both for native and cross builds.

           For performance reasons, debhelper will attempt to resolve
           these names from the environment first before consulting
           <a href="../man1/dpkg-architecture.1.html">dpkg-architecture(1)</a>.  This is mostly mentioned for
           completeness as it will not matter for most cases.

       <b>Dollar</b>
           Expands to a single literal <b>$</b>-symbol.  This symbol will <i>never</i>
           be considered part of a substitution variable.  That is:

              # Triggers an error
              ${NO_SUCH_TOKEN}
              # Expands to the literal value "${NO_SUCH_TOKEN}"
              ${Dollar}{NO_SUCH_TOKEN}

           This variable equivalent to the sequence <b>${} </b>and the two can
           be used interchangeably.

       <b>Newline</b>, <b>Space</b>, <b>Tab</b>
           Expands to a single ASCII newline, space and tab
           respectively.

           This can be useful if you need to include a literal
           whitespace character (e.g. space) where it would otherwise be
           stripped or used as a separator.

       [1menv:<i>NAME</i>
           Expands to the environment variable <i>NAME</i>.  The environment
           variable must be set (but can be set to the empty string).

       Note that all variables must expand to a defined value.  As an
       example, if debhelper sees <i>${env:FOO}</i>, then it will insist that
       the environment variable <i>FOO</i> is set (it can be set to the empty
       string).

       <i>Substitution limits</i>

       To avoid infinite loops and resource exhaustion, debhelper will
       stop with an error if the text contains many substitution
       variables (50) or they expand beyond a certain size (4096
       characters or 3x length of the original input - whichever is
       bigger).

       <i>Substitution limitations: filtering</i>

       The built-in substitution cannot be used to "filter" out content.
       Attempts to create "comments" or "empty lines" via substitution
       will result in those variables being considered a token in its
       own right with the content given.

       If you want filtering, consider using an executable debhelper
       config file with <b>dh-exec </b>as interpreter. The <b>dh-exec </b>tool
       supports several features out of the box. Though keep in mind
       that <b>dh-exec </b>has its own substitution logic that can feature
       interact with the one from debhelper.

   <b>Executable debhelper config files</b>
       If you need additional flexibility, many of the debhelper tools
       (e.g. <a href="../man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a>) support executing a config file as a script.

       To use this feature, simply mark the config file as executable
       (e.g. <b>chmod +x debian/<i>package</i>.install</b>) and the tool will attempt
       to execute it and use the output of the script.  In many cases,
       you can use <b>dh-exec</b>(1) as interpreter of the config file to
       retain most of the original syntax while getting the additional
       flexibility you need.

       When using executable debhelper config files, please be aware of
       the following:

       â€¢   The executable config file <b>must </b>exit with success (i.e. its
           return code should indicate success).

       â€¢   In compatibility level 13+, the output will be subject to
           substitutions (see "Substitutions in debhelper config files")
           where the tool support these.  Remember to be careful if your
           generator <i>also</i> provides substitutions as this can cause
           unnecessary confusion. Notably, the commonly used <b>dh-exec</b>
           tool has its own substitution support.

           Otherwise, the output will be used exactly as-is.  Notably,
           debhelper will <i>not</i> expand wildcards or strip comments or
           strip whitespace in the output it reads. The <b>dh-exec </b>tool has
           an output filter on by default that will prune these things
           out.

       If you need the package to build on a file system where you
       cannot disable the executable bit, then you can use <b>dh-exec</b>(1)
       and its <b>strip-output </b>script.
</pre> <h2>
SHARED DEBHELPER OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following command line options are supported by all debhelper
       programs.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Verbose mode: show commands that modify the package build
           directory.

           Note that verbose mode may also output other "internal"
           commands that do not directly affect the package build
           directory.

       <b>--no-act</b>
           Do not really do anything. If used with -v, the result is
           that the command will output what it would have done.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--arch</b>
           Act on architecture dependent packages that should be built
           for the <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH </b>architecture.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--indep</b>
           Act on all architecture independent packages.

       <b>-p</b><i>package</i>, <b>--package=</b><i>package</i>
           Act on the package named <i>package</i>. This option may be
           specified multiple times to make debhelper operate on a given
           set of packages.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--same-arch</b>
           Deprecated alias of <b>-a</b>.

           This option is removed in compat 12.

       <b>-N</b><i>package</i>, <b>--no-package=</b><i>package</i>
           Do not act on the specified package even if an <b>-a</b>, <b>-i</b>, or <b>-p</b>
           option lists the package as one that should be acted on.

       <b>--remaining-packages</b>
           Do not act on the packages which have already been acted on
           by this debhelper command earlier (i.e. if the command is
           present in the package debhelper log).  For example, if you
           need to call the command with special options only for a
           couple of binary packages, pass this option to the last call
           of the command to process the rest of packages with default
           settings.

       <b>-P</b><i>tmpdir</i>, <b>--tmpdir=</b><i>tmpdir</i>
           Use <i>tmpdir</i> for package build directory. The default is
           debian/<i>package</i>

       <b>--mainpackage=</b><i>package</i>
           <b>Deprecated</b>: This option has no practical use in compat 15 or
           later as the behaviour it affects is removed in compat 15.

           This little-used option changes the package which debhelper
           considers the "main package", that is, the first one listed
           in <i>debian/control</i>, and the one for which <i>debian/foo</i> files can
           be used instead of the usual <i>debian/package.foo</i> files.

       <b>-O=</b><i>option</i>|<i>bundle</i>
           This is used by <a href="../man1/dh.1.html">dh(1)</a> when passing user-specified options to
           all the commands it runs. If the command supports the
           specified option or option bundle, it will take effect. If
           the command does not support the option (or any part of an
           option bundle), it will be ignored.
</pre> <h2>
COMMON DEBHELPER OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following command line options are supported by some
       debhelper programs.  See the man page of each program for a
       complete explanation of what each option does.

       <b>-n  </b>Do not modify <i>postinst</i>, <i>postrm</i>, etc. scripts.

       <b>-X</b><i>item</i>, <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i>
           Exclude an item from processing. This option may be used
           multiple times, to exclude more than one thing. The <i>item</i> is
           typically part of a filename, and any file containing the
           specified text will be excluded.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Makes files or other items that are specified on the command
           line take effect in ALL packages acted on, not just the
           first.
</pre> <h2>
BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following command line options are supported by all of the
       <b>dh_auto_</b><i>*</i> debhelper programs. These programs support a variety of
       build systems, and normally heuristically determine which to use,
       and how to use them.  You can use these command line options to
       override the default behavior.  Typically these are passed to
       <a href="../man1/dh.1.html">dh(1)</a>, which then passes them to all the <b>dh_auto_</b><i>*</i> programs.

       <b>-S</b><i>buildsystem</i>, <b>--buildsystem=</b><i>buildsystem</i>
           Force use of the specified <i>buildsystem</i>, instead of trying to
           auto-select one which might be applicable for the package.

           Pass <b>none </b>as <i>buildsystem</i> to disable auto-selection.

       <b>-D</b><i>directory</i>, <b>--sourcedir=</b><i>directory</i>, <b>--sourcedirectory=</b><i>directory</i>
           Assume that the original package source tree is at the
           specified <i>directory</i> rather than the top level directory of
           the Debian source package tree.

           <b>Warning</b>: The <b>--sourcedir </b>variant matches a similar named
           option in <b>dh_install </b>and <b>dh_missing </b>(etc.) for historical
           reasons.  While they have a similar name, they have very
           distinct purposes and in some cases it can cause errors when
           this variant is passed to <b>dh </b>(when then passes it on to all
           tools).

       <b>-B</b>[<i>directory</i>], <b>--builddir</b>[<i>=directory</i>],
       <b>--builddirectory</b>[<i>=directory</i>]
           Enable out of source building and use the specified <i>directory</i>
           as the build directory. If <i>directory</i> parameter is omitted, a
           default build directory will be chosen.

           If this option is not specified, building will be done in
           source by default unless the build system requires or prefers
           out of source tree building.  In such a case, the default
           build directory will be used even if <b>--builddirectory </b>is not
           specified.

           If the build system prefers out of source tree building but
           still allows in source building, the latter can be re-enabled
           by passing a build directory path that is the same as the
           source directory path.

       <b>--parallel</b>, <b>--no-parallel</b>
           Control whether parallel builds should be used if underlying
           build system supports them.  The number of parallel jobs is
           controlled by the <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS </b>environment variable
           ("Debian Policy, section 4.9.1") at build time. It might also
           be subject to a build system specific limit.

           If neither option is specified, debhelper currently defaults
           to <b>--parallel </b>in compat 10 (or later) and <b>--no-parallel</b>
           otherwise.

           As an optimization, <b>dh </b>will try to avoid passing these
           options to subprocesses, if they are unnecessary and the only
           options passed.  Notably this happens when <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>
           does not have a <i>parallel</i> parameter (or its value is 1).

       <b>--max-parallel=</b><i>maximum</i>
           This option implies <b>--parallel </b>and allows further limiting
           the number of jobs that can be used in a parallel build. If
           the package build is known to only work with certain levels
           of concurrency, you can set this to the maximum level that is
           known to work, or that you wish to support.

           Notably, setting the maximum to 1 is effectively the same as
           using <b>--no-parallel</b>.

       <b>--reload-all-buildenv-variables</b>
           By default, <a href="../man1/dh.1.html">dh(1)</a> will compute several environment variables
           (e.g. by using <a href="../man1/dpkg-buildflags.1.html">dpkg-buildflags(1)</a>) and cache them to avoid
           having all <b>dh_auto_* </b>tool recompute them.

           When passing this option, the concrete <b>dh_auto_* </b>tool will
           ignore the cache from <a href="../man1/dh.1.html">dh(1)</a> and retrigger a rebuild of these
           variables.  This is useful in the very rare case where the
           package need to do multiple builds but with different
           <b>...FLAGS </b>options.  A concrete example would be needing to
           change the <b>-O </b>parameter in <b>CFLAGS </b>in the second build:

               export DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND=-O3

               %:
                   dh $@

               override_dh_auto_configure:
                   dh_auto_configure -Bbuild-deb ...
                   DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND=-Os dh_auto_configure \
                      --reload-all-buildenv-variables -Bbuild-udeb ...

           Without <b>--reload-all-buildenv-variables </b>in the second call to
           <a href="../man1/dh_auto_configure.1.html">dh_auto_configure(1)</a>, the change in <b>DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND</b>
           would be ignored as <a href="../man1/dh_auto_configure.1.html">dh_auto_configure(1)</a> would use the cached
           value of <b>CFLAGS </b>set by <a href="../man1/dh.1.html">dh(1)</a>.

           This option is only available with <b>debhelper (&gt;= 12.7~) </b>when
           the package uses compatibility level 9 or later.

       <b>--list</b>, <b>-l</b>
           List all build systems supported by debhelper on this system.
           The list includes both default and third party build systems
           (marked as such). Also shows which build system would be
           automatically selected, or which one is manually specified
           with the <b>--buildsystem </b>option.
</pre> <h2>
COMPATIBILITY LEVELS </h2>
<pre>
       From time to time, major non-backwards-compatible changes need to
       be made to debhelper, to keep it clean and well-designed as needs
       change and its author gains more experience. To prevent such
       major changes from breaking existing packages, the concept of
       debhelper compatibility levels was introduced. You must tell
       debhelper which compatibility level it should use, and it
       modifies its behavior in various ways.

       In current debhelper, you can specify the compatibility level in
       <i>debian/control</i> by adding a Build-Depends on the debhelper-compat
       package.  For example, to use v13 mode, ensure <i>debian/control</i>
       has:

         Build-Depends: debhelper-compat (= 13)

       This also serves as an appropriate versioned build dependency on
       a sufficient version of the debhelper package, so you do not need
       to specify a separate versioned build dependency on the debhelper
       package unless you need a specific point release of debhelper
       (such as for the introduction of a new feature or bugfix within a
       compatibility level).

       Note that debhelper does not provide debhelper-compat for
       experimental or beta compatibility levels; packages experimenting
       with those compatibility levels should put the compat level in
       the <b>X-DH-Compat </b>field of the source stanza of the <i>debian/control</i>
       file (or, if only for selected commands, the <b>DH_COMPAT</b>
       environment variable).

       Historically, debhelper required specifying the compatibility
       level in the file <i>debian/compat</i>, and debhelper up to version 14
       supports this for backward compatibility. To use this method, the
       <i>debian/compat</i> file should contain the compatibility level as a
       single number, and no other content. If you specify the
       compatibility level by this method, your package will also need a
       versioned build dependency on a version of the debhelper package
       equal to (or greater than) the compatibility level your package
       uses. So, if you specify compatibility level 13 in <i>debian/compat</i>,
       ensure <i>debian/control</i> has:

         Build-Depends: debhelper (&gt;= 13~)

       Note that you must use exactly one method for specifying the
       default debhelper compat level of the package. Whenever possible,
       the debhelper-compat build-dependency is recommended.

       If needed be, the <b>DH_COMPAT </b>environment variable can be used to
       override the compat level for a given command.  The feature is
       mostly useful for either temporarily upgrading a few commands to
       a new compat level or keeping a few commands on a lower compat
       level.  The feature is best used sparingly as it effectively
       introduces special-cases into the <i>debian/rules</i> file that may be
       surprising to maintainers or reviewers (or, in the long term, to
       yourself).

       Unless otherwise indicated, all debhelper documentation assumes
       that you are using the most recent compatibility level, and in
       most cases does not indicate if the behavior is different in an
       earlier compatibility level, so if you are not using the most
       recent compatibility level, you're advised to read below for
       notes about what is different in earlier compatibility levels.

   <b>Supported compatibility levels</b>
       The list of supported compatibility levels and the related
       upgrade check list has moved to
       <a href="debhelper-compat-upgrade-checklist.7.html">debhelper-compat-upgrade-checklist(7)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Multiple binary package support</b>
       If your source package generates more than one binary package,
       debhelper programs will default to acting on all binary packages
       when run. If your source package happens to generate one
       architecture dependent package, and another architecture
       independent package, this is not the correct behavior, because
       you need to generate the architecture dependent packages in the
       binary-arch <i>debian/rules</i> target, and the architecture independent
       packages in the binary-indep <i>debian/rules</i> target.

       To facilitate this, as well as give you more control over which
       packages are acted on by debhelper programs, all debhelper
       programs accept the <b>-a</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-p</b>, and <b>-s </b>parameters. These
       parameters are cumulative.  If none are given, debhelper programs
       default to acting on all packages listed in the control file,
       with the exceptions below.

       First, any package whose <b>Architecture </b>field in <b>debian/control</b>
       does not match the <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH </b>architecture will be excluded
       ("Debian Policy, section 5.6.8").

       Also, some additional packages may be excluded based on the
       contents of the <b>DEB_BUILD_PROFILES </b>environment variable and
       <b>Build-Profiles </b>fields in binary package stanzas in
       <b>debian/control</b>, according to the draft policy at
       &lt;<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BuildProfileSpec">https://wiki.debian.org/BuildProfileSpec</a>&gt;.

       <i>Interaction between package selections and Build-Profiles</i>

       Build-Profiles affect which packages are included in the package
       selections mechanisms in debhelper.  Generally, the package
       selections are described from the assumption that all packages
       are enabled.  This section describes how the selections react
       when a package is disabled due to the active Build-Profiles (or
       lack of active Build-Profiles).

       -a/--arch, -i/--indep OR no selection options (a raw "dh_X" call)
           The package disabled by Build-Profiles is silently excluded
           from the selection.

           Note you will receive a warning if <i>all</i> packages related to
           these selections are disabled.  In that case, it generally
           does not make sense to do the build in the first place.

       -N <i>package</i> / --no-package <i>package</i>
           The option is accepted and effectively does nothing.

       -p <i>package</i> / --package <i>package</i>
           The option is accepted, but debhelper will not act on the
           package.

       Note that it does not matter whether a package is enabled or
       disabled by default.

   <b>Automatic generation of Debian install scripts</b>
       Some debhelper commands will automatically generate parts of
       Debian maintainer scripts. If you want these automatically
       generated things included in your existing Debian maintainer
       scripts, then you need to add <b>#DEBHELPER# </b>to your scripts, in the
       place the code should be added.  <b>#DEBHELPER# </b>will be replaced by
       any auto-generated code when you run <b>dh_installdeb</b>.

       If a script does not exist at all and debhelper needs to add
       something to it, then debhelper will create the complete script.

       All debhelper commands that automatically generate code in this
       way let it be disabled by the -n parameter (see above).

       Note that the inserted code will be shell code, so you cannot
       directly use it in a Perl script. If you would like to embed it
       into a Perl script, here is one way to do that (note that I made
       sure that $1, $2, etc are set with the set command):

         my $temp="set -e\nset -- @ARGV\n" . &lt;&lt; 'EOF';
         #DEBHELPER#
         EOF
         if (system($temp)) {
            my $exit_code = ($? &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff;
            my $signal = $? &amp; 0x7f;
            if ($exit_code) {
                die("The debhelper script failed with error code: ${exit_code}");
            } else {
                die("The debhelper script was killed by signal: ${signal}");
            }
         }

   <b>Automatic generation of miscellaneous dependencies.</b>
       Some debhelper commands may make the generated package need to
       depend on some other packages. For example, if you use
       <a href="../man1/dh_installdebconf.1.html">dh_installdebconf(1)</a>, your package will generally need to depend
       on debconf. Or if you use <a href="../man1/dh_installxfonts.1.html">dh_installxfonts(1)</a>, your package will
       generally need to depend on a particular version of xutils.
       Keeping track of these miscellaneous dependencies can be annoying
       since they are dependent on how debhelper does things, so
       debhelper offers a way to automate it.

       All commands of this type, besides documenting what dependencies
       may be needed on their man pages, will automatically generate a
       substvar called <b>${misc:Depends}</b>. If you put that token into your
       <i>debian/control</i> file, it will be expanded to the dependencies
       debhelper figures you need.

       This is entirely independent of the standard <b>${shlibs:Depends}</b>
       generated by <a href="../man1/dh_makeshlibs.1.html">dh_makeshlibs(1)</a>, and the <b>${perl:Depends} </b>generated
       by <a href="../man1/dh_perl.1.html">dh_perl(1)</a>.  You can choose not to use any of these, if
       debhelper's guesses don't match reality.

   <b>Package build directories</b>
       By default, all debhelper programs assume that the temporary
       directory used for assembling the tree of files in a package is
       debian/<i>package</i>.

       Sometimes, you might want to use some other temporary directory.
       This is supported by the <b>-P </b>flag. For example, "<b>dh_installdocs</b>
       <b>-Pdebian/tmp</b>", will use <b>debian/tmp </b>as the temporary directory.
       Note that if you use <b>-P</b>, the debhelper programs can only be
       acting on a single package at a time. So if you have a package
       that builds many binary packages, you will need to also use the
       <b>-p </b>flag to specify which binary package the debhelper program
       will act on.

   <b>udebs</b>
       Debhelper includes support for udebs. To create a udeb with
       debhelper, add "<b>Package-Type: udeb</b>" to the package's stanza in
       <i>debian/control</i>.  Debhelper will try to create udebs that comply
       with debian-installer policy, by making the generated package
       files end in <i>.udeb</i>, not installing any documentation into a udeb,
       skipping over <i>preinst</i>, <i>postrm</i>, <i>prerm</i>, and <i>config</i> scripts, etc.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       This section describes some of the environment variables that
       influences the behaviour of debhelper or which debhelper
       interacts with.

       It is important to note that these must be actual environment
       variables in order to affect the behaviour of debhelper (not
       simply <i>Makefile</i> variables).  To specify them properly in
       <i>debian/rules</i>, be sure to "<b>export</b>" them. For example, "<b>export</b>
       <b>DH_VERBOSE</b>".

       <b>DH_VERBOSE</b>
           Set to a non-empty value to enable verbose mode.  Please see
           the <b>-v </b>/ <b>--verbose </b>option for details.

       <b>DH_QUIET</b>
           Set to a non-empty value to enable quiet mode. Debhelper will
           not output commands calling the upstream build system nor
           will dh print which subcommands are called and depending on
           the upstream build system might make that more quiet, too.
           This makes it easier to spot important messages but makes the
           output quite useless as buildd log.

           Ignored if DH_VERBOSE is also set or <b>-v </b>/ <b>--verbose </b>is
           passed.

       <b>DH_COMPAT</b>
           Temporarily specifies what compatibility level debhelper
           should run at, overriding the default compat level of the
           source package.

       <b>DH_NO_ACT</b>
           Set to <b>1 </b>to enable no-act mode.

       <b>DH_OPTIONS</b>
           All debhelper tools will parse command line arguments listed
           in this variable before any command option (as if they had
           been prepended to the command line arguments).
           Unfortunately, some third-party provided tools may not
           support this variable and will ignore these command line
           arguments.

           When using <a href="../man1/dh.1.html">dh(1)</a>, it can be passed options that will be
           passed on to each debhelper command, which is generally
           better than using DH_OPTIONS.

       <b>DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE</b>
           If set, this adds the value the variable is set to to the <b>-X</b>
           options of all commands that support the <b>-X </b>option. Moreover,
           <b>dh_builddeb </b>will <b>rm -rf </b>anything that matches the value in
           your package build tree.

           This can be useful if you are doing a build from a CVS source
           tree, in which case setting <b>DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE=CVS </b>will
           prevent any CVS directories from sneaking into the package
           you build. Or, if a package has a source tarball that
           (unwisely) includes CVS directories, you might want to export
           <b>DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE=CVS </b>in <i>debian/rules</i>, to make it take effect
           wherever your package is built.

           Multiple things to exclude can be separated with colons, as
           in <b>DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE=CVS:.svn</b>

       <b>DH_EXTRA_ADDONS</b>
           If set, this adds the specified dh addons to be run in the
           appropriate places in the sequence of commands. This is
           equivalent to specifying the addon to run with the --with
           flag in the debian/rules file. Any --without calls specifying
           an addon in this environment variable will not be run.

           This is intended to be used by downstreams or specific local
           configurations that require a debhelper addon to be run
           during multiple builds without having to patch a large number
           of rules file. If at all possible, this should be avoided in
           favor of a --with flag in the rules file.

       <b>DH_COLORS</b>, <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           These variables can be used to control whether debhelper
           commands should use colors in their textual output.  Can be
           set to "always", "auto" (the default), or "never".

           Note that <b>DPKG_COLOR </b>also affects a number of dpkg related
           tools and debhelper uses it on the assumption that you want
           the same color setting for dpkg and debhelper.  In the off-
           hand chance you want different color setting for debhelper,
           you can use <b>DH_COLORS </b>instead or in addition to <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>.

       <b>NO_COLOR</b>
           If no explicit request for color has been given (e.g.
           <b>DH_COLORS </b>and <b>DPKG_COLORS </b>are both unset), the presence of
           this environment variable cause the default color setting to
           be "never".

           The variable is defined according to &lt;<a href="https://no-color.org/">https://no-color.org/</a>&gt;.
           In this project, the environment variables (such as
           <b>DH_COLORS</b>) are considered an explicit request for color.

       <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CPPFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>GCJFLAGS</b>,
       <b>FFLAGS</b>, <b>FCFLAGS</b>, <b>LDFLAGS</b>
           By default (in any non-deprecated compat level), debhelper
           will automatically set these flags by using
           <a href="../man1/dpkg-buildflags.1.html">dpkg-buildflags(1)</a>, when they are unset.  If you need to
           change the default flags, please use the features from
           <a href="../man1/dpkg-buildflags.1.html">dpkg-buildflags(1)</a> to do this (e.g.
           <b>DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS=hardening=all </b>or
           <b>DEB_CPPFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND=-DCUSTOM_MACRO=true</b>) rather than
           setting the concrete variable directly.

       <b>HOME</b>, <b>XDG_*</b>
           In compat 13 and later, these environment variables are reset
           before invoking the upstream build system via the <b>dh_auto_*</b>
           helpers.  The variables <b>HOME </b>(all <b>dh_auto_* </b>helpers) and
           <b>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR </b>(<b>dh_auto_test </b>only) will be set to a writable
           directory. All remaining variables and <b>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</b>
           (except for during <b>dh_auto_test</b>) will be cleared.

           The <b>HOME </b>directory will be created as an empty directory but
           it will be reused between calls to <b>dh_auto_*</b>.  Any content
           will persist until explicitly deleted or <b>dh_clean</b>.

       <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>
           Please see "Supported flags in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS" for this
           environment variable.

           Please note that this variable should <i>not</i> be altered by
           package maintainers inside <i>debian/rules</i> to change the
           behaviour of debhelper.  Instead, where the package
           maintainer need these features, they should look disabling
           the relevant feature directly (e.g. by overriding the
           concrete tools).

       <b>DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS</b>
           This is a dpkg specific environment variable (see e.g.
           <a href="../man1/dpkg-buildflags.1.html">dpkg-buildflags(1)</a>).  The debhelper tool suite silently
           ignores it.

           It is documented here because it has a similar name to
           <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>, which make some people mistakenly assume
           that debhelper will also react to this variable.

   <b>Supported flags in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>
       The debhelper tool suite reacts to the following flags in
       <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>.

       <b>dherroron=obsolete-compat-levels</b>
           <i>This is a debhelper specific value.</i>

           When <b>dherroron </b>is present and set to <b>obsolete-compat-levels</b>,
           then debhelper tools will promote deprecation warnings for
           usage of old soon to be removed compat levels into errors.

           This is useful for automated checking for code relying on
           deprecated compat levels that is scheduled for removal.

           This option is intended for testing purposes; not production
           builds.

       <b>nostrip</b>
           <i>This value will change the content of the debs being built.</i>
           <i>The .deb packages built when this is set is therefore not</i>
           <i>bit-for-bit reproducible with a regular build in the general</i>
           <i>case.</i>

           This value will cause the official debhelper tools will skip
           actions and helpers that either remove, detach or deduplicate
           debugging symbols in ELF binaries.

           This value affects <a href="../man1/dh_dwz.1.html">dh_dwz(1)</a> and <a href="../man1/dh_strip.1.html">dh_strip(1)</a>.

       <b>nocheck</b>
           This value will cause the official debhelper build systems to
           skip runs of upstream test suites.

           Package maintainers looking to avoid running the upstream
           tests should <b>not </b>rely on this.  Instead, they can add an
           empty override target to skip <b>dh_auto_test</b>.

           This value affects <a href="../man1/dh_auto_test.1.html">dh_auto_test(1)</a>.

       <b>nodoc</b>
           <i>This value will change the content of the debs being built.</i>
           <i>The .deb packages built when this is set is therefore not</i>
           <i>bit-for-bit reproducible with a regular build in the general</i>
           <i>case.</i>

           This value will cause several debhelper tools to skip
           installation of documentation such as manpages or upstream
           provided documentation.  Additionally, the tools will also
           ignore if declared documentation is "missing" on the
           assumption that the documentation has not been built.

           This value effects tools <i>like</i> <a href="../man1/dh_installdocs.1.html">dh_installdocs(1)</a>, which <i>knows</i>
           it is working with documentation.

       <b>notrimdch</b>
           <i>This value will change the content of the debs being built.</i>
           <i>The .deb packages built when this is set is therefore not</i>
           <i>bit-for-bit reproducible with a regular build in the general</i>
           <i>case.</i>

           This value will cause <a href="../man1/dh_installchangelogs.1.html">dh_installchangelogs(1)</a> to act as if it
           had been passed the <b>--no-trim </b>option, forcing it to forgo
           removing older entries from changelogs.

       <b>noautodbgsym</b>, <b>noddebs</b>
           <i>The official name is noautodbgsym.</i>  <i>The noddebs variant is</i>
           <i>accepted for historical reasons.</i>

           This value causes debhelper to skip the generation of
           automatically generated debug symbol packages.

           This value affects <a href="../man1/dh_strip.1.html">dh_strip(1)</a>.

       <b>parallel=N</b>
           This value enables debhelper to use up to <b>N </b>threads or
           processes (subject to parameters like <b>--no-parallel </b>and
           <b>--max-parallel=M</b>).  Not all debhelper tools work with
           parallel tasks and may silently ignore the request.

           This value affects many debhelper tools.  Most notably
           <b>dh_auto_*</b>, which will attempt to run the underlying upstream
           build system with that number of threads.

       <b>terse</b>
           This value will cause the official debhelper build systems to
           configure upstream builds to be terse (i.e. reduce verbosity
           in their output).  This is subject to the upstream and the
           debhelper build system supporting such features.

           This value affects most <b>dh_auto_* </b>tools directly. For
           commands provided by the debhelper package, it also causes
           the tools to act like the <b>DH_QUIET </b>environment variable was
           non-empty.

       Unknown flags are silently ignored.

       Note third-party debhelper-like tools or third-party provided
       build systems may or may not react to the above flags.  This
       tends to depend on implementation details of the tool.
